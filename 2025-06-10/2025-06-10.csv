            France said it has received a letter from the Palestinian Authority that contains “concrete and unprecedented commitments” to reform as Paris prepares to co-chair a conference on Palestinian statehood in New York.
    


            The letter, which France said was signed by Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas, includes condemnation of the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, a call on Hamas to immediately release all hostages, and pledges to hold elections and reform the authority, according to excerpts shared with CNN.
    


            “Hamas will no longer rule Gaza and must hand over its weapons and military capabilities to the Palestinian Security Forces, which will oversee their removal outside the occupied Palestinian territory, with Arab and international support,” the Élysée Palace cited Abbas as writing.
    


            The letter France says it received comes as anticipation builds around whether President Emmanuel Macron might recognize the State of Palestine at a summit next week aimed at building support for Palestinian statehood at the United Nations. France is co-chairing the summit with Saudi Arabia.
    


            CNN has reached out to the PA for comment. Its official news agency Wafa, which often reports on the president's correspondence, made no mention of the letter.
    


            France said Abbas pledged to organize presidential and general elections within a year in order to “rejuvenate the Palestinian governance.”
    


            Abbas, 89, is deeply unpopular among Palestinians. He has led the PA since the death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in 2004 and has clung to power despite being seen by critics as lacking democratic legitimacy. Proposals put forth by Arab states for a post-war Gaza have excluded Hamas from governance and called for the reformation of the PA.
    


The Guardian reported on Saturday that France may be retreating from its plan. The conference “has weakened its ambition and will instead hope to agree on steps towards recognition,” The Guardian said, citing diplomats, adding that “French officials briefing their Israeli counterparts this week reassured them the conference will not be the moment for recognition.”

            However, an Élysée source told CNN that the French presidency refutes such reports, and that Paris is moving in the direction of recognizing a Palestinian state.
    


            “We can clearly see that some have an interest in suggesting that we are not moving in the direction of recognition. That is false,” the source said Tuesday, adding that “we are determined to recognize a Palestinian state in order to create the conditions for the state's existence.”
    


            The source highlighted the importance of the upcoming conference at the UN.
    


            “Recognizing Palestinian statehood is consistent with France's position in support of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people,” the source said. “As part of the June 18 conference, it must contribute meaningfully to the momentum behind implementing the two-state solution, based on the principles reaffirmed by the President of the Republic.”
    


            France would be the most prominent Western country to recognize Palestinian statehood. Last year, Spain, Ireland and Norway formally recognized the State of Palestine in a move that provoked backlash from Israel.

            A shooter opened fire at a high school in the Austrian city of Graz on Tuesday, killing ﻿10 people, including teenagers, in one of the worst rampages in the country's history.
    


            Austrian police and hospital officials confirmed the fatalities, raising the death toll from an earlier figure of nine. The country's interior ministry told CNN that the victims included children between 14 and 18 years old.
    


            Interior minister Gerhard Karner said at a news conference that six victims were female and three were male. Twelve students were injured in the incident, some of them seriously, Karner added. Graz University Hospital later said one of the seriously injured adults died on Tuesday evening.
    


            The suspect – a 21-year-old Austrian male who had previously attended the school but not graduated – used two weapons, a shotgun and a pistol, to carry out the killing spree, before fatally shooting himself in a bathroom, authorities said at the news conference.
    


            Officials would not give a motive for the gunman, who they say acted alone. Police believe he obtained the weapons he used legally. The weapons were seized at the scene and subject to forensic examinations. Officers are also continuing to conduct interviews as they investigate the circumstances of the incident, police added.
    


            The shooting pitched Austria into a state of shock and disbelief. Chancellor Christian Stocker announced three days of national mourning, writing on X: “There are no words for the pain and grief.”
    


            Officers first responded to the reports of “several” suspected gunshots at the Bundesoberstufenrealgymnasium Dreierschützengasse school in the northwest of Graz at around 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET).
    


            Several vehicles and a police helicopter were deployed to the site. The school was evacuated and the area was secured, with no further danger expected, the police said on social media. Police said later in a statement that special forces were also deployed to the scene.
    


            The injured were taken to nearby hospitals for medical treatment, police also said.
    


            Stocker expressed horror at the shooting, writing on X: “The rampage at a school in Graz is a national tragedy that has deeply shaken our entire country. This inconceivable act suddenly tore young people from the life they still had ahead of them.”
    


            Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said: “It is difficult to bear when schools become places of death and violence.”
    


            Gun violence is rare in Austria, along with most central European countries. The country's rate of firearm homicides was just 0.1 per 100,000 people in 2021, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, compared to 4.5 per 100,000 people in the United States.
    


            But Austria's gun ownership is higher than most European Union countries; there are 30 civilian firearms owned for every 100 citizens, according to the Small Arms Survey, a research institute based in Switzerland.
    


            A small number of high-profile violent incidents have taken place there in recent years. Last October, the mayor of a northern Austrian town was shot dead, along with another victim.
    


            In February, a 23-year-old man stabbed five passersby in southern Austria in what police said was a random attack.

Follow:


            Swedish climate and human rights activist Greta Thunberg departed Israel on a flight to France on Tuesday after being detained by Israeli forces alongside other activists aboard an aid ship bound for Gaza.
    


            “Greta Thunberg just departed Israel on a flight to Sweden (via France),” Israel's foreign ministry wrote in a post on X alongside two photos of the young activist aboard a plane.
    


            Thunberg, 22, is a well-known climate activist who has long eschewed air travel, famously sailing to a climate conference in New York in 2019.
    


            The Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC), which organized the aid ship, the Madleen, said that four of the 12 activists who had been on board left Israel on Tuesday: Thunberg, two French citizens and a Spanish citizen. Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament, remains in detention, along with seven other activists from Turkey, the Netherlands, France, Brazil and Germany, it said.
    


            “Over the last days and hours, the President of the European Parliament has been in constant contact with the Israeli authorities…to ensure the safety and security of the Member of the European Parliament, Rima Hassan, who was one of the people aboard the boat Madleen and all those accompanying her,” Delphine Colard, a spokesperson for the European Parliament, said on Monday.
    


            Adalah, an Israel-based non-governmental legal organization that is representing some of the activists, said that those who remain are being held in Givon Prison in Ramleh, central Israel.
    


            France's foreign minister said that crew members who refused to agree to depart voluntarily would be deported.
    


            “Last night our consul was able to see the six French nationals who were arrested by the Israeli authorities. Their families have been contacted. One of them agreed to a voluntary departure and is expected to return today. The other five will be deported,” Jean-Noël Barrot wrote in a post on X.
    


            Israel's foreign ministry had said earlier that anyone who refused to sign deportation documents and leave Israel would be brought before judicial authorities to authorize their deportation.
    


            The detained crew of the Gaza-bound aid ship that was intercepted by Israel on Monday morning docked in the Israeli port of Ashdod Monday evening, according to Israel's foreign ministry.
    


            The Madleen is part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an organization that has campaigned against Israel's blockade of Gaza and tried to break the siege by boat.
    


            The FFC said the Israeli military had “attacked” and “unlawfully boarded” the Madleen which was attempting to deliver aid to Gaza – where more than 600 days of war, and an 11-week Israeli blockade of all aid, has pushed the enclave's 2.1 million people deeper into a hunger crisis.
    


            Amnesty International also condemned the detention of the activists.
    


            “The operation of intercepting and blocking the Madleen in the middle of the night and in international waters violates international law and put the safety of those on the boat at risk,” Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International's secretary general, said in a statement.
    


            In a statement to CNN, Israel said that it “is preventing the entry of all vessels into the Gaza Strip, in accordance with international law.”
    


            Israel had repeatedly vowed to stop the aid boat from reaching Gaza and described the ship as a “selfie yacht” carrying “celebrities.”
    


            Israel imposed a full humanitarian blockade of Gaza on March 2, cutting off food, medical supplies, and other aid to the more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the territory for 11 weeks.
    


            Faced with growing international pressure, Israel began allowing a trickle of aid in late May. But humanitarian organizations say it is only a fraction of the aid that entered the enclave before the war, and have warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis and the growing risk of widespread famine. A UN-backed report warned in late April that one in five people were facing starvation.
    


            Dozens of Palestinians have been killed over the past week while on their way to try and obtain aid from a new US-backed group commissioned to deliver aid to Gaza, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The group is intended to replace the UN-led system of distributing aid in Gaza. The United Nations has warned that the new distribution mechanism has become a “death trap” for desperate people seeking food in the strip.

The Poles, captained by Inter Milan midfielder Piotr Zieliński, are aiming for a third straight win to strengthen their lead in the qualifying group.

Oficjalny trening przed meczem Finlandia - Polska na Stadionie Olimpijskim w Helsinkach 🇫🇮🏟️ pic.twitter.com/fdJM8BNYQ4

Poland are ranked 34th worldwide by football's governing body FIFA, while Finland are No. 69 in the FIFA table.

The match will be closely watched following star striker Robert Lewandowski's announcement that he will no longer play for the national team as long as head coach Michał Probierz remains in charge.

Lewandowski's announcement came after a statement by the Polish Football Association (PZPN) that Zieliński had been appointed the new team captain, following a decision by Probierz.

On Monday, Probierz told a news conference that his decision to strip Lewandowski of the captain's armband was made ""solely for the good of the team.""

In an interview published on Monday, Lewandowski said he had lost trust in Probierz.

""The coach broke my trust,"" the 36-year-old said. ""I want to stress that this isn't about me being offended or putting myself above the team. For years, I've always given everything I had. The national team has always been my top priority. But what happened has hurt me deeply.""

On Friday, the Polish team defeated Moldova 2–0 in a home friendly at the Silesian Stadium in the southern city of Chorzów. Lewandowski attended that match but did not play.

The Polish team opened its World Cup qualifying campaign in March with home wins over Lithuania (1-0) and Malta (2-0).

Poland's qualifying Group G also includes the Netherlands and Finland.

The 2026 World Cup will be held from June 11 to July 19, 2026 in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Poland reached the last 16 of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar before being eliminated by eventual runners-up France.

US President Donald Trump has backed a proposal by White House border czar Tom Homan to have California Governor Gavin Newsom arrested for allegedly obstructing his administration's immigration enforcement efforts.

Homan, the White House executive associate director of enforcement and removal operations, earlier said the governor and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass could face federal charges for attempting to impede immigration agents.

This marked a sharp escalation following the president's decision to deploy the National Guard and active-duty Marines to help quell riots sparked by the arrests of suspected illegal immigrants.

“I would do it if I were Tom. I think it's great,” Trump said, responding to a reporter's question about whether he endorses Homan's proposal to arrest state officials who interfere with federal immigration raids.

“Gavin likes the publicity but I think it would be a great thing. He's done a terrible job… Look, I like Gavin Newsom, he's a nice guy, but he's grossly incompetent.”

Trump's remarks come as Los Angeles enters its fourth straight day of protests, which began on Friday after the immigration authorities arrested over 40 people at a Home Depot parking lot and a clothing factory for allegedly using false documents. Demonstrations against Trump's immigration policy quickly escalated into looting and violent clashes with police.

Similar protests have erupted in cities across the nation, including San Francisco, New York, Atlanta, Seattle, Dallas, and Louisville. 

Tensions rose after Homan warned that officials, including Newsom and Bass, could face arrest if they obstruct federal operations.

“It's a felony to knowingly harbor and conceal an illegal alien” and to impede law enforcement from “doing their job,” Homan told NBC News on Saturday. He added that neither official has “crossed the line yet.”

Newsom dismissed Homan's threat in an interview on Sunday with MSNBC, urging him to “just get it over with” and make the arrest.

“He's a tough guy. Why doesn't he do that? He knows where to find me,” Newsom said. “That kind of bloviating is exhausting. So, Tom, arrest me. Let's go.”

He also blasted the deployment of an additional 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, bypassing the governor's authority, calling it a “serious breach of state sovereignty.”

Newsom, a Democrat and potential 2028 presidential candidate, filed a federal lawsuit in San Francisco on Monday against Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and the Defense Department, aiming to overturn the president's order to deploy the National Guard.

In a post on X, Newsom wrote that Trump “flamed the fires and illegally acted to federalize the National Guard.”

The Pentagon will deploy active-duty Marines to help quell riots in Los Angeles sparked by the arrests of suspected illegal immigrants.

Around 700 Marines from the 1st Marine Division will assist in protecting “federal personnel and federal property in the greater Los Angeles area,” US Northern Command said on Monday.

The Marines will support National Guard troops, whose presence on the streets is expected to increase to 2,000 by Wednesday, according to Reuters.

“We have an obligation to defend federal law enforcement officers – even if Gavin Newsom will not,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X. The Pentagon announced later on Monday that “an additional” 2,000 National Guard members will be called to assist immigration agents and police. 

California Governor Gavin Newsom blasted President Donald Trump's decision to send in the Marines against protesters as “un-American.”

“They shouldn't be deployed on American soil facing their own countrymen to fulfill the deranged fantasy of a dictatorial president,” Newsom wrote on X. He earlier urged Trump to recall the National Guard, arguing that their “unlawful” deployment is escalatory and violates California's rights as a state.

The protests erupted on Friday after the immigration authorities arrested over 40 people at a Home Depot parking lot and at the Ambiance Apparel clothing manufacturer on suspicion of using “fictitious employee documents.” Demonstrations denouncing Trump's hardline immigration policy quickly spiraled into looting and violent clashes with police.

Rioters torched vehicles and broke into businesses, and police fired pepper balls and rubber bullets to disperse crowds. At least 56 people were arrested over the weekend, according to news agencies.

Trump condemned the “insurrectionists,” vowing to protect law enforcement officers. “IF THEY SPIT, WE WILL HIT, and I promise you they will be hit harder than they have ever been hit before. Such disrespect will not be tolerated!” the president wrote on his Truth Social platform.

During his campaign, Trump pledged to crack down on illegal immigration and ramp up deportations. According to Axios, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller instructed immigration agents last week to raise their daily arrest quota from 1,000 to 3,000.

Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has told American journalist Tucker Carlson that he had never been arrested by authorities in Russia.

The tech mogul was detained by French police last year on suspicion of committing a flurry of cybercrimes.

In an interview released on Monday, Carlson noted that the Russian-born tech entrepreneur left the country more than a decade ago for political reasons. He asked him if he had ever faced arrest in Russia, to which Durov replied that he had not.

Durov was arrested in August 2024 at Paris–Le Bourget Airport, charged with 12 offenses linked to Telegram's handling of illegal content, including child exploitation material and narcotics trafficking, and prevented from leaving France for seven months. He was released in March having posted €5 million ($5.4 million) bail.

Asked if he sees any irony in only being arrested in France, a country that is viewed as “part of the free West,” Durov said Paris “was the most unexpected place to get arrested for me.”

Durov said that he had visited several countries before arriving in France, some of which “are considered in the West to be autocratic or authoritarian.” He added that in many such nations, Telegram is popular because it provides “100% privacy.”

Carlson pointed to a possible contrast in public reaction someone else of a similar profile had been arrested. “If Mark Zuckerberg or Elon [Musk] got grabbed… you'd be like ‘Stop—what? The world is ending.' But they grabbed you and people are like, ‘Oh, he's got a Russian last name, it's fine. I'm sure there's a good reason.'”

“I hope it had nothing to do with my ethnicity,” Durov replied. “Because that would be very alarming.”

Durov has denied the French charges, calling them absurd. His arrest sparked an outpouring of sympathy worldwide, as well as accusations that France is infringing on freedom of speech.

In late May, Durov claimed that the French government had sought to make Telegram block conservative voices in Romania ahead of the country's presidential runoff, but he refused. French officials have in-turn, denied the claim.

MOSCOW, June 10. /TASS/. Russia and Ukraine exchanged POWs under the age of 25, protests continue to escalate in California, and the US and China initiated negotiations on rare earth metals. These stories topped Tuesday's headlines across Russia.

 

Ukraine's delays in fulfilling agreements with Russia are related to domestic factors and Kiev's relations with its backers, Rodion Miroshnik, the Russian Foreign Ministry's ambassador-at-large in charge of overseeing the Kiev regime's crimes, told Izvestia. Experts add that Ukraine's current authorities are afraid of losing face, which would exacerbate negative attitudes domestically. On June 9, Russia and Ukraine held the first swap of prisoners of war under the age of 25 even though agreements on this were reached in Istanbul a week ago. Moscow also offered Kiev to return the bodies of dead soldiers; however, Kiev has not yet taken its servicemen back. Against this background, Russian and Belarusian foreign ministers will discuss the situation around Ukraine.

Miroshnik told Izvestia that Russia has completely fulfilled the agreements, the ball is in Ukraine's court, and the responsibility for the official reaction to the humanitarian initiative proposed by Russia rests with the Kiev regime.

The Ukrainian authorities do not want to accept the bodies of their soldiers because such a number of fatalities undermines all narratives promoted by Ukrainian propaganda. Additionally, the majority of soldiers being handed over were killed in the Kursk area, while waging combat there was Zelensky's personal initiative, former Verkhovna Rada deputy Spiridon Kilinkarov told Izvestia.

""I am confident that they will try to stall this procedure for as long as possible, questioning it, conducting a multitude of expert evaluations, and attempt to remove this issue from the spotlight so that the Ukrainians won't focus on it,"" he explained.

Launching talks and continuing them is necessary in the very least to return soldiers home. Not only is this an argument against those who oppose interaction with Kiev but also a vivid demonstration that Russia is thinking about its servicemen in captivity and is making every diplomatic effort to release them, analyst Tigran Meloyan from the HSE Mediterranean Studies Center said.

Swapping POWs and the bodies of those killed always precedes the main talks on settling the conflict. This way, the sides are trying to alleviate the sharpest aspects of the standoff and display readiness to continue the discussion. That said, the conflict's main topics, for instance, Ukraine's neutral status and territorial issues, cannot be resolved independently by Kiev, professor Natalya Yeremina of St. Petersburg State University concluded.

 

Tough measures against protest rallies of migrants in California may lead to the loss of support for Donald Trump as well as give Democrats an excuse to criticize his policies, experts believe. The protests in Los Angeles have been underway for over three days. Earlier, about 6,000 people took to the streets waving Mexican flags, setting cars on fire, hurling stones and Molotov cocktails. Reacting to this, Trump ordered the deployment of about 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles bypassing California's authorities, which has already triggered criticism.

The harsh methods of dispersing mass protests will definitely affect Trump's rankings even more, Konstantin Blokhin, a leading researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Center for Security Studies, told Izvestia.

""This is precisely what the Democrats are waiting for because any suppression of protests will be used by them in the context of internal political clashes. Trump will definitely be labeled a 'bloody despot,' 'a tyrant,' 'a Fascist' and 'a racist.' And here Trump is at a crossroads: on the one hand, it is necessary to display sufficient toughness (such as deploying the National Guard), but not excessive because this would lead to backlash,"" the expert noted.

At this stage, it is difficult to talk about the effectiveness of Trump's anti-migrant policy, Blokhin explained. Not much time has elapsed but the US leader cannot abandon this issue because it was one of his main promises during his election campaign.

The protests in Los Angeles are considered legitimate as long as they remain peaceful, believes Pavel Koshkin, a senior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for US and Canadian Studies. In a conversation with Vedomosti, the expert noted that the authorities have the right to use force if the violence escalates, which gives Trump justification to deploy the National Guard. California Governor Gavin Newsom must present convincing counterarguments in court, citing the state's autonomy. The specialist believes Newsom has a reasonable chance of winning the case in liberal California, but success is less likely if it reaches the Supreme Court due to the prevailing conservative majority there.

The protests may be supported in other US states, for example, in Florida and Massachusetts where the immigration issue is also pressing, believes Director of the Center for North American Studies at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Victoria Zhuravleva. That said, she told Vedomosti that the conflict between Trump and the Californian authorities goes beyond the sphere of migration policy - this is a standoff between the federal center and liberal states. For Newsom, the situation became an opportunity to signal his presidential ambitions while defending California's interests. In turn, Trump is using the crisis to expand the capabilities of federal power, she noted.

 

High-ranking representatives from the US and China held a new round of trade talks in London on June 9. It was expected that they would focus on the issues of Beijing's export control over rare-earth metals, which has tightened since the onset of an all-out trade war. This issue was discussed by the leaders of the two countries in a phone conversation on June 5, Director of the National Economic Council of the United States Kevin Hassett said in an interview with CBS News on June 8.

According to Head of the Sector of Economy and Politics of China at the Center for Asia-Pacific Studies at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Sergey Lukonin, it will be difficult for the Chinese delegation to get clear obligations on changing trade policies from the US.

""China's economy is displaying greater stability compared to the American one,"" he emphasized. The US remains dependent on Chinese products, and American businesses in China are interested in retaining the current economic relations. The expert noted the record-high drop in Chinese exports to the US to the 2020 levels which, however, is not critical for the scale of China's economy. ""Some export flows were redirected to Southeast Asia, for example, to Vietnam,"" the expert explained. Speaking of China's potential response measures, Lukonin is forecasting continued subsidies for the export sector, bolstered control over rare-earth metals supply chains, and the introduction of selective restrictions on the purchases of US goods.

China will be forced to concede because the threat of high tariffs remains an effective ultimatum on the part of the US, believes independent analyst Andrey Kochetkov. In his opinion, a major purchase of US agricultural products by China may become a potential way out of the current situation, just as it happened during Trump's first presidential term. Kochetkov questions the stability of China's position in the sphere of control over rare earths: ""The restrictions may trigger an opposite effect, stimulating the development of their extraction technologies in other countries, including the US."" Kochetkov points out that currently both sides are in a balanced position, and the ""current talks will inevitably be based on mutual compromises.""

 

Saudi Arabia insists on retaining the accelerated pace of increasing oil production by the eight countries of the OPEC+ alliance in August and September, Bloomberg said citing sources.

This involves the OPEC+ eight members, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, Algeria, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, and Oman, abandoning their voluntary reduction of oil production to 2.2 million barrels per day. The return to oil volumes previously removed from the market by the alliance began in April.

Valery Andrianov, associate professor at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, believes that Russia has significant prospects in terms of increasing oil production. It is enough to recall the Vostok Oil project, which will be launched relatively soon with an annual production of up to 100 million tons. However, for Russia, it is not the opportunity to boost oil output but the infrastructure bottlenecks for raw material exports such as ice-class tankers that becomes more pressing.

According to Andrianov, currently, Saudi Arabia is pursuing the only viable strategy, a gradual distancing from the use of the OPEC+ mechanism while saving face. The oil alliance has largely lost its effectiveness, and any further reduction in production would result in losing more and more market niches without any significant surge in global prices.

According to Finam analyst Nikolay Dudchenko, there are several possible explanations behind OPEC+ increasing oil production. The first is a likely reaction to seasonal growth in demand. The second suggests that OPEC+ is striving to lower oil prices in order to ""punish"" its own participants for breaching the agreement, notably Kazakhstan, which continues to exceed its production quota. The third version is the group's attempt to regain its market share through growing production, having pushed US shale oil producers off the market by reducing prices.

 

The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) has begun developing the CIS Plus platform, the organization told Izvestia. Countries can join the new format either as partners or observers. For example, members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) may join individually or the entire organization collectively. The sides have promising areas for cooperation: economic, humanitarian, as well as the security sphere, experts emphasize. The role of international organizations and blocs in the Eurasian space has been increasing lately, with the SCO and BRICS attracting more new partners.

""The CIS Plus platform is being developed and is similar to BRICS+ bringing in partners who are not necessarily formal members of the organization. That is, participation in the CIS is possible both via membership and also via partnership or observation,"" Andrey Sazonov, director of the CIS Department for Cooperation in the Political, Humanitarian and Social Spheres, told Izvestia.

The CIS and SCO have many points of intersection. For example, for both organizations, fighting terrorism and curbing drug trafficking is important, Belarusian political scientist Alexey Dzermant told the newspaper.

""So, such countries as Pakistan, India, and Iran could also benefit from the CIS Plus format,"" he said.

The organizations can also collaborate on resolving humanitarian and cultural issues. For instance, for China, one of the SCO's leaders, such integration would be beneficial, and initiatives along the CIS lines could be continued there, the expert believes.

Expanding cooperation between the organizations also benefits Moscow, particularly amid the West's ongoing attempts to isolate it.

The organization's new formats are becoming increasingly popular, while participation in them enhances the countries' status which is one of the reasons many nations are eager for such cooperation, expert at the Valdai Discussion Club Andrey Kortunov said.

""The majority of these formats do not involve any strict obligations for members. That is, unlike classic integration projects or military-political alliances, these new-generation multilateral groups are extremely flexible. One could say that so far, the ‘entry ticket' to these structures is cost-free. This is also their advantage, something that makes them attractive,"" the expert concluded.

MOSCOW, June 10. /TASS/. The change of power in Syria, conflicts in the Gaza Strip and constant pressure on Iran are fueling the escalation of Islamic radicalism worldwide, Alexander Bortnikov, head of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), said.

""The change of power in Syria, the Gaza Strip conflict, constant pressure on Iran and the escalation of the situation in Libya are contributing to the spread of Islamic radicalism across the globe. Against this backdrop, the activity of ISIS (the Islamic State, IS, banned in Russia - TASS) and its branches in Afghanistan has intensified. The risks of the Islamic State's growing influence in Syria have emerged,"" he stated in a welcoming address to participants in the 18th meeting of department chiefs responsible for counterterrorism efforts at CIS security agencies, which is taking place in Moscow in the year of the 25th anniversary of the CIS Anti-Terrorism Center (ATC).

The FSB chief noted the threats to CIS security caused by mounting instability in the Middle East, Africa, the Afghan-Pakistani zone and Central Asia.

""This is mainly driven by the West's intensified push to retain its geopolitical status, including the use of terrorist groups, and its ongoing neo-colonial policy. The leading role in this belongs to the Anglo-Saxon powers,"" Bortnikov emphasized.

According to him, the ringleaders of international terrorist organizations are banking on the militants active in Afghanistan and Syria, as well as on the terrorists from among Russian, Central Asian and South Caucasus natives released from Syrian jails who are ""already openly announcing their aggressive plans with regard to their countries of origin.""","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

US president's son posted photo ‘mocking the current unrest' in LA by referring to ‘Rooftop Korean' from 1992 riots

An association of Korean Americans in Los Angeles has criticised Donald Trump Jr, the son of the US president, for “reckless” comments on social media and urged him not to exploit a riot that devastated their community 33 years ago.

The Korean American Federation of Los Angeles also said an operation by the US administration to round up suspected undocumented immigrants lacked “due legal procedures”.

Trump Jr posted a photograph of a man with a rifle on a rooftop on X with a message: “Make Rooftop Koreans Great Again!” referring to actions by the Korean American community during the 1992 race riots in Los Angeles.

The federation in separate statements expressed concern over the developments in Los Angeles over the last week and said their businesses were seriously affected by the crackdown and arrests.

“While the unrest has not yet subsided, Donald Trump Jr … showed the recklessness of posting a post on X on Sunday, June 8, mocking the current unrest by mentioning the ‘Rooftop Korean' from the LA riots 33 years ago,” it said in a statement on Monday.

“As the eldest son of the current president and an influencer with approximately 15 million followers, his actions could pose a huge risk in these icy times, and we strongly urge the past trauma of the Korean people be never, ever exploited for any purpose.”

In 1992, some members of the community, armed with firearms, took up positions on store rooftops and reportedly fired on looters, giving rise to the “Rooftop Koreans” folklore.

They had taken their defence into their own hands after they felt official law enforcement was not protecting them from unrest following the police beating of a black motorist, Rodney King.

Hyungwon Kang, a photojournalist who reported for the Los Angeles Times during the 1992 unrest, said on X, in a reply to Trump Jr's post, the picture had been taken by him and it was used without his permission.

“You're using the photo out of context. Please take it down,” Kang said.

Kang told Reuters by email his photograph depicted a different situation when law enforcers were not providing adequate protection.

“(The) current situation of people expressing a widespread disagreement about an excessive and aggressive enforcement by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, while LAPD is present and keeping the city in order is not even remotely similar to the dire situation for Korean Americans of those dark hours during the 1992 LA Riots,” he said.

Kang said he was consulting a lawyer after having no response to his request that Trump Jr take down the post.

This blog is now closed. You can read our report here: 10 people killed in school shooting in Austria

Nine people have been killed in a school shooting in Graz by a 21-year-old former student, who then killed himself, it was confirmed (15:32).

The suspected shooter was an Austrian citizen who lived in Graz, and likely owned weapons legally, with no previous criminal record (15:36). He attended the school in the past, but did not graduate.

12 further people are injured, “some seriously,” Austria's interior minister Gerhard Karner said (15:32), confirming earlier reports from emergency services (14:16).

Austria will hold a nationwide minute of silence on Wednesday, 10am, and observe three days of national mourning, the country's chancellor Christian Stocker said, who called the attack “a national tragedy” (15:24).

… and that's all from me, Jakub Krupa, for today.

The Austrian football champions, SK Sturm Graz, have asked their fans to come to the club's Messendorf training ground on Wednesday to donate blood and help with the emergency response after today's shooting.

On its website, the club said the blood donation centre, run by the Styrian Red Cross, will be open between 3pm and 8pm.

As a thank you, all fans will have a chance to have their picture taken with the Austrian championship trophy.

A vigil will be held at the Graz Cathedral this evening, starting 7pm local time, Austrian media reported.

There will be also additional services for the victims and their families at other churches.

The school where the shooting took place will remain closed until further notice, Austrian education minister Christoph Wiederkehr confirmed.

The European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has also offered her condolences to Austria and the victims of the Graz attack.

Speaking in German to media in Brussels, she said the news had hit her hard and that she grieved with Austria.

“The deaths of innocent children is the worst thing that a family or community can go through. And all my thoughts are with the families, who have lost loved ones, with those who have been injured, their friends and families. Schools are symbols of hope for the future and our young people and it's incredibly difficult to understand how this can happen when we see violence and death in schools.”

It was notable that politicians speaking at this press conference were visibly moved by what happened.

The Austrian media say it is the worst shooting in the country's history.

Nine people have been killed in a school shooting in Graz by a 21-year-old former student, who then killed himself, it was confirmed (15:32).

The suspected shooter was an Austrian citizen who lived in Graz, and likely owned weapons legally, with no previous criminal record (15:36). He attended the school in the past, but did not graduate.

Austria will hold a nationwide minute of silence on Wednesday, 10am, and observe three days of national mourning, the country's chancellor Christian Stocker said, who called the attack “a national tragedy” (15:24).

Asked for more details in the Q&A, the police officers say the suspected shooter had no previous criminal record.

He shot himself after the incident and died on scene, they confirm.

Interior minister Karner gets asked about the background of the perpetrator, and he confirms he was a former student at the school who did not graduate from it.

“Everything else, and many things have been speculated about at this point in time, is simply speculation,” he says, adding it's all now part of an active investigation.

Chancellor Stocker was earlier asked about the details of the national mourning period, and he says “no one in the republic is in a mood to celebrate anything.”

Updating on the state of the investigation, a police spokesperson said the suspect was a 21-year-old Austrian national, who used two weapons that he likely possessed legally.

No information can be given on the likely motive at this stage.

Around 300 police officers responded to the initial alert, with counter-terrorist officers also deployed to the scene.

Interior minister Gerhard Karner has just said there were six female and three male victims of the shooting, with twelve injured, “some seriously,” confirming earlier reports.

He also confirmed there was only one shooter, who is also dead.

State governor Mario Kunasek followed Stocker in paying tribute to all affected, confirming plans to cancel all public events planned for the next three days.

Austrian interior minister Gerhard Karner is next to speak.

Austrian chancellor Christian Stocker said today marked “a dark day in the history of our country,” calling the school shooting in Graz “a national tragedy that deeply shocked us all.”

He expressed his sympathies to all affected, saying it left him “speechless” that a school, meant to be a safe space for all, was “shaken by such an act of violence.”

He confirmed plans to hold a national minute of silence at 10am on Wednesday, followed by three days of national mourning.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Taiwanese miniature artist Chen Forng-shean (陳逢顯) sculpted the world's smallest goldfish made of gold, measuring 3mm.

The sculpture, titled Suspended Realm (懸浮之境), depicts a miniature goldfish swimming inside a stream of water flowing from a floating golden faucet.

That sculpture captures a unique artistic vision, as the goldfish yearns for freedom amid a rushing current, Chen said.

The piece took 30 days to finish and is the world's smallest goldfish sculpted from gold, Chen said.

Compared with his previous creations, which include the world's smallest teapot and ant sculpture, making a miniature out of gold is more challenging, he said.

Gold is soft and highly reflective, so crafting the goldfish's tiny body, fins, head, large eyes and open mouth required working with customized tools under a microscope, repeatedly refining the details, Chen said.

One small mistake could have ruined the entire piece, he said.

Chen had to precisely calculate the center of gravity and support points for the floating faucet and water stream to achieve the visual effect of the goldfish being held by the water, he said.

The sculpture not only showcases exquisite craftsmanship and artistic prowess, but carries deep symbolic meaning for Chen, who said it blends artistic expression with philosophical thought.

The faucet represents human control, while the goldfish swimming against the current symbolizes a longing for freedom, he added.

An art critic said that it captures the flow of life within a tiny space, representing a perfect collision of science and aesthetics.

The sculpture is on display at the Chen Forng-shean Miniature Art Museum along with many of his other creations.

Chen said he plans to tackle “dynamic miniature sculptures,” using the medium to show dynamic aesthetics within avant-garde artistic structures.

The climate-related lawsuit — the first of its kind in Taiwan — sought to require the government to enforce higher green energy thresholds on major corporations to reduce emissions in light of climate change and an uptick in extreme weather.

The revamped FIFA Club World Cup starting on Saturday brings together some of the most celebrated teams and players in global soccer ... and Auckland City. In a tournament boasting US$1 billion in prize money and featuring superstar multi-millionaire players including Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe, the New Zealand side are a striking anomaly. 

Auckland City are an amateur club, their players balancing soccer with university studies or full-time jobs as teachers, real-estate agents and sales representatives. They do not earn a salary for playing. 

Their first game at the Club World Cup in the US brings them face-to-face with German champions Bayern Munich and their prolific England striker Harry Kane.

Benfica and Boca Juniors, two other storied heavyweights, come next. 

Auckland City striker Angus Kilkolly cannot wait. 

“It's probably our dream group,” he told said as he made his way to training from his day job in sales. “For us to be able to experience playing against those teams is a dream for us. To be actually on the same pitch is a little bit crazy.” 

The 13-time Oceania Champions League winners have been an almost constant presence at the Club World Cup since 2006. 

The Navy Blues finished third of seven sides at the 2014 edition, beaten by Argentina's San Lorenzo in extra time in the semi-finals. 

The tournament this time is a different beast after FIFA pumped in huge resources and made it a 32-team competition that includes Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City and Inter. 

Kilkolly describes Auckland City as “a family club where everyone's welcome, you know everyone, you see the same people at every game.” 

Their picturesque Kiwitea Street ground is nestled in a residential area in New Zealand's biggest city, and matches typically take place in front of crowds of 200 to 2,000, Kilkolly said. 

“We've got a nice boutique club room, and everybody enjoys a drink after the game,” said the 29-year-old, who averages a goal every other game in his nearly 140 appearances for the club. 

Auckland City are currently second, a point behind leaders Birkenhead United AFC in the amateur 12-team Northern League. 

So, against the highest level of opposition they have ever faced, what would represent success against Bayern and the rest? 

“If we can leave there and say: ‘We played our style, we've done our best,' I think that's a positive outlook,” Kilkolly said. “If we leave there with regrets, going: ‘We didn't do all we could,' that would be a sour feeling.” 

The team would stick to the club's “DNA” of attractive, possession-based soccer and playing out from the back, he said. 

“We don't concede a lot of goals in New Zealand, so obviously we're aiming not to concede too many goals at the Club World Cup as well,” he said. 

Kilkolly's typical week day is a busy one, and he has not taken a proper holiday for three or four years, because soccer eats up all his leave days. 

A manager in sales for a power tools firm, he is in the office at 7:30am, does a day's work, trains three or four times a week, home by 9pm, off to bed, repeat. 

He does not receive a wage for playing soccer. 

Rather, there is a cap of NZ$150 (US$91) a week for amateur soccer players in the country covering basic expenses such as gym membership. 

The Auckland City players are to be in the US for about a month — thankfully Kilkolly's boss is understanding and likes soccer. 

“It's not easy, it's four weeks' leave, but I don't have four weeks' annual leave, so there's unpaid leave going there,” Kilkolly said. “But it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Playing at the World Cup gives us the ability to compete on a world stage and have that feeling of being a professional footballer, without being one.” 

As a forward, Kilkolly would have eyes on Kane's No. 9 jersey after their game at the 26,000-capacity TQL Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio. 

“I think he earns more in a week than I earn in a year working,” he said with a laugh.



                                                                                Spain starlets Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams dazzled on Thursday as La Roja beat France 5-4 in a thriller in Stuttgart, Germany, to set up a UEFA Nations League final with Portugal.
Yamal bagged a brace, while Williams scored and provided an assist as the two wingers cut France's makeshift defense to ribbons.
Mikel Merino and Pedri were also on the score sheet for the UEFA Euro 2024 champions. Kylian Mbappe netted a second-half penalty, but Spain were 5-1 up and cruising, before Les Bleus suddenly woke up as their opponents took their foot off the pedal.

UNITED KINGDOM

Trade talks continue

US and Chinese officials yesterday were set to meet for a second day of trade talks in London, seeking to shore up a shaky tariff truce in a spat further strained by export curbs. The gathering of key officials from the world's two biggest economies began on Monday at Lancaster House following an earlier round of talks in Geneva, Switzerland, last month. A source familiar with negotiations said that talks wrapped up on Monday evening and were expected to restart at 10am yesterday. The London meeting came after Washington accused Beijing of contravening the Geneva deal to de-escalate staggeringly high tariffs. A key sticking point was the export of rare earths from China. “In Geneva, we had agreed to lower tariffs on them, and they had agreed to release the magnets and rare earths that we need throughout the economy,” US National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Monday. Even though Beijing was releasing some supplies, “it was going a lot slower than some companies believed was optimal,” he added.

SOUTH KOREA

Two BTS stars end service

Two members of K-pop group BTS were released from South Korea's mandatory military service yesterday and announced they wanted to start performing again “as soon as possible,” prompting a fan frenzy. BTS, South Korea's most lucrative musical act, has been on a hiatus since 2022 while its seven members complete their military service. Hundreds of fans gathered at a site near the two army bases where band leader RM and singer V were separately discharged. Cheers broke out as they stepped out of different vehicles and hugged, with RM playing a quick song on the saxophone as V stood next to him smiling, holding bunches of flowers. “What we want most right now is to perform again,” RM, still wearing his army uniform, told reporters and fans after his discharge. “We're working hard on the new album so we can return to the stage as soon as possible.” RM said there had been “many difficult and painful moments” during his 18 months of military service.

Sly Stone dies aged 82

Funk master and innovator Sly Stone, whose music drove a civil rights-inflected soul explosion in the 1960s, sparking influential albums, but also a slide into drug addiction, has died, his family said on Monday. He was 82. The frontman for Sly and the Family Stone — rock's first racially integrated, mixed-gender lineup — “passed away peacefully, surrounded by his three children, his closest friend and his extended family,” after a prolonged battle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other health issues, his family said in a statement. “While we mourn his absence, we take solace in knowing that his extraordinary musical legacy will continue to resonate and inspire for generations to come,” it said. With his vibrant on-stage energy, killer hooks and lyrics that often decried prejudice, Stone became a superstar, releasing pivotal records that straddled musical genres and performing a set that enraptured the crowd at Woodstock, but he retreated to the shadows in the early 1970s and his personal struggles ultimately led to the group's disintegration. He emerged sporadically for unfulfilling concert tours, erratic TV appearances and a flopped 2006 reunion on the Grammy Awards stage. For many, Stone was a musical genius creating the sound of the future. It was “like seeing a black version of the Beatles,” funk legend George Clinton told CBS News of his longtime friend's stage presence.

Joyous cricket fans had come out to celebrate and welcome home their heroes, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, after they beat Punjab Kings in a roller-coaster Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket final on Tuesday night.

The agreement, reached in 2022 and ratified by Kosovar lawmakers last year, provides for the reception of up to 300 foreign prisoners sentenced in Denmark. They must not have been convicted of terrorism or war crimes, or have a mental condition or terminal disease. Once their sentence is completed in Kosovan, they would be deported to their home country.

The census indicated that Brazil had 100.2 million Roman Catholics in 2022, accounting for 56.7 percent of the population, down from 65.1 percent or 105.4 million recorded in the 2010 census.
Meanwhile, the share of evangelical Christians rose to 26.9 percent last year, up from 21.6 percent in 2010, adding 12 million followers to reach 47.4 million — the highest figure

Tokyo, June 9 (Jiji Press)—Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda on Monday agreed to work together to maintain and strengthen the free and open international order based on the rule of law.

During their meeting at the prime minister's office in Tokyo, Ishiba brought up the late Japanese diplomat Chiune Sugihara, who helped thousands of Jewish refugees flee the Nazis by issuing visas while stationed in Lithuania during World War II.

Japan and Lithuania are connected by a warm and strong bond, Ishiba said, expressing an eagerness to cooperate to maintain peace and stability in the international community.

Saying that the two countries are like-minded nations, Nauseda vowed to work on furthering bilateral ties.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Kyiv and Odesa came under another mass Russian attack in the early hours of June 10, involving ballistic missiles and drones. Explosions were heard across the capital as air defense systems engaged the targets.

A woman was killed and four other people were injured in Kyiv, according to local authorities. Meanwhile, in the southern city of Odesa, two men were killed and at least eight civilians were wounded in the attack. One more person suffered shock during the attack on Odesa, authorities reported.

According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, the attack was one of the largest on Kyiv during the full-scale war.

""Russian missile and Shahed strikes drown out the efforts of the United States and others around the world to force Russia into peace,"" he wrote on X. 

""For yet another night, instead of a ceasefire, there were massive strikes with Shahed drones, cruise and ballistic missiles.""

Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground reported the sounds of drones and multiple explosions throughout the capital.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported that cars were on fire in the Shevchenkivskyi district, while drone debris fell on the grounds of a school in the Obolonskyi district. Emergency services were dispatched to the sites of attack, and medics were also called to the Podilskyi and Darnytskyi districts.

Later in the day, Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said that a woman was killed in the Obolonskyi district.

In the Dniprovskyi district, smoke was seen coming from non-residential buildings, and a fire broke out at a non-residential site in the Obolonskyi district.

""A residential building is on fire in the Shevchenkivskyi district. A woman is injured and is being treated,"" Tkachenko said at 3:10 a.m. local time. 

Klitschko added that another injured person in the Darnytskyi district was treated on the spot by medics, while the third victim was hospitalized in the Obolonskyi district of the city. Kyiv's mayor reported at 5:58 a.m. that a fourth person was hospitalized as a result of the Russian attack on the capital.

Speaking to the Kyiv Independent, Kyiv resident Elvira Nechyporenko said she was in her apartment when she heard the explosions.

""I (was) away from the window. I moved to another wall. And it was clear that the building was hit,"" she said.

""There are no such words, no emotions. I just want to forget about their (Russia's) existence. I want them to simply not exist. Neither as a nation nor as a state. And not to remember that we have such neighbors.""

The Russian attack smashed the windows in Viktoriia Nykyshyna's apartment while she was sheltering with her cat in the stairwell.

""We heard everything, how (the fire) was put out. We lived it all here,"" she said. ""We are still holding on. We haven't fully realized what happened.""

According to Culture Minister Mykola Tochytskyi, the strike also damaged St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv. The UNESCO World Heritage site, dating back to the 11th century, is one of Ukraine's most significant religious and cultural landmarks.

""Tonight, (Russia) struck again at the very heart of our identity,"" Tochytskyi wrote on Facebook. ""St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, a centuries-old shrine symbolizing the birth of our statehood, has been damaged.""

The management of St. Sophia Cathedral has informed UNESCO about the damage caused to the historic site by a recent Russian airstrike, according to the reserve's general director, Nelia Kukovalska. Speaking to Suspilne, she said that the blast wave damaged the cornice of the cathedral's central apse. 

Russia launched 315 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys against Ukraine overnight, as well as two North Korean KN-23 ballistic missiles and five Iskander-K cruise missiles, primarily targeting Kyiv, the Air Force reported.

Ukrainian air defenses shot down all seven missiles and 213 attack drones. According to the statement, 64 drones disappeared from radars or were intercepted by electronic warfare systems.

In Odesa, a film studio and medical facilities, including a maternity hospital, were damaged.

""The administrative building of an emergency medical station was also completely destroyed. There is a fire at the scene. Ambulances are damaged. There are no injuries among the personnel,"" Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said at 3:40 a.m. local time. 

A Russian attack caused damage to a maternity hospital in Odesa. At the time of the attack, 85 adults and 22 children were inside, but no staff or patients were injured as everyone was in the shelter, facility director Iryna Golovatyuk-Yuzefpolskaya told Suspilne. 

Odesa is located approximately 442 kilometers (274 miles) from the capital. 

The renewed assault comes just a day after Russia launched a record 499 aerial weapons against Ukraine, including 479 Shahed-type attack drones, decoy drones, four Kh-47M2 Kinzhal ballistic missiles, 10 Kh-101 cruise missiles, three Kh-22 cruise missiles over the Black Sea, two Kh-31P anti-radar missiles, and one Kh-35 cruise missile from occupied Crimea. 

Ukraine reported it had neutralized 479 of those targets — 292 were shot down and 187 were disrupted through electronic warfare on June 9.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha urged the immediate implementation of new, strong sanctions against Moscow after the large-scale air strikes.

""Russia rejects any meaningful peace efforts and must face new, devastating sanctions. Already now. There is no more time to wait,"" the minister wrote on X on June 10.

Sybiha pointed out that the priority areas for the sanctions include Russian banks, a reduction in the gas price cap established by the G7, and secondary sanctions against those who assist Russia in evading restrictions.

""These sanctions are not just intended to support Ukraine. They are essential to our partners. Such economic restrictions defund Russia's war machine, which is directed not only at us, but also at them,"" he added. 

Kyiv has repeatedly urged Russia to accept a Western-backed 30-day ceasefire as the first step toward a broader peace deal — a move that Moscow again rejected during a recent round of negotiations in Istanbul on June 2.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has questioned Russia's ability to attack NATO countries, as it is not ""even capable of defeating Ukraine,"" he said in an interview with French TV channel LCI on June 8.

""The Russians are too weak for that,"" Orban said. ""They're not even capable of defeating Ukraine, so they're incapable of really attacking NATO.""

Over three years into its full-scale war, Russia has failed to achieve Ukraine's surrender or at least the complete occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, which was reportedly among the Kremlin's demands in Russia's first peace proposal in 2022.

Russian troops have recently intensified their offensive, moving deeper into Sumy Oblast, as well as closing in on Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.

Russian propaganda has for years insisted that NATO and its further expansion pose a threat to Moscow. The Kremlin has also claimed that Ukraine's ambition to join NATO was a major trigger for its invasion, although in 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea and started the war in the Donbas region, Ukraine's chances and desires of joining the alliance were low.

Orban, widely regarded as the European Union's most pro-Russian leader, said that it is not in the interests of the EU, including Hungary, to have ""a direct conflict with Russia"" or ""a threat of war,"" so Ukraine must not join NATO.

""Europe must be strengthened in the long term, and there must be a strategic agreement with Russia,"" Orban said, adding that sanctions against Russia are ""destroying Hungary and the whole of Europe.""

Under the Orban regime, Hungary has become widely regarded as the most Kremlin-friendly state in the EU.

Budapest has been blocking the opening of EU accession negotiation clusters with Kyiv and signaled further obstruction in recent weeks after Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) said it had uncovered a Hungarian spy network in western Ukraine.

Orban also encouraged Hungarians to vote in a non-binding national poll on Ukraine's EU bid that the government launched in early March. The poll has garnered criticism for low turnout and manipulative questions, written to encourage citizens to reject Ukraine's accession.

Errol Musk, the father of U.S. billionaire Elon Musk, has arrived in Moscow to attend the Forum of the Future 2050, a pro-Kremlin event scheduled for June 9-10,  the Russian newspaper Kommersant reported on June 8. 

The report comes amid a high-profile public conflict between Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest businessman, and his former ally, U.S. President Donald Trump. In May, Musk announced he would step down as an advisor to Trump and as the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Since then, he has emerged as a major critic of the president.

The pro-Kremlin event will be hosted by the Tsargrad Institute and led by far-right Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin. 

""I am eager to meet everyone. As far as I know, Russians are among the most intelligent people on the planet. It would be foolish not to ask their opinion on all sorts of issues,"" Errol Musk was quoted as saying by the Russian state news agency TASS.

Among the forum's panels are sessions titled ""Russian Space: The Race for Mars"" and ""The Battle for Hearts and Minds: The Ideology of Sovereign Russia."" 

According to Kommersant, scheduled speakers include Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, oligarch Konstantin Malofeev, and prominent state TV anchor Ekaterina Andreeva.

Errol Musk, a former South African businessman and politician, has publicly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him ""a strong leader"" and saying that ""it would be foolish not to admire Putin"" in an April interview with BBC Russia.  

Errol's attendance at the far-right event comes amid growing scrutiny of his son, Elon Musk, whose role as the head of SpaceX and the Starlink satellite network places him at the center of both U.S. defense operations and Ukraine's battlefield communications.

SpaceX holds billions in Pentagon and NASA contracts, including a $1.8-billion agreement with the U.S. intelligence community to build a classified spy satellite system.

Despite initially aiding Ukraine by providing Starlink terminals to stabilize battlefield communications, Elon Musk has increasingly echoed Kremlin-aligned narratives. 

He has suggested that President Volodymyr Zelensky lacks public support in Ukraine and has repeatedly called U.S. aid a driver of a ""never-ending draft meat grinder.""

Those statements have been warmly received by Russian officials, military bloggers, and state media outlets, which have praised Musk as a voice of reason and a critic of Western involvement in the war.

Dmitry Novikov, deputy chairman of the Russian parliament's international affairs committee, said on June 6 that Moscow is ready to grant political asylum to Musk following his public dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Israel deported activist Greta Thunberg on Tuesday, the country's Foreign Ministry said, a day after the Gaza-bound ship she was on was seized by the Israeli military.

Speaking upon arrival in Paris en route to her home country of Sweden, Thunberg called for the release of the other activists who were detained aboard the Freedom Flotilla. She described a “quite chaotic and uncertain” situation during the detention.

The conditions they faced “are absolutely nothing compared to what people are going through in Palestine and especially Gaza right now,” she said. The trip was meant to protest Israeli restrictions on aid to Gaza's population of over two million people after 20 months of war, according to the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, the group behind the journey.

Activist Greta Thunberg arrived in Paris after being deported from Israel on Tuesday and called for more actions to support aid efforts for Gaza.

The Associated Press

“We were well aware of the risks of this mission,” Thunberg said. “The aim was to get to Gaza and to be able to distribute the aid.” She said the activists would continue trying to get aid to Gaza.

On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump called Thunberg “a young angry person” and recommended she take anger management classes.

“I think the world need a lot more young angry women,” Thunberg said Tuesday in response.

Thunberg said it appeared she was headed back to Sweden, hadn't had access to a phone in a few days and wanted a shower. The activists were held separately and some had trouble accessing lawyers, she added.

Asked why she agreed to deportation, she said, “Why would I want to stay in an Israeli prison more than necessary?”

Thunberg called on supporters to ask their governments to mobilize “to demand not only humanitarian aid being let into Gaza but most importantly an end to the occupation and an end to the systemic oppression and violence that Palestinians are facing on an everyday basis.”

She said recognizing Palestine is “the very, very, very minimum” that governments can do to help.

Thunberg was one of 12 passengers on the Madleen. Israeli naval forces seized the boat without incident early Monday about 200 kilometres off Gaza.

Explainer: What is the new U.S.-backed Gaza aid plan and why doesn't the UN like it?

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, along with rights groups, said Israel's actions in international waters were a violation of international law. Israel rejects that charge, saying such ships intend to breach what it argues is a lawful naval blockade of Gaza.

Israel viewed the ship as a publicity stunt, calling it the “selfie yacht” with a “meagre” amount of aid that amounted to less than a truckload.

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition said three activists, including Thunberg, had been deported along with a journalist. It said it had encouraged some of the group to do this so they could speak freely about their experiences.

Israel commits ‘extermination' in Gaza by killing civilians sheltering in schools, UN experts say

Eight other passengers refused deportation and were being held in detention before their case is to be heard by Israeli authorities. Adalah, a legal rights group in Israel representing the activists, said the eight were expected to be brought before a court later Tuesday.

“Their detention is unlawful, politically motivated and a direct violation of international law,” the coalition said in a statement. It called for the remaining passengers to be released without deportation and said their lawyers would demand that they be allowed to complete their journey to Gaza.

Sabine Haddad, a spokeswoman for Israel's Interior Ministry, said the activists who were being deported Tuesday had waived their right to appear before a judge. Those who did not will face one and will be held for 96 hours before being deported, she said.

Palestinians say Israeli forces fired toward crowds near Gaza aid site, killing at least three

Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament who is of Palestinian descent, was also among the passengers on board the Madleen. She has previously been barred from entering Israel because of her opposition to Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. It was not clear whether she was being immediately deported or detained.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said Tuesday that one of the detained French activists signed an expulsion order and will leave Israel on Tuesday for France. The other five refused. He said all the activists received consular visits.

Sergio Toribio, a Spanish activist who was deported, slammed Israel's actions after he arrived in Barcelona.

“It is unforgivable, it is a violation of our rights. It is a pirate attack in international waters,” he told reporters.

A charity vessel aiming to deliver aid and raise awareness of the Gaza crisis was seized by Israeli naval forces at sea on Monday. The boat, whose crew includes climate activist Greta Thunberg, is headed to an Israeli port after failing to breach the long-held naval blockade stopping access to the Gaza Strip.

U.S. President Donald Trump plans to speak at Fort Bragg on Tuesday to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army as he deploys the military in an attempt to quiet immigration protests in Los Angeles.

Fort Bragg, located near Fayetteville, N.C., serves as headquarters for U.S. Army Special Operations Command. Highly trained units like the Green Berets and the Rangers are based there.

Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll will also be at Tuesday's event, along with service members, veterans and their families.

Trump has promoted the Army's anniversary as a reason to hold a military parade in Washington on Saturday, which is also his 79th birthday. Tanks and other vehicles will roll down city streets in a reminder of how the Republican president is reshaping the armed forces after returning to the White House this year.

Trump, who sees the military as a critical tool for domestic goals, has used the recent protests in Los Angeles as an opportunity to deploy the National Guard and U.S. Marines to quell disturbances that began as protests over immigration raids.

Trump has authorized the deployment of 4,000 National Guard soldiers to the city over the objections of Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom. About 700 Marines were also due to formally deploy to Los Angeles.

Opinion: For Trump, the L.A. protests are an opportunity to wield power and spread fear

California sued Trump over the deployment, with the state attorney-general arguing that the President had “trampled” the state's sovereignty. California leaders accused Trump of fanning protesters' anger, leading crowds to block off a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire.

“We're gonna have troops everywhere,” Trump said over the weekend. “We're not going to let this happen to our country.”

Fort Bragg has been in the middle of a cultural tug-of-war over the military. It was named after a Confederate general, then renamed to Fort Liberty two years ago.

Hegseth brought back the Bragg name but said it was being used to honor an Army paratrooper who served in the Second World War.

The Trump administration on Monday ordered U.S. Marines into Los Angeles. The move marks another escalation in President Donald Trump's response to street protests over his aggressive immigration policies.

Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum will be attending the G7 summit in Alberta next week.Marco Ugarte/The Associated Press

On Monday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum finally agreed to attend the G7 summit next week in Kananaskis, Alta., almost six weeks after Prime Minister Mark Carney invited her, and after she'd brusquely declared she was only “thinking about” attending. She accepted, she declared, because it was a chance to meet President Donald Trump.

That deliberately cold shoulder – as it was viewed in both Mexico City and Ottawa – is a public manifestation of something that officials in both countries have known for more than a year: High-level relations between Canada and Mexico are poisoned. They can hardly even be called relations.

At a moment when Ottawa is scrambling to build closer political, trade and defence ties to other functioning democracies to compensate for the loss of U.S. partnership under Mr. Trump's destructive leadership, Mexico is mostly absent from the conversation. Beyond pro forma gestures such as Mr. Carney's customary invitation and a lone post-election phone call, there has been little in the way of new co-operation between the two governments, despite both sharing a broadly centre-left perspective, sovereignty and tariff threats from Mr. Trump, and of course a three-country free-trade agreement that will soon be up for renegotiation.

In fact, it wasn't trade or politics that shattered this relationship. Well, those played a role, but diplomats agree that the straw that broke the chupacabra's back was the early 2024 decision by Ottawa to reimpose a visa requirement on Mexicans visiting Canada, after eight years of visa-free travel.

“Naturally, it hurt,” said Juan José Gómez Camacho, a former Mexican ambassador to Canada. “Because visas are not just administrative travel documents. Visas, whether intentionally or otherwise, always carry an unavoidable political message, especially when you are talking about two countries that have a very close relationship as trading partners.”

I contacted Mr. Gómez after witnessing an unusually heated panel discussion between Mexican and Canadian diplomats organized recently by the Canadian Council for the Americas. It revealed mutual fixation on the visa issue: The Canadians said they had been trying to tell Mexico about thousands of their citizens who were boarding tourist flights to Canada and then filing refugee claims upon landing (few Mexicans are eligible for asylum in Canada). Ottawa had been asking Mexico's government to do something about it at their end. But Ms. Sheinbaum's predecessor had refused even to take a call from then-prime minister Justin Trudeau.

The Mexicans, for their part, said the problem was partly Canada's: Our booming construction industry is chronically short of skilled trades and labourers, and in the absence of accessible legal immigration routes, contractors were actively recruiting undocumented tradespeople, who only knew how to enter Canada by coming as tourists and overstaying. Canada, the Mexicans felt, needed to solve its problem first.

The visas only confirmed a growing distrust. When Mr. Trump angrily cancelled the North American free-trade agreement in his first term, he had first tried to negotiate a new deal alone with Mexico. They refused, insisting Canada be included. But after Mr. Trump's second election in November, a number of Canadians, including Ontario Premier Doug Ford, vocally proposed a Mexico-excluding bilateral deal, which looked to Mexicans like a betrayal of their generosity. And Ottawa has been (rightly) publicly critical of Ms. Sheinbaum's move this month to have hundreds of judges “elected,” effectively turning the country's justice system into a political arm of her party. It may contradict Canada's democratic values, but it looked to some Mexicans like we were interfering with the internal affairs of an ally against the much larger democratic threat from Washington.

The root problem, Mr. Gómez notes, is that for both Canada and Mexico, our economic and political relations with each other come a very distant second – if that – to our very different relationships with the United States. We're both in bed with the elephant, as the saying goes, though one of us has to sleep underneath. In the presence of that huge problem, our mutual distrust can be left to fester.

If it was a seemingly minor migration issue that triggered this impasse, Mr. Gómez suggests, then migration issues may be the best way out of it.

Mr. Carney's “nation-building” agenda – the accelerated construction of millions of homes and transportation and energy infrastructure projects – will require unprecedented numbers of skilled-trades and construction workers, many from abroad. It's an opportunity to forge a migration co-operation agreement with Mexico that could provide the incentives and processes needed to restore visa-free travel. 

The G7, given the elephant in the room, is probably not the place to start mending this rift. But the two heads of government should meet soon, and in person, to restore both human mobility and political cooperation between two countries that have more in common with each other than with the untamed animal lying between them.

A referendum to ease Italian citizenship requirements failed on Monday due to low voter turnout. The result is a victory for Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who encouraged the public not to vote.

Italian citizenship and labor reform referendums look likely to fail due to low voter turnout.

As two-day voting wound down in Europe's fourth-largest economy only about 30% of Italy's 51 million eligible voters had turned out to cast ballots in five referendums championed by center-left opposition groups as well as the country's labor unions.

Referendums require 50% plus one voter participation to be legally binding in Italy.

The result is seen as a major victory for Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who vehemently opposed the measures.

Meloni arrived at a Rome polling station on Sunday — when turnout was 22% — to declare that she would not cast a vote. 

Meloni then once-again encouraged her supporters to likewise boycott the ballot.

Four of the referendums centered on workplace protections including better protections against firing, increased severance pay, unemployment benefits, the end of fixed-term contracts and better workplace accident compensation.

A fifth referendum addressed whether voters wanted to ease citizenship laws in the country, allowing non-EU immigrants to apply for Italian passports after five rather than the current 10 years.

At the moment, the rule would apply to roughly 2.5 million non-EU immigrants.

Arguments for easing citizenship requirements were driven by the demographic fact of Italy's dwindling birth rates and calls for better integrating foreign workers in an effort to boost the country's economy.

Data compiled by the polling organization YouTrend said voter turnout was higher in the country's industrialized north than the agricultural south, as well in cities and in areas where left-leaning parties preformed best in Italy's most recent general and EU elections.

""The opposition wanted to turn this into a referendum on the Meloni government,"" said Cabinet undersecretary and Meloni ally Giovanbattista Fazzolari. ""The response is very clear: The government emerges from this stronger and the opposition weaker.""

Speaking of the vote's failure, YouTrend's Lorenzo Pregliasco said, ""Whether just above 30% or just below, this is a low figure… below the expectations and targets set by the promoters.""

The US military is urging African countries to be more responsible for their own security as the Trump administration focuses on domestic policies. Could the move fuel militant groups and undo counterterrorism progress?

Africa should take greater ownership of its own security challenges. That was the message recently communicated by Gen. Michael Langley, head of US Africa Command (USAFRICOM). The unit is part of the US Department of Defense and is responsible for all Department of Defense operations and security cooperation on the African continent. 

The announcement comes as the United States rethinks its military strategy in Africa, signaling a significant shift in its approach to security on the continent.

This adjustment aligns with a broader strategic pivot under the Trump administration, which is prioritizing homeland security and a leaner, more lethal military force, while reducing the US military footprint overseas, including in Africa.

But what could it mean for the continent?

Africa is strategically important to Europe and the United States for its growing population and vast natural resources.

""Africa is a strategic partner with a large and growing youth population — projected to double by 2045 according to the African Economic Outlook,"" Adib Saani, a foreign policy and security analyst told DW. ""The continent is rich, holding vast mineral resources and strategic reserves like uranium that both Western and Eastern countries heavily rely on."" The continent is also home to 11 of the world's 20 fastest-growing economies in 2024.

""The US and others engage with Africa not just out of goodwill but because these resources are vital for running industries worldwide,"" Saani said. ""This makes the relationship mutually beneficial — a win-win for Africa and the rest of the world.""

However, the Trump administration's defense strategy has shifted focus away from protecting the US from threats emanating from abroad, including countering terrorist organizations such as the ""Islamic State"" (IS) militant group and al-Qaeda, which have expanded their presence and capabilities in Africa.

Previously, US military efforts in Africa combined defense, diplomacy, and development. ""America has been a close partner in countering violent extremism, especially in Eastern and West Africa,” Saani explained. ""We have relied heavily on US logistics, training, and intelligence sharing to address these threats. In terms of human security, the US hasalso contributed through USAID and other programs that have helped lift many out of poverty.""

US Marine Corps Gen. Michael Langley said the military's priorities now focus on homeland protection. He instead encouraged ""burden sharing"" with African partners. He said the goal is to build local military capacity to enable independent operations and reduce reliance on US forces. This shift was evident during the 25th African Lion joint military exercise. The annual event is the largest military exercise on the continent and emphasizes combined air, land and sea operations with more than 40 participating nations. It lacked the US-led efforts usually apparent and instead focused on collaboration and cooperation. 

Yet foreign policy analyst Adib Saani warns that a diminished US presence could create a power vacuum, emboldening militant networks and undermining years of counter-terrorism efforts. ""If the US withdraws its support, it would hit us hard. It could embolden terrorists to carry out more lethal and audacious attacks, knowing there is no major power backing our fight. This would also dampen the morale of our soldiers who face these threats daily, and place significant economic pressure on affected countries.""

USAFRICOM currently deploys roughly 6,500 personnel across Africa and has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in security assistance. With that gone, Saani worries that Africa will not be able to be fully indipendent when it comes to security: ""It will be difficult in terms of logistics and technology — we are simply not there yet. Security is a shared responsibility and works best when it involves multiple actors. In my opinion, Africa cannot do it alone.""

African countries will need to look for other allies – both new and old, say experts. China has already launched extensive military training programs for African forces, replicating aspects of the US military model, while Russian mercenariesestablish themselves as key security partners in North, West, and Central Africa.

""China'sapproach in the past has mainly been economic,"" Saani explained. The US, he points out, has primarily focused on military support, in addition to providing economic help. ""The Russians have strong presence with both economic and military involvement. It feels like everyone is competing for attention. The clear message is that there's a need to diversify partnerships. We can't rely solely on the US; we may also need to engage more with the Russians and others.""

Some voices say that the lack of US support could be a wake-up call for African countries, forcing them to consider their own resources and rise to the challenge.

African nations must now take the opportunity to review their security resources, Saani says, and collaborate more closely. ""Building up our defense industry is also critical. This means developing industrial capacity and enhancing the capabilities of our armed forces,"" adds the analyst. ""We also need to tackle corruption to ensure that funds are not getting lost in people's pockets but are instead used to improve people's lives.""

The Pentagon is deploying some 700 Marines to Los Angeles amid the immigration protests, officials told the media. LA Governor Newsam meanwhile vowed to sue the Trump administration over the National Guard deployment.

This blog has now closed. Read a round-up of developments in the US on Monday, June 9 below. Please move over to Tuesday's blog for fresh updates.

The state of California has sued the Trump administration for deploying the National Guard in response to the immigration protests in Los Angeles.

According to the lawsuit, the deployment of troops in the state ""trampled"" on the state's sovereignty, with California pushing for a restraining order.

California attorney general Rob Bonta said the move became necessary once US President Trump escalated the number of troops, leading to growing unrest.

In a post on his X account, California governor Gavin Newsom said a government should be ""accountable to its people… not military rule.""

""California will be standing up for those principles in court,"" he added.

California governor Gavin Newsom said the Donald Trump administration will deploy an additional 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in light of the protests in the city.

Sean Parnell, assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs, later confirmed the deployment in a statement on X, saying that Trump had ordered that the toops be ""called into federal service to support ICE & to enable federal law-enforcement officers to safely conduct their duties.""

Newsom was highly critical of the deployment.

""This isn't about public safety, It's about stroking a dangerous President's ego,"" Newsom posted on his X account, calling the move ""reckless, pointless and disrespectful to our troops.""

According to Newsom, only approximately 300 of the first 2,000 National Guard troops to be deployed to Los Angeles are currently active in the city, with the rest ""sitting, unused, in federal buildings without orders.""


US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has fired all members of a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) panel of vaccine experts, the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement.

Kennedy removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a body that advises the CDC on which groups of people would most benefit from an already-approved vaccine and the timing in which they should get it. 

The process of considering new members to replace the departing members has begun, the statement said.

Kennedy Jr., a long-time vaccine skeptic, said the move is to restore public trust ""above any specific pro- or anti-vaccine agenda,"" adding that ""unbiased science"" is what guides US health agencies.

Former FDA Chief Scientist Jesse Goodman called the firings a ""tragedy,"" saying the move will reduce confidence in the US' health authorities.

Protesters against the detention of migrants have gathered in Los Angeles for a fourth day in a row.

The Los Angeles Police Department said protesters were blocking several roads across the city, announcing the closure of some roads.

This comes after the Donald Trump administration ordered the deployment of some 700 Marines in light of the ongoing protests in the city.

The US will deploy some 700 Marines to help the authorities' response to the immigration protests in Los Angeles, the US Northern Command said on Monday.

""The activation of the Marines is intended to provide Task Force 51 with adequate numbers of forces to provide continuous coverage of the area in support of the lead federal agency,"" the Command said in a statement.

A senior source in the Donald Trump administration earlier told the French AFP news agency that the deployment is due to the ""increased threats against federal officers and federal buildings.""

California governor Gavin Newsom condemned the deployment of Marines on American soil, saying Marines should not be deployed ""to fulfill the deranged fantasy"" of Trump, on his X account.

The United Nations has weighed in on the police response to protesters in California.

It called on all levels of government, including state and federal authorities, to prevent ""further militarization"" amid the unrest.

""We do not want to see any further militarization of this situation, and we encourage the parties at the local, state and federal levels to work to do that,"" said UN spokesperson Farhan Haq.

US President Donald Trump claimed it was necessary to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in a post on his Truth social network on Monday.

""We made a great decision in sending the National Guard to deal with the violent, instigated riots in California,"" Trump wrote.

""If we had not done so, Los Angeles would have been completely obliterated. The very incompetent 'Governor,' Gavin Newscum [sic], and 'Mayor,' Karen Bass, should be saying, 'THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU ARE SO WONDERFUL. WE WOULD BE NOTHING WITHOUT YOU, SIR'.""

A day earlier, California's Governor Gavin Newsom announced the state would sue the Trump administration over the move.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has condemned the violence during protests in Los Angeles against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

""It must be clear, we condemn violence wherever it comes from,"" Sheinbaum said during a press conference.

Some protesters, carrying Mexican flags and signs denouncing US immigration authorities, participated in the demonstrations over the past few days. 

Sheinbaum also urged respect for migrant ""dignity.""

Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente said at least 42 Mexicans were being held after the controversial Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Los Angeles.

He added that the vast majority of Mexicans detained were working when they were arrested.

The City of Glendale in Los Angeles County has canceled a contract that allowed Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to house detainees in its local jail.

""The City recognizes that public perception of the ICE contract, no matter how limited or carefully managed, no matter the good, has become divisive,"" it said in a statement late Sunday.

ICE's agreement with Glendale has been in place since 2007.

Even before the recent anti-ICE protests, the city faced criticism from community members and activists who argued that the collaboration violated California's sanctuary laws.

California is a sanctuary state, meaning state and local law enforcement agencies are barred from assisting federal civil immigration officers.

US President Donald Trump has sent National Guard troops to Los Angeles against the will of the California state government. But Governor Gavin Newsom sees it as an alarming abuse of power.

With this order, Trump ""continues to test the bounds of legality,"" policy analyst Tyson Barker told DW.

At least 60 people were arrested in San Francisco as police clashed with demonstrators rallying against immigration raids in Los Angeles.

San Francisco police ""declared an unlawful assembly,"" they said on social media platform X. ""Approximately 60 people were arrested, including juveniles.""

The demonstrations took place in front of a building belonging to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

It was initially peaceful, but police the group of people refused to comply with an order to disperse.

California Governor Gavin Newsom said California will sue the Trump administration over its deployment of the National Guard to quell Los Angeles protests.

Newsom told MSNBC that the lawsuit would challenge the president's move to authorize federal troops without the state's consent.

""Donald Trump has created the conditions you see on your TV tonight. He's exacerbated the conditions. He's, you know, lit the proverbial match. He's putting fuel on this fire, ever since he announced he was taking over the National Guard — an illegal act, an immoral act, an unconstitutional act,"" Newsom said. ""And we're going to test that theory with a lawsuit tomorrow,"" he added.

Jayson Campadonia, news director at NBC News Radio, told DW that people in LA were worried about the ""racial aspect of ICE raids"" because it brought back memories of the 1992 riots in Los Angeles.

Those riots stemmed from the acquittal of four white Los Angeles Police Department officers in the beating of Black motorist Rodney King in 1991. The riots left more than 50 dead and more than 2,000 injured.

This time too, tensions are running high as similar apprehensions come into play, with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers reportedly having taken people into custody during immigration raids, as part of US President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, in the Los Angeles area on Friday.

Campadonia has been to protest sites in LA and said smaller protests converged into a big protest on Sunday.

He said he saw members of the National Guard ""fully there to go to work"" as they stood shoulder to shoulder in the streets on Sunday.

US President Donald Trump said in an early morning social media post that protesters were getting aggressive in Los Angeles referring to an assessment made by the Los Angeles police chief.

LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell delivered a press conference earlier Sunday, saying his officers were targeted during protests and that protests were becoming ""increasingly worse and more violent.""

Jim McDonnell said he would have to ""make a reassessment"" on the need for the National Guard when asked about it at the press conference given the kind of violence that took place Sunday.

According to CNN, McDonnell said that: ""Before I could answer that, I'd have to know more about what their capabilities are, what their role is intended to be, to be able to make that determination.""

""We have tremendous capability here. To say that we'd go to that right away, I'd say we're not – we wouldn't have been there yet. Looking at the violence tonight, I think we gotta make a reassessment,"" he said.

""Don't let these thugs get away with it,"" Trump wrote on social media, adding that it's ""looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!,"" before writing ""ARREST THE PEOPLE IN FACE MASKS, NOW!"" 

Trump has sharply criticized protesters in Los Angeles, widening a political divide between California state authorities and his administration.

Judge Jon S. Tigar pointed directly to the discriminatory intent behind Trump's executive orders.

This piece was republished with permission from Erin In The Morning.

On Monday, a federal court ruled in favor of several federally qualified health centers and LGBTQ+ resource organizations that had either lost funding or faced grant threats under the Trump administration. The decision blocks portions of Trump's executive orders targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, as well as programs accused of promoting so-called “gender ideology.” While the ruling applies only to the named plaintiffs, it is likely to ripple outward — restoring or preserving funding for trans and queer healthcare and research across the plaintiffs' service regions. It also marks yet another instance in which courts have rejected Trump-era directives portraying transgender people as inherently dishonorable — or, at times, nonexistent.

The ruling, issued by Obama appointee Judge Jon S. Tigar, pointed directly to the discriminatory intent behind Trump's executive orders. In siding with the plaintiffs, the court found that the provisions targeting “gender ideology” served no legitimate purpose beyond a transparent desire to harm transgender people: “Plaintiffs argue that the Gender Termination Provision and Gender Promotion Provision fail any level of scrutiny because the Gender Order is “transparently motivated by a ‘bare desire to harm' transgender people.”… Defendants offer no response in their opposition, nor any argument that either provision advances any legitimate government interest, and thus concede the point.”

The case was brought by several major nonprofits serving the LGBTQ+ community, including the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, the GLBT Historical Society, the San Francisco Community Health Center, the Los Angeles LGBT Center, Prisma, the New York LGBT Center, Bradbury-Sullivan, Baltimore Secular Humanists, and FORGE. Collectively, these organizations receive tens of millions of dollars in federal grants, many of which fund services for LGBTQ+ and transgender communities. At least one — San Francisco Community Health Center — has already lost funding for its HIV prevention programs targeting LGBTQ+ populations. The others have received threatening letters.

When asked in court whether or not certain conduct would result in the loss of federal funding, it was posited that even referring to transgender people as their identified gender could result in such funding being stripped. Attorneys for the federal government agreed that this would be impermissible under Trump's executive orders: “As an example, Defendants took the position at hearing that an organization would lose its federal funding if it, in its day-to-day work on within the federally funded program, refers to clients by a pronoun other than Mr., Ms. Mrs., or Miss… under Defendants' logic, an organization receiving federal funds to provide public health services — as many of Plaintiffs do — would not be able to refer to the clients they serve under that project by any pronoun that would “promote gender ideology,” even when addressing them by such pronouns is pure speech that has no relation to the public health objectives for which the federal grants they receive aim to fund.”

The court ruled that such a ban on the “promotion of gender ideology” or “diversity, equity, and inclusion” ran clearly afoul of equal protection on transgender status and also violated the separation of powers which provided their funding: “As one other court considering the Gender Order explained, the Court “cannot fathom discrimination more direct than the plain pronouncement of a policy resting on the premise that the group to which the policy is directed does not exist.” PFLAG II, 2025 WL 685124, at *23.”

Ultimately the court ruled against the federal government and issued a preliminary injunction from enforcing a variety of sections of Trump's anti-transgender executive orders against them. It also rejected the government's plea to issue an administrative stay on it's order, meaning that the government will be immediately blocked from enforcing the anti-transgender provisions on the plaintiffs, which serve large numbers of LGBTQ+ people in their community who could be harmed should the government block their funding. The matter will go forward for a consideration on the merits in coming months.

Trump is trying to pack the courts with inexperienced MAGA loyalists to facilitate his authoritarian agenda.

When Donald Trump finished his first term, he left a radically reshaped federal judiciary in his wake. The president successfully appointed 234 judges to lifetime positions, including three Supreme Court justices, leaving a stamp of conservatism on the courts for decades to come.

Now, federal judges have never been more in the public eye. As Trump aims to enact his unlawful agenda, the courts have become key bulwarks against the far right's rising tide. Even Trump-appointed judges have ruled against him — much to the MAGA movement's chagrin.

This time around, Trump has less judicial ground to cover. Joe Biden similarly rushed to fill seats during his presidency, with the Senate confirming 235 of his nominees. That gave the president the fewest federal judicial vacancies at the start of a term — just 40 — in more than three decades. But Trump's second-term picks thus far reveal that he's invested in pushing the judiciary even further to the right. Frustrated with the rulings of his prior nominees, he's stacking the courts with young MAGA loyalists who will gladly bend to his authoritarian yoke.

Trump's latest nominees went before the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 4. But even before the hearing, Trump indicated that this nomination cycle would be different from previous ones. In late May, his administration blocked the American Bar Association (ABA) from conducting its longstanding pre-hearing vetting process. The country's main legal professional organization has historically worked with both Republican and Democratic administrations to review judicial nominees and rate their qualifications. Breaking from precedent, the Trump administration has barred the ABA from accessing nonpublic information on the judges and has instructed nominees not to fill out the organization's questionnaires. Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Missouri) told Courthouse News that the decision was made because the ABA is an “ideologically captured institution” and compared it to “any other leftist activist group.”

Trump has also loudly severed ties with Leonard Leo, the chair of the conservative legal organization, the Federalist Society. Leo and the Federalist Society previously played an instrumental role in advising Trump on judicial nominees. However, after some of Trump's tariffs were temporarily blocked by a judge he appointed — but not one that Leo recommended — the president called Leo a “sleazebag.” He took to Truth Social in late May to air his grievances, writing, “I am so disappointed in the Federalist Society because of the bad advice they gave me on numerous judicial nominations.” Conservative lawyers and academics associated with the Federalist Society also filed a legal brief challenging Trump's tariffs, and another free-market legal group affiliated with Leo sued to stop them.

Trump is now charting a new course, opting to nominate less experienced judges who he thinks will aid and abet his anti-democratic agenda. Five of Trump's judicial picks appeared before the Senate last week, including Whitney D. Hermandorfer, nominated to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and four nominees for Missouri district courts. Hermandorfer's nomination has received the most pushback, since the 37-year-old attorney lacks the 12 or more years of work experience recommended for one of the nation's highest courts.

Hermandorfer's hearing testimony raised red flags over not only her lack of qualifications but also her disdain for democracy. When Sen. John Kennedy (R-Louisiana) asked Hermandorfer if she would ever advise a client to violate a federal court order, she declined to give a yes-or-no answer and instead pointed to the possibility of extraordinary situations. She also failed to say that only Congress — not the president — can legally suspend habeas corpus (a legal procedure that allows an individual to challenge their unlawful detention) and instead classified its suspension as “an issue that is under active consideration in the political branches.” And Hermandorfer, who's previously filed legal briefs supporting the Trump administration's effort to end birthright citizenship, refused to affirm a basic legal truth: that birthright citizenship is protected by the Constitution.

Additionally, while Trump has recently tried to distance himself from extreme anti-abortion rhetoric given its unpopularity, his nominees have extreme anti-abortion track records. Hermandorfer was lead counsel in a case defending Tennessee's total abortion ban. Missouri Eastern and Western District Court nominee Joshua Divine led legal efforts to stop a ballot initiative from enshrining abortion rights in Missouri's constitution. Divine is also currently representing Missouri in its case against the Food and Drug Administration over its approval of the abortion medication mifepristone, and Missouri Eastern District Court nominee Maria Lanahan has supported mifepristone bans as well.

By the end of his second term, Trump is expected to have appointed enough federal judges to break Ronald Reagan's record of 383. The Brookings Institution predicts that these appointments will likely tilt the court of appeals in Republicans' favor, though only by a slight amount.

But since judges serve life sentences, Trump's appointments will define U.S. legal outcomes for generations to come. And even though he's working with only 49 judicial vacancies currently, Trump has made his endgame clear: more presidential control over the courts, and fewer people standing in his way.

Trump's policies aren't just about ethnic cleansing, they're about ideological cleansing, says writer Jean Guerrero.

President Trump has inflamed tensions over immigration raids in Los Angeles, which his top adviser Stephen Miller described as an insurrection. “They want protesters to react violently to distract from what is really happening, which is that families are being separated, our communities are being devastated, and the people of Los Angeles are standing up to say, ‘We will not stand for this,'” says Jean Guerrero, New York Times contributing opinion writer and author of Hatemonger: Stephen Miller, Donald Trump, and the White Nationalist Agenda. Meanwhile, she notes Trump's budget bill would fund a massive expansion of federal immigration enforcement and turn it into a threat to the civil rights of everyone.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: We begin today's show in Los Angeles as the Trump administration sends more troops into the city following four days of protests against military-style immigration raids. The Pentagon has deployed 700 marines to Los Angeles, and President Trump has deployed an additional 2,000 members of the National Guard, bringing the total National Guard members to 4,000. On Monday, the state of California sued to block the use of National Guard troops. We'll speak to California's Attorney General Rob Bonta later in the broadcast. On Monday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass decried the militarized response.

MAYOR KAREN BASS: We didn't need the National Guard. Why on Earth? What are they going to do? Do you know what the National Guard is doing now? They are guarding two buildings. They are guarding the Federal Building here, in downtown, and they're guarding the Federal Building in Westwood. That's what they're doing. So, they need marines on top of it? I don't understand that. That's why I feel like we are part of an experiment that we did not ask to be a part of.

AMY GOODMAN: Despite the Trump administration's militarized response, community protests against ICE raids are continuing in Los Angeles and other cities. In fact, on Saturday, the day that President Trump will be celebrating his 79th birthday, and there will be Abrams tanks in a birthday parade in Washington, D.C., rolling through the streets of the capital.

We go now to Los Angeles, where we're joined by Jean Guerrero. She's contributing opinion writer at The New York Times and author of the book Hatemonger: Stephen Miller, Donald Trump, and the White Nationalist Agenda.

Jean, why don't we start off by you describing the protests on the streets? Have you been to them? And talk about this unprecedented use of military power, and the Republican Party, the party that champions states' rights, President Trump going against the state's rights to bring in the U.S. military, against the wishes of the local mayor, Karen Bass, and the governor of California, Governor Newsom.

JEAN GUERRERO: Absolutely, Amy. It's great to be here.

I want to be clear about what is happening here. The federal government is going into the diverse communities of Los Angeles to terrorize them. They are showing — ICE is showing up outside of schools, outside of Home Depots, outside of other workplaces. They're snatching people off of the streets, off of their — outside of their homes, in front of their children, often without warrants.

But what's happening in these protests is that people of all races and backgrounds are putting their bodies on the line to protect their friends, their neighbors, their family members from these arrests. And it is a beautiful thing to see. I was just at one of the protests yesterday, where I spoke to grandmothers, you know, white grandmothers, who are going out to protect people that they love and who they're afraid could be picked up by ICE. I spoke to Latinas who are, you know, afraid of being racially profiled and arrested because of the indiscriminate nature of these arrests, but they are nevertheless putting their bodies on the line, because they're citizens and they believe in using their privilege to defend the people that they care about.

And these protests have been largely peaceful. You know, these are people who want to tell ICE that they are not welcome in their communities. And what we're seeing is a provocation. You know, the deployment of the National Guard and the Marines against the wishes of California's leaders, it is an attack on the sovereignty of the state of California, and it is an effort to provoke Angelenos into a violent confrontation. They want protesters to react violently to distract from what is really happening, which is that, you know, families are being separated, our communities are being devastated, and the people of Los Angeles are standing up to say, “We will not stand for this.” But the administration is trying to bait them into violence, to brand them as rebels and justify sweeping federal crackdowns and to create the viral images that will distract Americans from the appalling reality that ICE is kidnapping valued community members and destroying families here in Los Angeles.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Jean, you've posted on social media, quote, “Trump's immigration agenda is not about law and order. It's about re-engineering the racial demographics of this country.” Could you elaborate, especially in terms of the fact that Stephen Miller, Trump's key adviser, has called this a “fight for civilization”?

JEAN GUERRERO: Yeah. You know, this crackdown is personal for Stephen Miller. As I report in my book, Hatemonger, when he was a high school student in Los Angeles, he frequently antagonized his Latino and immigrant classmates, telling them to, quote, “speak English” and to go back to their home countries. Back then, he was criticized for his views, and he has spent his career trying to punish the communities that rejected him.

These mass deportations are not about border security. They're not about crime. They're about erasing the multicultural fabric of places like Los Angeles. And, you know, I want to repeat that this is not about cracking down on crime. Let's remember that on his first day in office, President Trump pardoned the people who violently assaulted law enforcement during the storming of the Capitol on January 6th. So, Trump and Miller are not against crime. They're not against gang members. In fact, in my book, I extensively document Miller's early dreams of being a gangster. What they're doing is they're running a mafia state that scapegoats immigrants as a pretext for the subjugation of us all.

So, again, they do not care about law and order. Miller's central obsession was never illegal immigration. It was always legal immigration. This is why, from day one, you saw the strangling of refugees — access to refugees, a suffocation of the asylum system, strangling of green card access, the attack on birthright citizenship, trying to now invoke the Insurrection Act to deport people indiscriminately, simply based on the color of their skin. So, again, this is not about national security. It is an ideological project of demographic engineering cloaked in the language of law enforcement. And L.A. is resisting.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you talk about the number of journalists who have also been injured by law enforcement these past few days in Los Angeles?

JEAN GUERRERO: Yes. Several journalists, including colleagues of mine, have been hit with nonlethal rounds. Some have been hospitalized. I believe PEN America has recorded at least 27 attacks on L.A. journalists since June 6th. Reporters are being shot with rubber bullets and chemical munitions. And this is very concerning, because these so-called nonlethal rounds can, in fact, be fatal. The respected Chicano journalist Rubén Salazar was killed with a tear gas canister in 1970 while covering protests here in L.A., and that memory lingers for journalists here in the city, especially for Latino journalists who are trying to expose the injustices that are happening in their communities.

AMY GOODMAN: Jean Guerrero, if you can talk about what is happening in — Los Angeles right now is where all of the attention is, because of this unprecedented calling out by Trump and Hegseth, the defense secretary, of the Marines and thousands of National Guard, federalizing them. But, in fact, this is happening all over the country. If you can talk more about the two men you wrote a book about, your book, Hatemongers: Stephen Miller, Donald Trump, and the White Nationalist Agenda? You have Stephen Miller saying that the ICE agents have to go to 7-Elevens, have to go to Home Depots — this is very different than Trump talking about getting the murderers and rapists — and bringing up the number to 3,000 arrests a day. So, you see mass arrests taking place in Texas. You see them in Arizona. We're not even at this point paying attention because of the militarization of Los Angeles.

JEAN GUERRERO: Exactly, yeah. I mean, what you're seeing is sort of exponentially what we saw during the first administration, which is resources are being diverted from serious homeland security investigations, from serious drug trafficking and human trafficking investigations, to try to meet these quotas of human beings rounded up to satisfy Miller's appetite for cracking down on immigrants, whether they're legal or whether they're here illegally.

And one thing that has not gotten enough attention and which I want to underscore is that what's happening in L.A. is people are risking their safety not only to resist what is happening, not only to resist these kidnappings of their valued community members, but to document and to expose and to bear witness to what is happening. They're recording videos of mothers being torn from their children, being arrested outside of courthouses, of pregnant women being roughed up on the streets and being detained, of fathers being separated from their weeping daughters. And these images are crucial, because each act of documentation is chipping away at the alternate reality that Trump and Stephen Miller have created, this alternate reality in which they are cracking down on gangsters and rapists and serious criminals. I cannot emphasize the importance of this enough.

The administration is ramping up deportations to a never-before-seen level, which means that they are more visible than ever. They used to happen in the shadows. Now people can can see it happening everywhere. And people are taking out their phones. They're recording what's happening to their family members, to their friends, you know, to their neighbors down the street. And as a result, these deportations, these arrests are becoming much harder to misrepresent, and this is a threat to the narrative that Trump and Stephen Miller have spent years putting out there.

And so, I really believe that if Los Angeles refuses to be baited into violence, and instead stays disciplined and continues to dedicate themselves to relentless exposure of how ICE is kidnapping innocent people and what they're actually doing to valued members of our community, I think this can all end up backfiring on the Trump administration, and that Trump's attempt to provoke chaos in our communities will end up collapsing under its own cruelty.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Jean Guerrero, I wanted to ask you about the conflict, obviously, that has arisen between the elected officials in California and the Trump administration. You know, I was there as a reporter back in 1992 at the Los Angeles riot back then. And there really is no comparison between the events of the past weekend and 1992. Back then, 60 people — more than 60 people were killed, 12,000 were arrested, over a thousand buildings were damaged. And even by the time that President George H.W. Bush brought in the National Guard, 30 people had already been killed. And he did so at the request of a Republican governor, Pete Wilson, and a Democratic mayor, Tom Bradley. Talk about the difference between how the elected officials are responding here and the excuse that Trump has used to call in the National Guard and the Marines.

JEAN GUERRERO: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, a majority of these protests are peaceful, as I mentioned. You know, you see children at these rallies. These are demonstrations of people who are simply trying to peacefully demonstrate and tell the federal government that they do not want these kidnappings of the people that they love in Los Angeles.

The last time that you had a president issue this — you know, send the National Guard against the governor's wishes, I believe, was in 1963 to enforce desegregation in Alabama. So, it is really unprecedented. And honestly, it's textbook authoritarianism. I mean, you now see, you know, Trump talking about arresting Newsom and other California leaders. And on the one hand, this is shocking, but on the other, it's completely predictable. I mean, this is what authoritarian governments do. They use immigrants as a pretext to go after the opposition. And immigrants are just the first target. If you look at the white nationalist literature that inspired people like Stephen Miller, it vilifies not only law-abiding immigrants, but anyone who defends them. The worst villains are not immigrants in this literature, even though they are described as monsters and as beasts and as threats to Western civilization. The worst villains in this literature — and I'm talking about books like The Camp of the Saints, which Stephen Miller has openly promoted — the worst villains are the white allies of immigrants, the politicians and the activists and the ordinary people who show them empathy. Those are the people who are, quote, “tainted by the milk of human kindness,” as one of Miller's formative books puts it.

And so, the logical conclusion of Trump's policies is not just ethnic cleansing, it is ideological cleansing. It's a purge not just of people, but of principles. They want to root out anyone who believes in compassion for the stranger, who believes in immigrant rights, who believes in a multicultural or multiracial democracy. This is a vision of America where you are American only if you choose hate. And if you choose love or compassion, you are part of what is poisoning the blood of this country. And so, I'm not surprised to see the president coming after innocent people who are not just the immigrants in our communities, but the people who are defending them, who are white, who are Black, who are Brown, who are of all different colors, and who are simply expressing their humanity and their compassion for the other.

AMY GOODMAN: Jean Guerrero, you contributed to a New York Times piece Monday headlined “Seven Hidden Ways Trump's Megabill Would Remake America,” in which you wrote, quote, “This bill would pave the way for the largest investment in federal immigration enforcement since the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 — one that would turn that department into a Trojan horse for an assault on the civil rights of all Americans.” Can you lay out your concerns? We just have a minute.

JEAN GUERRERO: Absolutely. So, nearly two-thirds of Americans live in what is known as the 100-mile border enforcement zone, where people, under this bill — I mean, they already face the risk of warrantless seizures, of racial profiling, of constant surveillance, and this bill just makes it easier and more certain that all Americans in this country, and particularly if you live within that zone, are going to not be able to walk on the street without fear of being detained. You already have detentions and deportations of U.S. citizens, of law-abiding immigrants, without due process. And I think what this bill is doing is it's providing the government with the resources to be able to continue to do that at levels that we have never before seen in this country.

AMY GOODMAN: Jean Guerrero, I want to thank you very much for being with us, New York Times contributing opinion writer and author of Hatemonger: Stephen Miller, Donald Trump, and the White Nationalist Agenda, speaking to us from Los Angeles.

Coming up California's Attorney General Rob Bonta. He's sued President Trump for deploying the National Guard in L.A. Stay with us.

The chaotic trade policies of U.S. President Donald Trump have created a climate of uncertainty that does not bode well for the U.S. economy. In his second inaugural address, in January, Trump declared his intention to fundamentally restructure the United States' place in the global economy. In April, following his announcement of the so-called Liberation Day tariffs, his administration embarked on a wholesale reshaping of generations' worth of international trade policies. But in the weeks since, Washington has reversed course on some tariffs and begun negotiations on others with major trading partners such as China. Meanwhile, U.S. policymakers are making sweeping changes to immigration policy and contemplating restrictions on foreign direct investment. Little wonder that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently described the administration's approach as “strategic uncertainty.”

The outcome of this supposedly strategic uncertainty, however, is predictable. Unless Washington changes course fast, the United States will suffer many of the same consequences that the United Kingdom did in the aftermath of Brexit. By voting to leave the European Union in June of 2016, after nearly half a century of membership, the United Kingdom opted to upend its trade, immigration, and investment arrangements with the rest of the bloc. Brexit ended up being a protracted process, not a single event, as changes to British economic policies took years to negotiate and implement. Policy uncertainty facing the country's businesses surged and remained high for years. That sustained uncertainty did not fundamentally alter the United Kingdom's trade outlook; trade policies that had been in place before the Brexit vote remained mostly unchanged for some time. Indeed, for five years, British exports and imports remained almost constant; only after higher trade barriers with the EU were permanently in place in 2021 did trade volumes begin to fall.

But despite little change in trade policy and volume for the first five years after the Brexit vote, the British economy suffered. The period of prolonged uncertainty ushered in by the Brexit vote hampered business investment. Beginning in 2016, years of stagnant investment slowed the country's growth in labor productivity and real incomes. If Washington continues to embrace “strategic uncertainty,” the United States, too, will likely face years of stagnating investment, sluggish growth in its economic output, and flat or even falling standards of living.

Many initial economic forecasts projecting Brexit's impact predicted that the United Kingdom's trade would fall, leading to lower output. In April 2016, two months before the Brexit vote, the British treasury projected that the United Kingdom's gross domestic product would fall by nearly four percent over 15 years. Other forecasts predicted an immediate post-vote decline in trade and output. But for five years after the Brexit vote, the country's trade changed little. Trade openness, even allowing for the pandemic, moved more or less in line with other peer countries.

Sir Ivan Rogers, the former British ambassador to the EU, presaged the more important, more damaging impact of Brexit in a 2018 speech, when he said, “Brexit is a process, not an event.” Soon after the Brexit referendum, it became clear that British policymakers had little idea what the post-Brexit trade regime with the EU would look like. Around half of the United Kingdom's exports and imports were with the EU and were thus covered by an agreement that the United Kingdom and the EU would need to renegotiate. Non-EU trade was also governed by EU agreements that likewise needed to be replaced.

The major British political parties were split on what to do. “Soft” Brexiteers proposed making minimal changes, hoping to maintain common product safety standards, liberal movement of labor, highly integrated supply chains, and the existing, nearly frictionless trade in goods and services. “Hard” Brexiteers argued that minimal changes would betray the people's wishes and decried the government's slow-going approach as “Brexit in name only.” They preferred independent product standards, limited labor mobility, and the renegotiation of non-EU trade relations. Indeed, in June 2018, the then Brexit secretary David Davis, predicted that new trade deals with Canada and the United States would be secured within two years.

In terms of actual policy changes, virtually nothing happened for nearly five years, as parliamentary and judicial challenges to Brexit came and went. It was not until January 2020 that the United Kingdom exited the EU, and it was not until May of 2021 that the new EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement came into force. And since 2020, no comprehensive new trade agreement has been reached with any substantial non-EU countries, either, despite years of negotiations. Instead, existing EU trade deals with all other nations were effectively rolled over. To this day, Britain's Brexit path remains meandering and slow. In May, the United Kingdom and the EU convened their first summit since the United Kingdom officially departed in late 2020, and contentious negotiations continue in key economic areas such as fisheries and agriculture.

Brexit's years-long process of economic and judicial proposals, disagreements, and negotiations meant sustained policy uncertainty for British companies. And that policy uncertainty turned out to be ruinous for business capital investment. In 1983, Ben Bernanke, later the chairman of the Federal Reserve during the Bush and Obama administrations who was then a young economist at Stanford, published a paper on uncertainty and investment. Bernanke's key insight was that when confronted with high or rising uncertainty, companies with greater sunk investments—those that are unrecoverable—are more likely to delay making additional investments. Such companies will rationally wait for greater clarity on market demand and input costs, which are influenced greatly by government policies, to make innovation efforts.

In reality, a great deal of business investment involves sunk costs, particularly for globally integrated companies. So if a country announces a fundamental change in its global economic relations but then leaves it unclear what new policies will prevail and when, the result is likely to be a sharp and sustained slowdown in capital investment by that country's companies.

This kind of uncertainty-induced investment slowdown is precisely what befell the British economy in the wake of the Brexit vote. British business investment was about $85 billion in the second quarter of 2016; it was barely changed, at about $86.7 billion, in the last quarter of 2024. By contrast, U.S. business investment grew by 35 percent over this period. According to monthly surveys by the Bank of England since 2016, British firms have consistently cited Brexit-related uncertainty as one of their top three concerns. The United Kingdom's National Institute of Economic and Social Research has noted that despite the signing of the trade and cooperation agreement with the EU, “firms remain cautious due to shifting regulatory requirements, potential market access restrictions, and trade frictions.”

Since the referendum, near-zero growth in British capital investment has also slowed growth in British citizens' real incomes to near zero, because slow investment slows growth in labor productivity. Over the same period, inflation-adjusted average incomes in the United Kingdom have risen by only about four percent; at that pace, it would take more than a century for average incomes to double. The typical British household would be earning almost $2,000 more a year today had Brexit not slowed growth in investment, innovation, and the economy overall.

Thus far, the initial impacts of Liberation Day on the United States' economy look ominously like those of Brexit on the United Kingdom's. Nearly every possible indicator measuring the uncertainty that faces American businesses has surged. The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which tracks indicators including news articles discussing policy uncertainty and disagreement among prominent economic forecasts, nearly doubled when Trump was reelected, and then more than doubled again after Liberation Day. Today, it is higher than it was during the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2007–8 financial crisis, or, indeed, any other time since 1985, the earliest year for which data is available.

Leading publicly traded U.S.-based companies, including Ford, Mattel, Southwest, and UPS, have ceased publishing forecasts of future earnings because they say their business outlook is so unclear. And according to both government and private-sector surveys, business investment expectations have plunged. In April, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, a report on the U.S. economy published eight times a year, used the word “uncertainty” an unprecedented 80 times.

The effects of all this uncertainty did not show up in this year's first-quarter statistics for U.S. gross domestic product. Indeed, private capital investment surged at an annual rate of 24.4 percent, as American companies rushed to import capital goods in advance of tariff increases; first-quarter U.S. imports of goods exploded at an unparalleled annual rate of 53.3 percent. But looking ahead, there is every reason to expect capital investment to stagnate.

According to the CEO Economic Outlook Survey for the first quarter of 2025, published by the Business Roundtable, an association of more than 200 CEOs of leading U.S. companies, 58 percent of member companies have forecast flat or falling U.S. capital investment in the next six months. And during this year's first quarter, the number of merger-and-acquisition transactions announced in the United States fell by 19 percent relative to the last quarter of 2024. Among small businesses, only 18 percent planned new capital outlays over that same period, the lowest percentage since April 2020, when the pandemic had just been declared. The hiring of workers has also slowed. The monthly hiring rate—the number of new hires as a proportion of overall employment—was 3.4 percent in the first three months of 2025, the lowest for that period for any year in more than a decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The companies most affected by this uncertainty are the same ones that drive innovation and undertake most of the investment in the United States. In 2022, the most recent year for which data is available, the parent companies of U.S.-based multinationals undertook 43.5 percent of all capital investment by U.S. companies and 66.6 percent of all research and development by U.S. companies.

Despite the climate of uncertainty that Trump's policy chaos has fostered, there are some trends that favor the United States. For at least a year before Trump's reelection, the United States was enjoying a surge in capital investment linked to generative artificial intelligence. Microsoft, for example, has announced plans to invest $80 billion in 2025 in AI-enabled data centers. If the underlying business case for generative AI proves immune to the United States' trade wars, then this important driver of overall U.S. business investment will not wither. Moreover, Trump has repeatedly called for foreign-based multinationals to expand their investments in the United States rather than export their products here.

But the critical issue facing U.S. companies—profound policy uncertainty—remains. Trump has unleashed a dizzying barrage of tariff increases, decreases, pauses, and negotiations with the United States' major trading partners. And there is no indication that his administration is ready to move past its disastrous “strategic uncertainty” approach. Under these circumstances, few globally connected U.S. companies are likely to announce large new capital investments. And foreign-based multinationals are facing the same U.S. policy uncertainty that U.S.-based companies are, which may inhibit their investments in the United States, too.

As the United Kingdom learned after Brexit, uncertainty produces grinding stagnation in capital investment and R & D by private companies. That, in turn, leads to plummeting productivity growth and stagnant real incomes. Instead of learning from this bleak recent history, Americans are now painfully absorbing this lesson by repeating it. According to last month's Surveys of Consumers produced by the University of Michigan, expectations for year-ahead U.S. price inflation have skyrocketed, from 2.8 percent last December to 6.6 percent last month.

The biggest lesson of Brexit is that policy uncertainty can chill business investment, growth in productivity, and incomes—quickly, lastingly, and painfully. The supporters of Trump's “strategic uncertainty” approach have been forewarned.

During his visit to the Middle East in May, U.S. President Donald Trump did several things that few would have predicted months or even weeks earlier. One was his surprise meeting with Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Shara, and the subsequent lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria, notwithstanding Shara's history as a leader of a militant Islamist group. Another was his decision not to include Israel on the itinerary, despite his administration's ongoing efforts to end the war in Gaza. The trip followed the administration's decision in early May to sign a bilateral cease-fire with the Houthis in Yemen, without consulting or including Israel. Along with Trump's initiation of direct talks with Iran—a step that Israel adamantly opposes but Arab leaders in the Persian Gulf welcomed and even helped facilitate—these developments suggest how much the regional balance of power has changed since Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.

The war in Gaza has altered the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. In the years before the October 7 attack, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and other Gulf states shared with Israel the perception that Iran and its alliance of proxy forces were the region's overriding threat. They supported the first Trump administration's “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran, and they began to normalize relations with Israel. Today, the situation has dramatically shifted. Twenty months into the war, Tehran appears far less of a threat to the Arab world. Meanwhile, Israel looks increasingly like a regional hegemon. 

Amid these developments, Washington's Arab allies and Israel are now in opposite camps on the merits of a new nuclear deal. Israel still sees a deal as a lifeline for the Islamic Republic and has been urging the Trump administration instead to take military action to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities. The Gulf states, by contrast, dread a new and potentially uncontainable war on their doorsteps and view a diplomatic resolution with Tehran as vital to regional security and stability. They are also wary of creating a Middle East in which Israel has free rein—even in a future in which normalization with Israel can move forward. In their effort to achieve a new balance between Israel and Iran, the Gulf states have become primary players in Trump's push for a new nuclear deal. Together, they aim to become the fulcrum of a reconfigured regional order.

To grasp the extent of the Gulf states' shift on Iran, it is crucial to recall Saudi Arabia and the UAE's reaction to the first U.S.-Iranian nuclear deal a decade ago. When Iran and the United States signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, in July 2015, the Gulf states shared Israel's concern that it would bolster Iran's regional influence. At the time, the Arab world was still recovering from popular uprisings during the 2010–11 Arab Spring, which had toppled once powerful rulers and sparked civil wars in Libya, Syria, and Yemen. Iran had profited from the tumult, carving a sphere of influence stretching from the Arabian Peninsula to the Levant. In a speech before the U.S. Congress in March 2015, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned, “Iran now dominates four Arab capitals—Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut, and Sanaa.” The Gulf Arab states, like Israel, worried that the United States, in its push for the nuclear accord, was ignoring the growing regional threat posed by the Islamic Republic and its proxies. The same month as Netanyahu's speech, Saudi Arabia announced it was leading a military intervention in Yemen against the Houthis, the insurgent group that was expanding Iran's sphere of influence into the Arabian Peninsula. 

Israel and Washington's Gulf allies may have overstated the prospect of Iranian hegemony in the Middle East, but there was no denying that the turmoil in the Arab world had tilted the regional balance of power in Iran's favor. To its Middle East detractors, the JCPOA was not just about Iran's nuclear capabilities but also about Iran's relative influence. According to the terms of the deal, Iran got sanctions relief just for agreeing to limit its nuclear program; it was not required to rein in its proxy forces in the region. As a result, the deal threatened to increase Iran's sway even as it curbed the country's pursuit of nuclear weapons. Arab states thus joined hands with Israel to underscore this flaw and used it in a high-profile effort to undermine the JCPOA. In addition to aggressively lobbying members of Congress—an offensive symbolized by Netanyahu's 2015 speech—this effort included a public and media campaign against the deal.

During his first administration, Trump concurred with the deal's critics. The United States unilaterally abandoned the JCPOA in 2018 and placed Iran under “maximum pressure” economic sanctions. At the time, the Trump administration expected that this pressure would weaken Iran and shrink its regional influence in favor of a new regional order centered on Israel and Washington's Arab allies. The administration promoted expanded Arab-Israeli security and intelligence cooperation, culminating in the 2020 Abraham Accords—the agreement that normalized relations between Israel and a series of Arab and North African states, including Bahrain and the UAE, and subsequently Morocco and Sudan. It also took a harder line toward Iran's support for proxy forces across the region, to the point of making the highly unusual decision to assassinate Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, the powerful head of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, in Baghdad in 2020. 

The tougher U.S. strategy toward Iran continued under President Joe Biden. Contrary to expectations, the Biden administration did not restore the JCPOA and eschewed engaging with Iran—agreeing to talks only after Iran raised the stakes by accelerating its accumulation of highly enriched uranium. Biden's focus, much like Trump's, was instead on forging an Arab-Israeli axis. Normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia thus became the lodestar of Biden's Middle East policy. Indeed, at the time of Hamas's October 7 attack, the administration thought it was on the cusp of an Israeli-Saudi deal that would bring lasting peace to the region.

As events would soon make clear, that assumption was terribly misguided. The Trump-Biden strategy only aggravated regional tensions. Iran responded to U.S. pressure by expanding its nuclear program and its support for the Houthis in Yemen in their war with the Gulf states. It also began directly attacking U.S. and Gulf interests, most notably Saudi oil facilities, in 2019. Even before the October 7 attack, the Gulf states had lost confidence in Washington's strategy. In March 2023, Saudi Arabia broke ranks to normalize ties with Iran—in a deal brokered by China. One immediate benefit was an end to Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The Gulf states remained committed to expanding ties with Israel, but maintaining a balance between Iran and Israel would prove difficult.

Then came Hamas's attacks and Israel's blistering war in Gaza, which derailed normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. A resurgent “axis of resistance,” backed by Iran—including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, who, along with Hamas saw the prospect of Israeli-Saudi normalization as an existential threat—was now at open war with Israel. The Biden administration assumed that this new regional conflict would strengthen the case for an Israel–Gulf state security alliance, but the Gulf states were loath to be dragged into that conflict. In January 2024, when Biden resolved to respond militarily to the Houthis' attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea, Saudi Arabia and the UAE assiduously avoided getting involved, despite their years-long struggle against the group. Arab states also had to account for the growing anger among the Arab public about the treatment of the people of Gaza, which precluded any further tightening of Arab-Israeli security cooperation. 

Then, in the fall of 2024, a series of Israeli successes turned the tide of the war. In late September, Israel eliminated Hezbollah's top leadership, including the organization's longtime leader, Hasan Nasrallah, in a targeted bomb attack—a strike that followed on the heels of a successful undercover operation that decimated the group's command-and-control structure using exploding pagers. The following month, Israeli forces killed Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who had masterminded the October 7 attack. And in early December, the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, a longtime close Iranian ally, collapsed. Meanwhile, dangerous exchanges of missiles and drones between Iran and Israel raised the stakes but also further dented Iran's aura of power, with Israel claiming to have neutralized many of Iran's air defenses. 

By the end of the year, the axis of resistance had been diminished, and Tehran found itself largely cut off from the Levant. Even Iran's defense of its homeland looked vulnerable. With Trump, a strong backer of Israel, poised to return to the White House, a confident Netanyahu government in Israel saw a rare opportunity to deal a decisive blow to Iran, destroying its nuclear facilities and devastating its economic infrastructure in an attack that would push the Islamic Republic to the brink.

Yet Trump has not followed the expected Israeli script. Worried that military strikes on Iran will pull the United States into a costly war, the president has thus far resisted Israeli pressure to dispense with diplomacy and wage open war on Iran. Instead, he has pushed for a new version of precisely the thing he repudiated during his first term: a nuclear deal. In doing so, he is backed by the Gulf states, which, despite their opposition to the earlier deal, also now favor diplomacy with Iran. Since Trump took office, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE have all counseled against war and acted as intermediaries and mediators between Tehran and Washington. The most obvious reason for this shift is fear of what war in the Gulf would do to their economies. At a more fundamental level, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states see a nuclear deal as central to achieving a new balance of power in the Middle East.

In part, Gulf support for an Iran deal has to do with Israel's own changed position in the region. Even as it continues its offensive in Gaza, Israel has already begun to emerge triumphant, confident in its absolute military superiority, and ready to use it to assert domination over the Middle East. In addition to expanding its occupation of Gaza, which Israeli leaders have suggested could be put under indefinite military rule, Israel has been imposing its will on south Lebanon and is occupying and carrying out military incursions into large swaths of Syria. And now it wants to extend its victorious campaign in the Levant to the Gulf, with a military attack on Iran. In addition to provoking Iranian retaliation that could soon include targets on the Arabian Peninsula, such an attack could disrupt world energy supplies and cast doubt on the long-term viability of the economic boom in the Gulf.

The Middle East's main power brokers, including the Arab states, Iran, Israel, and Turkey, have historically resisted domination by one regional actor. When the Arab world was reaching for primacy under the banner of Arab nationalism in the 1950s and 1960s, Iran, Israel, and Turkey banded together to contain it. Even after the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Israel was not reflexively hostile to Iran if regional power balancing dictated otherwise: in the early years of the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, when Saddam Hussein's Iraq was gaining an upper hand and posing as a claimant to leadership of the Arab world, Israel supplied revolutionary Islamist Iran with intelligence and war materiel. Later, as Iran emerged as a rising power, Israelis joined hands with Arab states to counter it. 

Now that Israel is laying claim to being the region's unrivaled power, Arab states and Iran—and also Turkey—need each other to establish a balance. Among the former are Bahrain, Egypt, and Jordan, which do not have diplomatic relations with Iran but, like other Arab powers, have drastically increased their engagement. Above all, Gulf states have become Iran's crutch in pursuing nuclear negotiations with the United States. The Gulf states understand that, in the rivalry between Iran and Israel, they are the prize. Israel wants an axis with the Arab world that would contain Iran, and Iran wants to deny Israel a footprint in the Arabian Peninsula. For their part, Gulf leaders want a regional order that restrains both Iran and Israel while empowering their own governments. It is this balancing imperative that has turned Washington's Gulf allies from erstwhile opponents of a nuclear deal into strong advocates. As they see it, a new deal between Iran and the United States would deny Israel a path to war with Iran that could spill onto their shores, and then only confirm Israel's unchecked regional supremacy. 

In turn, Iran, which is eager to conclude a nuclear deal to avoid war and boost its ailing economy, has become increasingly dependent on the Gulf states to manage the Trump administration and keep the negotiations going. Oman's foreign minister, for example, has played a key role in the talks by developing proposals that bridge differences between Tehran and Washington; Saudi Arabia has embraced the idea of creating a regional nuclear consortium with Iran to jointly manage uranium enrichment. The Saudi foreign minister has also suggested that the kingdom is willing to use its economic muscle to help a final deal take hold.

Iran and the Gulf states now need each other, and both sides need a nuclear deal. That is a welcome development. It could build trust between the Gulf neighbors, enabling them to deepen their engagement to include security cooperation, investments, and trade. Moreover, reengaging with Iran does not require the abandonment of normalization efforts with Israel. Gulf leaders do not want to have to make a Faustian choice between Iran and Israel. They want relations with both in order to strike a regional balance that works to their countries' advantage and ensures the peace and stability that are vital to the region's geoeconomic goals. For the Gulf states, a nuclear deal would align their strategy with Washington's Middle East policy, which could then be consecrated in a formal strategic partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia.

Trump's recent visit to the Gulf seemed to confirm this expectation. Even before arriving in the region, his administration set aside Israel's concerns and concluded a bilateral cease-fire agreement with the Houthis. At the same time, the ambitious economic deals that Arab leaders offered Trump served as the backdrop to U.S. statements on Gaza, Iran, and Syria that reflected Gulf priorities at the expense of Israel's preferences. At every stop on his trip, Trump reiterated his preference for resolving the Iran nuclear issue through diplomacy. And on occasion, he seemed to acknowledge Arab concerns over the war in Gaza: in Abu Dhabi, for example, he said, “A lot of people are starving in Gaza”—apparently criticizing Israel's ten-week blockade on aid to the territory. 

But for this realignment to truly bring regional peace and stability, the United States must give a new nuclear deal with Iran a broader strategic framing. A deal would need to be reached in tandem with a push to expand the Abraham Accords, normalizing Israel's relations not only with Saudi Arabia but also with other Arab states, such as Syria. To resume normalization efforts with Israel, Riyadh will demand an end to the war in Gaza and a viable political future for the Palestinians. Yet at another level, the United States and its Gulf allies must think of normalization as a necessary complement to both a U.S.-Iranian nuclear deal and the growing Iran–Gulf state axis, with these three pieces together forming a new regional balance. 

Of course, U.S. negotiations with Iran may stall, and Washington could return to a more confrontational course with Tehran. Such an outcome would likely prolong regional conflict and foreclose any possibility of further Arab-Israeli normalization in the near term. But if a deal can be reached, the Gulf states have an opportunity to become the pivot of a new regional order, with axes running through them to Iran, Israel, and the United States. After years of war and turmoil, that might finally offer a real chance to bring stability to the region.

            Mexico's red, white and green flag has become a defining symbol of the protests in Los Angeles.
    


            Demonstrators have waved flags from Mexico and other Latin American countries, as well as US flags, to express solidarity with immigrants and denounce the Trump administration's raids, provoking the ire of Trump's supporters.
    


            Los Angeles has been roiled in protests since Friday, when ICE officers raided several workplaces in the city's garment district. While the protests began peacefully, they have since led to dozens of arrests and some violent clashes. President Donald Trump deployed thousands of National Guard troops and Marines, outraging Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, who in a complaint defined the mobilization of the California guardsmen an “illegal takeover” and on social media called the potential use of the Marines “a blatant abuse of power.”



            The Mexican flag has long been a mainstay at immigration-related demonstrations, particularly in LA, which has deep cultural and economic ties to Mexico and is seen as the capital of the Mexican diaspora in the US. More than 3.4 million people of Mexican heritage or born in Mexico live in Los Angeles County, according to Census data, more than any other county in the US.
    


            But images and video showing flag-waving protesters facing off with police have drawn anger from Republican officials.
    


            “They were literally out there protesting, carrying a foreign flag. That is absolutely insane. They're not just peaceful protesters. These are illegals,” Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin told CNN's Dana Bash, while defending Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to LA.
    


            “Insurrectionists carrying foreign flags are attacking immigration enforcement officers,” Vice President JD Vance posted on X Saturday.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security has shared on social media several photos and videos of the protests where, amid chaotic scenes, the Mexican flag is featured prominently.
    


            Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller described the protesters on social media as “foreign nationals, waving foreign flags, rioting and obstructing federal law enforcement attempting to expel illegal foreign invaders.”
    


            Waving a foreign flag – or even destroying an American one – is legal under freedom of expression rights protected by the Constitution's First Amendment.
    


            Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda, associate professor of Chicana, Chicano and Central American Studies at UCLA, said invoking flags to demonize protesters is a “well-documented move on the part of the Trump administration, knowing that every single demonstration of this type brings out the Mexican flag.”
    


            The current Mexican flag was officially adopted by the country in 1968, though variations have been used since Mexico's war of independence from Spain in the early 1800s.
    


            The brandishing of it and other Latin American flags to defend the rights of immigrants in the US has a long and complex history.
    


            The Mexican flag was a lightning rod during the 1994 movement against California's Proposition 187, which sought to bar undocumented immigrants from accessing education, health care and social services. The flags, waved by protesters to show pride, were seen by many as symbols of anti-American defiance.
    


            In LA, some have argued waving the Mexican flag risks undermining the protesters' cause by alienating people and shifting attention away from immigration policy.
    


            Waving the Mexican flag “transforms what should be a debate about American constitutional rights and due process into a conversation about foreign loyalty and cultural assimilation,” Mike Madrid, a Republican strategist focused on Latino voting trends wrote in the Sacramento Bee.
    


            But the waving of foreign flags speaks to the generations of people from Mexico and other Latin American countries who have called the US, and particularly California, home, Hinojosa-Ojeda said.
    


            “The flags mean their families. The flags mean their communities. It's not about having an international invasion,” he added.
    


            The flags are a “mechanism of pride and identity that is under attack,” Hinojosa-Ojeda added.
    


            Antonio Rodriguez, an organizer with the Brown Berets immigration advocacy group, said the Mexican flag at the protests is a symbol of unity, not division.
    


            “I don't necessarily think just because somebody has pride in their culture that they're un-American,” Rodriguez said.
    


            “Waving a Mexican flag, for us, is showing pride in our culture and our family.”

Live Updates


• On the ground: Demonstrators and police faced off in scattered protests in downtown Los Angeles for a fourth day Monday, with officers using “less lethal” weapons to disperse protesters after objects were thrown at them. At one point, police escorted a CNN crew out of a protest zone. Damage appears to be limited to a portion of downtown, while much of the city has not been affected by the protests.
    


• More troops: About 700 Marines have been activated to help protect federal personnel and property. President Donald Trump is defending his decision to mobilize another 2,000 National Guard members — a doubling of his initial deployment of those troops. California Gov. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass have slammed his actions. 



• The cost: Trump today said the National Guard will stay in Los Angeles “until there's no danger.” A top Pentagon official told Congress the mobilization will cost the Defense Department roughly $134 million.
    


            President Donald Trump warned today that any potential protesters at Saturday's military parade will be met with force.
    


            “For those people that want to protest, they're going to be met with very big force. And I haven't even heard about a protest,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “This is people that hate our country, but they will be met with very heavy force.”
    


            Large fences have already been set up around the White House and surrounding area in preparation for the celebration of the Army's 250th birthday. The parade is also on the president's 79th birthday.
    


            Talking about the reasoning behind the parade, Trump added that if it weren't for the United States winning World War II: “You would be speaking German right now.”
    


            “You might be speaking Japanese. You might be speaking a combination of both,” Trump continued. “We won the war, and we're the only country that didn't celebrate it. We're going to be celebrating big on Saturday.”
    


            President Donald Trump said the National Guard will be in the Los Angeles area “until there's no danger,” declining to put a timetable on ending the deployment amid protests over his administration's immigration crackdown.
    


                    “It's easy. Look, it's common sense. … When there's no danger, they'll leave,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.
                





            Trump authorized the deployment of 2,000 National Guard members on Saturday night amid intensifying protests. On Monday, he doubled that number to 4,000, and 700 Marines were mobilized – all moves the state's Democratic leaders publicly opposed.
    


                    “You would have had a horrible situation had I not sent them in. Horrible. You'd reporting on a lot of death and a lot of destruction that's not going to take place,” Trump said Tuesday.
                





            The memorandum signed by Trump states that the guard's service will last 60 days at the discretion of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.
    


            Trump also made clear that his team's aggressive immigration enforcement efforts will continue, including in other parts of the country.
    


            President Donald Trump again hedged on whether he will invoke the Insurrection Act to escalate military intervention in Los Angeles.
    


            “If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it, we'll see. But I can tell you last night was terrible, the night before that was terrible,” Trump told reporters today during an impromptu Oval Office appearance.
    


            Pressed specifically on how he will determine “insurrection,” Trump said, “Well, you take a look at what's happening.”
    


                    “There were certain areas of Los Angeles, last night, you could have called it an insurrection, it was terrible. But these are paid insurrectionists. These are paid troublemakers. They get money,” Trump said, repeating a claim made without evidence by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem yesterday.
                





            While Trump and his allies have repeatedly hinted they could invoke the Insurrection Act, CNN reported yesterday that administration lawyers have been working to craft a much less confrontational way of protecting the federal government's ability to carry out immigration enforcement, hoping to avoid further inflaming the situation, according to multiple people briefed on the discussions.
    


            Lawmakers are weighing in on the protests in downtown Los Angeles, with some defending President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and mobilization of the National Guard and Marines without Gov. Gavin Newsom's consent, and others condemning the actions.
    


Here's what some lawmakers saying: 



            The mobilization of US Marines and National Guard troops to respond to protests in Los Angeles will cost the Defense Department roughly $134 million, a top Pentagon official told Congress today.
    


                    “The current estimated cost is $134 million which is largely just (temporary duty) cost, travel, housing, food, etc.,” Bryn MacDonnell, a special assistant to the Secretary of Defense and official performing the duties of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), told the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense.
                





            When asked by Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar where that funding is coming from, MacDonnell responded it was coming from “other (Operation and Maintenance) accounts.”
    


            MacDonnell was testifying today before the subcommittee alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine.
    


            Hegseth said today that the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles would last 60 days, and his office was ensuring that they are “housed, fed,” and have adequate water and capabilities.
    


            Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has issued a stern warning to anyone participating in vandalism and looting in downtown Los Angeles.
    


            “ANYONE who vandalized Downtown or looted stores does not care about our immigrant communities,” the mayor said in a post on X. “You will be held accountable.”
    


            “Angelenos have the right to make their voices heard through peaceful protest, but people cannot fall into the (Trump) Administration's trap. Violence and vandalism is unacceptable.No one should be put in danger – not law enforcement, not protestors,” a note from the mayor's office said, adding that Bass continues to urge everyone to be peaceful.
    


            Bass is scheduled to give a situation update at 10:30 a.m. PT today.
    


            The commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Eric Smith, said the battalion deployed to Los Angeles is already there and ready to follow the orders from the US Northern Command, but clarified they have not yet been called to respond.
    


            Smith testified at a budget hearing before senators that those Marines are trained for crowd control, and they would have shields and batons as their equipment. He said they have no arrest authority, and are only there to protect federal property and federal personnel.
    


            When asked by Sen. Richard Blumental, a Connecticut Democrat, about the danger that Marines would use lethal force that could result in injuries and deaths, Smith said he had faith in them.
    


            “I am not concerned. I have great faith in my Marines and their junior leaders and their more senior leaders to execute the lawful tasks that they are given.”
    


            Residents of downtown LA, where a small portion of the area has been impacted by anti-ICE protests, have told CNN how they feel about the Marines being activated, with one word coming up frequently – excessive.
    


Michael Marshall said he believed it was a “waste of money,” and described President Donald Trump's actions as “fearmongering, it's just causing havoc.”
    


            “Do things ethically and with everyone in mind. That's all I'd say. Do things with everyone in mind … you're hurting everybody you know with these actions,” he said.
    


            Another resident, Juan Robledo, said he felt “It seems pretty excessive to deal with civilians that way.”
    


            For Priscilla Martinez, a Mexican American, the protests “hit close to home.”
    


“I believe that people have the right to protest. I feel like everything that's going on, we need to protect our people. This is beyond words,” she said.
    


            Deploying the Marines was “Excessive – I think the police should be able to handle it and control it,” Martinez told CNN. She felt safe around the protests, but not around the military, “at the moment,” she said.
    


            “None of the protesters have done any harm to me, I've passed by them and I just see them protesting. I'm around here, I walk these streets every day. The protesters in my opinion haven't done anything to me. If anything, I just feel like there's a lot of terror that's happening to them.”
    


            The Graffiti Abatement team from CRCD Enterprises has begun cleaning up the graffiti left by demonstrators that have been gathering near the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles since Friday.
    


            One member of the team said he thinks crowds will come out tonight and he fully expects to have to do it all again Wednesday morning.
    


            Fresh graffiti can be seen for several blocks all over buildings, sidewalks, overpasses, and signs.
    


            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was pressed to provide answers on how the National Guard and Marine mobilization to Los Angeles was being funded during today's House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense hearing.
    


            Hegseth said the Defense Department will “have the capability to cover down on contingencies” under the FY2026 budget request.
    


            Minnesota Rep. Betty McCollum, the ranking Democratic member of the subcommittee, probed Hegseth on the specifics of how the latest move by the administration is going to impact the budget:
    


                    “What is the current cost for what is taking place in California, and how is it going to affect this budget, or the budget we're currently serving under?” McCollum asked during today's hearing. “Where in your limited budget, sir, are you going to find in the remainder of this fiscal year, are you going to pull the money to cover these deployments, what holes are being created?” 
                





            Hegseth initially declined to answer the question directly, instead reiterating that he believes Immigration and Customs Enforcement “has the right to safely conduct operations in any state and any jurisdiction in the country,” and calling back to the 2020 protests in Minneapolis in which he said the National Guard was mobilized “far too late.” He was further prodded to answer by McCollum and Republican Rep. Kevin Calvert of California, chairman of the subcommittee.
    


                    Hegseth ultimately responded that under the new budget request, the Defense Department will “have the funding to cover down on contingencies, especially ones as important as maintaining law and order in a major American city.”
                





            On the heels of anti-ICE protests in downtown Los Angeles, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California is concerned about the safety of friends and family who are demonstrating, along with the immigrants who were taken into ICE custody with no access to legal representation, its director told CNN's Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown.
    


            Eva Bitran, the director of immigrants' rights at the ACLU of Southern California, said most of what she's seen is “people really worried about their immigrant friends and families, their loved ones and their neighbors,” adding “everyone has a right to engage in First Amendment-protected conduct.”
    


                    “It's important to recognize that people are heartbroken and really, really angry because ICE is kidnapping beloved members of our community and our families, and protest is an outlet for this righteous anger,” she added.
                





            As for the detainees in ICE custody, Bitran said she spoke with an immigrant who was detained last week from Monday to late Thursday in a federal building, inside a “completely overcrowded” room with metal benches, no hot food, no access to menstrual products and no access to water — only small juice boxes.
    


            “This is how we understand that the federal government is treating people they're detaining,” she said.
    


            President Donald Trump's visit to Fort Bragg on Tuesday is intended as a kickoff to a week of celebrations marking the US Army's 250th birthday, which will culminate in a major military parade on Saturday.
    


            But the backdrop to the visit, along with this weekend's event, is Trump's decision to activate National Guard troops and mobilize active-duty Marines to Los Angeles amid anti-immigration enforcement protests.
    


            Both moves underscore Trump's willingness to reshape how a president utilizes the military. And both reflect actions the president attempted to take during his first term, only to be talked down by military leaders at the time.
    


            Trump has said the troop activation is necessary to protect federal property and personnel, though has offered mixed messages on why the additional deployments are necessary.
    


            He said Monday the situation in Los Angeles was “very well under control” shortly before the deployment of 700 Marines was announced by the Pentagon.
    


            On Tuesday at Fort Bragg, the nation's largest military installation, Trump will watch a demonstration and deliver remarks focused on the Army's birthday.
    


            The situation in Los Angeles has “calmed slightly” due to the presence of the National Guard, the Department of Homeland Security's assistant secretary for public affairs said in an interview with CNN's John Berman.
    


            “I think that things have calmed slightly, John, because of the leadership of President (Donald) Trump,” Tricia McLaughlin told CNN.
    


            She said that the president made the decision to call in the National Guard after ICE enforcement officers and law enforcement were “completely surrounded” by protesters over the weekend, which she said demonstrated “major courage” and “leadership” from Trump.
    


            President Donald Trump defended his controversial decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles — against California Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes — amid anti-ICE protests in a new post on Truth Social.
    


            “If I didn't ‘SEND IN THE TROOPS' to Los Angeles the last three nights, that once beautiful and great City would be burning to the ground right now, much like 25,000 houses burned to the ground in L.A. do to an incompetent Governor and Mayor,” Trump claimed, appearing to reference wildfires that ravaged the state earlier this year.
    


            As CNN reported, 700 Marines are also being dispatched to LA and will join the National Guard in response to the protests.
    


            Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass criticized the government yesterday for sending troops, saying the city was being used as a “test case” for taking away power from local government.
    


Remember: The protests are largely concentrated to a portion of downtown LA, with much of the city continuing to function as normal.
    


            “Anarchists” are exploiting ongoing anti-ICE protests, Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said Tuesday.
    


            “Anarchists” and opportunists are “taking advantage of a situation that unfortunately continues to escalate,” Barger told CNN's Sara Sidner.
    


            Barger's concern is not about the peaceful protesters, but about “those that are embedded that are really attacking law enforcement,” she said.
    


                    “But then, of course, we have looting taking place downtown, Barger said. “Again, individuals that are not there to protest ICE, they're there to take advantage of the situation.”
                





            The protests are largely concentrated to a portion of downtown LA, with much of the city continuing to function as normal.
    


            When asked if President Donald Trump's decision to call in the National Guard and Marines has heightened tensions, Barger said, “No. I feel actually, I think that we're all really guilty.”
    


            “Because the leaders need to be the voice of reason, the setting the tone and the rhetoric that's taking place, quite frankly, is not helping the situation. It's important to communicate both at the state and federal level.”
    


            California Democratic Rep. John Garamendi told CNN that President Donald Trump's response to the protests in downtown Los Angeles is “about Trump pretending that he is the king of this nation, that he has the ultimate power and authority to do anything he wants to do.”
    


            Garamendi said the “very significant blowback” created by recent immigration raids and Trump's actions were to be expected. “They are not finding criminals. They're finding people that are hard-working family members, some of them are in school. They've created fear all across this country,” he said.
    


            The congressman said he hopes that state and local police can maintain control and that “this whole thing quiets down.”
    


            “Protests are perfectly appropriate and legitimate, but they have to be peaceful protests,” Garamendi added. “They cannot be violent. They cannot be throwing rocks and bottles at the police. That is wrong, and those people should and probably would be arrested.”
    


            CNN correpsondent Stephanie Elam is in downtown Los Angeles, the site of much of the anti-ICE protest action over the past five days.
    


            While some buildings have been vandalized, and there is graffiti in downtown, much of Los Angeles has not been affected by the protests, she said.
    


            But she noted that what set this protest apart from others is the level of vandalism.
    


                    “The tagging, the graffiti this time is so much more than we've seen at other times,” she said.
                





            CNN's Sara Sidner is also reporting live from Los Angeles, where she said that the damage was “not a sliver just of Los Angeles, it's really a sliver of downtown. Much of the rest of the city is functioning as per normal.”
    


            Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth will be on Capitol Hill for a series of congressional hearings this week. It's his first time testifying since his confirmation hearings in January.
    


            The administration will be watching how Hegseth defends President Donald Trump's use of the military domestically — both in California, where Trump activated the California National Guard over the will of state and local officials in response to the LA protests, and at the border, where nearly 10,000 active duty troops have been deployed to help deter migrants from crossing into the US.
    


            On Saturday night, Hegseth posted on X that “the@DeptofDefense is mobilizing the National Guard IMMEDIATELY to support federal law enforcement in Los Angeles. And, if violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized – they are on high alert.”
    


            That comment raised eyebrows both at the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security, where officials wondered why Marines would need to be deployed in addition to National Guard troops and what their tasks would be. Lawmakers will likely have similar questions about how the troops have been trained, what their mission is in LA, and what their instructions are for the use of force.
    


            Lawmakers will also have their first chance to question Hegseth under oath about his role in Signalgate, in which he and other national security officials discussed detailed military plans in a text chain that inadvertently included a prominent journalist.

            Protests against immigration enforcement action are popping up around the country.
    


            Here's where else they're taking place across California:
    


            Elsewhere in the country, anti-immigration protests took place in:
    


            Separately, labor leaders in various locations have called for the release of David Huerta, an influential union leader who was detained in the LA protests and later released on bond. The demonstrations for his release took place in cities including:
    


            Police have used a variety of tools to disperse crowds and quell protests that had devolved into violence in Los Angeles.
    


            CNN has documented the deployment of flash-bangs, tear gas, pepper balls, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, as well as more traditional gear such as batons.
    


            These weapons – often described as “less lethal,” “less-than-lethal” or “non-lethal” – are those “explicitly designed and primarily employed to incapacitate … while minimizing fatalities, permanent injury to personnel, and undesired damage to property, facilities, materiel, and the environment,” according to a Department of Defense directive.
    


            That does not mean they are harmless: After the 2020 protests in response to the police killing of George Floyd, researchers found many people suffered injuries from less lethal weapons – particularly rubber bullets.
    


            Here's a look at the equipment:
    


Blunt-force weapons and projectiles: 



            Authorities have used several tools that a 2025 report by the non-partisan Congressional Research Service noted for their ability to incapacitate using blunt force.
    


Chemical irritants



            Law enforcement agencies in Los Angeles have also turned to chemical irritant devices, which rely on chemical compounds to irritate the sinuses, lungs and skin, causing enough pain to render an individual temporarily unable to function.
    


Flash-bangs devices – thrown either by hand or with a launcher – use an “explosive propellant to emit a bright flash of light … and ear-piercing sound,” the CRS report says. Read more about the tools here.

            Estrellazul Corral joined protests outside the Los Angeles Metropolitan Detention Center every day this weekend to demand justice for the dozens of migrants detained by armed ICE agents in armored vehicles who targeted jobsites in the city's predominately Latino communities.
    


            After hours of peaceful demonstrations, Corral, a social worker focused on the city's unhoused and undocumented population, said the National Guard began to push back.
    


            “They threw tear gas at us, and we were doing what they were telling us to do,” she said. “Then people just got really upset and angry. And I think that's where you see things starting to escalate.”
    


            As the sun set Sunday evening, CNN correspondents documented how the demonstrations descended into violence. Some protesters torched self-driving cars. Some rained rocks down on police sheltering under a highway overpass after marchers shut down traffic. Others spray painted anti-law enforcement slogans on a downtown federal building. At least 21 people were arrested Sunday, the Los Angeles Police Department said.
    


            The raids are in keeping with the Trump administration's hardline approach to illegal immigration. But President Trump's decision to federalize and deploy the National Guard against American citizens – the first time a US president has used such power since 1992, when riots erupted after the White officers who beat Black motorist Rodney King were acquitted – sparked a swift backlash that later grew violent.
    


            Indeed, the protests appeared divided into separate groups: progressive citizens who felt called to defend the rights of the undocumented, and protesters who appeared determined to drag the city into violent chaos.
    


Unión del Barrio, an organization whose members are dedicated to defending the rights of “la raza” – or Mexican and indigenous people – within the United States, praised the efforts to fight back against ICE and other agencies.
    


            The Los Angeles community has “the moral authority and universal right to defend our people from kidnappings and family separation,” said a spokesman for the organization in a statement on social media.
    


            “What has happened these days weren't acts of vandalism or crime, they were acts of resistance against a government that is kidnapping our fathers, our mothers, our wives, our husbands, our children,” the spokesman said.  “The people did it out of a deep love and sense of justice for our families and our people.”
    


            But one county official described Sunday as “probably one of the most volatile nights” in the city.
    


            Jim McDonnell, chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, spoke out against the violent attacks against his officers. At the same time, he drew a distinction between those who protested peacefully during the day and those who stoked the violence at night.

LA police confront protesters as Trump doubles National Guard deployment



            “When I look at the people who are out there doing the violence, that's not the people that we see during the day who are legitimately out there exercising their First Amendment rights to be able to express their feelings about the immigration enforcement issue,” he said.
    


            A senior law enforcement source told CNN that intelligence analysts have been conducting assessments on the crowds that gathered Sunday night. They found the many of the protesters were motivated by the recent immigration raids and disdain for the federal government's deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles.
    


            But some protesters, the intelligence source said, fit law enforcement profiles of so-called “professional rioters,” who continually seek out confrontation with law enforcement.
    


            In her first appearance since the federal government launched its response to Los Angeles protests, US Attorney General Pam Bondi lambasted the clashes between protesters and law enforcement and promised a crackdown from the Justice Department.
    


            The DOJ has “nine open cases” connected to the protests in LA, Bondi said in an interview with Fox News on Monday evening. She did not specify whether the department had brought charges in those cases or if they were still in the initial phases of investigation.
    


            CNN has reached out to the department for clarification.
    


            One of those investigations is into a masked individual who was filmed breaking cinderblocks and throwing shards at law enforcement officers, she said.
    


            Federal prosecutors will also bring charges against those who assaulted federal officers and local police, Bondi said.
    


            After being informed ICE agents were questioning workers at a Pasadena hotel, Pablo Alvarado, the co-executive director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, began calling for protests to protect vulnerable immigrant communities throughout the city.
    


            “The Pasadena community showed up in large numbers and the message was loud and clear, we don't want to see your armored vehicles, men in masks coming to our communities to pick people up to rip families apart.”
    


            But, Alvarado added, he felt the violence that spread throughout the city in response to the raids was tainting their cause.
    


            “Every time that there's violence the most vulnerable communities pay the price. Every time that there are riots, we see the business of low-income communities get burned down,” he said.
    


            “The anger is understandable because you've seen armored vehicles and ICE agents armed to the teeth come into the neighborhoods,” he said.
    


            But while he can understand why protesters are angry, Alvarado said there's no excuse for violence. “We can send the message that we want to send without attacking anybody,” he said.
    


            Blocks away from the charred husks of self-driving cars and graffiti-tagged buildings, the families of the people who were detained in the weekend's immigration raids held a news conference Monday morning to call for their loved ones to be released from ICE custody.
    


            Clutching signs with photos of their relatives, they each approached the microphone and asked for their loved one's rights and due process to be respected.
    


            A young woman named Julian said her entire family was traumatized by watching her father be shackled and led away by ICE agents, but his arrest has been particularly hard on her 4-year-old brother, who is disabled.
    


            Although he struggles to communicate, Julian said, her brother hasn't stopped asking for his dad since he was “kidnapped by ICE.” “We've told him ‘He's working,'” she said.
    


            But the truth, she added, has been far more difficult to explain. “We live in a city that considers itself to be a sanctuary city, but we've all seen that it is not.”
    


            Another young woman named Montserrat told reporters her father, George Arrazola, was among the dozens detained in the raid on Los Angeles' Fashion District.
    


            “I was present,” she said. “I saw with my own eyes the pain of the families crying, screaming, not knowing what to do, just like me,” she said.
    


            She called for Los Angeles' status as a “sanctuary city” to be respected.
    


            “No matter where a person comes from, or how they arrived in this country, their lives (are) valuable,” she said. “The treatment they received is not right – we demand justice now.”
    


            That's why Corral said she kept coming back – despite being repeatedly tear gassed and kettled by law enforcement – because she wanted the people detained to know someone was there, standing up for them.
    


            But after days of inhaling pepper spray, Corral said as she faced down the line of armed US National Guardsmen Sunday, she began to wonder what was happening in her country.
    


            “People were screaming, ‘Those are weapons of war. Those are weapons to murder people, to kill people in a war zone – that is not for a situation like this,” she said. “We stood our ground and were like, ‘We're not going to let them intimidate us.'”

The images of cars set ablaze, protesters tossing rocks at police and officers firing nonlethal rounds and tear gas at protesters hearkens back to the last time a president sent the National Guard to respond to violence on Los Angeles streets.

But the unrest during several days of protests over immigration enforcement is far different in scale from the 1992 riots that followed the acquittal of white police officers who were videotaped beating Black motorist Rodney King. 

President George H.W. Bush used the Insurrection Act to call in the National Guard after requests from Mayor Tom Bradley and Gov. Pete Wilson. After the current protests began Friday over Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, President Donald Trump ordered the deployment of 4,100 National Guard troops and 700 Marines despite strident opposition from Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom. 

Trump cited a legal provision to mobilize federal service members when there is “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit Monday saying Trump had overstepped his authority. 

Outrage over the verdicts on April 29, 1992 led to nearly a week of widespread violence that was one of the deadliest riots in American history. Hundreds of businesses were looted. Entire blocks of homes and stores were torched. More than 60 people died in shootings and other violence, mostly in South Los Angeles, an area with a heavily Black population at the time. 




Unlike the 1992 riots, protests have mainly been peaceful and been confined to a roughly five-block stretch of downtown LA, a tiny patch in the sprawling city of nearly 4 million people. No one has died. There's been vandalism and some cars set on fire but no homes or buildings have burned.

At least 50 people have been arrested for everything from failing to follow orders to leave to looting, assault on a police officer and attempted murder for tossing a Molotov cocktail. 

Several officers have had minor injuries and protesters and some journalists have been struck by some of the more than 600 rubber bullets and other “less-lethal” munitions fired by police. 

The 1992 uprising took many by surprise, including the Los Angeles Police Department, but the King verdict was a catalyst for racial tensions that had been building in the city for years.

In addition to frustration with their treatment by police, some directed their anger at Korean merchants who owned many of the local stores. Black residents felt the owners treated them more like shoplifters than shoppers. As looting and fires spread toward Koreatown, some merchants protected their stores with shotguns and rifles.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Calley Means has built a following within the “Make America Healthy Again” movement by railing against the failings of the U.S. health system, often pinning the blame on one issue: corruption.

Means, a top aide to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was hired as a White House adviser in March. He has used that perch to attack the nation's leading physician groups, federal agencies and government scientists, claiming they only protect their own interests in the nation's $4.9 trillion-a-year industry.

In recent interviews, speeches and podcasts he has called the American Medical Association “a pharma lobbying group,” labeled the Food and Drug Administration “a sock puppet of industry,” and said federal health scientists have “overseen a record of utter failure.”

Means, however, has his own financial stake in the sprawling health system. He's the co-founder of an online platform, Truemed, that offers dietary supplements, herbal remedies and other wellness products. Some of the vendors featured on Truemed's website are supporters of Kennedy's MAHA movement, which downplays the benefits of prescription drugs, vaccines and other rigorously tested medical products. 

Kennedy has pledged to run the Department of Health and Human Services with “radical transparency,” but Means has never had to publicly disclose his own financial details or where exactly they intersect with the policies he's advancing.




“It reeks of hypocrisy,” said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, a health researcher at Yale University. “In effect, he is representing another industry that is touting nonregulated products and using his platform within the government to financially benefit himself.”

In a written statement, Means said his government work has not dealt with matters affecting Truemed and has focused on issues like reforming nutrition programs and pressuring companies to phase out food dyes.

“Pursuing these large-scale MAHA goals to make America healthy has been the sole focus in my government work,” Means said.

Truemed helps users take tax-free money out of their health savings accounts, or HSAs, to spend on things that wouldn't normally qualify as medical expenses, such as exercise equipment, meal delivery services and homeopathic remedies — mixtures of plants and minerals based on a centuries-old theory of medicine that's not supported by modern science. 

The business model caught the attention of the IRS last year, which issued an alert: “Beware of companies misrepresenting nutrition, wellness and general health expenses as medical care.”

Truemed co-founder and CEO, Justin Mares, said in a statement the company is “in full alignment” with IRS guidelines.

“Truemed enables patients to work with providers to use medical funds for root cause interventions like exercise and vitamin D to reverse disease under current law,” Mares said.

The full extent of Means' potential conflicts — including his personal investments— are unclear because of his status as a special government employee.

“It's a big problem,” says Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush now at the University of Minnesota. Painter and other experts have raised alarms over a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government's public integrity guardrails.

Still, part-time government employees are subject to the same law that bars all federal staffers from working on issues that could directly benefit their finances. When such cases arise, they must recuse themselves or risk criminal penalties.

Means regularly opines on matters before HHS, including rethinking the use of drugs for depression, weight loss, diabetes and other conditions. Recently he's been promoting a new government report that calls for scaling back prescription medications in favor of exercise, dietary changes and other alternatives.

“If we rely less on our medical system, less on drugs, it necessitates the spiritual, cultural conversation about what we're doing to our children's bodies,” Means said in a recent podcast appearance.

Experts note that government ethics rules are intended to both prevent financial conflict violations, but also the appearance of such conflicts that might undermine public trust in government.

“If I were running the ethics office over at HHS, I sure as heck wouldn't want anybody going around giving interviews and speeches about government matters that could have an effect on their own financial interests,” Painter said.

Means' rapid rise reflects the seeming contradictions within the MAHA movement itself, which urges followers to distrust both big corporations and the government agencies which regulate them.

Means rails against big pharma and food conglomerates, two industries that he says he spent years working for as a consultant in Washington. 

Means has no medical training. A graduate of Harvard Business School, he previously ran a bridal gown startup with his wife. On Wednesday, he's scheduled to be the keynote speaker at FDA's annual science forum, according to a copy of the program shared with The Associated Press.

He traces his passion for health care reform to the death of his mother from pancreatic cancer in 2021. Shortly thereafter, Means and his sister, Dr. Casey Means, took psychedelics together and had “a mind-blowing, life-changing experience,” which led them to co-author a wellness book, launch separate health startups and begin appearing on podcasts.

Casey Means was recently nominated to be surgeon general and has faced scrutiny over her qualifications, including an unfinished medical residency.

Asked about her nomination, President Donald Trump said: “Bobby thought she was fantastic,” adding that he did not know her.

Meanwhile, her brother has stepped up his rhetoric for the MAHA agenda, recently declaring that Kennedy has “a spiritual mandate to reform our broken system.”

While promoting the administration's accomplishments, Means does not shy away from plugging his own brand or those of his business partners.

When asked to offer health advice to listeners of a sports podcast, Outkick The Show, in April, Means said: “Read our book, ‘Good Energy.'”

He also recommended blood tests sold by Function Health, which provides subscription-based testing for $500 annually. The company was cofounded by Dr. Mark Hyman, a friend of Kennedy and an investor in Truemed, which also offers Hyman's supplements through its platform. Casey Means is also an investor in Hyman's company.

“If you're sick, most likely you have some kind of nutrient deficiency, some kind of biomarker that you can actually then target with your diet and your supplements,” Calley Means said.

Like dietary supplements, the marketing claims on laboratory tests sold by Hyman are not approved by the FDA. The agency has warned for years about the accuracy of such tests and tried to start regulating them under President Joe Biden.

Experts say MAHA entrepreneurs like Hyman are following a playbook common to the wellness industry: Identify a health concern, market a test to diagnose it and then sell supplements or other remedies to treat it.

“It ends up favoring these products and services that rest on flimsy grounds, at the expense of products that have actually survived a rigorous FDA approval process,” said Dr. Peter Lurie, a former FDA official who is now president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

Many of the items sold via Truemed, including sweat tents, cold plunge tanks and light therapy lamps, wouldn't typically qualify as medical expenses under rules for HSAs, tax-free accounts created by Congress to manage medical costs.

The IRS generally states that HSA purchases must help diagnose, cure, treat, mitigate or prevent disease.

Truemed allows users to request a “letter of medical necessity” from a doctor, stating that the product in question could have medical value for them. Like other telehealth services, there's usually no real-time communication with the patient. The physician reviews a “simple survey solution,” filled out by the Truemed user, according to the company's website.

Industry representatives say customers should be careful.

“You need to be prepared to defend your spending habits under audit,” said Kevin McKechnie, head of the American Bankers Association's HSA council. “Companies are popping up suggesting they can help you manage that process and maybe they can — so the debate continues.”

Americans have an estimated $147 billion in HSA accounts, a potential windfall for companies like Truemed that collects fees for transactions made using their platforms.

Means sees an even bigger opportunity — routing federal funds out of government programs and into more HSAs.

“The point of our company is to steer medical dollars into flexible spending,” Means told fitness celebrity Jillian Michaels, on her podcast last year. “I want to get that $4.5 trillion of Medicare, Medicaid, everything into a flexible account.”

Means' pitch for expanding HSAs echoes two decades of Republican talking points on the accounts, which were created in 2003 to encourage Americans in high-deductible plans to be judicious with their health dollars.

But HSAs have not brought down spending, economists say. They are disproportionately used by the wealthiest Americans, who have more income to fund them and a bigger incentive to lower their tax rate.

Americans who earn more than $1 million annually are the group most likely to make regular HSA contributions, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than half Americans with HSAs have balances less than $500.

Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill” would further expand HSA purchases, making gym memberships and other fitness expenses eligible for tax-free spending. That provision alone is expected to cost the government $10 billion in revenue.

“These are really just tax breaks in the guise of health policy that overwhelmingly benefit people with high incomes,” said Gideon Lukens, a former White House budget official during the Obama and Trump administrations, now with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Expanding HSA eligibility was listed as a goal for a coalition of MAHA entrepreneurs and Truemed partners, founded by Means, which lobbied Congress last year, according to the group's website. 

Means said in a statement that the group focused only on broad topics like “health care incentives and patient choice — but did not lobby for specific bills.”

In total, the HSA expansions in Trump's bill are projected to cost the federal government $180 billion over the next 10 years. As HSAs expand to include more disparate products and services, Lukens says the U.S. government will have fewer dollars to expand medical coverage through programs like Medicaid.

“We have a limited amount of federal resources and the question is whether we want to spend that on health and wellness products that may or may not be helpful for wealthy people,” Lukens said.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has refused to answer questions on the cost of deploying Marines to L.A. when asked by the subcommittee's top Democrat. Rep. Betty McCollum said “this is a deeply unfair position to put our Marines in.“

After persistent questioning from members of Congress on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth turned to his acting comptroller, Bryn Woollacott MacDonnell, who provided the amount it would cost to send the National Guard and Marines to immigration protests in Los Angeles. She said the $134 million will come from operations and maintenance accounts.

▶ Follow live updates on the immigration protests

Rep. David Valadao, a moderate Republican who represents much of the state's San Joaquin Valley, expressed concern over the scenes in Los Angeles and urged for peaceful protest. 

He added that he had expressed concerns to the Trump administration over how it is conducting ICE raids in the Golden state.

“I support the First Amendment right to peacefully protest, but the violence and vandalism happening in Los Angeles is unacceptable and I stand with our law enforcement officers working to protect people and regain control over the situation,” Valadao wrote on social media. 

“I remain concerned about ongoing ICE operations throughout CA and will continue my conversations with the administration — urging them to prioritize the removal of known criminals over the hardworking people who have lived peacefully in the Valley for years.”

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard says artificial intelligence accelerated the release of thousands of pages of previously classified documents relating to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.

Experts had predicted the process could take many months or even years, but AI was able to quickly scan for any material that should remain classified, Gabbard told the audience at the Amazon Web Services summit Tuesday.

“We have been able to do that through the use of AI tools far more quickly than what was done previously — which was to have humans go through and look at every single one of these pages,” Gabbard said.

Trump said he isn't worried about things getting out of hand with the military on the ground in Los Angeles.

Asked if he was concerned, Trump said, “No, it's OK.”

How long will National Guard troops will stay in Los Angeles?

“Until there's no danger,” Trump said. “When there's no danger, they'll leave.”

The president during his Oval Office engagement with reporters left open the possibility of invoking one the most extreme emergency powers available to a U.S. president.

“If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We'll see,” Trump said. “But I can tell you last night was terrible , and the night before that was terrible.”

The Insurrection Act authorizes the president to deploy military forces inside the United States to suppress rebellion or domestic violence or to enforce the law in certain situations.

It is often referred to as the “Insurrection Act of 1807,” but the law is actually an amalgamation of different statutes enacted by Congress between 1792 and 1871.

The president told reporters in the Oval Office that he wants the country to “wean off” of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 

Trump has been critical of FEMA over the last year and has spread misinformation about it, especially regarding its assistance in North Carolina in the wake of Hurricane Helene.

Trump said disaster management is meant to be handled by governors.

“We're moving it back to the states so the governors can handle it,” he said. “That's why they're governors. Now, if they can't handle it, they shouldn't be governor.”

Trump last month pushed out the acting head of FEMA after the administrator testified before Congress that he disagreed with dismantling the agency.

The event wasn't on Trump's public schedule, but the Agriculture and Homeland Security secretaries talked about fighting wildfires and hurricanes.

Trump is sitting at his desk while the officials talk.

The president has cut firefighting crews and also wants to eliminate FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Administration and give states more responsibility for responding to hurricanes.

Sanders, who was press secretary in Trump's first term, is meeting with administration officials at the White House.

She backs Trump sending the National Guard into Los Angeles without approval from California's governor and was asked if she'd be OK with a similar move in her state.

“If we needed help, I would be making the phone call myself to the president and asking for his assistance. But in Arkansas, we would never allow to take place what they're letting to go on in California. But if we needed help, the president would be one of the first people I would call because he is somebody I know who cares deeply about making sure the American people are safe and secure first and foremost.”

And she says she's working to speed up the delivery of the intelligence information to address a key complaint from policy makers.

Speaking at the Amazon Web Services summit in Washington, Gabbard said the pace of intelligence work frustrated her as a member of Congress and continues to be a challenge to lawmakers.

“They still express a lot of the same frustrations that I felt — that much of what we were briefed on was already reported in a newspaper … and that even if it was quality reporting it was coming too late,” Gabbard said.

Artificial intelligence and computing could help speed up the work, Gabbard said, to ensure lawmakers have the information they need.

“We stated very publicly that it's 60 days because we want to ensure that those rioters, looters and thugs on the other side assaulting our police officers know that we're not going anywhere,” Hegseth told members of the House appropriations defense subcommittee.

Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, right, accompanied by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine, testifies before the House Committee on Appropriations subcommittee oversight hearing on the Department of Defense, on Capitol Hill.



The current cost estimate for the deployment is $134 million, which is largely just the cost of travel, housing and food,” said Bryn Woollacott MacDonnell, special assistant to the secretary of defense who's currently performing the duties of the Pentagon's top financial officer.

That could mean Kyiv will receive fewer critical air defense systems in the future that have been key to countering a continuous onslaught of Russian missiles.

“It is a reduction in this budget,” Hegseth told lawmakers. “This administration takes a very different view of that conflict. We believe that a negotiated peaceful settlement is in the best interest of both parties and our nation's interests, especially with all the competing interests around the globe.”

The U.S. to date has provided Ukraine more than $66 billion in aid since Russia invaded in February 2022.

And he echoed the president's attacks on Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

“That's not my lane,” Johnson said in response to a question about whether Newsom should face legal consequences such as arrest.

Johnson, speaking at a news conference at the RNC on Tuesday, continued that Newsom should be “tarred and feathered”— eliciting chuckles from members of House Republican leadership at the news conference — for “standing in the way of the administration and the carrying out of federal law.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Tuesday there were “clear failures on the part of state and local officials” in response to protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles and a “federal response” was necessary.

President Trump has sent thousands of National Guard troops and 700 active duty Marines to quell the protests despite the objections of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and local leaders.

“I don't know exactly the authorities that they are using,” Thune said, referring to the Marine deployment. “But obviously, there was a security situation out there that needed to be addressed. And I think ultimately the president's objective is to keep people safe.”

“I think we're entering another phase, especially under President Trump with his focus on the homeland, where the National Guard and reserves become a critical component of how we secure that homeland,” Hegseth told lawmakers.

Hegseth earlier refused to answer a lawmaker's questions on how much a deployment of active duty U.S. Marines to Los Angeles will cost.

After the activist joined a flotilla seeking to break Israel's blockade of Gaza and bring humanitarian aid to Palestinians, the U.S. president described Thunberg as a ''young, angry person.'' He said she should go to ''anger management class.''

Thunberg was detained then deported by Israel on Tuesday and sent to Paris.

Asked upon arrival about Trump's comments, she replied in a matter-of-fact tone: “I think the world needs a lot more young angry women to be honest. Especially with everything going on right now.”

Gen. Eric Smith testified at a budget hearing before senators that those Marines are trained for crowd control and they would have shields and batons as their equipment. He said they have no arrest authority and are only there to protect federal property and federal personnel.

When asked by Sen. Richard Blumental, a Connecticut Democrat, about the danger Marines would use lethal force that could result in injuries and deaths, Smith said he had faith in them.

“I am not concerned. I have great faith in my Marines and their junior leaders and their more senior leaders to execute the lawful tasks that they are given.”

The attack in early June that destroyed a large number of Russian bomber aircraft caught the U.S. off guard and represented significant advances in drone warfare, Hegseth told lawmakers Tuesday.

The attack has the Pentagon rethinking drone defenses “so we are not vulnerable to a threat and an attack like that,” Hegseth told the House appropriations subcommittee on defense.

Hegseth said the Pentagon “is learning everyday from Ukraine,” and focused on how to better defend its own military airfields.

In a back an forth with the defense appropriations subcommittee's top Democrat, Hegseth refused to answer basic questions on the cost of deploying Marines to Los Angeles, instead falling back on political talking points.

In a series of questions on the news that Marines would be sent to Los Angeles, House Appropriations defense subcommittee ranking member Rep. Betty McCollum told Hegseth “this is a deeply unfair position to put our Marines in,” she said. “There's no need for the Marines to be deployed.”

McCollum asked what the cost of the deployment would be. Hegseth deflected on the costs, attacked the decisions of the previous Biden administration instead and talked about illegal immigration.

“Could the Secretary please address the budget” McCollum asked him.

Hegseth again refused to acknowledge McCollum's question and attacked the politics of the past administration again. McCollum took back her time and Hegseth was instructed by the committee chairman to provide the costs in writing instead.

Democratic members of California's congressional delegation are accusing the president of creating a “manufactured crisis” in Los Angeles with his orders to send in thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines.

“It's a deliberate attempt by Trump to incite unrest, test the limits of executive power and distract from the lawlessness of his administration,” said Rep. Jimmy Gomez, who organized a news conference at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday morning.

Rep. Jimmy Panetta said Trump's decision to send in the military was designed to “give him the image and give him the fight and give him the pictures that he wants.“

Rep. Nancy Pelosi contrasted Trump's actions now with his handling of the Jan. 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol when law enforcement officers were being beaten.

“We begged the president of the United States to send in the National Guard. He would not do it,” Pelosi said.

Based on his opening remarks in his first appearance before lawmakers since taking office, there's been nothing but smooth sailing in the defense chief's office.

Hegseth completed his opening statement with no mention of his controversial use of Signal, of the lack of defense budget details to guide Congress, or his controversial firings of his own staff or military leaders.

Hegseth also made no mention of a decision to deploy Marines into Los Angeles to respond to immigration raid protests. Instead, he clung closely to the talking points he's used since taking office, such as emphasizing that “DEI is dead,” and that he's focused on a return to “lethality.”

Trump's defense chief faced a litany of questions on what some lawmakers called “rash” or “reckless” decisions or actions dating back to his first day in office, as Tuesday's hearing before the House Appropriations defense subcommittee began.

In opening statements, lawmakers asked about Hegseth's decisions to fire top military leaders, his use of Signal and other controversies, including his firing of several staff members in his inner circle.

“The Department of Defense is mired in controversy and chaos,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the ranking member of the full committee.

President Trump's trade wars are expected to slash economic growth this year in the United States and around the world, the World Bank forecast Tuesday.

Citing “a substantial rise in trade barriers'' but without mentioning Trump by name, the 189-country lender predicted that the U.S. economy — the world's largest — would grow half as fast (1.4%) this year as it did in 2024 (2.8%). That marked a downgrade from the 2.3% U.S. growth it had forecast back for 2025 back in January.

The bank also lopped 0.4 percentage points off its forecast for global growth this year. It now expects the world economy to expand just 2.3% in 2025, down from 2.8% in 2024.

Trump said his decision to “SEND IN THE TROOPS” to Los Angeles spared the city from burning to the ground like thousands of homes after wildfires this year.

He wrote on his social media site that people want to rebuild, and that the federal permitting process is “virtually complete on these houses.”

Trump claimed “the easy and simple City and State Permits are disastrously bungled up and WAY BEHIND SCHEDULE!” and blamed California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.

“People want to rebuild their houses. Call your incompetent Governor and Mayor, the Federal permitting is DONE!!!” he wrote.



He's expected to field sharp questions from members of Congress about his tumultuous start as Pentagon chief, including his sharing of sensitive military details over a Signal chat, in three separate Capitol Hill hearings beginning Tuesday.

Lawmakers also have made it clear they're unhappy that Hegseth hasn't provided details on the administration's first proposed defense budget, which Trump has said would total $1 trillion, a significant increase over the current spending level of more than $800 billion.

It will be lawmakers' first chance to ask Hegseth about a myriad of other controversial spending by the Pentagon, including plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on security upgrades to turn a Qatari jet into Air Force One and to pour as much as $45 million into a parade recently added to the Army's 250th birthday bash, which happens to coincide with Trump's birthday on Saturday.

Kennedy on Monday removed every member of a scientific committee that advises the CDC on how to use vaccines and pledged to replace them with his own picks.

Major physicians and public health groups criticized the move to oust all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

Kennedy, who was one of the nation's leading anti-vaccine activists before becoming the nation's top health official, has not said who he would appoint to the panel, but said it would convene in just two weeks in Atlanta.

Although it's typically not viewed as a partisan board, the entire current roster of committee members were Biden appointees.

Trump made no secret of his willingness to take a maximalist approach to enforcing immigration laws and keeping order as he campaigned to return to the White House. The fulfillment of that pledge is now on full display in Los Angeles.

By overriding California's Gov. Gavin Newsom, Trump is already going beyond what he did to respond to Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, when he warned he could send troops to contain demonstrations that turned violent if governors in the states did not act to do so themselves. Trump said in September of that year that he “can't call in the National Guard unless we're requested by a governor” and that “we have to go by the laws.”

But now, he's moving swiftly to test the bounds of his executive authority in order to deliver on his promise of mass deportations. What remains to be seen is whether Americans will stand by him once it's operationalized nationwide. For now, Trump is betting that they will.

Trump plans to speak at Fort Bragg on Tuesday to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army as he deploys the military in an attempt to quiet immigration protests in Los Angeles.

Fort Bragg, located near Fayetteville, North Carolina, serves as headquarters for U.S. Army Special Operations Command. Highly trained units like the Green Berets and the Rangers are based there.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll will also be at Tuesday's event, along with service members, veterans and their families.

Trump has promoted the Army's anniversary as a reason to hold a military parade in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, which is also his 79th birthday.

Trump, who sees the military as a critical tool for domestic goals, has used the recent protests in Los Angeles as an opportunity to deploy the National Guard and U.S. Marines to quell disturbances that began as protests over immigration raids.

President Donald Trump has authorized the deployment of an additional 2,000 National Guard members to respond to immigration protests in Los Angeles, according to the Pentagon's chief spokesperson. Mayor Karen Bass criticized the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines as a “deliberate attempt” by the Trump administration to “create disorder and chaos in our city.”

Marines and additional National Guard troops headed to the Los Angeles area on Tuesday, sent in by President Donald Trump in response to protests over immigration raids despite the objections of the governor and local leaders.

The authorization came amid mostly peaceful protests in the country's second-largest city on Monday. Additional protests against immigration raids are expected to continue in other cities Tuesday.

Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis said four officers who were injured during Monday night's protests have been treated and released from a hospital by Tuesday. 

Three officers were hurt by what she described as “very large” rocks that were thrown at police. The fourth officer injured a shoulder while making an arrest. 

Davis said Austin police deployed pepper spray balls and that state police used tear gas to disperse the crowd once it started to turn violent. Davis said her department is prepared for protests that are planned for downtown Austin this upcoming weekend.

“We support peaceful protest,” Davis said. “When that protests turn violent, when it turns to throwing rocks and bottles .... That will not be tolerated. Arrests will be made.”

Rep. David Valadao, a moderate Republican who represents much of the state's San Joaquin Valley, urged for peaceful protest and said he was also concerned over how the Trump administration is conducting ICE raids in the Golden state.

“I support the First Amendment right to peacefully protest, but the violence and vandalism happening in Los Angeles is unacceptable and I stand with our law enforcement officers working to protect people and regain control over the situation,” Valadao wrote on social media.

“I remain concerned about ongoing ICE operations throughout CA and will continue my conversations with the administration—urging them to prioritize the removal of known criminals over the hardworking people who have lived peacefully in the Valley for years,” he added.

Viral social media posts are claiming that a Craigslist ad seeking “the toughest badasses in the city” is proof that the Los Angeles demonstrations are made up of paid protestors.

But this is false.

The ad, which is no longer live, was bait for a prank show called “Goofcon1"" and had nothing to do with the protests in Los Angeles. It was posted on Craigslist on Thursday, the day before the protests began. 

In a livestreamed episode, the show's hosts on Friday called and spoke with people who responded to the ad. Joey LaFleur, one of Goofcon1's hosts, confirmed with The Associated Press that he put up the Craigslist ad for the show.

“I literally had no idea it was ever going to be connected to the riots. It was a really weird coincidence,” he said, referencing the ad. “I'm not trying to troll a serious situation.”

It is often referred to as the “Insurrection Act of 1807,” but the law is actually an amalgamation of different statutes enacted by Congress between 1792 and 1871.

About 50 people gathered outside the immigration court in downtown Seattle on Tuesday, chanting with drums and holding up signs that said “Free Them All Abolish ICE” and “No to Deportations.” 

Legal advocates who normally attend the immigration court hearings as observers and to provide support to immigrants were not allowed inside the building. Security guards also turned away the media. 

The hearings are normally open to the public. Organizers said they were there solidarity with protesters in Los Angeles. 

The protest was peaceful and there were no law-enforcement officers in the area in the morning. 

Although most have been peaceful with marchers chanting and carrying signs, some have resulted in dozens of arrests.

The demonstrations have ranged from gatherings outside of federal office buildings or state capitol buildings, and marches through the downtown of several major cities. A series of so-called “No Kings” rallies were planned Saturday to coincide with President Trump's scheduled military parade in Washington, DC.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on social media on Tuesday that the agency would continue its program of raids and deportations despite the protests.

“ICE will continue to enforce the law,” Noem posted on X.

In Santa Ana, California, armored vehicles blocked the road Tuesday morning leading into the Civic Center, where federal immigration officers and numerous city and county agencies have their offices. 

Workers swept up plastic bottles and broken glass. Tiny shards of red, black and purple glass littered the pavement. 

Nearby buildings and the sidewalk were tagged with graffiti containing obscenities and Trump's name crossed out. A worker rolled paint over graffiti on a wall to block it out. National Guard officers wearing fatigues and carrying rifles prevented people from entering the area unless they worked there.

A handful of National Guard members are stationed in front of the Metropolitan Detention Center, long guns and wood sticks slung over their shoulders. Occasionally, a passing driver will honk at or heckle them, drawing no response. 

News crews are stationed on the opposite side of the street, awaiting the possible arrival of the U.S. Marines. Otherwise, there are few signs of the tumult that has gripped the city in recent nights, aside from the graffiti scrawled across several buildings – “Abolish ICE,” “Amerikkka,” and obscene slogans directed at Trump and federal law enforcement. 

At the Walt Disney Concert Hall, workers were busy washing away the graffiti on Tuesday morning.

The deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles will cost at least $134 million and last at least the next 60 days, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and a senior defense official told lawmakers Tuesday.

“We stated very publicly that it's 60 days because we want to ensure that those rioters, looters and thugs on the other side assaulting our police officers know that we're not going anywhere,” Hegseth told members of the House appropriations defense subcommittee.

After persistent questioning from members of Congress, Hegseth turned to his acting comptroller, Bryn Woollacott MacDonnell, who provided the total and said this “is largely just the cost of travel, housing and food.”

She said the money will come from operations and maintenance accounts.

House Speaker Mike Johnson defended Donald Trump's handling of protests in Los Angeles and echoed the president's attacks on Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.

“That's not my lane,” Johnson said in response to a question about whether Newsom should face legal consequences such as arrest.

Johnson, speaking at a news conference at the RNC on Tuesday, continued that Newsom should be “tarred and feathered”-- eliciting chuckles from members of House Republican leadership at the press conference -- for “standing in the way of the administration and the carrying out of federal law.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Tuesday there were “clear failures on the part of state and local officials” in response to protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles and a “federal response” was necessary.

President Trump has sent thousands of National Guard troops and 700 active duty Marines to quell the protests despite the objections of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and local leaders.

“I don't know exactly the authorities that they are using,” Thune said, referring to the Marine deployment. “But obviously, there was a security situation out there that needed to be addressed. And I think ultimately the president's objective is to keep people safe.”



The commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Eric Smith, said the battalion deployed to Los Angeles is already there and ready to follow the orders from the U.S. Northern Command, but clarified they have not yet been called to respond. 

Smith testified at a budget hearing before senators that those Marines are trained for crowd control, and they would have shields and batons as their equipment. He said they have no arrest authority, and are only there to protect federal property and federal personnel.

When asked by U.S. Sen. Richard Blumental, a Connecticut Democrat, about the danger that Marines would use lethal force that could result in injuries and deaths, Smith said he had faith in them.

“I am not concerned. I have great faith in my Marines and their junior leaders and their more senior leaders to execute the lawful tasks that they are given.”

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott posted on social media that “more than a dozen protesters” were arrested by city and state police in Austin.

“Peaceful protesting is legal,” Abbott, a Republican, posted on X. “But once you cross the line, you will be arrested.”

Hundreds of protestors organized by the Austin chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation gathered near the Capitol on Monday, and moved toward the federal building that houses an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office. State officials had closed the Capitol to the public an hour earlier than usual head of the demonstration.

In Dallas, hundreds of demonstrators gathered for a rally on a city bridge for several hours before police later determined the rally to be “unlawful.” Dallas police said one person was arrested and charges were pending.

DeSantis has often clashed with California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who like DeSantis is a term-limited governor with national ambitions.

“You don't have the right to just simply opt out of federal immigration law. And I think what's happened in California is they're a sanctuary state. They've taken the position really uninterrupted for many, many years that they can just ignore the law, they don't have to cooperate. Well now you have the law being applied,” DeSantis said at a Florida Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

DeSantis said law enforcement officers in Florida are ready to crack down if demonstrations there boil over into riots.

“The minute you cross into attacking law enforcement, any type of rioting, any type of vandalism, looting, just be prepared to have the law come down on you,” DeSantis added. “And we will make an example of you, you can guarantee it.”

In a back an forth with the defense appropriations subcommittee's top Democrat, Hegseth refused to answer basic questions on the cost of deploying Marines to Los Angeles, instead falling back on political talking points.

In a series of questions on the news that Marines would be sent to Los Angeles, House Appropriations defense subcommittee ranking member Rep. Betty McCollum told Hegseth “this is a deeply unfair position to put our Marines in,” she said. “There's no need for the Marines to be deployed.”

McCollum asked what the cost of the deployment would be. Hegseth deflected on the costs, attacked the decisions of the previous Biden administration instead and talked about illegal immigration.

“Could the Secretary please address the budget” McCollum asked him.

Hegseth again refused to acknowledge McCollum's question and attacked the politics of the past administration again. 

McCollum took back her time and Hegseth was instructed by the committee chairman to provide the costs in writing instead.

Democratic members of California's congressional delegation are accusing Trump of creating a “manufactured crisis” in Los Angeles with his orders to send in thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines.

“It's a deliberate attempt by Trump to incite unrest, test the limits of executive power and distract from the lawlessness of his administration,” said Rep. Jimmy Gomez, who organized a press conference at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday morning.

Rep. Jimmy Panetta said that Trump's decision to send the military was designed to “give him the image and give him the fight and give him the pictures that he wants.“ Panetta said the delegation would stand with peaceful protesters, but those who are not peaceful are going to pay the consequences.

Rep. Nancy Pelosi contrasted Trump's actions now with his handling of the Jan. 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol when law enforcement officers were being beaten.

“We begged the president of the United States to send in the National Guard. He would not do it,” Pelosi said.

Trump said his decision to “SEND IN THE TROOPS” to Los Angeles spared the city from burning to the ground like thousands of homes after wildfires this year.

He wrote on his social media site that people want to rebuild, and that the federal permitting process is “virtually complete on these houses.”

Trump claimed that “the easy and simple City and State Permits are disastrously bungled up and WAY BEHIND SCHEDULE!” and blamed California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.

“People want to rebuild their houses. Call your incompetent Governor and Mayor, the Federal permitting is DONE!!!” he wrote.

The Pentagon was scrambling Monday to establish rules to guide U.S. Marines who could be faced with the rare and difficult prospect of using force against citizens on American soil, now that the Trump administration is deploying active duty troops to the immigration raid protests in Los Angeles.

The forces have been trained in deescalation, crowd control and standing rules for the use of force, Northern Command said.

But the use of the active duty forces still raises difficult questions.

The Marines are highly trained in combat and crisis response. But that is starkly different from the role they will face now: They could potentially be hit by protesters carrying gas canisters and have to quickly decide how to respond or face decisions about protecting an immigration enforcement agent from crowds.

According to a U.S. official, troops will be armed with their normal service weapons but will not be carrying tear gas. They also will have protective equipment such as helmets, shields and gas masks.

This isn't the image Los Angeles wanted projected around the globe.

Clouds of tear gas wafting over a throng of protesters on a blocked freeway. Federal immigration agents in tactical garb raiding businesses in search of immigrants without legal status. A messy war of words between Trump and Newsom. Photos captured several Waymo robotaxis set on fire and graffiti scrawled on a federal detention center building, while videos recorded the sounds of rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades hitting crowds.

In a city still reeling from January's deadly wildfires — and with the World Cup soccer championships and the 2028 Olympics on the horizon — Mayor Karen Bass has been urging residents to come together to revitalize LA's image by sprucing up streets, planting trees and painting murals so LA shows its best face to nations near and far.

“It's about pride,” she's said. “This is the city of dreams.”

The deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.

The last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

In a directive Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”

On Monday, thousands flooded the streets around City Hall for a union rally ahead of a hearing for arrested labor leader David Huerta, who was freed a few hours later on a $50,000 bond. Huerta's arrest Friday while protesting immigration raids has become a rallying cry for people angry over the administration's crackdown. He is the president of the Service Employees International Union California, which represents thousands of the state's janitors, security officers and other workers.

Early protests had a calm and even joyful atmosphere at times, with people dancing to live music and buoyed by Huerta's release.

Protesters linked hands in front of a line of police officers outside the downtown federal detention center where Huerta was being held. Religious leaders joined the protesters, working with organizers at times to de-escalate moments of tension.

There was a heavy law enforcement presence in the few square blocks, while most in the immense city of some 4 million people went about their normal business on peaceful streets.

Another 2,000 National Guard troops along with 700 Marines are headed to Los Angeles on orders from President Donald Trump, escalating a military presence local officials and Newsom don't want and the police chief says creates logistical challenges for safely handling protests.

An initial 2,000 Guard troops ordered by Trump started arriving Sunday, which saw the most violence during three days of protests.

Monday's demonstrations were far less raucous, with thousands peacefully attending a rally at City Hall and hundreds protesting outside a federal complex that includes a detention center where some immigrants are being held following workplace raids across the city.

Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth. They say he is putting public safety at risk by adding military personnel even though police say they don't need the help.

Newsom called the deployments reckless and “disrespectful to our troops” in a post on the social platform X.

Another 2,000 National Guard troops along with 700 Marines are headed to Los Angeles on orders from President Donald Trump, escalating a military presence local officials have said creates logistical challenges for safely handling protests.

Protests were held in Austin and Dallas, Texas over immigration raids in Los Angeles.

President Donald Trump has authorized the deployment of an additional 2,000 National Guard members to respond to immigration protests in Los Angeles, according to the Pentagon's chief spokesperson. Mayor Karen Bass criticized the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines as a “deliberate attempt” by the Trump administration to “create disorder and chaos in our city.”

California officials are filing a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump in response to the administration's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard to confront immigration protesters in the streets in Los Angeles.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Marines that deployed to Los Angeles on orders from President Donald Trump have not yet been called to respond to the city's immigration protests and are there only to protect federal officials and property, the Marine Corps commandant said Tuesday.

The 700 Marines and another 2,000 National Guard troops were sent to LA on Monday, escalating a military presence that local officials and Gov. Gavin Newsom do not want and that the police chief says makes it harder to handle the protests safely.

Marine Corps Gen. Eric Smith told a budget hearing on Capitol Hill that the battalion has not yet been sent to any protests. The Marines were trained for crowd control but have no arrest authority and are there to protect government property and personnel, he said.

Trump doubled the number of Guard troops being deployed soon after the first wave of 2,000 began arriving Sunday following days of protests driven by anger over the president's stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws that critics say are breaking apart migrant families.

The demonstrations continued Monday but were far less raucous, with thousands of people peacefully attending a rally at City Hall and hundreds more protesting outside a federal complex that includes a detention center where some immigrants are being held following workplace raids across the city.

The protests in Los Angeles, a city of 4 million people, have largely been centered in several blocks of downtown and a few other spots. At daybreak Tuesday, guard troops were stationed outside the detention center, but there was no sign of the Marines.




Obscene slogans directed at Trump and federal law enforcement remained scrawled across several buildings. At the Walt Disney Concert Hall, workers were busy washing away graffiti Tuesday morning.

In nearby Santa Ana, armored vehicles blocked a road leading to federal immigration and government offices. Workers swept up plastic bottles and broken glass near buildings sprayed with graffiti.

Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth. They say he is putting public safety at risk by adding military personnel even though police say they don't need the help.

Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a statement that he was confident in the police department's ability to handle large-scale demonstrations and that the Marines' arrival without coordinating with the police department would present a “significant logistical and operational challenge.”




Newsom called the deployments reckless and “disrespectful to our troops” in a post on the social platform X.

“This isn't about public safety,” the governor said. “It's about stroking a dangerous President's ego.”

The protests began Friday after federal immigration authorities arrested more than 40 people across Los Angeles and continued over the weekend as crowds blocked a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire. Police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades.

Demonstrations spread Monday to other cities nationwide, including San Francisco and Santa Ana, California, as well as Dallas and Austin, Texas. Authorities in Austin appeared to use chemical irritants to disperse a crowd that gathered near the state Capitol. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott posted on social media that more than a dozen protesters were arrested.

The Pentagon said deploying the National Guard and Marines costs $134 million. That figure came out Tuesday just after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth engaged in a into a testy back-and-forth about the costs during a congressional hearing.

Hegseth said the department has a budget increase and the money to cover the costs, and he defended Trump's decision to send the troops, saying they are needed to protect federal agents doing their jobs.

Meanwhile, Democratic members of California's congressional delegation on Tuesday accused the president of creating a “manufactured crisis” with his orders to send in troops.

Rep. Nancy Pelosi contrasted Trump's actions with his handling of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol when law enforcement officers were beaten. “We begged the president of the United States to send in the National Guard. He would not do it,” Pelosi said.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the use of National Guard troops following the first deployment, telling reporters that Trump had “trampled” the state's sovereignty. He sought a court order declaring Trump's use of the Guard unlawful and asking for a restraining order to halt the deployment.

Trump said the city would have been “completely obliterated” if he had not deployed the Guard.

U.S. officials said the Marines were needed to protect federal buildings and personnel, including immigration agents. A convoy of buses with blacked-out windows and escorted by sheriff's vehicles arrived overnight at a Navy facility just south of LA.

Despite their presence, there has been limited engagement so far between the Guard and protesters while local law enforcement implements crowd control.

Thousands flooded the streets around City Hall for a union rally Monday before labor leader David Huerta was freed on a bond after he was arrested Friday while protesting the immigration raids.

The detention of Heurta, president of the Service Employees International Union California, became a rallying cry for people angry over the crackdown.

As the crowd thinned, police began pushing protesters away from the area, firing crowd-control munitions as people chanted, “Peaceful protest.” At least a dozen people were surrounded by police and detained.

Several dozen people were arrested throughout the weekend. Authorities say one was detained Sunday for throwing a Molotov cocktail at police and another for ramming a motorcycle into a line of officers.

The deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.

The last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

In a directive Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”

President Donald Trump warned rioters in Los Angeles that his administration is ""not playing around"" as U.S. Marines prepare to deploy to the city Tuesday.

Trump made the statement during an exchange with reporters, adding that he had called California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday and criticized his handling of the riots.

""A day ago, I called him up to tell him got to do a better job. He's done a bad job causing a lot of death and a lot of a lot of potential death,"" Trump said of Newsom.


""If we didn't send out the National Guard and us night, we gave him a little additional help. Los Angeles would be burning right now. Los Angeles would be not a lot different than what you saw take place in California, in Los Angeles just a little while ago,"" he added, referring to this year's wildfires.

Trump went on to describe the rioters as ""animals,"" and argued they are paid agitators rather than real protesters.

""They look in your face and they spit right in your face. They're animals. And these are paid insurrectionists. These are paid troublemakers that agitators. They're paid,"" Trump said. ""These are paid insurrectionist or agitator or troublemakers. You can call it whatever you want. And we ended it, and we have in custody some very bad people, some very bad people.""





Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
 was brutally mocked by critics over a ""delusional"" X post describing the anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles as ""peaceful demonstrations"" while pinning blame on President Donald Trump for sowing ""chaos"" in southern California.

""Comments off lol. She can't handle the ratio. This is what Hillary Clinton calls 'peaceful demonstrations,'"" popular conservative X account Libs of TikTok posted, referring to how comments on Clinton's post were restricted to only permit ones from accounts Clinton follows on the social media platform and accompanied by footage of the destruction in LA. 

The message was in response to Clinton posting her first and only comment as of Tuesday morning regarding the Los Angeles riots, describing them as ""peaceful demonstrations"" before Trump mobilized the National Guard over the weekend. 


""California Governor Newsom didn't request the National Guard be deployed to his state following peaceful demonstrations. Trump sent them anyway,"" Clinton posted on X. ""It's the first time in 60 years a president has made that choice. Trump's goal isn't to keep Californians safe. His goal is to cause chaos, because chaos is good for Trump.""  

The comment sparked widespread backlash among critics, who repeatedly urged the former first lady to ""shut up"" and accused her of turning off comments to the post amid the backlash. 

""Ever notice that only leftists disable comments?"" California Republican Liberty Caucus chair John Dennis posted in response to Clinton. 

Social media users were able to respond to Clinton through quote engagements, but not through direct replies as of Tuesday morning.

""These are not peaceful Hillary,"" Florida Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna posted to X. 


""A public figure and a fraud like herself shouldn't be able to lock her replies, @elonmusk,"" one person responded on X, tagging X owner Elon Musk.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth doubled down on the decision to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles on Tuesday.

Hegseth made the statement during a hearing before the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday.

""In Los Angeles, we believe that ICE, which is a federal law enforcement agency, has the right to safely conduct operations in any state, in any jurisdiction in the country, especially after 21 million illegals have crossed our border under the previous administration. Ice ought be able to do its job, whether it's Minneapolis or Los Angeles,"" Hegseth told lawmakers.

Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense Bryn MacDonnell testified later Tuesday that the cost of the deployment is expected to be $134 million.


Hegseth's comments came as House Speaker Mike Johnson addressed reporters alongside Republican leadership at the Capitol. Johnson lashed out at California Gov. Gavin Newsom, saying he needs to do his job.

""He is applauding the bad guys and standing in the way of the good guys. He is trying to. He is he's a a participant in accomplice and our federal law enforcement agents being not just disrespected but assaulted. This is a serious problem. And, the governor is now filing a lawsuit against the president. What a joke. Do your job, man. That's what I tell Gavin Newsom. Do your job. Stop working on your rebranding and be a governor,"" Johnson said.





FIRST ON FOX: California GOP Congressman Darrell Issa
 is calling for an investigation into allegations that the Los Angeles Police Department did not promptly respond to protect ICE officers being assaulted as violence broke out in the city on Friday night. 

Issa, who represents California's 48th Congressional District and is a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a press release Tuesday he is calling for a ""full and complete Congressional investigation"" into the response time of the LAPD assisting the ICE officers who, according to a press release from DHS, waited for two hours for assistance. 

""Last night, over 1,000 rioters surrounded a federal law enforcement building and assaulted ICE law enforcement officers, slashed tires, defaced buildings, and taxpayer funded property,"" DHS said in a press release on Saturday, referring to the previous night when violence broke out in Los Angeles in response to the ICE raids. 

""It took the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) 2 hours to respond.""

LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell, who quickly put out a press release Friday reassuring the public that the department does not participate in immigration activities, pushed back against DHS' claim in a Sunday press conference. 

""When we heard that, I think anybody who's a police officer couldn't believe it, and certainly anyone with LAPD couldn't imagine how that could happen,"" McDonnell said to reporters. ""Well, it didn't happen.""

McDonnell claimed that the actual response time was 40 minutes due to traffic. 

This is an excerpt from an article by Fox News' Andrew Mark Miller





Sen. John Fetterman,
 D-Pa., spoke out against the ""anarchy and true chaos"" in Los Angeles, declaring that Democrats forfeit ""moral high ground"" if they do not decry the violence.

""I unapologetically stand for free speech, peaceful demonstrations, and immigration—but this is not that. This is anarchy and true chaos. My party loses the moral high ground when we refuse to condemn setting cars on fire, destroying buildings, and assaulting law enforcement,"" Fetterman declared in a post on X.

Elon Musk replied to Fetterman's post with an American flag emoji.

Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy noted, ""It's hard to preach hard truths to your own side. I respect this.""


Deputy White House chief of staff and Cabinet secretary Taylor Budowich responded to Fetterman in a post, writing: ""This is a wake up call for many Democrats: there is no room for you in the party of @GavinNewsom and @KamalaHarris. Their self-obsessed pursuits of power are blind to you and your concerns. They defend chaos, reject biology, and are unbothered by the invasion of our nation.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has spoken out against violence, declaring in a post on X, ""Dr. King defeated racist government officials & ended segregation through disciplined non-violent resistance. Defeating Trumpism, oligarchy & authoritarianism requires that same level of discipline. Violent protests are counterproductive and play right into Trump's playbook.""

President Donald Trump has deployed National Guard troops in response to the unrest in LA.

""We made a great decision in sending the National Guard to deal with the violent, instigated riots in California. If we had not done so, Los Angeles would have been completely obliterated,"" the president asserted on Monday in a Truth Social post.





MSNBC reporter Jacob Soboroff described illegal immigrants as the ""fabric"" of Los Angeles as anti-ICE protests and riots entered their fourth day on Monday.

Soboroff spoke outside a Home Depot store in the city, which he described as one of the locations where U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested several suspects during a raid.


He called the operation ""unprecedented"" and claimed on ""Deadline: White House"" that going after the undocumented community is what inspired the protests that devolved into violent riots over the weekend.

""The big picture is Los Angeles is a so-called majority-minority city in a majority-minority state,"" Soboroff said. ""There are more people of color that live in Los Angeles than White people at this point. And many of those people are undocumented. By some counts, 10% of the population of L.A. County, one of the largest counties, the largest county by population in the United States, is undocumented, maybe as many as a million people."" 


He added, ""Those people are our neighbors, our coworkers, our classmates, our friends, our parishioners, fellow parishioners, and churches. They are part of the fabric of the city of Los Angeles.""

Soboroff condemned the arrests as ""family separation in the interior,"" adding that ""mass deportation is family separation.""

""It's taking parents away from their children, not at the border and not in detention centers, but at a Home Depot on a street corner or outside of a school, or at a workplace in the fashion district where they might be working in a factory. It's a different form of family separation, and it's exactly the intent of this administration,"" Soboroff said.

Fox News' Lindsay Kornick contributed to this report





President Donald Trump
 argued that Los Angeles would be ""burning to the ground"" if he hadn't ordered National Guard troops to intervene against anti-ICE riots in recent days.

Trump made the statement from his personal Truth Social account on Tuesday morning, going on to attack California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass for their handling of recent wildfires.


""If I didn't 'SEND IN THE TROOPS' to Los Angeles the last three nights, that once beautiful and great City would be burning to the ground right now, much like 25,000 houses burned to the ground in L.A. do to an incompetent Governor and Mayor - Incidentally, the much more difficult, time consuming, and stringent FEDERAL PERMITTING PROCESS is virtually complete on these houses, while the easy and simple City and State Permits are disastrously bungled up and WAY BEHIND SCHEDULE! They are a total mess, and will be for a long time. People want to rebuild their houses. Call your incompetent Governor and Mayor, the Federal permitting is DONE!!!"" Trump wrote.





Rioters waving Mexican flags shouted slogans like ""No justice, no peace,"" and ""Don't start no sh—, won't be no sh—"" on the corner of 2nd St. and San Pedro Street during Monday night protests in Los Angeles.

Protesters could be seen waving Mexican flags as the barred access to the street corner.

The anti-ICE protests continued in California's largest city throughout Monday night and into Tuesday, when U.S. Marines sent by President Donald Trump
 are expected to deploy.





Media outlets and elected Democrats have made the rounds in recent days, often using the word ""peaceful"" to describe the anti-ICE unrest in Los Angeles over the weekend despite rioting and violence that has resulted in destruction and injured police officers, a video review by Fox News Digital finds.

""The vast majority of protesters and demonstrators are peaceful,"" Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., said recently on MSNBC. ""They're passionate.""

""A lot of these peaceful protests are being generated because the president of the United States is sowing chaos,"" Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said on Sunday's ""Meet the Press"" on NBC.

On CNN, a California Democrat House member said she doesn't know what the ""so-called"" violence is ""all about.""


""Well, first of all, it's not even all of downtown,"" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said while downplaying the extent of the violence. ""This is isolated to a few streets, five or 10 streets. This is not city-wide civil unrest like has happened in our city before. But if you watch the pictures, especially on national TV, you would think that the entire city has blown up into unrest, and this is just not true.""

ABC7 Los Angeles anchor Jory Rand cautioned law enforcement from escalating tensions by interfering and said on Sunday that they risked turning ""what is just a bunch of people having fun watching cars burn into a massive confrontation and altercation between officers and demonstrators.""

Rep. Nanette Barragán, a Democrat who represents California's 44th Congressional District, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" program Sunday, ""We are having an administration that's targeting peaceful protests."" 


This is an excerpt from an article by Fox News' Andrew Mark Miller





The Department of Homeland Security is sharing information about more than a dozen illegal immigrant suspects
 accused of crimes in the United States who were arrested in Los Angeles starting on June 6.

The agency released the suspect information after violence broke out in Downtown LA over the weekend in response to the ICE raids that resulted in ""hundreds of illegal aliens [being] arrested by ICE officers and agents,"" including ""many with a criminal history and criminal convictions.""

DHS listed more information about 19 suspects that ICE Los Angeles arrested on June 7 who are accused of crimes ranging from robbery to second-degree murder to rape.

""America's brave ICE officers are removing the worst of the worst from LA's streets, while LA's leaders are working tirelessly against them,"" DHS said in a Sunday statement as riots continued through the weekend. 

Sheriff Chad Bianco of Riverside County said agitators ""are not protesting"" and criticized Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom for not taking appropriate action.

""They are trying to violently influence something by political action. That is what this is. That is everything that the Constitution stands against,"" said Bianco, a Republican who is running for governor. ""That is what law enforcement stands against, and that is what will facilitate the downfall of our civilized society. A civilized society has an adherence to the rule of law, and there is consequence for breaking that social compact. And when politicians encourage this behavior.""


""Governor Newsom needs to put his phone down, go sit in his house behind the comfort of his TV screen and a couch, and be quiet because he is doing nothing but fueling this process,"" the sheriff said. ""He needs to stay out of the way of law enforcement. He knows nothing about this. He knows absolutely nothing about the enforcement of law. He despises the enforcement of law, and he has encouraged this.""

Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., discusses anti-ICE protesters facing off with National Guard troops in Los Angeles on ‘The Ingraham Angle.'

Immigration enforcement efforts in Los Angeles served as the ignition point over the weekend, as coordinated ICE raids across the city sparked violent clashes with law enforcement, leading to the arrival of military forces.

The Trump administration's crackdown culminated in the president's decisive action Monday to deploy a battalion of hundreds of U.S. Marines to respond to anti-immigration enforcement riots, Fox News has learned.

""Approximately 700 Marines with 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division will seamlessly integrate with the Title 10 forces under Task Force 51 who are protecting federal personnel and federal property in the greater Los Angeles area,"" U.S. Northern Command said in a statement.

Assemblyman David Tangipa, R-Calif., called the protests an ""orchestrated attack.""

""Law enforcement is under violent assault—pelted with bricks and weapons by rioters,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""This isn't peaceful protest, it's an orchestrated attack. Organizers aren't just enabling it—they're inciting it. Now, even the Marines are being deployed to restore order.""

""Violence must be condemned and stopped before more lives are put at risk.""

President Donald Trump described the demonstrators as ""violent, insurrectionist mobs"" and praised the 2,000 National Guard troops for their role in restoring order after hoards of protesters clashed with law enforcement in Los Angeles.

Here is a timeline of key events surrounding the immigration enforcement actions and ensuing protests in Los Angeles:

Federal immigration enforcement efforts in Los Angeles began on Friday, June 6, with coordinated ICE raids across the city targeting migrants. These operations, which resulted in more than 100 arrests, focused on known areas of unlawful employment and activity, including the Fashion District and commercial hubs.

Among those arrested was 49-year-old Cuong Chanh Phan, an illegal immigrant from Vietnam with a criminal history that includes a conviction for second-degree murder. Phan was convicted of shooting up a high school graduation party after a dispute, killing an 18-year-old and a 15-year-old. Seven others were injured in the incident, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

One man has already been sent back to Mexico after being picked up at a Home Depot on Friday morning. During the demonstrations, David Huerta, president of SEIU California, a labor union, was arrested and charged with impeding a federal agent while protesting.

Trump deployed California National Guard troops to Los Angeles on Saturday following the chaotic standoff between protesters and federal immigration authorities. Photos from the scene in California captured protesters blocking streets, throwing bricks at law enforcement and setting cars ablaze.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom requested the administration to rescind the deployment, saying Trump is trying ""to manufacture a crisis"" and that the president is ""hoping for chaos so he can justify more crackdowns, more fear, more control.""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized California's Democratic leadership, stating they had ""completely abdicated their responsibility to protect their citizens."" 

She declared that the Trump administration maintains a zero-tolerance policy for criminal behavior and violence, especially when directed at law enforcement officers, and that such individuals ""will be arrested and swiftly brought to justice.""

DHS released a statement on Saturday noting it took the LAPD two hours to respond to the Roybal Federal Building, despite multiple calls.

""Last night, over 1,000 rioters surrounded a federal law enforcement building and assaulted ICE law enforcement officers, slashed tires, defaced buildings, and taxpayer-funded property,"" according to DHS. ""Our ICE enforcement officers are facing a 413% increase in assaults against them. Disturbingly, in recent days, ICE officers' family members have been dox[x]ed and targeted as well.""

Newsom, meanwhile, strongly condemned President Trump's decision to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles without state consent, labeling the move as ""purposefully inflammatory.""

""California – Don't give Donald Trump what he wants,"" Newsom wrote in a X post. ""Speak up. Stay peaceful. Stay calm. Do not use violence and respect the law enforcement officers that are trying their best to keep the peace.""

On Sunday, rioters gathered downtown, including near the Metropolitan Detention Center, to protest ongoing immigration enforcement and the arrival of National Guard personnel. 

Law enforcement agencies, including the LAPD and National Guard troops, employed crowd-control measures such as tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets to disperse protesters.

Newsom arrived in Los Angeles on Sunday evening to oversee the response to the anti-ICE riots and meet with state emergency officials.

""We're here to keep the peace — not play into Trump's political games,"" Newsom wrote.

WATCH: DESTRUCTION TO LAPD HQ

Rioters were seen targeting the LAPD headquarters on Sunday night as violent demonstrations continued. 

The LAPD declared an ""unlawful assembly"" Sunday evening as protesters failed to disperse in the downtown area.

""Agitators have splintered into and through out [sic] the Downtown Area,"" the LAPD's Central Division wrote on X. ""Residents, businesses and visitors to the Downtown Area should be alert and report any criminal activity. Officers are responding to several different locations to disperse crowds.""

DHS on Monday called on California's politicians to ""call off their rioting mob,"" asking why Newsom was supporting what the department called ""foreign criminals.""

The post included a video that shows a masked, shirtless man holding a Mexican flag while standing on top of a vehicle covered in graffiti. A second vehicle is seen burning in the middle of a street as crowds of people gathered nearby.

Newsom continued to spar with Trump over the riots erupting in Los Angeles, calling the president ""unhinged"" on Monday. Newsom has peppered Trump with criticisms over federalizing the National Guard in a series of posts on X.

""We're suing him,"" Newsom added. 

WATCH:

On Monday afternoon, Fox News learned that hundreds of Marines were mobilizing in Los Angeles. They will be tasked with protecting federal property and federal personnel, according to a senior defense official, and the deployment is open-ended. 

The Marines will not be carrying out a law enforcement role, but it Is unclear what their use of force rules are if protesters throw things or spit at them. 

The Marines are from the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines at Twentynine Palms, California. 

Moments before the deployment, Trump expressed optimism that the situation in Los Angeles was improving. 

""I mean, I think we have it very well under control,"" he told reporters. ""I think it would have been a very bad situation. It was heading in the wrong direction. It's now heading in the right direction.""

Newsom expressed his outrage at the possibility of the presence of Marines, writing on X, ""U.S. Marines have served honorably across multiple wars in defense of democracy. They are heroes. They shouldn't be deployed on American soil facing their own countrymen to fulfill the deranged fantasy of a dictatorial President. This is un-American.""

The California governor initially said that the information they have is that Marines are not being deployed, but moving ""from one base to another base.""

""From our understanding, this is moving Marines from one base to another base,"" Newsom wrote in a statement on X. ""At this time, the information we have is that Marines are not being deployed (there is a difference between that and being mobilized),"" he continued.

""The level of escalation is completely unwarranted, uncalled for, and unprecedented — mobilizing the best in class branch of the U.S. military against its own citizens,"" Newsom said.

Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin reports from Los Angeles on anti-ICE rioters facing off with the LAPD on ‘Hannity.'

Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., spoke out against the ""anarchy and true chaos"" in Los Angeles, declaring that Democrats forfeit ""moral high ground"" if they do not decry the violence.

""I unapologetically stand for free speech, peaceful demonstrations, and immigration—but this is not that. This is anarchy and true chaos. My party loses the moral high ground when we refuse to condemn setting cars on fire, destroying buildings, and assaulting law enforcement,"" Fetterman declared in a post on X.

Elon Musk replied to Fetterman's post with an American flag emoji.

Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy noted, ""It's hard to preach hard truths to your own side. I respect this.""

Deputy White House chief of staff and Cabinet secretary Taylor Budowich responded to Fetterman in a post, writing: ""This is a wake up call for many Democrats: there is no room for you in the party of @GavinNewsom and @KamalaHarris.

""We made a great decision in sending the National Guard to deal with the violent, instigated riots in California. If we had not done so, Los Angeles would have been completely obliterated,"" the president asserted on Monday in a Truth Social post.

Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple's App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.

Apple's iPad has a strong reputation for security. Thanks to the system architecture of iOS, a non-jailbroken iPad isn't susceptible to typical viruses or malware infections. However, that doesn't mean it's completely safe from every threat. As with any computer, there are still vulnerabilities that determined hackers can exploit.

iPads are generally secure devices, but it's still possible for hackers to gain access, so knowing the warning signs of a hacked iPad can help you act quickly to protect your data. Moreover, an iPad often contains a lot of personal information about you and your family, so if it's ever hacked, it can be quite alarming.

An Apple iPad (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

Be on the lookout for these signs that could indicate your iPad's security has been compromised:

If your iPad suddenly feels more like a sluggish turtle than the speedy device it used to be, that's a warning sign. When a device is hacked, malicious software might be running in the background, using up memory and processing power. This can make apps slow to open, cause lagging or freezing and even lead to more frequent crashes. You might also notice the battery draining much faster than usual along with the slowdown, since unwanted software can chew through battery life while it secretly runs in the background.

A sudden flood of pop-up ads or strange messages on your iPad screen is a big red flag. Under normal circumstances, iPads should not bombard you with random pop-ups, especially outside of safe apps or websites. If you start seeing lots of unsolicited ads or ""Your iPad is hacked!"" alerts popping up, it could mean an adware program or scam has found its way onto the device. These pop-ups might try to trick you or your kids into clicking links or downloading something harmful, so they're not just annoying, they're dangerous signs that something is wrong.

An Apple iPad (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

HOW TO PROTECT AN IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE 2025

Keep an eye on how the iPad is using the internet. An unusual spike in data usage or constant network activity (even when no one is actively using the iPad) might indicate the device is secretly sending or receiving information without your permission. For example, if your data plan suddenly maxes out or you notice the Wi-Fi icon flickering with activity when the iPad is idle, it could be a sign that a hacker's software is communicating in the background. Such suspicious network activity is concerning because it suggests someone else might be remotely accessing the iPad or siphoning off personal data.

HOW TO TRANSFER INFO FROM AN OLD IPAD TO A NEW IPAD

One clear warning sign is finding changes to your Apple account that you didn't make. If your Apple ID password was changed without your knowledge or you receive security alerts about logins you never did, be wary; a hacker may have gained access to your account.

You might also discover that account details or settings (like your recovery email or trusted phone number) have been altered. Another clue is seeing unfamiliar charges or App Store purchases on your Apple ID bill, since unauthorized purchases or subscriptions often mean that someone has compromised your account and is using it maliciously.

An Apple iPad (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

BEST VPNS FOR IPHONES & IPADS – CYBERGUY PICKS 2025

If you suspect your iPad has been hacked, taking immediate action can secure your device and give you peace of mind. Here are a few basic steps to help you respond:

1) Reset your passwords: Change your Apple ID password right away (and any other important account passwords used on the iPad) to lock out any intruders. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don't have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.

2) Remove unfamiliar apps: Check the iPad for any apps you or your child didn't install. If you find an unknown app or a suspicious profile, delete it immediately. This helps eliminate any malicious programs the hacker may have added. To do this, open Settings, tap General > iPad Storage, scroll to find the unfamiliar app, tap it, then tap Delete App and confirm.

3) Update iOS: Make sure the iPad is running the latest version of iPadOS. Apple frequently releases security updates to fix vulnerabilities, so updating the software can shut down any loopholes the hacker might have used. Turning on automatic updates is a good idea to stay protected going forward.

4) Enable two-factor authentication: If you haven't already, turn on two-factor authentication for your Apple ID account. This feature adds an extra verification step (like a code sent to your phone) whenever someone tries to sign in, which can stop hackers in their tracks even if they somehow know your password. It's an excellent safeguard to prevent unauthorized access.

5) Have strong antivirus protection on all devices: Malware, spyware and viruses can run quietly in the background or compromise enough data before it is discovered. While not being hacked in the first place is the best position to be in, it is worse to give access to your iPad's data to a hacker for a prolonged period of time. That's why having strong antivirus software running consistently in the background of your device is a great way to prevent compromises from happening in the first place. Best antivirus security software and apps to protect you.

CAN IPHONE TEXTS HAVE MALWARE? SPOT & AVOID SMS SCAMS

It's important to remember that many of these symptoms can have innocent explanations, so don't panic at the first sign of trouble. For example, a new iOS update or a heavy app can temporarily slow down your iPad's performance, so one isolated issue doesn't always mean you've been hacked. However, if you notice multiple warning signs at the same time or anything that just doesn't feel right, it's best to act quickly and err on the side of caution.

Sheriff Chad Bianco of Riverside County said agitators ""are not protesting"" and condemned Gov. Newsom for not taking appropriate action.

The Department of Homeland Security is sharing information about more than a dozen illegal immigrant suspects accused of crimes in the United States who were arrested in Los Angeles starting on June 6.

The agency released the suspect information after violence broke out in Downtown LA over the weekend in response to the ICE raids that resulted in ""hundreds of illegal aliens [being] arrested by ICE officers and agents,"" including ""many with a criminal history and criminal convictions.""

DHS listed more information about 19 suspects that ICE Los Angeles arrested on June 7 who are accused of crimes ranging from robbery to second-degree murder to rape.

""America's brave ICE officers are removing the worst of the worst from LA's streets, while LA's leaders are working tirelessly against them,"" DHS said in a Sunday statement as riots continued through the weekend.

Sheriff Chad Bianco of Riverside County said agitators ""are not protesting"" and criticized Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom for not taking appropriate action.

""They are trying to violently influence something by political action. That is what this is. That is everything that the Constitution stands against,"" said Bianco, a Republican who is running for governor. ""That is what law enforcement stands against, and that is what will facilitate the downfall of our civilized society. A civilized society has an adherence to the rule of law, and there is consequence for breaking that social compact. And when politicians encourage this behavior.""

""He needs to stay out of the way of law enforcement. He knows nothing about this. He knows absolutely nothing about the enforcement of law.

""Dennis Buan, 18, of South Pasadena and David Hang, 15, of San Marino, California were killed, and seven others were wounded,"" the Department said in a Monday post on X. ""This criminal illegal alien is who Governor Newsom, Mayor Bass and the rioters in Los Angeles are trying to protect over U.S. citizens.""

""The men and women of ICE put their lives on the line to protect and defend the lives of American citizens,"" ICE Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. ""Make no mistake, Democrat politicians like Hakeem Jeffries, Mayor Wu of Boston, Tim Walz, and Mayor Bass of Los Angeles are contributing to the surge in assaults of our ICE officers through their repeated vilification and demonization of ICE. From comparisons to the modern-day Nazi gestapo to glorifying rioters, the violent rhetoric of these sanctuary politicians is beyond the pale. This violence against ICE must end.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Newsom and Bass for comment.

ICE said in a June 7 press release that it has arrested 2,000 illegal immigrants per day this week ""and these violent activists won't deter enforcement operations.""

These supporters in GOP districts told Fox News Digital they remain loyal to President Trump while voicing concerns about the long-term economic impact of the national debt.

Voters in red areas of the country are ringing alarm bells over the country's national debt just as President Donald Trump wants Congress to pass a bill experts say will add trillions to it over the next few years.

Fox News Digital spoke to voters in Trump voting districts throughout the United States to gauge how they feel about the U.S. national debt. Most of them said that it was a significant cause for concern, and some even called out the president they support for adding to it. 

""We need to address the national debt, and I thought that Trump was doing that when he brought in [Elon] Musk. Don't get me wrong, I'm a Trump supporter. But I think his spending's gotten a little bit out of control,"" Art, in Lapeer, Michigan, told Fox.

The national debt currently sits at $36.2 trillion and counting, according to Fox Business' National Debt Tracker. A new spending bill – dubbed the ""big, beautiful bill"" by Trump – has reinvigorated concern over how much higher the debt, with its implications for economic growth and future spending, can get.

The sweeping tax cuts and spending package, passed by the GOP-controlled House in May, addresses many of the president's legislative priorities on cutting taxes, boosting border security, American energy, defense, and rolling back some of former President Joe Biden's environmental regulations and tax credits.

However, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected the legislation would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt, prompting criticism from even Trump allies like Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla.

Former Department of Government Efficiency head Elon Musk even publicly feuded with the president over the bill last week, in a spat that played out on social media.

Ahead of the upcoming Senate vote on passing the bill, Fox News Digital asked voters in Republican voting precincts about the national debt, and many responded they had serious reservations.

A woman in Staten Island, New York, who asked to remain anonymous, told Fox, ""It's too big. And we're leaving it for the future, for our children, and we're leaving all that debt on them to pay for. I don't think that's right.""

""We can't keep spending ourselves into the ground and leaving that burden for our children and grandchildren,"" Franceen in Boca Raton, Florida, declared. 

Chris from Cypress, Texas said, ""I mean, I'm inheriting it, my kids are inheriting it, and we've got to cut it off, or we're going to default.""

Front Royal, Virginia, resident Frank told Fox that the debt has been a ""longstanding problem."" 

""It's probably going to be there even after I'm gone, but yeah, of course, any country has a problem with their debt. Of course, it's a problem,"" he said.

Joe in Lapeer said, ""Yes, I think it is an issue. So, at this time, I think it's going to level out over time. It can't keep going the way it was going, put it that way. You know, that's my opinion.""

A man from Staten Island, who asked to remain anonymous, acknowledged the problem but expressed hope that Trump will try to right the ship. 

""I think it's always a problem,"" he said. ""I think the other party was just – made everything upside down and now Trump's trying to fix it. So, it's going to take a few years, but I think we're on the right track.""

""It is a huge problem,"" Chad in Cypress, Texas, declared. ""You know, we've got to the point right now – I think we're $34, $36 trillion in debt. And it's like running up a credit card, you know, sooner or later the bill has to be paid and there's no reason for America to be in debt.""

However, another gentleman from Staten Island, who also asked to remain anonymous, told Fox he wasn't too concerned.

""I have no idea what the debt is. I could care less what the national debt is, as long as Trump makes this country a little better. National debt has been in existence for hundreds of years, right?"" he said.

The first major poll surveying opinions on the anti-ICE Los Angeles protests and riots found them to be significantly unpopular.

A YouGov poll of 4,231 U.S. adults conducted on Monday found that just 36% of respondents had a favorable view of the protests, compared to 45% who disapproved and 19% who weren't sure. The numbers were predictably polarized among political parties, with 58% of Democrats approving compared to 15% of Republicans and 35% of independents.

However, results were less polarized along ethnic lines despite the predominantly Latino composition of the protesters. A similar number of white and Hispanic people disapproved of the riots, 48% and 44%, respectively, though only 35% of black people disapproved. No racial group had more than 40% approving of the protests.

The popular perception of the protests regarding violence was split, with 38% believing they were mostly peaceful, 36% believing they were mostly violent, and 26% unsure. White and Hispanic respondents had identical views, with 36% believing they were mostly peaceful and 38% believing they were mostly violent. Black respondents were an outlier, with 44% believing them mostly peaceful compared to 22% believing them mostly violent.

As for the response to the protests and riots, 56% believed state and local authorities should lead the response, compared to 25% who believed federal authorities should.

Violent riots broke out in Los Angeles on Friday after a wave of Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in the city, with a weekend of protests that saw 50 arrests, including for attempted murder with a Molotov cocktail, and five officers and horses with the Los Angeles Police Department injured. President Donald Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard members and then ordered 700 Marines in on Monday.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The United States today confronts the greatest foreign espionage threat this country has ever faced. 

Many countries pose espionage problems for America. Still, China's spy threat far outpaces all others, encompassing human and technical spying. It's more dangerous even than the massive Soviet espionage effort against us during the Cold War.

Last year, former FBI Director Christopher Wray termed Beijing's espionage offensive against us the biggest the FBI has ever contended with. It was, he said, “broad and unrelenting,” aimed at “nearly every industry in the U.S. economy,” and almost overwhelming in scale.

House Republicans sounded a similar alarm, warning the public about the Chinese Communist Party's massive espionage-influence campaign against nearly every aspect of American life. They described Beijing as “an untrustworthy, adversarial actor by continually undermining American interests at every turn.” Democrats have been mostly absent in this crucial fight, between former President Joe Biden's compromising ties to the CCP as well as dalliances between leading Democrats and Chinese spies. 

President Donald Trump's second-term effort to boot out Chinese students from American college campuses is a step in the right direction. But much more is required. The FBI is America's lead counterespionage agency, and it's time to face the difficult truth that it's simply not up to the task of winning our Spy War against China.

There are many reasons for the FBI's shortcomings in counterintelligence. For most of its history, the bureau valued its law enforcement mission over national security endeavors. After 9/11, the FBI devoted enormous effort to national security, but that went much more to fighting terrorism than foreign espionage. Simply put, throughout the FBI's long history, catching spies has usually taken a back seat to catching bank robbers, white collar crooks, and terrorists. 

Neither does the bureau's new leadership seem up to the task before them. Director Kash Patel lacks significant national security experience, while his tenure as boss has featured lots of personal travel and aggressive hunts for leakers rather than customary FBI leadership activities. Neither has Patel indicated taking the FBI's major corruption problem seriously. He and his deputy, the Make America Great Again podcaster Dan Bongino, haven't said much about foreign spy threats, but reports that the FBI is taking agents off counterintelligence squads to pursue illegal immigrants indicate where the priorities of the “front office” are at present.  

Nevertheless, the FBI's true weakness in counterintelligence isn't about people or even priorities. It's the organization itself. The bureau has too many missions on its plate, serving as the top federal law enforcement agency while also being the lead counterintelligence agency. Given the vast extent of the spy threats we now face, that's asking the FBI to do too much. The bureau is doing a second-rate job at several key missions, all demanding top-rank performance. 

Americans don't realize it, but the FBI's position as our lead national law enforcement agency and domestic intelligence agency is highly anomalous. Most Western democracies and nearly all our close allies wisely separate the cops from the spies — by design. Take the United Kingdom's example, where domestic intelligence is handled by the Security Service, popularly called MI5, which lacks police powers, while law enforcement remains firmly in police hands. Our Anglosphere Five Eyes spy partners mirror Britain in their counterintelligence setup.

Moreover, putting so much power in the hands of the FBI poses enduring risks to civil liberties. Americans are rightly worried about the bureau's extraordinary power. In most democracies, the people who spy on you, while looking for foreign spies and terrorists, can't also arrest you, as the FBI can. 

Most of the first Trump administration's problems with the FBI, including the partisan weaponization of intelligence by the so-called “Deep State” against Republicans, happened because the bureau possesses an excessive degree of bureaucratic power in Washington, D.C. Operation Crossfire Hurricane, the FBI's Democrat-directed effort to pin Russian influence on Trump and his entourage, would have been impossible if the bureau had the restrictions on its mandate and authorities which are normal in most Western democracies. 

Neither is the FBI meddling in our politics anything new. Throughout his nearly half-century tenure as the FBI's director until 1972, J. Edgar Hoover was notorious for intervening in politics, up to and including the White House, based upon his being the boss of America's secret police force. He “held the files” on our elites. After Hoover finally left the scene, things didn't get much better, and unseemly FBI intervention in Washington, D.C., politics has happened more than it should. 

For instance, the notorious Watergate scandal, which brought down President Richard Nixon thanks to liberal outrage over a politically-motivated office break-in during our 1972 election campaign, was an FBI smear job. Liberal journalists won fame and fortune by reporting the backstory to the Watergate brouhaha, based on a well-connected confidential source codenamed “Deep Throat” who possessed deep knowledge of what happened and why. 

Deep Throat was none other than Mark Felt, a top FBI official and career bureau man. He hated Nixon because he didn't nominate Felt to replace Director Hoover. Felt, a conservative Republican, leaked the Watergate saga, which was, in truth, Felt's personal take on the scandal — hardly the unvarnished truth — to the media as a personal vendetta against the president, which had nothing to do with conventional politics.  

Republicans should have no illusions. The FBI is tempted toward improper and even illegal interventions in domestic politics because it simply possesses too much power. This meddling will continue until the bureau has the national security mission taken away from it, thereby aligning the U.S. with other developed democracies in how we handle the sensitive matter of counterintelligence. 

At present, the FBI owns the counterspy mission, with very little authority vested in the director of national intelligence, who only controls the small and bureaucratically ineffectual National Counterintelligence and Security Center, which amounts to chiefs lacking Indians. DNI Tulsi Gabbard cannot hope to seriously reform the Deep State without gaining the intelligence community's legal control over counterintelligence by taking that enormously important mission away from the FBI. 

That means creating a stand-alone domestic intelligence agency, charged with conducting counterintelligence and counterterrorism inside the U.S., but lacking police powers. If someone is found to be breaking the law by acting as a spy for a foreign power, the FBI will be called in to effect an arrest. This new agency will report to the DNI and provide strategic assistance and guidance in counterintelligence, assisting the CIA, the National Security Agency, and other IC stakeholders who work together against foreign espionage.  

Protests that such a bureaucratic change is “too hard” are excuses for inaction. Canada did exactly what was required in 1984, when it separated Ottawa's domestic intelligence mission away from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada's FBI equivalent, and handed it over to the newly created Canadian Security Intelligence Service, which is spies, not cops.

NCIS LAUNCHES INTERNAL REVIEW FOLLOWING NAVY SECRETARY SECURITY FAILURE

The only things preventing similar overdue reforms regarding American counterintelligence are inertia and obstruction. Naturally, the FBI won't want to lose the national security mission, but, in truth, the bureau is better at its criminal mission anyway. It's what the FBI is best at and prefers doing. Let it focus on its cops-and-robbers niche while letting others pursue the domestic intelligence mission with more professionalism and less partisanship. 

Republicans have no excuse not to reform American counterintelligence in this fashion. The clock's ticking. Congress seriously pondered taking the national security mission away from the FBI after the 9/11 attacks — it's hardly a novel concept. If such reforms aren't pursued, it's only a matter of time before the FBI gets dragged into politics yet again, weaponized against Republicans. The next Crossfire Hurricane will be a matter of when, not if.

The FBI has identified a man who was seen throwing cinder blocks at Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles during the riots in Los Angeles over the weekend. 

Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the news about identifying the suspect during an interview on Monday night with Fox News host Sean Hannity. 

“We have breaking news right now,” Bondi said on Fox News's Hannity. “The case where the guy was breaking up the cinder blocks, and he was throwing them at police cars.”

“The FBI has identified him,” Bondi added. “Bill Essayli, our incredible U.S. attorney out there, working with ATF, DEA, and the FBI, have been doing a remarkable job. That guy has just been identified, and they are doing a search warrant on his house as we speak.”

“His name is Reyes,” Bondi continued. “He is going to be on the ‘Most Wanted' list.”

Video of the suspect throwing cinder blocks at ICE SUVs urgently driving down a Southern California road went viral on social media over the weekend. He stood on an island in the middle of the street, wearing a motorcycle helmet, and threw rocks at the vehicles. Many of the rocks shattered windshields upon contact. Others cheered on as he kept hitting the cars and causing damage.

On Saturday, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino posted on X that the FBI was investigating the incident and searching for the, at the time, unidentified suspect. 

“I strongly suggest you turn yourself in, it's only a matter of time,” Bongino warned in the post.

Bondi echoed Bongino's sentiments and warnings after identifying Reyes on Hannity's show.

“So you can run, you can't hide,” Bondi asserted. “We are coming, federally. If you assault a police officer, if you rob a store, if you loot, if you spit on a police officer, we're coming after you.”

Thousands of rioters caused chaos and destruction over the weekend, protesting the illegal immigration enforcement operations that ICE carried out. Rioters vandalized buildings, set police cars and Waymo vehicles on fire, and assaulted law enforcement officials during the demonstrations. To address the violent acts and threats, President Donald Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to the area.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Activist Greta Thunberg was deported from Israel after a brief detention following her attempt to break Israel's naval blockade of the Gaza Strip.

Twelve activists were detained after Israeli naval forces boarded the Madleen early Sunday morning. Thunberg is among three of those who will be deported, and nine others have refused deportation, according to the Gaza Freedom Flotilla. The group said some were encouraged to accept deportation to speak about their experiences, while the others will have their cases heard at an Israeli court. Their first hearing is expected on Tuesday.

A spokeswoman for the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, Ann Wright, told the New York Times that Thunberg was on a flight to Paris as of Tuesday, after which she will fly to Stockholm, Sweden.

Wright said the coalition “generally encourages high-profile volunteers to leave as soon as possible to be able to speak directly to the media about their experiences to counter what the Israeli government may be saying.”

Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, will be representing the nine remaining activists. In a statement, the organization argued that the activists' detention was illegal under international law.

“The flotilla never entered Israeli territorial waters, nor was it intended to do so. The Madleen was sailing in international waters, where Israel has no legal jurisdiction or authority, and was headed toward the territorial waters of the State of Palestine, as recognized under international law,” the statement read.

“Israel has no legal authority to detain international volunteers aboard the Madleen,” Huwaida Arraf, human rights attorney and Freedom Flotilla organizer, said in a statement. “This seizure blatantly violates international law and defies the ICJ's binding orders requiring unimpeded humanitarian access to Gaza. These volunteers are not subject to Israeli jurisdiction and cannot be criminalized for delivering aid or challenging an illegal blockade — their detention is arbitrary, unlawful, and must end immediately.”

The group added that it would be sending more ships to try to break Israel's blockade until “Palestine is free.”

The Washington Examiner reached out to the Gaza Freedom Flotilla for further comment.

Israel insists that its naval blockade is essential to prevent arms smuggling to Hamas, which rules Gaza.

Sabine Haddad, a spokeswoman for Israel's Interior Ministry, said those who accepted deportation had waived their right to appear before a judge, while those who didn't will face one and then be deported after 96 hours in detention.

Sergio Toribio, a Spanish activist among the three who accepted deportation, characterized Israel's raid on the Madleen as an act of piracy.

“It is unforgivable. It is a violation of our rights. It is a pirate attack in international waters,” he told reporters.

The small Madleen carried some humanitarian aid, but its primary purpose was to break the Israeli naval blockade symbolically. In a Sunday Telegram post, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced that he had instructed Israeli forces to “take any means necessary” to stop the Madleen from reaching Gaza.

“To the antisemitic Greta and her fellow Hamas propaganda spokespeople, I say clearly: You should turn back — because you will not reach Gaza,” he said. “Israel will act against any attempt to break the blockade or aid terrorist organizations — at sea, in the air, and on land.”

After the vessel was boarded and the crew was arrested, the Freedom Flotilla said the activists had been “kidnapped by Israeli forces.”

The Israeli Foreign Ministry derided the voyage in a statement on X, characterizing it as a publicity stunt.

“The ‘Selfie Yacht' docked at Ashdod Port a short while ago. The passengers are currently undergoing medical examinations to ensure they are in good health,” it said, along with pictures of Thunberg and another member of the crew.

TRUMP SUGGESTS ANGER MANAGEMENT FOR ‘YOUNG, ANGRY' GRETA THUNBERG AFTER ISRAEL SEIZES GAZA AID SHIP

Thunberg, known for her climate activism, has taken up the cause of pro-Palestinian activism following the onset of the war in Gaza. Her recent detainment by Israel is one of her several arrests for staging protests against the war since Oct. 7. Her latest stunt earned the attention of President Donald Trump.

“Well, she's a strange person. She's a young, angry person,” Trump said when asked if he had a message for the activist. “I don't know if it's real anger; it's hard to believe, actually, but I saw what happened. She's certainly different. Anger management. I think she has to go to an anger management class. That's my primary recommendation for her.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

During a Monday segment on CNN News Central, data analyst Harry Enten explained that Trump's net approval on immigration has experienced a dramatic shift since his first term — it has moved from negative 21% in 2017 to plus-1% today, according to aggregate polling.

“This is Trump's net approval rating on immigration,” Enten told host John Berman. “It's gone up like a rocket now versus eight years ago during Trump's first term.”

Enten said the public's support for Trump's immigration strategy, especially among voters in areas directly affected by border policy and federal enforcement operations, is giving the president confidence to act decisively, even if it triggers clashes with Democratic state leaders.

“Trump is begging for a fight on this because he knows what he's doing so far is working with the American electorate,” Enten said. “It's not just on the broad issue of immigration where Trump is doing well — it's on the specifics.”

A new CBS News poll backs up Enten's analysis. According to the survey, 54% of the public supports Trump's recent mass deportation orders, and 51% support Immigration and Customs Enforcement's operations within local communities. These numbers mark a significant uptick from similar polling during Trump's first presidency.

Enten cited an Ipsos poll that found Republicans enjoy a 19-point advantage over Democrats on the issue of immigration.

“Americans believe that Democrats just don't have a clue on immigration,” Enten said, noting the GOP's credibility on the issue has grown substantially since 2024.

Trump deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles over the weekend after ICE agents arrested numerous illegal immigrants, many of them with serious criminal records, including assault with a deadly weapon, grand theft, and attempted rape.

The arrests triggered large-scale protests and violent clashes in parts of the city, with rioters setting vehicles on fire, launching fireworks and Molotov cocktails, and vandalizing buildings with anti-ICE slogans, including “KILL ICE.”

In response, Trump authorized the deployment of 2,000 National Guard members — a move Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) condemned as “manufacturing a crisis.” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass also blasted the action as an abuse of federal power.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

California Gov. Gavin Newsom doesn't like President Donald Trump activating the National Guard in his state. His solution should be to do a better job of making sure Democratic Party officials do not impede federal deportation operations. 

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents served warrants at several worksites across Los Angeles last Friday after a judge found probable cause that employers were using fictitious documents for illegal workers. Instead of working with federal law enforcement agencies conducting lawful arrests, Mayor Karen Bass issued a statement accusing the agents of sowing “terror.” She additionally promised to work with “immigrant rights community organizations” to coordinate a response, warning, “We will not stand for this.” Later, David Huerta, who is president of the Service Employees International Union of California, was arrested at a worksite for obstructing federal officers.

Throughout the rest of the day, rioters threw rocks at federal law enforcement vehicles and blocked their movement throughout the city. A mob of more than a thousand rioters surrounded and attacked a federal detention center where the illegal immigrants arrested were being detained. ICE agents called the Los Angeles Police Department for help, but it took over two hours for them to arrive. Rioting then continued throughout the night. One of the reasons for this was the fact that the city of Los Angeles has been chronically short of police officers for the past decade, which should be remembered when the Left complains about their reinforcement by the National Guard, which happened as violence continued.

On Saturday, California State Assemblyman Jose Luis Solache saw several Customs and Border Protection vehicles leave the freeway and enter his neighborhood. He followed them to a parking lot across the street from a Home Depot. The agents stayed in their cars and did not arrest anyone. But Solache nevertheless posted a video to his social media account urging followers to come and interfere. “No en mi distrito,” Solache said. “Not in my district. Vamonos pa fuera (let's go, get out of here).”

The incitement worked, and CBP agents found themselves surrounded by hundreds of rioters who threw rocks at them. Finally, sheriff deputies arrived and fired tear gas and flash-bang rounds to clear a path for CBP agents to escape the mob. But rioting continued throughout the day and into the night. Stores were looted — a sure sign that the rioters are not on the side of the angels — cars were set on fire, and fireworks were launched at police and their vehicles. 

Newsom wants to blame Trump for the violence, but his allegations do not bear scrutiny. “We didn't have a problem until Trump got involved,” Newsom falsely tweeted Sunday night. But Trump did not announce activation of the National Guard until midnight on Saturday, at which time Los Angeles had been engulfed in rioting for two days. The failure to maintain law and order was entirely Newsom's, along with the Democratic Party and Mayor Bass. They are the ones telling constituents not to tolerate federal law enforcement in their communities. They are the ones instigating mobs into violence.

Democrats and their open border allies are allowed to protest Trump's policies peacefully. If Democratic politicians want to stand with illegal immigrants and wave the Mexican flag, they are at liberty to do so, dumb though it would be politically. But they have no right to obstruct federal law enforcement as officers serve warrants and lawfully arrest illegal immigrants for deportation.

THE SUPREME COURT MUST REIN IN BIDEN'S OPEN BORDERS JUDGES

The anti-law enforcement rhetoric of the Democratic Party has created a dangerous environment in California. These are the same Democrats who refuse to enforce the state laws against illegal camping, drug dealing, burglary, shoplifting, and arson. Trump has every right to call in the National Guard to make sure federal agents are safe, especially if the LAPD takes two hours before responding to calls for help.

Only 300 National Guard soldiers have been deployed to protect three federal locations in Los Angeles. If Newsom and Bass want to prevent more troops from coming, they should stop obstructing ICE's work.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Locked in its embrace of tax-cutting orthodoxy, the GOP has no credible way to address the country's looming fiscal crisis.

Congressional Republicans love to talk about the deficit and federal spending, particularly when Democrats are in power. Before he became House speaker, Mike Johnson argued in his 2018 statement titled “7 Core Principles of Conservatism” that America was facing “an unprecedented debt and spending crisis.” In Johnson's view, Congress had “a moral and constitutional duty” to bring expenditure under control. In 2023, before he became the Senate majority leader, John Thune inveighed against “reckless, out-of-control government spending” and argued that if spending reform is a priority for the GOP alone, then there is “something seriously wrong with the Democrat Party.”

They had a point. Aside from the brief period from 1998 to 2001, the federal government has run deficits for more than 50 years. When Ronald Reagan entered office, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio—a standard metric economists use to measure government indebtedness—stood at just 32.5 percent. It currently stands at 121 percent, an extraordinary level for peacetime. In President Joe Biden's last year in office, the government brought in revenues of $4.9 trillion against outlays of $6.75 trillion, resulting in a deficit of $1.8 trillion, or about 6.4 percent of GDP. And President Donald Trump's One Big, Beautiful Bill Act will only compound the problem: The Congressional Budget Office estimates that its proposed extension of his 2017 tax cuts for another 10 years will add more than $2.4 trillion to the national debt.

The United States is now experiencing a structural deficit with potentially dire fiscal consequences. Serious efforts to curb spending—which DOGE is not—are desperately needed. Yet the task of closing the huge gap in our government finances has another dimension besides cost-cutting: Raising revenue, too, is desperately needed.

Jonathan Chait: Why DOGE could actually increase the deficit

The Republicans' focus on spending—when they're not responsible for it—obscures the fact that the U.S. collects significantly less money as a share of GDP than comparable countries, and less than it has taken in historically. Among OECD countries in 2023, the United States ranked 32nd out of 38 for the revenue it collects as a share of GDP. Among advanced industrial democracies, only Ireland and Chile collect less. And at 17 percent of GDP in 2024, federal revenues are well below their peak of nearly 20 percent in 2000, at the end of the Clinton administration. The following year, the United States enjoyed a $128 billion surplus, and the Congressional Budget Office projected that the national debt would be paid off by 2009.

Instead, tax cuts under George W. Bush in 2001 added $8 trillion to the deficit; a further round of cuts by Trump in 2017 contributed another $1.8 trillion. Spending went up as well, but the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that 37 percent of the current deficit can be attributed to these tax cuts.

For the Republican Party, tax cuts are now divorced from any specific fiscal context and have become a way of life. In a fusion of ideology and self-interest, a powerful nexus of monied interests, lobbying groups, members of Congress, conservative intellectuals, and media worked together to enforce anti-tax orthodoxy and stamp out dissent. Tax cuts were one of the few policy areas that the party's disparate factions—Wall Street Republicans, Main Street Republicans, Silicon Valley libertarians, and social conservatives—could all agree upon.

Yet this long-established anti-tax consensus now confronts several looming challenges. The first is the party's shifting composition. The Republican base has become more populist in temperament and more working class in character, and low-income voters are less sympathetic to tax cuts that mainly favor their high-income peers. Recent polling by the Pew Research Center reveals that a plurality of Republicans and Republican leaners actually prefer raising taxes on households with incomes greater than $400,000, by a margin of 43 to 27 percent. (Among all Americans, 58 percent favor raising taxes on those with high incomes, whereas only 19 percent favor lowering them and 21 percent would keep them level.) Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's claim during his confirmation hearing that high-income “job creators” need the incentive of tax cuts may have been welcome to the GOP's wealthy donors and “starve the beast” enthusiasts, but such views are now a minority in the party.

A second challenge is the distributional impact of the new bill's tax-cutting measures. Many commentators wonder why, during a time of record deficits and debt, a further round of upper-income tax cuts is necessary. Analysis from the Tax Policy Center notes that while average effective tax rates barely changed from 1945 to 2015 for most Americans, the rates for high-income households have fallen sharply. Tax Policy Center scholars have also noted that nearly half the benefits of an extension of the Trump cuts would go to the top 5 percent of households (those making $450,000 or more). Democrats have been quick to seize on the inequity of cutting Medicaid and SNAP benefits to finance this upper-income giveaway.

The third challenge is that, by taking revenue increases off of the table, Republicans have saddled themselves with an unsolvable fiscal conundrum. Cuts on the order of 27 percent across the entire federal budget would be needed to bring spending in line with revenue. If major categories of expenditure such as Social Security, Medicare, defense, and debt servicing are exempted, spending cuts alone cannot tackle the deficit. Acknowledging the magnitude of this gap, a few fiscal hawks in Congress, such as Senator Rand Paul and the House Freedom Caucus, have called for even deeper cuts. But many Republicans fear with justification that such a course would bring grave political risk.

What Republicans are not grappling with, but should, is the disconnect between their intellectual justifications and economic and fiscal reality. Their first rationale is that tax cuts ultimately pay for themselves in higher government revenues through increased economic growth. To be blunt, no persuasive evidence exists for this contention at either the federal or the state level, including in the record of the 2017 cuts now proposed for extension. Republicans' second rationale makes a more nuanced assertion that higher taxes will depress economic growth, reducing jobs and inhibiting the downward distribution of income. Yet rigorous comparative analyses across multiple countries have found no serious evidence to support this contention. The economist Paul Krugman has referred to such arguments as “zombie” ideas that keep “eating people's brains” long after their intellectual credibility is dead and buried.

Buffeted by these forces, cracks are starting to appear in the GOP's anti-tax orthodoxy. Some MAGA voices, such as Steve Bannon, have recently come out in favor of a tax hike on the wealthy to finance cuts for the middle class. Others, such as Vice President J. D. Vance and Project 2025 eminence Russell Vought, have expressed interest in raising taxes on those earning more than $1 million a year. They met fierce resistance from Republican luminaries such as Newt Gingrich, Larry Kudlow, Sean Hannity, Mike Johnson, and Ted Cruz. And the ultimate enforcer of tax-cutting orthodoxy, Grover Norquist, recently compared any Republicans willing to consider tax increases to a “little cancer cell in the party.”

Trump himself has tried to have it both ways, toying with the idea of raising taxes on the wealthy to cater to his populist base without actually doing anything to forestall his tax-cut extensions. His gesture toward putting America on a sounder financial footing is to argue that his tariffs can play an important role in replacing income-tax revenues. The Congressional Budget Office has calculated that, under certain configurations, tariffs could raise significant additional revenues over the next decade. But all credible projections suggest that tariffs will be unable to compensate for the lost income tax. They are also a highly regressive form of taxation that may spark retaliation by other countries, result in higher inflation, and reduce both economic growth and the tax revenues that flow from it.

Read: Republicans still can't say no to Trump

Republicans who are serious about the deficit have several options. The most obvious one would be to close the gap between the tax revenues owed to the government and what it actually collects. The  IRS estimates that in 2022, about 13 percent of taxes, totaling $606 billion, owed to the federal government under our existing tax code were not paid. Many analyses of federal tax policy and enforcement—including some by conservative scholars—have argued for beefing up the IRS, with a focus on high-net-worth individuals and households. Few investment opportunities yield a higher rate of return than IRS audits on upper-income filers, yet the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have moved in the other direction and sought to cut the agency's staff and funding.

Other steps Republicans could take would aim to end tax breaks for the über-rich. Sunsetting the 2017 bill's higher estate-tax deductions, which now stand at $14 million for individuals and $28 million for married couples, would bring in an estimated $201 billion over the next 10 years. The state and local tax (better known as SALT) deduction changes in the proposed bill are extremely regressive, with much of the benefit flowing to upper-income households; they are another loophole that could be closed. Republicans could also raise revenue specifically for transportation infrastructure by increasing road-user fees and gas or mileage taxes. (The gasoline tax has been frozen at 18.4 cents a gallon for more than 30 years.)

None of the above will be easy, or even possible, to achieve in this Congress. The Republican Party has come a long way from the days when Ronald Reagan raised taxes four times after his 1981 tax cuts led to higher projected deficits. The official posture of fiscal rectitude continues, but the GOP's $10 trillion secret—the amount that tax cuts have contributed to the national debt—is that, if forced to choose, many on the anti-tax right would prefer bigger deficits to higher taxes.

The United States no longer has that luxury. The government's interest payments have become larger than its defense expenditures, debt-rating agencies are downgrading the U.S., bond traders are demanding higher yields on U.S. treasuries, and risks to the dollar as the world's reserve currency are piling up. To redeploy Thune's phrase, something is “seriously wrong” with a party that worries about running deficits yet refuses to consider any sustainable way to pay for them—and instead slashes services to its rural and working-class constituents. Rigid principle must give way to pragmatism: Any genuine deficit-reduction conversation needs to include not just spending cuts but higher revenues.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Protecting the powerhouse of the cell is a central mission of MAHA.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s warning about mitochondria slipped in between the anti-vaccine junk science and the excoriation of pharmaceutical drugs as “the No. 3 killer in our country.” He was speaking in 2023 to Joe Rogan, elaborating on the dangers of Wi-Fi—which no high-quality scientific evidence has shown to harm anyone's health—and arguing that it causes disease by somehow opening the blood-brain barrier, and by degrading victims' mitochondria.

The mention of mitochondria—the tiny structures that generate energy within our cells—was brief. Two years later, mitochondrial health is poised to become a pillar of the MAHA movement, already showing up in marketing for supplements and on podcasts across the “manosphere.” Casey Means, President Donald Trump's newest nominee for surgeon general, has singled out the organelle as the main casualty of the modern American health crisis. According to Means (who has an M.D. but no active medical license), most of America's chronic ailments can be traced to mitochondrial dysfunction. Should she be confirmed to the post of surgeon general, the American public can expect to hear a lot more about mitochondria.

Among scientists, interest and investment in mitochondria have risen notably in the past five years, Kay Macleod, a University of Chicago researcher who studies mitochondria's role in cancer, told me. Mitochondria, after all, perform a variety of crucial functions in the human body. Beyond powering cells, they can affect gene expression, help certain enzymes function, and modulate cell death, Macleod said.

When mitochondria are defective, people do indeed suffer. Vamsi Mootha, a mitochondrial biologist based at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute, told me that rare genetic defects (appearing in about one in 4,300 people) can cause the organelles to malfunction, leading to muscle weakness, heart abnormalities, cognitive disability, and liver and kidney problems. Evidence also suggests that defects in mitochondria directly contribute to symptoms of Parkinson's disease, and could be both a cause and an effect of type 2 diabetes. Other conditions' links to mitochondria are blurrier. Researchers see aberrant mitochondria in postmortem biopsies of patients with illnesses such as Alzheimer's, cancer, and fatty-liver disease, Mootha said; whether those damaged mitochondria cause or result from such conditions is not yet clear.

But according to Good Energy, the book Means published last year with a top MAHA adviser—her brother, Calley—mitochondrial dysfunction is a veritable plague upon the United States, responsible for both serious illness and everyday malaise. In their view, modern Western diets and lifestyles wreck countless Americans' metabolic health: Every time you drink unfiltered water or a soda, or feel the stress of mounting phone notifications, you hurt your mitochondria, they say, triggering an immune response that in turn triggers inflammation. (Damaged mitochondria really can cause inflammation, Macleod said.) This chain of events, the Meanses claim, can be blamed for virtually every common chronic health condition: migraines, depression, infertility, heart disease, obesity, cancer, and more. (Casey Means did not respond to requests for comment; reached by email, Calley did not respond to my questions about mitochondria, but noted, “There is significant scientific evidence that healthy food, exercise and sleep have a significant impact on reversing chronic disease.”)

Good Energy follows a typical wellness playbook: using a mixture of valid and dubious research to pin a slew of common health problems on one overlooked element of health—and advertising a cure. Among the culprits for our mitochondrial ravaging, according to the Meanses, are poor sleep, medications, ultraprocessed foods, seed oils, too many calories, and too few vitamins, as well as chronically staying in comfortable ambient temperatures. The Means siblings therefore recommend eschewing refined sugar in favor of leafy greens, avoiding nicotine and alcohol, frequenting saunas and cold plunges, getting seven to eight hours of uninterrupted sleep a night, and cleansing your life of environmental toxins. Some studies indeed suggest that mitochondrial function is linked with sleep and temperature, but they've all been conducted on cell cultures, organoids, or mice. According to Macleod, evidence suggests that diet, too, is likely important. But only one lifestyle intervention—exercise—has been definitively shown to improve mitochondrial health in humans.

The Meanses are riding a wave of interest in mitochondrial health in the wellness world. Earlier this year, the longevity influencer Bryan Johnson and the ivermectin enthusiast Mel Gibson both endorsed the dye methylene blue for its power to improve mitochondrial respiration; Kennedy was filmed slipping something that looks a lot like methylene blue into his drink. (Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment; the FDA has approved methylene blue, but only as a treatment for the blood disease methemoglobinemia.) AG1, formerly known as Athletic Greens, formulates its drinkable vitamins for mitochondrial health. Even one laser-light skin treatment promises to “recharge failing mitochondria.” The enzyme CoQ10 is popular right now as a supplement for mitochondrial function, as is NAD, a molecule involved in mitochondria's production of energy. NAD IV drips are especially beloved by celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Kendall Jenner, and the Biebers. These supplements are generally thought to be safe, and some preliminary research shows that NAD supplementation could help patients with Parkinson's or other neurodegenerative diseases, and that CoQ10 could benefit people with mitochondrial disorders. Patients whose symptoms are clearly caused or made worse by deficiencies in a specific vitamin, such as thiamine, can benefit from supplementing those vitamins, Mootha said. But little research explores how these supplements might affect healthy adults.

Read: The MAHA takeover is complete

In Good Energy, as well as on her website and in podcast appearances, Casey Means promotes a number of supplements for mitochondrial health. She also recommends that people wear continuous glucose monitors—available from her company, Levels Health, for $184 a month—to help prevent overwhelming their mitochondria with too much glucose. (According to Macleod, glucose levels are only “a very indirect measure” of mitochondrial activity.) As with so many problems that wellness influencers harp on, the supposed solution to this one involves buying products from those exact same people.

At best, all of this attention to mitochondria could lead Americans to healthier habits. Much of the advice in Good Energy echoes health recommendations we've all heard for decades; getting regular exercise and plenty of fiber is good guidance, regardless of anyone's reasons for doing so. Switching out unhealthy habits for healthy ones will likely even improve your mitochondrial health, Jaya Ganesh, a mitochondrial-disease expert at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told me. After all, “if you consistently beat your body up with unhealthy habits, everything is going to fall sick,” Ganesh said.

But the mitochondrial approach to wellness carries risks, too. For patients with genetically caused mitochondrial disease, lifestyle changes might marginally improve some symptoms, Ganesh said, but attempting to cure such conditions with supplements and a healthy diet alone could be dangerous. Means also calls out medications—including antibiotics, chemotherapy, antiretrovirals, statins, and high-blood-pressure drugs—for interfering with mitochondria. Macleod told me that statins really do affect mitochondria, as do some antibiotics. (The latter makes sense: Mitochondria are thought to have evolved from bacteria more than a billion years ago.) That's no reason, though, to avoid any of these medications if a doctor has determined that you need them.

Read: America can't break its wellness habit

And yet, a whole chapter of Good Energy is dedicated to the idea that readers should mistrust the motives of their doctors, who the authors say profit by keeping Americans sick. The book is less critical of the ways the wellness industry preys on people's fears. Zooming in on mitochondria might offer a reassuringly specific and seemingly scientific explanation of the many real ills of the U.S. population, but ultimately, Means and MAHA are only helping obscure the big picture.

The 1992 deployment in Los Angeles proved that troops operate best on the streets when the state is in charge.

Donald Trump just did what no other president has ever done in the context of urban unrest: He sent federal troops to a state without a request from the governor. By federalizing California National Guard members on Saturday, the president abrogated Governor Gavin Newsom's authority over his own Guard. During both previous instances of a presidential order to deploy National Guardsmen to American cities—the Los Angeles riots in 1992 and the Hurricane Katrina response in 2005—the state's governor was overseeing a public-safety apparatus that had been overwhelmed. Trump, seizing on unlawful behavior that included vandalism, violence, and refusing to disperse during protests against ICE raids in L.A., announced that 2,000 reservists would be deployed to the city, unilaterally and contra Newsom's advice.

Trump's decision—to exercise his Title 10 authority to federalize the National Guard under his command—was not based on a careful assessment of the operational needs on the streets of Los Angeles. Even if the White House's escalating rhetoric and threats of full military deployment were justified by circumstances that merited overruling a governor, the notion that the armed services will stop protests and quiet widespread outrage about Trump's immigration-enforcement policies in California is naive and flawed. Implicated in Trump's decision was a lot of prior controversy—immigration and deportation, ICE raids, tension between blue states and the White House, a personal beef with Newsom—but the president's assertion that a troop presence is the answer to public unrest is particularly dubious. Historically, these deployments have proved of limited value even when the president and governor agree on goals. Sending in the military as a hostile force is a recipe for trouble.

During the 1992 L.A. riots, after four white police officers were acquitted of assaulting Rodney King, 63 people were killed amid widespread arson and looting as rioting spread through the city. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina killed nearly 1,000 people in Louisiana and left New Orleans with no functioning government and little law enforcement. In each case, National Guard deployment was essentially a response to the incapacity of the local police force—either because the cops had become the focus of hostility or because they simply could not meet the demands of the crisis. And in both instances, the governor requested the federal intervention.

David Frum: For Trump, this is a dress rehearsal

One key lesson of the L.A. deployment was that a failure to define command-and-control responsibilities resulted in operational problems and delays. The National Guard under Governor Pete Wilson's authority was supposed to protect first responders (especially firefighters) and emergency work crews trying to fix critical infrastructure. Trained to help with crowd control, these troops also supported police patrols—to protect shopping centers from looting, for example. The soldiers' initial deployment was slow, and they were not fully prepared for the mission. But in the days that followed, the rioting subsided and the National Guard was able to perform much of its mission and provide relief to the overstretched police forces.

By then, however, Wilson had lost confidence in the National Guard's leadership and was unnerved by the scale of disorder. He asked the White House for help, and President George H. W. Bush sent in 3,500 federalized troops. Despite deploying in a less demanding situation, these federalized soldiers were unable to provide the effective support required on the ground. In the end, the state Guard proved the more flexible and adaptable force. The new military task force formed by the federal deployment never satisfactorily resolved issues with its mission, its communications, and its rules of engagement. The problems of this uneasy collaboration with local and state police agencies filtered down, hampering the street-level response.

The events of L.A. in 1992—and the explicit lessons that state, federal, and military authorities took from them—are why, until now, the task of dealing with civil unrest or natural disasters has remained largely with the National Guard acting under state jurisdiction. The National Guard has also been integrated into homeland-security efforts on the same basis. If one Guard force encounters a situation that exceeds its capacity, it can turn to another state's Guard under mutual-aid agreements.

Mutual aid does not seem to have been on Trump's mind last weekend. The National Guard exists to provide governors with additional power to protect their citizens, and to do so in support of local first responders. Trump's hasty federalization of troops is unwise and unhelpful, before we even consider what malign political motive may lie behind the order.

Right now, the Pentagon appears not even to have arranged sleeping arrangements for its troops, let alone determined the rules of engagement on the streets; the San Francisco Chronicle reports that the deployment was so “wildly underprepared” that troops are sleeping in cramped quarters on the floor. At best, this deployment will be completely unnecessary. At worst, it will be deeply counterproductive. But Trump's motive is transparent—and he will surely engineer an occasion to keep escalating his power plays, until they seem normal.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The failure to deploy rural broadband has become synonymous with excessive bureaucracy. The real story is more complicated.

The buzziest idea in Democratic politics right now is the “abundance agenda,” which criticizes liberals for saddling government programs with bureaucratic red tape that delays those programs to the point of never delivering. Few examples seem to illustrate the point better than rural broadband.

As part of the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, Congress allocated $42.5 billion in subsidies to a new Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program. Its required 14 procedural steps to actually get this funding to internet service providers, or ISPs—companies such as AT&T, Verizon, Charter, and Frontier—along with significant labor, environmental, and domestic-production requirements, seem to fit the pattern of a well-intentioned program that has been stuffed with too many bells and whistles. (One of us, Asad Ramzanali, worked on broadband issues including BEAD in both the House of Representatives and the White House.)

Thus, three and a half years after the law passed, shovels have still not broken ground on any project funded by this program, as the New York Times columnist Ezra Klein recently explained to an incredulous Jon Stewart, who lamented the “incredibly frustrating, overcomplicated Rube Goldberg machine that keeps people from getting broadband.”

Figuring out how to provide high-speed internet to all Americans has been an important public-policy goal for decades. As the coronavirus pandemic made painfully clear, broadband is crucial to full participation in society. And multiple empirical studies have shown that increased broadband access is correlated with stronger economic growth. Yet more than 7 million homes and businesses still do not have access.

But the current political debate misunderstands the nature of the problem at almost every level. When it comes to broadband, procedural simplicity on its own hasn't worked in the past and won't work in the future. The deeper issue is that the United States government has abandoned the full range of policy tools that would actually get the job done. Any effort to achieve “abundance” must start by recognizing that red tape isn't the only reason America can't seem to build anymore.

The BEAD program does seem overcomplicated. It requires the Federal Communications Commission to complete a national map of where broadband is currently missing, the Commerce Department to distribute funding to states, state-level broadband offices to allocate subgrants to internet service providers, and the ISPs to deploy cables to connect homes to the internet. The numerous intermediate steps—initial planning grants, five-year action plans, map challenges, final plans, and more—sound like the kind of red tape that blocks progress and generates distrust in government.

The solution seems glaringly obvious: simplify the steps. Cut out all the middlemen and empower the FCC to provide money directly to ISPs as efficiently and quickly as possible. Any reasonable person would reach that conclusion.

The first Trump administration had the same thought. In 2020, the FCC rolled out a multibillion-dollar program called the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF). To allocate the money, the FCC quickly identified areas that had insufficient service. It then held a reverse auction of small geographic plots, awarding the subsidy to whichever ISP submitted the lowest bid for each plot. There was no notice of funding opportunity. No planning grants. No five-year action plans. No subgranting process. No state broadband offices. And no labor, environmental, small-business, or diversity requirements. ISPs quickly bid a cumulative $9.2 billion to serve high-speed broadband to 5.2 million homes and businesses.

Jerusalem Demsas: Not everyone should have a say

In many ways, RDOF was a neoliberal economist's dream—an efficient allocation of scarce public resources distributed through a competitive process. But removing bureaucratic steps turned out not to result in a better outcome. Without accurate mapping data to understand where need existed, RDOF allowed ISPs to bid on serving such locations as an empty patch of grass, industrial-park storage tanks, and a luxury resort that already had broadband. Without proper due diligence, other providers committed to projects that were not technically or financially feasible.

As a result, the RDOF program still hasn't delivered much broadband to Americans. More than one-third of the bids have already been deemed in default, according to the FCC. In other words, nearly 2 million of the 5.2 million promised locations will never get service under the program, and that number is likely to keep growing. Worse, many of these locations may not get service from BEAD, either, because RDOF was assumed to cover them.

Within that context, Congress's approach to the BEAD program—making sure that broadband maps are accurate; that state governments, who know their residents and needs best, develop thorough plans that will ensure long-lasting service; and that communities have opportunities to provide input—is less baffling. With the benefit of hindsight, the process should have been simpler. But Congress was clearly responding to the failures of RDOF, which meant more checks in the system.

Why is internet service a problem that the government needs to solve, anyway? The answer is that private-sector companies seek to maximize profits, but in many rural areas, building networks is unprofitable. There might not be enough customers to offset the onetime costs of construction or even the ongoing costs of repairs, customer service, and overhead.

To date, the federal government's approach to promoting service in unprofitable areas has almost exclusively been to subsidize private companies. The first federal broadband subsidies go back to at least 1995. Since then, the U.S. has put more than $100 billion into broadband expansion, primarily into rural areas, across more than 100 federal programs. Like RDOF, many of these programs have severely underperformed.

This is what happens when government loses the ability, or the will, to undertake more direct interventions in the market and to challenge, not merely subsidize, corporations. A century ago, America faced a problem almost identical to the broadband shortage: rural electrification. Well into the 20th century, life in much of rural America was little changed from the 19th. Without electric appliances—refrigerators, washing machines, even lamps—running a farm was backbreaking, round-the-clock work. By 1935, private providers had electrified more than 80 percent of nonfarm households but only 11 percent of farm households. That year, as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, Congress created the Rural Electrification Administration to address this problem.

At first, REA Administrator Morris Cooke hoped to partner with private electricity companies, not unlike our current subsidy-heavy approach for broadband. However, those companies argued that rural electrification would not be financially self-sustaining. Even with government support, they proposed building out to only 351,000 new customers, which would leave millions unconnected.

The New Dealers recognized that subsidies to private firms could only go so far. So they turned to three other strategies. First, when the private sector was unable to serve all Americans, the REA organized communities across the country to develop their own, cooperatively owned electricity-distribution networks, funded by the federal government. The REA encouraged state laws to charter these cooperatives, provided engineering support to build infrastructure, and assisted cooperatives in negotiating for sources of electrical power.

Second, the New Deal created public options. Federal government–owned providers, most famously the Tennessee Valley Authority, were established to generate electricity at affordable rates. These public options functioned as an important “yardstick,” in Roosevelt's words, to evaluate the performance of the private sector. If the private sector refused to offer electricity at affordable rates, the TVA could step in to sell electricity directly to cooperatives instead.

Third, private-sector electricity providers were classified as public utilities subject to strict regulation. The government couldn't build public plants to generate power across the entire country or successfully organize every community. So it required electric companies to expand services to cover everyone in their existing and adjacent service areas, even households that were unprofitable to serve. These utilities were required to set prices that allowed them to turn reasonable but not excessive profits.

George Packer: How Virginia took on Dominion Energy

The REA was a success. By 1940, a quarter of farm households were electrified, and by 1953, that figure had risen to 90 percent. That same year, retail rural electricity rates approximated rates found in urban areas.

A similar approach could be applied to rural broadband today. Local governments could offer public broadband—as happened in Chattanooga, Tennessee, which has one of the fastest broadband networks in the world, run by the municipally owned electric company, a public option that competes with Xfinity and AT&T. Cooperatives could purchase internet service in the same way as they buy electricity. And public-utility regulations could require broadband providers to cover areas adjacent to their service areas at a reasonable price in exchange for rate regulation.

So why has the federal government focused on subsidizing for-profit ISPs rather than using the mixed approach that worked during the New Deal era?

Consider what happened in Chattanooga. After its municipal model proved successful, ISPs saw a threat and mobilized. They successfully lobbied lawmakers to pass laws restricting public options in broadband. Twenty-five states, including Tennessee, had such laws on the books in 2019, according to a report by BroadbandNow. In Congress, Democrats have repeatedly proposed federal legislation to preempt such state laws, but those proposals have languished. And although some of the state limits on public options have been repealed, 16 states still restrict municipal broadband. Lobbying from ISPs might likewise explain why the FCC has never used its existing legal authority to require ISPs to expand service at mandated affordable prices. (A conservative appeals court foreclosed that option for the FCC only recently.)

The lesson of rural broadband is that some government failures are due not to procedural excess, but to giving up on regulatory tools that might antagonize Big Business. Unfortunately, learning this lesson again may now cost us $42.5 billion. Last week, the Department of Commerce rolled back many procedural hoops of the BEAD program—ostensibly with the same goals as RDOF. It's tempting to think that America can learn how to build again without having to wage difficult battles against powerful corporate interests, simply by eliminating bureaucratic red tape. But if efficient building were really so easy, we'd already be doing it.

Birthright citizenship is distinctly American—but not in the way Trump thinks.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The United States, Donald Trump says, “is the only country in the world” that grants citizenship to babies born within its borders. He's wrong, of course. Tanzania, Pakistan, and France all grant some form of birthright citizenship.

But birthright citizenship is ultimately an American ideal. That is, all of the Americas. Nearly every country in the Western Hemisphere grants citizenship to children born in its territory irrespective of the nationality of their parents. It's part of the promise of the New World, that the Western Hemisphere would be, as the American revolutionary Thomas Paine said of the United States, an “asylum” for humanity. “Open,” echoed George Washington, “to receive not only the opulent & respectable” but the “oppressed & Persecuted of all nations.” The children of those oppressed and persecuted would be citizens by right.

The legal term for birthright citizenship is jus solis, or “by right of soil”—in contrast to jus sanguinis, which assigns citizenship to children based on the national identity of one or both of their parents, an identity that could be defined by bloodline, race, or religion. Mexicans were the first to write jus solis into a constitution, in 1814, during their war of independence against Spain. In bright, unambiguous language, the rebels stated that “all those born in La Mexica América are considered citizens.” By “all,” they meant all. Having declared the abolition of both chattel slavery and Indigenous tribute and servitude, Mexican revolutionaries intended to make everyone, regardless of skin color, a member of the nation, but Spanish troops retook Mexico before this constitution could go fully into effect.

The three-century-old Spanish empire was obsessed with blood—how it conveyed lineage and, in the Spanish view, confirmed virtue. Jus sanguinis had been the law of the land, and a good part of the empire's massive bureaucracy worked to keep track of ancestry, issuing certificates of purity certifying that no taint of Jewish, Muslim, Native American, or African blood flowed in the bearer's veins.

Mexico was just one front in a hemisphere-wide war against Spanish rule, which began in 1810 and didn't end until 1826, when revolutionaries overran royalism's last bastion, the Pacific port city of Callao, Peru. With all of Spanish America (save Cuba and Puerto Rico) now free, the region's republican leaders were eager to leave Spain's blood medievalism behind, to create a modern legal system for the Americas.

The foundation of that system was jus solis. In a revolutionary act of inclusion, the new nations of Spanish America adopted it universally, to apply to every free resident within a given national territory. In Spanish America, as in the United States, the politics of jus solis was tied to the politics of race and slavery. The historians Martha S. Jones and Kate Masur recently submitted an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court to counter the Trump administration's efforts to abolish or curtail birthright citizenship. They note that free people of color—decades before the Civil War and ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868—regularly invoked a common-law version of jus solis: They were citizens of the United States because they'd been born in the United States. In 1848, African American activists in Pennsylvania published a pamphlet demanding constitutional protection, insisting that their “certificates of Birth and Nativity” provide all the “evidence” needed to confirm their citizenship. The nation's courts and laws, however, ensured that, in the United States, the bestowal of citizenship at birth remained predominantly a right enjoyed by white people.

David W. Blight: Birthright citizenship is a sacred guarantee

Spanish Americans applied jus solis more generously. In many of the region's new republics, to be born a citizen meant to be born free, as independence leaders moved quickly to repeal a doctrine—partus sequitur ventrem, Latin for “the child follows the womb”—that defined children born to enslaved mothers as also enslaved. Widely applied during Spanish rule, the doctrine was still the law of the land in U.S. slave states when Chilean insurgents declared their independence in 1810 and passed, a year later, the world's first “free womb” law.

The idea of childbirth as an emancipatory act was Spanish America's unique contribution to the transatlantic antislavery movement. Argentina followed with a similar law in 1813, then Colombia in 1814, Venezuela and Peru in 1821, and Ecuador and Uruguay in 1825. Different nations ended slavery at different times, depending on local politics. Many countries—Chile and Mexico, for instance—did so soon after their break with Spain. Others, including Argentina, took longer. But with independence, the end of human bondage in Spanish America was clearly in sight. “No one is born a slave,” Mexican abolitionists said. They are born citizens.

Racism of course continued throughout the now-free Spanish America, as did a status and class hierarchy organized around racial identity. It was easier to defeat Spain's army than to dismantle the social structure its empire left behind. And jus solis had a dark side. Politicians used generous citizenship and naturalization laws to encourage European migration and campaign to “whiten” the nation.

Still, compared with the expansion of chattel slavery and hardening of racial apartheid then taking place in the United States, Spanish America was exceptional. Its founders were creating something entirely new in the world: a community of sovereign nation-states composed, at least legally, of equal, racially diverse citizens.

James Madison noticed. The former president knew that his country couldn't go on subjugating people of color forever, be they, as he put it, “the black race within our bosom” or the “red on our border.” Writing in 1826, Madison thought it worth studying how “the regions South of us,” especially Mexico and Peru, were incorporating emancipated slaves and Indigenous peoples into their newly constituted nations.

Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina thought otherwise. Spanish America's “fatal error” was “placing the colored race on an equality with the white.” “Ours is the Government of the white man,” he said in 1848, and it needed to remain so. Denying birthright citizenship to people of color was necessary to that vision.

The United States eventually caught up with Latin America. In 1865, the Union Army defeated the Confederacy with the help of about 180,000 Black soldiers. Their rights could no longer be denied. The first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified three years later, finally granted citizenship to free people of African descent: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

The middle clause of that sentence—“and subject to jurisdiction thereof”—is U.S. birthright citizenship's potential Achilles heel. It shouldn't be, because congressional debates from that time make clear what the drafters meant by that phrase. As the historian Eric Foner writes, Congress intended that clause to exclude not migrants but specifically Native Americans, who, the argument went, were ineligible for U.S. citizenship because of their subordination to tribal jurisdiction. (Congress would grant them citizenship in 1924.) Also excluded were foreign diplomats and soldiers, who were protected by their home country's jurisdictional immunity. (Most Spanish American nations likewise exempted foreign envoys from their jus solis clause, though none excluded Native Americans.)

Migrants began arriving in the United States in massive numbers toward the end of the Civil War—mostly from Europe but also from Spanish America, the Caribbean, and Asia. Most came undocumented, without visas, passports, or formal permission to enter the country. Mexicans crossed the border at will, to work and to live.

If the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment wanted to exclude the children of these people from the benefit of birthright citizenship, they would have said so. But as Congress moved toward ratifying the amendment, whenever a nativist legislator proposed excluding this or that pariah people—the Chinese, say, or the Romani—from birthright citizenship, their colleagues pushed back with the broadest interpretation possible of jus soli, generous enough to cover, said California Senator John Conness, even “the children born here of Mongolian parents.” There is no doubt that the amendment's authors understood that the offspring of foreign migrants in the United States were subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.

But starting in the 1990s, activists and politicians seeking to restrict U.S. immigration policy interpreted the clause to apply to undocumented migrants. The first to formally do so was Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, a Democrat, who in 1993 introduced the Immigration Stabilization Act, arguing that a baby born to an undocumented mother who was a citizen of another country was, by definition, subject to that country's jurisdiction, not the United States'. Reid's proposal ignored the legal status of fathers and focused exclusively on the nationality of birth mothers, a curious resurrection of partus sequitur ventrem: The child follows the womb and is condemned to return to the country the mother fled.

Reid's bill died in committee (and Reid later regretted his proposal, calling it the “biggest mistake” he'd ever made). But it foreshadowed bad things to come. The Trump administration today is similarly asking the Supreme Court to interpret the clause to mean that children born of foreign nationals are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States, and therefore not eligible for citizenship.

Most of Latin America holds fast to birthright citizenship today. “All people born in Mexican territory,” Mexico's constitution states, “regardless of their parent's nationality,” are Mexican, an identity that can “never be revoked.” Colombia is one of the few nations that restricts jus solis, requiring at least one parent to be a nationalized Colombian. But with Venezuelans pouring into Colombia, fleeing their country's worsening situation, Bogotá—fearing the creation of a large class of gente apátrida (“stateless people”)—has waived restrictions on jus solis. While the Trump administration seems to be set on making life miserable for Venezuelan refugees, Colombia has issued an estimated 27,000 birth certificates to babies born of Venezuelans in its territory. Chile likewise liberalized its jus solis requirements to support the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Haitian refugees, allowing many of their children to become Chilean citizens.

The one woeful exception to the rule is the Dominican Republic. For decades, courts interpreted the constitution's exemption of people “in transit” from jus solis as pertaining to diplomats. Then, in 2013, the country's Constitutional Court, stocked with right-wing nationalists and inflamed by rising anti-Haitian racism (the Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti), ruled that “in transit” applied, retroactively to 1929, to Haitian migrant sugar-field workers.

Overnight, 200,000 individuals born in the Dominican Republic to Haitian parents were stripped of their citizenship. At least 80,000 people were deported into Haiti; most of them had lived their whole lives in the Dominican Republic, and few spoke French or Creole. These deportees were born poor, in rural communities, in many cases at home, and have no official documentation whatsoever to mark their existence.

If the United States follows the Dominican Republic and limits or does away with birthright citizenship, the result will likely be the kind of chaos seen in the Dominican Republic on an even greater scale. Trump's executive order is aimed at exempting from citizenship not just the children of undocumented parents but also the newborns of those in the United States legally, on work or student visas or awaiting their asylum hearings. The enforcement of such a restriction would require the re-creation of something like the blood-obsessed Spanish colonial bureaucracy, with officials demanding to see not just an individual's birth certificate to prove citizenship but at least one of their parent's birth certificates. The United States already has an underclass of millions of stateless workers. If their children and grandchildren were to be denied citizenship, that class would grow exponentially.

Apart from the Dominican Republic, the nativist right in Latin America hasn't launched the kind of full-on assault on birthright citizenship we see in the United States. But the slurs niño ancla and bebê âncora—“anchor baby”—have entered the Spanish and Portuguese languages, mostly through social media, as far-right figures, including Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and José Antonio Kast in Chile, whip up anger against refugees. Kast's anti-migrant party, Partido Republicano, is rising in the polls ahead of next year's presidential election, promising to tighten immigration laws and generally menacing Haitian migrants. In Argentina, Javier Milei has called for an end to the country's historic liberal immigration policies, in order to, he said, “make Argentina great again.”

The first batch of jus solis constitutions in Spanish America were drafted following a bloody, two-decade-long independence war, with fighting sprawling across the continent, scattering millions far from home. The men who led those wars were idealistic, but they also had pragmatic motives for embracing birthright citizenship: It was a way of re-rooting people, of settling a hemisphere in tumult.

The granting of citizenship to all children born within its territory does not, as Trump insists, make the United States exceptional. It makes it American.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Trump has expanded presidential power to ban broad groups of immigrants.

President Donald Trump can't stop using — and abusing — his legal authority to block the entry of noncitizens into the country.

When he issued a travel ban on citizens of Muslim-majority countries early in his first term, he did so by invoking Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows him to block any foreigner if he deems that their entry would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States.”

When he issued a proclamation turning away noncitizens who could not demonstrate the ability to pay for their health care costs, he cited Section 212(f).

When he halted most legal immigration at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, first from China and then from other countries, there was Section 212(f) again. 

Finally, last week, he announced that he would block foreign students from receiving student visas to attend Harvard University and implement a travel ban on 12 countries, as well as restrictions on seven others. The travel ban took effect on Monday, just after midnight, and the legal framework for both orders was built on Section 212(f).

Some of Trump's attempts to invoke Section 212(f) have been challenged in court. Judges struck down several versions of Trump's first-term travel ban before the third iteration was ultimately upheld by the US Supreme Court (after it was expanded to include non-Muslim-majority countries). Former President Joe Biden rescinded the travel ban, as well as the Covid-19 and health care-related bans, when he took office, refusing to defend them in legal challenges. 

The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis.

Most recently, a federal judge in Massachusetts also blocked Trump's order on Harvard students, and as of Monday, the State Department had returned to processing international student visas.

However, in testing the limits of 212(f) through these policies, Trump has succeeded in getting the Supreme Court to affirm his broad powers to ban foreign nationals under immigration law, marking a key expansion of executive authority. 

While previous presidents invoked Section 212(f), none of them did so as frequently or as aggressively as Trump. The law has become a key tool to keep people out as Trump tries to implement his restrictive vision of US immigration policy.

Before Trump, both Democratic and Republican presidents used the 212(f) authority sparingly. It was typically employed in order to enforce United Nations sanctions or target individuals or groups associated with terrorism, human rights violations, drug trafficking, or specific international crises. 

Former President Barack Obama, for instance, used the authority to block Russian officials from entering the US following their country's 2014 invasion of Crimea. 

Former President George W. Bush used it to block Syrian officials after the 2005 assassination of the Lebanese prime minister at the hands of the Syrian-backed militant group Hezbollah, which the US designates as a terrorist organization. 

Former President Bill Clinton used it to impose restrictions on Nigerian military officials who impeded the country's transition to democracy by annulling the country's 1993 elections.

Trump's conceptualization of 212(f), however, is markedly different. He has used the authority to block broad swaths of noncitizens from a variety of countries, not just their government officials or people involved in criminal activity. He has not spared US visa or green card holders in some cases, including those affected by his first travel ban. 

That has created a new legal paradigm that has afforded the president sweeping powers to keep immigrants out. 

The Supreme Court's 2018 decision narrowly upholding Trump's first travel ban made that shift clear. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that Section 212(f) “exudes deference to the President in every clause.” For that reason, the court refused to question the superficial national security rationale Trump provided for the travel ban. 

That's despite substantial evidence that the actual motivation behind the ban was, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor put it in the dissent, “anti-Muslim animus” that violated the Constitution's religious liberty protections. That evidence included Trump's 2015 campaign statements calling for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” which lower-court judges pointed to in blocking earlier versions of the travel ban in 2017.

The question is whether the justices will again defer to Trump if the new travel ban and ban on international students at Harvard come before the Supreme Court.

According to Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired immigration law professor at Cornell Law School, “court challenges to this travel ban are likely, but they may fail.” However, Yale-Loehr said, “even if this expansion is legal, it is not good policy. We are not necessarily safer by banning immigrants from these countries.”

Notably, the new travel ban includes exemptions for green card holders, noncitizens from affected countries who are already in the US, and athletes from the affected countries competing in international competitions like the Olympics. He's also invoked the potential for visa overstays, in addition to the usual national security grounds, in the rationale for his latest ban.

All of that might help Trump's case if the policy is challenged in court. Unlike a blanket ban on immigrants from the affected countries, it is tailored to withstand legal scrutiny by targeting only would-be immigrants who are currently not in the US. Additionally, the ban's invocation of national security concerns puts it in territory where the president has generally been afforded considerable discretion by the courts. (A fact he has taken advantage of in issuing a flurry of national emergency declarations on all sorts of issues.)

Given the particulars of the new ban and the administration's previous history before the Court, some immigrant advocates have turned to Congress, rather than the courts, to intervene. They are asking for a legislative fix to stop Trump from implementing policies that will affect both US citizens who might be separated from their families and citizens of foreign countries hoping to enter the US, though such a measure would almost certainly have to wait on unified Democratic control of government.

“Congress must act by codifying guardrails that prevent the wholesale banning of nationals from entire regions of the world under the pretext of ‘national security,'” Guerline Jozef, executive director of the immigrant advocacy group Haitian Bridge Alliance, said in a statement.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:vox.com","You might accidentally be killing hummingbirds","https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/416127/hummingbird-biodiversity-fungal-infection-feeders","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 11:30:00 GMT","

Here's how to help them instead. 

Hummingbirds run on sugar.

The fuel powers their tiny, furious bodies and super-fast wings, which beat as many as 80 to 90 times per second. And luckily for them, they don't seem to get diabetes, even though they have extremely high blood glucose levels. 

In the wild, hummingbirds, the smallest birds in the world, get their sugar from nectar-filled flowers, such as honeysuckle, lilies, and bee balm. But following the sweeping destruction of native prairies, forests, and wetlands over the last century, these fluttering jewels have had a more difficult time finding their glucose fix. 

While humans are responsible for that loss, some wildlife lovers are also trying to help hummingbirds by installing feeders. Hummingbird feeders — containers, often red and plastic, filled with sugar water — provide a supplementary source of nectar for hummingbirds, especially during fall and spring migration when the birds are traveling long distances. Research shows that feeders may increase the number of hummingbirds locally, and birds tend to visit them more when there are fewer flowers in bloom. 

So on the whole, feeders are good. They also provide an easy way for people to connect with wildlife. 

But there's one big, big, caveat here: If your feeder is dirty, it could be harming, or even killing, the hummers that visit it, turning the feeder from a lifeline into a trap. Unless you're prepared to regularly clean your feeder, you're better off not having one. 

The problem is simple: If sugar water is left out too long, it will spoil, meaning it will attract and grow microbes. Some of those microbes are bad and can cause infections, including candida — a type of yeast that causes yeast infections in humans and, apparently, in hummingbirds. 

When hummers contract fungal infections, their tongues swell and become difficult to retract. That can put them at risk of starvation. Infected birds also sometimes appear with lesions on their beak or more generally lethargic, said Melanie Furr, a licensed wildlife rehabber who works with Wild Nest Bird Rehab in Georgia. 

“It's fairly common,” Furr told me. “I think it boils down to the fact that most people are not cleaning their feeders or refreshing their nectar as often as they should.” 

Other wildlife rehabbers have similarly indicated that many adult and baby hummingbirds are in need of rescue because of feeder-related infections. Furr says antifungal medication can clear up the infection and make them healthy enough for release.

Just as the problem is simple, the solution is thankfully simple, too. 

There are two key components to a healthy hummingbird feeder: the right recipe and regular cleaning. Both are incredibly straightforward. 

Mix 1 part refined white sugar with 4 parts drinking water, such as ¼ cup sugar with 1 cup water. Dissolve over heat and cool. 

Important notes: 

In spring and fall, you should be cleaning your feeder every two to three days. In the summer — or whenever it's hot — you should clean the feeder daily or every other day, Furr said.

“If you wouldn't leave your drink sitting out in the sun for three days and then drink it, don't do it for hummingbirds,” Furr said. “Why should a little, 3-gram hummingbird be expected to survive whatever germs are growing there?”

If you're changing out the nectar every few days, you can simply clean the feeder with hot water, she said. But if it's been a while, or you see or smell mold, scrub it down with a mixture of vinegar and water or using hydrogen peroxide. You should also make sure the feeder is completely dry before refilling it to prevent bacteria from growing, said Chad Witko, specialist in avian biology at the National Audubon Society.

“If you're going to commit to keeping it clean, it's a great idea,” Furr said of feeders. “Hummingbirds, like birds across every biome, are in decline. Habitat loss and lack of native plants present challenges to them. Having a clean feeder can provide an additional food resource that can be important.” 

Don't want to bother with cleaning? Or want to do more for your local hummers? 

Consider planting native hummingbird-friendly wildflowers. The National Audubon Society has a tool that tells you what to plant in your region to attract hummingbirds.

And if you come across an injured hummingbird, contact a local wildlife rehabber. This website is a good place to start.

Gen Z is reversing a major trend in religion.

A couple weeks ago, I did something I try to do at least once a month: I went to the church I'm a member of in person instead of online.

Growing up, church was a regular part of my life, and not just on Sundays. My father is a pastor, so it was common to spend a weekday evening doing my homework in my dad's office, music from choir rehearsal pouring in as I finished whatever worksheet was due the next day. It's an institution that shaped me: It's where I made a lot of friends, it gave me my first taste of public speaking, and since pastors in my denomination are moved from church to church, it also determined what city I lived in and where I went to school.

When I was a kid, attendance was obviously less in my control. If I didn't go to church on Sunday, that meant no hanging with friends the following week. “If you can't make time for the Lord, how can you make time for something else?” was my mother's refrain. 

The choice is mine now. I enjoy hearing the songs that were the soundtrack for so much of my childhood. I like saying hello to the people I see week after week. I like the Black liberation theology interpretation of the Bible that I hear every Sunday. 

And my experience, it turns out, is not unique. As we discussed in the most recent episode of Explain It to Me, Vox's call-in podcast, Gen Z has been finding religion these last few years. It's a phenomenon that reverses some recent trends — and one for which experts are trying to find an explanation. 

It's a development that Ryan Burge has been keeping his eye on. He was a Baptist pastor for 20 years, and now he's an associate professor of political science at Eastern Illinois University. 

Burge stepped away from ministry because the attendance in his church was declining: Members were aging, and there weren't a lot of young people to keep it alive.

“It's almost like every year, you expect [the share of Christians in the country] to be one point lower than the prior year, or two points lower than the prior year,” Burge told me. “Every generation is less Christian than the prior generation, going all the way back to the early 1900s. And what's fascinating is that the drop is very consistent.”

According to Burge, Catholicism is seeing a huge rise in young men.

Now, though, Burge says that not only is that decline tapering off, but “on some metrics, this data says that young people are actually more likely to be weekly religious attenders than millennials are. This is huge — we've never seen that before. We always assumed religion's going to continue to decline, and it doesn't look like that decline is continuing.”

When we asked Explain It to Me listeners about their own experiences with spirituality, we got a wide array of responses. 

“I did not grow up going to church. My family never went to church when I was younger, but I always had questions and felt like something bigger was out there,” one listener told us. “So as soon as I could drive myself, I went to church and started looking for those answers.” 

Another — a self-described “cradle Catholic” who has made her way back to religion — called in to say that, “I understand why a lot of young people are actually going back to religion. It's because there's no other place to turn to in order to see what's wrong with life.”

So what's behind this uptick? The hypotheses are legion. 

“To be a young person is to rebel against your parents,” Burge says. “In my generation it was like, ‘Oh, I grew up very hardcore Catholic or evangelical and so I became an atheist.' That was the most rebellious thing you can do. But imagine if you are a second-generation atheist or third-generation atheist. You know what the most rebellious thing you can do? It's to be Orthodox Christian or be Catholic.” 

Gender could also be at play. Through the years, more women have been regular church attendees than men, but we're not seeing that with Gen Z. According to Burge, Catholicism is seeing a huge rise in young men. “I wonder if politics might be driving this religious divide among young people. Women had Time's Up and Me Too. … I think a lot of men feel like they're being overlooked. And if you go to a Catholic church, it's one of the few places in society where men have a privileged position in that hierarchy.” 

That's a sentiment that was echoed recently during a young adult group at St. Dominic's Catholic Church in San Francisco. In the group, men outnumber women. Father Patrick Verney, who runs the group, acknowledges the shift. 

“This is very different from how it's always been in the past. In the past it's always been more women than men,” he said. “This particular trend that you're talking about is unique in the history of humanity in a certain respect, certainly in the history of Christianity.”

Israel-Hamas War:

The US no longer wholeheartedly endorses an independent state for Palestinians, Washington's ambassador to Israel said, adding that if one were to be formed it could be elsewhere in the region rather than the West Bank. 

“Unless there are some significant things that happen that change the culture, there's no room for it,” Mike Huckabee, an appointee of US President Donald Trump, said in an interview with Bloomberg in Jerusalem.

A model F-35 fighter jet at the Lockheed Martin booth at the Canadian Association of Defence & Security Industries (CANSEC) trade show in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, on Wednesday, May 28, 2025. 

Canada's purchase of 88 Lockheed Martin Corp. F-35 fighter jets will cost far more than projected, and the country faces a potential shortage of qualified pilots to fly them, a government audit has found.

The overall cost estimate of the order has jumped to C$27.7 billion ($20.2 billion), almost 50% more than originally anticipated, Canadian Auditor General Karen Hogan said in a report. There will be at least C$5.5 billion in additional costs for infrastructure upgrades and advanced weapons, she said.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Aggregate price targets for S&P 500 companies have started moving higher again, and that's usually a bullish sign.

Going up.

Wall Street analyst outlooks are typically bullish. If you aggregate every price target on every S&P 500 Index company and weight them to match the index, it's exceedingly rare for the overall number to fall. The so-called “bottom-up” price target did just that in April, a good measure of how shocking President Donald Trump's so-called Liberation Day tariffs were. The good news (potentially) is that the metric has started moving higher again. And when that happens, it's historically a sign that the bottom is in.

The basic story seems to be that America's tech superstars — the protagonists behind the “American exceptionalism” narrative — continue to excel, tariffs or no tariffs. On a sector basis, information technology price targets fell sharply from early April through May, but they've now bounced back from most of their losses, thanks no doubt to bullish earnings reports from Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Broadcom Inc. But it's not as if three companies are putting the entire index on their shoulders.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

On a Tuesday in March, it's egg white frittatas, Yukon gold potatoes and maple sausage; the next day, it's scrambled eggs, red potatoes and chicken sausage. There are yogurts and hand fruit scattered about for the truly health-conscious, and a drawer of bite-size lemon scones for those who are merely playing at it. The key constant is the tub of Hampton's malted vanilla waffle batter. In a now-familiar ritual, guests push a plastic tab to extrude the mix into a paper cup, drizzle it over a waffle iron, then flip the handle and watch the seconds tick down on a digital timer. As with almost everything at Hampton, the process has been rigorously engineered. Those little paper cups of batter are what peak hotel performance looks like.

Tune in to CNBC all week for ongoing coverage of this year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list.

Generative AI enterprise search startup Glean announced on Tuesday that it raised $150 million in a Series F financing, pushing up its valuation from investors by billions of dollars in less than a year, to $7.2 billion. 

The company's last fundraising in September 2024 valued Glean at $4.6 billion.

On Tuesday, Glean was also named to the CNBC Disruptor 50 list for the second-consecutive year.

Glean reported that its annual recurring revenue surpassed $100 million in its last fiscal year, ending Jan. 31, 2025 — less than three years after it was launched by a founding team that includes veterans from Google, Meta, and Dropbox.

""We're building the platform that brings AI into the fabric of everyday work, connecting people to knowledge, automating tasks, and enabling smarter decisions across the enterprise,"" said Arvind Jain, Glean co-founder and CEO, in a release announcing the deal.

In early 2025, Glean launched its agentic AI, Glean Agents, which the company says are on pace to support one billion agent actions by year-end.

The company's core product is an AI-powered enterprise search platform that integrates with a wide array of workplace apps — Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, and Salesforce. Glean uses natural language understanding and machine learning to create a personalized knowledge graph for each user, improving enterprise search results and the ability to generate content, while automating individual workflows and corporate processes. While initially focused on tech industry customers, Glean has expanded to finance, retail and manufacturing.

Jain told Deirdre Bosa, anchor of CNBC's ""TechCheck,"" that the capital will allow Glean to double the size of teams in R&D and sales as it pushes further into the large enterprise market, overseas markets, and into more partnerships similar to recent ones with companies including fellow Disruptor Databricks, Snowflake and Palo Alto Networks.

Jain said for many large enterprises across sectors of the economy, the gen AI boom is as much about concern as it is about excitement. ""Large enterprises are more worried about this. They don't want to be left behind,"" he told CNBC. ""The most important thing that I hear from businesses is they are trying to make sure that their workforce becomes AI-first,"" he added.

Wellington Management led the fundraising, with existing investors Capital One Ventures, Altimeter, Citi, Coatue, DST Global, General Catalyst, ICONIQ Growth, IVP, Kleiner Parkins, Latitude Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sapphire Ventures and Sequoia Capital, all participating in the deal. New investors included Khosla Ventures, Bicycle Capital, Geodesic and Archerman Capital.

While consumer-facing gen AI is growing the fastest — OpenAI says it is adding millions of users an hour, and on Monday reported annual recurring revenue above $10 billion — Jain said the enterprise market has to be thought of in distinct terms. ""You have to remember that models like ChatGPT, they don't know anything about your internal company's data,"" he said. ""We're able to actually use that context and combine it with the power of models to solve real business problems for you.""

OpenAI does have its own enterprise business, which recently passed the three-million user mark.

While Glean has seen exponential growth in recent years, it will continue to face challenges in a competitive market including Microsoft 365 Copilot, Amazon Q Business and ChatGPT Enterprise, along with offerings from fellow Disruptors Perplexity and Writer. Jain said in some cases its technology is not in competition with, but complementing the large language models being developed for the enterprise, such as fellow Disruptor Anthropic's Claude.

But the competition is intensifying from all sides and overlapping. ""Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, they all want to actually come into this space that we started,"" Jain said. ""We have a lead. We have deep enterprise technology that we built over these years. ... We have to keep innovating. And the good thing for Glean is that we're not building a product that's going to get commoditized,"" he said.

Currently based in Palo Alto, the company will soon be opening a new office in San Francisco to support its growth.

IBM on Tuesday announced a roadmap to develop a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer called Quantum Starling.

Part of the company's plan involves the new IBM Quantum Nighthawk processor, which is set to release later this year, according to a blog post announcing the details.

""Unlocking the full promise of quantum computing will require a device capable of running larger, deeper circuits with hundreds of millions of gates operating on hundreds of qubits, at least,"" the company said in a blog post. ""More than that, it will require a device capable of correcting errors and preventing them from spreading throughout the system. ... it will require a fault-tolerant quantum computer.

Fault tolerance refers to the system's ability to correct and deal with errors.

The quantum race accelerated this year after Google announced its breakthrough quantum chip ""Willow"" in December. Microsoft rolled out its first quantum chip Majorana 1 in February, and Amazon followed a week later with its ""Ocelot"" chip.

Quantum computing has received more attention and investment in recent years as experts say they are getting closer to a device that can actually solve problems faster than a traditional computer based on semiconductors.

Researchers say a working quantum computer will be a useful tool to simulate complicated physics or do math that could decipher encrypted data.

Quantum Starling will be built at the IBM Poughkeepsie Lab in New York.

IBM's new roadmap sets a timeline for building the components needed in the build, with a series of processors and adapters all named with the bird theme.

This year the company is building the Quantum Loon chip, followed by the Quantum Kookaburra, a quantum processor module, in 2026, the blog post said. The Quantum Cockatoo adapter is set for 2027.

The Quantum Nighthawk processor will replace the company's Quantum Heron processor, the company said in the post. IBM said Nighthawk can run quantum circuits with 5,000 gates, like the Heron, but plans to boost it to 15,000 gates by 2028.

Couples often feel like they have the same arguments over and over again. 

As a therapist, I've heard many couples describe how a seemingly minor disagreement can spiral into an intense fight that goes unresolved, and eventually repeats without changing or improving. Even when they're not fighting, these couples report an underlying tension between them that makes it difficult to enjoy their relationship. 

To break this pattern, I encourage them to start a ""relationship bank account,"" in which they make ""deposits"" when they're not in conflict. These deposits are actions that make the other person feel like their happiness is being prioritized.

The current account balance reflects how safe and secure couples feel in their relationship. A positive balance means they know they have the emotional ""funds"" to handle any surprise ""bills"" with a minimum of conflict; a negative balance means any unexpected ""charge"" can send them into a ""debt"" spiral that causes a blowout fight.

Ultimately, the goal is to make more deposits than withdrawals, with arguments becoming less intense and, eventually, less frequent.

I start this process by asking each partner what makes them feel loved and appreciated. Then we can determine what kinds of actions they can each take to make deposits into their relationship bank account. 

Here are four common ways to bolster your account:

It's easy for a relationship to fall into a familiar pattern of work, chores, kids, and screens. You might spend hours a day in close physical proximity to your partner, but you may not feel connected to them. If that's the case, check in and find a few minutes of connection. 

This can be as simple as turning to your partner and giving them your undivided attention for a few minutes. How was their day? How is that issue they were dealing with at work going? Are they feeling okay physically? Is there anything you can do to help? 

A random hug as you pass your partner in the kitchen. A kissy face emoji sent from work. An inexpensive but thoughtful gift. An unexpected compliment. Random acts are small things that require little effort, yet their effect on your partner can be outsized. 

These small deposits let your partner know you're thinking about them at times when they least expect it.

There's often one partner who always makes plans, and it's easy for them to start feeling underappreciated. Making an effort to switch up the roles can have a positive effect. 

Take on planning with something as simple as making dinner reservations at a favorite restaurant or as complicated as mapping out a weekend getaway. Even if the results aren't perfect, it shows that you're listening to your partner and addressing their needs.

Most people assume that intimacy means sex, but sex is simply a form of intimacy. Intimacy means having an emotional connection and a feeling of closeness.

The actions we've explored so far can make your partner feel seen and supported, which can lead to an emotional connection, which can lead to emotionally meaningful sex — all of which can add to the balance in your relationship bank account. 

The deposits above are often missing in unhappy relationships. In my experience, couples tend to overlook these small actions more and more over time. The longer you've been in a relationship, the more likely you are to encounter a low balance — or an overdraft — in your relationship bank account.  

The key is to break through any resistance you might feel, and remember how impactful the little things can be when they add up. By making small, regular deposits into your relationship bank account, you're building up savings when times are good — and giving yourselves a cushion to withdraw from when they're not.

U.S. tourists seem to be cutting back on summer trips to Europe — but Chinese travelers are more than making up for it, a study found.

Data from the European Travel Commission (ETC) published Tuesday showed that just 33% of U.S. survey respondents were planning to visit Europe this summer, some 7% below the levels of last year.

The decline appears to largely relate to funding, with 54% of those polled citing high travel costs as a barrier.

But political concerns, including those around the perception of the U.S. abroad, also appear to be weighing on plans, the ETC said.

""Travel sentiment is strongest among Americans from the Northeast (43% vs. 33% in the total sample), a region that typically leans Democratic and diverges politically from Trump,"" the organization noted.

Popular European tourist destinations usually welcome millions of visitors from the U.S. each year. U.S. tourists in the U.K. in 2023 for example totaled a record 5.1 million, while U.S. visitors were among the top five countries bringing the most cash into the French economy last year.

The decline in interest in a European summer isn't limited to U.S. travelers. Around 39% of total respondents to the ETC's survey said they were planning such a holiday in 2025, compared to 41% in 2024. Sentiment around European travel has also pulled back among travelers from Brazil, Canada and Japan.

But interest in European summer trips shot up among Chinese travelers, with 72% of survey respondents from the country saying they were planning such a holiday — up 10% from the previous year.

""The strong sentiment is supported by growing disposable incomes, favourable travel policies, and a consumer shift toward prioritising personal fulfilment and lifestyle experiences such as tourism,"" the ETC said.

The National Bureau of Statistics of China earlier this year said that the nationwide per capita disposable income grew by more than 5% over the previous year in the first quarter of 2025. Domestically, concerns have nevertheless mounted over the resilience of the Chinese consumer: weak consumer demand drove prices lower recently, while retail sales growth slowed in April.

Europe has long been a key destination for Chinese tourists, with many looking to buy luxury goods whilst away. This trend came to a screeching halt during the Covid-19 pandemic, but could be picking back up now.

Over half of Chinese travelers now say that shopping is part of their European travel plans, according to the ETC data. Yet, the figures also suggest that travelers might be shifting their spending patterns, with Chinese tourists now especially likelier to tighten the belt. Just 29% of them are expecting to spend more than 200 euros ($229) a day, a 44% drop compared to last year. Instead, the majority of Chinese visitors is now looking to spend between 100 and 200 euros per day.

Paramount Global is cutting its U.S.-based staff by 3.5%, or several hundred employees, in the latest round of layoffs at the media company as it contends with the decline of the traditional pay-TV bundle and macroeconomic headwinds.

The company notified its staff of the impending layoffs on Tuesday morning, according to a memo viewed by CNBC. The memo, which came from the office of the CEO — George Cheeks, Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins — said the majority of the impacted staff will be notified on Tuesday.

The layoffs also come as Paramount has been in the process of seeking regulatory approval for its proposed merger with Skydance Media, which has been held up by a legal battle between Paramount-owned CBS and the Trump administration over a ""60 Minutes"" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. 

Last June the trio of CEOs presented a go-forward plan that had included job cuts and reduced spending. In August, Paramount began the process of reducing its U.S.-based workforce by 15%.

In Tuesday's memo the CEOs said that the process may also result in some impacts to the workforce outside of the U.S. over time.

""We recognize how difficult this is and are very thankful for everyone's hard work and contributions. These changes are necessary to address the environment we are operating in and best position Paramount for success,"" the CEOs said in the memo.

Layoffs have been taking place across the media industry in recent weeks, with reported headcount reductions at Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery.

Paramount employed roughly 18,600 full- and part-time employees globally as of December, before recent cuts, according to the regulatory filing.

Meta is forming a new artificial intelligence research lab and bringing on Alexandr Wang, founder and CEO of the startup Scale AI, according to The New York Times.

The research lab is going to pursue a concept known as ""superintelligence,"" which is an AI system that surpasses human intelligence, the Times reported Tuesday. Meta is also in advanced talks to invest more than $10 billion in Scale AI, according to a report from Bloomberg.

Scale AI declined to comment. Meta did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

The reported research lab is Meta's latest effort to gain an edge in the fiercely competitive AI development space. Meta has been pouring billions of dollars into the technology, announcing plans to spend as much as $65 billion in capital expenditures for AI infrastructure this year. 

Late last month, Meta announced that its AI assistant supports 1 billion monthly active users across the company's family of apps. In February, CNBC reported that Meta was planning to debut a stand-alone Meta AI app during the second quarter and test a paid subscription service akin to rival chat apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Shares of Meta were up about 1% on Tuesday.

Tune in to CNBC all week for ongoing coverage of this year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list.

This year's Disruptor 50 list, topped by Anduril in the No. 1 spot, and then OpenAI, showcases 50 companies that are challenging the status quo and using technology (most often, AI) to transform a range of industries.

What's particularly notable about this year's list is how the sectors represented illustrate key trends not just in technology and VC, but also in politics and society. This is the first time in the 13 years of the Disruptor 50 list that it's been topped by a defense tech company. The defense tech sector isn't just represented by Anduril, with Flock Safety, Saronic Technologies and Shield AI also making the 2025 list.

Their scope and scale demonstrate a rising trend. The four companies have a combined value of more than $45 billion and have raised almost $10 billion from investors. They have geographic diversity – all are headquartered outside Silicon Valley. And their focuses are varied. Flock Safety (No. 7 on this year's list) makes security hardware and software. Saronic (No. 19) builds unmanned maritime vessels. Shield AI (No. 38) is an autonomous drone company.

Beyond the companies focused on building physical methods of defense, there is also Abnormal AI (No. 25), a cybersecurity company playing a key role in protecting systems from attacks that prey on human behavioral weaknesses. Gecko Robotics (No. 30) deploys its robots to capture data about the integrity of critical assets, including aircraft carriers, naval ships and missile silos. 

The sector's growth is expected to accelerate thanks to a surge of funding. Last week, Anduril announced a new $2.5 billion round of funding at a valuation — $30.5 billion — that is double the valuation of its previous round of funding. Saronic and Shield AI have also closed major fundraising rounds in 2025, according to Pitchbook; $600 million in Saronic's case.

AI infrastructure company Scale AI (No. 28) secured a landmark deal last August with the Department of Defense's Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office to advance AI capabilities for the U.S. military. Scale AI also announced a new multimillion-dollar deal with the DOD in March to help with ""Thunderforge,"" an initiative to develop AI agents for U.S. military planning and operations that also includes Anduril.

The surge in funding comes as President Donald Trump has proposed an increase in defense spending, with a focus on modernizing military capabilities and opening opportunities beyond the legacy defense sector. There is also an increasing focus on dual-use technologies: Anduril took over Microsoft's augmented reality headset program that was in the works with the military, and then at the end of May announced a deal with Meta to create VR and AR devices for use by the Army.

Along with the rise of military tech, the explosion in generative AI's capabilities is driving the transformation of a range of sectors, from farming to law and robotics. Across the list, there are 17 enterprise tech companies, seven fintechs, four health-care companies, four in food/agriculture, and three each in transportation and biotech. 

Artificial intelligence-focused investments and higher valuations are on full display up and down this year's Disruptor 50 list. The 13th annual Disruptor 50 class is valued at $798 billion, far more than last year's $436 billion total, due in large part to OpenAI's $300 billion valuation. The total amount the companies have raised increased to $127 billion, up from $70 billion last year.

It's clear that the generative AI revolution has transformed the startup ecosystem as well as the list, with 20 newcomers this year. Only 11 companies on this year's list were Disruptors before the launch of ChatGPT, and many in that group — including Anduril, Databricks and Canva — have succeeded because of their embrace of gen AI.

More than two-thirds of companies on this year's D50 list — 38 companies — said that AI is ""critical to their business,"" up from 34 last year. And 21 of this year's companies say generative AI is their essential technology, up from 13 last year.

This reflects venture capital's increasing focus on AI: about 58% of global VC dollars invested in the first quarter went into AI and machine learning startups, while in North America, 70% of deal value went into AI and machine learning startups. And the funding numbers continue to grow, with $73 billion raised in the first quarter, more than half of last year's total, though that's largely due to OpenAI's $40 billion round, led by SoftBank.

AI is being used in a range of diverse use cases by Disruptors, including law (Harvey), fighting crime (Flock Safety), and in the doctor's office (Abridge and Rad AI). But the sector with the most companies on this year's Disruptor 50 list is enterprise AI, with 17 companies (up from 14 last year). These range from Databricks, which helps companies mine their data, to Glean, which enables its customers to build custom AI apps and custom search tools, to collaborative workspace and note-taking tool Notion.

Design platform Canva has increasingly invested in artificial intelligence and made AI features the center of its toolkit. With partnerships with ChatGPT and Anthropic (No. 4 on this year's list), and the acquisition of several AI-powered companies in the past year, CEO Melanie Perkins is expected to take her $32 billion company public in the next year. ""We've continuously been investing in this space with magic recommendations, and so forth, over the years with generative AI,"" said Perkins. ""Being able to have that magic embedded as you're writing your documents and your presentations, being able to have Canva AI … it's really been an extension of that initial promise that we've had to customers, to empower the world, to design, to continue to put the latest to greatest technology in their hands."" 

Perkins says Canva has a three-pronged approach to AI: integrating the best products that are available, deeply investing in the areas needed to bring the expertise to their customers, and having a platform where the newest AI products and other apps can come onto Canva and be accessed by the community.

She is optimistic about the potential for AI to be a democratizing force for Canva's 220 million customers around the world. ""I think it's critically important that as the world of humanity, we use AI to truly lift up every single person who lives here, to help everyone have their basic human needs being met,"" she said. ""And I think there is a huge opportunity for us to be dreaming bigger about what we want with technology accelerating. I think there is a huge opportunity to rethink what we're doing with it and ensuring that it's serving our needs.""

Tune in to CNBC all week for ongoing coverage of this year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list.

The race for global supremacy in AI and the existential threat it represents to the status quo in the tech industry, and beyond, has led to record venture investment in startups.

The top five companies on this year's Disruptor 50 list — including a new No. 1 Disruptor from the defense tech sector — have a combined valuation of just under $500 billion. That is more than the combined total valuation of almost every past Disruptor 50 list over the last 12 years.

One recently hauled in the largest VC round ever, and as consumer and business use of artificial intelligence rapidly grows, more are using their cash to become aggressive acquirers, as they exponentially scale their generative AI business models.

But it's never just about the money or size in the Disruptor 50 selection process, and it is far from all agentic AI and chatbots, with new business models emerging in a wide range of areas, from agriculture to autonomous transportation and health care.

It is increasingly about the new gen AI era, which began transforming the Disruptor 50 list in 2023, and hasn't slowed down since. Twenty of this year's 50 companies have made the list for the first time, while another 19 were first-timers in either 2023 or 2024. For most, embracing the new era is what has kept them here.

In all, the 2025 Disruptors have raised $127 billion at a total implied valuation $798 billion.

French artificial intelligence firm Mistral is on Tuesday launching its first reasoning model to compete with rival options from the likes of OpenAI and China's DeepSeek.

""We're announcing in a couple of hours our new reasoning model, which is very much competitive with all the others and has the specificity of being able to reason in multiple languages,"" CEO Arthur Mensch told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal onstage during a fireside chat at London Tech Week.

Reasoning models are systems that can execute more complicated tasks through a step-by-step logical thought process. Mistral's new model ""is great at mathematics [and] great at coding,"" according to Mensch.

Other reasoning models on the market currently include OpenAI's o1, which was released to users of its ChatGPT service late last year and Chinese AI lab DeepSeek's R1.

Mistral, which is backed by U.S. tech giant Microsoft, specializes in so-called open-weight large language models. These are systems that make their underlying ""parameters"" — elements that are adjusted during training to improve performance — publicly available.

This essentially enables developers to access and modify the model's core knowledge and bypass the high costs and time associated with training a system from scratch.

Mistral's CEO said that the unique selling point of its upcoming Magistral reasoning model is that it will be able to reason with European languages. ""Historically, we've seen U.S. models reason in English and Chinese models reason in Chinese,"" he said.

While it's focusing on European languages for now, Mensch added that Mistral will add support for more languages later down the line.

At the start of this year, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek released a reasoning model called R1 that shocked the AI community — and global markets — promising competitive performance with OpenAI's rival o1 model at a lower cost.

The World Bank sharply cut its global economic growth projections Tuesday, citing disruption from trade uncertainty in particular.

It now expects the global economy to expand by 2.3% in 2025, down from an earlier forecast of 2.7%.

""This would mark the slowest rate of global growth since 2008, aside from outright global recessions,"" the Bank said in its Global Economic Prospects report.

Trade uncertainty, especially, has weighed on the outlook, the World Bank suggested.

""International discord — about trade, in particular — has upended many of the policy certainties that helped shrink extreme poverty and expand prosperity after the end of World War II,"" Indermit Gill, senior vice president and chief economist of The World Bank Group, said in the report.

It also cut its 2025 growth forecast for the U.S. by 0.9 percentage points to 1.4%, and reduced its euro area GDP expectations by 0.3 percentage points to 0.7%.   

The Bank noted that an escalation of trade tensions could push growth even lower, but the picture could improve if major economies strike lasting trade agreements.

""Our analysis suggests that if today's trade disputes were resolved with agreements that halve tariffs relative to their levels in late May, 2025, global growth could be stronger by about 0.2 percentage point on average over the course of 2025 and 2026,"" Gill said.

The U.S. and many of its trading partners are currently in negotiations after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on numerous countries in April. This week, for example, the U.S. and China are meeting in London after the two countries agreed to temporarily reduce levies following talks in May.

Negotiations are also still ongoing between the U.S. and European Union with less than a month to go before previously announced tariffs are set to come into full force.

In cutting its global growth expectation, the World Bank follows various other bodies, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which also cited the fallout from trade and tariff-related uncertainty as the key factor.

The OECD said earlier this month that it was expecting global growth to slow to 2.9% in 2025, also caveating its forecast with the potential for future tariff developments. It had previously forecast global growth of 3.1% this year.

American fund managers are lobbying Congress over a provision tucked inside President Donald Trump's tax bill that they say could lead to foreign investors ""quickly"" pulling investments out of the U.S.

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" which passed through the U.S. House of Representatives in May, aims to penalize foreign-owned firms operating in the U.S. and that are from countries with ""unfair foreign taxes"" under a provision known as Section 899. It is currently being considered by the Senate.

The Investment Company Institute (ICI), which represents fund houses in the U.S., is lobbying Congress for an amendment as it warns the bill in its current form also impacts most foreign investments in U.S. stock markets, according to documents seen by CNBC.

""In order to avoid the impact of section 899, portfolio investors are likely to retreat quickly from US equities, leading to capital outflows from the United States,"" the ICI said in a letter sent to Senator Mike Crapo, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, on June 5. ""If sustained selling by foreign investors depresses US equity markets, this would harm both US companies and investors.""

Section 899 aims to introduce retaliatory tax measures against entities from countries that have levies such as the Digital Services Taxes and the OECD's global minimum tax rules. If signed into law, it could impact investors from the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Switzerland, among others.

The tax would start at 5% and escalate by five percentage points annually to a maximum of 20%, on top of existing taxes, which vary by country and tax treaties. That could dent returns for foreign investors in U.S. equities.

In the letter, the ICI also suggests that the U.S. fund management industry, which has collectively invested around $18 trillion in U.S. stock markets, would be ""collateral damage"" due to the impact of Section 899.

""We do believe, however, that the current drafting of proposed section 899 should clarify its scope and avoid discouraging foreign investment in US equity markets through 'investment funds' such as US mutual funds and ETFs and their foreign counterparts (e.g., UCITS funds),"" the ICI said.

The letter to Senators goes on to say, ""section 899 would penalize these funds and their shareholders by taxing passive income from US equity investments. To this end, investment funds would be collateral damage to the intended focus of section 899.""

Funds typically charge fees as a percentage of assets under management, and a withdrawal by foreign investors, over Section 899 concerns, could lead to lower earnings for the investment management firm.

The Senate Finance Committee declined to comment, and Senator Mike Crapo's office did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Foreign investors own $19 trillion in the U.S. stock markets, $7 trillion in U.S. government bonds, and $5 trillion in U.S. credit, according to data compiled by Apollo Global Management.

The ICI said it's largely in support of the U.S. government's attempt to ""protect US business interests overseas and to address discriminatory foreign taxes."" However, it cautions that the current draft of the bill does the opposite.

""Some foreign governments may actually cheer this capital flight from the United States because it benefits their local equity markets, which is not the behavioral incentive that Section 899 seeks to achieve,"" it said.

Yuri Khodjamirian, chief investment officer for Tema ETFs, said investors in Europe who are focused on dividend-distributing U.S. companies would be ""thinking quite carefully"" about their holdings at this stage.

""If suddenly you have to pay tax on that income, why would you hold that?"" Khodjamirian questioned. Tema ETFs runs the American Reshoring ETF that is available to both U.S. and foreign professional investors.

Tax experts suggest earnings paid out to foreign investors are more likely to be hit by Section 899 than capital gains and other methods of shareholder distributions.

The Tema ETFs investment chief cautioned that the impact on the U.S. equities market would be relatively minimal as U.S. companies, say in the S&P 500, are typically not known for their dividends.

""In the US, dividend yields are quite low. There's not a lot of companies paying. And most of the capital gets returned as share buybacks,"" Khodjamirian told CNBC. ""Is that actually going to be that big of an issue then?""

Uber on Tuesday announced it's partnered with self-driving car technology firm Wayve to launch trials of fully autonomous rides in the U.K., starting in spring 2026.

The ride-hailing app said the pilot would be the first of its kind for the company, as it allow users to take Uber rides without a safety driver present — a standard of autonomous driving described by the industry as ""Level 4."" 

Self-driving vehicles have become a common sight in San Francisco, where Google's autonomous driving venture Waymo offers a commercial ride-hailing service with its driverless cars. However, other global players are racing to roll out so-called ""robotaxi"" services of their own. 

Andrew MacDonald, president and chief operating officer of Uber, said the partnership with Wayve would move the company a step closer toward its vision ""to make autonomy a safe and reliable option for riders everywhere.""

""This is a defining moment for UK autonomy,"" Wayve CEO and co-founder Alex Kendall said in a statement. ""With Uber and a global OEM partner, we're preparing to put our AI Driver technology into real service on the streets of London.""

Uber said it was able to launch the pilot in the U.K. thanks to an ""accelerated framework"" for self-driving commercial pilots that's being introduced by the U.K.'s Department of Transport.

Uber and Wayve said they would work closely with the government and Transport for London — which is the main authority overseeing transport in the U.K. capital — on regulatory approvals and permissions prior to launching the trials.

Backed by SoftBank, Wayve is a London-based startup that develops software to enable self-driving vehicles. Its platform uses artificial intelligence to allow cars to assess their surroundings and it's designed to be applicable in any environment.

Last year, the U.K. passed its Autonomous Vehicles Act into law, which the government at the time said would pave the way for self-driving vehicles to arrive on British roads by 2026.

Temu and Shein are pivoting to Europe as their business in the U.S. takes a major hit from unfavorable trade policies. But the China-founded budget e-commerce apps may not receive a warm reception in their new target markets. 

In recent weeks, complaints have been filed against Temu and Shein in the EU, accusing them of unsavory business tactics. That comes as the bloc prepares a new two-euro flat fee on previously customs-free small packages from online marketplaces like Temu and Shein. 

Experts say the new developments could be ominous signs for the platforms, as their business has already suffered from the May closure of a small package tariff exemption in the U.S., as well as new duties at 54%, or $100 for those sent through the postal service. 

""As regulatory and trade pressures intensify in the U.S., Temu and Shein are increasingly turning to Europe and the UK as critical growth markets,"" Anand Kumar, associate director of research at Coresight Research, told CNBC. 

However, Kumar said that the companies have begun to face regulatory headwinds in Europe and the U.K. that echo the scrutiny they've encountered in the U.S. 

""The EU's proposed €2 customs fee is more than a minor surcharge—it's a strategic regulatory move aimed at curbing the unchecked growth of ultra-cheap cross-border e-commerce, and it could reshape how platforms like Shein and Temu operate in Europe over the next 2–3 years,"" he added. 

Temu and Shein have boosted their ad spending in Europe, particularly in the U.K. and France, according to a report from Reuters, reflecting their shift away from the U.S.

The growing importance of the EU and U.K. to the two companies has also been reflected in data from Consumer Edge Research, which traces consumer trends based on a sample of credit and debit card info. 

According to the data it sent to CNBC, Temu's consumer spending in the U.S. fell about 36% in May from a year earlier, while Shein's fell 13% over the same period. The company added that its data shows that some of Temu and Shein's U.S. customers have shifted their spending toward legacy department stores and fast fashion retailers. 

Those trends coincide with data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower showing that app usage of Temu and Shein in the U.S. is slowing significantly.

However, the opposite trends for the platforms were observed in the U.K. and EU. In May, year-over-year consumer spending growth reached 63% in the EU and 38% in the U.K. Shein experienced growth of 19% in the EU and 42% in the U.K. over the same period. 

For Temu, Consumer Edge data showed that growth was especially pronounced in the key market of France, Europe's second-largest economy.  

To capitalize on the momentum in Europe, Temu and Shein have been aggressively expanding their operations across the region, including ramping up warehouse capacity, experimenting with localized business models, as well as significantly increasing digital ad spending in key markets like the U.K., France and Germany, according to Coresight's Kumar. 

""This expansion is not merely opportunistic—it signals a strategic shift in how these companies envision their next phase of growth,"" he said. 

""That said, the European market is not without its challenges. The region enforces stricter regulations on product safety, consumer protection, and fair competition, all of which require Temu and Shein to invest more in compliance and operational transparency,"" he added. 

Experts say that those challenges and the EU's potential duties on small-value packages may be signs of more pressures to come for Temu and Shein. 

According to French local media, the wording of an ""anti-fast fashion"" bill, which is under debate in the French National Assembly, was recently rewritten to single out ultra-cheap platforms like Shein and Temu. 

The bill, first approved by France's lower house of parliament in March last year, seeks to penalize fast-fashion products for their environmental impact.

Meanwhile, on Thursday, the pan-European consumer organization BEUC filed a complaint with the European Commission against Shein over its use of deceptive techniques, or ""dark patterns"" that cause overconsumption. 

That comes after the European Commission announced its own investigation into Shein's compliance with EU consumer law in February and, in May, urged Shein to respect EU consumer protection laws. 

BEUC has also filed a complaint against Temu, while 17 of its members filed the same complaint with their competent national authorities, the group said. 

Xiaomeng Lu, director of geotechnology at Eurasia Group, told CNBC that the latest scrutiny Temu and Shein are experiencing in the EU is reminiscent of that in the U.S. 

""[Temu and Shein] offer cost effective solutions and an efficient supply network that fare well in the fast moving fashion world. However their labor practices and human rights standards may not fully align with high value markets like the EU and U.S.,"" Lu said. 

That conflict and ""rising protectionism"" globally are the ""key drivers of these regulatory reactions,"" she added.

In the U.S., officials had also taken issue with Temu over its alleged non-compliance with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which prohibits the import of goods made with forced labor from China's Xinjiang region.

According to Coresight's Kumar, Europe, for its part, is progressing toward stricter oversight through the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive — which EU member states have until July 2026 to integrate into their national laws. 

The directive would compel companies operating in the EU to identify and mitigate human rights abuses in their supply chains, disclose environmental impact and sustainability metrics and face legal consequences for failing to take adequate preventive steps.

That means Temu and Shein will face stringent compliance demands in the EU, Kumar said. However, the region still offers meaningful opportunities for expansion in an increasingly protectionist global trade environment, he added.

 The Bank of Japan's June meeting could trigger a Bitcoin rally if it restarts quantitative easing, as bond yield concerns push institutions toward BTC as a hedge. 

The Bank of Japan's (BOJ) upcoming monetary policy meeting in June may provide the next significant catalyst for global risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies.

The BoJ is set to take its next interest rate decision at its upcoming monetary policy meeting on June 16–17.

The central bank may provide the next significant catalyst for Bitcoin (BTC) and other risk assets if it pivots to quantitative easing (QE), according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and chief investment officer of Maelstrom.

“If the BOJ delays QT, and restarts selected QE at its June meeting risk assets are going to fly,” Hayes wrote in a June 10 X post.

QE refers to central banks buying bonds and pumping money into the economy to lower interest rates and encourage spending during difficult financial conditions.

On July 31, 2024, the Bank of Japan introduced a plan to cut government bond purchases by 400 billion yen per quarter, starting in August 2024. The quantitative tightening plan is set for an interim assessment period at the upcoming meeting on June 16, signaling a potential opportunity to pivot.

BoJ officials are reportedly discussing making smaller reductions to the bank's bond buying, from the current 400 billion to 200 billion yen per quarter, starting from April 2027, unnamed sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.

Bitcoin rose to the $112,000 all-time high on May 22, two days after the 30-year yield on Japanese bonds reached a new all-time high of 3.185% on May 20, 2025.

The concerns around Japan's sovereign bond market inspired institutions to reconsider Bitcoin's role as a hedge against sovereign default risks, according to Bitwise's head of European research, André Dragosch.

“Perceived default risk continues rising, yields continue rising? This is a rough benchmark of why Bitcoin could be heading toward $200,000,” Dragosch told Cointelegraph, adding that Bitcoin is “free from counterparty risk.”

Government bonds are typically considered safe-haven assets. But when yields rise sharply, it often signals investor concerns about fiscal sustainability and repayment risk.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) climbed toward a new high on Tuesday as investors continue to bet on the Trump administration's friendly stance toward the crypto industry and companies increasingly add the token to their balance sheets.

As of 1 pm ET, the token was trading just below $109,000, roughly $3,000 away from touching its all-time intraday high in May.

Greater adoption of the token has been driven in part by dozens of public companies getting on the bitcoin bandwagon. 

""Over time, bitcoin has proven itself to be a better hedge against inflation than many other asset classes,"" said Elliot Johnson, CEO of Bitcoin Treasury Corp., an advisory firm that helps companies acquire and hold bitcoin as part of their balance sheets.

Johnson points out over the past five years, bitcoin is up over 1,000% while gold has returned about 92.5%.

""Meanwhile, the US dollar has lost more than 20% of its value over the last five years due to inflation,"" said Johnson.

However, the strategy spearheaded by Strategy and copied by dozens of companies, carries risks.

“The main risk in running a leveraged 'bitcoin treasury' strategy is that a rapid drop in the price of bitcoin would lead to a possibility of bankruptcy,” NYU Stern School of Business professor David Yermack told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview. 

On Monday, shares of bitcoin juggernaut Strategy (MSTR) jumped more than 4% after the company said it purchased 1,045 more tokens from June 2 to June 8, with total holdings now worth more than $62 billion, according to Bloomberg data.

But “MSTR's scale is hard to replicate,” Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani wrote in a May note. “Not every Bitcoin treasury will be successful simply replicating MSTR's playbook, in our view.”

Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) shares fell more than 10% during one session in May after the Trump-backed company announced plans to create what it claims will be one of the largest bitcoin treasuries held by any public company.

GameStop (GME) stock also slid nearly 25% immediately after the company announced in March it would raise $1.3 billion to buy bitcoin.

Around 80 companies have adopted the so-called ""bitcoin standard"" by adding the token to their balance sheets. Corporates now hold roughly 3.4% of all tokens in circulation, according to Bernstein analysis.

""Bitcoin is great, we love it and still believe $200K is our high-conviction but conservative price forecast this cycle,"" wrote Bernstein's Chhugan on Monday.

The cryptocurrency is up more than 55% since President Trump, who promised a crypto-friendly framework, was elected last November.

Trump's first order of business when he reentered the White House included the placement of a crypto-friendly advocate to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, and appointing a crypto-czar. 

Legislation in the Congress — which if passed, would regulate stablecoins, or digital assets backed by the US dollar — has lifted optimism over the crypto space. Senate Republicans are aiming to pass the bill this week.

 The amount of Ethereum now staked is almost 30% of the current circulating supply, reaching a new record this week. 

Staked Ethereum has clocked a new record as the asset's price reclaimed a 12-day high amid major institutional accumulation. 

The amount of Ether (ETH) staked on the Beacon Chain reached a record high of 34.65 million ETH on Sunday, eclipsing the previous high on Nov. 10, 2024. 

The amount of Ether staked has been relatively stable, above 33 million for the past year. However, it started to tick up again in June, according to the network explorer Beaconcha.in.

The higher staking level indicates that more holders are not prepared to sell at current levels, preferring a yield from staking instead. 

A Dune Analytics dashboard confirmed the record figure, reporting that 34.8 million ETH was staked as of Monday, while Ultrasound.Money reports 34.7 million staked. 

The analytics platform also reports that the current amount staked is equivalent to 28.7% of the current circulating supply of Ether, which is 120.8 million, as issuance returned to inflationary in February. 

The milestone also comes as the industry anticipates the approval of spot Ether ETF staking by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

Analysts have suggested that staked Ether ETFs could debut “within the next few weeks,” following a recent filing by ETF provider REX Shares that used “regulatory workarounds.”

Meanwhile, BlackRock's industry-leading iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has been aggressively accumulating the asset with 23 consecutive trading days without an outflow, according to Farside Investors.  

The amount of Ethereum staked has surged 77% over the past two years despite the asset's lackluster price performance, which has seen a gain of around 50% over the same period but nowhere near a new all-time high.

However, ETH prices had gained more than 8% on the day to reclaim $2,700 on Tuesday, its highest price since May 29, almost a fortnight ago. 

The $2,700 price zone has served as resistance four times over the past month, so this needs to be broken for momentum to continue.

Crypto analyst Crypto Bullet has raised the possibility of the Ethereum price surging by 38% soon. He alluded to the 50EMA as the only thing holding ETH from witnessing this price surge, but suggested that it could change soon with a breakout on the horizon. 

Ethereum Price Eyes 38% Jump To $3,500

In an X post, Crypto Bullet predicted that the Ethereum price could record a 38% surge to $3,500. This came following as he highlighted the ongoing battle between ETH and the 50EMA, noting that this indicator was the only thing holding the altcoin back from a parabolic surge. The analyst added that on average, a breakout results in a 38% pump, which puts Ethereum exactly at $3,500. 

As NewsBTC reported, Crypto Bullet also recently predicted that the Ethereum price could rally to $3,300 as a Morningstar Candle pattern formed. Back then, he noted that ETH was facing tough resistance at $2,500 but affirmed that the resistance would be broken in due time. He indicated that a breakout from that resistance will usher in the rally to $3,300. 

The Ethereum price has now broken above the $2,500 resistance, which provides a bullish outlook for the largest altcoin by market cap. Based on Crypto Bullet's prediction, a rally to $3,300 may already be underway, which could then lead ETH to the $3,500 target. In a more recent X post, the crypto analyst commented on the recent break above $2,500. 

He stated that the Ethereum price is now trying to break the 200-day MA, which is between $3,000 and $3,300, for the fifth time. He indicated that a breakout above the range is likely to happen on this fifth attempt. His accompanying showed that ETH could rally to the $4,000 level if a successful breakout occurs. 

ETH About To Begin A New Bull Run

Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade predicted that another bull run is about to start for the Ethereum price. He noted that ETH's daily candle closed above the resistance level at $2,650 yesterday and also opened above this resistance level today. The analyst added that ETH is now moving above it, which signals the start of a new bull run.

His accompanying chart showed that the Ethereum price is breaking out of an ascending triangle, which could send the altcoin above the psychological $3,000 level. Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also declared that Ethereum's breakout will be huge, with ETH still maintaining its current range between $2,400 and $2,600. 

At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,670, up over 7% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Ethereum is gaining momentum as institutional investors begin to diversify away from Bitcoin, according to analysts at B2BINPAY.

Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of a potential bull run, as institutions prepare to diversify from Bitcoin (BTC). On June 10, B2BINPAY analysts shared their insights with crypto.news, the same day Ethereum reached a record level of staking balance.

According to data from beaconcha.in, the amount of staked Ethereum hit an ATH of 34.65 million ETH, accounting for 28.7% of the total circulating supply. This milestone coincided with an 8% increase in ETH's price on the same day. Simultaneously, Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded their 15th consecutive day of net inflows, totalling $837 million.

B2BINPAY analysts say this data suggests institutions may be preparing to rotate capital from Bitcoin into Ethereum, a shift that could significantly increase ETH's market dominance and support gains in other altcoins as well.

“It's also worth noting that just recently, on June 3, BlackRock sold $130.4 million worth of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, this week alone, we've seen over $100 million in ETH purchases, which is a strong signal that institutional investors may be preparing to rotate capital into Ethereum,” B2BINPAY analysts.

In this context, Ethereum has the potential to build further bullish momentum, according to B2BINPAY. As long as ETH holds above the $2,320 support level, a breakdown below $2,000 is unlikely. However, further upside remains in focus.

“If Ethereum follows a bullish path and breaks through the $2,793 resistance, a move toward the $3,500-$4,000 range becomes a very realistic scenario — and in our view, the more probable one”, B2BINPAY analysts. 

Ethereum offers staking income to holders, making it attractive to institutional investors. Unlike Bitcoin, which relies solely on price appreciation to generate returns, ETH provides yield, allowing investors to earn passive income without needing to sell their holdings.

Binance and Coinbase secure over 15% of staked ETH, spotlighting centralized staking influence.

Staked ETH has reached a new all-time high of 34,824,875 ETH. The total represents 28.15% of the Ethereum supply now locked in staking contracts.

The validator count stands at 1,088,277, and staking activity is pushing upward after a period of consolidation and a brief decline earlier in the month.

Lido remains the leading staking entity, with 8.94 million ETH staked, accounting for 25.6% of the total market share. Centralized exchanges Binance and Coinbase follow, with 2.65 million and 2.59 million ETH staked, respectively, representing a combined share of over 15%.

Notably, ether.fi, a liquid restaking platform, continues to gain traction with 2.25 million ETH, up 16% over the past month.

Beaconcha.in data shows consistent staking growth since Ethereum's Beacon Chain launch, with accelerated deposits following the Merge, Shapella, and Dencun upgrades. The staking rate has climbed steadily over the past year, coinciding with more sophisticated restaking strategies and the expansion of staking service providers.

The staking milestone arrives as the ETH price surged 9.5% in the past 24 hours to $2,758. The move follows a temporary plateau earlier this month, rising market volumes, and upward momentum since June 9.

Despite Lido's dominance, its share is down 2% over the past month and 9% over six months, reflecting broader diversification in the staking landscape.

Platforms such as Blockdaemon and Rocket Pool show strong medium-term growth, with the former up 85% over six months, signaling increased adoption of decentralized and institutional staking options.

By James Van Straten  (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)Bitcoin BTC$108,810.73 treasury-holding companies continue to be a significant driver of momentum as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap trades just below the $110,000 mark, up 2% in the past 24 hours, and just 2% short of the record high it set last month. 

Even so, it's underperforming the broader market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, which has gained 3.4%, and ether ETH$2,740.87, which is more than 6% higher, according to CoinDesk data.

According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, the number of publicly listed companies holding bitcoin as a treasury asset has risen to 126, that's growth of 22 in just 30 days. Collectively, then own some 819,000 BTC, up 3.25% in the same period.

Analysis from Matthew Sigel,  the head of digital assets research at VanEck, underscores the growing institutional firepower aimed at bitcoin. He highlights that the combined capital-raising potential of companies such as Strategy (MSTR), Cantor Equity Partners (CEP), Asset Entities (ASST), Semler Scientific (SMLR), Kindly (NAKA), and Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) amounts to $76 billion. 

That amount represents 56% of the assets under management (AUM) of all bitcoin ETFs and 169% of the total net inflows into these ETFs over the past 16 months.

Here's another Illustration of institutional backing: BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) became the fastest fund to surpass $70 billion in AUM, achieving the milestone in just 341 days. That  eclipses the record held by SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which took 1,691 days, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. On Monday alone, IBIT saw $2.7 billion in trading volume, placing it sixth among all ETFs by daily volume. 

Still, institutions aren't the only influence. A recent Telegram note from QCP Capital pointed to one-year lows in implied volatility and a pattern of subdued price action, noting that BTC had been “stuck in a tight range” as mid-year approaches.

A clean break below $100,000 or above $110,000 is needed to “reawaken broader market interest,” it wrote.

Meantime, U.S. CPI, due Wednesday, and any news from the U.S.-China trade talks in London may help provide a stronger direction to the market. Stay alert!

There are signs that the crypto market bull run is about to begin, as Bitcoin's cup-and-handle pattern nears a breakout.

As crypto.news predicted, Bitcoin (BTC) could jump to at least $143,000 now that it has moved above the upper boundary of the cup-and-handle formation.

Bitcoin is also on the verge of breaking above the 8-year resistance trendline, a move that could ignite a broader crypto bull run. This article highlights the top altcoins to watch ahead of that potential breakout.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) is among the top altcoins to consider as the bull market gains traction. It has already surged 342% from its April low and is currently trading near its all-time high.

HYPE has rallied thanks to its growing dominance in the perpetual futures market. Data shows Hyperliquid processed over $245 billion in trading volume over the past 30 days. The protocol has also become one of the most profitable players in the decentralized exchange space, generating $65.5 million in revenue in May, up from $43.3 million in April.

The HYPE token is likely to continue climbing as its trading volume, revenue, and staking yield increase. It also invalidated a double-top pattern at $39.96, signaling further upside potential.

Uniswap (UNI) is another top altcoin to watch, driven by its expanding market share in decentralized finance. The protocol processed over $92.8 billion in volume over the past 30 days, generating $95 million in fees in May, up from $60 million the previous month.

Uniswap's Unichain network has emerged as one of the fastest-growing chains in the crypto ecosystem. Its DEX volume reached over $9.5 billion in the past 30 days, while its total value locked (TVL) in DeFi is nearing $1 billion. Unichain's stablecoin market cap has also surged to $320 million.

Technically, the UNI token has broken above the key resistance level at $7.5410, the high from May 11 and May 28, and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. A sustained move above this zone could open the door to the 50% retracement level at $11.97.

Ethereum (ETH) price is another token to buy as spot ETH ETF inflows jump. It has also formed a bullish flag pattern, comprising of a vertical line and a rectangle that resembles a hoisted flag. 

The upper limit of the flag is $2,743, and the lower limit is $1,386, creating a measured move of $1,357. Adding this to the breakout level at $2,740 gives a target of approximately $4,100.

Ethereum has also formed a golden cross pattern, where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average. This is a classic bullish signal that further supports the case for continued upside.

Team Ripple

Ripple is doubling down on blockchain innovation in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, committing over $5 million in additional funding through its global University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI). Spanning six countries—with renewed partnerships in South Korea, Japan, and Singapore, and new grants in Taiwan and Australia—this investment reflects Ripple's long-standing dedication to cultivating next-generation blockchain talent and supporting world class academic research.

With the highest concentration of neobanks globally and some of the largest and fastest-growing fintech markets, APAC is an epicenter of digital finance. Several markets have pioneered progressive regulatory frameworks, showing an appetite for experimentation and boasting thriving communities for builders, making this expansive region a leader in the adoption of digital assets and cutting-edge payment technologies.  

UBRI has been laying the groundwork for blockchain innovation in higher education for more than seven years. What began as an early bet on the power of academia has grown into a sustained, region-wide effort to equip the next generation of builders, researchers, and entrepreneurs. Across APAC, Ripple continues to work closely with top universities to support hands-on student initiatives, breakthrough research, and real-world experimentation—providing the tools, funding, and strategic guidance needed to turn ideas into impact. And with strong results already emerging, we're just getting started.

A renewed six-year, $1.1 million USD partnership with Korea University is emblematic of the deep ties formed by UBRI and serves as a foundation for Ripple to expand its relationships within South Korea and build on the partnership launched with Yonsei University last fall. Similarly, a renewed partnership with Kyoto University continues to advance blockchain research within Japan, where UBRI grants supporting Kyoto University and University of Tokyo now surpass $1.5 million.

In Singapore, UBRI is building upon its already strong network in the country with a grant to Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and a renewed commitment to the National University of Singapore (NUS), bringing its total funding in the region to over $3M. 

“Ripple's generous UBRI grant significantly enhances our research and development efforts and empowers us to pursue high-impact projects. With our current grant, we are developing an autonomous AI agent network on the XRP Ledger to create a transparent, modular, accessible, and collaborative AI platform harnessing blockchain technology. We believe this innovation will be pivotal in shaping the future of AI,” said Professor Yang Liu, College of Computing & Data Science at Nanyang Technological University. 

“Additionally, this support allows us to involve more students and researchers in the blockchain ecosystem by enabling them to build on the XRPL and contribute to its growth, thereby advancing our blockchain education initiatives.”

A prior grant to NUS-funded initiatives, like the FinTech Lab and the NUS Fintech Society, led to the creation of the first Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) at a university in Asia and tripled the number of NUS FinTech SG graduates in 2021. These milestones contributed to NUS being named the world's Top Blockchain University in 2021.  

UBRI is also expanding to Taiwan through a new partnership with the National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology (NKUST). Led by Dr. Echo Huang, Director of the International MBA Program, the initiative will explore the rapidly growing field of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Backed by a research fellowship and upcoming white paper, the project will examine the technical and policy implications of RWA issuance across networks, analyzing XRP Ledger's cross-chain functionality alongside blockchains Ethereum and Solana, as well as the role of on-/off-ramp providers in enabling institutional adoption. 

Kicking off with a six-figure grant and officially becoming UBRI's 60th partner (13th in APAC), NKUST will tap UBRI for support in launching an XRPL Student Builders Club along with its own XRPL validator to enable grassroots engagement with blockchain technology in Taiwan. This work builds on Taiwan's national momentum around asset tokenization, including recent initiatives led by the Financial Supervisory Commission and six major financial institutions.

“NKUST is excited about this new chapter, partnering with Ripple's University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI) to explore the potential of Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization on the XRP Ledger. We believe our work will be instrumental in demonstrating how this technology can unlock new value and opportunities—while also bringing cutting-edge innovation and helping empower Taiwan's next generation of builders and researchers,"" said Professor Echo Huang at National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology.

As part of its commitment to its university partners, UBRI supports groundbreaking research and pioneering projects by the world's leading experts in blockchain, cybersecurity, and information systems. UBRI has brought over $11M in funding into Asia to promote education, adoption, and innovation in the blockchain, crypto, and fintech spaces. 

UBRI-sponsored research projects led by Professors Ik Rae Jong and Dong Hoon Lee at Korea University are focused on a range of topics, including enhancing blockchain sharding efficiency, combining blockchain shards with Layer 2 solutions, and NFT privacy based on Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs). Their colleague Professor Junghee Lee is exploring both a dedicated device for crypto finance and a mixer that hides transaction records while still allowing investigators to audit them as necessary. 

At Hanyang University in South Korea, Professor Hyunok Oh leads a number of research projects, including one devoted to improving the efficiency and security of zk-SNARKs, which are crucial for enhancing blockchain privacy and scalability. 

In Australia, UBRI is deepening its commitment to blockchain education and research with a renewed partnership at the Australian National University (ANU) and a new collaboration with Victoria University—bringing the total investment in Australian universities to $1.3 million. 

At ANU, the renewed funding will support advanced legal coursework on blockchain, cryptocurrency, and digital payments, as well as faculty research centered around Evernode, a proposed Layer 2 smart contract platform for the XRPL. ANU will also continue operating its XRPL validator and publishing student research through the ANU Journal of Law and Technology.

Victoria University joins the UBRI network with a focus on developing blockchain curriculum and applied research initiatives. Together, these efforts help grow a strong pipeline of blockchain-literate professionals and strengthen UBRI's presence in the region.

Ripple's UBRI program is a key aspect of APAC's growing crypto and blockchain leadership, empowering universities to explore groundbreaking solutions that drive global blockchain adoption and interoperability. By nurturing partnerships, funding cutting-edge research, and fostering community engagement, Ripple is helping to shape financial systems in APAC and beyond.

“Asia-Pacific has long been a hub of fintech and blockchain innovation, and Ripple has been proud to invest in the region's academic talent from the very beginning,” said Eric van Miltenburg, Senior Vice President of Strategic Initiatives at Ripple. “Seven years into UBRI and with 60 university partners globally, we've seen firsthand the impact of long-term, trusted collaboration with these institutions. Strengthening existing partnerships—and welcoming new ones—reflects our continued commitment to supporting the talent and ideas shaping the future of blockchain on the XRP Ledger and at global scale.”

This year, Ripple is hosting its 7th annual UBRI Connect at XRP Ledger Apex, bringing together some of the world's leading blockchain researchers from 60 universities across 28 countries for a full day of panels, workshops, and academic exchange. The event kicks off with a Pre-Summit hosted at the National University of Singapore (NUS), reinforcing the region's central role in shaping blockchain education and research.

 Trump's CFTC nominee Brian Quintenz says blockchain will reshape industries beyond finance and calls for clear crypto rules to protect US leadership. 

Brian Quintenz, US President Donald Trump's nominee to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has said that blockchain is a foundational technology poised to transform much more than just finance.

In prepared remarks ahead of his Senate confirmation hearing shared with Cointelegraph, Quintenz pointed out the long-term impact of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. “I view blockchain as a horizontal technology that has the potential to touch every aspect of society,” he said.

Quintenz, who most recently served as the global head of policy at a16z Crypto (Andreessen Horowitz's digital asset arm), also mentioned the importance of a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto markets.

He said his global experience engaging with regulators and government officials has given him a clear view of what has and hasn't worked in crafting crypto regulatory frameworks, insights he plans to bring to US policymaking.

“As Congress considers new spot market regulatory authority over the crypto asset markets, I am fully prepared to provide the benefit of this experience to the members of this committee and to Congress as a whole,” he stated.

Quintenz didn't mince words on the dangers of weak oversight. He warned that allowing bad actors and fraudsters to operate unchecked would erode the United States' leadership in blockchain innovation.

He also emphasized the need for a comprehensive regulatory framework that clearly defines token classifications and assigns oversight responsibilities for crypto trading markets, arguing that such clarity is essential to protect users and foster continued innovation.

Beyond crypto, Quintenz pledged to maintain the CFTC's role as a global leader in market innovation and oversight. He pointed to his prior service as a CFTC Commissioner, where he was confirmed unanimously in 2017, and reiterated his commitment to risk-based regulation, domestic and international harmonization, and robust customer protection.

He reaffirmed his support for the CFTC's statutory mandate to promote responsible innovation. “The CEA's principles-based approach to regulation and self-certification framework has created a marketplace that continues to thrive with integrity,” he noted.

Quintenz's Senate hearing comes as lawmakers push to give the CFTC more power over crypto through the Clarity Act, which would create a “digital commodity” category and give the agency broad powers to regulate crypto.

However, concerns are growing over whether the agency has the leadership capacity to meet that challenge, as one commissioner seat remains unfilled and several others prepare to exit.

Last week, two of the remaining four CFTC commissioners, Republican Summer Mersinger and Democrat Goldsmith Romero, departed the commission. The remaining Republican Commissioner, Caroline Pham, has also stated that she will leave if and when Quintenz is sworn in.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","The NFT market is silently becoming infrastructure","https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-becoming-infrastructure","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 15:03:12 GMT","

 While headlines proclaim the NFT market's demise, NFTs are quietly shifting from speculative assets to essential digital infrastructure. NFTs are moving beyond speculation to underpin gaming, AI and Web3. 

Opinion by: Charu Sethi, president of Unique Network 

Some argue that NFTs are dead. Others are holding out for the speculative art boom to return with the next market cycle. Both assumptions miss the reality. NFTs are neither obsolete nor poised for another speculative hype wave. What's unfolding instead is likely the most important phase in their evolution: where NFTs are transitioning into core digital infrastructure underpinning gaming, AI and machine-driven applications.

There are clear signs that NFT utility is replacing speculation, and the trend is holding. According to DappRadar, in Q1 2025, NFT trading volume dropped 24%, but sales declined only by 10%, pointing to lower average prices rather than user exit. AI and social DApps — with the potential to leverage NFTs for agent identity, assets, credentials and access — grew sharply in Q1, and utility categories like real-world assets (RWAs), domain NFTs and metaverse assets showed sustained traction. 

In gaming, platforms like Mythical and The Sandbox continue to grow, where in-game assets provide real, functional value. While there is still a vision and demand for interoperable NFTs, there are also examples where they are being delivered for developers and end-users.

NFTs were originally conceived to enable verifiable digital ownership, identity and programmable rights — not speculative trading. It was meant to give people ownership of their digital lives. Be it their identity, health records, social media content or creative work — NFTs offered a way to prove ownership. That vision was foundational to the broader Web3 movement.

This foundational vision was obscured by the rise of memecoins and short-term financial hype, distorting public perception of NFTs and Web3. This core utility resurfaces as the agentic AI era emerges, where code meets cognition. Autonomous AI agents now require self-sovereign identity, memory and access control to operate effectively onchain.

With AI frameworks maturing, NFTs are becoming embedded as infrastructure. They function as identity anchors, verifiable data containers and access credentials for agents acting across decentralized environments. An NFT-bound agent can independently access services, sign transactions, and trigger contract logic — its authority validated by the NFT. This transforms NFTs into operational components that persist across contexts.

Recent: Crypto, NFTs are a lifeboat in the sinking fiat system: Finance Redefined

This utility is already in production. ReinforcedAI's subnet on Bittensor issues NFTs as proof of completed Solidity audits, enabling encrypted validator review and decentralized reward mechanisms. Similarly, NFTs are used to certify input-output processes across AI pipelines. In parallel, projects like Peaq use “machine NFTs” to give devices like vehicles and drones identity and autonomy to transact. As AI agents integrate further into Web3 systems, NFTs will underpin workflows ranging from personal AI wallets to non-fungible autonomous agents.

The growth of social wallets is another driver. Instead of complex key management, users onboard through email or social login, and their profile pics, memberships and credentials (silently NFTs) display as part of their Web3 identity. Over 50% of users aged 18-34 already use social wallets regularly, especially in gaming and community apps.

These wallets prioritize user experience and easily embed NFTs into familiar interfaces. In social gaming platforms, for example, players may not even realize their avatars, emotes or achievements are NFTs. Yet these assets are portable, tradable and interoperable — acting as the connective tissue across platforms. There are significant lessons learned about how true ownership and great UX are critical for SocialFi apps to succeed.

NFTs are not disappearing — they are becoming core infrastructure, functioning as the underlying layer for asset ownership, transactional logic and autonomous agent behavior in decentralized systems. They support player-owned economies in gaming, serve as identity and credential containers for AI agents, and enable payments and access rights in machine-to-machine networks. This reflects a broader architectural shift from front-end collectibles to back-end components embedded in wallets, SDKs and protocols. NFTs now power access control, data provenance and interoperability, redefining their role from visible assets to essential system primitives.

Waiting for the return of the speculative NFT boom as a measure of success is misguided — real progress is unfolding at the infrastructure layer, where NFTs are quietly becoming essential.

From June 16 to 22, 2025, Basel becomes home to the inaugural edition of Digital Art Mile— a new and ambitious initiative by ArtMeta that transforms the historic Rebgasse district into a vibrant epicenter for digital creativity. This week-long event runs in parallel with Art Basel and offers a curated alternative that addresses a conspicuous absence: digital art. Spread across Space25, the 4th Floor, and Kult.Kino Cinema, the fair gathers an international network of artists, curators, collectors, and technologists to explore how digital media reshapes the canon of contemporary art. With exhibitions, robotic installations, and conferences led by global voices in art and culture, Digital Art Mile invites both industry professionals and curious publics to rethink the boundaries of art in a digital age.

 

For first-time visitors, Digital Art Mile offers a paradigm shift. From interactive to historically rich displays, the fair seeks to challenge preconceptions. ArtMeta seeks to convince the skeptics that digital art isn't just about speculation and NFTs— it's about a rich, evolving art form rooted in dialogue and human imagination.

ArtMeta, co-founded by curator and digital art pioneer Georg Bak and digital entrepreneur Roger Haas, is carving out a distinct path for how digital art is experienced, understood, and collected. The platform originally emerged from their mutual desire to elevate digital art beyond novelty, rooting it instead within a broader historical and cultural narrative.

 

For its 2025 Basel edition, ArtMeta introduces the Digital Art Mile, conceived as a boutique fair with curated exhibitions and educational programming. Unlike conventional commercial events, its focus lies in thematic cohesion and historical dialogue, linking the legacy of early digital pioneers to the cutting edge of blockchain, AI, and Web3. Through its growing curatorial reach, ArtMeta positions itself as an anchor point in the evolving landscape of digital-native cultural production.

Digital Art Mile 2025 offers an immersive entry point into the pluralistic worlds of digital art, from generative image-making and robotics to blockchain-based collecting and AI-driven creativity. This edition's programming explores intersections between human expression and machine logic, between analog legacy and virtual futures. Beyond exhibitions, the fair includes a four-day conference series at Kult.Kino Cinema that brings together leading thinkers such as Christiane Paul (Whitney Museum), Ian Charles Stewart (Toledo Museum Labs), Sebastien Borget (The Sandbox), and Prof. Dr. Thomas Girst (BMW). Through these multi-perspective discussions, the fair aims not only to showcase the state of digital art but also to create frameworks for its institutional integration, economic viability, and cultural resonance.

A central highlight at Rebgasse 25 is the ‘Paintboxed' exhibition, a landmark collaboration between ArtMeta, Objkt, and the Tezos Foundation. It resurrects the Quantel Paintbox, a pioneering digital painting tool from the 1980s, celebrated for its pivotal role in transforming visual culture—from MTV graphics to the iconic posters of ‘Pulp Fiction' and ‘The Silence of the Lambs.' Paintboxed positions this forgotten chapter of digital history in conversation with the present.

 

Artists including Justin Aversano, Grant Yun, Ivona Tau, Hackatao, and Simon Denny were invited to create new works using one of the few remaining functional Paintboxes. Tau even collaborated with ChatGPT to receive step-by-step generative painting instructions, blurring the boundaries between human intuition and AI guidance. These new creations are displayed in lightboxes and paired with NFTs minted on the Tezos Foundation blockchain, allowing collectors to own dual manifestations of the same work—both analog and digital.

Located at Rebgasse 31, the 4th Floor reimagines a former warehouse as a future-forward gallery ecosystem, hosting some of the most experimental names in the space. Objkt.com presents ‘We Emotional Cyborgs: On Avatars and AI Agents,' curated by Anika Meier—a provocative exploration of virtual identity and post-human aesthetics. Robotic artworks take center stage in Bright Moments' ‘Automata,' which includes autonomous painting machines creating works in real-time. Historic pioneers such as Waldemar Cordeiro, Manfred Mohr, and Joan Truckenbrod are spotlighted by Mayor Gallery, RCM, and Galerie Charlot, positioning digital art within a longer, often overlooked lineage.

 

Other participants include The Sigg Art Foundation, Cypherdudes, LaCollection, and Sarasin Foundation, each offering unique vignettes into contemporary crypto culture. A lounge hosted by Tezos Foundation offers a space to engage with the underlying technology.

Digital Art Mile expands its cultural footprint with a robust conference series held at Kult.Kino Cinema on June 17 and 18. The talks tackle vital topics such as the role of digital art in museums, the evolution of AI-generated creativity, and how corporations are adopting NFTs and digital aesthetics into their branding and storytelling. Notable sessions include ‘Digital Art in Museums' featuring Christiane Paul and Ian Charles Stewart, and ‘Digital Art in Corporations,' moderated by designboom, with insights from BMW's Prof. Dr. Thomas Girst and Sandbox's Sebastien Borget. According to Bak, these sessions aim to close the gap between the institutional canonization of digital art and the vibrant discourse happening on social media. A particular point of interest is the integration of crypto culture in legacy institutions and how corporate players like UBS, Arab Bank, and luxury brands are shaping their own digital art narratives.

 

By building a space where curated exhibitions meet educational discourse, the fair aspires to become the leading marketplace and forum for digital art worldwide. Looking ahead, ArtMeta plans to expand its editorial output and continue fostering deeper conversations across cities and continents.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","How Experience NFTs Unlock Exclusive Events","https://blockchainmagazine.net/how-experience-nfts-unlock-exclusive-events/","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 10:48:07 GMT","

Experience NFTs are transforming how we access exclusive events, from sold-out concerts to immersive metaverse festivals. Far beyond digital collectibles, these blockchain-based tokens act as secure, verifiable keys to real-world and virtual experiences. Platforms like OneExperience are leading the charge, blending tokenized event access with community-driven perks.

Experience NFTs are non-fungible tokens that grant access to unique events. Think VIP concert passes, luxury travel packages, sports game perks, or virtual reality festivals. Unlike traditional tickets, these NFTs, stored on blockchains like Ethereum or Polygon, offer immutable ownership, exclusive benefits, and resale potential. OneExperience, for example, focuses on “phygital” events, merging physical and digital access. Their platform streamlines NFT purchases via user-friendly interfaces, making NFT event tickets accessible even to crypto newcomers. Other platforms, like those powering Coachella's NFT passes, show the versatility of this model across industries.

At their core, Experience NFTs rely on blockchain's security and transparency. Smart contracts define what each NFT unlocks, such as early entry, digital collectibles, or artist meet-and-greets. For instance, a smart contract might restrict access to 100 VIP passes, ensuring exclusivity. Blockchains like Polygon offer low-cost, eco-friendly transactions, while Ethereum provides robust security for high-value events. Key advantages include:

This tech outpaces traditional ticketing, eliminating scalping and enhancing fan engagement.

Experience NFTs are already powering real-world and digital events. OneExperience, a Web3 innovator, tokenized VIP passes for a 2024 music festival, partnering with a global artist and a top venue. Holders accessed backstage areas, received limited-edition digital art, and joined a virtual afterparty. Coachella's 2022 NFT tickets offered lifetime festival access, selling out in hours and sparking buzz on marketplaces. In sports, the NBA's Top Shot platform has experimented with NFT-based game perks, like courtside upgrades. A luxury travel NFT for a metaverse-inspired resort, included AR-guided tours and exclusive dinners, blending physical and digital experiences.

Experience NFTs are driving Web3's shift toward utility and community. Beyond events, they're used in gaming (e.g., metaverse concerts) and art (e.g., tokenized gallery openings). Brands like Adidas and LVMH's Aura Blockchain Consortium are adopting similar models for loyalty programs, proving tokenized event access has broad appeal. OneExperience stands out with its intuitive platform and partnerships with artists and venues, fostering fan communities through on-chain rewards. This “phygital” trend (merging physical and digital engagement) signals a new era where NFTs deliver tangible, memorable value.

Despite their potential, Experience NFTs face obstacles. Crypto wallet setup can intimidate mainstream users, though OneExperience's user-friendly onboarding helps. Blockchain scalability is another hurdle – Ethereum's high gas fees can spike during demand surges, but Polygon and Tezos offer cost-effective alternatives. Traditional ticketing giants like Live Nation may resist disruption, and regulators could target NFT ticketing for compliance issues, such as anti-money laundering rules. Environmental concerns linger, but platforms using eco-friendly blockchains like Polygon mitigate criticism, aligning with sustainability trends.

Experience NFTs are bridging the real and digital worlds, turning your wallet into a VIP pass. From OneExperience's music festival NFTs to Coachella's lifetime tickets and sports perks, these tokens are redefining fandom. They offer security, exclusivity, and community in ways traditional tickets can't match. Whether you're a crypto enthusiast or just love unique experiences, tokenized event access is worth exploring. Check out platforms like OneExperience to unlock your next adventure—because the future of events is already here.

First Force is set to launch a new Telegram token collection inspired by the TAC community on June 17, marking one of the largest drops on the TON ecosystem.

According to a press release sent to crypto.news, the First Force token collection consists of 10,000 unique Soulbound Tokens or SBTs inspired by the TAC community. TAC is a blockchain designed for EVM dApps to access the TON (TON) and Telegram ecosystem user base. 

Each NFT is valued at 30 TON each or approximately $100 according to current market prices. At press time, TON has gone up by more than 4% in the past 24 hours of trading. The token has managed to reach a value of around $3.29. 

Each token is permanently bound to the holder's wallet and cannot be transferred or sold to other entities. This reflects the SBT concept of anchoring one's digital identity on-chain. Therefore, the project employs a limit of one mint per wallet across the board. 

By holding a unique SBT, holders are granted access to future community-driven experiences and opportunities.

Whitelist registrations for the SBT collection opens on June 10, with the first phase starting on June 17, where 2,000 mint slots will be distributed. On the other hand, the second phase will proceed on a first-come, first-served basis. Traders will be able to mint the TAC-inspired token on TON's NFT marketplace, Getgems, where 8,000 SBTs will be made available through a public watchlist.

The artwork features TACMAN, a robot-like identity used widely by the TAC community.

TAC was built with the aim of making it easier for builders to deploy Ethereum dApps on the TON blockchain. Therefore, First Force dedicates its new collection to builders and early supporters of the protocol whose efforts have helped to “bring Ethereum (ETH)'s open innovation to the heart of Telegram.”

Last April, TAC announced a collaboration with Agglayer to launch a networking event that took place in Topgolf Dubai on April 30. The event brought together industry leaders from both the EVM space and TON ecosystems.

Plasma's highly anticipated ICO (Initial Coin Offering) for its XPL token closed its vaults after raising $500 million from over 1,100 depositors.

The event, which marked a dizzying display of capital deployment and gas wars, has raised concerns among community members.

While the token has not yet been launched, expectations are already swelling that the final unlock could bring in $1 billion to $2 billion, if not more.

“We have reached our deposit cap of $500 million. We are thrilled that 1,100+ wallets participated, with a median deposit amount of ~$35,000. Trillions,” Plasma announced.

Amid the headlines and hype, however, a deeper story is emerging. Concerns extend from whale domination and insider access to a growing sense that token launches are increasingly becoming gated events for the crypto elite.

The numbers show that only a handful of wallets accounted for outsized allocations. More specifically, the top three contributors alone deployed over $100 million collectively.

Perhaps more shocking, one user reportedly paid 39 ETH (approximately $104,871 at current rates of $2,689) in gas fees, which secured them a $10 million USDC allocation.

“This guy spent 100k in gas (230,000 Gwei) to get his deposit in for Plasma,” wrote MonaMoon, the founder of the Duck Frens NFT project.

This illustrates the intensity of FOMO and the lengths participants were willing to go to for early access. Notwithstanding, the frenzy has come at a reputational cost. With whales taking the lion's share, many are calling this launch anything but fair.

“…it's an obvious skip for the community…Only 100 wallets with $50 million each… these wallets alone will create an oversubscription of 100x… unfortunately, it's not a fair launch, even though the price is very attractive,” warned an X user  before the raise closed.

Despite offering just 10% of the total XPL token supply in the public sale at a $500 million FDV (fully diluted valuation), retail users were effectively pushed to the sidelines. They will likely only get in later, at 10x to 16x the price.

This sharp disparity has some dubbing it a “whale sale,” rather than a launch accessible to the broader community. Further, there may be more than just bad optics at play. Crypto trader Hanzo raised serious red flags, suggesting possible coordinated insider behavior.

Money laundering or just a huge insider play?Plasma's ICO got filled in 2 minutes:• 100 wallets• $48M funded• source Coinbase PremiumMust-read TRUTH even if you didn't hear about Plasma before 🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/fxTOcbrXy1

Hanzo calls out over 100 wallets, each receiving 48 million USDC, before the token even launched, highlighting that some of these wallets approved token interactions before the token contract went public.

“That means insiders had early access to mint and trade. This wasn't a surprise launch — it was a private party. Retail wasn't invited,” he claimed.

The mechanics of the raise also raise questions. Hosted on Sonar/Echo, dubbed by some as “the CoinList of this cycle,” a time-weighted share of vault deposits determined plasma's deposit period.

Participants had to lock stablecoins on Ethereum, with a minimum 40-day lockup. However, with the deposit cap abruptly raised to $500 million and filled almost instantly, many users were left wondering whether this was ever meant to be an open opportunity.

Even the technology underpinning Plasma has not escaped scrutiny. A user broke down the chain's architecture and found it lacking.

“Plasma is another L1 chain… It uses a ‘classic' pBFT consensus layer, with Proof-of-Stake… and Bitcoin as ‘settlement' by simply publishing state differences… It looks a lot like many alt-L1 EVM forks… It surfs on the Bitcoin “side-chain” marketing campaign and is pushed by influencors.. but I am not convinced at all,” the user noted.

In his view, Plasma's use of influencers and Bitcoin branding is more marketing veneer than technical substance.

What makes this worse is how well it's working.Influencers are hyping it. Retail is showing up.The liquidity is flowing — right where it needs to.Everything is going according to plan.

Still, not everyone agrees. Zaheer from SplitCapital praised the distribution, noting a broad holder distribution with over 1,100 wallets and only one wallet holding $50 million.

“All things considered insanely good distribution of holders for Plasma at $500m total size of deposit. Seeing a ton of folks with smaller amounts on here and only one entity with $50m in a wallet. Well done,” he stated in a post.

According to Zaheer, this contrasts with the typical whale-dominated ICOs and suggests a more inclusive allocation strategy.

Plasma's ICO serves as a mirror to today's market mechanics, where speed, size, and for some, connections, often matter more than innovation or accessibility.

Whether Plasma becomes a foundational chain or another cautionary tale will depend on the unlock numbers and how its ecosystem fairs beyond the ICO hype.

The ICO boom of 2017–2018 was a digital gold rush. Promises of decentralized revolutions drew in billions from eager investors, yet many dreams ended in disaster. Some of the most well-funded projects failed spectacularly, due to scams, legal issues, or poor execution. These weren't just minor missteps; they burned through hundreds of millions of dollars and shattered investor trust across the crypto world.

In 2017 and 2018, launching an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) was as trendy as launching a startup in Silicon Valley. Using Ethereum's ERC-20 standard, projects could easily mint tokens, slap on a whitepaper, and raise millions, sometimes in minutes. Investors, driven by hype and the fear of missing out, poured over $20 billion into ICOs during this period.

But behind the buzz were serious structural flaws:

The ICO era saw billions raised on bold promises, many of which collapsed spectacularly. This ranked list spotlights the 10 most expensive ICO failures based on how much they raised before falling apart due to scams, legal issues, or mismanagement.

AriseBank claimed to be the world's first decentralized bank but operated without regulatory approval. The SEC froze its assets, and the project was shut down shortly after launch.

LoopX promised automated crypto trading powered by AI but disappeared overnight after collecting millions. It became one of the most blatant and fastest exit scams of the ICO era.

Plexcoin lured investors with promises of 1,354% returns in under a month—an obvious red flag. The SEC quickly halted operations and charged the founder with fraud.

Backed by celebrities like Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khaled, Centra Tech promised a crypto debit card backed by Visa. The founders were arrested, and the token collapsed to zero.

COMSA, launched by Tech Bureau, aimed to streamline blockchain adoption in Japan. But after its parent exchange, Zaif was hacked, trust evaporated, and the project lost momentum.

Envion promoted mobile crypto mining units and raised big, but quickly fell into legal disputes between the founders and investors. Swiss regulators eventually ordered the company's liquidation.

The DAO was one of Ethereum's first major projects, but a critical code flaw led to a $60 million hack. It resulted in a controversial Ethereum hard fork and permanently ended the project.

Tezos raised massive funds but was paralyzed by internal legal conflicts between its founders and the foundation. Although it eventually launched, the delays and lawsuits damaged its reputation.

Dragon Coin targeted the Asian gambling market and was allegedly linked to criminal syndicates. Despite its huge rise, it failed to deliver and left investors with near-worthless tokens.

TON was one of the most ambitious ICOs ever, launched by Telegram to create a decentralized internet. The SEC blocked its release, citing unregistered securities, and Telegram refunded what it could before canceling the project.

These cases add more weight to the total multi-billion-dollar loss from the ICO era. Each one highlights different failure points, from outright fraud to mismanagement and security flaws.

While each failure had its own story, many shared common red flags, like unrealistic promises, lack of a working product, and regulatory blind spots. Understanding these warning signs can help investors avoid repeating the costly mistakes of the past.

These patterns taught the crypto community a hard lesson: if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.

Some failed ICOs disappeared without a trace, while others morphed into functioning, though diminished, projects. This section explores how the landscape evolved post-crisis, with new funding models and lessons that shaped the Web3 space.

Most others, like Dragon Coin, Envion, and COMSA, saw their tokens delisted and their communities dissolved.

The ICO bust forced the crypto industry to mature, driving better practices, smarter investors, and tougher regulations. But with new trends constantly emerging, the question remains: Has the space truly learned, or is history set to repeat itself?

But new fundraising formats like memecoin pre-sales, NFT-based raises, and DAO treasuries suggest that risk still lives on. The line between innovation and exploitation remains thin.

The most expensive ICO failures serve as a hard-earned education for the crypto space. They revealed what happens when greed outpaces governance, and how quickly billions can evaporate in the absence of structure. These stories are more than historic footnotes, they're reminders that in the Web3 world, transparency, trust, and accountability are the only true currencies of lasting value.

Crypto World News

June 10, 2025 by Sheila 

Hong Kong's initiative for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) has progressed with the introduction of a cross-border pilot project. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is collaborating with Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to evaluate secure transactions between the digital Hong Kong dollar (e-HKD) and a stablecoin pegged to the Australian dollar. 

This study, part of the e-HKD+ Pilot Program, unites international financial leaders such as Visa, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), ChinaAMC, and Fidelity International.  With the CCIP the e-HKD pilot utilises Chainlink to facilitate transactions across permissioned and public blockchains. 

The project illustrates how an Australian investor can use a stablecoin pegged to the Australian dollar to purchase an asset tokenized in Hong Kong, with the final assets denominated in e-HKD. Visa's report on the study confirms that the pilot explores the settlement process for these cross-border transactions making use of both the private DASchain and the public Ethereum Sepolia testnet.

The pilot demonstrates Chainlink's ability to connect different blockchain environments, allowing instant and secure settlement. In the test, the protocol allowed simultaneous transfer, known as atomic settlement, between ANZ's A$DC stablecoin and Hong Kong's e-HKD. This method lowers the risk of either party failing to deliver, which is a key concern in international payments.

The study assessed two common token standards: ERC-20 for the e-HKD and ERC-3643 for tokenized deposits. These features include those to support regulatory requirements, like identity verification, which is included in the latter. These elements aim to ensure that cross-border digital asset transfer is conducted securely and transparently.

Chainlink's CCIP delivered the messaging framework for the pilot, enabling data and value transfers across blockchains without conventional asset bridging. This innovation solves the challenges that financial institutions have in optimizing the movement of assets between private, controlled networks and public blockchain environments.

The HKMA began the second phase of its CBDC pilot in September 2024. Eleven corporate groups are exploring different use cases for the e-HKD, with final findings expected by late 2025. The project's backers say tokenized real-world assets and stablecoins could boost global liquidity and transparency. Visa and industry analysts believe tokenized assets could reach a $10 trillion market size by 2030, while stablecoins may see a $3.7 trillion market by then.

These advancements also provided operational benefits and new opportunities, according to Emma Pecenicic of Fidelity International. According to Richard Schroder from ANZ, the pilot is designed to make cross-chain transfers seamless.

Additionally, Chainlink's decentralized oracle network, which secures over $21 trillion in transaction value across more than 50 blockchains, remains a critical component of this cross-border digital asset exchange.

Yesterday on the official Chainlink X profile it was announced a successfully conducted test thanks to which secure exchanges of the new Hong Kong CBDC with an Australian dollar stablecoin were carried out.

The test was part of an ongoing use case within Phase 2 of the e-HKD+ pilot program.

Chainlink has made its technical platform available, but Visa, ANZ, China AMC, and Fidelity International also participated in the test.

Summary

The test was described by Visa within a lengthy public report, and it took place within the e-HKD pilot program, the new CBDC of Hong Kong. 

During the initial phase of this program, some pioneering companies, including Visa, have explored the use cases of the e-HKD. 

In particular, the HKMA has identified three key areas where the e-HKD could add value, namely programmability, tokenization, and near real-time simultaneous settlement of transactions.

In September of last year, the project was renamed e-HKD+ because Phase 2 of the pilot program was launched, which also opened up to tokenized assets. 

In addition to Visa, the project also includes Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), Fidelity International (FIL), and ChinaAMC Hong Kong (China AMC). 

The tested use case aimed to explore cross-border transactions between new forms of digital currency and a tokenized money market fund (MMF). The participants in the pilot project will test how investors based in Australia can purchase tokenized fund shares from asset managers in Hong Kong using e-HKD or tokenized deposits. 

e-HKD is the new CBDC of Hong Kong. 

Hong Kong is part of China in every respect, but it is also an autonomous territory with its own currency, the Hong Kong dollar (HKD). 

In October 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched a pilot project to explore the potential of a natively digital version of its currency. 

Since then, many tests have been conducted on this natively digital version of HKD, called precisely e-HKD, but it has not yet been launched on the markets. It is therefore still only a prototype in the testing phase. 

e-HKD will therefore be in all respects a CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency), that is, a natively digital currency issued by a central bank. The same HKMA is also the central bank of the Chinese autonomous territory of Hong Kong. 

China, in turn, already has its own CBDC, called the digital yuan. 

It was launched several years ago, but it did not achieve great success. 

However, if citizens are not very fond of using these natively digital central bank coins, which are absolutely not anonymous and completely controlled by the central banks themselves, the discussion obviously changes a lot when it comes to institutions. 

In fact, for those who move large amounts of money at an institutional level, it is very convenient to be able to rely on a solid, secure, and above all certain infrastructure. 

It is not a coincidence that the test conducted in Hong Kong thanks to Chainlink involved a tokenized money market fund and asset managers. 

The CDBC will most likely continue to be unpopular among private citizens, but they could instead achieve great success within institutional finance. 

Stablecoins, on the other hand, are a different thing. 

First of all, they are pseudo-anonymous, even though all transactions are public. 

Furthermore, they are not managed by a central bank, but by a computer protocol. In the case of networks like Ethereum, it is in fact inviolable and above all unmodifiable, as well as uncensorable.

The stablecoin used for the test with Hong Kong's CBDC is A$DC, a token collateralized in Australian dollars right on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Thanks to Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), ANZ's private blockchain (DASchain) has been connected to a public Ethereum testnet (Sepolia) to conduct the exchange test. 

In this way, it was possible to carry out an “atomic” (i.e., simultaneous) settlement of the stablecoin 

in e-HKD, without the use of intermediaries, while at the same time reducing counterparty risk by ensuring that both sides of the transaction were settled almost instantly.

Regarding the e-HKD, the classic Ethereum ERC-20 standard was used.

The token of Chainlink, LINK, was not involved in the test. 

It was carried out on the Ethereum blockchain, although not on the mainnet but on a testnet, and the role of Chainlink was to provide its infrastructure. 

In this way, it was possible to carry out the on-chain exchange between A$DC and e-HKD. These were the only two tokens directly involved in the transaction, plus the fees paid in ETH. 

From a strictly technical point of view, the procedure was as follows. 

First, some Australian investors deposited Australian dollars (AUD) and received the corresponding A$DC tokens on the private blockchain.

At that point, a module of ANZ purchased e-HKD directly from HKMA.

HKMA recorded the transaction and sent the e-HKD tokens to ANZ.

At that point, ANZ minted wrapped e-HKD tokens and transferred them to investors in exchange for their A$DC. It is precisely at this stage that Chainlink's CCIP was used.

Chainlink LINK/USD is experiencing a strong rally, trading above $14 and gaining around 7% in the last 24 hours. The rise follows a successful trial program in which Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) enabled a record cross-border transaction between an Australian dollar stablecoin and Hong Kong's central bank digital currency (CBDC).

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) e-HKD+ Pilot Programme has reached a major milestone. Chainlink's CCIP has successfully enabled the first real-world simulation of programmable money for cross-border investment in tokenized assets. The trial, which was done with Visa, ANZ, ChinaAMC, and Fidelity International, linked ANZ's private blockchain DASChain to Ethereum's public testnet.

In the test, an Australian investor used a AUD-backed stablecoin (A$DC) to buy a tokenized money market fund with Hong Kong's digital currency (e-HKD). It usually takes two to three days for a transaction to settle, but it happened almost instantly, showing that blockchain might get rid of middlemen and lower the risks of cross-border transactions.

With CCIP now live on dozens of blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana Virtual Machine-compatible networks, this achievement makes Chainlink a key infrastructure supplier in the changing world of digital banking.


LINK/USD


 

From a technical point of view, LINK's price action exhibits strong momentum signs that point to more rises. The coin has made a great comeback from its crucial support level of $12.59, rising 11.40% and staying that way through Tuesday's trading session.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 49 and is moving up toward the neutral 50 level. This means that negative momentum is receding. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is very close to a bullish crossover on the daily chart, which is more crucial. This would be a strong buying signal and confirm the rising trend.

Volume analysis shows that there is a lot of purchasing demand, with more than 1 million LINK exchanged during the breakout session at 10:00 UTC. This confirms that both institutions and individuals are positive.

Coinglass data shows that LINK's long-to-short ratio has reached 1.25, the highest level in more than a month. This supports the technical view. This ratio is above 1.0, which means that traders are quite bullish on the market. More traders are betting on prices going up than down.

The way futures are set up matches the way fundamentals are changing. Traders seem to be setting up for more upside because Chainlink's real-world use in financial infrastructure is growing.

If the current bullish trend keeps up, LINK might reach its May 29 high of $16.19, which is about 11% higher than where it is now. If this resistance level is broken, it might lead to the weekly resistance level at $18.81, which could mean gains of about 30%.

Traders should keep an eye on the $12.59 support level, because any drop below this level could mean that bearish sentiment is coming back. The current trading range of $13.80 to $13.95 is a good place for prices to keep going up.

The present technical breakout is supported by the fact that tokenized asset markets are expected to be worth more than $2 trillion by 2030 and Chainlink is positioning itself as an important part of cross-border digital finance. The successful Hong Kong CBDC trial is simply the first step in Chainlink's integration into existing traditional financial (TradFi) systems. This might lead to a steady demand for LINK tokens as the network's utility grows around the world.","{'href': 'https://www.fxleaders.com', 'title': 'FXLeaders'}","cryptocurrency"

Legislation to regulate dollar-linked tokens would tie digital assets into the broader financial system. That's a big deal, say boosters and critics alike

Stablecoins had once seemed like yesterday's news. Now they're a Washington obsession.

Stablecoins are a special flavor of cryptocurrency. Unlike Bitcoin or countless wildly traded memecoins, whose values rise and fall based on market moods, the most popular versions of these digital tokens are supposed to always be worth $1 each. They greased the wheels of the ­pandemic-era crypto boom by giving traders a digital substitute for cash. Advocates touted them as the future of money. After the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange in 2022, however, they fell off many people's radar, along with the rest of crypto.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","cryptocurrency"

Societe Generale-FORGE announced plans to launch a USD denominated stablecoin on permissionless blockchain networks, partnering with Bank of New York Mellon (BNY) as reserve custodian. The USD CoinVertible (USDCV) will be deployed on both Ethereum and Solana blockchains, offering institutional grade digital currency access around the clock.

The new stablecoin represents SG-FORGE's second digital currency offering, following the EUR CoinVertible (EURCV) launched in April 2023. As the first subsidiary of a global systemically important bank to launch a public blockchain stablecoin, SG-FORGE aims to capitalize on the growing institutional adoption of digital assets.

“The stablecoin market remains largely US Dollar denominated. This new currency will enable our clients, either institutions, corporates or retail investors, to leverage the benefits of an institutional-grade stablecoin,” said Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of Societe Generale – FORGE.

BNY also provides bank accounts for Circle's USDC stablecoin as well as custody and other services for the BlackRock operated Circle Reserve Fund.

Trading of USDCV is expected to begin in early July, though the stablecoin will not be available to US clients due to regulatory restrictions. Both USD and EUR versions comply with Europe's Markets in Crypto-assets regulation (MiCAR), with SG-FORGE licensed as an Electronic Money Institution by French authorities.

EURCV currently operates only on Ethereum, but the company previously announced plans to expand to multiple blockchains, including Stellar, Solana, and XRP Ledger. The EUR stablecoin maintains a modest €41 million market capitalization, with distribution concentrated among few holders. Four wallets control over 90% of supply, and three representing €25 million has remained largely inactive.

SG-FORGE positions both stablecoins to serve a diverse client base spanning institutional investors, corporations and retail users. The stablecoins will be listed on crypto exchanges and made available through various brokers and payment service providers, targeting broad market appeal beyond traditional finance applications.

PARIS, June 10 (Reuters) - France's Societe Generale (SOGN.PA), said on Tuesday it plans to launch a publicly tradable, dollar-backed stablecoin through its digital asset subsidiary, making it the first major bank to enter the growing market of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies.

The new digital currency, named ""USD CoinVertible"", will be issued on both the Ethereum and Solana blockchains, with public trading expected to start in July, SocGen's crypto arm SG-FORGE said in a statement.Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to a traditional currency, usually the dollar, allowing people to move large sums of money using blockchain networks instead of traditional banking payment systems.

The sector has seen rapid growth, driven by crypto company Tether, which has issued $155 billion of its dollar-pegged tokens.SG-FORGE launched a euro-based stablecoin in 2023, although it has not been widely adopted, with just 41.8 million euros ($47.62 million) in circulation, according to its website.

SocGen said its stablecoins are classed as e-money tokens and will be regulated under MiCA, the European Union's landmark crypto regulation adopted in 2023.

Tether does not have a licence to operate in the European Union under MiCA.

Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SG-FORGE, said that there was demand for a regulated dollar-based stablecoin.

""At the moment, there are no other banking-related players in that space ... that's definitely the feedback we have from the market, both corporates, financial institutions, but also crypto exchanges,"" he said. ""There is a very, very strong need for well-regulated, robust offering in the crypto and stablecoin space"".

Stablecoin issuers typically take in dollars from customers and give them the crypto token in return. The issuers profit by investing these dollar holdings into yield-bearing assets such as bonds.

BNY will serve as the custodian for SG-FORGE's reserves, which will initially be kept in a cash account, before later being invested into other assets, Stenger said.

SG-FORGE said that its token can be used for crypto trading, cross-border payments, foreign exchange transactions and management of collateral and cash, and will be listed on various crypto exchanges, without giving further details.

The subsidiary has ""more than 15"" crypto exchanges and brokers being onboarded as clients, Stenger added.

In the U.S., Congress is poised to pass legislation to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Bank of America could launch a stablecoin, its CEO said earlier this year, and some other large banks are considering issuing a joint stablecoin.

Tether is the world's largest stablecoin issuer. Its CEO said in a post on X that the company was the seventh biggest buyer of U.S. government debt in 2024, because it holds its dollar reserves in Treasuries.

The second-largest issuer, Circle, went public on the U.S. stock market on June 5 and saw its shares soar 48% on Friday.

Regulators have long warned that stablecoins could impact market stability by creating connections between mainstream finance and more volatile crypto markets.

His business dealings and policy agenda are now in perfect alignment.

The world of crypto can feel impenetrable. The basic technology is complicated enough, but the subculture—with its own particular argot and decorum—is what's truly forbidding. Even if you're not quite ready to figure out what DePIN or zk-SNARKs are, you can get a solid glimpse into the industry right now just by looking at the lineup of the 2025 Bitcoin Conference, held late last month in Las Vegas. Speakers included goofball meme-coin boosters, good-hearted cypherpunks, crypto podcasters with names such as “Gwart,” and an army of Wall Street execs who seem to have waited until bitcoin hit $100,000 to give the whole crypto thing a shot.



There were also a whole lot of MAGA acolytes. Vice President J. D. Vance, the eldest Trump sons, and the White House crypto czar David Sacks all gave speeches that coalesced around a unifying theme: Trump and crypto are meant for each other. “What's going on here in this very room, at this very conference, that's the financial side of everything we've been fighting for on the free-speech side,” Don Jr. said during a conversation with the CEO of Rumble, a social-media platform favored by right-wing users. “They're inextricably linked.”



In other words, the message was that Trump cares deeply about the kinds of civil-libertarian ideas that the bitcoin world has long touted. It's a convenient narrative, a lofty way of explaining this once very bitcoin-skeptical president's sudden embrace of crypto. At least, it's one that transcends sheer self-enrichment: In the past year, members of the Trump family have launched two meme coins and announced a majority stake in a new crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. As I've previously written, crypto is quickly becoming the Trump family business: Last month, the president hosted the biggest investors in his $TRUMP coin for a private dinner at his golf course outside Washington, D.C.



But the linkages between Trump and crypto run deeper than just a couple of business investments. His White House has also ushered in a starkly pro-crypto agenda—rolling back regulations and dropping lawsuits to punish alleged crypto wrongdoing. The same week that Don Jr. spoke at the Bitcoin Conference, the Department of Labor eased a Biden-era guidance that made it difficult for Americans to invest their 401(k) plans in crypto because digital currencies can be volatile and prone to hacks. In cutting this language, regulators are taking away a guardrail, encouraging more investment in crypto. This, in turn, could boost the price of bitcoin and other coins, which is a boon to Trump's own enterprises. It always comes back to the president himself: Trump's crypto ambitions are as much about public policy as they are about his own meme coins.



Crypto has become the glue that binds together so much of what the president and his administration are doing. Consider Trump Media & Technology Group, best-known as the parent company of his social-media app, Truth Social. Trump Media didn't start as a crypto business, but now it's pivoting to crypto. Late last month, Trump Media announced that it would raise money to purchase $2.5 billion in bitcoin, effectively creating a corporate bitcoin reserve. Why? “We view bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom,” Devin Nunes, the CEO of Trump Media and a former Republican congressman, said in a statement. Putting the pseudo-utopian language aside, such a bitcoin reserve mostly just serves to tie the price of Trump Media's stock, $DJT, to the price of bitcoin writ large. A multibillion-dollar investment is unreservedly good for crypto, but it's also good for the Trump family, because much of the president's own net worth is now tied up in crypto assets. (Neither the White House nor the Trump Media & Technology Group responded to my requests for comment.)



Perhaps the idea of a bitcoin reserve sounds familiar. It explicitly mirrors the White House's announcement of a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” in March, as part of a broader effort to make the U.S. a global leader in crypto. Both serve the same function: Such large-scale institutional investment in crypto—whether from the government or a company—further legitimizes these digital currencies, ensuring their long-term viability as an asset class. Trump's campaign to promote crypto and juice the price of these coins is in essence two-pronged: Once the White House sets its agenda, the Trump family's private-sector business can back it.



Trump was all about pro-crypto policy even before he began launching his raft of crypto businesses. His campaign promise to fire Biden's top crypto cop, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, helped pull in donations from industry heavyweights. Especially after the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried, Gensler was focused on prosecuting individual crypto companies—a policy now derisively referred to as “Operation Choke Point 2.0” (a nod to the Obama-era initiative that put pressure on banks to stop working with payday lenders, pawn shops, and certain other businesses). During his keynote speech at the Bitcoin Conference, Vance put it bluntly: “Operation Choke Point 2.0 is dead, and it's not coming back under the Trump administration.”



Indeed, the administration has dropped more than a dozen lawsuits and investigations against crypto firms. And as Trump's second term has gone on, the distinctions between what's pro-Trump and what's pro-crypto have blurred together, approaching something like a singularity. In MAGA cosmology, crypto, Trump, and America now exist in perfect alignment—what's good for one is good for the others. While Trump talks about bringing back manufacturing jobs to the U.S., the Trump sons are running a crypto-mining company called American Bitcoin and Trump Media is throwing its weight behind “Made in America” crypto investment funds. After firing many of the top regulators responsible for keeping crypto in check, Trump has cleared the way for major cash injections throughout the crypto industry—including, of course, in his own businesses. The pretense for the regulatory rollbacks and Trump's personal crypto investments is the same: It benefits America.



The irony is that cryptocurrencies were supposed to be a form of protection against exactly this sort of connection to the state. Bitcoin was invented as a way to privately transfer money online, with the ambitious goal of creating a new financial order outside the purview of the international monetary regime, uncontrolled by any government. (After all, the technical basis for crypto is known as “decentralization.”) In loosening crypto restrictions that benefit the industry (and Trump himself), Trump is manifesting the old crypto dream of a new financial order. But far from being faceless and decentralized, the very concept of crypto is starting to reflect the image of just one man.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","cryptocurrency"

Legislation to regulate dollar-linked tokens would tie digital assets into the broader financial system. That's a big deal, say boosters and critics alike

Stablecoins had once seemed like yesterday's news. Now they're a Washington obsession.

Stablecoins are a special flavor of cryptocurrency. Unlike Bitcoin or countless wildly traded memecoins, whose values rise and fall based on market moods, the most popular versions of these digital tokens are supposed to always be worth $1 each. They greased the wheels of the ­pandemic-era crypto boom by giving traders a digital substitute for cash. Advocates touted them as the future of money. After the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange in 2022, however, they fell off many people's radar, along with the rest of crypto.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","cryptocurrency"

FILE - Donald Trump speaks at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference July 27, 2024, in Nashville, Tenn.

It's one of crypto's hottest trends: publicly traded companies buying bitcoin and then buying even more.

President Donald Trump's media company just announced a plan to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, joining a growing number of so-called “bitcoin treasury companies” as the world's most popular cryptocurrency hits all-time highs.

The companies buy bitcoin for different reasons: Some hold it as a hedge against inflation or to signal support for the cryptocurrency industry, while some firms have made using debt and stock sales to buy bitcoin their primary business strategy.

“The world at large has no idea what's happening and they're in for a big shock,” Dylan LeClair, an executive at the Japan-based Metaplanet, which recently went from being a budget hotel firm to a bitcoin treasury company, said at a recent crypto conference. “This is a one-way train, nothing is going to stop this.”

The massive increases in some firms' stock price may seem to validate LeClair's bravado, but there are plenty of warnings that a downturn in bitcoin's prices could lead to large selloffs.

Here's a look at bitcoin treasury companies by the numbers:

That's how many bitcoins owned by MicroStrategy – the undisputed goliath of bitcoin treasury companies.

With nearly 3% of the total bitcoin supply, MicroStrategy owns more bitcoins than every other bitcoin treasury company combined. It also owns more bitcoin than every nation state combined, according to the tracking site bitcointreasuries.net.

Now called Strategy, the software company first started buying bitcoin in 2020 with reserve cash. Now, its software business is a small part of a perpetual bitcoin-buying machine that uses a variety of strategies – like selling shares or issuing debt – to keep growing its bitcoin holdings.

That's how much MicroStrategy's stock price has increased in the last five years, compared to around 1,000% gain in bitcoin and the 1,500% jump for chipmaker and stock market darling Nvidia during that same period.

The company's success has boosted the profile of MicroStrategy's founder and chairman, Michael Saylor, who has visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago and the White House while becoming bitcoin's enigmatic high priest.

“Bitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy,” Saylor said in a social media post.

Saylor's success has also spawned many imitators.

“It's kind of shocking … that it took someone four years after Michael Saylor started doing it to finally do it and pull the trigger and now it feels like everyone's pulling the trigger,” said Eric Semler, the chairman of Semler Scientific, a healthcare company that started acquiring bitcoin last year.

That's the average purchase price of bitcoin for half of the 61 publicly traded bitcoin strategy companies, excluding bitcoin mining companies and bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to a recent analysis by Standard Chartered.

Geoff Kendrick, the bank's head of digital assets research, said in the report that restrictions on investors buying bitcoin directly help explain the popularity of bitcoin treasury companies, as their stocks can serve as bitcoin proxies. But as crypto becomes more mainstream, the case for investing in bitcoin treasury companies becomes weaker, Kendrick said.

He added that bitcoin's volatility could force some newer bitcoin treasury companies to sell their holdings to satisfy their debts if it falls under the purchase price.

“The question then becomes, how much pain can companies withstand before being forced to sell their BTC?” Kendrick said, referring to the symbol for bitcoin.

That's how much of a one-day percentage increase in stock prices firms have seen after recently announcing plans to hold other types of cryptocurrencies as corporate treasuries, highlighting how the appetite for such companies extends beyond bitcoin.

SharpLink Gaming, a gambling marketing firm, saw its share price increase by more than 400% after it announced plans to buy up to $425 million in Ethereum, the second most popular form of cryptocurrency. And crypto firm Upexi saw its stock price soar more than 300% after it announced plans to buy $100 million of Solana, a cryptocurrency popular in the meme coin ecosystem.

Digital Commercial Paper (DCP), a fixed income asset secured by U.S. Treasuries and rated Prime-1 by Moody's, is now live on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a public blockchain built for the efficient tokenization of real-world assets. 

Administered by Guggenheim Treasury Services, one of the largest independent commercial paper platform managers in the world, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Guggenheim Capital, DCP is tokenized, issued, and managed through the Zeconomy platform.

On the XRPL, DCP will leverage the network's fast settlement, low transaction costs, and round-the-clock accessibility, modernizing the issuance, transaction, and integration of commercial paper into global treasury and liquidity systems.

This expansion to the XRPL builds on DCP's initial launch in September 2024, which has already processed over $280 million in issuance. DCP is fully backed by maturity-matched U.S. Treasury securities and is offered daily at custom maturities of up to 397 days.

The asset has received a Prime-1 rating by Moody's, the highest rating available for a short-term debt instrument.

DCP is issued through a bankruptcy-remote special purpose vehicle (SPV), Great Bridge Capital Company, established by Guggenheim Treasury Services to ensure investor protections.

On the XRPL, DCP can offer institutional clients a highly efficient treasury management solution that can be seamlessly integrated into existing cross-border payment flows.

“We're at a tipping point where tokenization is evolving from experimentation to production in global financial markets,” said Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President of RippleX, said in a prepared statement. 

“Institutions are no longer asking if blockchain technology can support regulated financial products, they're asking how they can deploy them at scale. The inception of DCP is a prime example of this shift, and it expands the offering of institutional financial assets coming to the XRPL,"" Infanger added.

DCP offers an ideal solution for digital traders seeking a yield-bearing, on-chain asset to use as collateral in their strategies.

“Zeconomy's platform delivers institutional-grade modules and a powerful toolkit that brings corporations and traditional finance participants together to solve real-world problems on-chain,” said Giacinto Cosenza, CEO at Zeconomy, in a statement. “The expansion of DCP to the XRPL is a key marker for the future of tokenized finance, combining institutional strength with the enterprise focus of Ripple.""

Ripple will invest in DCP as part of its broader effort to bring institutional real-world assets to the XRPL.

This builds on Ripple's investment in tokenized U.S. Treasuries through projects such as Ondo's OUSG and Archax and abrdn's money market fund.

DCP is available exclusively to Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) and Qualified Purchasers (QPs) as defined under applicable securities laws

Long-term holder (LTH) bitcoin supply, as tracked by Glassnode, has surged to a record 14.46 million BTC, signaling confidence that price gains are in store. 

LTHs, defined as investors holding bitcoin BTC$108,810.73 for at least 155 days, are often seen as ""smart money,"" strategically buying during price dips and selling during bull market peaks. This all-time high in LTH supply suggests that seasoned investors anticipate higher prices, a pattern historically associated with significant price rallies. 

From March to June, LTH supply increased by approximately 500,000 BTC, while short-term holders (STHs) sold around 350,000 BTC



Many investors now classified as LTH entered the market amid the euphoria of January's Trump inauguration and $109,000 record. Five months later, having endured a 30% correction and now the bounce back to a record, these LTH's are demonstrating resilience.

LTHs currently represent about 73% of bitcoin's circulating supply of 19.88 million BTC, underscoring their dominance in the market. This concentration of bitcoin in long-term hands, suggests potential for further price upside.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens UNI, AAVE and SKY all rose by more than 20% on optimistic comments from SEC Chair Paul Atkins at a Monday roundtable discussion about the sector.

Atkins instructed the regulator to explore exemptions to let decentralized finance (DeFi) firms conduct operations without as many restrictions.

""The right to have self-custody of one's private property is a foundational American value,"" he said.

The comments are a stark contrast to those made by the previous commission led by Gary Gensler, which was criticized for stifling innovation by imposing restrictive guidance on crypto firms.

 Bitcoin exposure may provide a lucrative financial opportunity for Apple's stock buyback program, according to Michael Saylor. 

Apple, the world's fourth-largest company by market capitalization, should buy Bitcoin (BTC) to address the poor performance of its stock buyback program, according to Strategy executive chairman, Michael Saylor.

“Apple should buy Bitcoin,” Saylor said in a June 10 X post.

Saylor's comment responded to Jim Cramer's criticism of the Apple buyback program.

“The Apple buyback is not working right now,” Cramer wrote in a June 10 X post. 

“The company can leave it to earn a lot or it can take some and integrate. It is not a badge of dishonor. It just isn't,” he added.

Apple's buyback program aims to reduce the number of outstanding shares and return value to investors, according to the $110 billion stock buyback strategy announced in a May 2024 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

However, Apple's stock has declined more than 17% since the start of the year.

Over the same period, Bitcoin has gained more than 17%, according to data from TradingView. Zooming out, Bitcoin has surged over 1,000% in the past five years, compared with a 137% increase in Apple shares.

On May 28, US video game and consumer electronics retailer GameStop announced its first Bitcoin investment, acquiring 4,710 BTC for around $513 million after the firm launched a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering.

Japanese investment company Metaplanet is spearheading Bitcoin adoption in Asia after becoming the world's eighth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder on June 2.

Metaplanet's shares soared over 12% during Monday's trading session after the company announced plans to raise $5.4 billion worth of capital to buy more Bitcoin.

Over in Europe, Paris-based cryptocurrency firm The Blockchain Group announced plans to raise over $340 million for its Bitcoin treasury, Cointelegraph reported on Monday.

 A new report from Bitget, SlowMist and Elliptic highlights the severity of deepfake scams, urging both individuals and organizations to adopt more stringent preventive measures. 

The rise of artificial intelligence is fueling a sharp increase in crypto-related fraud, with deepfake technology driving a surge in sophisticated scams, according to a new report.

In the first quarter of 2025, at least 87 scam rings using AI-generated deepfakes were dismantled, according to the 2025 Anti-Scam Research Report co-authored by crypto exchange Bitget, blockchain security firm SlowMist, and analytics provider Elliptic.

The report also reveals crypto scams reached $4.6 billion in 2024, marking a 24% increase from the year before. Nearly 40% of high-value fraud cases involved deepfake technologies, with scammers increasingly using sophisticated impersonations of public figures, founders and platform executives to deceive users.

Related: How AI and deepfakes are fueling new cryptocurrency scams

“The speed at which scammers can now generate synthetic videos, coupled with the viral nature of social media, gives deepfakes a unique advantage in both reach and believability,” said Gracy Chen, the CEO of Bitget.

The report details the anatomy of modern crypto scams, pointing to three dominant categories: AI-generated deepfake impersonations, social engineering schemes, and Ponzi-style frauds disguised as decentralized finance (DeFi) or GameFi projects. Deepfakes, it warned, are especially hard to detect.

AI can simulate text, voice messages, facial expressions and even actions. For example, fake video endorsements of investment platforms from public figures such as Singapore's prime minister and Elon Musk are tactics used to exploit public trust via Telegram, X and other social media platforms.

AI can even simulate real-time reactions, making these scams increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality. Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of the blockchain platform Polygon, raised the alarm in a May 13 post on X, revealing that bad actors had been impersonating him via Zoom. 

He mentioned that several people had contacted him on Telegram asking if he was on a Zoom call with them and whether he was requesting them to install a script.

SlowMist CEO Yu Xian urged users to verify the legitimacy of Zoom links and domain names to avoid falling victim to video-based impersonation scams.  

As deepfake scams grow more convincing, security experts say education and vigilance are critical. For institutions, regular security training and strong technical defenses are essential, the report stated. Businesses are advised to run phishing simulations, protect email systems and monitor code for leaks. Building a security-first culture — where employees verify before they trust — is the best way to stop scams before they start, the report added.

Chen offered everyday users a straightforward approach: “Verify, isolate, and slow down.” She added:

Chen also stressed the importance of isolating risky actions by using separate wallets when exploring new platforms.

 The Bank of Japan's June meeting could trigger a Bitcoin rally if it restarts quantitative easing, as bond yield concerns push institutions toward BTC as a hedge. 

The Bank of Japan's (BOJ) upcoming monetary policy meeting in June may provide the next significant catalyst for global risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies.

The BoJ is set to take its next interest rate decision at its upcoming monetary policy meeting on June 16–17.

The central bank may provide the next significant catalyst for Bitcoin (BTC) and other risk assets if it pivots to quantitative easing (QE), according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and chief investment officer of Maelstrom.

“If the BOJ delays QT, and restarts selected QE at its June meeting risk assets are going to fly,” Hayes wrote in a June 10 X post.

QE refers to central banks buying bonds and pumping money into the economy to lower interest rates and encourage spending during difficult financial conditions.

On July 31, 2024, the Bank of Japan introduced a plan to cut government bond purchases by 400 billion yen per quarter, starting in August 2024. The quantitative tightening plan is set for an interim assessment period at the upcoming meeting on June 16, signaling a potential opportunity to pivot.

BoJ officials are reportedly discussing making smaller reductions to the bank's bond buying, from the current 400 billion to 200 billion yen per quarter, starting from April 2027, unnamed sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.

Bitcoin rose to the $112,000 all-time high on May 22, two days after the 30-year yield on Japanese bonds reached a new all-time high of 3.185% on May 20, 2025.

The concerns around Japan's sovereign bond market inspired institutions to reconsider Bitcoin's role as a hedge against sovereign default risks, according to Bitwise's head of European research, André Dragosch.

“Perceived default risk continues rising, yields continue rising? This is a rough benchmark of why Bitcoin could be heading toward $200,000,” Dragosch told Cointelegraph, adding that Bitcoin is “free from counterparty risk.”

Government bonds are typically considered safe-haven assets. But when yields rise sharply, it often signals investor concerns about fiscal sustainability and repayment risk.

What a Wandering Mind Learns

Zoning out reveals hidden patterns in tasks

By Nora Bradford edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

While you do the dishes or drive to work, your mind is likely not on the task at hand; perhaps you're composing a grocery list or daydreaming about retiring in Italy. But research published in the Journal of Neuroscience suggests you might be taking in more than you think.

During a simple task that requires minimal attention, mind wandering may actually help people learn probabilistic patterns that let them perform the task better.

“The idea to study the potentially beneficial influence of mind wandering on information processing occurred to us during the COVID pandemic, when we had plenty of time to mind wander,” says Péter Simor, lead author of the recent study and a psychology researcher at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest. Study participants practiced a simple task in which they pressed keyboard buttons corresponding to the direction of arrows that lit up on a screen. But there were patterns hidden within the task that the participants were unaware of—and they learned these patterns without consciously noticing them. The researchers found that when participants reported letting their minds wander, they adapted to the task's hidden patterns significantly faster.

“This is an exciting and important piece of work, especially because the authors opted for a nondemanding task to check how [mind wandering] would affect performance and learning,” says Athena Demertzi, a cognitive and clinical neuroscientist at the University of Liège in Belgium. Previous related research focused more on long and demanding tasks, she says—on which zoning out is typically shown to have a negative effect.

But the results are not clear-cut, says Jonathan Smallwood, a psychology researcher at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. “I don't think that this means the spontaneous mind-wandering episodes themselves cause implicit learning to occur,” he says. “Rather both emerge at the same time when people go into a particular state.” Neither Smallwood nor Demertzi was involved in the new study.

Simor, who studies sleep, was interested in whether participants' mind wandering displayed any neural hallmarks of dozing off. Using electroencephalogram recordings, the team showed that in those test periods, participants' brains produced more of the slow waves that are dominant during sleep. Perhaps, the researchers say, mind wandering is like a form of light sleep that provides some of that state's learning benefits. To better understand whether mind wandering might compensate for lost sleep, Simor and his colleagues next plan to study narcolepsy and sleep deprivation.

“We know that people spend significant amounts of time not focused on what they are doing,” Smallwood says. “The authors' work is important because it helps us understand how reasonably complex forms of behavior can continue when people are focused on other things—and that even though our thoughts were elsewhere, the external behavior can still leave its mark on the person.”

Local weather alerts are familiar warnings for potentially dangerous conditions, but an alert that puts all of Earth on warning is rare.

On May 31, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory's (NRL) space-based instrumentation captured real-time observations of a powerful Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) that erupted from the Sun initiating a ""severe geomagnetic storm"" alert for Earth.

""Our observations demonstrated that the eruption was a so-called 'halo CME,' meaning it was Earth-directed, with our preliminary analysis of the data showing an apparent velocity of over 1,700 kilometers per second for the event,"" stated Karl Battams, Ph.D., computational scientist for NRL's Heliospheric Science Division.

A geomagnetic storm is a major disturbance of Earth's magnetosphere that's caused by the highly efficient transfer of energy from the solar wind into our planet's surrounding space environment. These disruptions are primarily driven by sustained periods of high-speed solar wind and, crucially, a southward-directed solar wind magnetic field that can peel away Earth's field on the dayside of the magnetosphere. Energy from the solar wind can open Earth's magnetic shield.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center classified the recent solar storm as G4, the second-highest classification on its five-level geomagnetic scale.

Powerful storms such as this are typically associated with CMEs. The repercussions can range from temporary outages and data corruption to permanent damage to satellites, increased atmospheric drag on low-Earth orbit spacecraft altering their trajectories, and disruptions to high-frequency radio communications.

""Such disturbances can compromise situational awareness, hinder command and control, affect precision-guided systems, and even impact the electrical power grid, directly affecting military readiness and operational effectiveness,"" Battams said.

CMEs are colossal expulsions of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun's corona, often carrying billions of tons of material. While CMEs generally take several days to reach Earth, the most intense events have been observed to arrive in as little as 18 hours.

""CMEs are the explosive release of mass from the Sun's low corona and are a primary driver of space weather, playing a central role in understanding the conditions of the Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere,"" explained Arnaud Thernisien, Ph.D., a research physicist from the Advanced Sensor Technology Section within NRL's Space Science Division.

The May 30 event saw a relatively slow but powerful solar flare erupt from the Earth-facing side of the Sun. The energy released blasted a CME directly toward Earth, leading to the geomagnetic storm that has produced auroras as far south as New Mexico.

NRL's space-based instrumentation, operating on NASA and NOAA spacecraft, provided vital real-time observations of this event. Notably, NRL's venerable Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO), which has been in operation since 1996, and the Compact Coronagraph 1 (CCOR-1), launched in 2024, both relayed critical data.

Such observations are paramount for operational space weather monitoring, allowing forecasters to predict the timing of the event's arrival at Earth and the potential geomagnetic storm it could induce. While precisely predicting the severity, exact timing, or duration of a geomagnetic storm remains challenging, these advance warnings are vital for enabling the Department of Defense (DoD) and other agencies to prepare.

The potential impacts of severe geomagnetic storms on DoD and Department of the Navy missions are significant and far-reaching. These events can disrupt or degrade critical systems and capabilities, including satellite communications, Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation and timing, and various remote sensing systems.

""NRL has been a pioneer in heliophysics and space weather research since the very inception of the field, dating back to the first discovery of CMEs through NRL space-based observations in 1971,"" Battams said. ""Since then, NRL has consistently maintained its position at the forefront of coronal imaging with a portfolio of groundbreaking instrumentation that has driven heliospheric and space weather studies.""

This includes:

These assets, particularly instruments like LASCO and CCOR-1, are indispensable for providing the crucial real-time imagery necessary for forecasters to analyze and assess CMEs, determine Earth-impact likelihood, and issue timely warnings.

""They form the backbone of our ability to anticipate and mitigate the effects of space weather. As the G4 severe geomagnetic storm watch continues, the public and critical infrastructure operators are encouraged to visit NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center for the latest information and updates,"" Thernisien said.

The journey of the CME, from its fierce eruption on the Sun to its arrival at Earth, approximately one million miles away, highlights the dynamic nature of our solar system and the ongoing importance of NRL's vital contributions to heliophysics research and space weather preparedness. The data collected from events such as this will be instrumental in future research, further enhancing our understanding and predictive capabilities and ultimately bolstering the resilience of national security and critical infrastructure.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","How madagascar's lizards became the island's last hope for reforestation","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250610004054.htm","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 08:37:59 GMT","

After the island of Madagascar drifted away from India 88 million years ago, isolating it from all other landmasses, its flora and fauna evolved in seclusion. As these transformed into plants and animals completely unique to their island, Madagascar became a biodiversity hotspot unlike anywhere else on Earth.

An important facet of this biodiversity is an ecological process called endozoochory, which is when animals eat plant seeds and then poop them out somewhere else, aiding in the spread of the plants. Most research on endozoochory has focused on the roles of birds and mammals as seed dispersers, but lizards, which are also known play a significant role, have remained largely overlooked.

This negligence inspired a team of researchers at Kyoto University to shine a spotlight on the humble lizard. Unlike many seed dispersers, lizards are not typically frugivores, animals that thrive on fruit and other fruit-like plant substances such as nuts and seeds. Fewer than 10% of lizard species have been reported to consume fruits, but those that do can play an important role, and some lizards are even known to act as primary seed dispersers for certain plant species.

""Lizards are under-appreciated as seed dispersers in many forest ecosystems, but we hypothesized that they may play a more important role across a broader range of regions than previously recognized,"" says corresponding author Ryobu Fukuyama.

The research team focused on three lizard species in a tropical dry forest in Madagascar, conducting behavioral observations, fecal analyses, and seed germination tests. The species, the Malagasy Giant Chameleon, Cuvier's Madagascar Swift, and the Western Girdled Lizard, are omnivores known to subsist on fruits, but they had not yet been carefully studied.

The team's results revealed that the lizards consumed fruits from over 20 plant species and expelled viable seeds. These plant species were largely different from those typically consumed by the Common Brown Lemur, a principal seed disperser in Madagascar's forests, indicating the lizards may play a more crucial role than previously thought.

Their project isn't only about acknowledging the importance of lizards, however. In recent years, environmental degradation caused by human activities has taken a toll on Malagasy forests, making some uninhabitable for large frugivores like lemurs. In contrast, the lizard species observed in this study can continue to inhabit these degraded environments. As seed dispersers, these lizards could potentially contribute to forest regeneration, but there are still many unknowns.

""Although lizards in Madagascar consume fruits from many plant species, other aspects of their role as seed dispersers, such as dispersal distances, remain poorly understood,"" says Fukuyama. In the future, the team intends to focus further on these additional unknowns.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Sharper than lightning: Oxford's one-in-6. 7-million quantum breakthrough","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250610074301.htm","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 13:50:49 GMT","

Physicists at the University of Oxford have set a new global benchmark for the accuracy of controlling a single quantum bit, achieving the lowest-ever error rate for a quantum logic operation -- just 0.000015%, or one error in 6.7 million operations. This record-breaking result represents nearly an order of magnitude improvement over the previous benchmark, set by the same research group a decade ago.

To put the result in perspective: a person is more likely to be struck by lightning in a given year (1 in 1.2 million) than for one of Oxford's quantum logic gates to make a mistake.

The findings, published in Physical Review Letters, are a major advance towards having robust and useful quantum computers.

""As far as we are aware, this is the most accurate qubit operation ever recorded anywhere in the world,"" said Professor David Lucas, co-author on the paper, from the University of Oxford's Department of Physics. ""It is an important step toward building practical quantum computers that can tackle real-world problems.""

To perform useful calculations on a quantum computer, millions of operations will need to be run across many qubits. This means that if the error rate is too high, the final result of the calculation will be meaningless. Although error correction can be used to fix mistakes, this comes at the cost of requiring many more qubits. By reducing the error, the new method reduces the number of qubits required and consequently the cost and size of the quantum computer itself.

Co-lead author Molly Smith (Graduate Student, Department of Physics, University of Oxford), said: ""By drastically reducing the chance of error, this work significantly reduces the infrastructure required for error correction, opening the way for future quantum computers to be smaller, faster, and more efficient. Precise control of qubits will also be useful for other quantum technologies such as clocks and quantum sensors.""

This unprecedented level of precision was achieved using a trapped calcium ion as the qubit (quantum bit). These are a natural choice to store quantum information due to their long lifetime and their robustness. Unlike the conventional approach, which uses lasers, the Oxford team controlled the quantum state of the calcium ions using electronic (microwave) signals.

This method offers greater stability than laser control and also has other benefits for building a practical quantum computer. For instance, electronic control is much cheaper and more robust than lasers, and easier to integrate in ion trapping chips. Furthermore, the experiment was conducted at room temperature and without magnetic shielding, thus simplifying the technical requirements for a working quantum computer.

The previous best single-qubit error rate, also achieved by the Oxford team, in 2014, was 1 in 1 million. The group's expertise led to the launch of the spinout company Oxford Ionics in 2019, which has become an established leader in high-performance trapped-ion qubit platforms.

Whilst this record-breaking result marks a major milestone, the research team caution that it is part of a larger challenge. Quantum computing requires both single- and two-qubit gates to function together. Currently, two-qubit gates still have significantly higher error rates -- around 1 in 2000 in the best demonstrations to date -- so reducing these will be crucial to building fully fault-tolerant quantum machines.

The experiments were carried out at the University of Oxford's Department of Physics by Molly Smith, Aaron Leu, Dr Mario Gely and Professor David Lucas, together with a visiting researcher, Dr Koichiro Miyanishi, from the University of Osaka's Centre for Quantum Information and Quantum Biology.

The Oxford scientists are part of the UK Quantum Computing and Simulation (QCS) Hub, which was a part of the ongoing UK National Quantum Technologies Programme.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists may have spotted a giant new planet forming","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250610004044.htm","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 06:12:49 GMT","

An international team of astronomers led by University of Galway, has discovered the likely site of a new planet in formation, most likely a gas giant planet up to a few times the mass of Jupiter.

Using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (ESO's VLT) in Chile, the researchers captured spectacular images around a distant young star for the first time in the form of scattered near-infrared light that revealed an exceptionally structured disk.

The European Southern Observatory (ESO), the world's foremost international astronomy organization, has published a stunning view of the new planet-forming disk as their picture of the week.

The disk extends out to 130 astronomical units from its parent star -- the equivalent to 130 times the distance between Earth and the Sun. It shows a bright ring followed by a gap centered at roughly 50 astronomical units.

For comparison, the outermost planet in our solar system, Neptune, has an orbital distance from the Sun of 30 astronomical units.

Inside the disk gap, reminiscent of the outskirts of a hurricane on Earth, a system of spiral arms are visible. While appearing tiny in the image, the inner part of this planet-forming system measures 40 astronomical units in radius and would swallow all of the planets in our own solar system.

The study was led by Dr Christian Ginski from the Center for Astronomy in the School of Natural Sciences at University of Galway and was co-authored by four postgraduate students at the University.

Dr Christian Ginski, lecturer at the School of Natural Sciences, University of Galway and lead author of the paper, said: ""While our team has now observed close to 100 possible planet-forming disks around nearby stars, this image is something special. One rarely finds a system with both rings and spiral arms in a configuration that almost perfectly fits the predictions of how a forming planet is supposed to shape its parent disk according to theoretical models. Detections like this bring us one step closer to understand how planets form in general and how our solar system might have formed in the distant past.""

The study has been published in the international journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.

Dr Ginski said: ""Besides this exceptionally beautiful planet-forming cradle there is something else that I find quite special about this study. Along with the large international team that we assembled for these observations, four of our own University of Galway graduate students were involved in this study. Without the critical help of Chloe Lawlor, Jake Byrne, Dan McLachlan and Matthew Murphy we would not have been able to finalize the analysis of these new results. It is my great privilege to work with such talented young researchers.""

Chloe Lawlor, PhD student in Physics with a specialization in Astrophysics, University of Galway, said: ""Working with Dr Christian Ginski on the 2MASS1612 paper has been an incredible experience. As an early-career researcher, having the opportunity to contribute to such exciting work has been especially rewarding. This work has been the perfect introduction to scientific writing and collaboration, and I'm very grateful for this kick-start to my research career.""

Jake Byrne, MSc student in Physics with a specialization in Astrophysics, University of Galway, said: ""It's an exciting time to be involved in planet formation theory at the University of Galway. There was a strong sense of collaboration among everyone involved in this paper, and I'm grateful to have been part of it. It's been a great introduction into what I hope to be a long career in research.""

Dan McLachlan, MSc student in Physics with a specialization in Astrophysics, University of Galway, said: ""I found it quite a thrilling experience to be making my first contribution to an astrophysics publication and was very grateful for the opportunity provided by being a part of Dr Ginski's research group. I also honed my academic writing skills in stepping up to the challenge and learned a few analytical techniques that will be of vital use in my own future research work.""

The wider research team included colleagues in the UK, Germany, Australia, USA, Netherlands, Italy, Chile, France, Japan.

The scientific paper speculates on the presence of a planet based on its structure and the rings and spirals observed in the disk. It also notes some tentative atmospheric emission of just such a planet which the research team say requires further study to confirm.

Based on their research findings, Dr Ginski and his team have secured time at the world leading James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observatory in the upcoming observation cycle.

Using the unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Telescope, the team hopes to be able to take an actual image of the young planet. If planets in the disk are confirmed, it will become a prime laboratory for the study of planet-disk interaction.

Creatine, the supplement popular with athletes for its ability to help build strength and power, is increasingly being recognized for its broad health benefits.

The compound's usefulness extends well beyond the gym, according to Dr. Richard Kreider, professor and director of the Exercise & Sport Nutrition Lab at Texas A&M University. Kreider has spent more than 30 years investigating the effects of creatine, a naturally occurring compound stored in the muscle that combines with phosphate to form creatine phosphate, which is needed for cellular energy.

""When the body is stressed, like in exercise or under metabolic conditions like some diseases, creatine phosphate is needed to maintain energy in the cell, and therefore has a lot of protective and health benefits, in addition to the exercise performance effects that have been seen,"" Kreider said.

 How Much Creatine Do We Need? 

Our bodies create about a gram per day, but it's recommended to get two to four grams of creatine per day, depending on muscle mass and activity levels. According to Kreider, most people fall short of getting enough creatine from diet alone. The best sources of creatine in the diet are meat and fish.

""You only get about a gram of creatine per pound of red meat or fish, like salmon, so it's expensive and takes a lot of calories to get a gram,"" Kreider said. This is why supplementation matters, especially for vegetarians or vegans who do not consume enough creatine in their diet.

For athletes with performance-related goals, Kreider said it's recommended to supplement 5 grams, four times a day for a week. Supplementation ""helps load the muscle up with more energy,"" which makes for improved high-intensity exercise, recovery and even cognitive function. After that, consuming 5 to 10 grams per day will maintain creatine stores and provide enough creatine for the brain.

Beyond boosting athletic performance, creatine is important for everyone as they age throughout their lives, Kreider said. It can help older adults who lose muscle mass and cognitive function as they age, he said, and in adolescents, low dietary creatine intake is associated with slower growth, less muscle mass and higher body fat.

 Is Creatine Safe? 

In a comprehensive review published in February in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition, Kreider and colleagues analyzed 685 clinical trials on creatine supplementation to assess its safety and the frequency of reported side effects. The analysis showed there were no significant differences in the rate of side effects for participants taking a placebo and those taking creatine.

As for anecdotal concerns like bloating or cramping, Kreider says those claims don't hold up under scrutiny, and studies have shown creatine can actually prevent cramping because it helps the body retain more fluid.

Despite the strong evidence base, Kreider said creatine has long been the subject of misconceptions and misinformation. He's among the members of the International Society of Sports Nutrition who recently issued a letter affirming the safety and efficacy of creatine, urging lobbyists and policymakers not to restrict access to it.

""There's absolutely no data supporting any negative side effect anecdotally reported about creatine on the internet and in the media,"" he said. ""Creatine is safe, and it's important for everybody, not just bodybuilders and athletes.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists uncover why ""stealth"" volcanoes stay silent until eruption","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250610074307.htm","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 13:43:01 GMT","

When volcanoes are preparing to erupt, scientists rely on typical signs to warn people living nearby: deformation of the ground and earthquakes, caused by underground chambers filling up with magma and volcanic gas. But some volcanoes, called 'stealthy' volcanoes, don't give obvious warning signs. Now scientists studying Veniaminof, Alaska, have developed a model which could explain and predict stealthy eruptions.

""Despite major advances in monitoring, some volcanoes erupt with little or no detectable precursors, significantly increasing the risk to nearby populations,"" said Dr Yuyu Li of the University of Illinois, lead author of the study in Frontiers in Earth Science. ""Some of these volcanoes are located near major air routes or close to communities: examples include Popocatépetl and Colima in Mexico, Merapi in Indonesia, Galeras in Colombia, and Stromboli in Italy.

""Our work helps explain how this happens, by identifying the key internal conditions -- such as low magma supply and warm host rock -- that make eruptions stealthy.""

Warning signs 

Veniaminof is an ice-clad volcano in the Aleutian Arc of Alaska. It's carefully monitored, but only two of its 13 eruptions since 1993 have been preceded by enough signs to alert observing scientists. In fact, a 2021 eruption wasn't caught until three days after it had started.

""Veniaminof is a case study in how a volcano can appear quiet while still being primed to erupt,"" said Li. ""It is one of the most active volcanoes in Alaska. In recent decades, it has produced several VEI 3 eruptions -- moderate-sized explosive events that can send ash up to 15 km high, disrupt air traffic, and pose regional hazards to nearby communities and infrastructure -- often without clear warning signs.""

To understand Veniaminof better, the scientists used monitoring data over three summer seasons immediately before the 2018 stealthy eruption, which produced only ambiguous warning signs immediately before it happened. They created a model of the volcano's behavior in different conditions which would change the impact of a filling magma reservoir on the ground above: six potential volumes of magma reservoir, a range of magma flow rates and reservoir depths, and three shapes of reservoir. They then compared the models to the data to see which matched best, and which conditions produced eruptions, stealthy or otherwise.

Volcano by the numbers 

They found that a high flow of magma into a chamber increases the deformation of the ground and the likelihood of an eruption. If magma is flowing quickly into a large chamber, an eruption may not occur, but if one does the ground will deform enough to warn scientists first. Similarly, a high flow of magma into a small chamber is likely to produce an eruption, but not a stealthy one. Stealthy eruptions become likely when a low flow of magma enters a relatively small chamber. Compared to observational data, the results suggest that Veniaminof has a small magma chamber and a low flow of magma.

The model also suggests that different conditions could produce different warning signs. Magma flowing into larger, flatter chambers may cause minimal earthquakes, while smaller, more elongated chambers may produce little deformation of the ground. But stealthy eruptions only happen when all the conditions are in place -- the right magma flow and the right chamber size, shape, and depth.

However, when the scientists added temperature to their model, they found that if magma is consistently present over time so that the rock of the chamber is warm, size and shape matters less. If the rock is warm, it's less likely to fail in ways that cause detectable earthquakes or deformation of the ground when magma flows into the chamber, increasing the likelihood of a stealthy eruption.

What next? 

""To mitigate the impact of these potential surprise eruptions, we need to integrate high-precision instruments like borehole tiltmeters and strainmeters and fiber optic sensing, as well as newer approaches such as infrasound and gas emission monitoring,"" said Li. ""Machine learning has also shown promise in detecting subtle changes in volcanic behavior, especially in earthquake signal picking.""

At Veniaminof, taking measures to improve the coverage of satellite monitoring and adding tiltmeters and strainmeters could improve the rate of detection. In the meantime, scientists now know which volcanoes they need to watch most closely: volcanoes with small, warm reservoirs and slow magma flows.

""Combining these models with real-time observations represents a promising direction for improving volcano forecasting,"" said Li. ""In the future, this approach can enable improved monitoring for these stealthy systems, ultimately leading to more effective responses to protect nearby communities.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists reveal the hidden pause that keeps bee colonies alive","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250610004050.htm","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 07:18:19 GMT","

Some queens don't rule nonstop. A new study from the University of California, Riverside shows that even bumble bee queens, the sole founders of their colonies, take regular breaks from reproduction -- likely to avoid burning out before their first workers arrive.

In the early stages of colony building, bumblebee queens shoulder the entire workload. They forage for food, incubate their developing brood by heating them with their wing muscles, maintain the nest, and lay eggs. It's a high-stakes balancing act: without the queen, the colony fails. Yet, researchers noticed an intriguing rhythm: a burst of egg-laying followed by several days of apparent inactivity.

""I saw these pauses early on, just by taking daily photos of the nests,"" said Blanca Peto, a doctoral student in entomology at UC Riverside and lead author of the new study. ""It wasn't something I expected. I wanted to know what was happening during those breaks.""

The findings are detailed in a paper published in BMC Ecology and Evolution.

To find out what triggered the pauses, Peto monitored more than 100 queens over a period of 45 days in a controlled insectary. She documented each queen's nesting activity, looking closely at their distinctive clutches -- clusters of eggs laid in wax-lined ""cups"" embedded in pollen mounds. Across the population, a pattern emerged: Many queens paused reproduction for several days, typically after a stretch of intense egg-laying.

The timing of these pauses appeared to align with the developmental stages of the existing brood. To test this, Peto experimentally added broods at different stages -- young larvae, older larvae, and pupae -- into nests during a queen's natural pause. The presence of pupae, which are nearly mature bees, prompted queens to resume egg-laying within about 1.5 days. In contrast, without added broods, the pauses stretched to an average of 12.5 days.

This suggests that queens respond to cues from their developing offspring and time their reproductive efforts accordingly.

""There's something about the presence of pupae that signals it's safe or necessary to start producing again,"" Peto said. ""It's a dynamic process, not constant output like we once assumed.""

Eusocial insects, including bumble bees, feature overlapping generations, cooperative brood care, and a division of labor. Conventional thinking about these types of insects is that they're producing young across all stages of development. However, Peto said this study challenges that conventional thinking about bumble bees, whose reproductive behavior is more nuanced and intermittent.

""What this study showed is that the queen's reproductive behavior is much more flexible than we thought,"" Peto said. ""This matters because those early days are incredibly vulnerable. If a queen pushes too hard too fast, the whole colony might not survive.""

The study focused on a single species native to the eastern U.S., but the implications could extend to other bumble bee species or even other eusocial insects. Queens in other species may also pace themselves during solo nest-founding stages. If so, this built-in rhythm could be an evolutionary trait that helps queens survive long enough to raise a workforce.

Multiple bumblebee populations in North America are declining, largely due to habitat loss, pesticide exposure, and climate stress. Understanding the biological needs of queens, the literal foundation of each colony, can help conservationists better protect them.

""Even in a lab where everything is stable and they don't have to forage, queens still pause,"" Peto said. ""It tells us this isn't just a response to stress but something fundamental. They're managing their energy in a smart way.""

This kind of insight is possible thanks to patient, hands-on observation, something Peto prioritized in her first research project as a graduate student.

""Without queens, there's no colony. And without colonies, we lose essential pollinators,"" Peto said. ""These breaks may be the very reason colonies succeed.""

Metrics details

Individual sensitivity to environmental exposures may be genetically influenced. This genotype-by-environment interplay implies differences in phenotypic variance across genotypes, but these variants have proven challenging to detect. Genome-wide association studies of monozygotic twin differences are conducted through family-based variance analyses, which are more robust to the systemic biases that impact population-based methods. We combined data from 21,792 monozygotic twins (10,896 pairs) from 11 studies to conduct one of the largest genome-wide association study meta-analyses of monozygotic phenotypic differences, in children, adolescents and adults separately, for seven psychiatric and neurodevelopmental phenotypes: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms, autistic traits, anxiety and depression symptoms, psychotic-like experiences, neuroticism and wellbeing. The proportions of phenotypic variance explained by single-nucleotide polymorphisms in these phenotypes were estimated (h2 = 0–18%), but were imprecise. We identified 13 genome-wide significant associations (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, genes and gene sets), including genes related to stress reactivity for depression, growth factor-related genes for autistic traits and catecholamine uptake-related genes for psychotic-like experiences. This is the largest genetic study of monozygotic twins to date by an order of magnitude, evidencing an alternative method to study the genetic architecture of environmental sensitivity. The statistical power was limited for some analyses, calling for better-powered future studies.

Complex phenotypes are likely to be affected by genetic and environmental factors and their interactions. Interactions between genetic variants and the environment increase phenotypic variability1,2, which may be reflected in differences in the mean and/or variance of a phenotype in a population. This is evidenced when a genotype is associated with phenotype levels only under certain environmental conditions. Environmental sensitivity can also increase the variance of a trait if a genotype produces a wide range of phenotypes depending on environmental exposures, which may or may not also affect its population mean. Genetic knowledge of environmental sensitivity is most consistently exploited in bioengineering and evidenced in behavioural ecology, but it has been extremely challenging to evaluate in humans, especially for psychiatric disorders3. Understanding the genetic basis of environmental sensitivity is crucial for improving human health, as it informs on the biological pathways implicated in variations in responses to environmental exposures.

In contrast with most GWASs, which estimate associations of genetic variants and phenotypic means, Genome-wide variance quantitative trait locus (vQTL) analysis4,5 aims to discover genetic variants associated with phenotypic variance, which can be prioritized for a statistical test of gene–environment interaction6. However, phenotypic variance may be affected not only by gene–environment interactions1, but also by selection7, phantom vQTLs8 and epistasis4. It is therefore challenging to robustly determine which potential mechanisms have given rise to the observed trait variance associated with a vQTL. Furthermore, commonly used population-based methods for estimating genetic effects using unrelated individuals suffer from variance inflation9, bias due to insufficient correction of demographic and indirect genetic effects10, and unstable test statistics for vQTLs when tested loci are in linkage disequilibrium with additive effects11. Although statistical correction for certain observed demographic effects (for example, age and sex) is possible, unobserved confounders (for example, residual population stratification, dynastic effects via parents, and assortative mating) cannot be corrected for.

GWASs of monozygotic (MZ) twin differences provide an alternative, family-based approach to estimating vQTLs that is less susceptible to these sources of bias12 and can therefore more reliably identify variants that reflect environmental sensitivity.

MZ twins are nearly identical genetically. Therefore, within-pair phenotypic differences are probably due to chance or the environment13. Somatic mutations may also play a role in MZ differences for chromosomal and rare diseases14, but are unlikely to play a systematic role in common and polygenic complex traits15. Although all MZ twin pairs have the same degree of genetic similarity, they have varying degrees of phenotypic similarity. Greater within-pair differences in a population of MZ twins therefore reflect the pairs' greater sensitivity to their non-shared environments. Jinks and Fulker16 proposed a test in MZ twins for which the association between MZ pair differences and MZ pair mean score is obtained, and they provided a full description of its standard biometrical terms. The rationale behind their test of genotype–environment interaction is the same one that underlies tests involving inbred lines of animals that detect genotype–environment interaction through the heterogeneity of within-strain variances. We may now take single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as measured genotype indicators and test for associations with within-pair differences.

A GWAS of MZ phenotypic differences can identify the loci associated with variations in environmental sensitivity while also controlling for dynastic and epistatic effects, which are difficult to account for in population-based approaches (Fig. 1 provides a schematic of a GWAS of MZ differences). Although this approach has been advocated for because it facilitates understanding of the genetics of environmental sensitivity12, the requirement for a large sample of MZ twins has been a major impediment to progress in this field. In this Article, we report the findings from a GWAS meta-analysis of MZ differences for seven psychological phenotypes, using data from up to 21,792 MZ twins (10,896 pairs) from 11 studies. This is the largest GWAS conducted on MZ twin differences to date, representing an order of magnitude more participants than two previous MZ twin differences GWAS17,18. We conducted meta-analyses separately for children, adolescents and adults and identified 13 genome-wide significant associations across the phenotypes studied. This enabled us to estimate the SNP heritability (that is, the proportion of a trait's variance that can be attributed to genetic variation explained by SNPs) of environmental sensitivity to various mental health phenotypes (adolescent attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): h2 = 0.18 and s.e. = 0.11; child ADHD: h2 = 0.04 and s.e. = 0.06; adult autistic traits: h2 = 0.09 and s.e. = 0.15; depression: h2 = 0.03 and s.e. = 0.09). We also found that higher genetic liability to depression was associated with greater environmental sensitivity to depression in adults.

These analyses are conducted in three main steps: First, a quantitative phenotype value is obtained for a population of MZ twin pairs. Second, the absolute phenotypic difference score is calculated for each MZ pair. This score reflects phenotypic differences due to environmental effects, as the environment makes genetically identical twins diverge phenotypically. The absolute phenotypic difference is corrected for age, sex, ten genetic principal components and any study-specific covariates. The residuals are standardized and inverse rank transformed. Third, a GWAS of the MZ differences score is conducted, using the phenotypic differences score for one twin from each pair and their genotype data; therefore, the sample comprises unrelated individuals.

Our empirical analyses included a GWAS meta-analysis, gene-based and gene set analyses and Mendelian randomization analyses (Fig. 2 provides a flow chart for the study). Authors of contributing studies were asked to conduct GWASs of MZ differences separately for samples from child, adolescent and adult twins if repeated measures across lifespan were available. The study-level GWAS results were subjected to quality control and harmonization (Supplementary Information section 2.2) using EasyQC (version 23.8)19, then meta-analysed using the inverse-variance-weighted fixed-effect meta-analysis method in METAL (2011 release)20. GWAS meta-analyses were conducted using the largest available sample from each study and separately in developmentally stratified samples (Methods). GWAS meta-analysis results were quality controlled (Methods), then used for gene-based and gene set analyses using MAGMA (version 1.08) in the FUMA web application (version 1.5.2)21 and SNP heritability analyses using LDSC (version 1.0.1)22. We used Mendelian randomization to estimate the effects of psychological phenotypes (as reflected in GWAS associations with means) on phenotypic variance (Methods).

Flow chart genome-wide association meta-analysis of MZ twin differences in the present study. The eligibility criteria and developmental categories are described in the Methods. If multiple data points were available during the same developmental stage (for example, ages 7, 8 and 11 years), the largest sample was selected. Total n values per phenotype (representing the total across participating studies) were as follows: 13,738 (ADHD largest), 13,738 (ADHD child), 7,840 (ADHD adolescent), 12,354 (anxiety largest), 10,494 (anxiety child), 7,932 (anxiety adult), 14,152 (autistic traits largest), 13,130 (autistic traits child), 6,050 (autistic traits adult), 21,792 (depression largest), 10,510 (depression child), 18,074 (depression adult), 8,900 (neuroticism largest), 3,636 (psychotic-like experiences largest) and 13,740 (wellbeing largest). n values for GWAS analyses were halved as only data from one twin from each pair were included.

Table 1 shows descriptive statistics of the GWAS meta-analysis samples per phenotype. Supplementary Information Section 1.1 and the Supplementary Data present descriptives for all of the participating studies. The largest sample was for depression symptoms, with 21,792 MZ twins from 11 studies. The smallest was for psychotic-like experiences (PLEs; 3,636 twins from two cohorts). Mean MZ correlations across studies ranged between r = 0.31 for wellbeing and r = 0.71 for child ADHD. Overall, within-twin MZ correlations tended to be lower in samples from adult twins than those from child twins.

Meta-analyses for each phenotype identified two genome-wide significant variants (Table 2): one associated with variability in wellbeing (rs2940988; P = 9.93 × 10−9), located in the intronic region of the protein-coding chromosome 4 open reading frame 19 (C4orf19) gene; and one (rs60358762; P = 5.07 × 10−9) associated with variance in anxiety symptoms in adults, located in the intergenic region of the protein-coding SLC15A1 gene on chromosome 13. Manhattan plots, quantile–quantile (QQ) plots and the genomic regions of these genome-wide significant variants are presented in Fig. 3. No variants were genome-wide significantly associated with variance in the other phenotypes (Supplementary Table 4 provides the top SNPs for each phenotype). Supplementary Figs. 7–11 provide Manhattan and QQ plots for all of the tested phenotypes.

The red dashed lines indicate the genome-wide significant threshold of P = 5 × 10−8, corrected for multiple testing. b, Regional plots of independent significant SNPs for wellbeing (left; rs2940988; β = −0.16; P = 9.93 × 10−9) and anxiety (right; rs60358762; β  = 0.44; P = 5.07 × 10−9). SNPs not in linkage disequilibrium with significant independent lead SNPs in the selected region are coloured grey.

The MAGMA gene-based analysis (Methods) found several genes associated with phenotypic variability; however, only two associations passed the threshold for Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (Table 2). The patched 1 (PTCH1) gene was associated with variance in depression (P = 1.80 × 10−6) and the chromosome 15 open reading frame 38 (C15orf38) gene was associated with variance in anxiety symptoms (P = 2.00 × 10−7). Supplementary Figs. 12–16 and Supplementary Table 6 provide the top genes per phenotype.

The MAGMA competitive test of gene sets (Methods) identified nine significant associations after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (Table 2). Two gene sets were significantly associated with variance in depression symptoms, two with neuroticism, three with PLEs and two with autistic traits (one in samples from adults and one in samples from children). Supplementary Table 7 provides the top gene sets per phenotype, Supplementary Tables 8–11 provide details of significant gene sets and Supplementary Table 12 provides biological annotations for all genome-wide significant results.

We estimated the SNP heritability of MZ differences using LDSC (version 1.0.1)22 (Methods). The SNP heritability estimate of environmental sensitivity to ADHD symptoms in the samples from adolescents was 0.18 (s.e. = 0.11); the estimate in the samples from children was 0.04 (s.e. = 0.06). The SNP heritability estimate for environmental sensitivity to adult autistic traits was 0.09 (s.e. = 0.15) and for depression symptoms it was 0.03 (s.e. = 0.09 in children and s.e. = 0.06 in adults). All estimates, including those from the remaining phenotypes, were not statistically significant (Supplementary Table 13). We could not estimate the genetic correlation (rg) between all phenotypes because the SNP heritabilities were too low and imprecise, except for child and adolescent symptoms of ADHD (rg = 0.82; s.e. = 0.56; P = 0.15). Overall, despite this being one of the largest samples of MZ twins to date, low power resulted in large confidence intervals around the heritability estimates.

It has previously been speculated that environmental sensitivity might relate to polygenic liability rather than single loci, due to the environment interacting with a polygenic biological component23. We used Mendelian randomization to estimate the influence of the genetic liability of psychological phenotypes on their environmental sensitivity (Methods). We found a strong effect for depression (β = 0.84; s.e. = 0.26; P = 0.002). We also ran the analyses separately for our samples from children and those from adults (Fig. 4). The signal for depression was driven by analyses in adults (β = 1.58; s.e. = 0.29; P = 5 × 10−7), with the childhood association attenuated (β = 0.35; s.e. = 0.35; P = 0.36), and these estimates differed significantly (interaction P = 0.008). There was little evidence for heterogeneity of effect estimates across depression liability instruments. Other phenotypes did not exhibit an influence of liability on environmental sensitivity after correcting for multiple testing (Supplementary Table 14). We found little evidence that mean body mass indices and years of schooling affected phenotypic variance. Since vQTL effects could be biased by main effects, we conducted simulations to evaluate the sensitivity of the analytical approach to the Mendelian randomization results being driven by this bias (Supplementary Information section 7). We found that the MZ differences model can be liable to this problem under some phenotype normalization approaches, but that this was less likely to be driving the results in this study because we normalized by inverse rank transformation (Supplementary Fig. 17).

Genetic liability to depression, based on population studies is shown on the x axes and variance in depression scores (using 102 variants found to associate with depression incidence) is shown on the y axes. Genetic liability to depression increased the variability in depression outcomes and this was attenuated to the null in children (interaction term in linear regression P = 0.008). The error bars represent 95% confidence intervals of the variant effect estimates.

We used simulations to investigate the properties of the method used to detect MZ twin-based variance loci and compared them with those of population-based vQTL methods. First, we found that the MZ twin-based method has the greatest power when the narrow-sense heritability is highest (Fig. 5a) and the residual variance is lowest, and therefore when variance effects explain the larger fraction of the difference between MZ pairs, as was suggested previously12. Second, we found that for moderate heritability the MZ differences approach has substantially greater statistical power than the population-based approach when sample sizes are equal (that is, 10,000 MZ twin pairs using the MZ twin-based method versus 20,000 unrelated individuals using the population-based vQTL method). However, in practice, the number of population-based samples generally available drastically outstrips the number of MZ twin samples available. When using a more realistic sample size (for example, 10,000 MZ twin pairs versus 500,000 population samples), the MZ differences approach only achieves similar power to the population approach when narrow-sense heritability values are very high (for example, >0.9). It has recently been shown that a variant tested for interaction can have inflated test statistics when in linkage disequilibrium with a strong additive effect11, and we investigated whether that mechanism can also adversely impact MZ twin-based estimates. Our simulations show that this problem is substantially exacerbated through population-based vQTL methods compared with direct interaction tests, but the MZ twin-based approach is robust to this bias (Fig. 5b).

a, Comparison of the power between the MZ differences approach and the population-based approach (using the deviation regression model method) for detecting vQTLs. Comparisons were made between the MZ pairs approach and two different sample sizes for the population-based approach (one matching (with double the number of unrelated individuals; 20,000) and one with a typical sample size for modern GWASs (500,000)). The power of the MZ differences approach increases as the narrow-sense heritability increases. b, False discovery rates (y axis) due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a tagging causal variant (x axis), compared between the MZ differences approach (left) and population-based approach (right). The box plots represent interquartile ranges around median values of the simulations, with the whiskers representing ±1.5× the interquartile range and the points representing outliers. The presence of an additive causal variant tagging the tested SNP leads to elevated false discovery rates in the population approach, but not in the MZ differences approach.

Several genome-wide significant results were notable, including our finding that the PTCH1 gene was associated with variation in depression symptoms, as this gene has previously been reported to be associated with depression-related phenotypes, including neuroticism24,25, anxiety26, depression symptoms24, feeling emotionally hurt27 and sensitivity to environmental stress and adversity27. The C15orf38 gene (also known as ARPIN-AP3S2) was associated with variance in anxiety symptoms in our samples from children and has previously been associated with type 2 diabetes in adults25,28 and corticotropin-releasing factor protein levels29, which are involved in regulating anxiety, mood, eating and inflammation30. Hypoglycaemia symptoms in type 2 diabetes include a rapid heartbeat, sweating and nervousness, all of which are physical sensations associated with anxiety. It is possible that certain variants in this gene impact sensitivity to the effects of diet and stressors that are involved in the variability in insulin31, unpleasant physical sensations of which may be contextualized and made sense of as worries and anxieties (for example, the two-factor model of emotions32).

For autistic traits, the identified gene set included genes involved in tissue morphogenesis and healing that regulate the response to transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ1) levels and are involved in tissue repair pathways33. Growth factors serve important roles in neurodevelopment, immune function and development of the central nervous system and there is evidence that autism is associated with TGFβ1 and other growth factor-encoding genes34,35,36. For PLEs, the identified gene sets were related to the regulation of dopamine and catecholamine uptake. Our findings are supported by catecholamine's involvement in the stress response and the hypothesized role of dopamine system dysregulation in the aetiology of psychosis37. Since gene–environment interactions have been implicated in variations in PLEs38, the association between the biological processes implicated herein and variability in psychotic experiences may partly be under the influence of the environment.

We also estimated the SNP heritability of environmental sensitivity (adolescent ADHD: h2 = 0.18 and s.e. = 0.11; child ADHD: h2 = 0.04 and s.e. = 0.06; adult autistic traits: h2 = 0.09 and s.e. = 0.15; depression: h2 = 0.03 and s.e. = 0.09), but the estimates were not statistically significant. We also showed that variants that affect mean levels of depression and anxiety influence the variance of these phenotypes. Several population-based methods for vQTL analysis are known to be susceptible to bias due to mean effects. In contrast, in principle, the MZ differences design is protected from this problem. Therefore, our study provides independent evidence that mean effects can influence variance.

The main strength of our study is the use of the MZ differences method to investigate the genetics of environmental sensitivity in the largest sample of MZ twins and a wide range of psychological phenotypes from a developmental perspective. The main limitation is the limited statistical power for detecting small genetic effects on variance. The findings should therefore be considered in light of our statistical power. Furthermore, as with all empirical analyses, our inferences depend on specific assumptions that may not hold. First, we took the MZ differences score to reflect genuine phenotypic variability. MZ differences, however, also reflect measurement errors that are difficult to separate from genuine phenotypic differences, and it is unclear whether MZ differences are stable across time. Future projects should investigate this approach with other phenotypes with low measurement errors, such as height, and consider a longitudinal design to assess the stability of these differences. Second, it is challenging to determine which mechanisms explain phenotypic variance. Genetic sensitivity to the environment and epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation, imprinting, chorionicity and skewed X inactivation (for female MZ twins), also contribute to MZ phenotypic differences15,39. Also, the people included in our samples were all of European genetic ancestry since data from twins with DNA in other ancestries were not available in sufficient sample sizes. Our findings may not be generalizable to non-European genetic ancestries. The current study underlines the utility of DNA data from twins and should encourage funding for genetic data collection in multi-ancestry twin cohorts.

In summary, we have identified novel genetic factors associated with phenotypic variability. Our study illustrates the importance of large meta-analyses of genotyped MZ twin samples as a method for discovering and understanding the genetics of phenotypic variance and environmental sensitivity.

Figure  3 provides a flow chart for the current study. The eligibility criteria for inclusion of a study's data in the present study analyses included: (1) cohorts comprising at least 100 pairs of MZ twins; (2) genotyping data for one or both twins; (3) availability of imputed genotype data (for example, 1000 Genomes or Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) data); (4) complete data from both twins for one or more phenotypes (imputation of missing data for incomplete pairs is not recommended); (5) complete covariate data for both twins (that is, age, sex and principal components for the genotyped twin); and (6) samples of European ancestry. Many of the authors of the studies with contributing data are part of the Within Family Consortium.

The analysis plan and pipeline were written, pre-specified and shared with interested cohorts to enable them to conduct GWASs of MZ differences for their available phenotypes, then the results were uploaded to a designated repository (https://github.com/LaurenceHowe/MZTwins-vQTL).

For some participating studies, data were available across the lifespan of participants, thus comprising repeated measures for certain phenotypes. It was therefore possible to explore genetic associations in the context of development by conducting developmentally stratified analyses. The developmental groups were defined as childhood (5–12 years of age), adolescence (13–18 years of age) and adulthood (>18 years of age). GWAS analyses were conducted separately for different cohorts and for each developmental stage if data were available. For anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms and autistic traits, GWAS data were available for children and adults. For ADHD symptoms, GWAS data were available for children and adolescents. For wellbeing and neuroticism, the samples comprised adults only, and for PLEs the samples comprised adolescents only.

Two sets of meta-analyses were then conducted using the GWAS results: a developmentally informed analysis, whereby GWAS results across studies were grouped according to the developmental stage of the sample and meta-analyses were conducted per phenotype (for example, depression child or depression adult); and a developmentally agnostic analysis, whereby a meta-analysis was conducted for each phenotype using the largest sample from each study, regardless of the developmental stage (for example, depression largest or anxiety largest). This ensured maximum power for meta-analysis per phenotype via the largest n value (Supplementary Information section 1.1 provides more details on study design).

The samples analysed in this study included MZ twin pairs from cohort studies or twin registries in Australia and Europe (Supplementary Information Section 1.2 and Supplementary Table 1 provide details of the participating studies). Informed consent and ethical approvals were obtained for all participating cohorts (Supplementary Information). Table 1 shows the total sample sizes per phenotype and across developmental groups.

The MZ differences method requires continuous or categorical non-binary phenotypic data to calculate variance. Therefore, we used mean symptom scores instead of case/control diagnosis and the preference was for continuous measures. Various instruments have been developed for the assessment of psychological phenotypes, as was reflected in the participating studies. The scales differed in the numbers of items included, the types of symptoms assessed and the informant source. If multiple rating scales of a phenotype were available, study authors were asked to select the scale with the most items (tapping most symptom domains). Scales were coded so that higher values represented higher symptom levels. Absolute phenotypic differences were obtained for each MZ pair. Using linear regression, absolute phenotypic differences were corrected for age, sex, ten genetic principal components and any study-specific covariates. The residuals were standardized and rank transformed to be used as the phenotype in the GWASs. A brief description of each phenotype is provided below (Supplementary Information Section 1.1 gives details).

ADHD is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder of attention, activity and impulsivity. Symptoms commonly persist into adulthood. They are typically measured continuously using rating scales, often with separate scales for attention problems and hyperactivity or impulsivity, which can be summed to give a total score of ADHD symptoms.

Anxiety is heterogeneous, with clinical diagnoses comprising specific anxiety disorders (for example, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder or social anxiety disorder) and generalized anxiety disorder. We were interested in generalized anxiety symptoms, usually measured via self-report, and reflected in a total score of anxiety symptoms.

Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder broadly reflecting difficulties in social interaction and verbal communication, as well as repetitive behaviours. Symptoms typically emerge in early childhood, and assessment is carried out via questionnaires and/or interviews. The continuous scores reflect the presence or extent of autism traits rather than a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.

Depression is heterogeneous, with many clinical presentations. A diagnosis requires a distinct change of mood, characterized by sadness or irritability and accompanied by psychophysiological changes, such as disturbances in sleep and appetite or loss of the ability to experience pleasure. The phenotypic scores for depression reflect the presence of any of these symptoms rather than a diagnosis of major depression.

Neuroticism is a personality domain and refers to a lack of emotional stability, stress vulnerability, the tendency to experience intense negative emotions, affects and cognitions, and impulsive behaviours under emotional strain. Neuroticism is considered a risk factor for anxiety and depression.

PLEs include a sub-clinical threshold of symptoms related to psychosis or schizophrenia disorders, such as persecutory ideation or perceptual abnormalities, that are prevalent in the community and non-clinical samples. PLEs are screened using self- or other-report questionnaires or interviews that cover some or all of these domains: paranoia, hallucinations, cognitive disorganization, anhedonia and negative symptoms.

Wellbeing includes both hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing and is typically assessed via questionnaires that index an individual's subjective sense of wellness, such as reporting satisfaction with one's life or being hopeful and optimistic about it. The data from participating studies mainly related to subjective wellbeing (for example, life satisfaction). We preferred to use data for which wellbeing had been measured using a battery of questions. If data were only available from a single question reported on a Likert scale, the response variable was treated as a continuous scale.

Participating studies were required to have genotype data from all 22 autosomes imputed to either the 1000 Genomes reference panel (preferably phase 3) or the HRC. Almost all contributing studies had already participated in a project related to the Within Family Consortium10 and used the same protocol in the automated scripts for genetic data preparation and quality control procedures before GWAS analysis. Minimum quality control requirements at the study level included: filtering SNPs for an imputation quality of >0.3 for HapMap imputed data or >0.5 for 1000 Genomes or HRC data; a call rate of >95%; and a minor allele frequency of >1%. Studies also removed one pair randomly when there were two MZ pairs with a kinship of >0.1. Study-level genotyping and quality control information are included in the Supplementary Data.

We investigated the statistical properties of the MZ differences GWAS method using simulations. Methods using family-based design, such as the MZ differences method, complement population-based vQTL methods in three ways: (1) statistical power; (2) robustness to bias due to additive effects; and (3) providing an alternative identification strategy for triangulation40. To simulate vQTLs, we used the following data-generating model.

where yi,t is the phenotypic value for twin t = {A,B} at MZ pair i = {1,…,n} and α is an intercept term, which is set to 0 for simplicity. β1 is the additive effect of the SNP Gi, which is distributed as

where p is the allele frequency. Note that Gi is the same for both twins in the ith MZ pair. zi is the remaining polygenic risk for the MZ pair, which is normally distributed with a mean of 0 for simplicity, and variance is defined as

where \({{\sigma }^{2}}_{{\rm{g}}}\) is the genetic variance of the trait. The variance heterogeneity term vi,t is modelled as

such that each additional allele at G increases the within-MZ difference by a factor of β2. Finally, ei,t is the independent individual residual variance defined as

where \({\sigma }_{{\rm{v}}}^{2}\) is the variance of vi,t. Therefore, for a pair (A and B) of MZs, the additive genetic factors Gi and zi are fixed, but the within-MZ variability is induced from the vi,t + ei,t terms. We estimated vQTL effects from unrelated individuals (choosing one MZ at random) using the deviation regression model from Marderstein and colleagues41. We estimated vQTL effects using MZs and the following MZ difference model:

where \({\hat{\beta }}_{2}\) is an estimate of the vQTL effect, and ϵi is the residual error from this regression. We investigated the power of each method by generating vQTL effects (β2) calibrated to have 80% statistical power for the deviation regression model method in 500,000 unrelated individuals (with parameters p = 0.3 and β1 = 0). We then estimated how the power of the MZ differences approach varies for these parameters across a range of narrow-sense heritability values \({{\sigma }^{2}}_{{\rm{g}}}={h}^{2}\). We calculated the power for detecting a vQTL at the genome-wide significance level by drawing 1,000 replications and identifying the fraction of simulations that had P < 5 × 10−8.

We estimated the false discovery rate for vQTL in the presence of tagging additive loci, following the approach outlined by Hemani and colleagues11. Briefly, the data-generating model described above is simulated with an additive effect of β1 = 0.1 generated, but the vQTL test is performed at a second locus, G*, that is generated to be in linkage disequilibrium with G. The simulations were then performed with no vQTL effect (β1 = 0), variance of the linkage disequilibrium between G and G* (r2 = 0,…,1), h2 = 0.5 and p = 0.1, and 500 repeats were performed for each parameter combination.

In our primary analysis, we estimated the association between the absolute phenotypic difference between MZ twins (residualized for age, sex and principal components and then standardized and rank transformed) and the genetic marker using linear regression for each SNP, j:

We constructed two further models for sensitivity analyses: model 2, for which the within-twin mean of the phenotype was a covariate in the regression; and model 3, which differed from our primary model by not adjusting for principal components when constructing the phenotype. Model 2 was constructed to examine whether adjusting for the within-twin mean in the GWAS model would significantly impact the SNP associations, which would be the case if the MZ differences largely reflected mean differences. However, this also risks over-correcting, especially for vQTLs, which affect both the mean and variance of a phenotype, as was indicated here by a small-to-moderate (r = ~0.3–0.6) positive correlation between the MZ phenotypic mean and MZ phenotypic differences in our sample (as was previously proposed42). Model 3 was constructed since some participating studies were likely to be very small (fewer than 300 participants). Including ten principal components for all studies might have been overly conservative, leading to an inflation of P values.

We used the sign test to assess whether model 2 and 3 results were similar to those of model 1, as indicated by the correlation between β values, P values and the direction of the effect. The results indicated that models 2 and 3 were not significantly different from model 1 (Supplementary Table 3a–c). Therefore, we considered model 1 to be the most parsimonious, with a lower number of parameters than model 2 but similar results, while also correcting for population stratification confounding. The remaining analyses were therefore conducted using model 1 results only.

Study-level GWAS results (Supplementary Figs. 2–7) were quality controlled using EasyQC (version 23.8)19. Variants with missing estimate (β) values, standard error (s.e.) values, statistical significance (P) values or imputation quality score and SNPs with a minor allele frequency of <0.01 or an imputation quality score of <0.5 were removed. Cptid identifiers (chr:bp:A1:A2) were created and alleles, effects and frequencies were checked in all GWAS results and harmonized according to their respective reference panel (1000 Genomes phase 3 version 5 or the HRC). SNPs with mismatching alleles compared with the reference panel were removed. Indels, monomorphic SNPs and duplicate SNPs that could also be tri-allelic (with the same base pair position but different alleles) were removed, retaining only the SNP with the largest sample. Manhattan and QQ plots were obtained and lambda-median values were inspected for P value inflation (Supplementary Figs. 2–6 and Supplementary Table 2 provide more details).

METAL (2011 release)20 was used to conduct inverse-variance-weighted fixed-effect meta-analysis across studies, per phenotype. First, a meta-analysis was conducted by selecting the GWAS result with the largest sample from each study, regardless of the developmental stage. Another set of GWAS meta-analyses were then conducted in developmentally stratified samples for depression (child and adult), anxiety (child and adult), ADHD (child and adolescent) and autistic traits (child and adult) phenotypes (Supplementary Table 4). Cptid IDs were mapped into rsIDs from the 1000 Genomes phase 3 version 5 European panel. The SNP2GENE function in the FUMA web application (version 1.5.0)21 was used to annotate GWAS SNPs and identify independent significant SNPs (SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with the lead SNP at r2 = 0.1; lead SNPs are those in linkage disequilibrium with any independent significant SNPs with r2 > 0.6; Supplementary Table 5) and to produce regional, QQ and Manhattan plots (Supplementary Figs. 7–11).

MAGMA (version 1.08) in the FUMA web application (version 1.5.2)21 was used to annotate GWAS SNPs and conduct gene-based and gene set analyses. Meta-analysed GWAS results were filtered to include only SNPs available in at least 50% of studies. SNPs were annotated to Ensembl version 92 protein-coding genes for gene-based analyses using default parameters (a SNP-wise model for gene testing). A competitive test was conducted for gene set analyses using default gene sets in FUMA from MsigDB version 7.0, totalling 15,496 gene sets (5,500 curated gene sets and 9,996 Gene Ontology terms). Curated gene sets contained nine data resources, including the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Reactome and BioCarta. Gene Ontology terms comprised three categories: biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. The major histocompatibility complex region was excluded from all annotations (Supplementary Table 5 provides details).

SNP heritability estimates per phenotype were obtained using LDSC (version 1.0.1)22. The European 1000 Genomes linkage disequilibrium scores generated by the authors of LDSC were used, and SNPs for heritability analyses were merged with a set of ~1.2 million high-quality SNPs defined by the authors of LDSC22.

For ADHD symptoms, data were available for children (5–12 years of age) and adolescents (13–18 years of age), whereas for anxiety, depression and autistic traits, data were available for both children and adults (>18 years of age). The stratified analyses included a meta-analysis of GWAS results separately for samples from children, adolescents and adult for these phenotypes, followed by gene-based, gene set and heritability analyses, using the same criteria as the largest non-stratified sample.

We used a two-sample summary data Mendelian randomization to estimate the influence of the genetic liability of psychological phenotypes on their environmental sensitivity. Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants as instrumental variables for the exposure of interest. Three assumptions define instrumental variables: (1) relevance (the instrument must be associated with the exposure); (2) independence (there must be no uncontrolled confounders of the instrument–outcome association); and (3) exclusion restriction (the instruments only affect the outcome via the exposure of interest). We used the summary data from the MZ twins GWAS as an outcome in our Mendelian randomization analyses and investigated whether differences in the mean of each exposure (for example, depression) affect the variance in each psychiatric outcome. The exclusion restriction assumption requires that SNPs only affect the variance in the outcome via their mean effects on the exposure (liability to depression). This assumption would be violated if these variants also affected the outcome via their effects on the variance in depression, independent of their effects on the mean liability to depression. Under such a scenario, our estimates may be biased. Theoretically, this bias could be in either direction. More methodological research would be useful to determine the likelihood and magnitude of these potential biases. We selected 102 independent (linkage disequilibrium = 10,000 kilobases; r2 = 0.001) genetic variants associated with depression in Howard et al.43 as instruments for genetic liability to depression. We harmonized the effects by effect allele, chromosome and position on build hg19. We used the inverse-variance-weighted estimator to estimate the effect of genetic liability to depression on phenotypic variability using the TwoSampleMR package44. The variants were strongly associated with depression and there was minimal overlap between our samples and those used in the GWASs to select variants. Therefore, weak instrument bias is unlikely45. We followed the same procedure for the other phenotypes, but with a different number of SNPs (Supplementary Table 14). Because depression is strongly genetically correlated with anxiety but there are no well-powered GWASs for anxiety, we performed a similar analysis for variance in anxiety but using the 102 variants for depression. Here the main effects for anxiety at each of the 102 variants were obtained from a GWAS using UK Biobank data on self-reported anxiety measures46. Finally, we also tested educational attainment47 and body mass index. GWAS summary statistics for main effects were obtained from OpenGWAS48. We reported this analysis using the STROBE-MR checklist49.

Meta-analysed GWAS summary statistics from the current study are publicly available from OpenGWAS (https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/). Accession codes for the GWAS meta-analyses are as follows: ieu-b-5146 (adolescent) and ieu-b-5147 (child) for MZ twin differences in ADHD symptoms; ieu-b-5148 (largest), ieu-b-5149 (adult) and ieu-b-5150 (child) for MZ twin differences in anxiety symptoms; ieu-b-5151 (largest), ieu-b-5152 (adult) and ieu-b-5153 (child) for MZ twin differences in autistic traits; ieu-b-5154 (largest), ieu-b-5155 (adult) and ieu-b-5156 (child) for MZ twin differences in depression symptoms; ieu-b-5157 for MZ twin differences in neuroticism score; ieu-b-5158 for MZ twin differences in PLEs; and ieu-b-5159 for MZ twin differences in subjective wellbeing. Data from individual studies are not publicly available and are subject to strict access control because the consent given by the participants does not allow for data storage on an individual level in repositories or journals. Access to these data requires specific approval from the relevant data access committees for each cohort. Mapping and allele frequency reference files (all based on National Center for Biotechnology Information build 37) for 1000 Genomes phase 1 version 3, 1000 Genomes phase 3 version 5 and the HRC are available via https://www.uni-regensburg.de/medizin/epidemiologie-praeventivmedizin/genetische-epidemiologie/software/index.html.

Metrics details

Differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into specialized cell types is essential for uncovering cell-type specific molecular mechanisms and interrogating cellular function. Transcription factor screens have enabled efficient production of a few cell types; however, engineering cell types that require complex transcription factor combinations remains challenging. Here, we report an iterative, high-throughput single-cell transcription factor screening method that enables the identification of transcription factor combinations for specialized cell differentiation, which we validated by differentiating human microglia-like cells. We found that the expression of six transcription factors, SPI1, CEBPA, FLI1, MEF2C, CEBPB, and IRF8, is sufficient to differentiate human iPSC into cells with transcriptional and functional similarity to primary human microglia within 4 days. Through this screening method, we also describe a novel computational method allowing the exploration of single-cell RNA sequencing data derived from transcription factor perturbation assays to construct causal gene regulatory networks for future cell fate engineering.

Recent advances and applications of single-cell assays, exemplified by collaborative efforts such as the Human Cell Atlas (HCA)1, have begun to provide a comprehensive view of cell types and cellular states within the human body. Such maps are crucial for understanding tissue heterogeneity during human development and disease. Furthermore, these maps can be mined for promising targets for cell fate engineering, with significant implications for disease modeling, cell therapy, and regenerative medicine. Previously, our lab generated the first comprehensive library of 1732 human transcription factor (TF) isoforms and developed an unbiased screening approach to discover 290 TFs that differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into various functional cell types2. This approach illustrates the power of unbiased screening and led to the discovery of differentiation protocols for several cell types; however, creating a user-specified cell type of interest remains an open area for innovation. To this end, we developed a novel screening platform that enables the identification of TF combinations for differentiating iPSCs into any given cell type using a combination of pooled transfections of a barcoded TF library, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with TF ranking (Fig. 1a), and subsequent validation and characterization. As proof of principle, we sought to determine TF combinations capable of producing microglia in an efficient, rapid, and reproducible fashion and perform a comparative analysis to other differentiation methods.

Research on microglia has long relied on rodents, immortalized cell lines, or the isolation of primary microglia from human brain biopsies. However, many critical transcriptomic and functional differences exist between rodent versus human microglia, making them unsuitable for disease modeling and drug testing3,4,5. Using small molecules to differentiate iPSCs into microglia has greatly improved the availability of human microglia for in vitro studies. However, these protocols involve formulating complex cocktails of small molecules and growth factors, require extended differentiation periods, and sometimes necessitate co-culturing with neurons6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Current TF-based microglia differentiation protocols are largely based on literature search, and thus have been restricted to a limited set of known TFs15,16. In contrast, our method systematically and iteratively tests a wide array of TF candidates to identify an optimal set of TFs that effectively yield a desired cell identity. Additionally, variability in microglia yield and quality across different iPSC lines remains a significant bottleneck. While our previous studies have demonstrated the reproducibility of this approach across three distinct iPSC lines2, we have chosen to use a single founder line for screening and TF identification to enhance efficiency.

In this report, we conduct two sequential iterations of pooled TF screening. Each screening round involves creating a barcoded TF library, performing pooled transfection into iPSCs to induce differentiation, and subsequently analyzing the results with scRNAseq. By ranking TFs based on their ability to drive microglial gene expression, we identify and validate a combination of six TFs. This approach captures previously reported TFs SPI, CEBPA, and IRF8 while also identifying FLI1, MEF2C, and CEBPB. Overexpressing these six TFs in iPSCs enables faster generation of microglia-like cells (TFiMGLs) within four days without compromising cell identity. In addition to shared transcriptional and molecular signatures, we confirm that these cells exhibit key functional features of human primary microglia and other TF-based microglia. Notably, we achieve this differentiation process in standard culture media without the need for additional factors, offering a potential avenue for defining media compositions for further microglia specification in the future. Our barcoding and amplification strategy allows for high-throughput, simultaneous detection of single-cell gene expression and TF barcodes, which provides a template for others seeking to discover TFs for cell fate programming. Finally, we use the TF-perturbation data we generated in a stepwise regression model to construct gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from pooled TF screens. This perturbation-based approach to the construction of regulatory relationships offers unique insight from inferential GRNs, thus providing a computational framework for using high-throughput screening data to better understand regulatory relationships for future cell engineering.

To identify TFs that differentiate iPSCs to microglia, we first surveyed previous literature on microglial development17,18,19,20,21, epigenetic, and transcriptomic patterns3,22,23,24,25, and gene regulatory networks26 and shortlisted 40 TFs for the first pooled TF screen (Supplementary Data S1). To ensure genomic integration of several TF copies we cloned each TF into the pBAN2 vector for integration with PiggyBac transposase and doxycycline (Dox)-inducible expression. Moreover, to distinguish between exogenous and endogenous TF transcripts, we added a 20-nucleotide (nt) barcode between the stop codon and the poly-A sequence of each TF (Supplementary Fig. S1). We then transfected the 40 TF vectors into 600,000 hiPSCs from a healthy donor (PGP1) in duplicates with mass ratio of 4:1 between TF and transposase DNA. We added different amounts of DNA during TF nucleofection and quantified copy numbers of PiggyBac vector genomic integration. We determined that a DNA dose of 5 µg was most consistent for integrating a single digit copy number of at least 5 TFs per cell (Supplementary Fig. S2a, b). After puromycin selection for TF-integrated cells, we induced differentiation by Dox treatment for four days. Fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) of two separate differentiations showed that 0.3-0.5% of the cells expressed the consensus microglial surface proteins CX3CR1, P2RY12, and CD11b (Fig. 1b). In addition, we found that 30% of the cells lost expression of the stem cell marker, TRA-1-60 (Fig. 1c). To pinpoint which of the 40 TF(s) induced microglial gene expression, we sorted all differentiated cells (TRA-1-60 negative) for scRNA-seq. Then, we performed scRNA-seq on 10,000 cells, reasoning that since not all TF combinations are divergent or functionally unique, this quantity would provide sufficient information for initial screen and TF prioritization (Fig. 1a). We performed two independent transfections (Supplementary Fig. S3) and included a 10% spike-in of non-induced hiPSCs in each replicate as an undifferentiated control during scRNA-seq. After observing a consistent differentiation pattern between the two replicates (Fig. 1d), we pooled the data for downstream analysis. We observed expression of microglia genes (ITGAM, P2RY12, CX3CR1, TMEM119, TREM2), separating from a cluster of cells with high expression of POU5F1, a marker for stem cells (Fig. 1d, e). We quantified the expression of exogenous TFs through amplicon sequencing of co-amplified TF and cell barcodes from cDNAs (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. S4). An average of 6.9 TFs (median 6, first quantile 4, third quantile 9) were expressed per cell while 877 (8.5%) out of 10285 single cells lacked TF expression, consistent with the 10% stem cell spike-in (Fig. 1g).

We compared TF expression levels in cells with or without microglial RNA expression and identified the three TFs -SPI1, FLI1, and CEBPA- to most likely induce microglial gene expression (Fig. 1h). SPI1, which encodes PU.1 protein, is a known TF required for microglia development20,21. CEBPA is a known critical regulator for myeloid differentiation27. Although FLI1 has not yet been published for microglial differentiation, it has been reported to interact with TFs RUNX128 and SPI129, which are both indispensable for tissue-resident macrophage development30. We further tested whether these TFs could lead to microglial differentiation individually, or in combination. Individual expression of CEBPA and FLI1 in hiPSCs led to almost complete cell death observed by microscopy, while expression of SPI1 alone was insufficient for differentiation, as only 3% of all cells showed CD11b induction (Supplementary Fig. S5), indicating the need for multiple TFs for microglia differentiation. Thus, we tested various combinations of these TFs. Pooled transfection of CEBPA + FLI1 (“C + F pool”) and CEBPA + SPI1 (“C + S pool”) led to improved microglial marker expression, while CEBPA + FLI1 + SPI1 (“C + F + S pool”) produced the most positive cells, reaching 14% CD11b+, 54% P2RY12+ after four days (Fig. 1i, Supplementary Fig. S6). However, we did not observe expression of CX3CR1, a chemokine receptor important for microglia activation and migration31,32. We hypothesized that this could be due to incomplete integration of different TFs. Therefore, to ensure integration and expression of all three TFs, we generated polycistronic expression cassettes by linking the TFs with 2 A peptides. Previous studies reported that the gene position in the cassette affects their relative expression level, with the first gene being the highest expressed33,34,35. Therefore, we arranged the TFs in different orders (Supplementary Fig. S7). We named the construct by assigning letters based on the order of TFs on the plasmid. For example, SPI1-T2A-FLI1-P2A-CEBPA was named “MG3.1-SFC”. Transfection and induction of the MG3.1-CFS and FCS cassettes both led to almost complete cell death by day 4, consistent with the previous observations of sole CEBPA and FLI1 expression causing cell death. MG3.1-SFC, which had SPI1 positioned at the front, produced cells expressing microglial genes, CD11b+ and P2RY12+ cells (37% and 6% of cells, respectively), but not CX3CR1 (Fig. 1i). The difference in CD11b and P2RY12 expression between cells derived using the MG3.1-SFC cassette and the C + F + S pool is potentially due to different TF dosages. While individual cells within the C + F + S pool may have expressed variable dosage combinations of the three TFs, MG3.1-SFC likely induced a fixed dosage ratio for all cells. Critically, the lack of CX3CR1 expression and the low percentage of CD11b- and P2RY12-positive cells from all 3-TF conditions indicated that additional TFs were needed for efficient microglia differentiation from hiPSCs.

To identify TFs to supplement SPI1, FLI1, and CEBPA, we pursued a second iteration of our screen. We used the top three TFs from the first iteration as a baseline and tested the addition of other TFs (3 + X) (Fig. 2a). To determine what TFs should be included in the second pool, we performed bulk RNA-seq analysis of MG3.1-SFC and compared it with published data on human primary microglia (GSE89189, GSE99074)7,22. Based on differential gene expression analysis using DESeq236, we first picked 25 TFs included in the first pool that showed lower expression levels in MG3.1-SFC than primary microglia. We then included six additional TFs that showed significantly higher gene expression in primary microglia. We also included IRF2 and ELF1 since these TFs showed the highest enrichment in downregulated genes in MG3.1-SFC when using Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)37 regulatory target gene sets. Additionally, using CellNet38, a computational tool that can classify bulk transcriptomic data and predict missing gene regulators, we added six more TFs to the pool. Lastly, following a recent single-cell study on fetal microglia development39, we added SPIB, ETS1, and ELK3. In summary, the second TF pool contained a total of 42 TFs (Supplementary Data S2).

To ensure each cell expressed both the SPI1-T2A-FLI1-P2A-CEBPA cassette and additional TFs from the second pool, we cloned the SFC cassette into a bleomycin-resistant vector and the new TF pool into a puromycin-resistant vector (Fig. 2b). We transfected 600,000 PGP1 hiPSCs in duplicates and performed dual-drug selection. After four days of TF expression, we performed the same process of scRNA-seq and TF barcode amplicon sequencing as in the first iteration (Supplementary Fig. S8). As controls, we spiked in 5% undifferentiated hiPSCs and 10% MG3.1-SFC during single-cell encapsulation to mark the differentiation starting point of two iterations. We applied this approach to two independent pools of cells.

When we analyzed TF barcodes in this experiment, we observed two clusters of cells on UMAP that corresponded to (1) hiPSCs (POU5F1 positive, no TF barcode) and (2) MG3.1-SFC along with other cells expressing additional TFs (Fig. 2c, d). Upon counting TF barcodes, we observed that out of the total 8051 single cells from two independent transfections, 284 (3.5%) cells had no TF barcode, and 613 (7.6%) cells had only the barcode for MG3.1-SFC. On average each cell expressed five TFs (median 4, first quantile 3, third quantile 7) (Fig. 2e, f, Supplementary Fig. S9), with most cells (88.9%) expressing the SFC cassette plus at least one other TF.

To determine which of the new TFs lead to improved microglia differentiation, we analyzed their effects on microglial gene expression. We were especially interested in increasing the expression of CX3CR1, which was not expressed in MG3.1-SFC. We observed significantly higher (p < 0.01) number of MEF2C and KLF6 barcode in cells expressing CX3CR1 (Fig. 2g), suggesting their ability to induce CX3CR1 expression. We also noted that MEF2C was also present in the first screening but failed to reach significance for upregulating CX3CR1, indicating that the use of the SFC cassette as baseline enabled other influential TFs to be found. MEF2C and BHLHE41 also reached high ranking for TMEM119 (Fig. 2g). The SFC cassette ranked at the top for inducing ITGAM and P2RY12 expression, which is expected from the results of the first iteration. In this round of screening, CEBPB and IRF8 emerged as high-potential TFs for promoting ITGAM or P2RY12 expression (Fig. 2g). From this second pooled TF screening, the additional TFs of interest found were MEF2C, CEBPB, IRF8, KLF6, and BHLHE41.

To validate that these additional TFs can promote microglial gene expression, we individually expressed them in addition to SFC (SFC + 1). When compared with MG3.1-SFC, SFC + CEBPB increased the percentage of CD11b+ cells from 37% to 98% (Fig. 2h) but led to more cell death at day 4. SFC + MEF2C and SFC + IRF8 increased P2RY12 expression from 6% to 45% (Fig. 2h). Notably, SFC + MEF2C and SFC + KLF6 increased CX3CR1+ cells from 0% to 20% and 2% respectively (Fig. 2h). These results corresponded well with the predictions from single-cell TF barcode analysis, indicating the validity of using pooled TF screening for inferring causality between TF and target gene expression.

To test if microglia differentiation could be further promoted by delivering more TFs to each cell, we chose the three TFs from the SFC + 1 experiment that led to the highest increase in percentage of microglial gene-expressing cells, CEBPB, IRF8, and MEF2C, to add to the SFC set. We combined MEF2C, CEBPB and IRF8 into polycistronic cassettes. Because MEF2C demonstrated the ability to induce both CX3CR1 and P2RY12, we put it in the first place and varied the position of CEBPB and IRF8, producing two cassettes: MIC and MCI (Fig. 2i). We also varied the position of FLI1 and CEBPA in the first construct to produce SFC and SCF, keeping SPI1 in the front to avoid excessive cell death during differentiation. We tested all four combinations of the two 3-TF cassettes (SFC-MIC, SFC-MCI, SCF-MIC, SCF-MCI) for their ability to induce microglia differentiation (Fig. 2i). Encouragingly, all 6-TF cocktails produced cell pools with increased expression of microglial proteins when compared with MG3.1-SFC (Fig. 2j). We observed that the most effective combination was MG6.4-SCF-MCI, resulting in 66% CD11b+, 93% P2RY12+ and 16% CX3CR1+ cells at day 4, compared with 37%, 6%, and 0% respectively for MG3.1-SFC, the baseline of the second iteration. These results highlighted the value of the second iteration and demonstrated the utility of iterative TF screening for cell fate engineering. We define cells differentiated using MG6.4-SCF-MCI Transcription Factor-induced MicroGlial-Like cells, or TFiMGLs.

To determine the differentiation dynamics of TFiMGLs, we performed bulk RNA-seq analysis of the cells on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 post TF induction. We observed a rapid induction of all six TFs accompanied by a quick downregulation of POU5F1 on day 1 (Fig. 3a). TF induction reached a plateau on day 2, aligning with the sustained upregulation of microglial genes from that point onward. (Fig. 3b). Similarly, principal component analysis (PCA) showed rapid differentiation on day 1 and 2, followed by a gradual deceleration from day 3 to day 6 (Fig. 3c). Moreover, we assessed how accurately the TFiMGLs transcriptome recapitulates that of human microglia, by comparing TFiMGLs bulk-RNA-seq data to previously published bulk RNA-seq data from human primary microglia, iPSC-derived microglia (GSE89189, GSE99074) and TF-based microglia differentiation protocols3,7,15,16,22. To minimize potential batch effects that might hinder meaningful comparison between datasets before downstream analysis, we aligned all raw FASTQ files to the same reference genome and applied a negative binomial regression-based batch effect correction method, ComBat-seq40. The PCA shows that the TFiMGLs transcriptomes from days 2–6 are more similar to primary microglia from various sources than to either iPSCs or hematopoietic progenitors (HPCs), suggesting successful microglial fate induction (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. S10a). Additionally, we observed that TFiMGLs were distinct from monocytes or dendritic cells, two related cell types from the myeloid lineage. Importantly, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)41 on TFiMGLs versus iPSCs using two microglial gene collections from the MSigDB database derived from human brain scRNA-seq (M40168; M39077), revealed significant enrichment scores with both gene collections (M40168: score = 0.72, p-value = 9.01e−10, gene set size = 313; M39077: score = 0.66, p-value = 9.01e−10, gene set size = 391), demonstrating successful derivation of microglia-like cells (Fig. 3e). To further investigate transcriptomic similarity of TFiMGLs to primary microglia, we assessed gene clustering after adding a previously published collection of 881 microglia-enriched genes3. The transcriptomes of day-1 TFiMGLs clustered closer to iPSCs while from day-2 onwards the upregulation of key microglial genes resulted in closer clustering with primary microglia, distinct from monocytes or dendritic cells (Supplementary Fig. S10b). These results demonstrate that induction of SPI1, CEBPA, FLI1, MEF2C, CEBPB, and IRF8 in iPSCs for 2 days is sufficient to obtain cells with a transcriptional profile characteristic of microglia.

Further survival and maturation of TFiMGLs might require adapting the culture media composition. Thus, we conducted a time course study to assess transcriptional profiles of TFiMGLs under two different cell culture conditions. In the first condition, TFiMGLs were induced following the conditions of the TF screen—in short, cells were continuously cultured in mTeSR Plus (+MT) media supplemented with Dox for 6 days. Whereas in the second condition, mTeSR Plus media was switched on day 2 to commercially available microglia-specific media (+MG) supplemented with Dox until day 6. Cells grown in both conditions were collected at days 2, 4, and 6 post induction for scRNA-seq, allowing us to explore the impact of the media compositions on TFiMGL development. Visualizing TFiMGLs gene expression patterns using UMAP revealed two distinct clusters. By color coding cells based on the sample condition, we observed that TFiMGLs at 2 days post induction (D2) localized to a single cluster, whereas all other conditions localized to the second cluster (Fig. 4a). TFiMGLs at 4- or 6-days post induction grown in either +MG or +MT did not show a discrete separation on the second cluster suggesting that media composition has limited effects on RNA expression patterns at such early induction time points. In addition, plotting a correlation matrix of scRNA-seq data revealed a considerably high correlation between D4 and D6 despite culturing in different media (Supplementary Fig. S11a). We compared differentially expressed genes (log2 fold change ≥ 2, p value ≤ 0.05) from each TFiMGL sample versus all other samples and used the Enrichr search engine42,43 to query annotated cell-type gene sets from other RNA-seq or scRNA-seq databases (Fig. 4b, c, Supplementary Data S3–5). Importantly, all TFiMGL samples revealed microglia as the top significantly enriched cell type using the scRNA-seq reference databases Descartes44 and Cell Marker Augmented45, suggesting that these specific media compositions cannot modify TFiMGL identity between days 2 to 6 post induction. Since P2RY12 and CX3CR1 are consensus microglial markers, we further sub-sampled P2YR12 or CX3CR1 positive cells from our scRNA-seq data to determine the proportion of cells expressing these markers and the identity of those cells. Interestingly, we observed an increase in both marker's expressions from D2 to D4 post induction; however, this increase was only maintained until D6 on the +MT condition while the +MG condition reverted to levels comparable to D2 (Fig. 4d, g). When tracing both sub-sampled populations back onto UMAP space, we observed that the P2RY12+ population was evenly dispersed in both clusters, whereas the CX3CR1+ population was slightly more biased towards the D4 and D6 cluster (Fig. 4e, h). We performed gene enrichment analysis for each sub-sampled population using Descartes as a reference dataset which revealed that both sub-sampled populations displayed a significant microglial cell type enrichment from various brain regions (Fig. 4f, i, Supplementary Data S6–7).

In addition, we curated gene marker lists from previously published studies involving in vitro microglia cultures3,46 as well as mature human microglia47 and determined gene expression overlap of our transcriptomic dataset for each TFiMGL condition and timepoint (Supplementary Data S8). All TFiMGL conditions exhibited high expression of ‘human microglia' genes, including ENTPD148, a purinergic receptor modulating immune responses and inflammation, ELMO149, a key regulator of microglial function, and NEAT150, an immune response and inflammatory process regulator in microglia. However, low expression was observed for other microglial genes, such as GPR34, a receptor mediating microglial chemotaxis and neuroinflammation, ADRB2, an immune response regulator via adrenergic signaling, and CSF1R, a receptor critical for microglial survival, differentiation, and proliferation. This might suggest conversion to microglia of different activation stages or subtypes of microglia (Fig. 4j). Different timepoints and media conditions had moderate effects on expression of B2M and HLA-B but didn't change gene expression patterns drastically. To further validate microglia diversity, we identified and visualized collective gene expression of previously reported, defined microglia signatures (Supplementary Data S9) within our scRNA-seq data set (Fig. 4k–m). The cluster comprising the day 2 TFiMGL subpopulation showed enriched gene expression signatures associated with proliferating microglia (Fig. 4k), while neural associated microglia gene signatures were spread throughout the differentiation time points and media conditions (Fig. 4l). Notably, immune associated microglia gene expression patterns are mostly found in TFiMGLs at days 4 and 6 cultured with mTeSR1 media (Fig. 4m). Overall, TFiMGLs show clear microglia identity and display a variety of different microglia signatures depending on maturation and irrespective of media composition.

Since TFiMGL transcriptomes on day 4 displayed mature microglia identity, we chose this timepoint for functional characterization of TFiMGLs. Immunofluorescence analysis of TFiMGLs after Dox induction showed the loss of pluripotency marker OCT4 and expression of key microglial proteins: CD11b, P2RY12, and CX3CR1 (Fig. 5a). Additional brightfield microscopy analysis of TFiMGLs confirmed rapid morphological change from day 1 to day 6 (Supplementary Fig. S12). Importantly, TFiMGLs demonstrated reproducible differentiation between replicates, with 53.9 ± 0.57% (SD, n = 3) CD11b+, 93.1 ± 0.50% (SD, n = 3) P2RY12+ and 14.8 ± 0.68% (SD, n = 3) CX3CR1+ cells (Fig. 5b). Since microglia respond to signals associated with brain infection and inflammation in vivo, we assessed the ability of TFiMGLs to respond to various stimuli. Specifically, we tested their response to interferon gamma (IFNγ), beta amyloid (Aβ), and TDP-43. IFNγ, secreted by T lymphocytes, is a known microglial activator51. Aβ has been shown to elicit microglial response in the context of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology52, while TDP-43 aggregation, a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathology, has also been shown to activate microglia53. To investigate how TFiMGLs respond to IFNγ, fibrillar Aβ (fAβ), and TDP-43, we treated TFiMGLs in triplicates with each of the three molecules for 24 h and harvested cells for RNA-seq. PCA analysis revealed transcriptomic changes in the IFNγ and TDP-43 treated group, while the fAβ-treated group showed minimal differences (Fig. 5c, Supplementary Fig. S13). We confirmed fAβ formation by conducting an in vitro amyloid fibrillation experiment that showed the Aβ peptide could form fibrils after 1 h of incubation (Supplementary Fig. S14). Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes from the IFNγ treated group included “response to virus” and “response to bacterium” (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Fig. S15), corresponding to the role of IFNγ production as a response to infection. Top upregulated genes by IFNγ included CXCL10, CXCL11, IRF1 and IL18BP (Supplementary Fig. S15), aligning with the IFNγ response genes revealed by an independent single-cell level human-derived macrophage stimulation study54. For the TDP-43 treated cells, top differentially regulated pathways included “myeloid leukocyte mediated immunity” and “myeloid cell activation involved in immune response” (Fig. 5e, Supplementary Fig. S16), demonstrating that TFiMGLs were activated by the TDP-43 treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that TFiMGLs exhibited microglia-like responses to infection and ALS-related TDP-43 aggregation.

Another key role of microglia is their ability to respond to signals from degenerating or injured neurons and to subsequently phagocytose them7. To assess this phagocytic activity, we incubated TFiMGLs with pHrodo green labeled S. aureus particles for 0.5, 2, and 4 h in triplicate, and performed flow cytometry and microscopy. While 0.5-h incubation showed minimal phagocytic activity, nearly all cells were positive for pHrodo green at 2 h with fluorescence intensity reaching its peak at 4 h (Fig. 5f, Supplementary Video S1-2). Additionally, co-staining with microglial surface proteins CD11b, P2RY12, and CX3CR1 confirmed the intracellular localization of pHrodo green labeled particles (Fig. 5g). Injured neurons release adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and stimulate microglial responses55,56. To verify ADP response capabilities, we incubated TFiMGLs with the calcium indicator Fluo-4 AM and then stimulated them with ADP containing media. We imaged the cells at a three-second interval and observed a rapid increase in calcium signal following ADP exposure, suggesting that TFiMGLs are responsive to ADP stimulation (Fig. 5h–j; Supplementary Video S3).

An important area of continuing progress in cell fate engineering is the derivation of a complete knowledge map for accurately predicting TF expression levels along with their respective downstream gene expression signatures. Currently, insight on this subject has been gained by leveraging computational methods for inferring TF-gene regulatory network (GRN)57,58 and databases based on TF-binding sites59,60, TF-gene co-expression61,62, and protein-protein interaction63,64. However, determining causal TF-gene regulatory relationships would require direct TF perturbations with downstream transcriptomics, and to do this at an omics scale requires the scaling of classic single-gene perturbation methods to a high-throughput one. In this context, the barcoding and amplification strategy presented in this study enables the readout of single-cell gene expression after multiplexed TF perturbation, and the ability to link transcriptomic results with TF barcode quantification of those individual cells. Thus, we utilized TF-perturbation data from the two pooled screens to develop a stepwise regression model to construct gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to better understand TF regulatory relationships for future cell engineering (Fig. 6 and Methods). In our dataset, each TF transgene was represented by two distinct values: counts from barcode amplicon sequencing, and counts from their RNA molecules in scRNA-seq. Although the counts from scRNA-seq might contain reads from endogenous TF expression, the two measurements correlated well for most TFs (Supplementary Fig. S17), the exception being a few TFs with low expression. We reasoned that TFs that had a higher correlation between their barcode and RNA measurements demonstrated higher consistency between experiments, making them more reliable to produce accurate regression results using the two matrices. Thus, by screening TFs with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.3 between both measurements, we identified 18 TFs from the first iteration and 21 TFs from the second for regression analysis. We observed extensive gene expression changes caused by CEBPA and the triple TF cassette MG3.1_SFC expression (Fig. 6a, b), as well as slightly smaller networks from CIITA, SPI1, ERG2, JUN, CEBPB, ZFP36, and BHLHE41 (Fig. 6c–h, Supplementary Fig. S18). Among the 672 edges, we observed 76% of them to be positive regulations. Some TFs (CIITA, SPI1, JUN) only showed positive edges in current thresholding conditions (Abs(coefficient) >0.1 & −log10(p-value) >20), indicating they were mostly activating other genes. Other TFs (CEBPB, ZFP36, BHLHE41) showed negative edges, indicating their repressive roles. We also observed several genes simultaneously connected with more than one TF (Supplementary Fig. S19). For example, RAB13, a membrane trafficking regulator, was upregulated by both CEBPA and CEBPB; HMGA1, a master regulator of chromatin structure, was downregulated by both BHLHE41 and CEBPA; FLNC, an actin crosslinking protein, was upregulated by JUN while downregulated by CEBPA. There are many more regulatory relationships we listed in detail from these two pooled screens (Supplementary Data S10, 11). Although we have created a firm foundation, with the aid of larger perturbation libraries, higher-throughput scRNA-seq, and more scalable regression analysis methods, it should be possible to build a complete knowledge map of causal TF-gene regulatory relationships in the near future, greatly facilitating cell fate engineering efforts.

The width of edges is correlated with coefficient values, the larger the value the wider the edge. A red edge means upregulation while a blue edge means downregulation. Edges were selected with these criteria: Abs(coefficient) >0.1 and −log10(p-value) >20. F-test was used to determine if any of the independent variables were significant in the regression model. a Global network for the first pooled screen. b Global network for the second pooled screen.

The ability to obtain highly specialized cell types that are not routinely accessible through biopsies is essential to understanding basic cellular mechanisms, molecular disease drivers, and therapeutics development. While engineered expression of transcription factors (TFs) identified through TF screens in iPSCs can rapidly and efficiently produce some cell types, the generation of other cell types that require complex combinations of TFs has been difficult. Here, we addressed this challenge by combining an iterative genetic library screen in hiPSCs with high-throughput scRNA-seq for cell fate engineering and validated this approach by generating microglia-like cells. We conducted two iterations of our design-screen-validate workflow and discovered that the combination of TFs SPI1, CEBPA, FLI1, MEF2C, CEBPB, and IRF8 effectively drives microglia differentiation from hiPSCs within 2 days, significantly reducing the standard 35 days through growth factor-based protocols11. Characterizations of TFiMGLs demonstrated transcriptomic and functional resemblance to primary human microglia. We further uncovered TF-gene regulatory relationships in these pooled screens through genome-wide regression analysis between TF barcode counts and gene expression levels.

During this study, we noted several technological challenges that could be addressed in future studies. Most current TF-based differentiation protocols rely on a one-time induction of TF expression, while lacking the capability for sequential induction. Despite this challenge, current strategies have successfully generated certain cell types, including multiple types of neurons65, endothelial cells2, and the induction of iPSCs themselves66. However, during development in vivo coordinated gene programs are sequentially activated, as observed in time-resolved transcriptomic analysis of developing tissues67. This feature could be re-created by identifying orthogonal induction system with a comparable strength to the doxycycline-inducible system or developing tunable gene circuits. With these tools, it will be possible to test whether sequential TF expression can lead to improved differentiation accuracy. In addition to temporal control of TF expression, the ability to regulate expression levels of individual TFs could also lead to improvements in differentiation. There were two manifestations of this pattern in the current study. In the first case, although CEBPA and FLI1 expressed individually led to cell death, their presence in the SFC cassette enabled cell survival and differentiation. The reduced expression levels of CEBPA and FLI1 and their potential interactions with other TFs could also explain why we were able to observe an extensive GRN for CEBPA on the first pooled screen, which would not be possible due to toxicity in CEBPA-expressing cells. The second case can be observed in the effect that different sequential arrangements of TFs in the polycistronic cassettes led to different levels of downstream microglial protein expression. The effect of TF stoichiometry on differentiation efficiency has also been observed for cardiac myocyte programming68 and was shown to influence iPSC reprogramming34,35. While the positional effects in a polycistronic cassette offer one way to explore the stoichiometry space, the development of new titratable promoters allowing the turning of individual genes could be an important tool for cell fate engineering.

Establishing a specialized cell fate from stem cells requires orchestrated interactions between many genes. To increase the likelihood of priming iPSCs to the targeted microglia cell fate, we designed the pooled screen to have multiple TFs delivered to each cell by transposase. Because the combinatorial space of the TFome can quickly become astronomical and cost-prohibitive, especially when scRNA-seq is involved, we decided to prioritize a small subset of the TFome based on existing literature evidence for microglia development and differentiation. It is impossible to pre-determine how many TFs will be necessary to achieve effective differentiation. While having a large number (>10) of TFs overexpressed in a single stem cell could increase the chance of having the correct combination, it also raises the risk of biological noise, making the screening results less interpretable. With this in mind, we aimed for approximately five TFs per cell and adopted an iterative screening strategy. Although using fewer TFs per cell reduces the potential to discover the complete set of necessary TFs in a single screen, this issue can be mitigated by identifying top TFs from each round of screening and keeping them constant in subsequent screen iterations. We believe this stepwise approach gives us a better chance of disentangling the complex gene regulatory network needed for establishing a specific cell fate.

Microglia are resident immune cells of the brain which originate from erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) in the yolk sac17,69. They play important and diverse roles in brain development and maintaining homeostasis18,19,70,71,72. Recent studies have demonstrated the link between neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD)73,74, and microglia have been shown to be an important cell type in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases75,76,77,78. However, functional studies to define microglia-targeting therapeutics have been greatly hindered by the limited availability of human brain biopsies79,80. This supply issue cannot be simply mitigated by using murine models given that interspecies differences limit the transferability of knowledge4,5. Various research groups have developed human microglia-like cells from iPSCs in efforts to fill this gap. Several studies have accomplished this goal through a process of embryoid body formation, growth factor treatment, and, in some cases, co-culturing with neurons6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. These protocols draw inspiration from the natural developmental stages of microglia and have timelines ranging from 30–74 days. More recently, a study showed microglia differentiation through forced expression of both SPI1 and CEBPA16. Comparison of RNAseq datasets showed similarities between SPI1/CEBPA16, PU.1/MAFB/CEBPα/CEBPβ/IRF5/IRF815 induced iPSCs and TFiMGLs at early time points, however at later time points TFiMGLs showed closer similarity to microglia derived through longer iPSC differentiation processes involving hematopoiesis and subsequent microglia differentiation7. This suggests that through the induction of additional TFs, we leveraged complex TF-gene regulatory relationships which altered the overall developmental trajectory of TFiMGLs. In the future, the identity of TFiMGLs could be more precisely defined by optimizing culture conditions and co-culturing with neural cells or organoids. This approach would enhance the transcriptional cascades triggered by TF overexpression, enabling a deeper investigation into their similarity to in vivo microglia under various conditions. Differentiating human cell types from stem cells is essential for basic research and therapeutics development, especially when the desired cell types are not easily obtainable from accessible human tissues. Advances in the understanding of developmental biology have fueled the discovery and application of protocols to differentiate specific cell types from iPSCs. Some of this work has been translated into treatment strategies that are now being investigated with clinical trials for devastating diseases like age-related macular degeneration81 and type 1 diabetes82. Differentiated iPSCs have now also become routinely used in laboratories for studying disease mechanisms and testing drugs83. Recent global efforts on building single-cell atlases of cellular development have expanded the knowledge of human development and diseases and also present a key resource for cell fate engineering. Combining technological advancements in genetic library construction with high-throughput screening and sequencing technologies, this work lays the groundwork for the developmental biology field to engineer cell fates in a more systematic and multiplexed fashion.

All TFs used in this study were obtained from the TFome collection2 in pDONR format. For expression in hiPSCs, a PiggyBac integrating Dox-inducible vector pBAN2 was used. To create barcoded pBAN expression vector (pBAN-BC), the original pBAN was digested with AgeI and KpnI, followed by ligation of a gBlock (IDT DNA) containing the same excised piece with an additional 20-bp random barcode. After bacteria transformation, individual colonies were expanded and extracted for plasmid DNA. Gateway cloning was used to transfer each TF from pDONR to pBAN-BC vector. Barcode sequence for each TF was confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

The human male iPSC line GM23338 was obtained from Coriell. No commonly misidentified cell lines were used in the study. hiPSCs were cultured in mTeSR Plus media (Stemcell Technologies, 100-0276) on multi-well plates coated with Matrigel (Corning, 354277) or Cultrex (Bio-Techne Corporation, 3434-005-02). For passaging, cells were dissociated with TrypLE Express (Life Technologies, 12604013) and seeded into freshly coated plates and media containing 10 µM Y-27632 ROCK inhibitor (Millipore, 688001) for 24 h. Daily media change was performed until cells were ready for another passaging or downstream experiments.

TF (pBAN-TF-BC) and Super PiggyBac (SPB) Transposase (System Biosciences, PB210PA-1) expression vectors were mixed at a mass ratio of 4:1 and transfected into hiPSCs using P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit L (Lonza, V4XP-3024) on a 4D-Nucleofector X Unit (Lonza, AAF-1002X) following the manufacturer's instructions. For the two pooled TF screenings, 600,000 cells were transfected with 5 µg of DNA and seeded into one well of a 6-well plate. For individual TF combinations, 120,000 cells were transfected with 2.5 µg of DNA and seeded into one well of a 12-well plate. For PiggyBac dose curve of copy number quantification using qPCR, 600,000 cells were nucleofected with vectors containing puromycin- and bleomycin-resistance genes at total DNA concentrations of 1.25 µg, 2.5 µg, 5 µg, and 10 µg and SPB transposase was mixed at a mass ration of 4:1. Nucleofected cells were seeded into one well of a 6-well plate. Program CB150 was used for the nucleofections. 48 h after nucleofection, 1 µg/mL of puromycin (Gibco, A1113803) or 50 µg/mL of zeocin (Gibco, R25001) was added to the culture for the selection of TF-integrated cells. Cells were passaged again when reaching 80% confluency. For induction of TF expression, cells were seeded into mTeSR Plus media containing 0.5 µg/mL doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich, D3072) and 10 µM Y-27632 ROCK inhibitor and were changed into media only containing doxycycline after 24 h.

iPSCs integrated with vectors containing Puromycin- and Bleomycin-resistance genes at concentrations of 1.25 µg, 2.5 µg, 5 µg, and 10 µg or with 5 µg of DNA of MG6.4-SCF-MCI TFs were harvested by first washing with PBS (- calcium, - magnesium) and then dissociating them into single cell suspensions with Accutase (StemCell Technologies, 07920) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cultures were then quenched with DMEM/F12 (Gibco, 11320033) and subsequently centrifuged at 300g for 3 min. The cell pellet was rinsed with PBS (- calcium, - magnesium), centrifuged at 300g for 3 min and flash frozen at −110 °C for PiggyBac copy number qPCR quantification.

gDNA extraction was conducted using the PiggyBac Copy Number qPCR Kit (System Biosciences, PBC100A-1) following the manufacturer's protocol. The qPCR reaction mixes comprised 1x DyNAmo ColorFlash SYBR Green qPCR Mix (Thermo Scientific, F-416L), 840 nM primers, and 1 µL of gDNA (10-50 ng). Primers targeting rtTA, bleomycin resistance gene, and puromycin resistance gene were employed to amplify PiggyBac integrations, while UCR1 primers (System Biosciences) were utilized for the normalization to the cell genome copies. Quantitative PCR was performed using the QuantStudio 7 Flex system (Applied Biosystems) with thermocycling settings recommended by the PiggyBac Copy Number qPCR Kit. Calculations to determine integration copies were performed in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol.

For cytometry analysis, cells were dissociated with TrypLE Express for 5 min at 37 °C, diluted with twice the volume of Cell Staining Buffer (Biolegend, 420201) and centrifuged at 200 g for 3 min to remove the digesting enzyme. Cells were then incubated with 25 µg/mL of Human Fc Block (BD Biosciences, 564219) diluted in Cell Staining Buffer for 15 min on ice, followed immediately by staining with fluorescently conjugated antibodies or isotype controls at 5 µl per million cells in 100 µl staining volume for 30 min on ice. Antibodies were diluted in Cell Staining Buffer and Human Fc Block was not removed from the mixture. After antibody staining, cells were washed twice with Cell Staining Buffer before being put through 35 µm nylon mesh into a 5 mL round bottom polystyrene tube (Falcon, 352235). Flow cytometry data were acquired on a BD LSRFortessa Cell Analyzer. For cell sorting, the staining protocol was the same except that Cell Staining Buffer was replaced with mTeSR Plus media in order to maintain the best viability of cells. Cell sorting was performed on a BD FACSAria Cell Sorter. Flow cytometry antibodies used in this study were: FITC-TRA-1-60 (BD Biosciences, 560380), BV421-CX3CR1 (Biolegend, 341620), PE-P2RY12 (Biolegend, 392104), APC-CD11b (Biolegend, 101212). Isotype controls used were: BV421- Rat IgG2b (Biolegend, 400640), PE-Mouse IgG2a (Biolegend, 400214), APC- Rat IgG2b (Biolegend, 400612).

scRNA-seq experiments were performed using 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits v3 or v3.1 following the manufacturer's instruction. 5000 single cells were calculated as targeted input for each sample. For the first iteration, 10% of stem cells were spiked in as undifferentiated control. For the second iteration, 5% stem cells and 5% MG3.1-SFC were spiked in as undifferentiated and initial differentiation control. The only modification made to the protocol was at the Sample Index PCR step, where 5 µL of the PCR mix was taken out and mixed with 0.5 µL 1000X SYBR Gold (Invitrogen, S11494) for a qPCR reaction. The optimal amplification cycle was determined as the cycle just before half maximum of the total signal. Final libraries were sequenced on NextSeq 500 or NovaSeq with a goal of at least 30,000 reads per cell.

Because after the cDNA amplification step in the 10x scRNA-seq protocol the amplicons contained cell barcodes, UMIs, and TF barcodes, these cDNAs could be used as the template for further amplification of TF-cell barcodes. Two sequential PCR reactions were performed, each was accompanied by a SYBR Gold spike-in qPCR to determine the optimal cycle number as described in “scRNA-seq library preparation”. For PCR1, NGS10x-F-i7-BC-PCR1F and i5000 were used as primers. A 50 µL PCR1 reaction contains 25 µL Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs, M0494L), 5 µL amplified cDNA, 2.5 µL of both primers at 10 µM stock concentration, and 15 µL nuclease-free water. PCR1 program was initial denaturation, 98 °C, 30 s; 11–13 cycles (qPCR determined) of 98 °C, 10 s, 67 °C, 30 s, 72 °C, 30 s; final extension, 72 °C, 2 min. PCR1 reaction was purified with 1.2X SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter, B23318) following standard protocol. The sample was eluted in 20 µL water. For PCR2, i7000, P5, and P7 were used as primers. A 50 µL PCR2 reaction contains 25 µL Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix, 10 µL PCR1 product, 2.5 µL of all three primers at 10 µM stock concentration, and 7.5 µL nuclease-free water. PCR2 program was initial denaturation, 98 °C, 30 s; 4–5 cycles (qPCR determined) of 98 °C, 10 s, 67 °C, 30 s, 72 °C, 30 s; final extension, 72 °C, 2 min. PCR2 product was purified the same as PCR1. Final libraries were submitted for MiSeq v3 with paired-end reads of 80 cycles from either direction.

For scRNA-seq, raw FASTQ files were aligned to GRCh38 and quantified using Cell Ranger. Detailed information about cell number, read depth and gene detected is visualized in Supplementary Figs. S3 and S8. Seurat was used to perform cell filtering, data normalization, and clustering. The generated Seurat object also contained the single-cell raw expression matrix for all genes. For TF barcode-seq, in the paired-end MiSeq data, one of the read pairs contains the 20 bp TF barcode while the other one contains the 16 bp cell barcode and the 12 bp UMI. By matching the names of the reads within the pair, three sequences were compiled into one table with three columns: TF-BC, cell-BC, UMI. To remove duplicated reads from the same molecule, duplicated rows that have the same value for all three columns were removed. Then the table was counted and reshaped into a frequency table where the row names represent cell and column names represent TF. This table contains the raw counts of each TF barcode in all single cells. Because the TF barcodes were amplified from the cDNA during library preparation, we normalized the TF barcode count with the number of total RNA UMIs detected in each cell, reasoning that cells with more total UMIs were likely to have more reads for TF barcode. The raw gene expression matrix and normalized TF count matrix were used to identify which TF barcodes were likely to induce microglial gene expression. Specifically, the expression of microglial genes was binarized, with any cell had a non-zero expression being 1. Then between the two groups of cells 0 or 1 microglial gene expression, a one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed for all barcoded TFs to determine which TF(s) had a higher expression in cells expressing microglial genes. The TFs were ranked by -log10(p-value).

Cultured cells were dissolved directly with TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15596018) for total RNA purification with Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research, R2050). RNA concentration was quantified with Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q32852). RNA integrity was confirmed by the presence of 18S and 28S bands on a 2% E-Gel EX Agarose Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, G402002). Between 100 ng to 1000 ng total RNA was used as input for mRNA enrichment using NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, E7490), followed by library construction with NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, E7760S) following the manufacturer's instructions. Biopolymers Facility at Harvard Medical School performed library QC and sequencing.

For both in-house generated sample and datasets downloaded from GEO, raw FASTQ files were aligned to GRCh38 and quantified using STAR (version 2.5.2b). Regularized-logarithm (rlog) transformation was applied to the raw counts before visualization using PCA. For analysis where data from multiple sources were involved, ComBat-seq was used for batch correction before PCA. Differential gene expression analysis was conducted with DESeq236. Pathway enrichment and GSEA analysis were performed with clusterProfiler84. Bulk RNA-seq data generated and analyzed in this study have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

TFiMGLs were fully cultured in either stem cell media, mTeSR Plus (MT), or switched to commercially available microglia media (MG) (Stemcell Technologies, 100-0020) from day 2 until day 6. All media were supplemented with 0.5 µg/mL doxycycline for the duration of the experiment. Undifferentiated iPSCs and TFiMGLs at days 2-, 4-, and 6-post induction (both MT and MG media conditions for days 4 and 6) were harvested by first washing with PBS (- calcium, - magnesium) followed by dissociating cultures into single cell suspensions with Accutase (StemCell Technologies, 07920) for 10 min at 37 °C, cultures were then quenched with DMEM/F12 (Gibco, 11320033) and subsequently centrifuged at 300 g for 3 min. The cell pellet was rinsed with PBS (- calcium, - magnesium) and centrifuged again at 300 g for 3 min prior to fixation. Single cell suspensions from each sample were processed using the Parse Biosciences Fixation Kit following the manufacturer's instructions (SB1001) and subsequently stored at −80 °C until all samples of the time course were harvested. Libraries for all samples were prepared using the Parse Whole Transcriptome Mini V1 kit following the manufacturer's instructions (EC-W01010) where an average of 450 bp libraries were generated. Sequencing of libraries was carried out on an Illumina NextSeq 500 High Output v2.5 (300 Cycles) (sequenced at Biopolymers Facility - Harvard Medical School) using a single index (6 bp) and 5% PhiX spike-in as per Parse Biosciences sequencing instructions. Sequenced data was processed using Parse Batch Analysis (version 1.0.9) on the DNAnexus platform to demultiplex into library fastq files and count matrices. A total of 3,121 cells were analyzed where 1,178 cells corresponded to D2 TFiMGLs, 308 cells to D4 + MG, 727 cells to D4 + MT, 438 cells to D6 + MT, and 470 cells to D6 + MT. Processing and analysis of scRNAseq data was carried out using the Python package Scanpy85 (version 1.9.5)—data processing included initial filtering out of cells that had fewer than 200 genes as well as genes found in fewer than 2 cells followed by concatenating all of the samples. Further pre-processing of the data included removing cells with gene counts higher than 7000 in addition to a mitochondrial gene expression higher than 12%. The dataset was then normalized, log transformed and a scaling factor of 10,000 was applied. Downstream analyses (e.g. dimensionality reduction, clustering and plotting of graphs) followed standard procedures as per Scanpy documentation (https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). For differential gene expression analysis of samples, we compared each condition to all other conditions and set a minimum threshold of log2 fold change ≥ 2 and minimum p-value of ≤ 0.05. This generated differently sized lists of genes for each condition (Supplementary Data S3). For consistency, the top 122 genes for all conditions were used and cell type annotations were assessed with EnrichR (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/#libraries) through either the Descartes or Cell Marker Augmented databases. We obtained the top enriched cell marker annotation hits for each database by considering adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 (Supplementary Data S4–5). An expression threshold method was used when we subsetted cells based on the expression of a specific gene of interest (CX3CR1 or P2RY12). This approach involved selecting cells that exhibited expression levels above a predefined threshold of 0.5. The threshold was determined based on the distribution of expression values within the dataset, ensuring that only cells with significant expression of the target gene were included for subsequent analyses. For differential gene expression analysis of the subsetted cluster we used the top 200 genes and input them in the python package Gseapy (version 1.0.5) to analyze GO term pathways in addition to cell type annotation assessment through Descartes cell atlas database (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/#libraries) (Supplementary Data S6-7). For cell type annotation, we used marker gene sets from the following published datasets as references35 (Supplementary Data S8–9). scRNA-seq data generated and analyzed in this study have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

IF experiments were performed in µ-Plate 96 Well Black plate (ibidi, 89626). After media removal, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 15710) in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10010072) for 15 min at room temperature (RT). Cells were rinsed three times with PBS before proceeding to permeabilization or blocking. For staining of Oct-3/4 and PU.1, cells were permeabilized, while not for cell surface proteins' staining. Permeabilization was conducted with 0.25% Triton-X-100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 85111) in 1x PBS for 15 min at RT followed by three rinses with PBS. Cells were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 h at RT. For primary and secondary antibody staining, antibodies were diluted in PBS with 1% BSA and incubated with cells for 1 h at RT. Three 5-min washes with PBS were used to remove excessive antibodies after staining. Cells were directly imaged in a plate on a Nikon Ti2 Eclipse inverted microscope with a Plan Apo Lambda DM 60× (1.4 NA, Ph3) oil objective and an Andor Zyla sCMOS camera. Images were acquired by NIS-Element AR software. All antibodies were used at 1:200 dilution. Primary IF antibodies used in this study were: Oct-3/4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-5279), PU.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PA5-17505), CD11b (BioLegend, 101202), P2RY12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 702516), CX3CR1 (Abcam, ab8021).

Differentiated cells were incubated with 20 µg/mL of pHrodo Green S. aureus BioParticles (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P35382) for 0-4 h in mTeSR Plus media in the presence of 100 µg/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin (Corning, 30-002-CI). After removal of excessive particles with PBS washes, cells were harvested for antibody (CX3CR1, P2RY12, CD11b) staining and flow cytometry analysis as described in the previous section. Remaining stained cells after flow cytometry were transferred into µ-Plate 96 Well Black plate for fluorescence microscopy to confirm the intracellular localization of the particles. This step needs to be conducted swiftly after flow cytometry in order to avoid changes in cellular morphology due to cell death.

Calcium imaging experiment was conducted in standard 12-well cell culture plates. Differentiated cells were incubated with 1 µg/mL Fluo-4 AM calcium indicator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, F23917) in 1 mL of mTeSR Plus media for 30 min in a cell culture incubator. Excessive dye was washed away with two 1 mL media washes. After adding 1 mL of fresh mTeSR Plus, the cells were put on stage in a microscope inside the incubator. Image acquisition started without stimulation for 90 s to determine baseline signal. One image was acquired every 3 s, the fastest possible on the instrument. After 90 s, 1 mL of media containing 150 µM ADP was added to the cells while imaging was continuing. The total length of imaging was 10 min. The fluorescent signal was quantified and plotted using MATLAB.

Aβ fibrillation experiments were performed using SensoLyte Thioflavin T β-Amyloid (1-42) Aggregation Kit (AnaSpec, AS-72214) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The reaction was set up in µ-Plate 96 Well Black plate. Data were acquired on a plate reader with excitation/emission = 440 nm/484 nm at 37 degrees Celsius once every 5 min for 3 h.

Day 4 TFiMGLs were plated at a seeding density of 120k cells per well of a 12-well plate in triplicates for each condition. Cells were incubated for 24 h with either 250 μg/mL Aβ (Anaspec, AS-72214), 20 ng/mL INFγ (Novosbio NBP2-34992) or 2.8 μg/mL TDP-43 (RnD systems, AP-190) added to the culture media. After the incubation, cells were harvested for bulk RNA sequencing as previously described.

The stepwise regression (or stepwise selection) is a regression model that iteratively adds and removes predictors in the predictive model to find the subset of variables in the data set resulting in the best performance, and consequently lowering the perdition error in the model. During the process, the value of the statistical test is used to screen the variables. If the value is less than or equal to 0.05, then the variable enters the regression model, and the selected variable is the independent variable of the regression model. For the construction of the model:

Step 1: Establish \(P\) regression models between the independent variables \({X}_{1},\,{X}_{2},\,{\ldots,X}_{p}\) (\({number}={P}\)) and the dependent variable \(Y\) respectively,

Calculate the statistical value of the F-test with the regression coefficient \({F}_{1}^{(1)}\),…, \({F}_{p}^{(1)}\), and take the maximum value \({F}_{i1}^{(1)}\),

For a given significance level \(\alpha\), the threshold value is \({F}^{1}\). If \({F}_{i1}^{(1)}\, > \,{F}^{1}\), then \({X}_{i1}\) will be included in the regression model and recorded as the set of selected variable indicators as \({I}_{1}\).

Step 2: Establish a binary regression model of the dependent variable \(Y\) and the independent variable subset \(\{{X}_{i1},\ldots,{X}_{1}\}\), \(\{{X}_{i1},\ldots,{X}_{i1-1}\}\), \(\{{X}_{i1},\ldots,{X}_{i1+1}\}\), calculate the statistical value of the F-test with the regression coefficient \({F}_{k}^{(2)}\) and take the maximum value \({F}_{i2}^{(2)}\),

For a given significance level \(\alpha\), record the corresponding critical value as \({F}^{(2)}\). If \({F}_{i2}^{\left(2\right)}\, > \,{F}^{(2)}\), then the variable is introduced into the regression model. Otherwise, the variable introduction process is terminated.

Step 3: Repeat Step 2 with the subset of variables \(\{{X}_{i1},\,{X}_{i2},{X}_{k}\}\). This step is repeated by selecting an independent variable that is not introduced into the regression model until the test does not introduce any variables.

Both p-values and coefficients in the regression analysis work together to represent relationships in the model about the significant factors. The coefficients describe the mathematical relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable. The p-values for the coefficients indicate whether these relationships are statistically significant. We selected the 250 TF-gene combinations from the first pooled screen and 422 in the second with the criteria Abs(coefficient) >0.1 & -log10(p-value) >20, then visualized them using Cytoscape version 3.886. Briefly, source and target TF node interactions were visualized using a node degree sorting scheme. Edge directionality was represented by color (red for positive, blue for negative) and the edge weight was also represented by width.

Sample sizes were determined by existing studies in the field to enable statistical analyses and reproducibility. For each pooled screen, 600,000 cells were transfected in order to obtain sufficient numbers of cells post-purification and scRNA-seq processing. We performed scRNA-seq on 10,000 cells reasoning that since not all TF combinations are divergent or functionally unique, this quantity would provide sufficient information for initial screen and TF prioritization. No data was excluded from the relevant analyses. Both pooled screens were performed in duplicate, TFiMGL characterizations were performed in triplicate, PiggyBac dose curve copy number quantification was performed in replicate. TF-induced iPSC differentiation has demonstrated high reproducibility across experiments and studies. Randomization was not utilized in this study since the cell products were derived from the same cell source. The Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

Metrics details

Regenerating limbs retain their proximodistal (PD) positional identity following amputation. This positional identity is genetically encoded by PD patterning genes that instruct blastema cells to regenerate the appropriate PD limb segment. Retinoic acid (RA) is known to specify proximal limb identity, but how RA signaling levels are established in the blastema is unknown. Here, we show that RA breakdown via CYP26B1 is essential for determining RA signaling levels within blastemas. CYP26B1 inhibition molecularly reprograms distal blastemas into a more proximal identity, phenocopying the effects of administering excess RA. We identify Shox as an RA-responsive gene that is differentially expressed between proximally and distally amputated limbs. Ablation of Shox results in shortened limbs with proximal skeletal elements that fail to initiate endochondral ossification. These results suggest that PD positional identity is determined by RA degradation and RA-responsive genes that regulate PD skeletal element formation during limb regeneration.

Tissue regeneration requires a complex cellular choreography that results in restoration of missing structures. Salamander limb regeneration is no exception, where mesenchymal cells, including dermal fibroblasts and periskeletal cells, dedifferentiate into a more embryonic-like state and migrate to the tip of the amputated limb to form a blastema1,2. Mesenchymal cells within the blastema contain positional information which coordinates proximodistal (PD) pattern reestablishment in the regenerating limb, enabling autopod-forming blastema cells to distinguish themselves from stylopod-forming blastema cells3,4. It has been proposed that continuous values of positional information exist along the PD axis and that thresholds of these values specify limb segments5,6. These segments are genetically established by combinations of homeobox genes including Hox and Meis genes7,8,9, and each limb segment contains a unique epigenetic profile around these homeobox genes10. However, a mechanistic explanation for how continuous values of positional information are established and differentially interpreted by limb segments during limb regeneration is lacking.

Retinoic acid (RA) is a small, pleiotropic molecule that is pervasively involved during vertebrate morphogenesis, including initiating and patterning the developing limb. The prevailing model suggests that RA is synthesized in the lateral plate mesoderm during amniote limb development and diffuses into the limb bud to specify proximal limb identity through activation of Meis genes11,12,13,14,15. An intrinsically timed, antagonizing gradient of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) emanating from the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) then creates a zone of distal identity marked by Hoxa13 expression15,16,17. This activates CYP26B1, which eliminates RA from the distal limb cells and creates a gradient of RA that patterns the developing limb PD axis18. Perturbing the establishment of this gradient often results in PD patterning defects18,19. Our understanding of the role of RA in urodele limb development is not as comprehensive as in amniotes, but some aspects have been elucidated. Similar to amniotes, a gradient of active RA signaling exists along the developing urodele PD axis20 and disruption results in abnormal skeletal morphologies along the PD axis21,22,23.

As in limb development, RA concentration is thought to differentiate the positional identity of upper limb blastemas from lower limb blastemas, thereby ensuring regeneration of the appropriate PD limb structures from disparate amputation planes. RA synthesis occurs endogenously within the blastema in response to injury24,25, and RA signaling is approximately 3.5 times higher in proximal blastemas (PBs) compared to distal blastemas (DBs)26. These endogenous levels of RA are necessary for proper regeneration23,27,28. Furthermore, administering RA to DBs reprograms blastema cells to a proximal identity, resulting in regeneration of more proximal structures in a concentration-dependent manner29,30. This reprogramming is associated with downregulation of distal limb patterning genes like Hoxa13 and upregulation of proximal limb patterning genes like Meis1 and Meis29,22. In agreement with this, perturbing Meis1 and Meis2 in RA treated DBs partially blocks limb duplication31. These studies collectively point to a model whereby heightened RA signaling in PBs specifies proximal positional identity through activation of proximal patterning genes and repression of distal patterning genes. Despite strong evidence that RA regulates positional identity along the regenerating PD axis, the differences in RA signaling levels between PBs and DBs are not fully understood.

In this work, we examine the spatiotemporal expression of limb patterning genes in PBs and DBs and compare it to expression of genes related to RA synthesis, degradation, and signaling. We observed that Cyp26b1 was more highly expressed in mesenchymal cells of DBs than PBs, suggesting that differences in RA signaling levels between PBs and DBs are due to RA degradation. Pharmacological inhibition of CYP26B1 in DBs increases RA signaling and results in concentration-dependent duplications of proximal limb segments. These duplications occur by repressing distal limb patterning genes and activating proximal limb patterning genes. Two such genes, Shox and Shox2, are both RA-responsive and differentially expressed in PBs and DBs. Disruption of Shox yields phenotypically normal autopods but shortened stylopods and zeugopods that fail to initiate endochondral ossification. Moreover, we show that Shox is not required for limb regeneration but is crucial for endochondral ossification of stylopodial and zeugopodial skeletal elements during regeneration. Our results collectively suggest that RA breakdown via CYP26B1 is required for establishing positional identity along the regenerating PD axis, enabling the activation of genes such as Shox that confer proximal limb positional identity.

To explore how patterning genes regulate RA signaling in PBs and DBs, we examined the expression of known RA-responsive homeobox genes, including Meis1 and Meis215,31. We assessed the expression of these genes in limbs amputated at the upper stylopod (US), lower stylopod (LS), upper zeugopod (UZ), and autopod levels at 10 DPA using qRT-PCR and found that Meis1 and Meis2 expression decreases in progressively distal amputations (Fig. 1A–C). We next reanalyzed blastema scRNA-seq data from proximally amputated limbs (Fig. S1) to identify cell types expressing Meis1 and Meis232, and found Meis1 expression in mesenchymal and epithelial cells, while Meis2 was undetected (Fig. S2A, B).

We then visualized Meis1 and Meis2 in DBs at 7, 10, and 14 DPA and found Meis1 was primarily expressed in the epithelium while Meis2 was lowly expressed in the mesenchyme and epithelium (Fig. 1D, E, Figs. S2C, D and S3). Similarly, PBs at 7 DPA exhibited low mesenchymal Meis1 and Meis2 expression (Fig. S2C). At 10 DPA, Meis1 was significantly higher in the mesenchyme of PBs, and Meis2 was elevated in PBs but was generally lowly expressed (Fig. 1D, E, Fig. S4). By 14 DPA, Meis1 was significantly higher in PBs and localized to the proximal-most mesenchyme cells, creating a distal zone devoid of Meis1 expression (Fig. 1D–F, Fig. S5). A similar Meis1 expression pattern was observed during axolotl (Figs. S3E and S6A), mouse, and chick limb development33,34, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role reutilized for limb regeneration. Meis2 was significantly higher in PBs at 14 DPA but was generally lower than Meis1 (Fig. 1D, E). Neither Meis1 nor Meis2 expression differed in the epithelium of PBs and DBs at any time point (Fig. S2D), underscoring the importance of mesenchymal cells in conveying PD positional identity within the blastema.

We next examined Hoxa9, Hoxa11, and Hoxa13 which have a known role in establishing both the amphibian regenerating and developing PD axis by providing positional identity to each limb segment7,8,9. We observed similar Hoxa9 expression in blastemas at each amputation location (Fig. 1G), while Hoxa11 was elevated in blastemas amputated at the UZ and autopod levels relative to US and LS amputations (Fig. 1H). Hoxa13 was significantly more highly expressed in autopod amputations compared to any other amputation level (Fig. 1I), reflecting activation of more 5' Hox genes in increasingly distal limb amputations. Additionally, we found that Hoxa9, Hoxa11, and Hoxa13 were expressed in mesenchymal and epithelial cells (Fig. S2F–H).

We observed that Hoxa9, Hoxa11, and Hoxa13 were expressed uniformly in the mesenchyme of DBs at 7, 10, and 14 DPA (Fig. 1J, Figs. S2I and S7). In PBs at 7 DPA, only Hoxa9 was expressed in the mesenchyme while Hoxa11 and Hoxa13 were absent (Fig. S2I). By 10 DPA, Hoxa9 and Hoxa11 were expressed in the mesenchyme of PBs, but Hoxa13 remained low (Fig. 1J, K, Fig. S2J). At 14 DPA, Hoxa9 was expressed throughout the mesenchyme of PBs at similar levels as DBs (Fig. 1J, K, Fig. S2J), and Hoxa11 was detected in cells from the mid-blastema to the distal tip (Fig. 1J–L). Hoxa13 was detected in the distal-most mesenchymal cells of PBs, although at lower levels than in DBs (Fig. 1J–L). This colinear activation of 5' Hox genes mirrors Hoxa9, Hoxa11, and Hoxa13 expression during limb development (Figs. S2K and S6B), supporting the hypothesis that progressive specification establishes PD positional identity in both processes7.

We hypothesized that RA signaling pathway members regulate RA signaling levels in response to PD patterning genes. We reasoned that a candidate gene would be expressed in the blastema mesenchyme, show graded expression along the PD axis, and complement the spatiotemporal expression of Meis1, Hoxa11, and Hoxa13, which direct limb morphogenesis35. To this end, we focused on RA receptors (Rara, Rarg), genes involved in RA synthesis (Raldh1, Raldh2, Raldh3), and genes involved in RA degradation (Cyp26a1, Cyp26b1). Both Rara and Rarg were expressed in the mesenchyme, but their expression did not match Meis1, Hoxa11, and Hoxa13 (Figs. S8 and S9). Raldh1 and Raldh2 expression did not differ between PBs and DBs, and Raldh3 did not exhibit a spatiotemporal expression pattern comparable to that of Meis, Hoxa11, and Hoxa13 (Figs. S10 and S11). We next investigated RA degradation in PBs and DBs and found that Cyp26a1 expression was higher in US blastemas and decreased in distal amputations (Fig. 2A). Conversely, Cyp26b1 expression was highest in autopod level amputations and decreased in more proximal amputation locations (Fig. 2B). Cyp26a1 and Cyp26b1 expression levels appeared to form gradients independent of limb segment, with similar levels in blastemas amputated at the LS and UZ (Fig. 2A, B). ScRNA-seq did not detect Cyp26a1, but Cyp26b1 was highly expressed in the mesenchyme and epidermis of DBs (Fig. S12A, B). Spatially, Cyp26a1 expression was similar in PBs and DBs and showed no bias towards the epithelium or mesenchyme (Fig. 2C, D, Figs. S12C–E and S13). This difference in Cyp26a1 detection between our HCR-FISH and qRT-PCR results is likely due to the higher sensitivity of qRT-PCR. In contrast, epithelial Cyp26b1 was observed in PBs and DBs at 7 DPA but was more highly expressed in the mesenchyme of DBs (Fig. S12C). By 10 DPA, Cyp26b1 expression was similar in the epithelium of PBs and DBs, but significantly higher in the mesenchyme of DBs (Fig. 2C, D). At 14 DPA, Cyp26b1 was no longer differentially expressed between PBs and DBs (Fig. 2C, D), but was concentrated at the distal tip of PBs, tapering off proximally (Fig. 2E). Finally, the spatiotemporal expression of Cyp26b1 within the mesenchyme resembled that of Hoxa11 and Hoxa13 while appearing negatively correlated with Meis1 (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that Cyp26b1 expression is graded in mesenchymal cells along the PD axis and its spatiotemporal expression correlates with PD patterning genes.

We hypothesized that positional identity along the regenerating PD axis depends on RA degradation in the blastema. To test this, we used talarozole (TAL, or R115866) to inhibit CYP26 during limb regeneration. Three TAL concentrations (0.1 µM, 1 µM, and 5 µM) or DMSO were administered at 4 DPA30 to animals with proximally amputated left limbs and distally amputated right limbs for 7 days (Fig. 3A). The skeletal structures of regenerates were then analyzed for abnormalities in morphology (Fig. 3A). At 14 DPA, we observed that drug treated blastemas were smaller than DMSO controls (Fig. S14A, B). After fully regenerating, DMSO treated limbs and proximally amputated limbs treated with 0.1 µM or 1 µM TAL exhibited normal skeletal morphology (Fig. 3B, Table S2). At 5 µM TAL, 15.4% of proximally amputated limbs regenerated without skeletal irregularities while limbs in the remaining 84.6% regressed to the scapula and failed to regenerate (Fig. 3B). Conversely, 92.3% of distally amputated limbs treated with 0.1 µM TAL exhibited whole (61.2%) or partial (30.1%) zeugopod duplications while 7.7% displayed no limb duplications (Fig. 3B). Increasing TAL to 1 µM resulted in full (66.7%) or partial (33.3%) stylopod duplications from distal amputations (Fig. 3B). Treatment with 5 µM TAL inhibited regeneration in 92.3% of distally amputated limbs, while 7.7% showed full humerus duplication (Fig. 3B). These results mirror both the inhibition of limb regeneration by excess retinoids36 and PD duplications observed in regenerating Xenopus laevis hindlimbs after TAL treatment37.

Limb duplications after TAL treatment resembled the effects of administering excess RA to regenerating limbs. To determine if TAL increased RA signaling, we administered 0.1 µM or 1 µM TAL to RA reporter animals20 and assessed GFP expression in DBs at 10 DPA. We observed increased GFP signal and Gfp expression following TAL administration (Fig. 3C- D), indicating TAL increased RA signaling in the blastema. Additionally, mesenchymal Cyp26b1 decreased in DBs treated with 1 µM TAL while Cyp26a1 expression was unaffected (Figs. 2C and 3E, F, Fig. S14E). However, epithelial Cyp26a1 was elevated following TAL treatment (Fig. 3E-F), suggesting that CYP26A1 degrades detrimental levels of RA in the epithelium but is uninvolved in regulating mesenchymal RA levels.

Previous studies have shown that excess RA decreases Hoxa137,9,22, leading us to hypothesize that Hoxa13 would similarly decrease following TAL treatment. To address this, we utilized Hoxa13 reporter animals38 to visualize the impact of TAL on HOXA13. DMSO treated DBs demonstrated strong mCHERRY signal at 14 DPA, whereas expression was absent in DBs treated with 1 µM TAL (Fig. 3G). We also observed reduced Hoxa13 expression at the transcript level (Fig. S14C, D, F), showing that Hoxa13 decreases following TAL administration.

Our results indicate that TAL increases mesenchymal RA signaling in DBs, leading to both concentration-dependent increases in RA signaling and skeletal morphologies that mimic RA-induced limb duplications. Considering Cyp26a1 and Cyp26b1 expression (Figs. 2C, D and 3E, F), the final skeletal morphologies are likely due to inhibition of CYP26B1, not CYP26A1. Moreover, we observed no change in skeletal morphology of proximally amputated limbs treated with the same TAL concentration that caused full limb duplication in distally amputated limbs, indicating RA breakdown is crucial for positional identity in distally, not proximally, amputated limbs. However, most PBs treated with 5 µM TAL failed to regenerate, suggesting that some RA breakdown is necessary for limb regeneration in PBs (Fig. 3B, Table S2).

To elucidate the mechanism behind TAL-induced proximalization of DBs, we cotreated animals with TAL and either disulfiram (DIS), a pan RALDH inhibitor, or AGN 193109 (RAA), a pan-RAR antagonist. Treatments were administered as above (Fig. 3A), with DIS or RAA administered alone or with 1 µM TAL. DMSO treated limbs appeared phenotypically normal regardless of treatment condition (Fig. S15A–D, Tables S3 and S4). Animals treated with DIS or RAA alone showed either no phenotype or minor skeletal abnormalities from both proximally and distally amputated limbs, but nothing that appeared to affect PD patterning (Fig. S15A, B, Tables S3 and S4). In distally amputated limbs treated with 1 µM TAL and 0.1 µM DIS, all limbs were duplicated at the radius/ulna level (Fig. S15C, Table S3). Similarly, 80% of the limbs treated with 1 µM TAL and 1 µM DIS showed either half duplication of the radius/ulna or no duplication (Table S3). These results show that DIS inhibits full proximalization of TAL-treated DBs, indicating that RA synthesis is required for proximalization. We next administered 1 µM TAL and either 0.1 µM or 1 µM RAA to animals with proximal and distal amputations. None of the distally amputated limbs treated with 1 µM TAL and 0.1 µM RAA showed duplications (Fig. S15D, Table S4), and 83.3% of those treated with 1 µM TAL and 1 µM RAA (Table S4) failed to duplicate. This shows RA signaling through RARs is necessary for limb duplication.

We next hypothesized that increasing TAL concentration in DBs would progressively reprogram DBs into a more PB-like identity. Additionally, we hypothesized that reprogramming would be driven by RA-responsive genes that are differentially expressed along the PD axis. We tested these hypotheses using bulk RNA-seq on DBs treated with DMSO, 0.1 µM TAL, 1 µM TAL, and PBs treated with DMSO at 14 DPA. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed segregation between treatment groups including PBs and DBs treated with DMSO (Fig. 4A). DBs treated with 0.1 or 1 µM TAL were more transcriptionally similar to each other compared to either DMSO treated PBs or DBs (Fig. 4A, Fig. S14A). TAL-treated DBs exhibited transcriptomes more akin to DMSO treated PBs, suggesting a shift towards a more PB-like positional identity (Fig. 4A, Fig. S16A–N). However, the transition from DB to PB is likely incomplete, impacting gene expression beyond just positional information.

We classified these transcriptional differences using hierarchical clustering of the top 371 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (padj <0.01, FC > 1.5) and observed four clusters (Fig. 4B). In cluster one, we observed RA-responsive genes upregulated by 1 µM TAL, including Cyp26a1, Krt15, and Acan which are known to be upregulated in response to RA (Fig. 4B)22,39. Considering these genes were not differentially expressed in PBs and DBs, it is unlikely that they play a role in PD positional identity. Cluster two consisted of genes highly expressed in DMSO-treated PBs, some of which increased in TAL treated DBs concentrations, while cluster three included genes highly expressed in DMSO-treated DBs. TAL treatment generally decreased cluster three gene expression, with the lowest levels in DMSO-treated PBs (Fig. 4B). Cluster four represents a transitional phase between DBs treated with 0.1 µM and 1 µM TAL, containing genes that are highly expressed in DBs treated with DMSO and 0.1 µM TAL but lowly expressed in DBs treated with 1 µM TAL and PBs treated with DMSO (Fig. 4B). The number of DEGs relative to DMSO treated DBs increases from 363 to 889 (padj <0.1) as TAL concentration rises from 0.1 or 1 µM, respectively (Fig. 4C). In comparison, DMSO treated PBs contained 539 DEGs (padj <0.1) relative to DMSO treated DBs (Fig. 4C). The number of DEGs between DMSO treated DBs and 1 µM TAL treated DBs was higher than between DMSO treated DBs and PBs, likely reflecting RA-responsive genes from cluster one not involved in PD patterning. DMSO treated PBs had 425 and 733 DEGs (padj <0.1) compared to 0.1 or 1 µM TAL treated DBs, showing that while TAL treated DBs adopted a more PB-like identity, differences remained (Fig. 4C).

Comparisons between DMSO treated DBs and either DMSO treated PBs or 1 µM TAL treated DBs enabled identification of RA-responsive genes associated with proximal or distal limb identity. We found that 138 DEGs (FDR < 0.1) were shared between both comparisons (Fig. 4D). Among these genes, we identified several that have known roles in patterning the developing or regenerating limb, including Pax940, Evx141, and Alx442 (Fig. 4E). Notably absent were Meis1, Meis2, and Cyp26b1 despite our previous results (Figs. 1–2) and their known roles as RA-responsive genes involved in PD patterning18,22,39,43. We suspect these genes were absent from our RNAseq analysis due to equally high levels in the wound epithelium of PBs and DBs (Figs. S2D, J and S12D). However, we observed significantly different expression levels of mesenchymal Cyp26b1, Meis1, and Meis2 in DBs treated with 1 µM TAL compared to DMSO treated DBs at 14 DPA (Figs. 3E, F and 4F–G, Fig. S16O), indicating that these genes are both involved in patterning and responsive to TAL treatment. Together, our results show that TAL treatment induces DBs to adopt a more proximal positional identity, likely mediated by RA-responsive patterning genes differentially expressed between PBs and DBs.

Among RA-responsive genes that were differentially expressed between PBs and DBs were Shox and Shox2 (Fig. 4E). Shortened limbs are frequently observed in humans with Shox haploinsufficiency, which is commonly linked to idiopathic short stature, Turner syndrome, and Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis44,45. While mice lack a functional Shox ortholog, Shox2 mutant mice develop with shortened humeri46. In the axolotl, SHOX and SHOX2 share 73.98% sequence similarity and contain a 100% identical homeodomain (Fig. S17A). Shox and Shox2 have previously been noted for their potential role in proximal positional identity during axolotl limb regeneration43, and were more epigenetically accessible in uninjured connective tissue (CT) cells of the stylopod compared to those of the autopod10. These findings suggest that Shox and Shox2 are involved in maintaining and reestablishing proximal limb positional information during limb regeneration.

To explore the role of Shox and Shox2 in patterning the PD axis, we visualized Shox and Shox2 expression in developing limb buds from stage 44-47 (Fig. 5A, Fig. S18). During limb development, we observed high levels of Shox throughout the mesenchyme of stage 44 limb buds with Shox2 localized to the posterior mesenchyme. At stage 47, Shox2 expression remained in the posterior limb mesenchyme but was proximally biased (Fig. 5A). Shox was exclusively expressed in the proximal mesenchyme of the stage 47 limb bud, leaving a Hoxa13+ zone of distal mesenchymal cells devoid of Shox expression (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that Shox is involved in establishing proximal limb identity during limb development.

We next examined Shox and Shox2 expression following limb amputation. In agreement with our RNA-seq results, Shox and Shox2 expression increased in DBs upon 1 µM TAL treatment and were more highly expressed in US amputations compared to autopod amputations (Fig. 5B–E). Shox expression appeared to decrease incrementally in more distal amputations whereas Shox2 was expressed at the same level in LS blastemas and autopod blastemas (Fig. 5D, E). We also observed that while Shox2 expression in PBs treated with 1 µM TAL was identical to DMSO treated PBs, Shox expression was significantly lower in PBs treated with 1 µM TAL compared to control PBs (Fig. S17B, C). These results suggest that Shox is more sensitive to heightened RA levels observed in PBs treated with 1 µM TAL than Shox2. Furthermore, Shox and Shox2 were primarily expressed in mesenchymal cells with little expression in any other cell type (Fig. S17D, E). As in limb development, Shox2 expression in PBs and DBs at 7, 10, or 14 DPA was localized proximally and posteriorly in mesenchymal cells (Fig. 5F–H, Figs. S17F and S19). Shox2 expression levels in PBs and DBs at 10 DPA were similar, but by 14 DPA Shox2 was significantly more highly expressed in the proximal and posterior mesenchyme of PBs (Fig. 5F, G). This may indicate that Shox2 has a role in patterning both the PD and AP axis during limb development and regeneration. Shox was lowly expressed in the mesenchyme of PBs and DBs at 7 DPA (Fig. S17F). By 10 DPA, Shox expression was located throughout the mesenchyme of PBs and was significantly more highly expressed than in DBs (Fig. 5F–H). The limited areas of Shox expression in DBs at 10 and 14 DPA seemed to be associated with the uninjured skeletal elements (Fig. 5F). At 14 DPA, Shox remained significantly more highly expressed in PBs but was restricted to the Meis1+ proximal mesenchyme, leaving a distal subset of Hoxa13+ cells devoid of Shox expression (Fig. 5F–J, Fig. S17G, H). Shox+ and Hoxa13+ cells appeared mutually exclusive (Fig. 5J, K), suggesting that Shox is uninvolved in autopod formation.

The spatiotemporal expression patterns of Shox, Meis1, and Hoxa13 (Fig. 5H–K) suggest that Shox is activated by Meis1 and repressed by Hoxa13. Given that Meis1 is RA-responsive (Fig. 4F, G), this overlap in expression may indicate that mesenchymal Shox is activated by RA via Meis1. Indeed, the Shox promoter contains several putative Meis1 binding sites (Table S5). Conversely, Hoxa13 is repressed by RA (Figs. 3G and 4E), suggesting that Hoxa13 is involved in creating the distal limit for Shox.

Our gene expression results led us to hypothesize that Shox has a role in establishing both stylopod and zeugopod, but not autopod, positional identity during both limb development and regeneration. To test this hypothesis, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to genetically inactivate Shox. We targeted Shox with two sgRNAs specifically designed against exons 1 and 2 and simultaneously injected these sgRNAs into axolotl embryos to create mosaic F0 Shox knockout animals (Shox crispants) (Fig. 6A). NGS genotyping analyses of 10 Shox crispants indicated that both targeted loci were highly mutated, ranging from 75.15 to 97.62% of all sequenced alleles being mutated across each animal (Fig. S20A–D). Furthermore, these animals developed to adulthood, enabling us to examine the role of Shox during limb development and regeneration. Shox crispants developed significantly smaller limbs than controls with significantly smaller stylopods and zeugopods (Fig. 6B, C). Interestingly, autopod length was unaffected in Shox crispants compared to controls (Fig. 6C), showing that Shox is critical for stylopod and zeugopod development but dispensable for autopod development. To confirm this finding, we generated F1 homozygous Shox knockout axolotls (Shox−/− animals) by crossing two Shox crispants. Like the F0 crispants, Shox−/− animals exhibited shortened stylopodial and zeugopodial elements, while their autopods appeared relatively unaffected (Fig. S20E). This indicates that despite mosaicism, F0 crispants display the same limb phenotype as F1 Shox−/− animals. A similar phenotype was observed in the limbs of Shox2 knockout mice, where chondrocytes in shortened stylopods and zeugopods failed to proliferate and mature, preventing endochondral ossification46.

We observed that while skeletal elements in adult control stylopods and zeugopods were partially calcified, those from Shox crispants appeared to lack calcification (Fig. 6D). Additionally, chondrocytes from control stylopods demonstrated clear progression from proliferation to hypertrophy before calcifying (Fig. 6E). In contrast, chondrocytes from Shox crispants failed to proliferate, appearing to remain as reserve cartilage through adulthood (Fig. 6E). Considering autopod size was not impacted in Shox crispant limbs, we next examined the digits of Shox crispants limbs to determine if endochondral ossification in autopodial elements was disrupted. Chondrocytes from both control and Shox crispant digits underwent phenotypically normal endochondral ossification, suggesting that while essential for more proximal limb segments, Shox is not required for autopodial skeletal maturation (Fig. 6E). This indicates that proximal and distal skeletal elements of the limb have distinct transcriptional programs responsible for endochondral ossification. Collectively, our data indicate that Shox is required for chondrocyte maturation within proximal skeletal elements. During limb development, however, many Shox+ cells are Sox9-, suggesting that Shox may also be involved in patterning non-chondrogenic mesenchymal cells (Fig. 6F, Fig. S20F).

Finally, we found that Shox was dispensable for limb regeneration, as Shox crispants successfully regenerated limbs and progressed though typical stages, including blastema and palette formation, without obvious abnormalities (Fig. 7A). Shox crispant limbs remained shortened after fully regenerating, suggesting that Shox is dispensable for limb regeneration but crucial for patterning the regenerating stylopodial and zeugopodial segments (Fig. 7A). This finding was also confirmed in Shox−/− animals, which regenerated similarly sized autopods as controls but significantly smaller stylopods and zeugopods (Fig. S21). We further observed that while many Shox+ cells in PBs at 21 DPA were Sox9+, many other Shox+ cells were Prrx1+ and Sox9- (Fig. 7B, C). Additionally, Sox9 was expressed in the presumptive digits of DBs at 21 DPA (Fig. 7C, Fig. S22), indicating that Shox is not required to activate Sox9 expression. Together, these results both suggest that chondrocyte formation is independent of Shox and that Shox has an additional role in patterning non-chondrogenic mesenchymal cells during limb regeneration.

We next assessed Meis1 and Hoxa13 expression in Shox−/− PBs and DBs and found their spatial expression patterns unchanged compared to controls (Fig. 7D, Fig. S22), consistent with findings from Shox2 KO mice46. Correspondingly, the relative expression of these genes in Shox−/− PBs and DBs was unchanged from controls (Fig. 7E, F). These results suggest that PD positional identity is unaffected by the absence of Shox. Furthermore, while Shox2 was expressed in the posterior mesenchyme of both control and Shox−/− DBs, it was generally more lowly expressed in Shox−/− DBs (Fig. 7D, G). In contrast, Shox2 expression expanded into the anterior mesenchyme of Shox−/− PBs, though its levels remained unchanged compared to controls (Fig. 7D, G). This suggests that Shox2 compensates for the loss of Shox in Shox−/− PBs.

The observations that Hoxa13 and Meis1 expression are unaffected by Shox knockout (Fig. 7D–F), along with Meis1 and Shox colocalization (Fig. 5H, I), suggest that Shox acts downstream of Meis1 to regulate endochondral ossification of proximal skeletal elements. Considering Meis1 is RA-responsive and limb-specific Meis KO mice lack proximal skeletal elements14, RA likely directs proximal endochondral ossification through Shox via Meis1. Consistent with this, Cyp26b1 was significantly more highly expressed in Shox−/− DBs than Shox−/− PBs (Fig. 7H). In addition, Cyp26b1 expression levels did not vary between control DBs and Shox−/− DBs, as well as between control PBs and Shox−/− PBs (Fig. 7H). These observations suggest both that Shox does not determine RA concentration in the blastema and physiological levels of RA are similar in regenerating control and Shox−/− limbs. Further, Shox crispant DBs treated with 1 µM TAL regenerate with shortened duplicated proximal elements (Fig. 7I), showing that Shox crispant limbs respond to RA but cannot properly pattern proximal elements.

Our study shows that regulation of endogenous RA levels is required for PD limb patterning during regeneration. We propose that Cyp26b1-mediated RA breakdown, not RA synthesis or RAR expression, determines PD positional identity by setting the RA signaling levels in the blastema, activating or repressing RA signaling (Fig. 8). Moreover, CT cells in the uninjured limb have inherent, epigenetically encoded positional identity10. Upon amputation, these cells dedifferentiate into a limb bud-like state while retaining their PD positional memory2. We propose that dedifferentiated blastema cells modify Cyp26b1 expression depending on their positional memory, which adjusts RA signaling levels to the appropriate PD location and regulates genes that convey PD positional identity. Elevated RA levels in PBs activate Shox, promoting endochondral ossification in proximal skeletal elements. In contrast, reduced RA levels in DBs leads to a Shox-independent mechanism for endochondral ossification of distal skeletal elements. Our results show that RA signaling levels exert segment-specific effects during skeleton regeneration (Fig. 8).

Proposed model for how PD patterning occurs during axolotl limb regeneration.

The model that we propose explains how positional identity is determined among cells at two spatial scales: the entire limb PD axis and PD axes within different limb segments. Cyp26b1 expression was graded across the limb PD axis, with similar levels of expression observed between blastemas that formed from different, but spatially juxtaposed limb segments (e.g., LS and UZ blastemas). However, within limb segments, Cyp26b1 expression differed considerably between blastemas that formed from spatially disparate locations (e.g., US and LS blastemas). Our model suggests that positional identity is conveyed in a segment specific manner, as Shox expression is mutually exclusive from Hoxa13 and Shox perturbation affects only stylopodial and zeugopodial skeletal elements. Further evidence for this comes from Hoxa13 knockout newts that fail to regenerate autopods8. This may imply that each limb segment requires a specific threshold of positional values determined by RA signaling levels, as posited by the French Flag model5. Once this threshold is met, blastema cells can create intra-segmental positional values based on RA signaling levels, enabling fine-tuning of limb segment morphology. It may also explain why half-segment duplications are observed following treatment with lower concentrations of TAL or RA during limb regeneration29,30.

While our model specifically focuses on RA degradation in PBs and DBs, it does not address RA synthesis along the regenerating PD axis. Our results present two possibilities: (1) heightened levels of RA synthesis at more proximal amputations and (2) identical levels of RA synthesis at any amputation level that is fine-tuned at each amputation location by RA degradation. Regarding the former, our qRT-PCR analysis revealed that Raldh3 expression was significantly higher in proximal amputations compared to distal amputations, suggesting that elevated RA levels in PBs are generated primarily through Raldh3 rather than Raldh1 or Raldh2. However, this finding was inconsistent with our FISH and RNAseq results, which showed no differences in expression of Raldh1, Raldh2, and Raldh3 between PBs and DBs. Furthermore, inhibiting RA synthesis in PBs and DBs caused skeletal abnormalities in the final regenerate at each amputation location. These results are more consistent with the possibility that RA synthesis is uniform along the PD axis. Nevertheless, our results do not exclude either scenario, and future studies are needed to ascertain RA synthesis levels along the PD axis. An outstanding question related to this is why RA would be synthesized in the regenerating limb only to be degraded depending on amputation location. While our work does not address this complexity directly, we speculate that RA has several roles during limb regeneration outside of providing proximal limb positional identity. RA is important for directing nerves to their targets, including epithelial and neuromuscular junctions47. Furthermore, RA plays an essential role in replenishing epithelial cells during physiological growth48, which may contribute to the scarless wound healing following injuries in salamanders49.

Further studies are needed to identify upstream activators of Cyp26b1 during amphibian limb regeneration. We observed that Cyp26b1 exhibited a similar spatiotemporal expression pattern as Hoxa11 and Hoxa13, providing circumstantial evidence that 5' Hox genes regulate Cyp26b1 expression. Previous studies on mouse limb development have suggested that AER-derived FGFs activate Cyp26b1 instead of 5' Hox genes to create a domain of distal identity while simultaneously interacting with SHH to promote distal outgrowth17. Indeed, Fgf8 expression in Cyp26b1−/− limbs does not appear to be impacted by the loss of CYP26B1 function18. However, this may differ during limb regeneration as the SHH-FGF feedback loop is required for blastema distal outgrowth and proliferation50, and neither Fgf8 nor Shh were differentially expressed between PBs and DBs in our RNA-seq. For these reasons, it seems more likely that Cyp26b1 is regulated by 5' Hox genes including Hoxa11 and Hoxa13 during limb regeneration.

How a cell conveys its PD positional identity to neighboring cells in response to RA to coordinate patterning in the blastema remains an unanswered question in the field. Several lines of evidence suggest that differences in adhesivity and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) differentiate PBs from DBs51. These differences in adhesivity can be modified by RA, suggesting that RA signaling levels are important for generating a gradient of adhesive properties in PBs and DBs52,53. In agreement with these studies, two CAMs, TIG1 and PROD1, have previously been identified that are RA-responsive and modify adhesivity during limb regeneration38,54. Neither of these CAMs appeared to be RA-responsive or differentially expressed in PBs and DBs, despite their importance in directing cell adhesivity during limb regeneration. However, our RNAseq represents only a small portion of gene expression during the entire duration of limb regeneration. Indeed, Tig1 expression appears strongest at earlier timepoints, which may explain its absence from our dataset38. Nonetheless, our RNA-seq dataset should serve as a helpful resource for identifying other RA-responsive CAMs that are differentially expressed in PBs and DBs.

Transgenic lines (RA reporter- tgSceI(RARE:GFP)Pmx, Hoxa13 reporter- tm(Hoxa13t/+:Hoxa13-T2A-mCHERRY)Etnka) used in this study were bred at Northeastern University. d/d genotype axolotls (RRID:AGSC 101E; RRID:AGSC101L) were bred at Northeastern University or were obtained from the Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center (RRID: SCR_006372). Crispant lines were generated at both Northeastern University and the University of Kentucky. An equal distribution of males and females were used in this study. All surgeries were performed under anesthesia using 0.01% benzocaine and were approved by the Northeastern University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Talarozole and AGN 193109 were resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to 5 mM and stored at −20 °C. Disulfiram was resuspended in DMSO to 20 mM and stored at −20 °C. Animals received amputations through the carpals on one limb and through the upper humerus on the contralateral limb. Four days post amputation (DPA), animals were placed in drug or DMSO. Animals were redosed every other day for 7 days. Following treatment, animals were removed from the drug water and placed into axolotl housing water. Regenerated limbs were collected from the animals 120 days post treatment for analysis of skeletal morphology.

Blastema tissue (4–5 blastemas per sample, 3–6 samples per experiment) was collected from 3.5 cm animals head to tail (HT) aged 2.5 months and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA isolation and qRT-PCR were performed with standard protocols, using 1 ng of cDNA per reaction. Each qRT-PCR reaction was run in duplicate. Primers for each gene are listed in Table S1. Gene expression was normalized to Ef1α and the Livak 2−ΔΔCq method was used to quantify relative fold change in mRNA abundance. Statistical significance between groups was tested using either a two-tailed Student's t-test or a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test on ΔCt values. Linear regression analysis was performed to test for linear relationships across samples.

Existing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from proximally amputated forelimbs was accessed from NCBI SRA PRJNA58948432. UMI counts for gene expression data were generated using kallisto55 and bustools56 against Ambystoma mexicanum transcriptome v4.757. Isoform-level count matrices were generated using “bustools count” with the --em flag. Counts matrices were imported into Seurat v558 in an RStudio IDE. Cells expressing fewer than 200 features and features expressed in fewer than 3 cells were filtered out; matrices were further filtered to include cells with between 500 and 25,000 counts, <5% red blood cell gene content, and <15% mitochondrial gene content. Counts were normalized using the SCTransform function with regression for mitochondrial content and red blood cell content. The counts layers were flattened with the IntegrateLayers function using RPCAIntegration, after which FindClusters was run with a resolution of 0.4 followed by RunUMAP using the first 30 dimensions, 50 nearest neighbors, and a minimum distance of 0.1. Following cluster annotation, SCTransform-normalized isoform-level expression for genes of interest was summed and log-transformed for plotting with ggplot2 using UMAP coordinates from Seurat59.

Whole mount and tissue section version 3 hybridization chain reaction fluorescence in-situ hybridization (HCR-FISH) protocols were performed as previously described60 with slight modifications on the tissue section protocol. Namely, fresh frozen blastema tissue from 3.5 cm animals (HT) aged 2.5 months were sectioned at 10 µm. Slides were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min at room temperature and washed with 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times for 5 min at room temperature before being stored in 70% ethanol at 4 °C until use. Slides were washed again three times for 5 min with 1X PBS at room temperature before beginning HCR-FISH protocol. Probes for each gene were generated using ProbeGenerator (http://ec2-44-211-232-78.compute-1.amazonaws.com) and can be found in the source data file.

All tissue sections were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope at 20X magnification with airyscan fast settings. For each image, 4–6 optical sections were captured in the 10 µm tissue section. Following acquisition, images were processed on Zen Black using airyscan processing with the automatic 2D setting, then a maximum intensity projection step was performed. If obvious issues in tile alignment were observed, an additional stitching step was performed prior to maximum intensity projection.

Whole mount samples stained using HCR-FISH were mounted in 1.5% low-melt agarose and refractive index matched with EasyIndex (LifeCanvas Technologies) overnight at 4 °C60. Samples were then imaged in EasyIndex using a Zeiss Lightsheet Z1 at 20X magnification. All representative images are a single z-plane from the stack.

Dot detection in HCR-FISH images was performed using RS FISH61. For visualization of HCR-FISH dots in figure pictures, RS-FISH dots were flattened atop the DAPI channel and background dots outside tissue sections were removed. For quantification, identified dots from RS-FISH were overlaid on a black background and the image was flattened. The ImageJ function “Find Maxima” with prominence greater than 0 was used to convert dots to single pixels. Cell outlines were obtained using Cellpose segmentation run on the DAPI channel using the “cyto2” model with default settings and a diameter of 6062. A modified version of the region of interest conversion script provided by the Cellpose authors was used to obtain measurements of area and raw integrated density per cell. Pipeline documentation can be accessed at https://github.com/Monaghan-Lab/HCRFISH-DotCounting.

All measurements were concatenated and filtered for cells with an area greater than 60, as smaller areas can indicate poor segmentation or cells at a nonoptimal plane. To evaluate the expression levels for each gene between groups, two-tailed clustered Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (n = 2–6 blastemas, sample size for each group located within the source data file) were performed with FDR p-adjustment using the R package “clusrank” with test method “ds”63. Violin plots were generated in RStudio using the ggplot2 package59.

Images of RS-FISH maxima were rotated with no interpolation such that the top of the image represented the most proximal end of the blastema. An equal rotation was performed on the DAPI channel from the same tissue. The freehand selection tool was used to isolate the blastemal mesenchyme from the DAPI image, then this selection was overlaid onto the rotated maxima image and used to clear any points lying outside of the selection before adding a value of 25 to each pixel within the blastema selection. The value z at every (x,y) pixel in the image was then measured.

Measurements for each image were imported into R and filtered for z > 0 to select for points falling only within the blastemal mesenchyme. The y values were then rescaled to generate a pseudo-proximodistal axis with range [0, 1]. Z values were reassigned such that 25 represented a 0 or “negative” pixel and 255 represented a 1 or “positive” pixel, then grouped at each pseudo-y value and averaged to yield a proportion of positive pixels. The square root of these proportions was plotted as a smoothed curve along the pseudo-proximodistal axis using the “stat_smooth()” function in ggplot2 with an n of 200059. A sample script can be accessed at https://github.com/Monaghan-Lab/HCRFISH-DotCounting.

Whole mount alcian blue/alizarin red staining was performed using a modified version of a previously published protocol64. Briefly, regenerated limbs were collected and immediately fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C. The next day, limbs were washed three times for 5 min each with 1X PBS at room temperature and skinned. Limbs were dehydrated in 25%, 50%, and 100% ethanol for 20 min at each concentration before being placed in alcian blue mixture (5 mg alcian blue in 30 mL 100% ethanol, 20 mL acetic acid) and left on a rocker overnight at room temperature. The next day, limbs were rehydrated in 100%, 50%, and 25% ethanol for 20 min at room temperature at each concentration. Limbs were placed into trypsin solution (1% trypsin in 30% borax) and rocked for 45 min at room temperature. Samples were washed twice in 1% KOH for 30 min each before being placed in alizarin red mixture (5 mg alizarin red in 50 mL 1% KOH) and rocked overnight at room temperature. Limbs were again washed twice with 1% KOH for 30 min at room temperature and placed in 25% glycerol/1% KOH solution until samples cleared. The limbs were then dehydrated in 25%, 50%, and 100% ethanol for 20 min at room temperature at each concentration. Finally, limbs were placed in 25%, 50%, and 75% glycerol solutions (made in 100% ethanol) before being stored in 100% glycerol for imaging.

Animals received a proximal amputation through the upper humerus of the left forelimb and a distal amputation through the carpals of the right forelimb. TAL was administered in the housing water as indicated above. Samples (n = 3 samples per condition, 2-3 blastemas per sample, 5 cm (HT) animals aged 3 months) were collected at 14 DPA and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at −80 °C. Samples were shipped to Genewiz for RNA sequencing using an Illumina HiSeq platform and 150-bp paired-end reads for an average sequencing depth of roughly 24.1 million reads per sample. Raw sequencing data are available at GEO (accession number GSE272731).

Reads were quality trimmed before quasi-mapping to the v.47 axolotl transcriptome65 and quantification. Differential expression analysis was performed on counts matrices with DESeq2 v1.34.066 using the Trinity v2.8.5 script67 “run_DE_analysis.pl” with default parameters. Visualizations were produced with ggplot2, ggvenn, and ComplexHeatmap68 where appropriate. Sample correlation heatmap was produced using Trinity script “PtR” on the gene counts matrix67.

The first 20 Kb upstream the Shox transcriptional start site were analyzed for Meis1 binding sites using the web-based platform https://molotool.autosome.org.

Shox crispants were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 according to previous protocols69. The following sgRNAs were used:

Shox sgRNA 2—GAGGGAGGACGTGAAGTCGG

Shox sgRNA 3—GGCCAGGGCCCGGGAGCTGG

NGS-based genotyping was conducted on a pool of 10 tail tips from crispant animals and analyzed using CRISPResso270.

Samples for hematoxylin, eosin, and alcian blue staining (H&E&A) were collected and placed in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then washed with 1X PBS three times for 5 min each. Following the third wash, samples were placed in 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for four days at 4 °C. The EDTA solution was changed every other day. After EDTA treatment, the samples were again washed with 1X PBS three times for 5 min each before being cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. Once the samples sunk in the 30% sucrose, the samples were mounted in optimal cutting temperature medium and frozen at −80 °C until use. These blocks were then sectioned at 10 µm, and the resultant slides were baked at 65 °C overnight. To improve the adherence of the skeletal structure to the slide, slides were placed in 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature. Slides were washed three times for 5 min with 1X PBS, then the slides were placed in alcian blue solution (5 mg of alcian blue in 30 mL 100% ethanol and 20 mL acetic acid) for 10 min at room temperature. The slides were then dehydrated with 100% EtOH for 1 min at room temperature and allowed to air dry. Hematoxylin solution was added to the slides and incubated at room temperature for 7 min. Slides were then dipped into tap water five times, then clean tap water another 15 times. Slides were dipped another 15 times in clean tap water before adding bluing buffer for 2 min at room temperature. Slides were again dipped in clean tap water five times, and eosin solution was pipetted onto the slides for 2 min at room temperature. Residual eosin was removed by dipping slides ten times in clean tap water, and the slides were air dried before imaging.

Animals for each experiment were randomly selected. Sample size for each experiment is indicated in source data file. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. Statistical analyses are indicated within the figure legends and methods, and exact p-values are indicated in the source data file. Analyses were conducted on Matlab or R. Fluorescent images not compatible with RS-FISH and qRT-PCR samples that demonstrated abnormal amplification were excluded from the analyses. Experiments were replicated at least twice, and all attempts at replication were successful. The experiments were randomized, and the investigators were blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

Metrics details

Climate change assessments (CCAs) play a critical role in taking stock of the available science and other forms of knowledge and informing policy processes. As the underlying evidence base increases exponentially, the complexity also increases and challenges CCA author teams to capture all the relevant knowledge. Therefore, CCAs will need to transition from predominantly assessing primary research to focusing on the assessment and critical appraisal of knowledge syntheses of such work, alongside capturing knowledges held outside traditional scientific sources. To support this, a stronger knowledge synthesis culture is needed, and we propose key recommendations and offer guidance for producing robust, transparent, reproducible, inclusive and timely syntheses that can inform CCAs across scales.

Milli-spinner thrombectomy Blood clots can be extremely dangerous, potentially blocking oxygen from vital organs including the lungs and brain. One surgical treatment involves using suction to remove them from blood vessels but this isn't always successful. Now a surprising observation of the effect of spinning on blood clots has led to the development of a new technology - a ‘Milli-spinner' that could be a safer way to treat strokes and other conditions.

A new Covid variant is being kept under surveillance by the World Health Organization (WHO) as its emergence has led to an increase in infections in several regions of the world. First identified at the end of January, the variant—called NB.1.8.1 but known informally as “Nimbus”—is a descendant of the Omicron family of Covid sublineages, and has become increasingly prevalent throughout the spring in Europe, the Americas, and the Western Pacific.

The virus has mutations that may increase its infectiousness and allow it to escape certain antibodies. Nevertheless, “considering the available evidence, the additional public health risk posed by NB.1.8.1 is evaluated as low at the global level,” the WHO wrote in its most recent risk evaluation for the variant.

Like other variants before it, Nimbus has specific mutations to its spike protein. These proteins coat the virus's surface and are what it uses to gain entry into cells, where it reproduces. Nimbus' spike protein modifications could increase its transmission capacity and partially reduce the neutralizing efficacy of certain antibodies generated by previous infections, both of which would contribute to its spread.

However, the WHO says that there is no evidence that this variant causes more severe disease compared to other strains currently circulating. Nor have increases in hospitalizations or deaths related to its emergence been observed.

Symptoms associated with NB.1.8.1 are similar to those caused by other SARS-CoV-2 variants: sore throat, cough, fatigue, fever, muscle aches, loss of taste or smell, respiratory distress, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

The WHO experts explain that, although this variant may partially evade some antibody responses, such “immune escape” is comparable to that observed in other Omicron sublineages. This suggests that the mutations present in NB.1.8.1 do not give the virus increased resistance to antivirals such as nirmatrelvir, and that current vaccines continue to be effective in preventing severe disease when infected with this version of the virus.

However, to those most vulnerable to Covid—such as the elderly, immunocompromised, or those with preexisting chronic conditions—Nimbus represents a new health threat, and these groups should stay up to date with booster vaccinations to ensure they are protected against Covid's worst effects.

This year at WWDC 2025, Apple introduced a rather drastic change to its naming conventions. What should be the upcoming WatchOS 12 will now be WatchOS 26 when it launches in the fall, since the company decided to stop labeling its operating systems sequentially and instead name them according to the fiscal year they are released. Every OS now also has a new, overhauled display aesthetic called Liquid Glass, which makes certain apps, icons, buttons, and pop-ups look like frosted glass and other features look like raindrops.

Other than that, anticipated new Apple Intelligence features to most of the company's product lineup were small and measured rather than big and sweeping—but for Apple Watch fans, the fact that there is now Apple Intelligence on your wrist at all might be enough. Here, we walk through some of the new tips and tricks that you will start seeing on your Apple Watch this year.

WatchOS 26 will be available for Apple Watches starting from the Series 6 or later. This includes the second-gen Apple Watch SE and all Apple Watch Ultra models. You must also have an iPhone 11 or later that can run the upcoming iOS 26. If you want the Apple Intelligence features, you need to have an Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhone, which includes the iPhone 15, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and all iPhone 16 models.

You can download WatchOS 26 as a developer beta today, but don't expect it to be perfect. A public beta will roll out next month at beta.apple.com and WatchOS 26 will be available as a free software update to compatible Watch models this fall.

Unfortunately, most of the Liquid Glass redesigns have been optimized for the bigger screens of the Mac, iPhone, and iPad. But hey, look, the numerals on the clock face now have a translucent frost! You can also see slight specular highlights around the edges of the buttons when you look closely. Smart Stack—Apple's layered widget system—will also utilize Liquid Glass so as not to obscure the screen.

Workout Buddy uses all the exercise data accumulated by the Apple Watch—heart rate, pace, distance, etc.—and uses it to offer personalized, upbeat encouragement (“you crushed it!”) during your exercise session. Apple Intelligence analyzes your data to provide these insights and to use voice encouragement derived from Fitness+ trainers. It can also mark key moments, like running a mile particularly fast. It's available for just a few exercises, like indoor and outdoor walking or running, outdoor cycling, functional and traditional strength training, and HIIT—and yes, you can turn it off if the idea of a cheerleader in your ear is hell for you too.

The Workout app itself has also undergone a redesign, with four buttons in the four corners of the watch face to make it easier to tap on each feature. Users can set up music and podcasts within the Workout app, and Apple Music can either select music or provide suggestions for an appropriate playlist.

Smart Stack will now incorporate more contextual data, like location and the user's routine, to provide more helpful tips. For example, if you arrive at the gym at your usual time, your Apple Watch may mark your location and slide a workout routine to the top of your Smart Stack.

If you own a Watch Series 9, Watch Series 10, or Apple Watch Ultra 2, you will now be able to use a new wrist-flick gesture (much like Double Tap) to dismiss notifications or incoming calls, silence timers, and return to the clock face. A machine-learning model uses data from the accelerometer and gyroscope to catch the user's wrist movement.

The Watch now also supports Live Translation in Messages (again, you will need an Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhone). If your language is set to English, the watch will offer prompts in Messages, like suggesting Apple Cash if the user is asked for a donation. Call Screening and Hold Assist will also come to the phone app on the watch, letting users decide whether to take or decline calls or ask for more information.

As usual, there are new clock faces to choose from. And you will finally be able to use the Notes app on the watch, which may be more important to some of us than others.

Ariella Sharf was first prescribed antidepressants when she was a college student more than a decade ago. When she decided to stop taking them last year, Sharf says she wasn't sure how to do it safely. She was disappointed when her longtime psychiatrist didn't help her find a new doctor after she moved across the country, and she thought her primary care physician wasn't equipped for the task. Sharf decided instead to try Outro Health, a telehealth startup that CEO and cofounder Brandon Goode describes as “Uber for getting off antidepressants.”

Outro officially launched in the US last month and is currently available in seven states, including California and New York. The startup is betting that many of the growing number of Americans taking antidepressants will eventually want help coming off them. Over 11 percent of US adults took medication for depression in 2023, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health Interview Survey, which found women were more than twice as likely as men to use the drugs.

About one in six people who stop taking antidepressants experience side effects like nausea and dizziness, especially if they do so abruptly, according to one study. Other research has found the prevalence of adverse withdrawal symptoms may be much higher, particularly among patients who have been on them for long periods.

For a monthly fee starting at $125, Outro pairs patients with a clinician who meets with them on a custom schedule—often weekly or monthly—and guides them through a tailored tapering program. Outro currently employs a small group of medical contractors, including nurse practitioners specializing in psychiatry and general nurse practitioners, who are supervised by psychiatrists. For now, patients pay for the service entirely out of pocket, but Goode says Outro plans to start accepting insurance soon.

Outro's program is currently focused specifically on drugs often prescribed for depression, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Lexapro and Prozac, and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) like Pristiq and Cymbalta. In the next year, Goode says, the company is planning to expand beyond antidepressants and begin offering tapering programs for stimulants and benzodiazepines, two classes of drug that are commonly prescribed in the US for issues like anxiety and ADHD and are known to cause intense withdrawal symptoms.

“I was kind of waiting for something like Outro to exist,” says Sharf, who became one of the company's first patients in the United States last June as part of a pilot program in California. “Everything was tailored around how I wanted to do it.” Twelve months later, Sharf says she is still tapering off her medication with help from Outro at a pace that works for her.

When customers sign up for Outro and get matched with clinicians, they then typically follow a tapering method endorsed by one of Outro's other cofounders, the British academic psychiatrist Mark Horowitz. Known as “hyperbolic tapering,” it's a substantially more drawn-out process than other methods used to help people get off meds.

Unlike a linear taper, which involves reducing the dose of a medication by the same amount each time, a hyperbolic taper gradually slows the rate of reduction—cutting smaller and smaller amounts as it goes—so that the final doses are extremely small and spread out over a much longer period. To facilitate this, Outro partners with compounding pharmacies to produce custom versions of generic antidepressants in minuscule doses that are not available commercially. In other words, while Outro promotes itself as a service for getting off medication, part of its business model hinges on people continuing to take the compounded drugs its clinicians prescribe.

Horowitz, who has become one of the UK's leading experts on medication tapering, known as de-prescribing, says his interest in the topic was driven by his own harrowing experience coming off antidepressants more than a decade ago when he was a psychiatry doctoral student. Horowitz crafted a gradual tapering plan for himself that involved using syringes from his research lab to dole out small liquid doses of escitalopram, known by the brand name Lexapro. But he couldn't prevent the misery induced by discontinuing the drug.

“My life exploded,” Horowitz says. His symptoms, which included severe insomnia and dizziness, were so debilitating that he moved back in with his parents. “It took me years to come off, not weeks as guidelines recommended.”

After he recovered, Horowitz began pushing for doctors to adopt new clinical guidelines for getting off antidepressants. He coauthored the Royal College of Psychiatry's guidance for psychiatric drug cessation and joined the UK's National Health Service as a clinical research fellow. His goal with Outro is to bring the guided tapering methods he has developed to a new patient base in North America.

Goode, Outro's CEO, has a background working in pharmaceuticals and telehealth that includes stints at Novo Nordisk and the psychedelic therapy startup Field Trip Health, now known as Stella. “People kept asking how to use psychedelics to get off antidepressants,” Goode says, which led him to suspect there might be a substantial swath of the population who wanted help quitting the drugs.

Horowitz and Goode cofounded Outro in 2022 along with another Field Trip alum, Tyler Dyck. The company's small team also includes Adele Framer, the founder of Surviving Antidepressants, a long-running forum where people swap tips on how to taper off this class of medication.

It's a fraught moment to be launching a health startup in the US focused on getting people off psychiatric drugs. The US secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has questioned whether the medications are overprescribed, and has made false claims linking antidepressants to school shootings and increased violence. Similar views have been articulated by other Trumpworld figures, including DOGE architect Elon Musk, who told Tucker Carlson that SSRIs are “the devil.”

Horowitz says he shares some of Kennedy's concerns about whether antidepressants are overprescribed and how severe withdrawals can be. But he's disturbed that Outro's project could be seen as aligned with the health secretary's broader Make America Healthy Again movement, especially as he considers himself “to the left of Bernie Sanders.”

“The fact that this has become a political football is really dangerous,” he says. “These medications have benefits—and they have harms, and can be difficult to stop. My work is about helping people navigate those things in an informed way.”

There is a small but growing group of mental health experts who say it's time to reevaluate how antidepressant withdrawal is understood and treated. Anders Sørenson, a clinical psychologist in Denmark specializing in psychiatric de-prescribing, says the status quo for most patients is “not just inadequate, but often actively harmful.” He sees an urgent need for more doctors to craft hyperbolic tapering plans customized to each individual patient's needs.

Some psychiatry experts push back on the idea that hyperbolic tapering programs are necessary for many patients. Jonathan E. Alpert, a psychiatrist and professor at Montefiore's Albert Einstein College of Medicine, agrees that taking a thoughtful approach to tapering is important and says hyperbolic tapering “makes some sense neurobiologically.” But he thinks a large portion of people who want to quit psychiatric drugs can do so by using what he considers to be “less fussy” methods, like gradually halving doses, rather than relying on “an extremely precise, extremely elaborate and potentially resource-intensive approach to a problem that usually can be handled in a much more straightforward way.”

Horowitz sees his work with Outro as part of a larger mission to shift the public conversation about the root causes of psychological problems. While he doesn't want to discourage people who need medication from taking it, he believes that the level of chronic SSRI use happening today should be carefully evaluated to ensure social factors contributing to mental health issues are not being overlooked. “To me, it is actually a very leftist issue to de-medicalize the way we treat anxiety and depression,” he says, noting that such illnesses are often caused “by social circumstances, by poverty, by loneliness.”

Outro is making the opposite pitch of most online health startups, offering to help people stop drugs rather than start them. But its website doesn't look too different from that of other telehealth companies, featuring the same neutral colors and clean fonts that have come to define the world of direct-to-consumer millennial wellness brands. On its landing page, a chirpy pop-up appears advertising its introductory offer: “Get started for $99.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The UK Accelerates Its Self-Driving Car Ambitions","https://www.wired.com/story/uk-self-driving-car-ambitions-wayve-uber/","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 08:30:00 GMT","

Slow and steady. When it comes to autonomous vehicles on city roads, that's been the approach in most of the world's countries.

But on Tuesday, the UK announced it would put a cautious foot on the pedal, when the Department of Transport said it would accelerate plans to allow companies to operate self-driving cars on public roads in limited pilot programs starting spring of next year. The British government had initially planned to open up its roads for self-driving vehicles more than a year later, in the second half of 2027.

“We can see what a massive economic opportunity this technology presents,” Transport secretary Heidi Alexander tells WIRED in an interview. The department estimates the autonomous vehicle industry will create 38,000 jobs and generate 42 billion pounds ($57 million US) for the country by 2035. The secretary also cites better and more efficient travel options and road safety as motivators behind the country's new timeline. “We know how hard companies are working on issues related to safety, and we don't want to sit around waiting for this technology to develop further,” she says.

The pilot phase of the country's autonomous vehicle deployments will include a limited number of vehicles, says Transport Department spokesperson Marco Barbato, and the government will spend about a year studying the data those vehicles produce. The government aims to allow companies to fully launch autonomous taxi services in the second half of 2027.

Still, UK government officials say they will prioritize safety. “We won't allow this technology to be deployed on our roads unless we are confident that really rigorous safety tests have been met,” Alexander says.

Major transportation players appeared poised to take advantage of the government's announcement. The British autonomous vehicle developer Wayve and US ride-hail giant Uber said Tuesday that they would partner to take advantage of the government's new plan by launching autonomous vehicle trials on London roads.

London will be a tricky place to operate self-driving cars, Wayve CEO and cofounder Alex Kendall says. “This is not Phoenix, Arizona—it's not a grid-like city in the desert where the sun always shines,” he says. (Waymo began its self-driving taxi service in Phoenix.) London, by contrast, “is a medieval, structured environment. It has seven times more jaywalkers than San Francisco.” Launching service in London will help Wayve prove how ""scalable and trusted” its autonomous tech can be, he says. Kendall declined to say when Uber and Wayve might launch their service.

Wayve's various autonomous vehicles.

Wayve will become Uber's latest partner in its all-of-the-above approach to autonomous vehicle tech. Customers can use the Uber app to order an autonomous vehicle from the Google subsidiary Waymo in Austin, Texas, and soon, Atlanta, Georgia. Volkswagen subsidiary Moia said it aims to have thousands of self-driving vehicles operating on the Uber network in the next decade. Uber is working with Hyundai-linked robotaxi company Motional to test autonomous technology in Las Vegas, and has inked a deal with WeRide to bring autonomous vehicles to the UAE. And Uber has a nearly 25 percent stake in the autonomous trucking tech firm Aurora, after selling its own self-driving unit to the company in 2020.

“Our vision is to make autonomy a safe and reliable option for riders everywhere, and this trial in London brings that future closer to reality,” Uber president and COO Andrew Macdonald said in a written statement.

Several other companies are developing and planning to test autonomous vehicles in the UK, even before the government announced its accelerated timeline. Autonomous vehicle software developer Oxa has trialed its tech in Oxford and London, though plans to apply its tech to transit and industrial contexts, including mining and ports. (“We're everything but taxis and personal transport,” Oxa founder Paul Newman said recently.) The Israeli company Mobileye has tested collision avoidance technology on London buses. Another British firm, Birmingham-based Cognital, announced its liquidation due to “funding issues” earlier this year.

A handful of companies are experimenting with autonomous vehicle technologies in Europe, though none yet have the commercialized robotaxi services found in the US and China. But despite the UK's push, Uber and Wayve may not be alone in Europe for long. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the Chinese company Baidu is in talks to launch a robotaxi service in Switzerland.

Every couple of years, Bose and Sony trade blows in an effort to claim the title of the best noise-canceling headphones you can buy. Until recently, Bose's QuietComfort Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends) had the edge, offering world-crushing cancellation that bested Sony's still-great WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) and other top models from the likes of JBL, Sonos, and Apple.

Now, Sony's back with its latest WH-1000 model, the predictably titled WH-1000XM6 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). The new pair offers an almost startling armament of microphones and noise-cancellation tech, along with improved sound, style, and features. So can it claim the title? Let's dive into the details.

Starting with aesthetics, neither of these plastic-clad models stands out like Apple's iconic (and heavy) AirPods Max, but both manage to blaze their own trail to match premium pricing with a posh design.

Sony's XM6 gets a refreshed plastic matte exterior that feels both grittier and more robust than its predecessor. Along with extra style points, the new design rectifies one of the XM5's biggest detractions with a new hinge point along the arms that once again makes Sony's best wireless headphones foldable for travel. This leads to a more travel-friendly case, including a design refresh that swaps the zipper top for a convenient magnetic flap.

As for the all-important fit, the XM6 rely on thick padding and clamping force along the earcups to keep them secure, but the headband pad is surprisingly thin. The headphones are still comfortable for hours of wear, especially once you break them in, but the band tends to wear on my head more over time than the more lavishly appointed QC Ultra and other favorites like the JBL Tour Pro M3.

Bose's pair applies more glitz than the understated XM6, highlighted by sleek curves, a more sumptuous protein leather coating along the pads, and speckled metallic armpieces that grip smaller earcups. Like the XM6, the Ultra fold easily for travel, and their smaller size translates to a slightly more compact case. Though you'll miss out on the zipperless lid, when it comes to a more premium look and fit, Bose's pair takes this category.

WIRED: Bose QuietComfort Ultra

Both pairs are loaded with flagship features, including conveniences like multipoint pairing, auto-pause sensors, and replaceable earpads. Each model includes a loaded app for tinkering and customizing features like adaptive noise canceling and transparency modes, among multiple other parameters, and both opt for analog audio input rather than USB-C playback from their charging ports.

Bose has its specialties, including a more accessible and intuitive app layout. Sony's app is more complicated but also provides more ways to explore and adapt, like a multiband EQ that goes well beyond Bose's three-band version. You'll also get Sony stalwarts like the ability to hold the right earcup to temporarily activate exterior sounds.

You might even say Sony goes a little overboard on the feature front, but as we've come to expect, the XM6 keep the most important stuff up front, embodied by the best control system on the market. Simply double tap the right earcup for play/pause, swipe up or down to raise or lower volume, and forward or backward for song skip. Dedicated power and ambient audio keys on the left earcup complete the layout for a remarkably intuitive and responsive experience.

Bose's QC Ultra pack their own control innovations, including a handy new volume slider pad that's accurate enough to dial in your levels without blasting your ears. The other controls are less convenient due to their reliance on a two-button solution that puts a lot of weight on the multi-key. The main drawback is the need to hold the key down to laboriously cycle through ambient sound modes, compared to Sony's dedicated key that cycles with a quick tap.

It's not a massive difference, but Sony's mix of simpler controls and deeper, more granular features gives its pair a leg up in usability.

WIRED: Sony WH-1000XM6

Before digging in here, it's important to note that both of these pairs offer noise canceling that bests everything we've ever tested. If you need to kill the noise, either pair will do so to an almost disorienting level.

With a total of 12 microphones and an advanced new chipset, Sony claims its latest headphones have the best noise canceling on the market. When A/B testing without music, this was difficult to prove. Both are fantastic at removing low-end sounds like my go-to Airplane drone video, while effectively quelling high-register sounds like keystrokes, vacuums, and vocal chatter.

What's immediately obvious is how much faster the XM6 works to kill sound, giving them an edge in some key areas. Sony claims its new QN3 processor is “7X faster” than the previous pair's QN1 chip, which translates to crazy-quick response to your environment. Where Bose's pair slowly squashes noises as it analyzes them over time, the XM6 react almost instantly to everything from passing cars to my electric leaf blower.

As Wired editor Parker Hall pointed out, the XM6's faster response time also aids their noise canceling in the way most people listen, with music playing, by adjusting the output in real time with your tunes. In testing with light music playing, Sony's pair did seem to offer a slight advantage over the Ultra, especially with sharper annoyances like my ever-vigilant barking dog. Even so, both pairs are so powerful that a little music puts you in the void from virtually all sounds anyway.

Transparency mode, the diametric opposite of noise canceling, is similarly close, but again, Sony's faster response time enhances performance. Both pairs sound quite natural, but Sony's model reacted more effectively in real time to punchy sounds like the slamming of my back door or a loud clap, while Bose's pair takes longer to adapt. Sony's blazingly fast silicon seems to be the real secret to the XM6's incredible ambient audio skills.

WIRED: Sony WH-1000XM6

This is the other key area in which Sony holds an advantage, offering some of the best sound in the genre. To their credit, the QC Ultra are the best sounding Bose headphones I've tested, serving up impressive balance, clarity, and vibrancy. You'll find marked sensitivity and precision in the midrange and treble that evoke keen instrumental timbres and tight separation across the stereo image. Bass is mildly boomy by default but is easily tamed in the EQ.

For those who enjoy it, Bose's pair holds a slight advantage for spatial audio. Both models offer 3D upmixing for more immersive listening with available head-tracking, which keeps your music centered as though listening to a pair of speakers, but Sony's head-tracking is limited to Android devices only, while Bose's pair works for either device type.

For stereo playback, Sony's XM6 provides a warmer overall sound signature that still takes care with the higher frequencies, allowing for more intimacy, breadth, and instrumental textures that burst through the mix. Horns, woodwinds, and percussion are particularly gorgeous, with a lyrical, sometimes flinty brilliance that always steers clear of sharpness.

The XM6's bass response is just as impressive. It's taut and poised while still letting loose with some extra thump that blends studio-style precision with some playful buzz and grit. Rolling through the latest Andy Shauf project, Foxwarren 2, I was wholly enamored with the array of synth and percussion sounds, from the bouncy groove in “Deadhead” to the sawtoothed grind of “Havana.”

Both models offer sound quality worthy of their price tags, but Sony's deeper dive into the details hooked me in the first few minutes and never let go.

WIRED: Sony WH-1000XM6

Both pairs fared well across a number of calls between friends and colleagues. It's always hard to judge calling accurately given factors like crappy Zoom calls or dodgy cell connections, but I had no trouble with either pair on my end, and everyone I talked to said they could hear me clearly, even in crowded areas.

WIRED: Tie

Another slight strength for Sony, you'll get a max of around 30 hours of playback with noise canceling, just like the XM5, while Bose's pair offers a max of 24 hours with ambient modes engaged. It's worth noting that plenty of cheaper pairs provide more, but either number is plenty for all applications.

WIRED: Sony WH-1000XM6

The answer here may seem obvious, with Sony's WH-1000XM6 taking more categories. For my money, their mix of great usability, improved sound quality, and instantly vaporizing noise cancellation makes them the wireless headphones to beat.

Still, there's a good argument for Bose's QC Ultra, particularly for long-haul travelers. With better comfort, great sound, and similarly fabulous noise canceling, they remain top contenders. They also debuted at a lower price (though it's now in line with Sony on Bose's site) and can often be found on sale.

Either way, you're getting insanely good noise canceling that bests everything else we've tested. Win-win!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Tesla's Robotaxis Are Rolling Out Soon—With One Big Unanswered Question","https://www.wired.com/story/as-robotaxi-rides-begin-we-still-dont-know-the-mystery-of-teslas-human-helpers/","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Self-driving vehicle developers don't usually love talking about “teleoperation”—when a human guides or drives robot cars remotely. It can feel like a dirty secret. Shouldn't an autonomous vehicle operate, well, autonomously?

But experts say teleoperations are, at least right now, a critical part of any robot taxi service, including Tesla's Robotaxi. The tech, though impressive, is still in development, and the autonomous systems still need humans to guide them through less-common and especially sticky road situations. Plus, a bedrock principle of safety engineering is that every system needs a backup—doubly so for new robotic ones that involve two-ton EVs driving themselves on public roads.

And yet, just days out from Tesla's launch of its long-awaited (and much delayed) Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, the public still doesn't know much at all about its teleoperations systems. Tesla has posted a job related to teleoperations that states the role will be responsible for developing the application ""that our Remote Operators use to interface with our cars and robots,” an application where these operators will be “transported into the device's world using a state-of-the-art VR rig that allows them to remotely perform complex and intricate tasks.”

Alarmingly, several government spokespeople—representing the city of Austin, the state of Texas, and the US's top road safety regulator—didn't respond to questions about Tesla's teleoperations. Indeed, Austin and the Texas Department of Transportation referred all our questions about Tesla technology to the company itself. Tesla, which disbanded its public relations team in 2020, didn't respond to WIRED's questions.

Last month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the country's road safety watchdog, wrote a letter to Tesla posing questions about, among other things, how or if Tesla planned to use teleoperations. How will its human staff be expected to monitor, supervise, or even intervene when its systems are on the road? The government asked the company to respond by June 19, which will be after the service supposedly launches on June 12, according to reporting from Bloomberg earlier this month. NHTSA repeatedly would not respond to WIRED's inquiries into what it knows about Tesla's teleoperations.

The Los Angeles Times reported that humans used teleoperations to manipulate the robot Optimus during a “Cybercab” debut event in Los Angeles, and when Optimus showed off its new hands a month later, catching a tennis ball in mid-air, an engineer for the company acknowledged that humans similarly used teleoperations. The company also has a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California with a driver behind the wheel. The state has much stricter rules than Texas and requires some kind of “communication link” between testing vehicles and remote operators, so it's likely the company has some kind of system.

While not shedding any light on exactly how Tesla's teleoperations will work in the city, Austin Transportation and Public Works spokesperson Cristal Corrales wrote in an email: “The City works with AV [autonomous vehicle] companies before and during deployment to obtain training for first responders, establish expectations for ongoing communication and share information about infrastructure and events.” Texas Department of Transportation spokesperson Laura Butterbrodt said in an emailed statement: “Texas law allows for AV testing and operations on Texas roadways as long as they meet the same safety and insurance requirements as every other vehicle on the road.”

Bedeviling this Robotaxi mystery is the fact that the autonomous vehicle industry hasn't coalesced around a definition for “teleoperations.” So as Tesla watchers await the Austin service, it's worth understanding a bit more about these teleoperations, and how they work.

It's worth defining some terms. What self-driving-car developers usually call “remote operations” refer to a few different sorts of human jobs. There are, first, the operators who deal with other humans. These are people trained to interact with autonomous taxi riders when they have questions or need assistance in an emergency. Alphabet's Waymo, the undisputed leader in self-driving, has a big Support button on its in-car passenger screens, which can connect riders with these folks. These operators can also be people trained to interact with law enforcement or emergency responders when they need assistance.

Then there are operators who deal with the autonomous system. Some of these people may work in “remote assistance.” More confusion: Self-driving car developers give these tasks different names and titles. Amazon subsidiary Zoox uses “teleguidance”; the self-driving-truck developers at Aurora like “teleassistance”; Tesla appears to stick to “teleoperation”; Waymo calls these workers “fleet response agents.” Whatever they're called, these humans are meant to guide the autonomous system when it needs help. A car might alert people, for example, when it has encountered a roadblock, like construction equipment; the remote assistant might suggest a lane change or a turn or even a quick dip onto a road's shoulder to get around it.

These human assistants can also sometimes reroute an autonomous vehicle if its planned itinerary no longer makes sense—maybe a road is unexpectedly closed off for a street fair. They can also sometimes help the car identify objects that have, for whatever reason, confused its sensors: a plastic bag flapping in the wind or a traffic light (red or green?).

Remote assistance should be a part of every safe self-driving-vehicle program, says Philip Koopman, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies autonomous vehicle safety. “The technology is not there for them to be able to handle everything, and that's OK,” he says. Having humans operate in the background of autonomous systems, then, isn't “cheating” at self-driving. It's understanding the limits of today's technology—and what it takes to run a profitable business based on self-driving cars.

Still, some remote assistance programs are safer than others, Koopman says. Some of that comes down to “triggers,” or how the system knows it needs help and turns to its human overlords. Is it the human assistant's job to notice that the vehicle is stuck—or about to smash into something? Or is the onus on the vehicle to ask for aid? The safer bet, he says, is to train the technology to know when it needs intervention rather than relying on the vigilance of the human auxiliaries.

Asking for help can be very hard for people—but it might be harder for robots. That's because autonomous systems must automatically provide the humans with everything they need to know to assist: what happened, where the vehicle is in space, and if there's anything around it. Only then can the humans guide the robots.

If that sounds tough, even tougher—and more controversial—is “remote driving.” This is what most people probably think of when they hear “teleoperations”: Someone far away from the supposed self-driving car, behind their own steering wheel or joystick, piloting it like a long-distance RC car.

Remote driving has even more technical challenges. Ben Shukman should know—as an engineer at a startup called Phantom Auto that focused on remote driving, he believes he was the first to do it on public roads. The first issue is connectivity. “Your ability to drive a car without being in the car is only as stable as the internet connection that connects you to it,” he says.

But anyone who has called a friend on a long drive knows that networks drop in and out as you move in space. There are technical ways to knit together networks, but those aren't foolproof. This leads to big issues with latency. So imagine the worst-case scenario: A robot car needs help navigating around an accident on a highway, a remote driver gets it moving, and then … the connection dies.

Another challenge in remote driving: Helping drivers understand the experience of driving without actually being in the car. It's hard to understand how quickly the momentum is shifting, or how hard you're braking if you're not inside the car. Shukman says it's possible to build a user interface that gives remote drivers a sense of what it's like on the road, but this takes thought and time.

For these reasons, Shukman says, remote driving is less than safe in environments where vehicles are moving quickly in unpredictable environments, even above a handful of miles per hour. Today, the technique is mostly used in public to get delivery robots out of jams. Those move so slowly that a few milliseconds of dropped connection likely won't spell disaster. The startup where he worked, Phantom Auto, eventually pivoted to operating forklifts remotely in warehouse settings. (It shut down last year, but its founders are sticking with its thesis: Their new startup keeps humans “in the loop” by building a platform that allows people to easily intervene to help in AI search.)

If Tesla does make good on its promise to start its Robotaxi service in Austin this month, how will it handle teleoperations? A Morgan Stanley research note from its head of global autos and shared mobility research Adam Jonas claims the service will be heavily teleoperated, though Tesla has not confirmed any of this.

The job posting for software engineers working in teleoperation on “Optimus & Robotaxi” explicitly says the company's remote operators will be “transported into the device's world using a state-of-the-art VR rig” that will supposedly let them remotely execute intricate tasks requiring some form of human involvement. This sounds more like remote driving—direct intervention with the driving task—than remote assistance.

If Tesla's remote operators are meant to closely monitor its Robotaxis' systems, “I think it's going to be very difficult to expand beyond a few vehicles and a small area,” says Koopman, the professor. Or at least, to do it safely.

In fact, that's what CEO Elon Musk has said—that Tesla's Robotaxi launch will start with just 10 to 20 cars and will expand from there. Maybe there will be some robots. But the better questions are what the humans supporting them will be doing—and whether they'll be doing it safely.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said today that the company's social network Threads will finally begin testing a DM (direct message) inbox that's separate from users' Instagram DM Inboxes. This means Threads users won't have to use Instagram or switch apps to chat with someone on the platform.

The company will initially test this feature in limited geographies, including Hong Kong, Thailand, and Argentina, with plans to roll it out in other locations soon. The chat feature is currently limited to one-on-one conversations, not group messages. 

This will likely be seen as a positive development for Meta's newest social network. As TechCrunch previously noted, many people have a different set of followers on Threads than they do on Instagram. Plus, there's a chance that some number of Threads users don't often use their Instagram accounts, if they use the app at all.

Instagram has been thinking of how to approach Threads DMs for some time. 

Last year, the company was working on a prototype that allowed users to send a message to their Instagram inbox directly from the Threads app.

In 2023, Instagram head Adam Mosseri also said that the social network hoped to make the Instagram inbox work for Threads. His thinking at the time was that people have similar followings on both social networks, which is not always true.

When Threads debuted in July 2023, it was heavily dependent on Instagram's network effects, with features that immediately connected Instagram users with their friends and other creators. But after more than 20 months of existence, the company realized that people were forming different kinds of networks on Threads, due to its public nature and similarities with other short-form apps like X and Bluesky. 

Meta said that it decided to create a separate DM inbox feature because Threads users were asking for a way to have one-on-one conversations without having to switch apps.

While it's good that Threads finally made a DM inbox available, the company is late in rolling it out. 

Its rival social network Bluesky introduced DMs in May 2024. Meta's announcement also comes just a few days after Elon Musk-owned X released a new XChat feature with support for group messages, vanishing mode, and file sharing, to improve on DMs.

Google's AI Overviews and other AI-powered tools, including chatbots, are devastating traffic for news publishers, per a Wall Street Journal report. 

Now that people can simply ask a chatbot for answers — sometimes generated from news content taken without a publisher's knowledge — there's no need to click on Google's blue links. That means referrals to news sites are plummeting, cutting off the traffic publishers need to sustain quality journalism. 

Google released AI Overviews, its search result summary tool, last year. Its rollout hit traffic to sites like vacation guides, health tips, and product reviews, per the Journal. AI Mode, Google's ChatGPT competitor, is expected to hit traffic harder. It responds in a conversational tone with fewer external links.

For The New York Times, the share of traffic from organic search to the paper's desktop and mobile sites fell to 36.5% in April 2025, down from 44% three years earlier, according to data from Similarweb cited in The Wall Street Journal report.

Google likes to tell a different story. During Google's developer conference in May, the company said its AI Overviews feature has boosted search traffic — though maybe not for publishers. 

Publishers like The Atlantic and The Washington Post have spoken about the need for the industry to shift business models, and fast, to combat this threat to journalism. Some have resorted to doing content-sharing deals with AI companies for additional revenue streams. 

The Times most recently inked a deal with Amazon to license its editorial content to train the tech giant's AI platforms. Several publishers, including The Atlantic, have signed on to work with OpenAI. AI startup Perplexity's plan is to share advertising revenue with news publishers when its chatbot surfaces their content in response to a query.

Dutch payments firm Adyen now has a market cap of over $61 billion, but that didn't stop its co-founder Arnout Schuijff from stepping down in 2021 to focus on his new startup, Tebi.

Now an Amsterdam-based fintech startup with 35 employees, Tebi helps restaurants, bars and other hospitality businesses manage their operations with an all-in-one subscription-based platform that can handle payments, reservations, inventory, and more.

This means that Tebi has a wealth of competitors, from POS systems to reservation platforms and analytics-driven solutions for inventory optimization. But it hopes to have an advantage by tying this all together with enterprise-level functionalities and pricing.

To a casual observer, this appears as something that Adyen could have done. But given its focus on enterprise, building a product for SMBs was better done on the outside, Schuijff said. “That was a much more logical step for me than to try and do it within the context of Adyen.”

However, Tebi wasn't meant to fill a gap left by Adyen. Nor was it meant to find a new role for Schuijff, who had stayed in his CTO role after the 2018 IPO that made him a billionaire, at least on paper. “My move was really a positive one. I didn't need to go. I was still enjoying my job,” he recalled. 

What he was missing, though, was coding; and this impulse to code was how Tebi was born. During COVID lockdown, Schuijff decided to revisit his attempt to make it easier for his favorite bar to handle value-added tax (VAT) and other reporting hassles.

On a tech level, this was similar to the accounting platform he built for Adyen, and before that, for Bibit, which then RBS-owned Worldpay acquired in 2004. But by 2020, Schuijff had more tools at his disposal. Using streaming, he was able to support instant transaction updates — and it grabbed him.

While this isn't the case in the Netherlands yet, “you see a move towards tax departments requiring hospitality businesses to report instantly when the sale is happening,” Schuijff said. But more generally, he saw the need for less manual reconciliation work. This was also confirmed to him by bar owner Mazdak Nasori, who became one of Tebi's five co-founders.

Eventually, Schuijff told Adyen CEO Pieter van der Does he would leave to focus on Tebi full-time. But his goal wasn't to build another Bibit or Adyen, and still isn't. “It was just that I got so inspired by the coding and by the opportunity to contribute something to society in another way by helping out a lot of local business owners,” Schuijff told TechCrunch.

As Tebi's CEO, Schuijff's role doesn't involve much programming, and the irony isn't lost on him. “I miss doing the coding, but then I figured out that I could add more value and increase the success chances of Tebi by actually doing what a CEO is supposed to be doing, which is building the team and many other aspects, helping with the strategy and all these things.” 

One of these things is sales. When he goes out to eat or have a drink, Schuijff can't help talking to owners about their pain points, checking what they are using, and introducing Tebi. “I consider I am doing them a favor, almost,” he laughed.

Still, joining forces with former Adyen EVP of Technology Rob Vonk as Tebi's CTO made for a tech-heavy team that needed balancing, Schuijff said. So he also hired Aki Tas as COO, who was formerly head of business strategy and operations at Notion, and recruited Patrick Studener, formerly COO at Wolt, as CCO. “Now we managed to level out the boat and start focusing much more on the commercial side and the expansion side.”

After using a hyperlocal deployment approach Tebi is now available across the Netherlands, where it says merchants are already processing nine figures of payments annually on the platform. With open roles in Amsterdam and London and plans to double its headcount by the end of the year, its next step is to start serving the U.K. market, followed by “many countries in the coming years,” Schuijff said.

This rollout will be supported by funding. Eight months after raising a €20 million Series A led by Index Ventures (approximately $22 million), Tebi has now closed a €30 million investment (approximately $34 million.) Led by CapitalG, Google parent Alphabet's growth fund, with participation from Index, it brings its total funding to €56 million (about $64 million).

Although San Francisco-based, CapitalG partner Alex Nichols is a really thesis-driven investor who also has Europe on his radar. He recently led a deal into Belgian startup Odoo, which joined a portfolio that already includes Monzo and Pennylane. He sought out Tebi after observing that European SMBs are underserved by costly, bank-dominated payment solutions. 

“This setup closely resembles the U.S. market 15 years ago before the rise of software-embedded payments reduced bank share to less than 30%” he told TechCrunch in a written comment.

That Nichols had done his research was what ultimately won CapitalG the deal, in addition to all the “touch points” between Tebi and Alphabet properties such as Android, Gemini, Google Cloud, and Google Maps. “We were not looking for an investment, but we thought, yeah, they're bringing much more than just money,” Schuijff said.

The money in question will fund more than Tebi's international expansion. It will also let it add more AI features, in addition to what it already implemented for onboarding to automatically pull menu, visual identity, and reservation settings. “The future vision,” Schuijff said, is that on top of its all-in-one platform, there will be “an AI platform that will help you run your business better.”

Building this vision and expanding across Europe will take Tebi's bandwidth for a while. But after that, and “as soon as we are confident that we can grab a significant part of the market there,” a U.S. expansion is in the cards.

U.S. grocery distribution giant United Natural Foods (UNFI) said on Tuesday it is working to restore its capabilities following a cyberattack last week that continues to disrupt the grocery supply chain. 

UNFI said as part of its third-quarter earnings report that it was “diligently managing through the cyber incident” it confirmed on Monday. The company is “helping our customers with short-term solutions wherever possible,” said UNFI chief executive Sandy Douglas in prepared remarks.

On the company's post-results conference call, Douglas said UNFI is “continuing to safely bring our systems back online and restore broad-based customer service as soon as possible.”

The company, which is the primary distributor for Amazon-owned Whole Foods, and supplies over 250,000 grocery store products, including frozen goods, disclosed on Monday that it had identified unauthorized access to its IT systems. Douglas said on its call Tuesday that the company has since shut down its entire network.

The company has not described the nature of the cyberattack, but it said the intrusion was causing ongoing disruptions to its operations, including its ability to fulfill and distribute customer orders.

Douglas told investors on the call that the company was shipping to customers “on a limited basis.”

One customer of UNFI told TechCrunch that they are trialing a new product in Whole Foods stores this week, but said much of their supply had not been delivered. The customer said they have heard nothing from either UNFI or Whole Foods about the disruption. 

TechCrunch has heard anecdotal reports of diminished or empty shelves at some stores affected by the disruption at UNFI, but it is not immediately clear if this is due to the cyberattack or other supply chain issues. Much of the downstream real-world impact on grocery stores and their customers may not be seen until later this week.

Whole Foods has not returned a request for comment from TechCrunch. Reuters cited a Whole Foods spokesperson as saying that the retail giant was “working to restock our shelves as quickly as possible” and referred additional questions back to UNFI.

It's not clear how much UNFI has spent on cybersecurity, nor who is ultimately responsible for cybersecurity at the company. 

A spokesperson for UNFI did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by TechCrunch on Tuesday.

Much of the UNFI's external-facing systems are offline, including web systems used by suppliers and customers, as well as the company's VPN products, according to checks by TechCrunch.

UNFI reported $8.1 billion in net sales in the quarter ended May 3, 2025. The company said it was expecting to report a loss on net income and earnings per share for its 2025 outlook following the ending of a contract with a grocery store chain's operations in the U.S. northeast, but that it is not adjusting its outlook at this time due to the “ongoing assessment” of the cyberattack.

It's probably a legit complaint, but still potentially the fault of Microsoft.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","IBM aims to build the world's first large-scale, error-corrected quantum computer by 2028","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/10/1118297/ibm-large-scale-error-corrected-quantum-computer-by-2028/","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

The company says it has cracked the code for error correction and is building a modular machine in New York state.

IBM announced detailed plans today to build an error-corrected quantum computer with significantly more computational capability than existing machines by 2028. It hopes to make the computer available to users via the cloud by 2029. 

The proposed machine, named Starling, will consist of a network of modules, each of which contains a set of chips, housed within a new data center in Poughkeepsie, New York. “We've already started building the space,” says Jay Gambetta, vice president of IBM's quantum initiative.

IBM claims Starling will be a leap forward in quantum computing. In particular, the company aims for it to be the first large-scale machine to implement error correction. If Starling achieves this, IBM will have solved arguably the biggest technical hurdle facing the industry today to beat competitors including Google, Amazon Web Services, and smaller startups such as Boston-based QuEra and PsiQuantum of Palo Alto, California. 

Rapid advances in applying artificial intelligence to simulations in physics and chemistry have some people questioning whether we will even need quantum computers at all.

IBM, along with the rest of the industry, has years of work ahead. But Gambetta thinks it has an edge because it has all the building blocks to build error correction capabilities in a large-scale machine. That means improvements in everything from algorithm development to chip packaging. “We've cracked the code for quantum error correction, and now we've moved from science to engineering,” he says. 

Correcting errors in a quantum computer has been an engineering challenge, owing to the unique way the machines crunch numbers. Whereas classical computers encode information in the form of bits, or binary 1 and 0, quantum computers instead use qubits, which can represent “superpositions” of both values at once. IBM builds qubits made of tiny superconducting circuits, kept near absolute zero, in an interconnected layout on chips. Other companies have built qubits out of other materials, including neutral atoms, ions, and photons.

Quantum computers sometimes commit errors, such as when the hardware operates on one qubit but accidentally also alters a neighboring qubit that should not be involved in the computation. These errors add up over time. Without error correction, quantum computers cannot accurately perform the complex algorithms that are expected to be the source of their scientific or commercial value, such as extremely precise chemistry simulations for discovering new materials and pharmaceutical drugs. 

But error correction requires significant hardware overhead. Instead of encoding a single unit of information in a single “physical” qubit, error correction algorithms encode a unit of information in a constellation of physical qubits, referred to collectively as a “logical qubit.” 

AI can help discover new materials, but we'll need quantum computers to really move the needle.

Currently, quantum computing researchers are competing to develop the best error correction scheme. Google's surface code algorithm, while effective at correcting errors, requires on the order of 100 qubits to store a single logical qubit in memory. AWS's Ocelot quantum computer uses a more efficient error correction scheme that requires nine physical qubits per logical qubit in memory. (The overhead is higher for qubits performing computations for storing data.) IBM's error correction algorithm, known as a low-density parity check code, will make it possible to use 12 physical qubits per logical qubit in memory, a ratio comparable to AWS's. 

One distinguishing characteristic of Starling's design will be its anticipated ability to diagnose errors, known as decoding, in real time. Decoding involves determining whether a measured signal from the quantum computer corresponds to an error. IBM has developed a decoding algorithm that can be quickly executed by a type of conventional chip known as an FPGA. This work bolsters the “credibility” of IBM's error correction method, says Neil Gillespie of the UK-based quantum computing startup Riverlane. 

However, other error correction schemes and hardware designs aren't out of the running yet. “It's still not clear what the winning architecture is going to be,” says Gillespie. 

IBM intends Starling to be able to perform computational tasks beyond the capability of classical computers. Starling will have 200 logical qubits, which will be constructed using the company's chips. It should be able to perform 100 million logical operations consecutively with accuracy; existing quantum computers can do so for only a few thousand. 

The system will demonstrate error correction at a much larger scale than anything done before, claims Gambetta. Previous error correction demonstrations, such as those done by Google and Amazon, involve a single logical qubit, built from a single chip. Gambetta calls them “gadget experiments,” saying “They're small-scale.” 

Still, it's unclear whether Starling will be able to solve practical problems. Some experts think that you need a billion error-corrected logical operations to execute any useful algorithm. Starling represents “an interesting stepping-stone regime,” says Wolfgang Pfaff, a physicist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. “But it's unlikely that this will generate economic value.” (Pfaff, who studies quantum computing hardware, has received research funding from IBM but is not involved with Starling.) 

The timeline for Starling looks feasible, according to Pfaff. The design is “based in experimental and engineering reality,” he says. “They've come up with something that looks pretty compelling.” But building a quantum computer is hard, and it's possible that IBM will encounter delays due to unforeseen technical complications. “This is the first time someone's doing this,” he says of making a large-scale error-corrected quantum computer.

IBM's road map involves first building smaller machines before Starling. This year, it plans to demonstrate that error-corrected information can be stored robustly in a chip called Loon. Next year the company will build Kookaburra, a module that can both store information and perform computations. By the end of 2027, it plans to connect two Kookaburra-type modules together into a larger quantum computer, Cockatoo. After demonstrating that successfully, the next step is to scale up and connect around 100 modules to create Starling.

This strategy, says Pfaff, reflects the industry's recent embrace of “modularity” when scaling up quantum computers—networking multiple modules together to create a larger quantum computer rather than laying out qubits on a single chip, as researchers did in earlier designs. 

IBM is also looking beyond 2029. After Starling, it plans to build another, Blue Jay. (“I like birds,” says Gambetta.) Blue Jay will contain 2000 logical qubits and is expected to be capable of a billion logical operations. 

The emissions from individual AI text, image, and video queries seem small—until you add up what the industry isn't tracking and consider where it's heading next.

Pigs whose DNA makes them resistant to a virus could be the first big consumer product using gene editing.

A thorium-fueled reactor is the latest idea being revived after getting shelved in the mid-20th century.

The tech behemoth is betting that planting millions of eucalyptus trees in Brazil will be the path to a greener future. Some ecologists and local residents are far less sure.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","The Pentagon is gutting the team that tests AI and weapons systems","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/10/1118229/pentagon-gutting-ai-test/","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

The move is a boon to ‘AI for defense' companies that want an even faster road to adoption. 

The Trump administration's chainsaw approach to federal spending lives on, even as Elon Musk turns on the president. On May 28, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced he'd be gutting a key office at the Department of Defense responsible for testing and evaluating the safety of weapons and AI systems.

As part of a string of moves aimed at “reducing bloated bureaucracy and wasteful spending in favor of increased lethality,” Hegseth cut the size of the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation in half. The group was established in the 1980s—following orders from Congress—after criticisms that the Pentagon was fielding weapons and systems that didn't perform as safely or effectively as advertised. Hegseth is reducing the agency's staff to about 45, down from 94, and firing and replacing its director. He gave the office just seven days to implement the changes.

It is a significant overhaul of a department that in 40 years has never before been placed so squarely on the chopping block. Here's how today's defense tech companies, which have fostered close connections to the Trump administration, stand to gain, and why safety testing might suffer as a result. 

The Operational Test and Evaluation office is “the last gate before a technology gets to the field,” says Missy Cummings, a former fighter pilot for the US Navy who is now a professor of engineering and computer science at George Mason University. Though the military can do small experiments with new systems without running it by the office, it has to test anything that gets fielded at scale.

“In a bipartisan way—up until now—everybody has seen it's working to help reduce waste, fraud, and abuse,” she says. That's because it provides an independent check on companies' and contractors' claims about how well their technology works. It also aims to expose the systems to more rigorous safety testing.

The gutting comes at a particularly pivotal time for AI and military adoption: The Pentagon is experimenting with putting AI into everything, mainstream companies like OpenAI are now more comfortable working with the military, and defense giants like Anduril are winning big contracts to launch AI systems (last Thursday, Anduril announced a whopping $2.5 billion funding round, doubling its valuation to over $30 billion). 

Hegseth claims his cuts will “make testing and fielding weapons more efficient,” saving $300 million. But Cummings is concerned that they are paving a way to faster adoption while increasing the chances that new systems won't be as safe or effective as promised. “The firings in DOTE send a clear message that all perceived obstacles for companies favored by Trump are going to be removed,” she says.

Anduril and Anthropic, which have launched AI applications for military use, did not respond to my questions about whether they pushed for or approve of the cuts. A representative for OpenAI said that the company was not involved in lobbying for the restructuring. 

“The cuts make me nervous,” says Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who previously worked at the Pentagon in collaboration with the testing office. “It's not that we'll go from effective to ineffective, but you might not catch some of the problems that would surface in combat without this testing step.”

It's hard to say precisely how the cuts will affect the office's ability to test systems, and Cancian admits that those responsible for getting new technologies out onto the battlefield sometimes complain that it can really slow down adoption. But still, he says, the office frequently uncovers errors that weren't previously caught.

It's an especially important step, Cancian says, whenever the military is adopting a new type of technology like generative AI. Systems that might perform well in a lab setting almost always encounter new challenges in more realistic scenarios, and the Operational Test and Evaluation group is where that rubber meets the road.

So what to make of all this? It's true that the military was experimenting with artificial intelligence long before the current AI boom, particularly with computer vision for drone feeds, and defense tech companies have been winning big contracts for this push across multiple presidential administrations. But this era is different. The Pentagon is announcing ambitious pilots specifically for large language models, a relatively nascent technology that by its very nature produces hallucinations and errors, and it appears eager to put much-hyped AI into everything. The key independent group dedicated to evaluating the accuracy of these new and complex systems now only has half the staff to do it. I'm not sure that's a win for anyone.

Adoption of the tech has civil liberties advocates alarmed, especially as the government vows to expand surveillance of protesters and students.

AlphaEvolve uses large language models to find new algorithms that outperform the best human-made solutions for data center management, chip design, and more.

In a test run, a unit of Marines in the Pacific used generative AI not just to collect intelligence but to interpret it. Routine intel work is only the start.

In 2019, Karen Hao, a senior reporter with MIT Technology Review, pitched writing a story about a then little-known company, OpenAI. This is what happened next.

Great news for fans of Godzilla Minus One: the chonky kaiju icon from Takashi Yamazaki's Academy Award-winning feature will finally be released in Funko Pop form.

io9 has the exclusive first look at the Godzilla Minus One figure, which will debut at Anime Expo 2025.

The Big G's U.S. counterpart series from Legendary got a run of Funkos timed to Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, but Godzilla Minus One was left out until now. At last, the version of Godzilla seen in Toho's hit international film will join the Funko toy market this summer, giving collectors something to add to their Godzilla Minus One displays alongside Super 7's incredibly articulated statues, one in color and another in black and white, which we loved.

Here's the reveal of the Funko from the Super Pop! Collection.

The vinyl collectible features the iconic Toho monster and showcases his formidable presence inspired by Yamazaki's take on Godzilla. It stands approximately 5.4 inches (13.7 cm) tall, alongside the rest of the kaiju's various Funko forms from all his other universes of media. Can't wait to see it next to the 70th anniversary jumbo Pop figure, which stands 10 inches tall.

This release also features a new form of authentication, with a special sticker on the box that's unique and cannot be replicated. No false Godzillas need apply!

The Funko Pop Super Godzilla Minus One figure will first be available for purchase (retail price is $20) at the Funko booth during Anime Expo 2025 in Los Angeles, starting at 9 a.m. PT on July 3. It will also be available online in the future (date TBD) on Funko's website.

An international TV spot gives us a glimmer of new Superman footage. Riri Williams makes a tough choice in a new clip from Ironheart. Plus, Ralph Macchio teases the future of the ‘Karate Kid' universe. Spoilers now!



 

During a recent interview with Variety, Amanda Seyfried confirmed to co-star Adam Brody there are plans in place for a new Jennifer's Body.

Seyfried: We're making another [Jennifer's Body]. Are you going to do it?

Brody: I heard. I wasn't contacted. I died [in the first one].

Seyfried: So did Megan Fox, and I'm not doing it without her.

Speaking with Newport Beach TV Fest (via Screen Rant), Ralph Macchio stated “the Miyagiverse is infinite” and Cobra Kai showrunners Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg] are “working on some conceptual ideas” for new projects.

Oh yeah, I'm gonna tell you right now. Only that there's dialogue that's going on. Until you have the green light, and you're making it, it's probably not the right thing to tease. But there are those areas – I know the guys [Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg] are working on some conceptual ideas – and two things that we know: The Miyagiverse is infinite and Cobra Kai Never Dies. So we'll see, and then outside of that, there are other places to – I can't drop the news fully, but we're working on it. We're working on it.

A recent news report from Fox 5 San Diego included behind-the-scenes footage from the new Killer Tomatoes movie as filming wrapped in Chula Vista, California. Click through to have a look.

Cat Grant gossips with Lois Lane in the latest international Superman TV spot.

A woman stranded in the remote wilds of Northern Georgia (Ella Balinska) is aided by a disembodied Rob Delaney who may-or-may-not actually exist in the trailer for The Occupant.

Elsewhere, Whitney Peak (The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) discovers an entity named Mr. Sandman ate her grandmother's eyeballs in the trailer for Eye for an Eye, co-starring S. Epatha Merkerson.

According to Variety, Disney has officially acquired the rights to Miraculous Stellar Force, a new anime series based on Miraculous – Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir. Said to be “set at an international school in the Japanese capital,” the series follows “12 students who discover they are guardians of the Stellar Matrix, a fractured ancient cosmic weapon. Under the leadership of Miki, Mayotte and Yu Lu, these heroes must overcome personal differences and chaotic friendships to face formidable galactic villains such as the revenge-driven Modeler and the ominous force known as The Supreme.”

Finally, Riri Williams sells her soul (metaphorically…so far) to do something “iconic” in a new clip from Ironheart.

Portable power stations have gained immense popularity in winter as they provide reliable backup power during a power outage within the home. However, the applications of these power stations do not just end at the cold season: In summer, the useful applications of these power stations stand out by providing essential power to camping events, outdoor gatherings, and every off-grid adventure.

Among the many brands in this space, DJI (widely recognized for its drones and cameras) has established itself as a serious contender in the portable power station market. The DJI Power 1000 portable power station is currently available on Amazon at an all-time low price of $449 which is a huge 55% discount from its original list price of $999. This limited-time deal has already seen 10% of the stock sold, highlighting strong demand for this powerful and feature-rich device.

See at Amazon

The DJI Power 1000 packs a robust 1024Wh LiFePO4 battery which delivers 2200W of continuous power with a peak output of 2600W. This makes it well-suited for powering a wide range of devices from laptops and cameras to small appliances and even certain power tools. You will love DJI's next-generation fast recharging technology which restores the battery to full capacity in just 70 minutes when plugged into a grid power source, or 80 minutes when using an optional solar panel. This rapid recharge time means you spend less time waiting and more time enjoying your outdoor activities.

The device also includes dual 140W USB-C fast charging ports capable of efficiently powering high-demand electronics such as the 16-inch MacBook Pro, gaming laptops, tablets, and cameras. You can also enjoy two USB-A ports to charge your devices.

Another significant advantage of the DJI Power 1000 is its whisper-quiet operation: Rated at only 23 decibels, it ensures minimal noise disruption which is an important consideration for peaceful camping environments or quiet home backup situations. This ultra-silent performance has been rigorously tested and certified by five SGS noise tests, guaranteeing a comfortable user experience. Safety and longevity are also key priorities for DJI.

The power station's LiFePO4 battery supports up to 4000 charge cycles, translating to an impressive lifespan of around 10 years. It comes equipped with an advanced Battery Management System (BMS) that protects against over-current, over-voltage, and over-discharge, backed by 26 SGS certifications to ensure top-tier safety and reliability.

Given the limited stock and strong demand, this offer won't last long. Make sure you grab yours.

Donald Trump and Elon Musk still are not speaking, but the breakup does not appear like it will bring an end to the free advertising that Musk got for himself in the White House. In a press conference on Monday, Trump told reporters that he is going to keep the Starlink internet connection that was installed at the presidential residence earlier this year, calling it “a good service.”

Trump also threw some cold water on the idea that he was going to sell his Tesla that he bought earlier this year as a favor to Musk while Tesla was the subject of protests and the company's stock was tanking. “I may move the Tesla around a little bit,” he said, but he didn't say he intended to sell it. When asked what “moving it around” means, Trump just said, “I have a lot of locations.” Okay! The Tesla is currently at the White House, where it's available for staffers to use.

While Trump intends to keep Starlink connected at the White House, security experts sure wish he wouldn't. The service, which was reportedly installed by DOGE earlier this year, per the Washington Post, went up without the approval of the people who manage White House communications systems. They were unable to monitor activity on the network, which was only protected by a prompt asking users to provide a password. By comparison, the White House's primary WiFi network requires people to create a username and password in order to connect, and those accounts expire after one week. So, that's not ideal.

Trump could use the security concerns as a way to ditch Musk, but he's really doing his best to remain cordial about the whole situation—a shock for a guy who is not exactly known to be above petty potshots and insults. He went so far as to say on Monday, “I wish him well. We had a good relationship and I just wish him well, very well actually.” So while the two still aren't talking, Trump isn't fanning the flames.

And while Trump may not be ditching his Musk-related equipment, the rest of the government may not be so loyal. The Washington Post reported this weekend that officials at both NASA and the Pentagon started pushing SpaceX competitors to step up and offer alternatives to the services provided by the Musk-backed venture. The reason isn't petty or vindictive, but rather safety-related: Musk threatened to decommission its Dragon spacecraft, which is essential for transporting astronauts to the International Space Station. The agencies simply can't rely on a guy who could just one day declare he's not going to complete an essential service they are counting on and contracted out to him.

The Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) has just released the “largest look ever into the deep universe.” Even more importantly, it has made the data publicly available and accessible “in an easily searchable format.” Possibly the star attraction from this massive 1.5TB of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) data is the interactive viewer, where you can gawp at stunning space imagery encompassing nearly 800,000 galaxies. At the same site, you can find the complete set of NIRCam and MIRI mosaics and tiles, plus a full photometric catalog.

The COSMOS-Web program is a NASA-backed project with the support of scientists from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), and Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). With this significant data release, the public at large is getting access to the largest view deep into the universe they will have ever seen.

According to the press release announcement, the published survey maps 0.54 degrees of the sky, or “about the area of three full moons,” with the NIRCam (near infrared imaging), and a 0.2 square degree area with MIRI (mid-infrared imaging).

To help Joe Public make sense of this 1.5TB data deluge, COSMOS-Web has thoughtfully provided a full aperture and model-based photometric catalog. Using this reference, those interested can observe “photometry, structural measurements, redshifts, and physical parameters for nearly 800,000 galaxies.” More excitingly for amateur astrophysics enthusiasts, the researchers claim that the new JWST imaging, combined with previous COSMOS data, “opens many unexplored scientific avenues.”

Before you head on over to the linked resources, it might be useful to familiarize yourself with some of the terms and units used by COSMOS-Web. If we want to look more closely at the JWST NIRCam mosaics, for example, you will see that the newly surveyed area is mapped into 20 zones with reference codes. Each of the mosaics is available in four NIRCam filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W). In terms of scale, mosaics are available in both 30mas and 60mas. ‘Mas' is short for milliarcseconds, a unit of angular measurement commonly used in astronomy.



Both mosaics (created by stitching together multiple tiles), and tiles (individual images, as captured by the telescope) are available for download and study. For example, a single 30mas pixel scale mosaic from NIRCam might require a download of up to 174GB, while the individual tiles are a ‘mere' 7-10GB (compressed). You would also need specialized astronomical software to open these FITS data maps, but there are many options available, including some free and open-source software.

The COSMOS project has made use of most of the major telescopes on Earth and in space. It began with its use of the Hubble Space Telescope to cover what has now become known as the COSMOS field, a 2-square-degree field which appears to cover approximately 2 million galaxies. The initial Hubble survey took 640 orbits of the Earth. Ultimately, it is hoped that the research team will be able to study the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time.

The RX 9060 XT is now available to buy. Here's where you can pick one up if you want one in your gaming rig.

AMD's RX 9060 XT launches today, starting at $299 for the 8GB model and $349 for the 16GB version. AMD has positioned the RX 9060 XT to fend off the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti (especially the 8GB variant) at both MSRP levels. The new GPU will vie for a spot in our list of best graphics cards once our RX 9060 XT review is out.

The RX 9060 XT is AMD's latest RX 9000-series GPU, boasting the same RDNA 4 architecture as the RX 9070 series. The GPU is quite literally an RX 9070 XT cut in half, sporting 32 CUs, 2,048 shader cores, and a 128-bit memory interface. AMD is hitting the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti's weak points by offering its 16GB variant at a lower price than the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB and re-introducing a full x16 PCIe configuration to the RX 9060 XT, giving it a performance edge (particularly the 8GB model) against its Blackwell competitors in older systems where PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 support may not be available.

However, just like the RTX 5060 and the 8GB version of the RTX 5060 Ti, AMD has received heavy criticism for offering an 8GB version of the RX 9060 XT. Before launch, Frank Azor famously stated on X that ""The Majority of gamers are still playing at 1080p and have no use for more than 8GB of memory,"" even though some AAA games are already consuming more than 8GB of video memory at 1080p with ultra graphics settings. Worse, AMD neglected to give any reviewers the 8GB model of the RX 9060 XT for testing, forcing them only to test the 16GB model.

Third-party reviewer testing shows the RX 9060 XT 16GB performing 10-20% better than the RTX 5060 on average, depending on the resolution. Naturally, you'll need to do in-depth research on the types of games and resolution that you prefer before pulling the trigger.

If you do opt for the 9060 XT, we've put a list of all partner cards below that you'll be able to buy from US-based retailers:

But it's no match for Apple's M4 Max, yet...

Nvidia's rumored N1X SoC has surfaced on Geekbench, rivaling the best mobile offerings from Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm, via Olrak at X. The alleged 20-core chip has hit over 3,000 single-core points on Geekbench, with multi-core performance nearing AMD's leading Strix Halo line. That being said, it's prudent that we approach this leak with caution, given that Nvidia has yet to confirm this chip officially.

The N1 family has long been a subject of rumors, marking Nvidia's foray into the consumer Windows-on-Arm landscape. Nvidia has reportedly partnered with MediaTek, which is expected to handle the CPU development of this SoC using off-the-shelf Arm Cortex cores. The first practical application of this partnership is the DGX Spark (formerly Project DIGITS), based on the GB10 superchip with 20 Arm cores (10x Cortex-X925 + 10x Cortex-A725) alongside a GPU that sports 6,144 CUDA cores based on the Blackwell architecture.

Per the Geekbench listing, the N1X was sported atop an HP development board (HP 83A3) under Linux (Ubuntu 24.04.1). With a 20-thread configuration in the listing, and the fact that Arm designs generally lack SMT (Simultaneous Multithreading) like Intel's Lion Cove, we're probably looking at 20 physical cores, similar to the GB10 mentioned above. At the same time, the development board is likely equipped with 128GB of system memory, with 8GB reserved for the GPU.

Before jumping into performance, it's generally not advisable to compare CPUs across different Operating Systems and Geekbench releases. So, I've listed a few relevant CPU samples, noting their OS and Geekbench version. The alleged N1X scores 3,096 points and 18,837 points in single-core and multi-core territories, respectively, with the frequency averaging out at 4 GHz. Even with varying environments, its performance is well within the range of top chips like Intel's Arrow Lake-HX and AMD's Ryzen AI MAX (Strix Halo).

It even trumps Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite; that's expected since the X Elite uses Oryon V1 cores, which should be superseded by Oryon V3 with Snapdragon X2 SoCs next year. That being said, Apple still reigns supreme in Geekbench, with the M4 Max comfortably ahead by 30% (single-core).

Nvidia shied away from announcing or even mentioning these chips at Computex last month, so we may be in for a 2026 debut. It's possible the company may be dedicating more resources to DGX Spark, hoping to make these mini-PCs available for purchase before the upcoming holiday season. Regardless, by next year, more competition is expected with AMD's rumored Sound Wave APUs and Qualcomm's X2 SoCs, in addition to Panther Lake from Intel.

This is as DIY as it gets.

Reports from r/TEAMEVGA and other forums indicate a growing concern regarding boot-up problems with newer RTX 50 GPUs on motherboards from EVGA. The problem lies with extra SMBUS pins on several EVGA motherboards, which create a conflict when paired with GPUs from Nvidia. Without official support, users have resorted to an ingenious fix: physically taping over the pins on the GPU's PCIe connector to silence any unwanted communication, and thus far, this solution has proven successful for several individuals.

Citing conflicts with Nvidia, EVGA withdrew from the GPU market in 2022 and scaled back its other business operations considerably. A direct consequence of this contraction has manifested in the form of lackluster software support, which is likely the cause of these reported boot-up problems. It's likely not a matter of malicious intent, but rather a consequence of EVGA's drastic scale-down, which means they likely don't have enough resources to dedicate to software, assuming those teams still even exist.

According to the Redditor, their EVGA Z690 Classified includes SMBUS pins in the PCIe slot (pins 5 and 6), which are generally left unwired in most consumer-grade alternatives. SMBUS is a small communication line that's largely used by components for lightweight communication, think power management and temperature. It's highly possible that Nvidia's RTX 50 GPUs likely don't expect or cannot handle an SMBUS connection, which effectively halts the system from booting up.

Naturally, users aren't happy. ""EVGA is a shadow of its former self and getting BIOS updates for hardware compatibility issues is like pulling teeth,"" one lamented, ""They've basically left their customers out to dry in regards to their motherboards."" Others accused EVGA of using Nvidia as a scapegoat and of neglecting its customers

""EVGA is a shadow of its former self and getting BIOS updates for hardware compatibility issues is like pulling teeth. They've basically left their customers out to dry in regards to their motherboards.""


Even if disabling these pins through firmware were an option, EVGA's support has shrunk to Reddit forums, likely mirroring the state of their software teams. The Redditor found a crafty workaround by scouring old forums and identifying the problem's source as pins 5 and pins 6 on the GPU's gold finger, responsible for managing the SMBUS connection.

The solution was to break the connection with the help of a 2mm-wide strip of Kapton tape over the two pins on the PCIe connector, effectively creating a barrier and stopping the SMBUS signals from reaching the GPU. It is a bit finicky, requiring great precision to ensure only those specific pins are blocked, but it works nonetheless.

As a prerequisite, the user suggests cleaning the gold finger with isopropyl alcohol. It is important to note this isn't a widespread issue, since other EVGA motherboards, including some Z690 models and most Z790 models, reportedly remain unaffected. We haven't heard anything official from EVGA on the matter, at least not yet.

This works due to Nintendo's use of the SD Express 7.1 standard.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A gaming peripheral developer and console modder has shared details of their SDEX2M2 Adapter project. Despite the cryptic name, the project goal is a rather simple one – to create a reliable adapter for using the Nintendo Switch 2's MicroSD Express card port to attach an M.2 NVMe SSD. The SDEX2M2 project is open source, and though it is still a work-in-progress, interested parties can visit the NVNTLabs GitHub page and check out extensive details of the components and schematics used.

Nintendo typically likes to lock down its consoles rather strictly, so seeing this kind of project at an advanced stage, so early after the launch of its Switch 2, might cheer console hackers and modders.

This storage mod “is possible because the Nintendo Switch 2's MicroSD Express slot supports the SD Express 7.1 standard, which exposes a true PCIe Gen3 x1 interface and utilizes the NVMe protocol for communication,” explains developer NVNTLabs on the SDEX2M2 GitHub project page. And, because the hardware adapter simply maps the appropriate pins from the Switch MicroSD Express slot to a standard M.2 2230 NVMe SSD, “no protocol translation is required as the Switch 2 host controller handles everything.”



For performance, users should expect data transfers up to approximately the limits of the PCIe Gen3 x1 interface, which is roughly 1 GB/s. That's on a par with freshly launched cards from the likes of PNY. However, instead of spending $56 on a PNY microSD Express UHS-I U3 V30 A1 microSDXC Flash Memory Card with a measly 256GB capacity, you can get double the capacity with a Sabrent for the same price. We also see 1TB M.2 2230 NVMe SSDs, like the Patriot Viper Gaming VP4000 Mini 1TB M.2 2230 PCIe Gen4 x4 SSD for just $66. You will need to make/buy this new SDEX2M2 device first, though.

As a work-in-progress, there are still a few aspects of the SDEX2M2 design to iron out. Probably the biggest factor to be wary of is damaging your Switch 2 due to the use of an M.2 SSD that is too power hungry. NVNTLabs warns that any fellow modders who want to pick up and roll ahead with the design as it stands should “only use low-voltage, low-power M.2 2230 NVMe drives.” Also, despite physical similarities, users are asked not to insert this adapter into legacy MicroSD card slot-equipped devices like the original Nintendo Switch.

For now, this project shines the light on a possible way to attach cheaper storage for your Switch 2. However, PCIe isn't just for storage, in modern PCs this high-speed interface is used for lots of other things like network and expansion cards, sound and capture cards, AI accelerators, and – of course – graphics cards.

The Nintendo Switch 2's official specs confirmed the presence of an Nvidia Ampere architecture GPU similar to a mobile GeForce RTX 2050. Would it be possible to use the exposed PCIe Gen3 x1 interface to plug in some kind of eGPU?

There are indeed plenty of M.2 SSD slot to OCuLink adapters, but the available PCIe Gen3 x1 with 1 GB/s (8 Gbps) seems rather restrictive. Typically, we see eGPUs attach to devices using USB4 at up to 40 Gbps, or OCuLink at up to 64 Gbps, which can impact GPU performance, and also provide some context to how weedy PCIe Gen3 x1 is.

Moreover, there would probably have to be some more modding required for the Switch 2 to use the eGPU rather than the onboard GPU for video out. We can't say it is impossible, but it would be an impressive feat to get such a setup working.

Launch prices for Medicare Part D anticancer drugs have risen sharply since 2012, with a mean increase of $1694 per year. In 2025, the observed prices were 15%-200% higher than expected if the increases were due to inflation alone, but the gap between observed and inflation-adjusted prices narrowed over the study period.

“Launch prices for self-administered targeted anticancer therapies have grown precipitously, although no evidence was found of disproportionate increases in recent years. Instead, continued launch price growth for anticancer therapies was observed, consistent with prior research,” the study authors wrote. “This suggests that companies were already engaging in price maximization for anticancer therapies and continued to do so after the implementation of the [Inflation Reduction Act].”

This study, led by Stacie B. Dusetzina, PhD, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee, was published online in JAMA.

This study used example indications to determine monthly doses and pricing. Additionally, variations in available price measures were noted over the study period.

This study was funded by Arnold Ventures. Several authors reported receiving grants or personal fees and having other ties with various sources.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

 June 10, 2025  

Regardless of how close your retirement horizon is, thinking about what you'd like to do (and not do) when you stop practicing medicine can help ensure a fulfilling retirement. We asked several (happily) retired physicians for their eight best pieces of advice about planning for your next chapter.

Medscape continually surveys physicians and other medical professionals about key practice challenges and current issues, creating high-impact analyses. For example,

The Medscape Physicians Eye Retirement 2023 Report found that

You're a doctor. Great. But what — or who — else are you? An identity outside of medicine is critical for a happy retirement.

“I noticed that as my peers were retiring, if their self-identity was almost exclusively as a health care provider — ‘I'm a physician and nothing else,' those people had a hard time,” Chuck Daris, MD, a former internist, rheumatologist, and chief medical officer in suburban Chicago who retired just before 2019, told Medscape Medical News. 

“You go from being sort of the center of the universe as a physician…and getting all this external validation of what you do every day, and all of a sudden, you're not that. You're just another person walking into the grocery store.” A sense of who you are — and what matters to you — outside of practicing medicine will help you segue into a happier retirement.

A critical part of retirement is figuring out your finances well before you hang up your stethoscope. “Read up on Medicare, Social Security, and health insurance,” said Steve Green, MD, a family medicine practitioner in San Diego who retired in 2022. “You may be able to retire before you think…it's important to have an actual plan.” Doctors can get trapped in the “money accumulation” phase, he said. 

“It's a hard change to say, ‘I have enough money, and now all I have is time,'” he adds. “I say you have the ‘go-go' years, the ‘slow-go' years, and the ‘no-go' years. You want to retire during the go-go years.”

“I had people warning me, ‘You're so used to being busy, you're going to struggle with retirement,'” said Green. However, his transition was relatively easy because of his many interests and friends outside of medicine.

“I swim in the pool and in the ocean; I hike; I row competitively; I like to bicycle; and I've been golfing badly for years and am now taking lessons,” he added. Green said he's never had any sense of regret about retirement because he is too busy with his numerous nonmedical interests, hobbies, and pursuits.

Who are your friends outside of work? You may find yourself looking for new ones once you retire. “You need to cultivate a network of other people. You tend to lose the hospital people or clinical people as you retire,” warned Daris, whose hobby is landscape photography. The retired physician belongs to a camera club and has traveled with friends he met there to shoot photos in far-flung locales, including Chile, Patagonia, and Pakistan.

Green has a network of friends through golf, swimming, and rowing. “Socializing and remaining connected is an important part of retirement,” said Daris. “Too many physicians don't have any network outside their medical network.” Befriending other doctors who have already retired as well as other retired friends is another good stepping stone to forming a retired friends circle.

Green hadn't planned to work post-retirement but took a part-time position as a member of the board of directors for a healthcare system in northern California. Daris is a part-time surveyor for the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care in the Chicago suburbs. “About once a month, I go out to ambulatory clinics and surgical centers — I get out of the house, and I get to use my medical skills on my own terms,” said Daris. “It keeps me connected — and I have an entirely new network of people I didn't have before.” Retirement doesn't have to be cookie-cutter or look like anyone else's. Take a part-time job, start a side gig, or consult. Only you can do you.

Virginia Hall, MD, a former professor of obstetrician and gynecologist in Pennsylvania who retired in 2018, volunteers twice a month at a free clinic that treats patients who lack insurance; she also chairs a foundation that gave her a full tuition scholarship from her first year of medical school.

“I feel it's very important to give back and show gratitude,” said Hall. “Don't think that you're going to sit there in a rocking chair…I think about, how can I make people's lives better? I was given the gift of being able to take care of people and I'm not done yet.”

Yet you also want to avoid overbooking yourself. “Don't overcommit to a schedule,” said Green. “I have some friends who are also retired who when I ask about golf, they literally have meetings all week for various things,” he added. “They still aren't letting themselves enjoy their free time.

“I lived so much of my life on a regimented schedule where my days were packed. Building in free time and some flexibility is one of the joys of retiring so don't forget to schedule some. It's really nice to wake up and think, ‘I'll go on a bike ride now. That flexibility is enjoyable.”

Finally, plan ahead so you can consider retiring earlier rather than later, said Green. “In medicine, the culture is often to work until you can't stand up anymore. I think retirement shouldn't be just the absence of work — it should be something you look forward to and plan for.

 June 10, 2025  

Health organizations and professional societies are expressing outrage over the firing of all 17 members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announced on June 9 in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece that he was “totally reconstituting” the ACIP, saying that all the current members had conflicts of interest and that they were beholden to vaccine makers. 

“A clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science,” wrote Kennedy.

There is no indication when new members will be named but the panel is due to meet June 25-27.

Susan Kressly, MD, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement that the organization was “deeply troubled and alarmed” by the firings. “We are witnessing an escalating effort by the Administration to silence independent medical expertise and stoke distrust in lifesaving vaccines,” said Kressly, adding that the action, combined with Kennedy's unilateral decision to recommend against COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women and to require shared decision making for healthy children to get the vaccine, creates “confusion around proven vaccines.” 

Kennedy's action “is a coup,” said American Public Health Association (APHA) Executive Director Georges C. Benjamin, MD, in a statement. “Today's ACIP members are some of the most qualified individuals to evaluate vaccines,” said Benjamin, adding that they “were vetted for conflicts of interest prior to appointment.” The APHA leader said a new slate of members chosen by Kennedy “will be suspect and likely mistrusted.”

American College of Physicians (ACP) President Jason M. Goldman, MD, said in a statement that the firings “coupled with the recent, preemptive actions HHS took on the COVID-19 vaccines that circumvented the standard, transparent vaccine review process, interferes with the practice of evidence-based medicine and destabilizes a trusted source and its evidence-based process.” Goldman, who is also the ACP liaison to ACIP, said he believed Kennedy's actions will “seriously erode public confidence in our government's ability to ensure the health of the American public.”

The American Medical Association also weighed in. President Bruce A. Scott, MD, said in a statement that ACIP had for generations “been a trusted national source of science- and data-driven advice and guidance on the use of vaccines to prevent and control disease.” The firings “undermines that trust and upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives,” he wrote, adding that “with an ongoing measles outbreak and routine child vaccination rates declining, this move will further fuel the spread of vaccine-preventable illnesses.”

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana), who was a pivotal vote in confirming Kennedy, posted on X that “now the fear is that the ACIP will be filled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion.” Kennedy added that he'd talked with Kennedy, “and I'll continue to talk with him to ensure this is not the case.”

Rep. Kim Schrier, MD (D-Washington), a pediatrician, wrote on Bluesky that the firings paved the way for Kennedy “to make up his own recommendations or fill those positions with conspiracy theorists and social media influencers.” Schrier said that she had introduced a bill on June 5 to make ACIP a “legally required organization” that would be made up of only those with relevant scientific expertise.

Kennedy has repeatedly said that the ACIP is rife with conflicts and used that as justification for the firings. The ACIP “has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine,” he wrote in the Wall Street Journal, adding that, “Most of ACIP's members have received substantial funding from pharmaceutical companies.”

He did not provide any evidence for that statement. The members' bios and disclosures show no direct industry funding, which is also not allowed for ACIP panelists.

The allegations about the panel's integrity “are completely unfounded,” said Infectious Diseases Society of America President Tina Tan, MD, in a statement. “ACIP is a highly qualified group of experts that has always operated with transparency and a commitment to protecting the public's health,” she added.

The ACIP's policies and procedures require members to file financial disclosures when they are appointed and then annually during their 4-year terms. Conflicts are vetted by HHS officials. Members also disclose potential conflicts at the outset of every meeting. Panelists with a relevant conflict must recuse themselves — often it is because they were an investigator on a vaccine trial or served on a data monitoring board. Those roles are considered acceptable under ACIP rules, however. 

Panelists can't be employed directly by industry, nor hold stock, or be entitled to or receive royalties or other compensation on a vaccine or vaccine process. They have to resign advisory or consulting roles during their ACIP tenure. They also cannot serve as an expert witness involving litigation with a vaccine maker or accept honoraria or travel reimbursement from a vaccine maker.

When Kennedy came into office, he had the CDC establish a “conflicts of interest disclosure” website, which essentially compiled ACIP panelists' roles as investigators or data monitoring board members. 

Kennedy “has worked for more than a decade to sow distrust in vaccines,” Jennifer Nuzzo, DrPh, professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health, wrote on BlueSky.

In a later post, she wrote, that her “biggest worry is this is the start of a process to erode Americans' access to vaccines.”

 June 10, 2025  

New guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes include tools clinicians can use to help patients stick to lifestyle interventions.

The guidelines, released on June 10 by the American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM), largely mirror lifestyle guidelines by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) but add specifics about how clinicians can help patients achieve their goals.

A panel of practitioners working in lifestyle medicine, including primary care physicians, cardiologists, endocrinologists, sleep experts, dietitians, and exercise medicine specialists, laid out six areas clinicians should help patients manage. These include sleep and stress, nutrition, physical activity, tobacco and alcohol, and social connection.

The new guidelines are intended to “enhance some of the health behaviors that are recommended by all of the leading authorities and medical societies,” said Mahima Gulati, MD, an endocrinologist and visiting associate professor of medicine at the University of Connecticut in Farmington, Connecticut.

Each patient should still receive tailored counseling, which may include medication, Gulati said.

“Lifestyle interventions are the foundation of diabetes and prediabetes no matter what,” said Nestoras Mathioudakis, MD, co-medical director of the Diabetes Prevention & Education Program at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, who was not involved with the new guidelines. “Whether we jump to medications depends on how far off from the goal they are, but doctors should never diagnose someone with diabetes or prediabetes and say, ‘Keep doing what you're doing, and just here's some medication.'”

Mathioudakis said the recommendation of using SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) goals allows patients to work with their care providers to set achievable milestones that can be reevaluated during visits.

“We have to be careful not to overwhelm people,” Mathioudakis said. “I have found with my patients that when I do this counseling, setting small achievable goals at each visit and building as we go is more effective than bombarding them with everything.”

Gulati and her team broke their recommendations into two groups. “Strong” recommendations were backed by high-quality scientific evidence, while other recommendations lacked the same level of robust supportive data.

The strong recommendations include:

They also make the following other recommendations:

Particularly with exercise and nutrition goals, clinicians need to be mindful of a patient's baseline instead of implementing drastic diet or movement changes at the start.

“If you have someone who is drinking 10 cans of soda per day, we aren't going to get into the nitty-gritty details of a Mediterranean diet right away; we need to start with reducing or eliminating these sugary beverages,” he said.

On the other hand, a patient who is well-versed in nutrition may need more sophisticated education about what parts of their diet may unknowingly be contributing to mismanaged blood sugars, he said.

The guidelines also recommend prescribing aerobic and muscle strength exercises using the SMART goal framework. Rather than simply telling patients to get more exercise, Gulati and her team recommend giving people examples of specific exercises that count as aerobic or strength training that are suited to each patient.

“One thing I thought was really good about these guidelines is they give links to YouTube videos on exercises for older people or those with limitations,” Mathioudakis said.

While exercise and nutrition are mainstays of lifestyle interventions for diabetes management, sleep and social connection are newer recommendations that began appearing in official ADA guidelines within the past 5 years.

“I think things are changing a bit now, but not every healthcare provider may understand the vital role sleep plays in patients with diabetes,” Gulati said. “Especially shift work, if someone is working shift work, their risk of diabetes goes up significantly. Same with obstructive sleep apnea.”

Social connection is another domain that can help or harm a patient's ability to stick to lifestyle interventions.

“How can a patient change their own way of eating if their spouse doesn't want to eat that way?” Gulati said. “If the patient isn't able to drive, do they have a support network to ensure they always have a ride to doctor's appointments?”

Even with strong social support, people may backtrack on progress, Gulati said. In these cases, she said, never guilt or shame patients, and always include them in decision-making about what their next goals should be.

“They may do good on nutrition for a while, but then they fall off, or they had some disruptions in their sleep routine, and now they want to focus on that,” she said. “Priorities may change as time goes on.”

This study was supported by the ACLM. The panel members received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of the guidelines. Various guideline authors reported financial disclosures including receiving consulting fees from Sanofi and LifeScan Diabetes and serving as an advisor to Medtronic, among others.

 June 10, 2025  

A district judge has ruled that physicians can move forward with a federal lawsuit that accuses insurers and an analytics company of underpaying them by billions through a price-fixing scheme for out-of-network services.

In a June 3 decision, US District Judge Matthew Kennelly wrote that providers have alleged a direct injury from the reported price-fixing agreement and that their antitrust claims against data company MultiPlan are valid.

The ruling addresses two consolidated complaints by several plaintiffs, including the American Medical Association (AMA) and the Illinois State Medical Society (ISMS), against MultiPlan, which has now changed its name to Claritev.

The medical associations claim MultiPlan/Claritev and third-party payers violated federal and state antitrust laws with a price-fixing conspiracy that forced physicians to accept increasingly low payments for out-of-network services. The suit names Aetna, Cigna, UnitedHealth Group, and Health Care Service Corporation, a Mutual Legal Reserve Company, as “co-conspirators” in the complaint, among other “smaller” insurers.

AMA President Bruce A. Scott, MD, praised the court for allowing the case to proceed, calling the ruling “the clearest statement yet by a court that MultiPlan's lack of transparency, accuracy, and integrity in the insurer-run system for paying out-of-network medical bills is an antitrust violation.”

“MultiPlan and the commercial health insurance companies have profited from the rigged system while forcing physicians to accept lower and lower payment amounts for out-of-network services — payments that in many cases do not cover the cost of delivering care to patients,” Scott said in a media statement. “Ending this conspiracy is a good start toward creating an open and honest system that will restore fair reimbursements and help ensure patients have access to the care they need.”

A Claritev spokeswoman told Medscape Medical News in an email that the company remains “confident that the facts will reinforce what we've consistently said — that these lawsuits are without merit and fail to acknowledge the critical role our competitive options play in reducing healthcare costs for employers and improving access for patients.”

“These lawsuits will only serve to increase healthcare [costs] for employers and patients. We will vigorously defend ourselves through the legal process while remaining focused on delivering value to our customers and the broader healthcare ecosystem.”

ISMS President Richard C. Anderson, MD, said the medical society appreciates the ruling and that it's “time for MultiPlan to face the music.”

“The company can change its name, but it doesn't change the fact that they reaped huge profits from this price-fixing collusion,” Anderson wrote in an email to Medscape Medical News. “They routinely paid below-market reimbursement rates to physician for out-of-network healthcare services with no transparency in their process. Patients and physicians deserve better.”

On its website, Claritev describes itself as a healthcare technology, data, and insights company that focuses on improving affordability, transparency, and quality. 

The company offers an alternative method for calculating a third-party payer's out-of-network rate through its Data iSight algorithm, according to court records. Data iSight calculates rates by referencing the cost of the service to the provider and the median payment for similar services rendered, according to the legal summary. Using these metrics, the algorithm tends to produce lower payment rates than Usual, Customary, and Reasonable benchmarks.

If payers agree to use a Data iSight-calculated rate, the company offers to negotiate the rate with providers on behalf of the insurer. During the negotiation, MultiPlan/Claritev conditions all payments on a provider's agreement not to balance bill the patient, according to the legal summary.

The plaintiffs allege the company's rates are provided on a “take-it-or-leave-it” basis and that they were unable to convince the company to deviate from a Data iSight-calculated rate.

Providers can still decline MultiPlan's offer and seek payment directly from the patient and the insurer, according to court documents.

An April 2020 study by the Office of the New York State Comptroller found that payments based on MultiPlan's repricing methodology at the time were 1.5-49 times lower than payments for the same services based on the traditional method of calculating out-of-network payment rates for physicians, according to the AMA.

The physician plaintiffs contend the company undercuts fair payment for out-of-network healthcare services and eliminates market competition. The “widespread conspiracy” between the company and insurers has forced many medical practices to shut down, cease offering certain services, or seek other employment arrangements, according to their complaint.

Insurers have contracted with MultiPlan to use its Data iSight algorithm and negotiation services since 2015, and by 2018, hundreds of third-party payers had contracts with the company, according to court records. The company grew to having contracts with more than 700 third-party payers and, in 2019, processed more than 80% of out-of-network healthcare service payments, according to court documents.

A 2024 New York Times investigation found that both the company and insurers made more money when then-MultiPlan lowered fees paid to physicians for out-of-network services. In May 2024, Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), US senators, requested more information from MultiPlan, expressing concern that the company might be driving up costs for consumers.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) also sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission in May 2024, seeking an investigation into what she deemed “potentially anticompetitive conduct.”

MultiPlan/Claritev asked the court to throw out the complaint, arguing the plaintiffs have not asserted a viable federal antitrust claim because they have not proven antitrust standing nor shown how the company violated antitrust law.

Even if the providers are getting below-market payments, the company said the doctors have failed to allege the lesser payments are due to a harm to competition. Rather, MultiPlan/Claritev's services increase competition by providing another rate calculation option, and its services are further beneficial because they lower costs to third-party payers and patients, the company's attorneys argued.

In addition, the company contended that providers have not been directly injured by the alleged party payer agreement to fix prices because “they can always seek full payment from the patient.”

However, Kennelly wrote that the providers have alleged a direct injury because the alleged balance billing prohibition prevents providers from seeking the remaining payment from patients and “shields patients from the consequences of the alleged third-party payor price-fixing agreement.”

If MultiPlan/Claritev's services are harmful or beneficial to competition is a matter for further court analysis, Kennelly also said.

“Whether MultiPlan facilitates a third-party payor price-fixing agreement or is simply another pricing option for payors is a factual dispute that cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss,” he wrote in his ruling.

The judge, however, dismissed the plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims against the company. Kennelly wrote the physicians failed to allege an unjust enrichment claim under a specific state law.

A case management conference in the case is scheduled for June 17.

Over the past two decades, the prevalence of autoimmune diseases among pregnant women in the UK has significantly increased, with psoriasis being the most common condition. The likelihood of diagnosis varied across sociodemographic factors, including age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.

""This study gives a clear estimate of the burden of autoimmune diseases in pregnancy in the UK and the possible association with various demographic factors, and will help the process of improving maternity care for women with these health conditions,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Megha Singh, PhD, Department of Applied Health Sciences, College of Medicine and Health, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, England. It was published online on June 02, 2025, in The Lancet Rheumatology.

This study did not include some rare autoimmune diseases like dermatomyositis. Although the use of primary care data reduced entry-level coding biases, improvements in recording practices over time might affect data quality and completeness, potentially affecting observed trends. Additionally, this study may have underestimated the prevalence of autoimmune diseases since most cases are diagnosed and managed in secondary care.

This study was supported by the Strategic Priority Fund ""Tackling multimorbidity at scale"" programme. One author initially worked at the University of Birmingham and later joined AstraZeneca and currently holds an honorary contract with the University of Birmingham.

Patients with frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) were significantly more likely to come from low vulnerability zip codes than those with alopecia areata (AA) in a study that also suggested that race was not an independent predictor of FFA.

“Our study suggests that FFA patients are more likely to be from affluent zip codes as determined by their SVI when compared to AA patients,” the authors wrote. “We believe, therefore, that historical emphasis on race in FFA may have been overstated due to the impact of race on socioeconomic status.”

The study was led by Jiana Wyche, MHS, Department of Dermatology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and was published online on May 16 in Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

The study was conducted at a single institution with most patients from Maryland, which may limit generalizability.

The study did not receive any funding. One author reported serving as a consultant for Pfizer, Lilly, Myovant, and Galderma; being on the advisory board for Olaplex and CP Skin Health; receiving royalties as editor of the UpToDate, and receiving research support from Janssen.

When it comes to treating strokes, time-to-intervention is most critical. About 1.9 million brain cells die on average for each minute that a large vessel stroke goes untreated. To improve recognition of the early warning signs of a stroke, NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island is conducting a quality study with healthcare providers in its Simulation Center in Mineola. During the study, healthcare providers interact with and manage a simulated patient who is experiencing a stroke.

""In our continuing effort to reduce the time when stroke patients first enter our hospital to when they are diagnosed and receive lifesaving treatments, we are utilizing our high-tech Simulation Center to create real-life scenarios to test how quickly responders can recognize the signs of a stroke and act,"" said Levi D. Dygert, MD, an NYU Langone vascular neurologist who is leading the initiative. ""Medical residents and physician assistants are participating in this project, and to date, the results are quite promising.""

Patients who are diagnosed with large vessel occlusion strokes typically have two treatment options: receive an injection of clot-dissolving therapeutics, which can be used within the first 4.5 hours, or undergo a neurointerventional procedure to remove the clot by sucking it out through a puncture in the artery.

All members of the stroke team at NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island participated in the training. The most significant finding of the study was a reduction in time from door-to-activation of the neurointerventional radiology team by 12.5 minutes (35.2 percent). The study also found that door-to-arterial puncture time was reduced by 10 minutes (11.9 percent) and door-to-clot removal engagement was reduced by 6.5 minutes (6.2 percent).

""Simulation Center training is always helpful because every case can be different. You are able to get feedback from the medical team that is observing how you reacted to a particular scenario, as well as from actors who may play the roles of patients or their families,"" said Syeda Fatima, MD, a second-year neurology resident who participated in a training session involving a simulated stroke patient with a complex medical history and an actor playing the role of a family member.

Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States, and the leading cause of adult disability. On average, every 40 seconds, someone in the U.S. has a stroke. Findings from this study are set to presented to the American Heart Association next year.

The 5,000-square-foot Simulation Center provides valuable clinical training and education for physicians, nurses, residents, and medical students at NYU Grossman Long Island School of Medicine, as well as other health professionals and first responders. The facility provides a safe and engaging educational environment that promotes the knowledge, competence, and performance of the individual learner and the interprofessional care team.

IVD is a key enzyme in leucine catabolism, catalyzing the conversion of isovaleryl-CoA to 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA. Defects in IVD function lead to toxic accumulation of metabolites such as isovaleric acid, resulting in isovaleric acidemia (IVA)-a life-threatening autosomal recessive disorder characterized by vomiting, metabolic acidosis, and neurological damage. Although IVD gene mutations are known to cause IVA, the enzyme's structural dynamics and complex substrate-binding mechanisms have long hindered precise mechanistic studies.

By optimizing protein purification protocols, the team obtained cryo-EM structures of IVD in apo state and in complex with substrates (isovaleryl-CoA and butyryl-CoA) at high resolutions. The structures revealed that human IVD exists as a tetramer, with each monomer forming a unique ""U-shaped"" substrate channel composed of α-helical and β-sheet domains. This architecture enables selective recognition of short-branched chain substrates while excluding longer chains due to steric hindrance.

Further analysis highlighted IVD's distinct substrate selectivity within the ACAD family of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Unlike ACADM (which processes straight-chain C6-C12 substrates), IVD exhibits two defining features: preference for shorter branched-chain substrates (C4-C6). Structural comparisons between IVD and ACADM revealed critical differences in their active pockets. In IVD, residues L127 and L290 form a narrowed side-chain distance (compared to T121 and V284 in ACADM), creating spatial constraints that exclude substrates longer than C7 via a ""bottleneck effect"". Conversely, ACADM's Y400 and E401 residues restrict lateral flexibility with bulky side chains, while IVD's G406 and A407 reduce steric hindrance, enabling accommodation of branched chains.

The study identified glutamate residue E286 as the catalytic core, facilitating α-hydrogen abstraction, while the FAD cofactor stabilizes the tetramer through hydrogen bonds with T200, R312, and E411. Disease-associated mutations (e.g., A314V, E411K) disrupt FAD binding or distort the substrate pocket, reducing enzymatic activity by over 80%. For example, the E411K mutation replaces negatively charged glutamate with lysine, destabilizing FAD binding and tetramer integrity. These atomic-level insights clarify genotype-phenotype correlations, improving diagnostic accuracy and prognostic predictions.

The resolved structures provide a foundation for developing small-molecule therapeutics targeting the FAD-binding region or substrate pocket to stabilize mutant IVD and restore partial function. Additionally, the established ""mutation-structure-function"" framework enhances precision in IVA diagnosis and personalized treatment planning. This study not only advances our understanding of IVD's structural biology but also opens avenues for tackling this rare metabolic disorder.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study reveals double disadvantage for ethnic minority healthcare workers born overseas","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250610/Study-reveals-double-disadvantage-for-ethnic-minority-healthcare-workers-born-overseas.aspx","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 13:19:00 GMT","

Ethnic minority healthcare workers who are also born overseas face a double disadvantage due to the combined effects of ethnicity and migrant status, according to new research published in JRSM Open.

Using data from the nationwide UK-REACH cohort study, this is the first analysis to explore how migration status - often overlooked in Human Resources records - intersects with ethnicity to affect NHS career progression.

The cross-sectional study of over 5,700 healthcare workers employed under the NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) pay scale - which covers staff including nurses, midwives, and allied health professionals - found that overseas-born staff were significantly less likely to be placed in higher AfC pay bands, even after adjusting for education, job role, and years of professional qualification. In particular, Asian and Black healthcare workers born overseas were less likely to reach higher pay bands compared to their White UK-born and trained counterparts.

Our findings highlight that migration status plays a critical role in shaping healthcare professionals' career prospects, yet this data is not routinely collected. These disparities cannot be addressed without first being recognised and recorded.""

Dr. Ji Soo Choi, Lead Author

Although ethnic minority and migrant healthcare workers make up nearly a quarter of the NHS workforce, they remain underrepresented in senior positions within the AfC framework. Migrant workers may face additional challenges distinct from non-migrant ethnic colleagues, including difficulties with international qualification recognition, limited professional networks, and restricted access to training.

The absence of routinely collected migration status data means these issues are often overlooked in research, creating a gap that hinders efforts to address workforce inequality. The authors urge NHS policymakers to include migration status in routine data collection to enable more targeted and effective interventions.

""Ethnic minority healthcare workers represent over a third of staff at NHS pay band 5, but their presence drops sharply to just 10% in senior roles,"" said senior author Professor Manish Pareek. ""This lack of diversity in leadership limits influence over key workplace decisions such as pay, scheduling, and policy, which may contribute to a less supportive environment for ethnic minority staff. These inequalities risk driving higher attrition rates amid the NHS's ongoing staffing challenges.""

The authors recommend that NHS workforce policies explicitly address the distinct barriers faced by migrant healthcare workers, including training access, credential recognition, and mentoring and leadership opportunities.

CN Bio, a leading provider of Organ-on-a-chip (OOC) systems and solutions that accelerate drug discovery and development workflows, has introduced two new animal microphysiological system (MPS) models that enhance translatability in preclinical drug safety and toxicology assessments to its Contract Research Services (CRS). Building upon the Company's FDA-recognized drug induced liver injury (DILI) assay, the expanded offering enables rapid, comparative studies between commonly used animal and human models to flag interspecies differences early, and better informs in vivo study design.

Traditional human in vitro methods have limited capacity to accurately determine drug toxicity. Added to this, the discrepancies between these methods and in vivo animal studies make it challenging to accurately predict safety risks for humans during preclinical testing. Often, unsafe drug candidates are wrongly progressed, and potentially life-saving ones are misclassified and abandoned, ultimately impacting clinical progression. In response to growing market demand for tools that address these concerns, CN Bio has expanded the in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) capabilities of its established PhysioMimix® DILI assay, adding the ability to easily compare results across human-, rat-, and dog-derived Liver-on-a-chip models. These assays offer a modernized workflow to generate predictive and actionable insights that mitigate the risk of costly, late-stage conflicting data, and reduce unnecessary animal use by providing early warning of hepatotoxicity/DILI prior to in vivo studies.

Accessible through the Company's CRS, the new offering harnesses the longstanding expertise of CN Bio's scientific team to provide detailed data analysis, optimized outcomes, and data-driven conclusions beyond what is achievable using existing in vitro models. The assay enables a broad range of longitudinal and endpoint testing for DILI-specific biomarkers from single- or repeat-dosing studies over a 14-day experimental window. This provides a more comprehensive overview of underlying mechanisms of hepatotoxicity or latent effects of drug candidates to improve IVIVE assessment and streamline clinical progression.

Understanding safety risks is critical to successful drug development, however, fundamental physiological and biological differences between species can lead to inaccuracies in predictions, often causing drug candidates to be wrongfully abandoned as toxic, or worse, mistakenly classified as safe.""

Dr Emily Richardson, Lead Scientist, Safety and Toxicology, CN Bio

She added: ""Having established our DILI assay as an industry leading option to garner more valuable insights across the development pipeline, we were in an ideal position to expand its capabilities and address this crucial gap in understanding hepatotoxicity using the most commonly used animal models. Partnering with us to utilize this powerful service not only ensures robust and reliable results but also provides access to a team of Organ-on-a-chip experts, who are invested in your success; to de-risk your pipeline and move it forward with confidence.""

The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has been awarded a $3.8 million grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a division of the National Institutes of Health, to study drug overdose cases linked to novel synthetic opioids. This work will help Emergency Department physicians better identify what substances people have taken, the severity of the overdose, and the best treatments to use in cases involving previously unknown or emergent drugs. This grant will be disbursed over five years.

Front-line doctors urgently need better tools and information to manage overdose cases, especially involving synthetic drugs. Our study will give them real-time data and insights from across the country, so they can deliver faster, more accurate care. This work will help emergency providers identify what substances people have taken, how serious the situation is, and what treatments are most likely to save lives, especially in overdose cases involving unknown or newly emerging drugs.""

Alex Manini, MD, MS, Principal Investigator, Professor of Emergency Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Director of Mount Sinai's Center for Research on Emerging Substances, Poisoning, Overdose, and New Discoveries

The country's opioid epidemic is expanding, with drug overdose deaths doubling from 2015 to 2023. For the first time ever, drug overdose deaths surpassed 108,000 in the United States in 2023, and more than 70 percent of these cases involved an opioid. The opioid epidemic costs the United States more than $1 trillion every year and accounts for nearly 3 million Emergency Department visits annually.

Initially, most illicit opioid overdoses were linked to heroin, but the changing face of global drug commerce introduced synthetic opioid fentanyl analogues into the drug supply. Now, these drugs have far surpassed heroin as the primary cause of overdose deaths. These highly potent novel synthetic opioids, along with psychoactive adulterants, are now commonly detected in the illicit opioid supply within the United States, creating a toxic drug supply with new drugs that most clinicians have never heard of. As a result, when patients overdose on these novel drugs, it is challenging for physicians to identify them in their system or to find the most effective treatment. Naloxone, which rapidly reverses the effects of opioid overdose, is typically used in emergency rooms in these cases, but doctors have concerns that it may take more naloxone to reverse the effects of these new opioids, and new adulterants may not respond to naloxone.

This new study aims to answer questions involving synthetic opioids. Mount Sinai will lead the research, which involves 10 high-volume hospital systems across the United States that are part of the national Toxicology Investigators Consortium, a division of the American College of Medical Toxicology created to detect new and emerging drugs of abuse, adverse effects of new medications in the post-marketing phase, and emerging toxicological threats.

During the study, patients who arrive at emergency departments with opioid overdose will be studied in terms of their course of illness, confirmation of ingested substances, clinical risk factors, and treatment needs. Toxicologists will use state-of-the-art technology to conduct molecular identification to confirm if novel fentanyl analogs, adulterants, and nitazenes - opioids that are more potent than fentanyl, and increasingly identified in the U.S. illicit opioid supply and undetectable by conventional fentanyl testing strips - are in their system. Researchers will also disseminate information regarding overdose outbreaks and trends to the public by partnering with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They will update study results onto the CDC's suspected opioid overdose dashboard.

""We aim to predict the effects of emerging synthetic opioids and get ahead of regional outbreaks, delivering timely alerts to doctors, public health agencies, and the public,"" adds Dr. Manini. ""When this study is complete, the field of drug abuse will be significantly advanced to allow prediction of medical consequences for thousands of victims of the U.S. opioid epidemic.""

Can synthetic biology deliver on its promise without repeating the ethical failures of past technologies? This new report maps the crossroads of innovation, risk, and responsibility, revealing what's at stake for our future.

Report: Ethical Challenges and Concerns in Synthetic Biology. Image Credit: sizsus art / Shutterstock

A recent report from Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy discussed the ethical concerns and challenges in synthetic biology (SynBio). SynBio is an interdisciplinary field of biology and engineering that manipulates DNA to design and redesign systems, such as biological pathways, genes, or organisms. SynBio tools are used to develop new medical therapies, break down chemicals, develop more sustainable fertilizers, and identify disease outbreaks. These new promises of innovation raise ethical challenges and questions about the use of SynBio products.

This report highlights six themes or areas related to ethical challenges associated with research and products of SynBio. These themes include the original sequence: 1) engineering life, 2) risks and potential benefits, 3) equity and distribution of risk, benefits, and access, 4) environmental ethics, 5) promises, speculations, and hype, and 6) research collaborations.

Open-source vs. patents changes who benefits: The report questions whether patenting synthetic organisms (like the minimal bacterial genomes attempted by the J. Craig Venter Institute) truly serves the public good, or if open models like BioBricks better share breakthroughs.

SynBio involves engineering life by generating new organisms or manipulating existing ones. This leads to discussions on the role of humans, including objections to “playing God,” concerns about potential implications of engineering life, and how SynBio products should be treated. Many people who invoke the “playing God” critique use it as grounds to reject a technology without further justification or explanation.

Merely interfering with nature or natural order is insufficient for rejecting technology. Besides, many widely accepted technologies allow human interference with nature, including interventions associated with creating life (in vitro fertilization) or manipulating natural order (selective breeding). The report also highlights that SynBio challenges existing classification systems and raises ontological questions about the identity and moral status of synthetic organisms. Some SynBio products may blur the line between ‘thing-like' and ‘person-like' entities, prompting debate over ownership, ethical treatment, and intellectual property rights. SynBio enables the creation of organisms that can mutate, adapt, or self-direct their evolutionary pathways. This unpredictability complicates regulatory oversight and risk assessment. The report further questions whether SynBio entities, such as brain organoids exhibiting cognition, deserve ethical protections beyond their designed functionality.

Understanding risk is pivotal to ethical SynBio work. Risk assessment involves considering both the potential benefits and harms associated with this work. Risk is a complex concept that involves uncertainty and requires analysis on multiple levels. It has five dimensions: identity, timing, probability, permanence, and value. Risks associated with biosecurity and biosafety are among the common risks in SynBio. Therefore, understanding security and safety concepts is crucial for addressing risks. Risk assessment in SynBio is an inherently normative activity embedded in social contexts, requiring multidisciplinary expert input and public engagement. The report outlines three major principles for managing risk: the precautionary principle (“better safe than sorry”), the reasonable risk principle (balancing risks with potential benefits), and the hopeful principle (assuming innovation is essential unless proven unsafe).

Economic disruption hits vulnerable communities: Real-world cases exist already, like semi-synthetic artemisinin production potentially displacing small farmers in Vietnam and China who cultivate Artemisia annua.

In general, risks are tolerated because of the potential benefits associated with activities that pose those risks. The potential benefits and applications of SynBio encompass healthcare and medicine, environmental remediation and pollution control, biofuel production and clean energy, innovation in basic research and development, industrial biomanufacturing, conservation and ecosystem resilience, as well as sustainable agriculture and food security. However, the report emphasizes that these are “potential” rather than guaranteed benefits, and considerable uncertainty often remains.

Common risks associated with SynBio include ecological or environmental risks, socioeconomic risks, risks to animals, and health and psychosocial risks to humans. A SynBio risk assessment model must account for multidisciplinary experts, whose insights should be relevant to identifying and assessing risks, as well as determining the appropriate response to both unknown and identified risks. Declarations of safety reflect normative judgments involving ethical decisions.

SynBio is often portrayed with optimism, providing solutions to societal problems. However, this portrayal assumes that any SynBio product will benefit society. Nonetheless, this assumption is challenged by differences in value systems, economic competitiveness, and differences in resource distribution and knowledge.

The integration of societal values in the research, development, and application of SynBio technology can promote either unjust or just distribution of its benefits and risks. Moreover, it is impossible to predict all potential ways a technology could affect social structures, making it difficult to address questions on attaining justice. Historical examples of unjust and inequitable distribution, as well as the effects of technology, could provide a roadmap of what must be avoided. The report notes that issues of ownership and intellectual property rights, such as patenting versus open-source models, can shape who benefits from SynBio. Historical injustices, like the exclusion of marginalized communities from research and technology, risk being perpetuated if not addressed deliberately. There is a need to ensure that historically marginalized populations are not again used as test subjects for new Synthetic Biology products.

""De-extinction"" sparks 'why' questions: Reviving species like the Woolly Mammoth isn't just about science – it forces us to ask if we should, and if it distracts from protecting existing ecosystems.

Anthropogenic climate change has led to biodiversity loss and the release of toxic byproducts. Consequently, SynBio is being used to develop products and tools to reverse these impacts, which include the development of genetically engineered microbes (for carbon capture, pollutant remediation, and biosensing), de-extinction efforts (to revive extinct species), and gene drive technology (to reduce species invasion).

However, these efforts raise ethical considerations about how environmental applications of technologies create new relationships and structures and impact ecosystems. Where the natural environment derives value is a central question to environmental ethics. The environment can be viewed as possessing both intrinsic and instrumental values. Instrumental value refers to how a non-human technology or environment serves human needs and interests.

Entities with intrinsic value are deemed worthy of respect beyond usefulness. Instrumental and inherent values influence the perception of the potential benefits, uses, and risks associated with environmental biotechnologies. These (values) also inform anthropocentric and ecocentric worldviews. Besides, meaningful consideration of environmental ethics and impacts of SynBio technologies requires an understanding of ecology and conservation. The report also explores concerns about diminishing “wildness” and respect for nature's intrinsic value, intergenerational justice for future people, and the “moral hazard” argument that reliance on SynBio solutions could delay more fundamental environmental action. The report questions whether restoration to ""unaffected"" environments is possible or even definable, highlighting how the idea of “wildness” is contested.

What makes a technology promising, and who decides it is worth pursuing? By referring to new technology as promising, it is implied that it will yield something positive, which may or may not occur. Labeling technology as promising may lead to hype. Promising is precarious since any promise about science and technology exists between imagination and reality. Therefore, promises must be treated with thoughtfulness and care.

Promising is essential in research to secure and sustain funding early. A vital aspect of promising science is how potential research outcomes are framed in the face of uncertainty. While uncertainty may justify the need for further research, it may also present some research projects as too risky from a hazards and financial perspective, thereby terminating their trajectory. Therefore, finding the best ways to portray uncertainty and do justice to potential benefits, while avoiding overpromising and exaggeration, is critical.

Scientists weigh risks using three principles: Facing uncertainty, researchers lean towards the Precautionary Principle (""better safe than sorry""), the Reasonable Risk Principle (balancing dangers with gains), or the Hopeful Principle (innovate unless proven unsafe).

Collaborations are a crucial part of research, with over 70% of research articles being collaborative with authors from multiple institutions. However, the multidisciplinary nature of SynBio work makes some collaborations more challenging. These challenges include ensuring adherence to scientific norms for data collection, analysis, and sharing, ascertaining and distributing credit for work, and working with animal and human subjects.

For effective collaboration, researchers must understand the cultures and standards of other disciplines. Furthermore, transnational collaborations are essential for developing guidelines, oversight, and governance that ensure the ethical development of research and products. However, these collaborations also generate ethical challenges as collaborators come from countries with distinct regulations, scientific cultures, and ethical norms. For example, political tensions such as the FBI's China Initiative exemplify how research security concerns can target specific ethnic groups and complicate international collaboration.

Together, SynBio represents an emerging discipline with the potential to reshape the world. The potential applications of SynBio could impact medicine, remediation, agriculture, and other fields. To ensure SynBio products are accessible and serve public interests, a strong understanding of people's ethical concerns is necessary. Researchers should consider regulatory challenges and regularly engage with the public and stakeholders to identify concerns and areas of conflict, thereby mitigating them.

A series of digital tests, carried out via a smartphone app, could enhance the detection of disease progression in Huntington's disease and improve the efficiency of clinical trials, finds research led by scientists at University College London (UCL) and Roche.

The research, published in Brain, highlights how digitising tests designed to measure the progression of motor symptoms in people with Huntington's disease can provide a sensitive and reliable way to track changes in the function of patients.

Once participants have completed five simple tests of movement control, including assessment of balance, finger tapping and involuntary movements, a Huntington's Disease Digital Motor Score (HDDMS) is calculated.

A lower HDDMS value indicates better motor function, while a higher HDDMS value indicates worse motor function.

By regularly performing the tests in their everyday lives, participants' disease progression can be monitored by doctors and researchers using the HDDMS.

The researchers hope that the HDDMS will help in clinical trials by allowing researchers to detect even small changes in symptoms – making it easier to evaluate the potential of new treatments.

It would also help researchers to detect disease changes with fewer participants, shortening study durations and potentially accelerating the development of new Huntington's disease therapies.

Our findings suggest that incorporating the HDDMS in clinical trials will help to give clearer answers about whether a potential treatment is working, with fewer participants or shorter lead times than conventional measures.

What's more, the fact that the HDDMS is evaluated in a five-minute assessment in people's homes makes it convenient and potentially more meaningful than in-clinic measures of motor impairment.""

Professor Ed Wild, UCL Huntington's Disease Centre

Huntington's disease is a devastating, inherited neurodegenerative condition causing progressive loss of movement control, thinking and behaviour. There is currently no cure and existing treatments mainly focus on managing symptoms rather than slowing or stopping the disease itself. Promising new therapies are undergoing clinical trials – making the efficiency and accuracy of the HDDMS more important than ever.

The HDDMS was developed by researchers at UCL and Roche using data collected from 1,048 people across four observational and interventional studies. From a large battery of novel digital tasks presented via a custom smartphone app, the researchers were able to distil the measurements that best predicted disease progression, resulting in the HDDMS battery.

By using the selected tests, the researchers found that the HDDMS was around twice as sensitive in detecting real changes in motor function as the currently most used clinical measure, the composite Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale.

Professor Wild added: ""More sensitive tools to measure disease progression are particularly valuable in rare diseases like Huntington's disease. The fewer people there are who can possibly participate in clinical trials, the more important it becomes to minimise trial burden and size.

""Sensitive measurement tools like the HDDMS may therefore facilitate Huntington's disease research across the scientific community.""

The new research underscores the growing role of digital biomarkers in neurological research and highlights the potential for technology-driven innovations in disease monitoring and drug development.

The HDDMS is available to academic and industry parties working on Huntington's disease via Roche Diagnostics.

The research has some limitations, including that all data has been collected from people participating in specific clinical trials. Therefore, the HDDMS has not been evaluated in people before symptoms onset, nor in people with advanced HD.

Additionally, while the HDDMS is sensitive to changes, more research is needed to confirm its ability to predict long-term functional decline.

When her smartwatch flagged new heart changes, a retired nurse listened, and hospital tests revealed a rare but dangerous stress-induced heart condition, reinforcing the promise and pitfalls of wearable health tech.

Case Study: Cardiac Injury Detected by Smartwatch. Image Credit: vectorfusionart / Shutterstock

In a new case study, a smartwatch helped detect a cardiovascular event in a 76-year-old patient. A recent New England Journal of Medicine report documents a cardiovascular event experienced by a retired nurse who presented to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain following severe emotional distress, and whose abnormal ECG findings were first detected using her smartwatch.

A 76-year-old retired cardiovascular nurse presented to the ED with a two-hour history of chest pain, triggered by severe emotional distress and associated with abnormal ECG changes recorded on her smartwatch. Her physical examination was normal. A single-channel smartwatch ECG, corresponding to lead I on a 12-lead ECG, exhibited new T-wave inversions and a lower QRS amplitude that was not present at her baseline recording one month earlier. A standard 12-lead ECG performed in the hospital revealed new T-wave inversions and subtle ST-segment elevation in the V3 lead, compared with her baseline ECG from two years earlier.

The patient's high-sensitivity troponin T level was measured as 205 ng per liter, where the reference range was between 6 and 10. Despite the elevated troponin T level, a coronary angiogram showed unobstructed coronary arteries. Echocardiography revealed left ventricular apical ballooning with an ejection fraction of 35%. Considering the clinical assessments, clinicians diagnosed the patient with takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as “broken heart syndrome,” is a temporary heart condition that mimics a heart attack. It is typically triggered by severe emotional or physical stress and predominantly affects older women. Although symptoms can be dramatic, most patients recover fully with appropriate management.

Most commercially available smartwatches can record a single-lead ECG, providing helpful information about heart rhythm. However, these devices do not offer the comprehensive data of a standard 12-lead ECG, which is required to diagnose most cardiac events. In the United States, smartwatch ECGs are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for detecting atrial fibrillation, but not for diagnosing heart attacks or takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It is worth noting that even though the nurse used her smartwatch to identify changes suggestive of cardiac injury, smartwatch ECGs are not approved for this indication.

Diagnosis and management relied on conventional clinical tools, including a 12-lead ECG, blood tests, coronary angiography, and echocardiography. After diagnosis, the patient was treated with a beta-blocker and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Follow-up, at six weeks, the patient reported feeling well, and a repeat echocardiogram was normal.

This case highlights the potential for wearable technology to prompt timely medical attention for cardiovascular symptoms. However, it also underscores that the diagnosis and management of heart conditions must be guided by medical professionals using validated equipment.

Patients should view smartwatch data as an early warning, not a substitute for professional assessment. As a retired cardiovascular nurse, the patient's familiarity with heart disease likely contributed to her decision to seek prompt care. Her awareness and timely action may have led to a better outcome.

Ongoing research is focused on enhancing the accuracy and clinical applicability of wearable cardiac monitoring devices. Advances in artificial intelligence and sensor technology may expand the role of smartwatches in detecting cardiac events, but for now, their main benefit remains as a supplementary alert rather than a diagnostic tool.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Addressing inaccurate race and ethnicity data in medical AI","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250609/Addressing-inaccurate-race-and-ethnicity-data-in-medical-AI.aspx","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 00:17:00 GMT","

The inaccuracy of race and ethnicity data found in electronic health records (EHRs) can negatively impact patient care as artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into healthcare. Because hospitals and providers inconsistently collect such data and struggle to accurately classify individual patients, AI systems trained on these datasets can inherit and perpetuate racial bias.

In a new publication in PLOS Digital Health, experts in bioethics and law call for immediate standardization of methods for collection of race and ethnicity data, and for developers to warranty race and ethnicity data quality in medical AI systems. The research synthesizes concerns about why patient race data in EHRs may not be accurate, identifies best practices for healthcare systems and medical AI researchers to improve data accuracy, and provides a new template for medical AI developers to transparently warrant the quality of their race and ethnicity data

Lead author Alexandra Tsalidis, MBE, notes that ""If AI developers heed our recommendation to disclose how their race and ethnicity data were collected, they will not only advance transparency in medical AI but also help patients and regulators critically assess the safety of the resulting medical devices. Just as nutrition labels inform consumers about what they're putting into their bodies, these disclaimers can reveal the quality and origins of the data used to train AI-based health care tools.""

Race bias in AI models is a huge concern as the technology is increasingly integrated into healthcare. This article provides a concrete method that can be implemented to help address these concerns.""

Francis Shen, JD, PhD, senior author 

While more work needs to be done, the article offers a starting point suggests co-author Lakshmi Bharadwaj, MBE. ""An open dialogue regarding best practices is a vital step, and the approaches we suggest could generate significant improvements.""

The research was supported by the NIH Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) program, and by an NIH BRAIN Neuroethics grant (R01MH134144).

A global analysis of over 314,000 food items found that hyper-palatable foods, engineered to drive overeating, are widespread in the US and Europe, but especially prevalent in the US and Bulgaria. Countries like Italy and Germany offer healthier food environments, while the US leads in foods high in fat, sugar, and sodium.

In a recent study published in the journal PLoS ONE, researchers at the University of Kansas, USA, analyzed the prevalence and nutrient composition of hyper-palatable foods (HPFs) across 17 countries using crowdsourced data.

Can a combination of fat, salt, and sugar make food irresistible? Research suggests it can. HPFs, which are engineered with specific levels of fat, sugar, and sodium, appear to activate the brain's reward systems in a way that drives overeating and contributes to obesity. These foods can trigger a desire to eat that is not based on hunger, but rather on the stimulation of reward pathways. It is important to note that ‘wanting' (the motivation to eat) and ‘liking' (the sensory pleasure of eating) are considered distinct in neuroscience, with HPFs particularly implicated in increased ‘wanting' that drives excess intake. Although most studies focus on the United States (US), multinational food companies operate globally. To understand how food environments around the world are shaped, further research using international data is urgently needed.

Salty snacks dominated HPF worldwide – Nearly 70% of items in this category met hyper-palatable criteria across all countries, outperforming even sugary snacks.

Researchers used the Open Food Facts database, a globally crowdsourced repository of food data, to evaluate food products from 17 countries across North America, Europe, and South America. After removing beverages and incomplete entries, the final dataset included 314,229 unique food items. Foods were classified as hyper-palatable based on a standardized definition that includes three nutrient combinations: fat and sodium (FSOD), fat and sugar (FS), and carbohydrate and sodium (CSOD), each with specific quantitative thresholds.

The study also employed the NOVA food classification system, which categorizes foods based on their processing level. Foods with a NOVA score of 4 were classified as ultra-processed foods (UPFs). Only countries with more than 1,000 food items were included in the analysis. The US was used as a reference due to its documented high prevalence of hyper-palatable foods.

All data were examined for quality, and implausible entries were excluded. Researchers applied logistic and ordered beta regression models to compare the likelihood and nutrient composition of HPFs across countries. They also assessed how much overlap existed between hyper-palatable and UPF items. Data visualization techniques, including stacked bar plots, were used to illustrate national differences. All analyses were performed using R software.

It is important to emphasize that, due to the crowdsourced nature of the Open Food Facts database and variable product counts across countries and food categories, these results are not nationally representative. The data are more robust for countries with higher submission rates, which are primarily in Western Europe and North America.

Bulgaria broke food category trends – Unlike other nations where fruits/vegetables rarely qualified as HPF, half of Bulgaria's items in this category met hyper-palatable thresholds.

The dataset included food items from 17 countries. The US contributed nearly half of the total items. France, Italy, Germany, and Spain were also major contributors. Foods high in carbohydrates, such as sugary snacks and cereals, represented almost half of the total items analyzed.

HPFs were common in all countries, ranging from 54.5% of food items in Australia to almost 68% in Bulgaria. The US had one of the highest proportions at 63 percent. The most common nutrient combination among HPF was FSOD, followed by FS and CSOD.

Statistical models indicated that food items from most countries were less likely to be classified as HPF compared to those from the United States. Bulgaria had the highest prevalence of HPF and was the only country with higher odds. Switzerland had a statistically similar proportion to the US. Italy and Germany had significantly lower proportions of HPF items. The nutrient composition of HPF items also varied across countries. Foods from the US typically contain higher levels of palatability-related nutrients, such as fat, sugar, carbohydrates, and sodium compared to those from other countries.

On average, HPF items exceeded their classification thresholds by large margins. FSOD items exceeded the criteria by 116% and 131%, respectively. FS items surpassed their thresholds by 106% and 70%. CSOD items exceeded their respective criteria by 40% and 229%.

The study also examined the overlap between HPF and UPFs, defined using the NOVA classification system. In the US, 50% of food items were classified as both. Bulgaria had a large percentage of HPF-only foods. Italy had the highest proportion of foods that were neither HPF nor ultra-processed at nearly 29%.

Food type played a major role. Sugary snacks, salty snacks, and dairy products often qualify as both HPF and ultra-processed. Fruits and vegetables were rarely classified as either. Some products, such as salty snacks and meats, were frequently HPF only. Others, such as cereals and sauces, were usually ultra-processed but not HPF. These distinctions highlight the importance of analyzing both categories separately. The study authors note that, while HPF and UPF categories can overlap, especially in the US, they are conceptually and nutritionally distinct, and their risks to health may differ.

Overall, the US food supply had more hyper-palatable items with higher levels of palatability-related nutrients. In contrast, countries like Italy and Germany had healthier food environments.

US items surpassed thresholds most aggressively – American HPF averaged 106-229% beyond classification cutoffs, while other nations' items hovered closer to minimum requirements.

To summarize, this study revealed significant differences in the availability and composition of palatability-related nutrients in HPFs across countries. The US had the highest prevalence and most extreme formulation of these nutrients, while countries like Italy and Germany had more favorable profiles. Bulgaria had the highest HPF prevalence, and Switzerland was statistically similar to the US in this respect.

The authors emphasize that foods classified as both hyper-palatable and ultra-processed, as defined by the NOVA classification system, may present a particularly high health risk compared to foods that are only one or the other. These findings support the need for targeted public health strategies, including the reformulation of food products and improved labeling. They also suggest policy interventions could include reducing the palatability-driving nutrient content of foods, changing their placement in stores, or even restricting sales or advertising to certain populations, as part of efforts to reshape food environments linked to obesity risk. Understanding how these foods are distributed across global markets can help shape more effective responses to rising rates of obesity and diet-related diseases.

However, the authors caution that because the Open Food Facts database is crowdsourced and not evenly representative across countries or food categories, the findings reflect patterns in the available dataset and not definitive national estimates. Broader international data collection would be needed for representative country-level conclusions.

The Canadian Indigenous Nurses Association (CINA) and the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR) today announced a new partnership to include Indigenous priorities in cancer research, build capacity for research with and within First Nations, Inuit, and Métis (FNIM) communities, and increase research participation to ultimately reduce the burden of cancers within these populations.

The organizations agree on the need to identify the unique cancer-related priorities of FNIM populations by supporting the training and advancement of Indigenous individuals working in cancer research and addressing cancer research questions relevant to FNIM communities. Through these actions CINA and OICR will enable understanding and application of Indigenous-specific contexts to conducting cancer research.

As the longest-standing national Indigenous healthcare provider organization in Canada, CINA is well positioned to support and conduct research with FNIM communities, organizations, and researchers. As the province's cancer research institute, OICR seeks to include Indigenous communities in its research activities so that its work is reflective of Ontario's diversity and is done in a manner that acknowledges and respects the cultural values of FNIM populations.

Examples of proposed activities include creating and supporting specialized training and education opportunities, CINA advising OICR on matters related to Indigenous cancer research and establishing an open dialogue to ensure that the priorities of FNIM communities are reflected in cancer research.

This is truly an exciting time to address the network of cancer research needed for Indigenous people. At CINA, the opportunity to work with our partners, especially the dedicated team at OICR, is a true indication of the impacts of partnerships and building the content focussed on Indigenous Cancer. The window of opportunity to engage Indigenous healthcare provider organizations is a unique design that will demonstrate the Indigenous indicators in collaboration with mainstream stakeholders.""

Lea Bill, President of CINA and Dr. Angeline Letendre, Vice President

""We are thrilled to be partnering with CINA to advance cancer research with and within First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities,"" says Dr. Christine Williams, Acting President of OICR. ""Through this connection we will be able to work collaboratively to reduce the toll of cancer in Indigenous communities and help ensure that Indigenous cancer researchers are at the forefront of those efforts.""

""Our province is producing ground-breaking cancer research discoveries that save lives every day,"" says Nolan Quinn, Minister of Colleges, Universities, Research Excellence and Security. ""This partnership between the Canadian Indigenous Nurses Association and the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research will advance Indigenous-specific cancer research so that First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities can continue to live healthy and happy lives.""

Tagomics Ltd., a pioneering biomarker discovery and diagnostics company, today announced it has been awarded £860 k Innovate UK funding as part of the Biomedical Catalyst program for the testing and development of innovative healthcare solutions from Innovate UK, the UK's innovation agency, with the remaining funding contributed by Tagomics. The funding will support the customization of Tagomics's Interlace platform to develop a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic test for the early detection and treatment of colorectal cancer, and subsequent pilot study with the NHS.

Tagomics' Interlace platform is a novel multiomics workflow that unlocks disease-associated DNA biomarkers, leveraging a unique approach to epigenetic profiling which enriches unmethylated DNA for analysis without modifying the underlying DNA sequence. The Biomedical Catalyst grant will be used to apply Interlace to the detection of genetic and epigenetic mutations associated with colorectal cancer, including the development of new models for the analysis of patient multiomic profiles and identification of new disease biomarkers.

A pilot study of the diagnostic test for the early detection of colorectal cancer in a clinical patient cohort will be led by Dr Arash Assadsangabi, Consultant physician and Gastroenterologist at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, in collaboration with the Northern Care Alliance Research Collection biobank. The study will profile 250 patients suspected of having colorectal cancer to validate identified biomarkers and demonstrate the use of multiomic profiling for early detection of disease.

We are delighted to have been awarded the Biomedical Catalyst grant as part of the Innovate UK program, recognizing the potential of our multiomic workflow in novel diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. We believe that the unique, information-rich dataset that Interlace provides us will be pivotal in detecting colorectal cancer at the earliest possible stages of development, enabling treatment of the cancer when it is most vulnerable to modern therapeutics, with the aim of dramatically improving patient outcomes.""

Dr Robert Neely, CSO and co-founder of Tagomics

Following successful completion of the project, Tagomics will further expand the capabilities and applications of Interlace with the support of Agilent Technologies, building on the Companies' established partnership that was key to the early development of the Interlace platform.

Dr Rita Shaknovich, Chief Medical Officer at Agilent Technologies, commented: ""The Biomedical Catalyst grant is a fantastic achievement for Tagomics, reflecting the enormous potential for its novel multiomics workflow in the early detection of cancers. We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Tagomics and supporting the development of new applications for the Interlace platform, which brings together the strengths of Tagomics' epigenetics platform with Agilent's SureSelect target enrichment solutions, furthering cancer research and ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Symptom asymmetry influences how Parkinson's patients process emotions","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250610/Symptom-asymmetry-influences-how-Parkinsone28099s-patients-process-emotions.aspx","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 15:52:00 GMT","

New study shows dopamine treatments and symptom asymmetry impact patients differently.

A new study in Neurodegenerative Diseases looks closely at how Parkinson's disease can affect something as everyday and essential as recognizing emotion in someone's voice. The research suggests that both the side of the body most affected by symptoms and the medications used to treat those symptoms may influence how patients interpret vocal emotion.

Researchers from the University of Geneva and Rennes University Hospital studied how people with Parkinson's disease are able to recognize different emotions when hearing speech recordings. Participants were grouped based on whether their physical symptoms were more prominent on the left or right side of the body. The study included individuals in both early and advanced stages of the disease, with early-stage participants tested on and off dopaminergic replacement therapy (DRT).

The results were striking. The authors wrote, ""patients with a predominance of left-sided symptoms"" had more difficulty recognizing vocal emotions than both healthy controls and patients with right-sided symptoms.

The role of treatment also stood out. In the early-stage group, the researchers found ""a deleterious effect of DRT on the recognition of vocal emotions for the patients with left-predominant symptoms, and the inverse pattern (i.e., a positive effect of DRT) for the patients with right-predominant symptoms.""

This suggests that the side of symptom onset may affect how DRT interacts with the brain's emotion-processing systems. While the sample size was small, the study points to the value of a more individualized approach to care. As the authors put it, ""These results bring to knowledge the differential effects of disease duration, DRT and motor symptom asymmetry on vocal emotion recognition in Parkinson's disease.""

""Based on converging results, they propose that asymmetry is a key feature of the disease and should be taken into account at all stages of Parkinson's, especially when evaluating current and future treatment strategies,"" says Professor Julie Péron, Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology Laboratory (CENLab), University of Geneva. ""The team also emphasizes the importance of replication across independent studies to strengthen the reliability and generalizability of these findings, and to further advance personalized approaches to care.""

This research invites us to think beyond movement symptoms and consider how Parkinson's affects communication, connection, and emotional understanding.

Cancer remains one of the most pressing global health challenges, with millions of new diagnoses each year. While precision medicine and targeted therapies have transformed treatment strategies, many patients still face drug resistance and disease recurrence. A new review published in Genes & Diseases highlights the critical role of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, offering a powerful preclinical platform that more accurately mimics human tumors. These models could revolutionize drug development, improve treatment efficacy, and guide personalized therapies.

PDX models are created by implanting patient-derived tumor tissue into immunodeficient mice, preserving essential features such as tumor genetics, microenvironment, and drug response patterns. Unlike traditional cancer models, which rely on cell lines, PDX models provide a more faithful representation of the complexity of human cancer, making them a superior tool for testing novel therapies before they reach clinical trials.

A key advantage of PDX models is their ability to support co-clinical trials, where patients and their corresponding PDX models are treated in parallel. This approach allows researchers to evaluate treatment responses in real time, helping to identify the most effective therapies for individual patients. These models have already demonstrated significant promise in areas such as breast, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer research.

Despite their potential, PDX models face several challenges that need to be addressed to maximize their impact. High costs, long development times, and the need for highly specialized facilities are among the barriers to widespread adoption. Additionally, tumor evolution within PDX models may not always mirror the progression of cancer in human patients, posing limitations for long-term studies.

To overcome these obstacles, scientists are actively working on next-generation PDX models, incorporating technologies such as CRISPR gene editing, organoid co-cultures, and humanized mouse models. These innovations aim to enhance the reliability and scalability of PDX systems, accelerating the development of breakthrough cancer therapies.

With ongoing advancements in biobanking and artificial intelligence-driven drug discovery, PDX models are expected to become an indispensable tool in precision oncology.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","CT colonography outperforms stool DNA testing in cost and effectiveness","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250610/CT-colonography-outperforms-stool-DNA-testing-in-cost-and-effectiveness.aspx","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 16:36:00 GMT","

Compared to stool DNA testing, researchers found that CT colonography is a cost-saving and clinically effective method for colorectal cancer screening, according to a study was published today in Radiology, a journal of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death globally. Routine screening of the colon and rectum can aid in the detection and removal of precancerous polyps, mitigating the need for advanced-stage cancer treatments and the added costs associated with said treatments.

Due to the disturbing trend of colorectal cancer diagnoses in younger patients, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and multiple medical societies have lowered the recommended age for colorectal cancer screening to 45 years of age.

In the U.S., conventional colonoscopy remains the dominant screening test for colorectal cancer, despite the fact that it is the most expensive and invasive option.""

Perry J. Pickhardt, M.D., study author, the John R. Cameron professor of radiology and medical physics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison

Dr. Pickhardt notes that optical colonoscopy is the preferred method of colorectal cancer screening due to its cancer prevention abilities in removing benign precancerous polyps during the procedure. However, less invasive and less expensive screening methods have become more accessible due to recent Medicare coverage expansions. 

Multitarget stool DNA (mt-sDNA), which analyzes stool samples for specific colorectal cancer biomarkers, and CT colonography, which uses CT scans to examine the colon and rectum for cancer or polyps, are both now covered procedures for Medicare recipients.

According to Dr. Pickhardt, both stool DNA testing and CT colonography are less invasive and much safer primary screening options. However, with two inherently different screening methods, Dr. Pickhardt and colleagues set out to analyze mt-sDNA and CT colonography in a head-to-head comparison of clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness.

The researchers used a Markov model to simulate the progression of colorectal disease in a model of 10,000 45-year-olds. The simulation period was divided into one-year intervals, and simulated individuals were assigned health states based on the presence or absence of colorectal lesions of varying sizes.

Screening and surveillance on the simulated population began at 45 years and ended at 75 years of age, in which participants assumed perfect adherence to screening, diagnostic follow-ups and recommendations.

Consistent with current studies, 7.5% of the study population developed colorectal cancer in the absence of screening.

While both screening methods were clinically effective compared to no screening, CT colonography demonstrated a higher reduction of colorectal cancer incidence of 70 to 75%, compared to the 59% reduction achieved by mt-sDNA.

To assess the cost-effectiveness of the screening methods, Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) was used to measure the value of the medical intervention, with one QALY equaling one year of perfect health.

In this analysis, mt-sDNA screening was found to be cost-effective relative to no screening, with an estimated cost of nearly $9,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained (QALY), well below the selected threshold of $100,000. However, conventional CT colonography screening was found to be cost saving relative to no screening.

Since advanced polyps that are larger than 10 millimeters are the primary target of colorectal cancer prevention, the study demonstrated the potential success for a hybrid approach to cancer screening, with a three-year surveillance for small colorectal polyps via CT colonography and colonoscopy referral for large polyps.

When the conventional CT colonography screening strategy of referring patients with detected polyps greater or equal to 6 mm in size for colonoscopy was compared with the hybrid strategy that included 3-year surveillance for small (6–9 mm) polyps, the former was not cost-effective relative to the latter strategy. This result was driven primarily by the higher costs related to colonoscopy referral for small polyps, which was not sufficiently offset by the corresponding small incremental gain in QALYs. A strategy consisting of 3-year surveillance for small colorectal polyps and colonoscopy referral for large polyps achieved the best overall balance.

""Among the safe, minimally invasive colorectal cancer screening options, CT colonography is more effective at preventing and detecting cancer-and is also more cost-effective-than stool DNA testing,"" Dr. Pickhardt said. ""Furthermore, CT colonography can provide for extracolonic screening for things like osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease.""

""CT Colonography versus Multitarget Stool DNA Test for Colorectal Cancer Screening: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis."" Collaborating with Dr. Pickhardt were Loredana Correale, Ph.D., and Cesare Hassan, M.D.

CARY, N.C. — Former U.S. women's national team stars Carli Lloyd, Ali Krieger, Heather O'Reilly, and the US Women claimed their second consecutive $1 million prize in The Soccer Tournament's women's bracket on Monday. Despite falling short in the women's final, Bumpy Pitch FC emerged victorious in the men's championship game, taking home the $1 million prize in front of a sold-out crowd.

Looking to repeat their triumph from the inaugural women's event last summer, the US Women reloaded with additional USWNT veterans and five current players from the University of North Carolina. After joining the staff as an assistant coach in 2024, Lloyd returned to the field as a player for TST 2025, marking her first competitive appearance since retiring in 2021. Lloyd scored two goals in the tournament, including the game-winning goal in Target Score Time against Streetball FC Canada to send US Women to the semifinals.

US Women controlled the final from start to finish, defeating Bumpy Pitch FC Women, 3-0. Evelyn Shores slotted home the winning goal off a O'Reilly assist 13 minutes into Target Score Time to secure the team's second straight title.

The women's bracket all-tournament team included: Hope Solo (Solo FC), Carli Lloyd (US Women), Bella Devey (US Women), Mia Shim (US Women), Giana Riley (Bumpy Pitch FC), Maci Teater (Ultrain FC), and Katie Shea Collins (Solo FC).

In the men's final, Bumpy Pitch FC defeated Pumas de Alabama, 2-1. Trailing 1-0 entering Target Score Time, Bumpy Pitch capitalized on mistakes from Pumas de Alabama, scoring two goals — including the $1 million winner from Charlie Gonzalez.

The men's bracket all-tournament team included: Sergio Agüero (Seleccion Potrero), Oumar Niasse (Pasha Luxury FC), Ricardinho (Nani FC), Drew Ruggles (The CONCAFA SC), Jose Antonio Medina Alvarado (Pumas de Alabama), Cristian Martinez Borja (Bumpy Pitch FC), and Hugo Gomez (Bumpy Pitch FC).

The Soccer Tournament welcomed more than 50,000 attendees over six days, and featured players from 34 countries.

The US Women are back-to-back winners of the $1 million The Soccer Tournament (TST) prize thanks to a goal from 20-year-old University of North Carolina midfielder Evelyn Shores. The US Women won 3-0 against Bumpy Pitch FC on Monday in target score time.

“I feel so surreal. It was such a team effort. This has been so fun all around. I'm just so glad I could help us win it,” Shores said after the win. “They've been great this entire week, just getting us in the team, making us feel comfortable.”

The seven-a-side, winner-takes-all competition has become a playground for former and young players alike. And thanks to captain Heather O'Reilly, it's become a regular chance for USWNT legends to make their return.

After winning the tournament last year, O'Reilly again assembled a team that included Carli Lloyd, Ali Krieger and Jill Loyden among five UNC players, including Shores.

Founded by TBT Enterprises, which also created The Basketball Tournament, TST has grown from a quirky offseason tournament into a potential model for a fast-paced version of soccer mostly consumed by younger fans. The tournament was unveiled in 2022 with 32 men's teams. TST added the women's tournament in 2024 and doubled the size of the women's side this year, expanding from eight to 16 teams after receiving more than 50 applications. The tournament signed a broadcast deal with ESPN and, on the women's side, signed with RBC Wealth Management as the main sponsor.

In its third year, 48 men's and 16 women's teams competed in games played on a smaller field with a fast-paced format designed to maximize entertainment. The games didn't end after full time, either. With the target score time reached, the game finished with both teams trying to reach a score determined by adding one to the leading team's score after the full-time whistle. In target score time, players are slowly taken off the field until they reach 2v2, if necessary.

With 4-on-4 and up 2-0, O'Reilly found the foot of Shores for the winning goal.

The goal adds to Shore's recent success, which includes being the only college player called into the USWNT under-23 camp last month and scoring the winning goal in the team's friendly against Germany on May 30.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","The US men's national team has more of the last thing it needs: sports dad drama","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/10/christian-pulisic-landon-donovan","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 13:47:00 GMT","

The continued fallout from Christian Pulisic's decision not to join the USMNT this summer has exposed the incestuousness of elite soccer in the United States

The United States men's national team need a number of things. Some wins, after losing three straight games from March's Concacaf Nations League through Saturday's 2-1 loss to Turkey. A bit of momentum or indeed excitement for next year's World Cup on home soil. A clear identity, or at least a rediscovery of the kind of grit that once made this team competitive. A goalscorer.

The one thing the Americans do not need is another episode of parent-driven drama. But that's what they have.

Almost two and a half years on, US Soccer is still feeling the ripple effects from the Reyna Brouhaha. After the 2022 World Cup, Gio Reyna's parents, both former national teamers, set off a scandal when they told the federation about a decades-old domestic violence incident between then-head coach Gregg Berhalter and his wife when they were in college, triggering an investigation. The Reynas were reportedly upset about Gio's limited playing time in Qatar, and Berhalter's subsequent airing of the player's lack of effort in training.

Berhalter was ultimately cleared of further wrongdoing and rehired, but the national team played for a pair of interim coaches for half a year and have never recovered the velocity they built up during Berhalter's first World Cup cycle, leading to a poor Copa América showing and the coach's ouster last summer. Reyna's career, meanwhile, has stalled, and could have benefited from the spotlight of the World Cup.

Mark Pulisic, a former professional indoor player and coach and the father of the USMNT's best player, Christian Pulisic, added another chapter to the parental behavior files on Sunday.

It started when Landon Donovan lauded the 40-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo for his effort with Portugal in Sunday's Uefa Nations League final: “I can't help but think about our guys on vacation, not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. It's pissing me off,” said Donovan, who was covering the game for Fox Sports.

It was an apparent jibe at the younger Pulisic, who asked to be left out of the USMNT's Gold Cup campaign after a long club season with Milan and ahead of a World Cup year. The general complaint was not new; Donovan said similar things on his podcast in May. But on Fox, they were put squarely into the spotlight.

In response, the elder Pulisic took to his private account on Instagram, posting an image of a ChatGPT response about Donovan taking a sabbatical from soccer in 2013. “This guy is talking about commitment,” Mark Pulisic wrote in the caption. “Look in the mirror + grow a pair and call names out or are you afraid next time you want an interview you will get rejected again.”

Christian Pulisic liked the post.

A few different things are true here, and they all speak to the current condition of the American men's game. For a start, the Pulisics are being thin-skinned. Fellow national team star Weston McKennie showed understanding for Pulisic's summer break. “Any chance that we get, we want to play,” the Juventus midfielder, who will also miss the Gold Cup while in action at the Club World Cup, told USA Today. “But obviously, if you don't feel like your body is in the right condition, and you don't feel like your body is in the best form or shape or whatever, to be able to do that at 100%, and you feel like you're risking injury, then it's better to let someone else go in that is completely 100%.”

Tyler Adams, who is in camp with the national team, has said he is fine with Pulisic's absence. So is US Soccer, at least publicly. “After thoughtful discussions and careful consideration, we made the collective decision that this is the right moment for him to get the rest he needs,” the federation's sporting director, Matt Crocker, said of Pulisic upon the roster announcement.

So why should the Pulisics care what a TV pundit – albeit one of the USMNT's best ever player – says about Christian's choices?

The whole thing also reflects the incestuousness of elite soccer in the United States, where everybody knows everyone and has for decades. Squabbles are never quite as superficial as they seem here, often harkening back to ancient grievances. The public nature of social media (even private accounts) is an accelerant. Beyond the aforementioned Reynas, Mark Pulisic is not the only USMNT dad who is very online.

It's also valid to point out that Donovan and the other critical members of the punditocracy may not entirely understand what it's like to be in Christian Pulisic's shoes. Donovan took his own sabbatical and has acknowledged how taxing it is to be the face of the national team. “I understand very clearly what it's like to need a break,” Donovan said on his podcast in May.

Yet Donovan never played a full European season as a first-team regular. He was never a leading player for one of the continent's most regal teams in a grueling league like Italy's Serie A, relied upon several times a week to win games while his team is expected to compete in four competitions, including the Champions League. Pulisic not only did all of that, but he was Milan's leading scorer in his best season yet.

(As an aside, this is also where the comparison to Ronaldo falls apart, since the latter played his club soccer in the much gentler Saudi Arabian league this season.)

However you tally up insults and umbrage, there is no escaping the conclusion that the timing of it all is particularly unfortunate. The USMNT, after all, are about to embark on a summer tournament in which they hope to move on the from all the recent dysfunction at last. Now they have even more of it, and the player in question isn't even in camp.

The U.S. men's national team is back on the pitch on Tuesday night, taking on Switzerland in an international friendly in Nashville, ahead of opening its 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup against Trinidad and Tobago in San Jose on Sunday. 

Head coach Mauricio Pochettino's side comes into the game off a disheartening 2–1 loss to Turkey, where defensive blunders cost them an otherwise promising day, which began with a left-footed curling strike from the top of the box by Houston Dynamo midfielder Jack McGlynn. 

Two starts and two long-distance lasers from Jack McGlynn. 💥💥He's just the third #USMNT player in the last 30 years to score his first two goals from outside the penalty area! pic.twitter.com/RUviUy9bp8

That loss marked the second time in the last year that the USMNT had dropped three straight matches, and the first time since 2015, during the tenure of Jürgen Klinsmann, that a single coach had led them to such a spell.

Against Switzerland, they will hope to avoid a four-game losing streak, a skid they have not experienced since a five-game losing streak in 2007.

They will also have to do it without AFC Bournemouth's Tyler Adams, who will be unavailable after picking up a knock against Turkey. While Pochettino will have several options, one player who could slide into his midfield role is Vancouver Whitecaps FC midfielder Sebastian Berhalter, who has enjoyed a standout MLS campaign.

The U.S. Men's National Team faces another European test in the second of two friendlies this window when it takes on Switzerland on Tuesday, June 10.

The match kicks off from Nashville, Tenn. at 7 p.m. CT / 8 p.m. ET on Tuesday (TNT, truTV and Max; Peacock in Spanish; Westwood One Sports on radio).

 In less than a week's time, the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup Group Stage will commence. The USA fell short to Türkiye in its first friendly but will get one final tune-up before heading to the tournament.

 “I think the focus [against Switzerland] is more in the process to improve than maybe the result,” head coach Mauricio Pochettino said. “And of course, the Gold Cup is going to be about progression and result.” 

 Pochettino urged his group to look ahead after falling to Türkiye 2-1 in the team's first June friendly. The U.S. conceded those two goals in a three-minute span, but Pochettino is more concerned with how his team responds.

 “The most important action is the next one,” Pochettino said.

 At this stage, Pochettino feels more concerned with the process than the result, especially with the number of young players on the team. The announced roster for the June friendlies featured six uncapped players.. The previous match's starting lineup averaged just 13 caps.

 “You need to feel the confidence from us to say, ‘If I made a mistake, it's part of my game. It's part of the sport,'” Pochettino said.

 2. Gold Cup Send-Off

 As the friendlies wrap up, the U.S. heads to the Gold Cup. The match in Nashville will send the National Team off to the biennial tournament.

 The USMNT drew Group D in April with Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti filling out the group. The tournament group stage begins June 15, and the U.S. will face those opponents in that respective order.

The U.S. last won the Gold Cup trophy in 2021. The Americans also faced Switzerland in the lead-up to their victorious run that same year. Mexico claimed the most recent title in 2023, but the U.S. looks to reclaim its reign as Pochettino searches to win his first international tournament as USMNT head coach. 

 Defender Walker Zimmerman is familiar with GEODIS Park. As captain of Nashville SC, his likeness is plastered around the stadium.

 Zimmerman may have been a late roster addition, but the veteran has provided leadership to a relatively young squad. He was one of 26 players chosen for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and has accumulated 43 caps and three goals in his international career.

 “It's a very positive leadership that he [provides] to the team,” Pochettino said. “I think that is really good, and I think we are so happy to have him, and maybe tomorrow [he'll] have the possibility to play.”

 If Zimmerman makes an appearance, it'll be his first National Team cap in his club's stadium. The USMNT last played in Nashville in 2023 in a 4-0 win over Ghana. Zimmerman has been a center back for Nashville SC, currently No. 4 in the MLS Eastern Conference, since 2020. 

 The goalkeeper position is one to keep an eye on. In 2025, four different players have started goal: Patrick Schulte, Zack Steffen, Matt Turner and Matt Freese.

 Turner and Freese are two of three ‘keepers on the Gold Cup roster, along with Chris Brady. Schulte and Steffen started the June camp, but both sustained injuries that will keep them out of the biennial cup.

 Freese earned his first cap in the match against Türkiye, allowing two goals. Turner is the most senior player at the position with 51 appearances, including in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Brady is still uncapped. With the 2026 World Cup in view, the front-runner for the position will continue to evolve, and this summer could help determine that.

 In nine matches between the two countries, the Americans have fallen to and drawn Switzerland four times each (1W-4L-4D). The sole win came in October 2007 in a 1-0 victory in Basel, Switzerland. Former USMNT midfielder Michael Bradley scored the go-ahead goal in the 86th minute.

 More than half of the matches between these nations have been played in Switzerland, most recently in 2021 and 2015 before that. Matches played in U.S. cities included Tampa, Fla. (1985), Miami, Fla. (1991) and Fullerton, Calif. (1994). The most memorable of these meetings for the USMNT occurred in Pontiac, Mich. when former USMNT forward Eric Wynalda scored the iconic free kick from 28 yards in the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Switzerland hasn't faced the USMNT on American soil since 1994, when the USA hosted the World Cup for the first time.

 Historically, the USA has scored seven goals against Switzerland while allowing 11.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Union's Nathan Harriel is enjoying the spoils of being a utility man for club and now for country with the USMNT","https://www.inquirer.com/soccer/union-nathan-harriel-soccer-usmnt-concacaf-gold-cup-20250610.html","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Harriel's ability to be a man of many positions earned him his senior debut for the national team. Next up? Win the Gold Cup.

From the outside looking in, Nathan Harriel is continually in the right place at the right time, despite his unassuming presence. 

Harriel rebounded from an early-season injury and returned to the pitch in late March. He rewarded the Union with the game-tying goal in an comeback road win on the over Toronto FC on May 28.

From the inside looking out, everyone who works with Harriel, from coaches to teammates, attests to a work ethic that made it little surprise when his name ended up on the U.S. men's national team roster for summer training camp.

It was a bit surprising, however, to see that the native Floridian made the 26-man roster for the United States' upcoming run in the Concacaf Gold Cup, which begins Sunday. 

For Harriel, the opinions from both sides are appreciated, but they don't define the 24-year-old and what he has accomplished for his club — and now for his country. 

“It's always an honor to be on that list for the U.S. national team,” Harriel said shortly before leaving to join the team's camp last week in Chicago. “It doesn't matter if it's for the [Concacaf] Nations League or the Gold Cup, anything to do with the U.S., it's always an honor to be a part of.”

Harriel's intangibles are not quite what you'd expect from the typical defensive-minded player. For starters, he's unafraid to break out of the Union's third and attack opposing defenders, using his speed to zoom past.

» READ MORE: The Union's big influence on the USMNT is a remarkable feat: ‘To be together here is special'

He won't necessarily outsmart foes with impressive moves; he instead relies on every inch of a 5-foot-10, 150-pound frame to keep defenders at bay and pose a consistent threat in the final third. 

Early this season, Harriel missed multiple weeks with a nagging thigh injury. Still, with two goals this year, he's already matched his total from last season. His first goal came May 14 vs. the L.A. Galaxy, and the second was a well-timed header off a Union restart that Toronto goalkeeper Sean Johnson had no chance of snagging. 

It showcased another one of his skills. 

“He's excellent in the air,” said Union manager Bradley Carnell. “But really, he can do it all: He can supply, he can get crosses off, he can shoot, he can dribble. So, really, he has a good range and awareness of when to do what [he has to do to create opportunities], and that's what brought him into this window of selection for the Gold Cup.”

Harriel's versatility for the Union undoubtedly is what got him noticed by U.S. boss Mauricio Pochettino. The call-up is Harriel's first at the senior level, but he had cracked the roster of U.S. youth national teams. 

Harriel admitted that his game is always a work in progress, but it's gotten him looks from Pochettino just one year out from the World Cup, a tournament with a great deal of uncertainty for American fans — and even for some players. 

» READ MORE: USMNT's Mauricio Pochettino gives ‘guarantee that we are going to compete' at Gold Cup

Harriel's thigh injury “was really unfortunate timing,” Carnell said. “We know what type of player he is and the qualities he has. He's a right back, but sometimes he's a left back, sometimes he's a little higher. We've had him in multiple positions, but that's because of the qualities he possesses as a player.” 

In the first of two friendlies for the U.S. team ahead of the Gold Cup, Harriel entered the match in the 65th minute as an attacking midfielder with the U.S. looking to snatch a goal back in an eventual 2-1 loss to Turkey. 

“I'll play wherever I'm asked to go in and make a difference,” Harriel said. “Like I said before, playing for your country is an honor that not many players will get to do. My job is to go in and try to impact the game, try to do the things that put the team in the best position to win.”

The U.S. might need to rely on those qualities in a friendly against Switzerland on Tuesday (8 p.m., TNT) before the start of group play in the Gold Cup against Trinidad and Tobago on Sunday (6 p.m., Fox29).

“This is very physically demanding, but I think that's what suits the U.S. the best: The physical abilities we have as a country,” Harriel said. “I'd like to think I possess a lot of those attributes, and I'm looking to be on the front foot and see where it takes me ... it's pressure I'm ready for.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Is Mauricio Pochettino's style too slow for the USMNT?","https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45479897/mauricio-pochettino-slow-usmnt-analysis-gold-cup-world-cup","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 12:14:00 GMT","

Jeff Carlisle and Ryan O'Hanlon look ahead to the Gold Cup for the USMNT. (1:49)

If anything will stick from the USMNT's mostly unmemorable 2-1 loss to Turkey last week, it'll be either Jack McGlynn's first goal with the team, or the unfortunate moment when Johnny Cardoso flicked the ball into Arda Güler's shin and into his team's own goal.

But the most illustrative moment from the exhibition match happened a few seconds before the ball was trickling past goalkeeper Matt Freese and across the goal line.

Alex Freeman had just won the ball from Juventus' Kenan Yildiz right outside the USMNT's penalty area. He shifted the ball over to Cardoso, who had the opportunity to play a quick, long, forward pass into tons of space on the left side of the field. Turkey had just lost possession, so it hadn't yet shifted into its defensive shape. Instead, Cardoso hesitated and then played a safe pass to Chris Richards. As this happened, U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino threw his hands into the air, jumped up, spun around and yelled something toward the bench. A couple of seconds later, Freese was scooping the ball out of his net.

While the goal itself was a freak play -- somewhat bad luck that the ball was deflected in the first place, entirely bad luck that it deflected in such a way to then spin into the side netting -- the entire possession was a microcosm of the team's biggest problem under Pochettino: It plays too slow. While most of the modern USMNT era has been characterized by constant, hectic overactivity, the past couple of months have flipped back too far in the other direction.

Pochettino knows this; he addressed the play postmatch, reacting in the moment, and he made similar comments after the 1-0 loss to Panama in the Nations League semifinals. But if the team is going to make a run at the World Cup next summer, he's going to have to find a way to get his players to, well, run.

Pochettino has managed only nine U.S. games so far, and the general rule in the club soccer world is that we should wait 10 games before drawing any conclusions. But only three of those games were competitive, while a fourth, the third-place Nations League match, was what we'll call ""partially competitive."" Throw in the fact that the rosters and lineups have been significantly different across almost every international break, and it's still way too early to say anything remotely definitive.

The biggest difference between Pochettino's tenure and the Gregg Berhalter era that preceded it, though, seems to be the structure in possession. The latter had somewhat rigid positional guidelines for where everyone should be, while the former has given the players license to solve defensive problems on their own.

""The way we press [under Pochettino] is a lot more aggressive, especially from goal kicks,"" midfielder Luca de la Torre told ESPN after the Turkey match. ""There's the intention to play in the half of the other team. And there's probably more freedom with Pochettino in terms of the positioning of the players to find the solutions in open play.""

Midfielder Malik Tillman echoed De la Torre's final point. ""He gives us offensive players a lot of freedom to move around the pitch to find the right spaces,"" the PSV attacker said. ""With Gregg, there was a lot more focus on being in the same spaces.""

Again, it's still way too early to say which approach is more effective, or if one is even more effective than the other. And while strict positional guidelines provide built-in fundamentals that the team can play within right away, the more relational style should theoretically take more time to develop since the players need to understand each other's inherent tendencies. The free-flowing approach could improve with time -- or it could be impossible to establish due to the ever-changing personnel and limited game time on offer in the international game.

Perhaps, too, this is why the team has struggled to move the ball at speed so far under Pochettino. It's hard to make decisions when you're not sure where your teammates are going to be.

Stats Perform has full data for USMNT matches going back to 2010. And among the managers who have been in charge for at least five games, Pochettino's team ranks last for:

- The speed it moves the ball upfield: 1.03 meters per second
- The number of possessions it has per match: 82.1

The former is pretty straightforward -- literally, how quickly do you move the ball toward the opposition goal? The latter represents, roughly, how much chaos you want your matches to have. For example: Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool played high possession games where the ball was constantly changing hands, while Pep Guardiola's Manchester City rank last in the Premier League for possessions per game almost every season. For comparison: Berhalter's teams moved at 1.34 meters per second and averaged 87.8 possessions per game.

This isn't to say that the slower approach can't work; clearly, it can. Pep's City won everything while playing slower than everyone else, while Mikel Arteta's Arsenal play very slowly, and they've finished second in the Premier League for three consecutive seasons. In general, European soccer has become more methodical and less hectic with each passing season.

At the same time, the three best teams in the world right now -- PSG, Liverpool and Barcelona -- all tend to play faster and embrace more chaos than is popular at the highest levels of the game. And most of the USMNT's best players are better off playing that way, too.

Dan Thomas and Steve Nicol clash over Maurico Pochettino's reign so far as USMNT coach.

When it works, the slower approach keeps the ball away from your opponents, prevents the kind of odd-number counterattacks that Hansi Flick's Barcelona frequently face, and creates a low volume of high-quality chances.

Defensively, the team has been totally fine under Pochettino. The loss against Panama had nothing to do with a dysfunctional defense. The USMNT conceded three total shots for 0.1 expected goals -- if you could guarantee that the Americans would do that at every game at the World Cup next summer, then I'd tell you to go and bet on them to win the tournament right now.

No, the problem against Panama -- and more broadly -- was that the USMNT created a low volume of low-quality chances. If you're not going to take more risks and attempt more shots, then you have to be able to generate better shots with the few shots you do take. In Pochettino's nine matches, though, the U.S. has attempted 10.4 shots per game -- fewer than in any managerial tenure other than Dave Sarachan's lame-duck interim stint between Jurgen Klinsmann and Gregg Berhalter. But they've also generated only five total shots worth at least a third of an expected goal. For comparison, Berhalter's teams averaged 1.6 per game.

These are all of the 94 shots attempted under Pochettino, sized by the expected-goal value of the attempt:

Ultimately, the slower approach just doesn't really seem to fit many of the USMNT's best players. In attack, Folarin Balogun had his breakout season while playing in a transition-heavy approach under Will Still at Reims. Both Christian Pulisic and Timothy Weah are at their best when they're able to run at unsettled defenses. And at PSV, both Ricardo Pepi and Malik Tillman have been successful for Peter Bosz and his wide-open tactics.

In midfield, all of Tyler Adams' best seasons have come for the embracers of chaos at Bournemouth, Leeds and RB Leipzig. Weston McKennie continues to flourish despite the relatively conservative tactics at Juventus, but I think a lot of that is because his managers all realize they need to find a way to embrace the risks he takes off the ball. And at this point in his career, Yunus Musah's most valuable skill is his ability to break through pressure and create transition moments for his team.

Even at the back, Antonee Robinson is one of the most athletic fullbacks in the open field ... in the entire world. Chris Richards plays for a former Red Bull manager in Oliver Glasner at Crystal Palace. Sergiño Dest is probably the only first-choice player who seems totally comfortable in this possession-dominant, patient approach -- and he's still yet to play a game for Pochettino.

With the 2024-25 season officially over, it's time to rank the top 100 players in the world of men's soccer right now. Welcome to the FC 100. Read the full list here.

Now, there is a potential cheat code -- set pieces -- here. Without them, Arsenal would be a top-four challenger and a Champions League also-ran rather than a title challenger and a European semifinalist. If you can methodically create chances from set pieces, then you can afford to play a low-risk, slower style. Plus, if you score the opening goal from a set piece, then the defense has to soften up, and that makes it easier to attack.

Although the U.S. hired famed set piece coach Gianni Vio, we still haven't seen any of this yet. For all the possession the USMNT has had under Pochettino -- 60.4%, more than under any other manager -- it has attempted just 1.6 set piece shots per game, the fewest under any manager.

So, through the first nine games of the Pochettino era, we seem to have a coach who says he wants his team to play faster and a group of players who thrive at a higher tempo. Yet, somehow, they've struggled to ever get out of first gear. Perhaps Poch's public frustrations don't match with what he's telling his team to do. Maybe these players need stricter positional guidelines. Or it could just be some early-tenure growing pains.

The broader challenge for this summer, with the limited roster at the Gold Cup, and next summer at the World Cup, is for the USMNT to find a way to start consistently generating higher-quality chances on goal. And barring some development on the set piece front, the way to get there is to find an answer to what seems like a simple question: How do you get all of your runners to start running again?","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Al Hilal's deal to sign N'Golo Kante on a short-term deal could collapse due to fan backlash, talkSPORT understands.

Kante is on the books for Saudi Pro League rivals Al Ittihad.

However, Al Hilal are the only Saudi side to qualify for the Club World Cup and are keen to take Kante with them.

Kante has agreed to a deal and it is now down to the clubs to finalise negotiations.

But it remains to be seen whether they will pay attention to what promises to be a furious reaction from fans in Saudi Arabia over a deal constructed between two rivals.

The expectation, should a deal be completed, is that Kante will return to Al Ittihad for the 2025/26 season.

Al-Hilal and Al Ittihad are both controlled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, while central Saudi dealmakers also see value in Kante switching clubs believing he will raise Hilal's profile during the Club World Cup.

Al Hilal begin their tournament against Real Madrid in Miami on June 18 and have been keen to add marquee names ahead of that fixture, which will also see former Inter boss Simone Inzaghi make his debut.

Al Hilal retained the central budget originally allocated for Mohamed Salah's wages had he left Liverpool, giving them over £500m to spend this summer. They are expected to be ambitious after the Club World Cup in the market as well.

The Riyadh-based club tried for Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes and Napoli striker Victor Osimhen and talkSPORT understands they even made a late call on Monday about Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.

Atlanta's Ederson, Inter's Nicola Barella and Aston Villa's Youri Tielemans were all also approached, while deals for Roma's Angelino and Milan's Theo Hernandez fell through. 

Hilal may revisit some of their these targets after the Club World Cup.

A loan move, similar to what is being proposed for N'Golo Kante, was also proposed for Cristiano Ronaldo.

However, the Portugal star was reticent to switch from Al Nassr to Al Hilal, given the city rivalry between the clubs. Ronaldo is now expected to extend at Al Nassr.

Kante is more open to a temporary switch. The 34-year-old has made 81 appearances for Al Ittiahd since leaving Chelsea in summer 2023, and won the Saudi Pro League title last season.

Should an agreement be reached on Tuesday, Kante will join Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ruben Neves and be reunited with his former Chelsea teammate Kalidou Koulibaly.

Ian Wright was around 27/28 when he joined Arsenal and went on to score 128 league goals in the top flight for them, on top of the 28 league goals he'd already got in the First Division for Palace. Viktor Gyokeres might also be a ""late bloomer"" so his age is pretty irrelevant at this stage.

Shaun

With just 30 minutes to go before today's transfer deadline, here is a reminder of the main stories and completed deals we have had so far:

With Rayan Ait-Nouri already through the door and Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki expected to follow imminently [just over 30 minutes to complete] - Manchester City could be fielding a new-look XI when they take on Wydad AC at the Club World Cup on 18 June. 

Should Reijnders and Cherki get done in time for the competition getting under way - this could be the starting side that Pep Guardiola fields next week.

What people are not realising about certain transfers not happening before this deadline ends is PSR. For example, Man united will look to sign Mbuemo in the next transfer window as it will effectively knock on PSR incomes/losses to the following year. Hence why most of us know Mbeumo is going to United but none of that deal will officially happen until the next deadline as it makes sound business sense to wait. The trouble a club like United have in waiting is that it gives other clubs a chance to hijack a deal. This is why I worry about us getting a no.9 in....there are not many no.9's out there to be so bold and wait!

Sam

Arsenal have long been admirers of Benjamin Sesko, but interest from Saudi Arabia may drive up RB Leipzig's asking price for the striker.

Leipzig reportedly wanted 80m euros (£68m), but according to the Telegraph, external, interest from two Saudi Arabian clubs could increase that.

They say the Slovenian's current preference is to remain in Europe, and that he is keen to join the Gunners.

Craig NelsonBBC Sport reporter

One thing you can say about Viktor Gyokeres is that he can do it on a rainy night in Stoke. 

During his stint in the Championship with Coventry, the Sporting striker - who has been linked with a move to Manchester United - has scored three goals against Stoke in five games. 

The Swedish frontman helped Coventry to three wins and one draw in those five games, with just one defeat on his record.  

WhatsApp on 03301231826, text 81111 (UK only, standard rates apply)

Gyokeres hasn't played in a top 5 league so it's quite difficult for him to have scored a goal in one!

Conor

Re Paul 17:56 - he has scored 50 goals this season and has scored 7 goals in the Champions League. 50 goals in any league cannot be ignored. He is also considerably cheaper than Ekitike, Sesko and Osimhen. At just £60m for a goalscoring machine, that's great value!

Paul

As well as Tijjani Reijnders, Manchester City are hoping to complete the signing of Lyon midfielder Rayan Cherki before tonight's transfer deadline in less than an hour.

City and Lyon have reportedly agreed upon a £30.5m fee, plus add-ons worth about £4.2m.

Yesterday, Fabrizio Romano reported that Cherki would travel to Manchester today, external to sign his contract and undergo a medical.

Will City get it done in time?

Craig NelsonBBC Sport reporter

For anyone who follows cycling, I am imagining this final 60 minutes of the first transfer window of the summer to be similar to a summit finish in the Tour de France. 

One by one, riders [clubs] have fallen away, happy to save themselves for another day [the summer's second, proper transfer window].

But two are left racing for the line. 

Both Chelsea and Manchester City know that, if they want to register a new player in time to join their squad for the upcoming Club World Cup, this is the time. 

They must submit those squads by the end of today.



We should find out in the next hour...

WhatsApp on 03301231826, text 81111 (UK only, standard rates apply)

Gyokeres has scored precisely zero goals in a top five league - he is 27! Massively overvalued!

Paul

Real Madrid

One transfer that has got over the line during this window is Spain defender Dean Huijsen's switch from Bournemouth to Real Madrid for £50million. 

The 20-year-old described Madrid as ""the club of my life"" as he was formally
unveiled today.

He signed his contract at the club's training ground, alongside president Florentino Perez.

Huijsen, who was born in the
Netherlands but moved to Spain aged five, has earned four senior caps for the Spanish national team following a breakout season.

The defender played 36 times last season for the Cherries, establishing himself in the Premier League and helping Bournemouth finish ninth.

His move to the Spanish capital came after Madrid triggered the release clause in his Bournemouth deal.

""I've wanted to be here since day one,"" Huijsen said. ""Since Madrid called, I've had no other
team in mind."" 

""I'm coming to the best club in the world and I'm here to give it my all with
humility, and hopefully we can win many trophies together. Madrid is the club of my life."" 

It's been almost a week since Manchester City agreed a 55m euros (£46.3m) deal with AC Milan for Netherlands midfielder Tijjani Reijnders - so why hasn't he joined yet?

According to multiple reports - including Fabrizio , externalRomano - Reijnders completed a medical with City over the weekend, and has now agreed personal terms.

His transfer should be officially completed tonight, barring unforeseen complications.

Craig NelsonBBC Sport reporter

Just a reminder that Chelsea would have had to submit a deal sheet for Jamie Gittens by 17:00 BST, ahead of the 19:00 transfer deadline. 

There is no sense that an agreement has been reached, but how many transfer sagas have run on past a midnight deadline in the past?

This transfer saga may be over - for now - but let's not rule anything out just yet. 

WhatsApp on 03301231826 or text 81111 (UK only, standard rates apply)

John: Re Mike 17:15, Mbuemo has turned town Arsenal and Newcastle and wants to play for Man Utd. He is not going to suddenly change his mind for Spurs now!

The fact that both Chelsea and Borussia Dortmund are this week set to fly out to the United States to compete at the extended Club World Cup has added an extra layer of intrigue to the Blues' pursuit of Jamie Gittens. 

It seems both clubs want the England winger in their squad for the Fifa tournament. 

Gittens, 20, is a Borussia Dortmund player, as it stands, after the Bundesliga side rejected an offer of 50m euros (£42.2m). 

But if Chelsea up their bid before today's 7pm transfer deadline then that could change. 

One thing to note is that the two clubs could meet in the Club World Cup semi-finals. 

If that happens, will Gittens be wearing blue or yellow?  

With 90 minutes to go before today's transfer deadline, let's recap the main stories and completed deals we have had so far:

Amy CanavanBBC Sport Scotland

Bringing Kieran Tierney back to the club is “probably the best move Celtic have made”, says former captain Scott Brown. 

Brown was Tierney's team-mate when he broke through at the Scottish champions and believes the deal is a “really good fit” for both parties. 

“Longer term, Kieran will be Celtic captain,” Brown told BBC Sport Scotland. 

“He's a very, very good character in and about the place. Everyone loves him because he gives 110% and you can see how good he's got going down the road, working with better players.

“He's nowhere near coming to the end of his career. He'll probably say, 'can I go and win trophies and show that I'm a top quality player?' and go again.”

Kevin de Bruyne finally looks set to sign a contract with Napoli, which will take effect when his contract at Manchester City expires later this month.

According to journalists Matteo Moretto, external and Fabrizio Romano, external, De Bruyne, 33, and Napoli have agreed upon a two-year contract with the option of an additional year.

All that remains is for the Belgian midfielder to sign the contract and complete a medical this week.

A lot of people are dismissing the new Club World Cup, but it could prove to be a very important tournament for Chelsea and their players.

It is thought that Chelsea could earn up to £97m in prize money if they go on to win the whole thing.

That explains why the club are taking the competition so seriously. They have already signed Liam Delap from Ipswich Town to give them a boost heading into their opening game against Los Angeles FC.

Delap, who was at Cobham on Monday despite not needing to report in until Tuesday, will be hoping to start that match. And so will Djordje Petrovic.

At one stage, it looked like AC Milan star Mike Maignan would be starting in goal for Chelsea at the Club World Cup.

Chelsea were working on signing Maignan but eventually decided to exit talks with Milan after failing to reach an agreement with them over a transfer fee.

No expectation currently that Chelsea will sign Mike Maignan today. Club sticking to their valuation and there's a big gap between that and what AC Milan want. As we stand it is not expected to happen in time for today's 7pm deadline #cfc

Chelsea fans will be disappointed, as Maignan is rated as one of Europe's top keepers. However, it is good news for Petrovic.

After a fantastic season at Strasbourg, Petrovic may fancy his chances when competing against Robert Sanchez and Filip Jorgensen. Against Maignan, France's No.1, perhaps not so much.

Ultimately, with Maignan not in the picture, Petrovic could get an opportunity to start at the Club World Cup. And if Petrovic takes it, Chelsea may decide to keep hold of the 25-year-old this summer rather than sell him.

In April, it was claimed that either Petrovic or Sanchez will be sold, with Chelsea wanting to keep hold of Jorgensen and Mike Penders

Jorgensen only arrived at the club last summer, while Penders has a big future at 19. Petrovic and Sanchez have been at Stamford Bridge longer, joining in 2023 when Mauricio Pochettino was in the dugout.

They have had their opportunities, but after Chelsea's failure to get a deal for Maignan over the line, the pair could get more at the Club World Cup.","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

Summer Transfer

Window

Borussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens is not expected to move to Chelsea before the Club World Cup, while the London club have ended their interest in signing AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan this summer.

The Athletic reported on Saturday that Chelsea had submitted an official proposal to sign Gittens, having agreed a seven-year contract with the player. The Premier League side were keen to strike a deal that would allow the 20-year-old to feature for them in the upcoming tournament in the United States.

But ahead of Tuesday's registration deadline (7pm BST, 2pm ET), a move is not expected to materialise with no club-to-club agreement reached and Chelsea so far unwilling to meet Dortmund's asking price. Chelsea remain relaxed on the situation with the summer transfer window opening again on June 16 and not closing until September 1.

Should an agreement be found mid-tournament, Chelsea could register Gittens for the knockout stages, provided they get there and that Gittens hadn't featured in the competition previously.

Chelsea had considered a move for Maignan and, as The Athletic reported, the 30-year-old France international has told his agent he wants to leave the Serie A club.

But Chelsea did not want to overpay for the goalkeeper, who has 12 months left on his contract and will be able to negotiate a free transfer with foreign clubs from January onwards.

Chelsea never made an official bid for Maignan but told Milan that they were willing to spend a maximum of €15m. The London club saw the €20m sale of Christian Pulisic to Milan in 2023 as part of their reasoning. The United States international also had a year remaining on his contract, but was six years younger and plays in a position which commands higher fees. However, Milan valued their goalkeeper at a higher fee and so Chelsea have decided to walk away.

Chelsea are happy with the quartet of keepers they have to choose from at the FIFA Club World Cup in Robert Sanchez, Filip Jorgensen, Djordje Petrovic (who is returning from loan at Strasbourg) and Mike Penders, the Genk 19-year-old a deal was agreed for in advance last summer. Head coach Enzo Maresca did not ask Chelsea to sign Maignan and the quartet will battle it out in America to be first choice.

Chelsea are, though, expecting to sell one of Sanchez or Petrovic during the window, with another of the goalkeepers earmarked to join Strasbourg on loan. Back-up Marcus Bettinelli is set to join Manchester City for an undisclosed fee.

The Athletic previously reported that Chelsea were looking to sign a striker and a right-footed winger this summer, with Gittens emerging as a priority target after recording 12 goals and five assists in 48 matches for Dortmund during the 2024-25 campaign.

Liam Delap was signed from Ipswich Town in a £30m deal last week and will play at the Club World Cup with Andrey Santos, who is returning from a season-long loan at Strasbourg, and new signings Dario Essugo, Kendry Paez and Mamadou Sarr joining the squad in the U.S. after previously agreeing moves.

Chelsea kick off their campaign in the newly-expanded tournament against Los Angeles FC on June 16 before games with Flamengo (June 20) and ES Tunis (June 24).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Tuchel: Liverpool, Arsenal PL favourites due to CWC","https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45484204/club-world-cup-gives-liverpool-arsenal-premier-league-edge-tuchel","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 11:39:00 GMT","

Thomas Tuchel explains his criticisms of England's performance in their 1-0 World Cup qualifying win over Andorra. (0:59)

England boss Thomas Tuchel has said Liverpool and Arsenal will have a ""huge advantage"" in next season's Premier League title race due to them not being involved in the Club World Cup.

Chelsea and Manchester City will represent the Premier League in the expanded 32-team tournament -- which starts on June 14 -- and both teams will play a minimum three games. If either side reaches the final, they could play seven matches in a month.

Meanwhile, Liverpool and Arsenal, the top two from the 2024-25 league campaign, can rest before their first preseason friendlies in July.

Tuchel believes that could make a marked difference.

""I think it [the Club World Cup] will have a huge impact and it will give Liverpool and Arsenal a huge advantage in the next season to not be there,"" the former Chelsea manager said.

""After a long season, they feel the tiredness. Harry [Kane] said he felt like coming [to England's training camp] after one week would have been much harder.

""It was easier to come after two weeks. It gave him a kind of refreshment, and there were many players who came back after one week, and they said 'Ah, we were just getting into holiday mode, and now we put the boots back on.'""

Tuchel also believes the fatigue from the Club World Cup -- along with gruelling schedules next year -- could have consequences for him on the international stage.

""I think it will be a very nice experience for the players who are there to play this tournament for the first time so it is mixed feelings about it,"" he added.

Brazil can punch their tickets to the 2026 FIFA World Cup when they take on Paraguay at Neo Química Arena.

The Seleção got its CONMEBOL 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers off to a poor start under former manager Dorival Junior. Brazil secured just three victories in their first eight qualifying matches and looked in deep trouble of potentially missing out on the biggest tournament in the sport.

The team eventually started producing results, though, and now find themselves fourth in the CONMBEOL standings. Under new boss Carlo Ancelotti, Brazil are hoping to solidify their place in the United States, Canada and Mexico next summer as soon as possible. 

Let's take a look at just what results need to occur on June 10 for Brazil to qualify for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Brazil must defeat Paraguay in São Paulo if they want to have a chance of qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup on June 10. If the Seleção collects all three points against La Albirroja, then the team still needs one of the following to occur:

The easiest pathway to qualification for Brazil would be if Uruguay defeat Venezuela. La Celeste would normally be the favorites to walk away with a victory, but the team is coming off a poor 2–0 loss to Paraguay. Brazil will hope Uruguay can bounce back and secure three points to help the Seleção get one step closer to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

If Uruguay only manage a draw, then Brazil also need Argentina to defeat Colombia. The two CONMEBOL powerhouses have traded blows over the last year, but Lionel Messi and co. should still have the edge over Colombia on Tuesday night.

The good news for Ancelotti's men is that they kick off after both the aforementioned games. Check out the CONMEBOL match schedule:

Barring any delays, Brazil will have a good idea of Uruguay's result before they kick off. Should Venezuela come out with a victory, then Brazil cannot qualify for the 2026 FIFA World Cup on June 10 regardless of their result against Paraguay.

SEATTLE — FIFA World Cup 2026 play may be one year out, but security plans for the major soccer event have been in the works for nearly two years.

The goal is to make sure fans and players are safe while enjoying the thrill of matches played in host cities like Seattle.

Former Seattle Police Chief John Diaz is the chief security officer for Seattle FIFA World Cup 2026 operations.

Diaz said fans can expect to see a number of law enforcement officers and safety personnel, including police patrols, private security, World Cup ambassadors, and volunteers, in and around Lumen Field.

Once fans are inside Lumen Field in Seattle for matches, the stadium's gameday policies remain in place.

Working with federal agencies like Homeland Security for years now, the FIFA World Cup's 16 host cities are primed to kick off their respective matches.

Diaz told KING 5 the key to securing this magnitude of a sports event is collaboration.

""Here in this state, it's going to require all the resources that we bring in - mutual aid and others from both the police and our fire, our state local and our federal resources,"" Diaz said.

FIFA World Cup 2026 will be the largest in the international event's history.

The federation not only established three host countries and 16 host cities - it has bumped up the number of teams that will play from 32 to 48.

The first of six Seattle-based matches is set for June 15, 2026.

By then - the Seattle security team will have logged about three years of planning efforts.

""I think right now we have 27 work groups here in the state that have different pieces of the plan, and so we're looking at everything,"" Diaz said. ""The transportation side of it to the intelligence side to the training and exercise piece of it.""

An estimated 750,000 people are expected to descend upon the Emerald City and surrounding areas for FIFA World Cup 2026.

Keeping that many people safe is a challenge and poses several potential risks.

The federal government uses the Special Event Assessment Rating (SEAR) to assess the risk level. The rating decides the level of federal support.

The World Cup is rated SEAR 2. 

By comparison - the Super Bowl is SEAR 1. Diaz said a SEAR 2 rating is ""still extremely high"" and those ratings can change and be elevated.

Security plans for FIFA World Cup 2026 will apply to the nine designated Fan Zones across Washington state.These zones were created to ""ensure that as many Washingtonians as possible can be part of this historic event."" FIFA said Specific locations within each city will be announced ahead of the tournament.

Washington State FIFAWC26 Fan Zones:

What can you do to make World Cup match days fun and safe?

-Arrive early and don't linger outside Lumen Field. Exterior areas need to be secured as well.

-Follow the clear bag stadium policy. This policy is likely new for international visitors.

-Fireworks and any type of pyrotechnics are prohibited.","{'href': 'https://www.king5.com', 'title': 'KING5.com'}","soccer"

Already qualified Japan beat Indonesia 6-0 in the final Group C game in the AFC qualifiers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Daichi Kamada scored twice as Japan rounded off their successful World Cup qualifying campaign with a 6-0 thrashing of Patrick Kluivert's Indonesia in Osaka.

Kamada, an FA Cup winner with Crystal Palace in England this season, struck twice in Tuesday's first half as already-qualified Japan finished their campaign as Group C winners, scoring 30 goals in their 10 matches.

Takefusa Kubo, Ryoya Morishita, Shuto Machino and substitute Mao Hosoya were also on target against Indonesia, who finished fourth in the group.

Kluivert's side, who were backed by a large number of supporters who had travelled to Japan, advanced to a further round with five other teams to decide two more Asian qualifiers for next year's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The result matched Japan's previous winning margin against Indonesia, which also came in a 6-0 win in 1976.

Japan coach Hajime Moriyasu has set the ambitious target of winning the World Cup in North America.

His side will play friendlies against teams from outside Asia over the next 12 months, and Kamada is looking to learn from the experience.

“Playing against Asian teams and against the kind of European teams who will be at the World Cup is totally different,” said the 28-year-old.

“As we play these games, we will start to see a lot of areas where we need to improve. We need to come together as a team and overcome these problems when they crop up.”

Japan have already lined up away friendlies against Mexico and the US in September and will face four as yet unnamed opponents at home before the end of the year.

Moriyasu said his players need to keep improving “in all departments” and praised their attitude against Indonesia.

“The challenge for the players is to break past their limits and grow,” he said.

“They did that in training and in the game, where they were never satisfied and always looking for the next goal and the next chance, which is great to see.”

Japan lost their unbeaten qualifying record in a 1-0 defeat away to Australia last week, with coach Hajime Moriyasu fielding an experimental lineup with qualification already in the bag.

He started with two more debutants against Indonesia, handing first caps to defender Junnosuke Suzuki and winger Shunsuke Mito.

Kamada opened the scoring in the 15th minute, heading home from a Mito cross.

The Palace forward turned provider for his team's second, combining with Kubo before the Real Sociedad man fired past Indonesia goalkeeper Emil Audero.

Indonesia lost defender Kevin Diks to injury midway through the first half, and his replacement, Yakob Sayuri, lasted only 15 minutes before he also had to go off after a clash of heads.

Kamada scored Japan's third on the stroke of half-time, waltzing through the Indonesia defence before tucking the ball over Audero.

Morishita volleyed home at the back post in the 55th minute for his first international goal.

Machino and Hosoya also got on the scoresheet as Japan continued to squeeze Indonesia until the final whistle.

Topic:Socceroos

Saudi Arabia will hope to create an intense atmosphere in Jeddah. (Getty Images: Yasser Bakhsh)

The Socceroos are so close they can almost taste it. 

Automatic qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup is just 90 minutes away following the Socceroos' dramatic 1-0 victory over Japan in Perth. 

Follow live coverage of the Socceroos' World Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia online with our live blog, and commentary on ABC Sport Digital Radio or via the ABC Listen App.

However, the Socceroos first face the task of Saudi Arabia on Wednesday morning before they can book their spot on the plane. 

Saudi Arabia is still in with a chance of upsetting Australia's hopes and stealing the final automatic qualification spot. 

Here's what needs to happen for Australia to progress to their sixth-straight World Cup finals.

Simply put, a draw or a victory over Saudi Arabia in Jeddah will confirm the Socceroos' spot on the plane to North America.

The Green Eagles, in third spot, are three competition points behind second-placed Australia in Group C of this phase of qualifying.

With two teams from each of the three six-team groups progressing to North America next year, the Socceroos only have to equal Saudi Arabia to join group winners Japan at the showpiece 48-team tournament.

The Socceroos can still progress even if Saudi Arabia wins.

Due to the Socceroos' far superior goal difference, Saudi Arabia will need to win by a whopping five clear goals to leap-frog Australia to second spot.

Saudi Arabia has not beaten a team by this margin since they beat Palestine 5-0 in March 2021 and have not scored more than that since a 7-2 victory over Cambodia in January 2017.

Saudi Arabia has scored just six goals in this phase of qualifying, with only Bahrain (5) scoring fewer across all the teams in Asia in this phase of qualifying.

The Socceroos will hope everything goes smoothly in Jeddah. (Getty Images: Matt King)

Things get mighty complicated if Australia can't hang on to second spot in the group.

Nobody will confuse the Socceroos' victory over Japan as anything other than the most desperate of smash-and-grab victories. But in the end, does that even matter?

The Socceroos cannot finish any lower than third or fourth, which will put them in the fourth phase of qualifying.

That means the Socceroos would be placed into a round-robin tournament in October, played at a centralised venue within the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and featuring the other third- and fourth-placed teams from across the AFC in two groups of three.

That is likely to be the UAE and Qatar from Group A; and Oman, Iraq or Palestine from Group B — although those groups are still in flux.

The two group winners from each three-team group will progress to the 2026 World Cup.

If the Socceroos finish second in that group, there is still another chance to qualify through the intercontinental play-offs, but first they'd have to beat the other second-placed finisher from the other group in another two-legged match.

Then they'd need to finish in the top two of a six-team inter-confederation play-off tournament in the USA.

The Saudis were furious after having a late goal chalked off for offside. (Getty Images: Graham Denholm)

Last time around the Socceroos drew 0-0 with Saudi Arabia in Melbourne all the way back in November.

Incredibly, the Saudis had a last-gasp winner (correctly) ruled out for a narrow offside decision.

Saudi Arabia vs the Socceroos kicks off at 4:15am (AEST) on Wednesday morning in New South Wales, Queensland, the ACT, Victoria and Tasmania.

That's 2:15am in Western Australia and 3:45am in South Australia and the Northern Territory.

Chelsea are beginning to lose confidence in their chance to sign Mike Maignan from AC Milan as they can't agree on the transfer fee. The Blues remain hopeful that they can finally agree on a deal with the Rossoneri, but time is ticking.

The Blues are keen on snatching Maignan as their main keeper for the new season, but they want him available already for the FIFA Club World Cup. However, the early transfer window for teams participating in the tournament will end on June 10, so they must speed things up.

Chelsea believes that Maignan's profile suits what Enzo Maresca is looking for, so they are keen on getting him this summer. Knowing that the French keeper has one year left in his contract and hasn't reached an agreement with Milan for an extension, the Blues aim to pounce.

Maresca's side were confident that they could get a discount price because of Maignan's contract situation, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Milan have reportedly been asking for 25 million euros for the French goalie, while Chelsea initially insisted on only paying 10 million euros.

The latest reports suggest that both teams are still negotiating, but the Athletic's Simon Johnson reported that the Blues' confidence is not that high. There's still time before the special transfer window for the FIFA Club World Cup participants closes, but things are not looking good for Chelsea.

Milan refuses to budge from their initial request, believing that Maignan's value is higher than what the Blues are proposing. It remains to be seen whether the Rossoneri and Chelsea will meet halfway, as the Blues do have the keeper's approval over a transfer.

Nevertheless, the Rossoneri initially still keen on keeping Maignan, so if there's no deal agreed with Chelsea, Massimiliano Allegri's side might try to reach an agreement with the keeper once again. Moreover, Milan might also believe that there will be other suitors who would be open to pay the price they requested for the French international goalie in this summer transfer window.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Novak Djokovic was told 'no' by tearful wife after announcing he was quitting tennis","https://www.themirror.com/sport/tennis/novak-djokovic-retirement-french-open-1199065","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 11:14:00 GMT","

Novak Djokovic once came shockingly close to ending his illustrious tennis career before bouncing back to clinch an additional 12 Grand Slam titles.

The 38-year-old, who had only secured half of his major trophies by 2018, became disenchanted with tennis following a string of injuries and parted ways with his then-coach, Andre Agassi.

Djokovic's turning point was a series of unexpected losses, starting with a fourth-round defeat by Hyeon Chung at the Australian Open. This defeat led him to undergo elbow surgery for a persistent injury from the previous year.

His comeback was marred by further disappointments, including a loss to qualifier Taro Daniel at Indian Wells and a second-round exit at the hands of Benoit Paire in Miami.

These setbacks drove Djokovic to gather his team and his wife, Jelena Djokovic, to announce his intention to retire from tennis. He later shared this pivotal moment during a candid conversation with Slaven Bilic on the show 'Failure of the Champion', revealing how a trip to the Dominican Republic helped him change his mind.

The Serbian's wife, Jelena Djokovic, previously recounted the emotional episode in a 2020 interview with journalist Graham Bensinger, saying: ""After that match, he wanted to quit.

""He gathered all the members of his team and told them, 'You know what: I'm done, I'm quitting.' We cried and told him that he couldn't do it, that it wasn't the right time. He didn't want to play tennis, and he didn't even want to see a ball pass in front of him.""

Djokovic was so heartbroken that his wife, who has known the tennis star since high school, revealed he had directed his then-agent, Edoardo Artaldi, to inform his sponsors, including Lacoste, of his intention to pause his career. ""It was a terrible loss,"" she said.

""And then he just, you know, gathered all of us and said, 'You know guys, I'm done.' And I was like, 'What?' And he goes like, 'Yeah.' He said, 'Edoardo, you can speak with my sponsors.

""I want to be clear with them. I don't know if I'm stopping for six months, a year, or forever. Just tell them if they feel like sticking around they can. If they don't, I'm happy. I just want to make sure everybody is OK with this.'""

Yet, it was Djokovic's wife and their children, Stefan and Tara, who motivated him to reconsider and step back onto the court. ""He didn't want to know anything about it,"" Jelena recounted. ""But I love tennis and I take the kids to the court every day. On the third day, Novak arrived.

""He saw we were having fun, and it wasn't the intense training he was accustomed to for years. Novak asked me if he could play and get a racket, but I refused.

""I started teasing him, saying he had quit and now it was our turn to play tennis. Eventually, he served and felt good, then returned daily until he finally called his coach Marian Vajda to start training again.""

His change of heart turned out to be arguably the most brilliant move of his career, as he racked up an additional 12 Grand Slam titles, achieving an unprecedented total of 24. Despite striving for a 25th trophy, his journey at the French Open was cut short in the semi-finals by world No. 1 Jannik Sinner.

Following his exit, the sporting great fueled speculation about his future at Roland Garros when he offered an emotional salute to every section of Court Philippe-Chatrier and affectionately touched the clay. He conceded in the aftermath during a press conference: ""This could have been the last match I ever played here, so I don't know.

""That's why I was a bit more emotional even in the end. But if this was the farewell match of the Roland Garros for me in my career, it was a wonderful one in terms of the atmosphere and what I got from the crowd.""

Tennis

French Open

Case closed. The end of the argument. Best-of-five-set-tennis haters in shambles.

Whether tennis should eliminate its longest format is an ongoing discussion, but for its advocates, Sunday's instant classic French Open final between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz was the ultimate endorsement.

Five and a half hours of undulating tension and elite-level competition, given deeper meaning by how its length raised the significance of the match's decisive moments. The format allowed the match to take on an epic quality, elevating Sinner and Alcaraz's rivalry, previously incipient to the wider world outside of tennis, into something transcendental. The Wimbledon finals between Björn Borg and John McEnroe in 1980, and then Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in 2008, had the same effect.

The highs of matches such as Sunday's are a compelling, possibly inarguable, case for the upsides of the format outweighing the downsides, but for dedicated tennis followers, the downsides are harder to ignore.

However, for regular watchers of the sport, there most certainly are downsides. Five-set matches such as the Sinner-Alcaraz classic are rare. While their computer-game fast, extremely physical and incredibly powerful tennis is awe-inspiring, it's more often the case that even matches between two of the world's best players have sags and dips. Alcaraz and Sinner met in last year's French Open semifinal in another five-set match. That one was scratchy and strange. They rarely played well at the same time, and with both of them having physical issues toward the end, there was a lot of energy conservation at the end of sets.

A more typical five-set Grand Slam match would be something like Tommy Paul vs. Karen Khachanov from this year's fourth round. Two well-matched players — the No. 12 seed and the No. 24 seed — swapping sets for four hours, seven minutes. On Sunday, no one wanted Sinner vs. Alcaraz to end. More often, five-set matches ebb unsatisfyingly before eventually reaching the end.

Tennis was not designed to take anywhere near this long. It was conceived of as a sport where even five-set matches would take a maximum of two hours. The first Wimbledon final that went to five sets, in 1887 between Herbert Lawford and Ernest Renshaw, lasted 120 minutes. More than 50 years later, the 1949 final between Ted Schroeder and Jaroslav Drobný lasted 100 minutes. That's only 15 minutes longer than just the second set of the 2023 final between Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic. A glance at five-set Wimbledon finals from the first half of the 20th century shows matches between 95 and 135 minutes.

Match lengths have steadily increased since, and the rate of rise has steepened since the turn of this century. As of June 2023, they had become 25 percent longer on average since 1999. Three-hour matches, previously the marker of something epic, had become close to the average. This is due to a complex combination of surface and equipment changes, advances in fitness and changes in dominant game styles, but the net result is longer matches, more often.

The increased length and physicality have a knock-on effect through tournaments. Players who come through a five-setter at a Grand Slam may be wiped out for their next match, or by the start of the second week, if they've had a few long ones. At the Australian Open in January, a number of fourth-round matches included either blowouts or mid-match retirements from players who had burned themselves out physically in the first week. Jack Draper withdrew at the end of the second set against Alcaraz, having played five-setters in all three of his previous matches.

With Grand Slams drawn so that high-seeded players such as Draper are drawn to face weaker opponents early on, there are some who like this karmic aspect of the best-of-five format: mess around against an overmatched opponent and pay for it down the line. However, the density and depth of quality on the ATP Tour have grown in line with match lengths to the point that sometimes players are just dragged into a war of attrition, leaving one player losing and the other scoring a pyrrhic victory.

The longer format also drastically reduces the number of viable champions. Very few players can consistently withstand the demands of best-of-five tennis against the best in the world; upsets are less likely because the better player has more time to work things out.

All of which raises questions about who the formats are there to serve. For fans, the tension is between how much intrigue is generated by the best matches and how dull the worst can be. Matches such as Sinner vs. Alcaraz catapult tennis into the wider sporting consciousness; when a less interesting match is tied at one-set all after two hours, its conclusion can feel so far away that changing channel is an entirely reasonable response.

Then there's the question of the players, who generally like best of five because it's seen as the ultimate test and one that will typically lead to the best player winning. It's a lot harder to sneak a best-of-five win than a best-of-three one.

One would be for the Grand Slams to have a hybrid system: best of three for the first three or four rounds; best of five for the last three or four rounds. The biggest matches could go long, but without so much accumulated fatigue from earlier in the tournament, and the early-round grinds would be eliminated. The switch from shorter to longer matches mid-tournament could be problematic for the players physically, but they already have to make that adjustment for majors, with all other tour events played to three sets.

This hybrid format could also be used in the women's events, creating equality and taking away situations like those at the French Open, where men are given the prime scheduling slots because, according to tournament organizers, they are longer and therefore offer fans better value for money.

WTA players are generally not enthused by the idea of playing five sets, however. There is precedent — between 1984 and 1998, the final of the year-ending WTA Finals was best of five.

All of this remains theoretical because the slams have never shown any inclination to tweak the best-of-five format. They post record attendances and revenues, and longer matches generally mean people in the grounds for longer, with more scope to spend more of their money. And while the Sinner vs. Alcaraz final is proof of the majesty of tennis' most gladiatorial format, it's important to remember that matches of that level are the exception rather than the norm.

The takeaways from Carlos Alcaraz's fifth-set tiebreaker victory over Jannik Sinner in the riveting and record-breaking French Open men's final were multiple and significant.

Let's start with this: Anyone worried about how men's tennis would survive in the post-Big Three era can rest easy. Alcaraz and Sinner produced 5¢ hours of evidence Sunday that the game is in good hands — and that their rivalry will be, and perhaps already is, a transcendent one.

Take it from no less an authority than Roger Federer. The retired owner of 20 Grand Slam titles, and rival of Rafael Nadal (22 majors) and Novak Djokovic (24), began a post on social media by declaring, “3 winners in Paris today,” then listed Alcaraz, Sinner and “the beautiful game of tennis. What a match!”

Renew the rivalry

This was the 12th Alcaraz-Sinner meeting, the first in a major final.

“Hopefully not the last time,” Alcaraz said. “Every time that we face … each other, we raise our level to the top.”

It would be shocking if there weren't many more of these to come — perhaps as soon as at Wimbledon, where play begins on June 30 and No. 2-ranked Alcaraz is the two-time defending champion.

His comeback against No. 1 Sinner from two sets down, then three championship points down, to win 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (10-2) was unprecedented at Roland-Garros. It was unforgettable. Alcaraz's coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero, described his guy's best trait this way: “His strength is (to) keep believing all the time, until the last ball is gone.”

Five at 22

Alcaraz's five Grand Slam titles at 22 — that's the age at which Nadal, Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras also got to five; no one's done it younger — show how special he is. So does the Spaniard's 5-0 record in major finals, a career start surpassed among men only by Federer's 7-0.

Sinner is pretty good, too. Tuesday marks a full year that he has been ranked No. 1. He has reached the finals of his last eight tournaments, a run last accomplished by Djokovic a decade ago. He has won three majors. He has won 47 of his last 50 matches.

Notably, all three of those losses came against — yes, you guessed it — Alcaraz. That hearkens back to the days when Federer would beat everyone other than Nadal.

Sinner had claimed 31 Slam sets in a row right up until the moment he was up 2-0 against Alcaraz.

What was unmistakable to anyone watching in-person at Court Philippe-Chatrier or following along from afar on TV is that Alcaraz vs. Sinner is a must-see.

“The level,” Alcaraz said, “was insane.”

Alcaraz and Sinner have won the last 6 Grand Slam titles

Sinner's take?

“I'm happy to be part of this,” the 23-year-old Italian said. “Would be even more happy if I would have … the big trophy.”

As with any great rivalry — think Evert vs. Navratilova or Borg vs. McEnroe or Federer vs. Nadal, no first names needed — Alcaraz vs. Sinner provides a clash of excellence and a study in contrasts.

Alcaraz displays emotion, pumping his fists, pointing to an ear to ask for more noise, yelling “Vamos!” Sinner is rather contained. Sinner's long limbs get him to nearly every ball. Alcaraz's motor reaches speeds no one can equal. Sinner's ball-striking is pure. Alcaraz's drop shots are legendary. Both hammer groundstrokes that leave opponents exasperated and spectators gasping.

Both can improve. Sinner has never won a match that lasted four hours. Alcaraz loses focus on occasion.

Both are eager to improve. When Sinner returned from a three-month doping ban last month, he introduced a new, angled return stance. Alcaraz tweaked his serve and backhand technique.

Who knows what heights each can reach? They split the past six Slam trophies, and eight of the past 11.

Saw it coming

Roger Federer predicted big champions would come along again.

During an interview with The Associated Press in December 2019, Federer predicted someone would win major after major the way he, Nadal and Djokovic did. Just didn't know there would be a Big Two doing it.

“It's going to happen, inevitably,” Federer said. “And it's almost not going to be that hard, maybe … because the players will have seen what we did. And they didn't see just one guy doing it, once every 30 years. They saw like three guys doing it, in the shortest period of time. … Players are going to believe more.”

Carlos Alcaraz has ascended the ranks of tennis' wealthiest players following his victory at the French Open.

The young star in a grueling five-set final at Roland Garros on Sunday, successfully defending his title. The win reportedly netted Alcaraz a hefty $2.8 million prize, catapulting him to seventh place on the list of tennis players with the highest career earnings.

With 20 ATP Tour titles and five Grand Slams under his belt, Alcaraz's total prize money is estimated to be around $44.7M. His recent French Open win also allowed him to surpass Pete Sampras, who reportedly earned just over $43M before retiring in 2002.

According to the official ATP site, Alcaraz has already raked in $6.8M this year alone, boasting four titles and an impressive record of 37 wins and five losses.

His most lucrative season so far was in 2023 when he ended the year with a whopping $15.1M in earnings, a year that also saw him clinch his first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon by defeating Novak Djokovic.

However, if Alcaraz aims to surpass Djokovic's best single-season earnings this year, he still has a long way to go. The Serbian legend, holder of a record 24 Grand Slam titles, reportedly earned a staggering $21.1M in 2015.

Unsurprisingly, the 38-year-old tennis legend tops the list of all-time highest earners in the sport, boasting a whopping $187M in prize money. And with Djokovic still in top form, it's likely he'll continue to add to this impressive total.

Alcaraz is set to increase his earnings when he returns to Wimbledon this summer, aiming for a third consecutive victory in London. While the exact prize money for this year's Grand Slam remains unknown, Alcaraz reportedly pocketed $3.6M from the event last year.

Also topping the tennis wealth chart in terms of career earnings are Rafael Nadal in second place ($134M), Roger Federer in third ($130M), Andy Murray in fourth ($64M), Alexander Zverev in fifth ($53M), and Daniil Medvedev in sixth ($46M).

At just 22, Alcaraz has ample time to catch up with the 'Big Four'. The same goes for Sinner, who currently sits behind Sampras with his $41.5M earnings but ahead of Stan Wawrinka, who completes the current top 10 with $37.6M.

All eyes will undoubtedly be on the remaining two majors of the year, which will allow the sport's stars to bolster their earnings further. Wimbledon takes place in London between June 30 and July 13, while the U.S. Open lands at the UTSA Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre in New York between August 24 and September 7.

Nick Kyrgios is not due to return for the BBC's coverage of Wimbledon this year, despite the Australian appearing as a pundit on last summer's Championships.

It comes after the broadcaster copped backlash after including the 30-year-old tennis player in its coverage of the 2024 tournament, 12 months after Kyrgios had admitted to assaulting his former girlfriend Chiara Passari.

The Telegraph now claims that the BBC won't be welcoming the Australian former Wimbledon runner-up back for its coverage for the 2025 event.

The outlet adds that he will not appear on ESPN's American coverage of the event. He had joined up to work for the broadcaster at the Australian Open in January following his first-round exit by Jacob Fearnley. The seven-time winner on the ATP Tour had worked for ESPN for their Australian Open coverage back in 2024 also.

Sources state that Kyrgios had planned to enter the tournament, unlike last year, despite now having withdrawn from the event.

Kyrgios has been hampered by injuries over the past two years and a fresh injury setback at the start of June saw him explain to fans on social media that he would no longer be able to participate in the grass season.

Nick Kyrgios has reportedly been dropped by the BBC from it's Wimbledon coverage 

The BBC received backlash last year after including Kyrgios on it's coverage a year after he admitted to assaulting his ex-girlfriend Chiara Passari

'I've hit a small setback in my recovery and unfortunately won't make it back for grass season this year,' Kyrgios posted on social media.

'I know how much you've all been looking forward to seeing me out there, and I'm genuinely sorry to disappoint. This is just a bump in the road though, and I'm already working hard to get back stronger than ever.'

The BBC defended their decision to hire Kyrgios after MPs and multiple other groups condemned their decision to hire the Australian.

Conservative MP Caroline Noakes and the women and equalities committee chair, questioned the appointment of Kyrgios to the BBC's coverage, saying it was insulting towards women.

'The BBC should hang its head in shame at this appointment,' said Nokes. 'It's a disgrace and shows the utter contempt our national broadcaster has towards women.

'Not content with consistently underpaying their own female staff and forcing out women once they hit a certain age, they now bring a man who admitted assaulting a woman on board for Wimbledon.'

Jamie Klingler, a co-founder of the Reclaim These Streets campaign group, said: '‘It's amazing how quickly we are willing to dismiss violence against women as long as the man perpetrating that violence is good at hitting a ball.'

Amid the storm of criticism, the BBC justified its position.

'As a current and high profile player, Nick Kyrgios will provide insight and analysis of the action on the court from his experience in the game,' the BBC said in a statement.

'We are in no way condoning his cited previous actions or behaviours, on and off the court, and he is employed to share his views on tennis only. He has provided similar services to other major sports broadcasters in recent months.

'The legal process he was involved in has concluded, is well documented, and he has spoken about it publicly.'

The charges against Kyrgios were dismissed, despite the tennis player pleading guilty to shoving his ex-girlfriend. In her judgement, Magistrate Beth Campbell said the act was a 'single act of stupidity' adding that the act was not planned or premeditated. Kyrgios avoided a criminal conviction.

He later explained he 'deeply regretted' the incident.

'I know it wasn't OK and I'm sincerely sorry for the hurt I caused,' Kyrgios added.

The 30-year-old has battled back from foot, knee and wrist injuries over the past two years, but his withdrawal means he will extend his absence at the Grand Slam for the third year on the bounce.

Kyrgios had appeared to make a comeback on the ATP Tour at the end of last year, having overcome undergoing surgery on a wrist-ligament injury.

The 30-year-old had pulled out of this year's Wimbledon championships, meaning it is the third year in a row he will not be competing at the tournament

It also comes after he reportedly split up with his girlfriend Costeen Hatzi in recent months

But the issue, among several other problems, have plagued Kyrgios over the past seven months.

An abdominal strain suffered in January threatened to derail his Australian Open comeback before Kyrgios went on to suffer defeat in the first round by Jacob Fearnley.

He has since struggled to play, citing rustiness in his wrist, making just four appearances so far this season, while winning just one match against Mackenzie McDonald at the ATP Masters in Miami in March.

During his injury hiatus, Kyrgios was also critical of the doping saga that engulfed Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner last year.

The Italian was later banned for three months for breaching the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) rules last year after he provided two positive drugs tests.

‘Two world No 1s both getting done for doping is disgusting for our sport,' Kyrgios said, referring to Sinner and Iga Swiatek, who also accepted a doping suspension last year. ‘It's a horrible look.

‘Tennis integrity right now, and everyone knows it but no one wants to speak about it, it's awful.'

However, American sports journalist Jon Wertheim appeared to claim on his Served podcast that Kyrgios' repeated attacks on Sinner related to the Italian dating his ex-girlfriend Anna Kalinskaya.

Kyrgios later rubbished those claims stating that he was happy with his most recent girlfriend Costeen Hatzi.

However, in recent months The Herald Sun reports that Kyrgios and Hatzi, who has frequently been seen supporting him on the ATP Tour, have broken up.

Former Wimbledon winner Marion Bartoli gave Jannik Sinner's rivals one big tip on how to beat the world No 1 and Carlos Alcaraz heeded that advice during the French Open final.

During the early stages of the clay-court Grand Slam, the Frenchwoman stated on Prime Video Sport France: “He's a puncher, a hitter. He's made enormous physical progress; today he's a real athlete.

“[But] we know that the 4:30 mark is a bit of a fatal bar for Sinner. Beyond that, he starts to get stuck physically, but we have to take him beyond 4:30 of play.”

Bartoli's comment was backed up by statistics as Sinner has a poor record in long matches as at that point he had lost all six of his matches that were longer than three hours and 50 minutes.

In case you were wondering, the 2024 Australian Open final against Daniil Medvedev lasted three hours and 44 minutes.

Six defeats became seven after the Roland Garros final against Alcaraz as that also went the distance.

It became clear that during the latter stages of the match that the Spaniard had more in the tank than his opponent with Alcaraz eventually winning 4-6, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (10-2) in five hours in 29 minutes with the match the second-longest Grand Slam final in the Open Era.

Jannik Sinner has one ‘fatal' weakness that a brutal statistic confirms

French Open ATP Winners & Losers: Alcaraz's joy, Sinner's heartbreak…and a Djokovic farewell?

The Italian is now 6-10 in matches that have gone to a fifth set and he has lost eight of his last nine Grand Slam matches that have gone to a decider.

Three of those defeats have come against Alcaraz while Novak Djokovic, Alexander Zverev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Medvedev and Daniel Altmaier have also claimed wins.

Sinner was asked about fading physically late during long matches following his devastating loss to Alcaraz in Paris.

“No, you cannot compare this match with other matches, I believe,” he said.

“Physically I was quite fine. Of course, tired. He was tired too, you know, because it was physical match. It was mental match. What can you do? You know, now knowing the result, it is what it is, you know? You can't really change it.

“I'm still happy to be part of this match. You know, I think it was a very, very high-level match, was long. Yeah, and it happens. You know, we saw it in the past with other players, and today it happened to me.

“So we try to delete it somehow and take the positive and keep going. There are no other ways.”

Tennis

French Open

Case closed. The end of the argument. Best-of-five-set-tennis haters in shambles.

Whether tennis should eliminate its longest format is an ongoing discussion, but for its advocates, Sunday's instant classic French Open final between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz was the ultimate endorsement.

Five and a half hours of undulating tension and elite-level competition, given deeper meaning by how its length raised the significance of the match's decisive moments. The format allowed the match to take on an epic quality, elevating Sinner and Alcaraz's rivalry, previously incipient to the wider world outside of tennis, into something transcendental. The Wimbledon finals between Björn Borg and John McEnroe in 1980, and then Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in 2008, had the same effect.

The highs of matches such as Sunday's are a compelling, possibly inarguable, case for the upsides of the format outweighing the downsides, but for dedicated tennis followers, the downsides are harder to ignore.

However, for regular watchers of the sport, there most certainly are downsides. Five-set matches such as the Sinner-Alcaraz classic are rare. While their computer-game fast, extremely physical and incredibly powerful tennis is awe-inspiring, it's more often the case that even matches between two of the world's best players have sags and dips. Alcaraz and Sinner met in last year's French Open semifinal in another five-set match. That one was scratchy and strange. They rarely played well at the same time, and with both of them having physical issues toward the end, there was a lot of energy conservation at the end of sets.

A more typical five-set Grand Slam match would be something like Tommy Paul vs. Karen Khachanov from this year's fourth round. Two well-matched players — the No. 12 seed and the No. 24 seed — swapping sets for four hours, seven minutes. On Sunday, no one wanted Sinner vs. Alcaraz to end. More often, five-set matches ebb unsatisfyingly before eventually reaching the end.

Tennis was not designed to take anywhere near this long. It was conceived of as a sport where even five-set matches would take a maximum of two hours. The first Wimbledon final that went to five sets, in 1887 between Herbert Lawford and Ernest Renshaw, lasted 120 minutes. More than 50 years later, the 1949 final between Ted Schroeder and Jaroslav Drobný lasted 100 minutes. That's only 15 minutes longer than just the second set of the 2023 final between Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic. A glance at five-set Wimbledon finals from the first half of the 20th century shows matches between 95 and 135 minutes.

Match lengths have steadily increased since, and the rate of rise has steepened since the turn of this century. As of June 2023, they had become 25 percent longer on average since 1999. Three-hour matches, previously the marker of something epic, had become close to the average. This is due to a complex combination of surface and equipment changes, advances in fitness and changes in dominant game styles, but the net result is longer matches, more often.

The increased length and physicality have a knock-on effect through tournaments. Players who come through a five-setter at a Grand Slam may be wiped out for their next match, or by the start of the second week, if they've had a few long ones. At the Australian Open in January, a number of fourth-round matches included either blowouts or mid-match retirements from players who had burned themselves out physically in the first week. Jack Draper withdrew at the end of the second set against Alcaraz, having played five-setters in all three of his previous matches.

With Grand Slams drawn so that high-seeded players such as Draper are drawn to face weaker opponents early on, there are some who like this karmic aspect of the best-of-five format: mess around against an overmatched opponent and pay for it down the line. However, the density and depth of quality on the ATP Tour have grown in line with match lengths to the point that sometimes players are just dragged into a war of attrition, leaving one player losing and the other scoring a pyrrhic victory.

The longer format also drastically reduces the number of viable champions. Very few players can consistently withstand the demands of best-of-five tennis against the best in the world; upsets are less likely because the better player has more time to work things out.

All of which raises questions about who the formats are there to serve. For fans, the tension is between how much intrigue is generated by the best matches and how dull the worst can be. Matches such as Sinner vs. Alcaraz catapult tennis into the wider sporting consciousness; when a less interesting match is tied at one-set all after two hours, its conclusion can feel so far away that changing channel is an entirely reasonable response.

Then there's the question of the players, who generally like best of five because it's seen as the ultimate test and one that will typically lead to the best player winning. It's a lot harder to sneak a best-of-five win than a best-of-three one.

One would be for the Grand Slams to have a hybrid system: best of three for the first three or four rounds; best of five for the last three or four rounds. The biggest matches could go long, but without so much accumulated fatigue from earlier in the tournament, and the early-round grinds would be eliminated. The switch from shorter to longer matches mid-tournament could be problematic for the players physically, but they already have to make that adjustment for majors, with all other tour events played to three sets.

This hybrid format could also be used in the women's events, creating equality and taking away situations like those at the French Open, where men are given the prime scheduling slots because, according to tournament organizers, they are longer and therefore offer fans better value for money.

WTA players are generally not enthused by the idea of playing five sets, however. There is precedent — between 1984 and 1998, the final of the year-ending WTA Finals was best of five.

All of this remains theoretical because the slams have never shown any inclination to tweak the best-of-five format. They post record attendances and revenues, and longer matches generally mean people in the grounds for longer, with more scope to spend more of their money. And while the Sinner vs. Alcaraz final is proof of the majesty of tennis' most gladiatorial format, it's important to remember that matches of that level are the exception rather than the norm.

The BBC won't be the only TV channel with live Wimbledon coverage in the UK- with TNT Sports to also broadcast the singles finals for the first time.

This year's tournament gets underway on 30 June, with the men's singles final wrapping up play on 13 July. Fresh from outlasting Jannik Sinner at the French Open in one of the greatest Grand Slam finals of all-time, Carlos Alcaraz will be looking to win at Wimbledon for the third successive year.

Last year, a peak of 7.5 million people tuned into BBC One to see Alcaraz defeat Novak Djokovic in the final, with the match also streamed live 1.78 million times on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport online.

Meanwhile during the ladies' singles final, where Barbora Krejcikova was victorious over Jasmine Paolini, there was a peak audience of 4.1 million on BBC One. The match was also streamed live 1.34 million times on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport online.

The BBC do retain the majority of the rights this year thanks to the fact that the tournament is listed as a Category A event by Ofcom. That means that live coverage must be made available for free-to-air channels and the corporation duly go out over the two weeks.

But the rule also allows paid networks to share live coverage, as long as it continues to be shown on terrestrial television. That has allowed TNT Sports to take over Eurosport's deal to show the finals for the first time.

Eurosport chiefs signed a new five-year deal with the All England Club last year, having shown highlights of each day and live coverage of both finals since 2016. But with TNT Sports now falling under the Discovery umbrella, and Eurosport no more, Wimbledon heads onto TNT for the first time.

On the BBC, the presenting line-up is yet to be confirmed, though two-time Wimbledon champion Andy Murray has been linked with a role as a pundit. His coaching partnership with Djokovic recently came to an end, opening the door to a broadcast role at the championships.

Murray was previously in the commentary box in 2018 after undergoing his first hip surgery. His former mentee Djokovic will be looking to equal Roger Federer's all-time record of eight Wimbledon titles.

The BBC are also making a key change for this year's championships. The broadcaster is looking to significantly cut the delay between the version of BBC Two broadcast via Freeview and the iPlayer.

A test will be held during Wimbledon giving selected iPlayer beta users access to a low latency version of the BBC Two live stream. This should cut down the delay.

The test was announced in a BBC blog post, which explained the move will help the broadcaster “assess how well low latency streaming approaches perform over today's internet into our viewer's homes.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Serena Williams' ex-coach makes controversial Coco Gauff claim about women's tennis","https://www.themirror.com/sport/tennis/serena-williams-ex-coach-makes-1199046","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 13:43:00 GMT","

Patrick Mouratoglou, the former coach of Serena Williams, believes Coco Gauff is the only superstar currently competing in women's tennis.

Gauff became a two-time Grand Slam winner in the women's singles on Saturday by beating Aryna Sabalenka in the French Open final. The 21-year-old is quickly becoming one of the biggest stars in American sports, having previously won the U.S. Open in 2023.

Saturday's final was overshadowed by Sabalenka suggesting Gauff had won because of her poor play rather than her opponent's brilliance. Gauff quickly dismissed these comments while speaking to the press before Sabalenka explained herself on Instagram.

While Mouratoglou is right to suggest Gauff is a superstar, his opinion on the rest of women's tennis is controversial. World No. 1 Sabalenka is one of the most popular figures in men's or women's tennis right now, boasting three million Instagram followers.

Men's World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has 3.6 million followers on the same social media platform, which isn't too different from Sabalenka's tally. Fellow women's tennis stars Naomi Osaka and Emma Raducanu also boast more than two million Instagram followers each.

Speaking on his Instagram account, Mouratoglou said: ""There is a real difference between being a top player playing incredible tennis and a star. I explained that women's tennis at the moment lacks superstars.

""So there is one big star I think in women's tennis, which is Coco, in terms of, you know, aura is higher than anyone at the moment.""

Mouratoglou then referenced the level of superstardom Serena Williams, her sister Venus, and Maria Sharapova all enjoyed during their glittering careers.

He added: ""I'm not saying that they will not be in the future. I said that there have been huge superstars in women's tennis. I'm thinking about Serena, Venus, Sharapova.""

The French coach's verdict angered many fans on social media, who were quick to point out Sabalenka's star power. ""Sabalenka is miles ahead of Coco,"" wrote one fan, while another claimed: ""Sabalenka is a star. Her personality is awesome. Naomi Osaka, too, has it.""

Mouratoglou has coached some of the biggest names in tennis, including Osaka, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Holger Rune, Marcos Baghdatis, and Simona Halep. He went on to share how Serena Williams would attract more fans than anyone else in women's tennis.

He said: ""When we went to Bostad in Sweden with Serena, the year before the final of Bostad, the stadium was not full. Serena comes. Before the start of the tournament, the stadium is sold out (for) the whole week. Superstars fill up stadiums.

""Take a taxi and ask questions. (I ask), 'Oh do you know tennis?' (They reply), 'No I'm not a tennis fan.' (I ask), 'Okay who do you know?' 90 percent of the time... (it's) Serena.

""Those people are not tennis fans, but they know Serena. Everybody knows Serena. This is the difference with real.""

Emma Raducanu thrashed qualifier Cristina Bucsa 6-1, 6-2 as she began her singles campaign at Queen's on Tuesday afternoon. 

The former US Open champion spoke of her love of small courts after her box-office doubles partnership with Katie Boulter was buried on Court One on Monday due to television rights obligations, but she looked more than at home on the newly named Andy Murray Arena. 

So comfortable, in fact, that looming concerns over a back injury suffered in the build-up appeared a world away on Tuesday afternoon, as Raducanu had as an easy a time as her compatriot Boulter had toiled against Ajla Tomljanovic in the earlier match. 

While Bucsa does not register as one of her most fearsome opponents to date, the world No116 was unable to lay a glove on Raducanu - who, if she can make a deep run at The Queen's Club, could go into Wimbledon as British No1 again. 

After gritting her teeth to hold onto her serve in the third game, Raducanu was scarcely troubled in the first set as she planted her flag firmly on the tournament's centre court, with the player noting after the match she was 'particularly locked in' in the afternoon sunshine. 

Raducanu looked particularly confident at pace, claiming the first break of the match with a lightly popped backhand volley that Bucsa, mercilessly dragged across all four corners of the court, hadn't a hope of reaching. 

Emma Raducanu scythed her way past Cristina Bucsa to book her spot in the second round

The 22-year-old was moving well after lowering expectations on before the tournament start

Raducanu will now look ahead to facing either Barbora Krejcikova or Rebecca Sramkova

Another on-the-run forehand and a string of flashing baseline winners made Bucsa look out of place wherever she positioned herself, with Raducanu sprinting to the finish of the opening set as if she had a train to catch. 

When Raducanu plays like this, it can be a challenge not to get carried away thinking of her miraculous rise to prominence. Should she ever hope to match that undreamed-of US Open win, beating a doubles specialist who has gone through two rounds of qualifying like Bucsa will only be the first step of many, but you can only play the opponent in front of you. Raducanu did so like a tornado ripping up a frontier town. 

In front of an appreciative home crowd, Raducanu started the second set as comfortably as she had won the first, and was only tested for the first time five games in. Bucsa's first hold for some time was hard fought, but after an exchange of advantages, the Spaniard could walk back to her chair after the game with her head a little higher after serving up a zippy ace to finally claim it. 

But a remontada this was not; although Bucsa had Raducanu beaten after pushing her into a deep cross-court backhand before wafting a drop shot into acres of empty court for 30-30, and proved nettlesome as Raducanu's service level briefly dropped. But after pulling off the sticky hold for 5-1, winning the match on her racquet was child's play. 

Raducanu may have tried to play down British hopes with warnings of her 'pretty low expectations' in west London, but she will have a harder time convincing Tuesday's crowd after performances like this.

Naomi Osaka Flexes Outfit While Teasing Wimbledon Return originally appeared on Athlon Sports.

Tennis champion Naomi Osaka is keeping her spirits high and focusing on the positive despite an early exit at the 2025 French Open.

Following the heartbreaking loss to 10th-seeded Paula Badosa, she seems ready for another round of action on the court.

In her latest Instagram post, the 27-year-old shared her plans for the upcoming season.

Moreover, she teased her followers with a potential return to Wimbledon with a confident caption and a striking outfit that left fans buzzing with anticipation.

“One more for the kit. Grass season up next. And thank you for the hospitality @hoteldeberri,” she wrote, along with a short clip of her doing a fit check.

In the video, Naomi Osaka's outfit showed her playful approach to her game-day look.

The four-time Grand Slam champion wore a baby-pink minidress from Nike that she paired with a cherry blossom-inspired shoe from the brand.

At Roland Garros, she stepped onto the court in her signature Nike GP Challenge 1s, a vibrant mix of four striking shades: Pink Foam, Pale Pink, Hyper Pink and Polarized Pink.

On top of this, she rocked a Sailor Moon-inspired space bun hairstyle that truly stole the show.

Following her teasing caption, fans flooded the comment section with excitement, expressing their desire to see Osaka bounce back from her French Open exit.

“Fits been top tier, can't wait to see what you have for Wimbledon,” one wrote.

“You'll do so great at Wimbledon, I just feel it. I wish you joy in all its different forms leading up to Wimby and even as you play,” a fan said.

A commenter left a playful remark and said, “CAN'T WAIT FOR GRASSAKA.”

“Congrats and good luck to the Queen,” another added.

Of course, her followers are swooning over the Nike kit she wore during her last game.

“That dress is my fave! Love that neckline. Makes the arms pop! And the skirt with the layers makes it feminine. So cute!” a commenter noted.

A fan echoed the same and said, “FITS GO CRAZY! ALWAYS.”

The Japanese tennis player made her comeback to Wimbledon in 2024 for the first time in six years.

Osaka managed to win the opening round against Diane Parry of France but fell short against American player Emma Navarro in the second round.

Meanwhile, the upcoming Wimbledon Championship 2025 will take place from June 30 to July 13 in London, England.

 The past six major championships have been dominated by the same four faces: Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy, Xander Schauffele and Bryson DeChambeau. 

 Not only have they combined to win those six titles, they've dotted the top 10 on every leaderboard, contending and pushing one another. 

 All four of those stars own multiple majors, and the sport hasn't had a first-time winner since Brian Harman at the 2023 Open Championship. We might be overdue for a newcomer as the USGA sets up Oakmont Country Club for the U.S. Open this week. 

 Here are five golfers on the precipice of their major championship breakthrough and why there's reason to believe they could be in the mix on Sunday in Pennsylvania. 

 Tommy Fleetwood 

 I remain convinced Fleetwood will win a major before his time is up. 

 He top-10'd at every major between 2022 and 2024 as his game seems to get better with age. Fleetwood ranks seventh on the PGA Tour in total strokes gained this season, and he isn't lacking in any one area. In particular, he's steady off the tee, and accurate driving is sure to be one of the keys at Oakmont with its thick rough. 

 In the past four U.S. Opens, 70 percent of players' strokes gained off the tee came from accuracy, only 30 percent from distance. 

 Sepp Straka 

 Nobody, not even in the highest ranks of golf cognoscenti, saw Straka coming. His own brother was more highly recruited to play college golf. 

 Now the Austria native-turned-Alabama resident is one of the hottest players in the world, with wins at the American Express and the Truist Championship to show for it. 

 Some of these rankings are wild: Second in total strokes gained! First in birdie average and greens in regulation percentage! He's also 11th in driving accuracy, and at the U.S. Open last year at Pinehurst No. 2, Straka led the field in fairways in regulation. Don't be stunned if he's out in front at any point this week. 

 Marc Leishman 

 This spot could have gone to Joaquin Niemann, coming off a victory Sunday at LIV Golf Virginia, but his major history hasn't lived up to the lofty expectations around him. Niemann said himself that he thinks he's still far off from winning a major. 

 I'm eyeing Leishman, the veteran Australian who sits eighth in the LIV table this year, with a win at Doral and a top-10 Sunday. He tied for 14th at the 2024 U.S. Open and tied for 18th the last time it was held at Oakmont . 

 Most notably, Leishman qualified for the U.S. Open the old-fashioned way while a majority of LIV members dropped out, showing he's confident in his game. 

 Patrick Cantlay 

 The final round at Pinehurst was so consumed by DeChambeau vs. McIlroy that Cantlay's best showing at a major became an afterthought. Thanks to an opening 65 and no major blunders, he was in the top three at the end of every round and finished only two shots back. 

 The U.S. Open may be the major he's best suited to win. He has four straight top-15 finishes, and he ranked 14th in putting last year, ninth in 2023 and fourth in 2022. Listen, I know the bloom is off the rose with this guy, but I haven't forgotten the clutch putts Cantlay made in the 2021 FedEx Cup playoffs. 

 Sam Burns 

 Speaking of Americans who tend to get lost in the shuffle, all five of Burns' PGA Tour wins came between May 2021 and March 2023 before he fell off for a while. 

 He's rarely performed well in the majors, but his best showing just so happened to be a T9 at the 2024 U.S. Open. 

 Now he's building at the right time, as several top-20s culminated in his breakout weekend at the RBC Canadian Open. Statistically, Burns is also the best putter on tour this year. Now, did that help him win a playoff against Ryan Fox on Sunday? No, but it may keep him sane this week if the USGA decides to trick out the Oakmont greens.

When talking of the greats, men's tennis has been dominated by discussion about Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. There is no denying that all three have been wonderful players. They created a great rivalry, which pushed each of them on to achieve. Yet hard-court has had plenty of greats before that era. From the likes of Peter Sampras and Andre Agassi in the 1990s, back to Rod Laver in the sixties.

Whereas on grass the ball can skid away, while on clay it holds up. On a hard court, however, there is little deviation. Therefore, there are no excuses about the surface for players. The hard surface season constitutes a big part of the tennis year. Two of the four Grand Slams, the Australian Open, in January, and the US Open, in August and September, are both now played on the surface.

Despite the rankings being based on a variety of factors, selecting a list is still subjective and sure to create much debate. Some famous names miss out, including Boris Becker and Bjorn Borg, simply because others have more notable achievements. Here are the 10 best men's hard court players in tennis history.

The greatest clay court players in tennis history have been ranked. Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal feature in the top 10.

Andy Murray is undoubtedly one of the best British players in tennis history. His career could be looked upon in two ways. Given he reached 11 Grand Slam finals and won three, some might deduce he was unfortunate his career coincided with the likes of Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. Although the smart money would be on the Scot being blessed to play in such a golden era. He was no slouch on hard courts.

Whereas he's known for winning Wimbledon twice, his first slam victory was the 2012 US Open, in which he defeated Djokovic in the final. He was also very at home at the Australian Open, in which he reached the final five times. Sadly, he was never to win the competition, losing four times there to Djokovic. Although there's no denying his ability on the surface.

On the subject of great Australian hard-court players, Pat Rafter would be on the lips of many. He won back-to-back US Open titles in 1997 and 1998. Although nobody can deny his compatriot Rod Laver a place in the rankings. Laver is one of the greatest players in tennis history.

His era of the 1960s and 1970s was a time when both the Australian and US Opens were played on grass. He played into his late thirties, competing against later greats like Bjorn Borg. The colour TV footage available of him at the end of his career is rare, but a reminder of his fierce left-handed stroke and great play. All this with a wooden racket too.

 John McEnroe had to learn to become great on grass, eventually winning the Wimbledon title over Bjorn Borg in 1981. However, he was fantastic on hard courts straight off the bat. His three US Open victories in a row included two wins in the final over Borg in 1980 and 1981. That outstretched left arm serve of his caused opponents all sorts of problems.

As technically sound as he was, McEnroe was a dogged competitor. Even in his thirties, playing against far younger opponents, he could still pull it out of the bag. This was demonstrated when he reached the quarter-finals of the 1992 Australian Open by beating Boris Becker in straight sets.

 Ivan Lendl was imperious on hard courts. He won three US Opens in a row between 1985 and 1987. This was followed by two Australian Opens in a row from 1989 to 1990. In those five finals, he lost just two sets. A serious competitor, Lendl was not one for anything hi-jinx between points. It led some of his critics to call him dour.

This serious nature was underpinned by a deep love of the game. He was completely dedicated in his approach to health and fitness too. He is considered one of the best clay court players in history. Yet it was on the hard surface that he was most successful. It helped him to be world number one for a total of 270 weeks over the course of his 16-year playing career.

 Rafael Nadal was no slouch on any surface. Novak Djokovic called Nadal the toughest opponent he ever faced. His longevity and warrior-like spirit can be seen in his two Australian Open wins. The first came in a five-set victory over Roger Federer in 2009. He had to wait 13 years for the next, with another five-set win against Daniil Medvedev.

To consider also that in Nadal's six Grand Slam final wins on hard-court he had to beat Novak Djokovic twice and Roger Federer once. This is also a man who suffered chronic knee and ankle injuries, but still found a way to remain one of the very best over the course of 23 years.

Unsurprisingly, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, and Novak Djokovic all make the list, but who else joins them?

 Jimmy Connors won an astounding 109 tournaments in his 24-year career between 1972 and 1996. A big chunk of his success came on hard courts. He won the US Open five times, three of those coming on the hard courts at Flushing Meadows. Those wins came against Bjorn Borg and Ivan Lendl twice.

Connors was a defiant player who had great reserves of resilience. As a left-hander and having had surgery on his left wrist, he still came back to play some of the best tennis of his career in 1991 at the US Open despite being 39. He lost in straight sets to fourth seed Jim Courier in the semi-final.

 Andre Agassi had a great relationship with the Australian Open, winning it four times. Two of those wins were in his thirties. He also has the accolade of beating another 1990s tennis legend in the final of a Grand Slam. In 1995, he beat the defending champion Pete Sampras in four sets.

Agassi liked to dictate play from the baseline. He also had an excellent return of serve. He seemed to see the ball early, so he was able to take his shots early. Unusual in the fact that he stood somewhat short of 6 ft, Agassi was able to dominate taller, more powerful opponents.

 Pete Sampras is best known for dominating Wimbledon in the 1990s. In total, he won seven titles at the All-England Club. However, his first Grand Slam win came in 1990, when he shocked the tennis world as a 19-year-old. In the final, he beat Andre Agassi in straight sets.

Sampras has a good all-round game, and loved to serve and come in for the volley. This made him deadly on hard courts. He had an incredible ability to leap high in the air to smash down any attempted lobs against him. Put simply, Sampras is an all-time great on grass and hard-court.

It is humbling to consider that Novak Djokovic has won as many Grand Slams on hard courts as Pete Sampras across all surfaces in his entire career. For over 15 years, the Serb dominated the Australian Open. Between 2008 and 2023, he won it 10 times.

Many consider him to have the greatest two-handed backhand in the history of tennis. Incredibly durable, Djokovic has played close to 1,500 matches. Still, his win ratio on hard court remains impressively high. Perhaps his best game on the surface was the 2012 Australian Open final against Rafael Nadal. In a match lasting seven minutes shy of six hours, Djokovic finally won in five sets.

Novak Djokovic has indeed won more Grand Slams on hard courts than Roger Federer. The Serb has won more Grand Slams full stop. So, there will be plenty who believe Djokovic should top these rankings. However, such was Federer's style of play that he tops the list.

He could combine his play with great power and speed, along with grace and poise. All achieved with that seemingly effortless one-handed stroke. Federer very rarely looked flustered. There was at times little evidence to suggest he was even breaking into a sweat. His brilliance was very much responsible for raising interest in tennis in the mid-2000s.

When talking of the greats, men's tennis has been dominated by discussion about Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. There is no denying that all three have been wonderful players. They created a great rivalry, which pushed each of them on to achieve. Yet hard-court has had plenty of greats before that era. From the likes of Peter Sampras and Andre Agassi in the 1990s, back to Rod Laver in the sixties.

Whereas on grass the ball can skid away, while on clay it holds up. On a hard court, however, there is little deviation. Therefore, there are no excuses about the surface for players. The hard surface season constitutes a big part of the tennis year. Two of the four Grand Slams, the Australian Open, in January, and the US Open, in August and September, are both now played on the surface.

Despite the rankings being based on a variety of factors, selecting a list is still subjective and sure to create much debate. Some famous names miss out, including Boris Becker and Bjorn Borg, simply because others have more notable achievements. Here are the 10 best men's hard court players in tennis history.

The greatest clay court players in tennis history have been ranked. Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal feature in the top 10.

Andy Murray is undoubtedly one of the best British players in tennis history. His career could be looked upon in two ways. Given he reached 11 Grand Slam finals and won three, some might deduce he was unfortunate his career coincided with the likes of Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. Although the smart money would be on the Scot being blessed to play in such a golden era. He was no slouch on hard courts.

Whereas he's known for winning Wimbledon twice, his first slam victory was the 2012 US Open, in which he defeated Djokovic in the final. He was also very at home at the Australian Open, in which he reached the final five times. Sadly, he was never to win the competition, losing four times there to Djokovic. Although there's no denying his ability on the surface.

On the subject of great Australian hard-court players, Pat Rafter would be on the lips of many. He won back-to-back US Open titles in 1997 and 1998. Although nobody can deny his compatriot Rod Laver a place in the rankings. Laver is one of the greatest players in tennis history.

His era of the 1960s and 1970s was a time when both the Australian and US Opens were played on grass. He played into his late thirties, competing against later greats like Bjorn Borg. The colour TV footage available of him at the end of his career is rare, but a reminder of his fierce left-handed stroke and great play. All this with a wooden racket too.

 John McEnroe had to learn to become great on grass, eventually winning the Wimbledon title over Bjorn Borg in 1981. However, he was fantastic on hard courts straight off the bat. His three US Open victories in a row included two wins in the final over Borg in 1980 and 1981. That outstretched left arm serve of his caused opponents all sorts of problems.

As technically sound as he was, McEnroe was a dogged competitor. Even in his thirties, playing against far younger opponents, he could still pull it out of the bag. This was demonstrated when he reached the quarter-finals of the 1992 Australian Open by beating Boris Becker in straight sets.

 Ivan Lendl was imperious on hard courts. He won three US Opens in a row between 1985 and 1987. This was followed by two Australian Opens in a row from 1989 to 1990. In those five finals, he lost just two sets. A serious competitor, Lendl was not one for anything hi-jinx between points. It led some of his critics to call him dour.

This serious nature was underpinned by a deep love of the game. He was completely dedicated in his approach to health and fitness too. He is considered one of the best clay court players in history. Yet it was on the hard surface that he was most successful. It helped him to be world number one for a total of 270 weeks over the course of his 16-year playing career.

 Rafael Nadal was no slouch on any surface. Novak Djokovic called Nadal the toughest opponent he ever faced. His longevity and warrior-like spirit can be seen in his two Australian Open wins. The first came in a five-set victory over Roger Federer in 2009. He had to wait 13 years for the next, with another five-set win against Daniil Medvedev.

To consider also that in Nadal's six Grand Slam final wins on hard-court he had to beat Novak Djokovic twice and Roger Federer once. This is also a man who suffered chronic knee and ankle injuries, but still found a way to remain one of the very best over the course of 23 years.

Unsurprisingly, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, and Novak Djokovic all make the list, but who else joins them?

 Jimmy Connors won an astounding 109 tournaments in his 24-year career between 1972 and 1996. A big chunk of his success came on hard courts. He won the US Open five times, three of those coming on the hard courts at Flushing Meadows. Those wins came against Bjorn Borg and Ivan Lendl twice.

Connors was a defiant player who had great reserves of resilience. As a left-hander and having had surgery on his left wrist, he still came back to play some of the best tennis of his career in 1991 at the US Open despite being 39. He lost in straight sets to fourth seed Jim Courier in the semi-final.

 Andre Agassi had a great relationship with the Australian Open, winning it four times. Two of those wins were in his thirties. He also has the accolade of beating another 1990s tennis legend in the final of a Grand Slam. In 1995, he beat the defending champion Pete Sampras in four sets.

Agassi liked to dictate play from the baseline. He also had an excellent return of serve. He seemed to see the ball early, so he was able to take his shots early. Unusual in the fact that he stood somewhat short of 6 ft, Agassi was able to dominate taller, more powerful opponents.

 Pete Sampras is best known for dominating Wimbledon in the 1990s. In total, he won seven titles at the All-England Club. However, his first Grand Slam win came in 1990, when he shocked the tennis world as a 19-year-old. In the final, he beat Andre Agassi in straight sets.

Sampras has a good all-round game, and loved to serve and come in for the volley. This made him deadly on hard courts. He had an incredible ability to leap high in the air to smash down any attempted lobs against him. Put simply, Sampras is an all-time great on grass and hard-court.

Tennis legend Boris Becker recently sparked debate on social media when he disagreed with a list of the greatest Grand Slam finals shared on X. The German champion made it very clear that he doesn't agree with the inclusion of the Wimbledon final 2009 between Roger Federer and Andy Roddick in that list.

Federer defeated Roddick after four hours and 17 minutes with 5–7, 7–6(8–6), 7–6(7–5), 3–6, 16–14 at the 2009 Wimbledon final. This was one of the most significant parts of their rivalry as they were against each other for the third time in a Wimbledon final and the fourth time in a Grand Slam final. One notable thing from this match was that Roddick lost after holding serve for 37 straight games.

So, I've given it some thought…

My top 5 Grand Slam men's finals of all time:

1/ Nadal-Federer, Wimbledon 2008
2/ Borg-McEnroe, Wimbledon 1980
3/ Djokovic-Nadal, Australian Open 2012
4/ Federer-Roddick, Wimbledon 2009
5/ Alcaraz-Sinner, Roland-Garros 2025

Yesterday was top 5.

— Bastien Fachan (@BastienFachan) June 9, 2025

The six-time Grand Slam champion, Becker, clarified his preference by highlighting the 2017 Australian Open final between Federer and Nadal. Federer defeated his longtime rival 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 in what many consider one of the greatest comebacks in tennis history.

Federer, aged 35, returned from a six-month injury break. Neither player had reached a Grand Slam final in years, which made the match even more remarkable. After winning this match, Federer regained the World No.1 ranking and clinched his 18th Grand Slam title, making this match even memorable.

Don't agree with Wimbledon finale 2012 between Federer v Roddick !
I did the commentary for the BBC , it was very long but few good rallies…
I would include Melbourne 2017 between Roger& Rafa , scintillating tennis 🎾 5 sets and proper comeback! https://t.co/b4c4xK0C0q

— Boris Becker (@TheBorisBecker) June 10, 2025

Becker praised this match as “scintillating tennis” featuring five sets and a “proper comeback.” The match lasted more than four hours and showcased both players' tactical skills despite their advancing ages.

The discussion about grand finals gained relevance after the recent French Open final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. The five-hour and 29-minute battle between these two players was an instant classic. Becker himself took to social media to praise this match between these two young superstars.

The Alcaraz-Sinner final is the longest French Open final and the second-longest Grand Slam final in history. The Spaniard won the match by making a comeback from being two sets down to lifting his second consecutive French Open title. This was the first time Alcaraz won a match after being two sets down. This was also the first-ever men's Grand Slam final to be contested by two players born in the 2000s.

Boris Becker's comments reflect his deep understanding of tennis, appreciating the quality of the game. As someone who played in great finals in his career, his opinions carry weight. The 2017 Australian Open final between Federer and Nadal delivered, featuring two legends producing magic late in their careers.

STUTTGART, Germany—The summer atmosphere is finally in full swing at the first stop of the German grass-court season: the BOSS OPEN. After constant rain and wind made for unpleasant conditions during the qualification weekend, Monday brought sunshine and smiles as spectators swapped umbrellas and raincoats for sunglasses and t-shirts.Zverev receives a fitting welcomeThe weather wasn't the only thing to excite the spectators on Monday. When Germany's number one Alexander Zverev arrived at the Weissenhof in the afternoon, it was impossible to see the 6'6"" star, such was the throng of fans around him as he walked from his car to the clubhouse. Dozens of children, equipped with XXL tennis balls and pens, shouted his name, hoping to get close to the world No. 3 for an autograph. After Zverev disappeared into the clubhouse, the fans remained hopeful outside the door, waiting for their star to emerge.

Zverev's fans in Germany are countless and committed, even after his quarterfinal exit at Roland Garros. Although the Hamburg native is still disappointed about the result—and has also faced a lot of criticism from former pros, including Boris Becker and Barbara Rittner—Stuttgart continues to celebrate the 28-year-old.""The last time I was here was six years ago. The facility is still beautiful. I think the fans are also really looking forward to it. Hopefully it will be a great week,"" said Zverev ahead of his first training session.

After his five-set defeat against Novak Djokovic last Wednesday, Zverev traveled to the Balearic island of Majorca without further ado. At his press conference following his elimination in Paris, he announced that he wanted to switch off by playing golf, and would not be playing tennis for the time being.""I flew straight from Paris to Majorca. I was there until this morning,"" he revealed on Monday in Stuttgart. Later, he added with a laugh: ""I wasn't partying. You won't see me there. I actually played 36 holes a day. I really enjoyed it.""After resting his racquet for four days, he returned to a green of a different kid, the grass courts in Stuttgart. But that wasn't the only thing on Zverev's mind. In the wake of his Roland Garros exit, both Becker and Rittner said that, from a coaching perspective, Zverev needs to change his approach if he wants to win his first Grand Slam title.

""When things are going well for me, I always do everything right. When things are going badly for me, everyone else is very, very clever. Unfortunately, Boris is one of them, and so is Barbara Rittner,"" Zverev replied when asked about the comments.""I don't know why she [Rittner] suddenly has so much to say about my tennis career. To be honest, I don't take her opinion seriously. Firstly, because of that, and secondly, because I think she's wrong,"" he continued.I came back to No. 2 in the world after an injury and played two Grand Slam finals in the last twelve months. I still see myself as a contender against the two guys at the top.""I lost to Djokovic. Maybe it wasn't my best match, but I thought he played very well. [...] It was just difficult. And to be honest, I talked to Boris a lot, had a lot of contact with him before he made those statements. Before this crew had all that to say, I had a great relationship with him. I don't know why it all has to be like this now.""

Zverev also emphasized: ""I lost to Djokovic. Not to Hans-Peter, who is ranked 250th in the world. Sure, it's bitter for me. I really wanted to win the French Open and go far. But it happened the way it did, and we'll keep looking at how we can improve my game.""Zverev remained composed when asked about other issues, such as his father and brother putting pressure on him.""It's interesting that suddenly everyone knows everything better than I do.I have no idea where all this information is coming from that is now suddenly on the table. It's not coming from me. And I don't think it's coming from my entourage either.

What Zverev longs for at this moment: ""I wish that the two of them [Becker and Rittner] were sitting here instead of me, holding the press conference and answering your questions. Because these statements are not coming from me.""But in fact Becker will be at the BOSS OPEN on Tuesday to record the latest episode of his podcast with Andrea Petkovic. Despite all the statements that have been made, Zverev is respectful and conciliatory about a possible meeting with the six-time Grand Slam champion.""I will always talk to him if he wants to talk to me. In every relationship, whether it's with a partner or someone else, there are issues to argue about. This is perhaps one of ours at the moment. [...]I still have enormous respect for him. He is an absolute legend, not only in sport, but in Germany in general, and also worldwide. I will always listen to what he has to say. But I don't always have to agree with him.

The tough defeat in Paris did have one small advantage, as it means that the German is able to compete in Stuttgart for the first time in six years. Zverev will face either wild card Fabio Fognini or Frenchman Corentin Moutet on Thursday.""Physically, it's difficult to play here. You don't really have any preparation time and the risk of injury is a bit higher on grass if you're not 100 percent fresh,"" he said. ""But this is a tournament I really like, and I'm very happy to be back.""But he didn't just travel to Stuttgart to warm up for Wimbledon. He has bigger plans:""When I'm here, I want to give everything to get far and win.""

Lewis Hamilton has played down any suggestions of tension between himself and his race engineer Riccardo Adami, with the Ferrari driver stating that the speculation is “just noise” which “doesn't make any difference to the job that we're trying to do”.

During the Miami Grand Prix in May, Hamilton was heard to voice his frustration as the team decided whether to order a swap between him and team mate Charles Leclerc up ahead, leading to the seven-time World Champion sarcastically commenting: “Have a tea break while you're at it.”

His relationship with Adami came under further scrutiny a few weeks later in Monaco, where Hamilton asked, “Are you upset with me or something?” over the radio during the latter stages, to which he seemingly received no response.

When quizzed during the Spanish Grand Prix weekend – his ninth event as a Ferrari driver – on how he is getting on with Adami, Hamilton insisted that there are no issues.

“Our relationship is great,” he explained. “No problems. We're constantly learning more and more about each other, we're constantly adapting to the way both of us like to work.

“He's worked with lots of different drivers before. We don't have any problems at all.”

The Briton was then pushed on whether the speculation upset him, to which he responded: “There's a lot of speculation. I mean, most of it's BS. Ultimately, we have a great relationship.

Hamilton says that he and race engineer Adami are ""constantly adapting to the way both of us like to work""

“He's been amazing to work with, he's a great guy, working so hard – we both are – and we don't always get it right every weekend. We have disagreements, like everyone does in relationships, but we work through them.

“We're both in it together, we both want to win a championship together, we're both working towards lifting the team up.

“So it's just all noise, and we don't really pay any attention to it. So it can continue if you want, but it doesn't make any difference to the job that we're trying to do.”

In reference to that message in Monte Carlo, Hamilton added: “It was literally just there [were] areas that were… we just had radio problems through the race, [and I] didn't get all the information that I wanted.”

The “Pleasure Shop” singer, a member of legendary boy group SHINee, wants to show younger K-pop artists they can have a lengthy career: “A lot of good things happened to my own career that I couldn't imagine. And everything happened after [I was] 30 years old.” 


							By 

	Nicole Fell



K-pop star Key is never one to sit idle. 


	The 33-year-old, a member of the iconic boy group SHINee, finds himself performing as a group member, creating as a solo artist, starring in multiple reality TV shows and still finding time to have moments to himself. 




	“I think every person has their own 12 identities or something,” the singer jokes to The Hollywood Reporter backstage at his music agency SM Entertainment's SMTown Live L.A. He goes on to explain that every person takes on a different identity in a different situation, and that's how he's been able to tackle his many roles as a household name in Korea.

	Below, the K-pop star gets honest about growing older in the industry, what kind of music he's looking to create next and what he's most excited about when visiting L.A. this summer for KCON. 




			Related Video		







How does it feel to be back in L.A. after some time? You said, as SHINee, you haven't been here in 10 years.


	I [completed my] military service and [there was] also [the] pandemic. After that, Taemin went to [his] military service, so timing was so, so bad for SHINee. But I've always missed [our] American fans, and of course, I always miss L.A. But you know what? Two days ago I felt – I don't know why – but something's changed a lot. I know it's [been] like six years, but it changed a lot. [It's the] same, but different. At first, I thought, ‘Oh God, I have to visit more.' When I saw the fans with my own eyes today, It was heartwarming. [I felt] love, and I felt sorry too, actually.

	











Did you?


	Yeah, a lot.


Are you hoping to get more opportunities to come here?


	Yeah. As solo artist or as SHINee as many as if it's possible, I really want to come. Actually, I'm not sure, but I'm in the planning stages for my American tour. I'm not sure [yet], but I want to. As SHINee, I want to come here often, too.


In the last six years, K-pop has become increasingly more popular in the U.S. There's just more of a demand for artists to come perform here than there was six to 10 years ago. Have you noticed a difference in that atmosphere?


	K-Pop started [gaining popularity in the U.S.] 15 or 16 years ago. I think. I thought it was kind of sort of a syndrome or something, like anime music. Like a few really dedicated fans. I'm a nerd too. I thought it was kind of like that kind of phase. But five to six years ago, K-pop was popular. And, now, what's K-pop and what's American pop? What does it mean? People dance to [a] Vietnamese song on TikTok… It doesn't matter [to] this generation. I'm singing in Korean, singing in Japanese, singing in English, it doesn't matter now. I'm kind of glad, actually


That must be more freeing to you as an artist.


	In the past if you couldn't understand the lyrics, people didn't listen, you know what I mean? But these days, [it's] totally different. I think it changed a lot. It depends on [the] artist's expression, singing English or singing Korean, it's freeing. I feel more free even now than before as an artist.

	











How do you feel you've changed as an artist? You've had a long career, and you're at a very different place than when you started. Naturally, you've grown into adulthood, but I'm wondering if even over the last few years since you were discharged from the military, if you've noticed a change in how you perform?


	Let me be honest, when I was NCT's age, I didn't know I could work at this age [33]. I couldn't imagine it, honestly. People said that a lot. All the senior artists said it's not that long [and] lasting [in a] group is really hard. I heard those kind of things a lot in the past, but now I'm 34 [Korean age] and I'm still doing the same thing. When I was a teenager, I thought when I turned 30 years old, I really thought – what should I do for my chapter? But now it's different. That kind of generation has changed, and I want to show to my junior artists, you guys can do this too [into your 30s], the same [way] you did before. A lot of good things happened to my own career that I couldn't imagine. And everything happened after [I was] 30 years old. I couldn't imagine seriously, and I didn't plan this. I did what I could do sincerely. That was my job, that [I did] with my heart. I didn't quit. That's the point. Then I thought, yeah, maybe 10 years later I'll be doing the same thing, so now I can plan it. That's the biggest thing that's changed in my life.


You're playing KCON L.A. this summer. How are you feeling about that?


	I feel really good that I made a promise to all my U.S. fans. I feel like I'm listening to their wishes. I feel really happy. I'm coming back really soon. It feels like I'm proving something to my fans that I told you, and I'm so excited. Actually this time we were in Mexico [right before], and we came here straight from Mexico, so I couldn't enjoy Los Angeles. I couldn't go out. I couldn't enjoy that much, but performing is enough for me, actually.

	











	With KCON, I'm pretty sure I want to enjoy more. It's a one day performance, so before the performance, after the performance, I want enjoy more. I want take more pictures. I want to show everyone [my trip].


Pleasure Shop was your last release. It still very much feels like a Key song, but it's a little different from some of your past releases. Where do you feel you're at sonically as a solo artist? Are you at a point where you want to try new things?


	I think one of the good things of K-pop, there's no genre. As a human… I'm such a weird person [laughs]. I'm movie nerd. In K-pop, you can mix everything, all the cultures, all the genres and all the videos into one album. I'm not saying I'm that talented. I'm not saying I'm capable of everything. But even I don't know what I want to do next. I think it depends on that year's whole environment and vibes and trends. I can pick some ideas from my past. Maybe it'll happen like that. But this year, as a human Kibum [his given name], Pleasure Shop was kind of mild for me. I want to do something stronger. I miss Gasoline so much, so I'm going to bring that again on an album in plan this year.


You said your music is just one part of you. How do you feel you differentiate these parts of your life?


	I think every person has their own 12 identities or something. Each person, not even just celebrities. If you are a human, when you go to work, when you are in school, when you meet your best friend or when you meet a friend who you don't like, it's like you become a totally different human. You know what I mean? As an artist, and as a human, it's the same. When I'm in a bad mood, I can be a bad kid. It happens because I'm a human too. In some way, maybe you won't believe this, but I'm kind of shy. I can be shy at some point and hard, and difficult. You can't just express one identity. When I go on a variety show, I think I'm Conan O'Brien. I really feel like that – I'm a comedian. When I'm on stage. I'm a pop star. I'm a Michael [Jackson] on stage. I feel like that. When I'm in a magazine. I feel like I'm a model. when I'm private. It's almost the same in private too. It's like that. There's no more, who am I? What kind of artist is Key? I don't do that. There's a lot of me.

The news arrives as the Tennessee music festival is set to kick off its 2025 edition Thursday.


							By 

	Roy Trakin



	Jonathan Mayers, a concert promoter who co-founded the music festivals Bonnaroo and helped create Outside Lands as a principal at Superfly Entertainment, has died. He was 51. The cause of death is as yet unknown.


	The news arrives as the three-day Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival is set to kick off Thursday with headliner Luke Combs. 




	The New York City native founded Superfly Presents as a marketing and event company in 1996 with partners Kerry Black, Rick Farman and Richard Goodstone, co-creating events such as the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival with Another Planet Entertainment and Bonnaroo, held since 2002 on a 700-acre farm in Manchester, Tennessee.

	Mayers' first job was working with New Orleans' legendary Tipitina's and the city's Jazz Fest. Superfly then went on to stage its first concert with the Meters, Maceo Parker and Rebirth Brass Band during Mardi Gras.


	Mayers partnered with AC Entertainment's Ashley Caps, Paradigm agent Chip Hooper and Red Light manager Coran Capshaw to launch Bonnaroo. Featuring headliners like Phish's Trey Anastasio and members of the Grateful Dead and annually drawing crowds of more than 70,000, it has become the model for the modern music festival.


	Superfly launched Vegoose festival in Las Vegas in 2005, then partnered with Another Planet to launch Outside Lands in San Francisco's fabled Golden Gate Park. In 2017, Mayers partnered with Viacom and Comedy Central to produce a comedy festival dubbed Clusterfest, which included the likes of Kevin Hart, Amy Schumer, Jon Stewart and Trevor Noah.

	











	Mayers' innovative promotion approach included re-creating sets from iconic TV shows like Seinfeld, The Office and The Daily Show offering immersive fan experiences, including a Friends pop-up of one of its sets in New York, Boston and Atlanta.


	Mayers left Superfly in August 2021 and sued his ex-partners in early 2022, accusing them of breach of contract and fraud for underestimating the value of his ownership in the company. The lawsuit was dismissed in January 2023.


	Since leaving Superfly, Mayers worked on Core City Detroit, a project which sought funds to invest in the inner city, creating a music campus with entertainment experiences for the public.


	His longtime friend, Dayglo Presents and Brooklyn Bowl founder Peter Shapiro, told The Hollywood Reporter: “People use the word visionary a lot in our business, but Jonathan Mayers was the real deal when it came to imagining what something new could be. It takes courage to lean into doing something that could crash and fail. And that is how Jonathan Mayers broke down real barriers and created some next level music festivals that impacted a generation of fans, bands and promoters.”


	Another Planet Entertainment issued a statement describing Mayers as “a bright light, always pushing new and creative ideas in the entertainment space. Everyone in the Another Planet family will miss him dearly.”

	In a new interview with Metal Hammer, Osbourne explained that the removal followed a contentious dispute with the band's manager, leading her to feel “the worst way I've felt in years.”

	“I had a huge, huge to-do with a manager over this celebration for Ozzy and Sabbath,” Osbourne explained. “And it was probably the worst way I've felt in years. And I don't care what this person says about me, thinks about it, because he doesn't know me. And he's now going around making up bulls— lies because I threw his band off the bill.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	While speculation initially arose that the band in question was Iron Maiden after she clashed with Bruce Dickinson during the 2005 edition of Ozzfest, Osbourne swiftly dismissed this.


	“Oh god, no. Ozzy only has respect for the guys in Maiden,” she said, clarifying that Ozzy was unaware of Dickinson's behavior until after the incident. “I never told him, until the night that it happened when it was the last show, and he just looked at me and goes, ‘You're terrible.'”


	Speculation also briefly pointed toward Tool due to their name initially missing from promotional materials for the event's global livestream. However, it was later confirmed that the omission was merely a design oversight, and Tool is still set to perform.

	











	Osbourne emphasized her indifference to industry criticism, noting, “I don't care what people say. Because do you know what? I don't love them. I care about people who love me, what they say about me. You can't care what an industry says, because you don't love them, so how can it hurt you? It doesn't.”


	The Back to the Beginning concert is set to be an iconic moment in rock history, featuring the final live performances from both Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne. 


	In May, Ozzy spoke to Billy Morrison on their SiriusXM “Ozzy Speaks” show to break down what he's doing to gear up for the July 5 Back to the Beginning show in his hometown.


	“I haven't done any physical work for the last seven, six and a half, seven years,” Ozzy said, promising that “by hook or by crook, I'm gonna make it [to the stage at Villa Park],” where Black Sabbath's final gig will find them joined by an all-star roster that will also include Metallica, Mastodon, Anthrax, Pantera, Alice in Chains, Gojira, Slayer and a supergroup featuring members of Guns N' Roses, the Smashing Pumpkins, Limp Bizkit, Judas Priest, Rage Against the Machine and many more.


	“I've got this trainer guy who helps people get back to normal,” he said of the intense training he's undergoing following a rough several years that included spinal surgery and a Parkinson's disease diagnosis. “It's hard going, but he's convinced that he can pull it off for me. I'm giving it everything I've got.”

	The long-awaited BTS reunion is getting closer to happening, with two more members of the South Korean group completing their mandatory military service.


	On Tuesday (June 10), it was reported that BTS members RM and V were discharged from the South Korean military after completing their required service. The pair's discharge was welcomed by hundreds of their fans (known as members of BTS' ARMY fandom) who had gathered in Chuncheon City to greet the two musicians.

	BTS pressed pause on their work as a group in 2023 in order for its members to fulfill their duties as South Korean men between the ages of 18 and 35 and serve a total of 18 months in the South Korean military. 

	











	Jin and J-Hope were discharged from their service in June and October of 2024, respectively, while Jimin and JungKook are scheduled to be discharged on Wednesday (June 11). Suga was assigned alternative service, and has been operating as a social worker since his service began. His discharge is expected to occur later this month.


	While all members of BTS have released solo projects in the interim, the approaching end of their collective military service has been eagerly anticipated by fans, who are looking forward to the band announcing their official reunion plans.


	“I look forward to June when our members will have completed their service,” J-Hope told Apple Music 1's Zane Lowe last month. “We will quickly get together and talk about what BTS can do in the future. I think it's going to be a massive energy.” 


	“When we're all back together as a group, it's going to have a huge impact, and everybody's going to be watching,” J-Hope also said to Weverse Magazine in December. “I'm excited to see what it'll feel like when we perform together again. I want to come back in style and say, ‘This is us. This is BTS.' I can't speak for everyone, but I can tell you the other members feel the same way.”

The festival pioneer was also a creative force behind Outside Lands and Clusterfest.

	Dave Brooks



Jonathan Mayers, co-founder of Superfly Entertainment and the co-creator of iconic festivals including Bonnaroo and Outside Lands, has died. His age and cause of death are unknown at this time.


“This is incredibly tough news for so many of us,” Red Light Management founder Coran Capshaw told Billboard. “Jon was the creative force behind so much of what people experience at Bonnaroo, Outside Lands, and many other events over the years. We're all really going to miss him.”


	Mayers grew up an hour outside New York City and attended Tulane University in New Orleans, graduating in 1995. He was first introduced to the music business through his work with famed New Orleans venue Tipitina's and the long-running Jazz Fest celebration. He co-founded promotion company Superfly in 1996 with Rick Farman, Richard Goodstone and Kerry Black and staged its first concert during Mardi Gras with the Meters, Maceo Parker and Rebirth Brass Band. In 2002, the four men launched and sold out the first Bonnaroo after discovering the perfect festival site an hour outside of Nashville in Manchester, Tenn. Partnering with promoter Ashley Capps of AC Entertainment, agent Chip Hooper of Paradigm and manager Coran Capshaw of Red Light — and securing headliners like Trey Anastasio from Phish and Grateful Dead's Phil Lesh and Bob Weir — the men created a 70,000-person festival that would become the blueprint for hundreds of other music festivals across the country.

	In 2005, Mayers' Superfly launched Vegoose in Las Vegas with programming at multiplevenues throughout the city. The first festival brought in approximately 37,000 visitors, and Mayers and his team ran the festival for three seasons before opting to shut it down. Mayers would also partner with Another Planet Entertainment in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2008 to launch Outside Lands in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. In 2017, Mayers led efforts to partner with Viacom and Comedy Central to produce a large-scale indoor/outdoor comedy festival in San Francisco called Clusterfest that included performances by Kevin Hart, Amy Schumer, Jon Stewart and Trevor Noah.


	While working on Clusterfest, Mayers began interfacing with major film and TV rights holders and created a new experience concept allowing fans to “step inside” some of their favorite TV shows on recreated TV sets. Mayers and team licensed rights from shows like Seinfeld, The Office, South Park, Arrested Development, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and The Daily Show to create immersive fan experiences visited by hundreds of thousands of fans. For the show Friends, Mayers led efforts to create pop-up experiences in multiple cities, including New York, Boston and Atlanta.


	Despite his success, Mayers' relationships with his co-founders at Superfly began deteriorating during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in August 2021, he was terminated from his position at the company. In early 2022, Mayers sued Farman, Goodstone and Black and accused them of civil misrepresentation, breach of contract and fraud for allegedly lowballing him for the value of his shares in Superfly. Also named in the complaint was Virgo Investment Group, a California private equity fund; Mayers alleged that its top executive, Jesse Watson, strung him along for months, promising $5 million in financing before firing him last summer. On Jan. 20, 2023, a New York judge dismissed the lawsuit.


	Mayers former partners at Superfly released a statement today to Billboard, writing “We are heartbroken with the passing of Jonathan.  He was a cherished part of Superfly's story, woven into it's history and legacy.  In addition to the role he's played in bringing joy to millions, we will miss his razor sharp wit, infectious smile and contagious laugh.  No one could light up a room like Jon.”


	After leaving Superfly, Mayers began work on a new project called Core City Detroit which sought to raise money to invest in a “culturally rich neighborhood anchored by a music campus providing world- class services, infrastructure, and housing for local/national artists & industry along with entertainment experiences for the public,” according to an investment deck on the project. Phase 1 of the Core City Detroit project included a drive-in diner by celebrity chef Kiki Louya and the renovation of an old pickle factory into a music production complex.


	Mayers' longtime friend Peter Shapiro, founder of Dayglo Presents and the Brooklyn Bowl, described him as a creative mastermind who had a deep love for live music and a vision for how it would evolve over the next two decades.


	“Jonathan was one of the true real visionaries of the modern concert world and one of the core minds behind Bonnaroo,” Shapiro tells Billboard. “Modern-day festivals are all in some way built off of his vision.”


	Company officials at Another Planet Entertainment issued a statement to Billboard following Mayers' passing. “Jonathan was a bright light, always pushing new and creative ideas in the entertainment space,” they said. “He was a visionary who was integral in the founding and the spirit of Outside Lands. Everyone in the Another Planet family will miss him dearly.”

Foxx received the Ultimate Icon Award, with tribute performances from Jennifer Hudson, Babyface, Ludacris, T-Pain, Doug E. Fresh & Tank.

Stevie Wonder surprised everyone at the 2025 BET Awards when he stepped out to honor his longtime friend Jamie Foxx.


	During the 2025 BET Awards on Monday (June 9), Jamie Foxx was set to be honored with the Ultimate Icon Award. Throughout the night, it was teased that a “special guest” would appear onstage to give Foxx his award. That guest was none other than Stevie Wonder.


	Babyface and Ludacris also popped out to pay tribute to the artistic titan, performing a cover of “Unpredictable” — the Billboard Hot 100 top 10 title track from Foxx's 2005 album — while Tank tackled a cover of Ray Charles' “Night Time is the Right Time.” Foxx famously portrayed Charles in the 2004 film Ray, for which he won the best actor Oscar. Jennifer Hudson then took the helm and bodied a soulful cover of “Gold Digger,” a 10-week Hot 100 No. 1 for Ye (formerly Kanye West) and Foxx back in 2005. T-Pain and Doug E. Fresh then popped out to close out the celebration with a rockin' cover of the 2009 No. 2 Hot 100 hit “Blame It.” Through it all, Foxx could be seen laughing, nodding along and having a great time.


	“Jamie, look at me!” Stevie joked at the end of the show before inviting Jamie to speak. “I remember seeing you the first time at a club, playing piano and singing, but I knew from the moment I heard you sing that you had so much more. I admire and celebrate your talent and your love — for blind people. I'm very happy to be here tonight to see you honored as you so very well deserve.”

	During his acceptance speech, Foxx thanked all his friends and loved ones for showing up for him while he went through life-threatening medical complications back in 2023. He added that when he saw the “In Memorium” segment, it made him reflect on his own health scare.

	











	“You can't go through something like that and not testify,” Foxx concluded to a roar of applause. “A career that I could only thank God for.”

Mark Ruffalo is set to star opposite Ruth Madeley in the Apple Original Films pic Being Heumann with CODA director Siân Heder directing. The film is an adaptation of Judy Heumann's bestselling memoir.


	The script will be written by Heder and Rebekah Taussig. David Permut (Hacksaw Ridge, Face/Off) will produce alongside Kevin Walsh (Napoleon, Manchester by the Sea), whose The Walsh Company is under an overall deal with Apple. Heumann's managers John W. Beach and Kevin Cleary of Gravity Squared Entertainment will also serve as producers, with Heumann, Being Heumann co-author Kristen Joiner, and Diana Pokorny exec producing.

Being Heumann follows Heumann as she leads over a hundred disabled people to take over the San Francisco Federal Building, kicking off a 28-day sit-in in 1977. The protestors quickly form a tightly bound community, refusing to leave until the government enforces section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which required all federal spaces to become accessible. Ruffalo will play Joseph Califano.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Heumann used a wheelchair for most of her life after contracting polio at 18 months old. She encountered discrimination early, including being denied the right to attend public school because she was considered a “fire hazard,” and was galvanized by these experiences to get involved with the fight for disability rights. In 1970, Heumann successfully sued the New York Board of Education after being denied a teaching license solely because of her disability, thereby becoming the first wheelchair user to teach in NYC public schools. Other highlights of her career include co-founding civil rights organization Disabled in Action, helping to develop and secure the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and leadership roles under both the Clinton and Obama administrations.

	











	Ruffalo can be seen next in the highly-anticipated HBO series TASK, which bows later this year. He also has the Amazon MGM Studios thriller Crime 101.


	He is repped by UTA and Lighthouse Management & Media.

Paramount Global, which last year shed 15% of its U.S. workforce, said Tuesday it will reduce it by another 3.5%.


	The cuts will take effect Tuesday, according to a memo from Co-CEOs George Cheeks, Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins that was obtained by Deadline.


	“As we navigate the continued industry-wide linear declines and dynamic macro-economic environment, while prioritizing investments in our growing streaming business, we are taking the hard, but necessary steps to further streamline our organization starting this week,” the execs wrote.

	Paramount is still in a protracted waiting game as it looks to close its $8 billion merger with Skydance Media. The transaction was proposed last summer and needs only the approval of the FCC in order to close, but it now appears unlikely to close in the first half of the year as the companies had projected. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	President Donald Trump's crusade against the media (in this case CBS News) is holding up the deal despite the fact that Paramount controlling shareholder Shari Redstone and Skydance backer Larry Ellison are longtime Trump supporters. Along with filing a $20 billion lawsuit over routine business activities at 60 Minutes, Trump's appointee to chair the FCC, Brendan Carr, has slow-walked the agency's review of the merger. While mediation talks are ongoing in the lawsuit, hopes have not recently been high for a near-term settlement.


	While the new layoffs are targeting domestic workers, the Co-CEOs said they “may also result in some impacts to our workforce outside the U.S. over time.”

	











	At the end of 2024, Paramount had 18,600 global employees, with Tuesday's cutbacks affecting several hundred in the U.S. As opposed to the multi-phase layoffs last year, which were announced in the summer and wrapped by year-end, the new round is taking effect Tuesday.


	“We recognize how difficult this is and are very thankful for everyone's hard work and contributions,” the CEOs wrote. ”These changes are necessary to address the environment we are operating in and best position Paramount for success.”


	The shrinking of Paramount's workforce reflects contraction across the entire media sector, with Disney recently announcing a fresh round of cuts as companies reckon with cord-cutting's hit to their pay-TV revenues.

International TV Co-Editor


	If he was starting out today, Dexter's Laboratory creator Genndy Tartakovsky would “make cartoon after cartoon until something hits.” 


	That was Tartakovsky's pearl of wisdom delivered to a packed Annecy audience as he celebrated 25 years of Cartoon Network Studios with a sextet of creators of some of the biggest American cartoons of all time, including The Powerpuff Girls, Adventure Time and Steven Universe.


	Tartakovsky, who is also in Annecy promoting Netflix's Fixed, figures it's easier than ever to get your big break because young cartoonists can flood YouTube with ideas.

	“It's partly independent now because you can make it and put it on your own kind of cable channel,” he added. “That's what I'd do [if I were starting now]. I'd work a day job and then at night I'd make cartoon after cartoon until something hits. It was more difficult when we were coming up.” 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Tartakovsky is enthused by the new landscape and said he “feels like when I was younger, I feel like that energy makes me still want to do new things.”


	He sat next to his old friend and The Powerpuff Girls creator Craig McCracken, who concurred, saying that for his spin-off of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, which he is making with Warner-owned Hanna Barbera Studios Europe, “the energy is so Cartoon Network” on set. 


	Adam Muto, showrunner of Adventure Time, was slightly more muted on the current state of things.


	“We need to make sure people with idiosyncrasies get to have their own voices,” he said. “But [commissioners] have to greenlight stuff. They have gotta greenlight.”


“We were breaking the system”


	Tartakovsky and McCracken walked the Annecy audience through how they broke the system at Cartoon Network Studios a quarter century ago when they were first starting out, with Tartakovsky describing the older generation of cartoonists back then as being “beaten down” when he landed his Dexter's Laboratory greenlight as a young man.


	McCracken, who worked with Tartakosvky on Dexter's Laboratory, added: “We were breaking the system and they didn't like that. They were survivalists and we had been given an opportunity they had been working their whole lives for. I felt a bit bad for them but we were given this golden opportunity, this one seven-minute show. And to be fair some of the old guard loved what we were doing.” 

	











	Tartakosvky set the scene for the early days of Dexter's Lab, which went on to achieve the rare feat of being a primetime Emmy-nominated cartoon. “Half the crew were high,” he joked. “I felt like I was saying, ‘Guys come on this is our one shot,' and then they wouldn't start working till 2 p.m.”


	He said he was “so worried about getting fired” that he “didn't have a minute to focus on anything apart from what I was doing.” 


	Soon after, McCracken's Powerpuff Girls landed a greenlight, making him into a star of the animation world, but this wasn't plain sailing either. McCracken spoke of experiencing the worst focus group of his life with a group of 11-year-old boys, one of whom even called for the “creator to be fired.” At the time, Cartoon Network executive Mike Lazzo convinced McCracken that it was better to have people hate the show than be indifferent, and he was told to push ahead.


	“I had to get out of my own head and tell myself to stop being so arty,” said McCracken. “We felt we could make cartoons at the time so we said let's make this the best thing it can be.”


	The pair were joined on stage by four younger cartoon creators including Muto, Regular Show's JG Quintel, Steven Universe creator Rebecca Sugar and Adventure Time‘s Pendleton Ward.


	This quartet, who were termed the “second generation” of Cartoon Network voices, had an intriguing discussion around fear of failure.


	“The first season we thought we'd get canned every moment,” said Muto. “It was during a transitional moment [for Cartoon Network] and our shows had to be hits.”


	Quintel said creatives live in fear at the start of their journeys that “if these are bad, then we're getting in trouble.” 


	For Sugar, who is the first non-binary person to independently create a series for the network, it was  “less about competition and more about protection” at the start of her journey.


	“I learned when showrunning that when there is something specific on a board, you have to think how to protect it,” she explained. 


	Sugar was delighted to sit on the same stage as Tartakovsky. She recalled pitching him an early version of Steven Universe. When Tartakosvky said he'd direct an ep, “I crashed my car into a pole on the way home,” Sugar added. 


	The group were speaking at Annecy on the same day as Matt Groening.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce fans are becoming more convinced that the power couple is secretly married, thanks to a tiny detail spotted in an unsuspecting photo.

On Monday, June 9, Cole Kmet and Emily Jarosz's wedding planner, Ellie Nottoli, shared details of the couple's big day on Instagram, including “love notes” for the guests.

Eagle-eyed fans quickly zeroed in on a light blue envelope addressed to Swift and Kelce, confirming the power couple was on the guest list. But what made it eyebrow-raising was the way the couple's name was written.

The envelope, featuring elegant calligraphy that read “Taylor and Travis Kelce” alongside a “Table 13” seating assignment, quickly stirred excitement among fans. Apparently, many take this as proof that the singer and NFL star are now husband and wife.

One excited fan commented on X, “Would be a welcome surprise for them! If true, hope they always share happiness together.”

Another speculated, “I think they're married in court. The real wedding will happen later.”

Someone wrote, “This feels like something we shouldn't be seeing,” while another chimed in, “Taylor Kelce, it has a lovely ring to it.”

Meanwhile, some were not convinced that Swift and Kelce are actually married now. One fan pointed out, “This is very common for couples (married and unmarried) for weddings. It's the aesthetic.”

Another shared the same sentiment, “I'm engaged, but even when we were dating, invited would be addressed to ‘<fiancés name> and <fiancé's last name>'. It's not that weird. It's solely for aesthetic purposes.”

Swift and Kelce skipped Kmet and Jarosz's wedding, but they did step out for another nuptials on Friday, June 6, per People. The couple attended Kelce's cousin Tanner Corum's wedding in Tennessee. 

Whether or not the rumors of a secret marriage are true, Swift and Kelce's relationship is stronger than ever. According to Daily Mail, everyone is just waiting for the two to take their relationship to the next level.

A source told the outlet that Swift's parents are ready to give their blessing to Kelce when he asks for her hand in marriage.

“Nothing seems to be imminent, but it will 100 percent happen,” the insider added. “Taylor and Travis are treating this relationship as their last relationship, and when they get engaged, when they get married and when they start a family, it will be exactly when it is meant to happen.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Keanu Reeves Has Perfect Reaction to Jonathan Groff Straddling Him at Tony Awards","https://entertainmentnow.com/broadway-news/jonathan-groff-straddles-keanu-reeves-tonys/","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 01:09:26 GMT","

The crowd watched Jonathan Groff intently as he launched into the songs “Mack the Knife,” “That's All,” and “Once in a Lifetime” at the 2025 Tony Awards. But he really grabbed everyone's attention when he came into the crowd and jumped onto Keanu Reeves' chair. The “John Wick” actor stared up in mock horror as he became a part of the show.

Reeves could've had many reactions to his former co-star bringing him into the spotlight. His decision to fully embrace the moment just made us love him even more.

Groff jumped off the stage and quickly spotted Reeves. He jumped onto Reeves' chair, straddling him, singing “and the only heart I own is for you and you alone.” 

“I can only give you country walks in springtime, and a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,” he continued. He caressed Reeves' hair and chest while Reeves looked up at him, displaying an exaggerated look of surprise. But as the camera zoomed in, Reeves looked thrilled, making devil horns — the rock n' roll symbol, with both hands.

Groff was nominated in the Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical category for his role as Bobby Darin in “Just in Time.” He previously told Vogue that he wanted to “break the fourth wall with the audience to create that connection that Bobby was really famous for.” He created that connection at the 2025 Tony Awards.

Reeves and Groff aren't strangers; the two co-starred in “The Matrix Resurrections.” Groff played a version of Agent Smith, previously played by Hugo Weaving.

The “Frozen” actor earned the nickname “The Savage” on set because he gave his all to the fight scenes. He admitted to GQ that he was determined to perfect one particular fight sequence. Groff trained more for “The Matrix” than he had for any of his Broadway shows. He wanted to ensure he “could actually be present with one of the greatest action stars of our generation.”

Groff told The Hollywood Reporter that working with Reeves was “an experience I'll hold in my heart for the rest of my life.” 

“It was so exciting to be doing such extraordinary fight choreography with the greatest action star of our time and someone that's so devoted to their craft,” he said. “I really tried to take in every single moment of getting to be with Keanu and I learned so much from working with him.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘American Idol' Finalists Rally Around Josh King Amid Hospitalization","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/what-happened-josh-king-hospitalized/?adt_ei=[email]","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 13:31:00 GMT","

As North Carolina musician Josh King advanced all the way to the top eight on season 23 of “American Idol,” he bravely admitted how scared he was to lose the friendships he'd forged with his fellow finalists once the show was over. But on June 9, 2025, King revealed that those friends were still there for him as he spent several days in the hospital. 

King, 23, posted a photo of himself in his hospital bed flanked by two friends from “American Idol” — Skylie Marie Thompson, who made it to the Hollywood Week Showstopper round, and top 24 singer Grayson Torrence. They were part of a songwriting retreat that King had traveled to Virginia to be part of, hosted by another Hollywood Week contestant, Nina Daig, he wrote on Instagram. 

Although the weekend started well, King woke up one morning in “excruciating pain,” barely able to move, and wound up in the hospital for several days. Doctors diagnosed the singer and piano player with a potentially life-threatening condition, but King said he's on the mend and grateful for his “American Idol” family, near and far, who rallied around him. 

A post shared by Josh King (@officialjoshking)

After the first two days of the songwriting retreat held at Daig's house, King wrote that, after feeeling a little “iffy,” he “went to sleep and woke up the next morning entirely unable to move. I was in such excruciating pain that I evacuated anything that remained in my stomach 😀” 

Daig's husband took King to the hospital, where they found his resting heart rate was high, a “steady 125-130 bpm for most of Saturday,” he wrote, “and any ounce of movement hurt like hell.” 

“I don't quite know what it was exactly,” King shared, adding that the doctors diagnosed him with SIRS, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which the Cleveland Clinic describes as “a life-threatening medical emergency caused by your body's overwhelming response to a stressor” which can include an “infection, trauma or a worsening health condition.” 

“The doctor said there was a ton of strain on my heart as a result,” King wrote, “and I had to be monitored for the next two nights. The cause was a combination of things, dehydration, fatigue, stress, heat exhaustion, etc.” 

King said he was released from the hospital on June 9 was “on the mend” but that he'd been “severely unlucky regarding the state of my health” in recent weeks. 

King, who performed on the “American Idol” season finale with Jessica Simpson, concluded his post by writing, “Idol family was there for me once again when I needed them :)”

Torrence posted a selfie video on the night of June 9 to tell fans, “Josh is doing a lot better, he's out of the hospital,” but that he would be staying in Virginia for several days and they'd be able to work on songs as he recovers. She encouraged fans to leave kind words and prayers for him in the comment section of his post.  

Among those who've already commented are some of his fellow “American Idol” finalists, including third-place finisher Breanna Nix, who wrote, “oh no! I'm happy you're out!! Please rest though!!!”

Canaan James Hill, who was attending the BET Awards, wrote, “Glad to hear you're okay brother! Love you man 🤝🏾💯”

Ché Chesterman chimed in, “Wish you well brother ❤️” and Desmond Roberts wrote, “So glad you're alive man🙏🏾❤️”

During his “American Idol” journey, King was heralded for encouraging the “American Idol” judges to save 16-year-old Mattie Pruitt instead of him, advancing her into the top 7. Host Ryan Seacrest also revealed that King has volunteered every week for the last several years with young patients at Seacrest Studios inside Charlotte's Levine Children's Hospital.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","HGTV's Christina Haack Shares Relief Over Latest Bloodwork Results","https://entertainmentnow.com/hgtv/christina-haack-health-testing-doctor-bloodwork/","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 15:26:24 GMT","

After facing multiple health challenges in recent years, longtime HGTV star Christina Haack is celebrating her latest lab results. 

“Today I found out my bloodwork is the best it's ever been,” Haack wrote in an update via her Instagram Stories on June 9, 2025, noting that she started seeing a “regenerative health practitioner” in 2018. 

Haack continued with her update, written in white text on a black background, “All my inflammation & autoimmune numbers are great. This just shows how much stress can truly negatively affect your health. 🙏❤️😥”

Haack's results are a huge relief after several years of nerve-wracking health challenges and the stress of her third marriage ending in July 2024.

In early 2023, the “Christina on the Coast” star shared that she underwent “extensive” testing to try to figure out why she'd been feeling so under the weather. 

She shared in her Instagram Stories that January, “I did an expensive, super extensive panel and I got all my results back for, like, 100 different types of molds and metals and bacterias. And my highest level of toxicity came back as an abnormal amount of gut bacteria, which is like SIBO, and also parasites.” 

According to the Mayo Clinic, SIBO stands for Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth, which is the result of “an abnormal increase in the overall bacterial population in the small intestine — particularly types of bacteria not commonly found in that part of the digestive tract.”

Haack shared a page of her test results at the time, which were ordered by her doctor at Lee Regenerative Medical Institute, an alternative medicine practice in Huntington Beach, California. Rather than opt for traditional remedies, such as antibiotics or surgery, the HGTV star took a holistic route,  including a “detox” regimen. 

“So I'm on a cleanse and a parasite cleanse and I heard it gets worse before it gets better,” she said in a video she posted to her Stories. “It's pretty brutal, but I'm hoping at the end, I feel good.”

Haack told People in 2020 that she'd been diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune disorder that can cause hypothyroidism, and that paying close attention to her nutrition had helped some. But in 2021, she shared on Instagram that her “extreme stomach pain” had continued.   

“It has been written off as stress and doctors have tried to put me on all the pills / meds but luckily I realized masking it wasn't the answer,” she wrote at the time. “I wanted to fix the problem so I really focused on my nutrition and it seemed to get better but then last year it was triggered again and all of a sudden the stomach pain was back.”

Haack's health challenges continued into the next year. In April 2024, Haack shared that she'd made a “pretty disturbing” discovery about a root canal she'd had several years earlier, revealing in her Instagram Stories that she was going to have oral surgery for a lingering infection. 

“When I was 16, I had a tooth injury to a back molar and had to have an emergency root canal,” Haack wrote in her Stories. “In 2020, my dentist saw via xray the previous root canal showed signs of being infected. So I went and had it redone.”

“Fast forward to last week,” she continued. “The infection came back…so I've had an infection that I have zero symptoms of lingering for years and years!! Pretty disturbing.”

“I'm taking care of it next week via explant,” Haack told her fans, “but leaving an infection that long can cause all kinds of health complications. With no root you can't feel there is a problem.”

According to the American Association of Endodonists, it's rare but possible for root canals to become infected again. In most situations, per the AAE, patients undergo a “complex” endodontic retreatment procedure to remove infection and save the tooth.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Balance Is Why Chrishell Stause and G Flip's Relationship Works","https://entertainmentnow.com/reality-tv/selling-sunset-chrishell-stause-gflip-adoption/","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 11:58:51 GMT","

Even if you're a reality television star, not everything needs to be blasted out to the world. At least that is what “Selling Sunset” star Chrishell Stause has learned.  After very public heartbreaks and splits from Justin Hartley and Jason Oppenheim, she has found lasting love that she chooses to keep a little more private.

Stause met G Flip, an Australian musician, on the set of a music video, and as they say, the rest is history. After a whirlwind romance, a private wedding ceremony, and matching tattoos, according to Us Weekly, the couple is now working on starting a family. 

Right from the start, Stause and G Flip treated their relationship as if it were different. By the time they married in May 2023, privacy was one of their top priorities. “It was very untraditional. Elvis was there! So, it was great,” Stause said of the wedding, exclusively to Entertainment Tonight. 

“It just really meant a lot for us. And it was… the best day of all time,” Stause shared, adding that the privacy around the wedding was to avoid unwanted, unsolicited feedback. “I just feel like some of those things you don't want to hear people's opinions on. It was perfect. It was amazing. It was nice to kind of keep things private and to ourselves so that we could really enjoy it. Then, once we felt ready to share, now it's exciting because we get to kind of live in it all over again. So, it's nice.”

The couple also locked in their commitment with matching tattoos of their wedding vows. Chrishell is proud of her relationship and says, “I really wanted to validate our love and really feel like we let people know that this is, you know, this isn't something silly, [or that] we're just having fun. We have big plans for each other. And I think that that's something that, in the scope of the world today, it's something that I was happy to share, and it's something that I really am proud about.”

One of the things that seems to work for this couple is staying candid about their lives, without totally oversharing every detail. It is one of the things that makes Chrishell and G Flip's relationship somewhat relatable to their fans. Two years after tying the knot, they are now focused on starting a family via adoption. 

Chrishell told Us Weekly earlier this spring, “We've kept the details a little under wraps, just because I don't think it helps anybody to go into all the details. But I'll just say to anyone that understands this [adoption] process — there are just a lot of different roadblocks, and so we do feel like we're on the upswing.”

“We are feeling really positive about where we're at currently. And I will tell you this — nobody will be happier to report good news than me when it's that time. So, until then, I just really feel like everything happens for a reason.”

The Monday morning I sat down with Celine Song in New York City, where she lives and where her hotly awaited new film “Materialists” is set, came about an hour after reviews broke. Led by an appealing cast and doubling as a breezy romance and an incisive critique of modern dating, “Materialists” is her second movie as a director, and her first since “Past Lives” turned Song into the Oscar-nominated belle of the 2023-2024 awards season.

Reactions pouring in were going well, as most reviews (including IndieWire's) reacted positively to writer/director Song's portrait of matchmaker-to-the-moneyed Lucy (Dakota Johnson), who balances the clinical outlook on romance her job demands with an unexpected love triangle between herself, a lethally charming private-equity broker and potential client named Harry (Pedro Pascal), and her less-polished, struggling-actor ex John (Chris Evans). But Song, she said, doesn't read reviews. She leaves that task to her husband, “Challengers” and “Queer” screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes, to deliver the highlights.

 








Related Stories ‘The Phoenician Scheme' Production Design Stretches Even Wes Anderson's Theatricality to the Limit Studio Ghibli at 40: Can an Ethical Animation Studio Still Exist, or Even Survive? 

“We do this for each other. Just because [reading reviews] sort of distances the movie, too,” Song told IndieWire. “The thing that you made is this thing that is, in a way, totally intangible. To see it in paper adjudicated and judged, even if it's so positive and wonderful, which is true, too, still, it's turned into words where it's being evaluated. There is a bit of it where it feels sad, you know? Even if it's good. I love hearing that it's good. I love it when he reads me snippets, like, ‘OK, this is good,' but it's nothing to do [with] the movie anymore.” She laughed, “It's no longer mine!”

 










Song's latest movie takes the shape of the classic '90s rom-coms (think Nora Ephron) or rom-drams (think James L. Brooks) nobody makes for theaters anymore, but it has more on its mind, and is perhaps more cannily sociological than its predecessors. For one, Lucy lives in debt and out of her means on an $80,000 annual salary (which, a sad reality, for a single New Yorker living on their own in a studio or a one-bedroom as she does is at the low end of livable). For another, her clients, including Sophie (Zoë Winters), come to her frayed by the dating market, likely arriving at the matchmaking service Adore (run by Marin Ireland's character) after striking out once again on the apps.

Song's breakout “Past Lives” — a ruminative, what-might-have-been walk-and-talk about a married Korean-American immigrant (Greta Lee) who reconnects with her childhood best friend and potential lost flame (Teo Yoo), premiered at Sundance 2023. Ecstatic acclaim and awards ambitions from A24 suddenly flung the first-time feature filmmaker (who got her creative start in the New York theater world after moving to Canada from Korea with her family when she was 12) onto the long-haul festival and awards circuit, which demands a lot from anyone. It would be more than a year until she finally attended the 2024 Oscars, where “Past Lives” was nominated for Best Picture, but in between, she attended innumerable fests and awards ceremonies to represent her critical darling.

 










“I can imagine, in 10 years, I'll be like, ‘I can't do that!'” Song laughed. “But the first movie, I felt like I could do it, and I liked getting to know different festivals and different sides of the release internationally. How's it doing in Spain? Again, the topic was love, which I could talk about forever. It wasn't like I was talking about something difficult.”

Journalists speculated as to why A24 opted to skip festivals and take “Materialists,” which wrapped in New York in Spring 2024, directly to theaters for a wide release this summer. It's opening on June 13 in around 2,800 theaters; “Past Lives” started in four theaters with a platform release two years ago, playing eventually at most in just over 900 to gross $11 million by the end of a nine-month run. (The fizzy rom-com-centered marketing on “Materialists,” meanwhile, may turn out to be a bait-and-switch for what is a deeper drama in the end, but early social sentiment was high even before reviews.)

“They're a studio. They're the ones who tell me what they think. But they do care, more than the other studios, about [creativity] and what the filmmaker wants. When they were talking about me — ‘this is the plan' — I got really excited. I was like, really? You think? That's so cool,” Song said. “I wanted an amazing experience like that, because I had an amazing, beautiful experience releasing ‘Past Lives' … With this movie, I'm trying to do something different. Similarly, I want to have a different experience releasing the movie.”

 










As for the films and literature that inspired “Materialists” — which is so much caught up in the mathematics of love, its operations and behavior as an economically driven apparatus grounded in value, mutual exchange, and investment — it was Brooks, Ephron, even Billy Wilder. “There was a whole era where you just get to show up to a movie where people are going through things, and there's so much romance, and it's going to be about love because it's the thing we are all interested in. It's also about the way life works.”

But Jane Austen, ever the literary master of tracing how romance also is and must be a kind of business deal pivoted around a woman's life station, also spoke to Song (whose academic studies have included psychology, philosophy, and playwriting) and “Materialists.” “Victorian romances are really in touch with the material reality and the pressures of marriage, the pressures of partnering, especially for women whose only way at the time to have any power or security or prosperity was through marriage,” she said. “In 2025, women can have jobs, they can have lucrative salaries, an amazing career, but amazingly, there's still material pressures of partnership that still pervade differently.”

Women, she said, like Lucy, who is “not somebody who was born rich and feels like she has to fit into the wealthy world that allows her to do the work that she does. She's always going to live a little bit beyond her means, which is quite relatable for New Yorkers: You set a budget for rent, and then you end up paying $500 more,” Song said. Lucy, though, because of her job duties and past disappointments in love, can only at first see romance and marriage in terms of numbers, which is why when she meets Harry at a client's glitzy wedding, she grills him about his income, his height, and his background without even attempting to interrogate his essence as a person, his interests beyond the status signifiers that could make him a suitable match.

 










As “Materialists” is a love story about singles navigating New York City, of course, “Sex and the City” and its own Austenian contemplations of the metrics of dating life and how wealth and privilege play a factor in courtship, come to mind not just among the audience but for Song, too.

“The thing about ‘Sex and the City' is that now, sometimes you rewatch it, and you're like, ‘Those are some old ideas about gender!'” laughed Song, who like any romantic New Yorker or even aspiring ones raised herself artistically on the show to a degree, too. “But some of those things you realize, you grew up imagining what it is like to live in an unconventional way as a working woman. It's one of the longest-lasting [stories about] being a woman and also being a woman who is not necessarily likeable 100 percent of the time. There's some element where it was always completely relatable, and then you also fall in love with New York City through that show. You get to know everything about where you want to go. They'll be like, ‘In downtown…,' and we'll be like, ‘Ooh, downtown!' And I'll be watching from Toronto.”

“Sex and the City,” which Song praised as never “moralizing,” is about a fantasy of New York City, a fantasy of being a single person, and the kind of fantasy Song both tributes and even debunks in “Materialists.” Her film, though, takes us to parts of New York we didn't see in the HBO series or even now on its HBO Max counterpart “And Just Like That” or rarely in Manhattan love stories, like Brooklyn's Bushwick, where John stars in a new play (“Tom and Eliza,” named for Song's own 2016 prize-winning stage work), or the bayside Sunset Park, where he lives in a cramped three-bedroom with two chaotic roommates.

 










“When I scripted it in 2022, I thought he would be living in Bushwick, and then, me and my location manager realized that Bushwick has been so far gentrified that it just wouldn't make any sense,” she said. “It would be too expensive for him. I don't give a fuck about this New York real estate. But that's why we were like, what's a place that's not fully gentrified, where as an actor you have two roommates and pay that much, and are in a sweet situation and can't move and the apartment's shitty?”

Song may not give a fuck about New York real estate, but her movie is as interested in the balance sheets endemic to human romances as it is the emotions needed to sustain them at all.

“Have you become so completely wrapped up in the numbers and the algorithm and the way that we objectify and commodify ourselves that that's what we're considering more real than true love?” Song wondered, pondering her movie's true theme. “The character Sophie says, ‘I'm not merchandise. I'm a person.' What does it mean to be a person right now? Is it actually the way it seems on Instagram? ‘Materialists' is really interested in the dating market. That's the job Lucy has, that's where the cynicism is from. The dating market existed in Victorian romances — it was kind of local, the garden parties, the actual gossip. Now, the marriage market is on their phones. You can go to Instagram and compare your own value as a data point … in comparison to everyone else.”

 










She continued, “There is an endless self-commodification and self-objectification. All the language we have around self-improvement, for example. Like, ‘Everybody's getting Botox. Why don't you get Botox? Do you not want to invest in your face?' They talk about it as an investment. ‘You're going to look so much better. You're going to be improved.' There's a very insidious conversation about improving your value … at the end of the day, what you're trying to say is that you're merchandise, you're for sale, so you should improve your value, just like how you improve anything you're trying to sell. Everything comes down to Sophie's line: ‘I'm not merchandise. I'm a person.' It's fun to play the game and objectify ourselves and each other. It's catty. But the end of that is going to be dehumanization.”

“Materialists” opens in theaters from A24 on Friday, June 13.

Studio Ghibli's prestigious reputation consists of truths and exaggerations. The company has spent 40 years as a world leader in quality animation while independently funding projects based on prior successes — until their sale to Nippon TV in 2023.

Behind every great library of art is a machine that needs to sell it, and Ghibli, which turns 40 this June, is no different. As much as we laud the altruistic, ethical enterprise established by Toshio Suzuki, Isao Takahata, and Hayao Miyazaki, Ghibli can be just as cynical as its Western counterparts. 

 










Ghibli's branding as an ethical animation studio isn't unfounded. Rayna Denison, author of “Studio Ghibli: An Industrial History,” has admired the thoughtful way Suzuki, Takahata, and Miyazaki constructed the studio.

“They put deep thought into what they wanted to do with their studio before they founded it,” Denison told IndieWire. “You get early interviews with Miyazaki saying things like, ‘If you're only hiring people on temporary contracts, then they're not really your employees, so you can't expect much from them.' He makes jokes about how if he has to turn his air conditioning off to save money to pay people's salaries, he's willing to sweat through the entire summer for the sake of animation. Miyazaki came out of a left-leaning union movement in the 1960s, so I think he had started thinking about a better way to make animation. That's why Ghibli has a creche, and there are places to put your bicycle, all these little touches that are very Miyazaki.”

 










For Michael Leader, co-host of the “Ghibliotheque” podcast and co-author of “Ghibliverse” and “The Animation Atlas,” the works of Studio Ghibli rise above the conversation about animation being a kids' medium. 

“They go all the way back to the basic idea of storytelling,” Leader said. “If you think about when storytelling was just people around a campfire, it would be aimed at whoever was there. They never said, ‘This is a story for kids.' It's how they made sense of the world. But then these folk tales become fairy tales, which become bedtime stories for kids, and then they're turned into something for Disney, and suddenly it's just kids stuff. But actually, when it's done well, it's wise, it's got life lessons, it's got a worldview. Miyazaki and Takahata mostly made work for younger audiences, but it has the wisdom and worldview and craft and skill of any sort of story.”

The miracle of Miyazaki's movies is that he's able to make such thoughtful art while setting box office records. 1997's “Princess Mononoke” was the highest-grossing release of all time in Japan until “Titanic” arrived that same year. His mentor/older-brother-figure, Isao Takahata, had some successes but ultimately different goals. 

“The difference between Miyazaki and Takahata is that Takahata tried to push the envelope of what animation can do and who it is for,” said Denison. “When they released [1991's] ‘Only Yesterday,' the promotional magazines for it had interviews with adult professional women from across Japan. It was aimed squarely at women who were in their 20s and 30s. It was a really risky thing for him to do, but this is what Takahata did at Ghibli. They gave him the freedom to experiment and to push the limits of Japanese animation.”

 










Not only were Takahata's films more experimental than Miyazaki's, but he also had a less conventional way of working. “You always take [studio CEO] Suzuki's stories with a grain of salt, because he loves to tell a story,” said Leader. “But he claims that after Miyazaki made loads of money from ‘Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind,' he said to Takahata, ‘I'd like to fund you to make another film. I've been to this area of the country where there's a beautiful canal system where you could maybe set an animated film.' Takahata comes back with a three-hour documentary. It's really slow and goes way over budget, meaning Miyazaki had to make another sweeping adventure film, and that's where ‘Castle in the Sky' came from.”

Even Takahata's “Grave of the Fireflies,” widely regarded as a masterpiece, was mired by the director's approach to his work. “Takahata missed the deadline [for ‘Grave'],” said Leader. “It was released unfinished, which was professionally embarrassing. No one would fund another Takahata project because he blows budgets, misses deadlines, and delivers a film unfinished. So Miyazaki really put himself on the line to get ‘Only Yesterday' made.” 

For Leader, this hammers home the unreality of a studio without an intense marketing machine around it. “You need your films to be bought and watched, because that's how they become embedded in the culture, how they pass between generations. No animation studio in the world has that freedom to completely self-finance based on the legacy of what they've done, unless your dad owns Nike.”

 










One of the main ways Ghibli finances its work is through merchandise, an industrial complex unto itself.

“Initially, Toshio Suzuki agreed to put a cap on merchandising profits, so they weren't looking to massively exploit what was available to them,” said Denison. “But when they briefly shut the studio in 2014, they really shifted modes, and we've seen an explosion in Ghibli merchandising. It was also really important to the early life of the studio, and it allowed the studio to become a permanent enterprise. The success of Totoro and then Jiji merchandise mattered when they were trying to build their own studio in the early 1990s and have a permanent home for Studio Ghibli.”

Then, 1989 proved to be a pivotal year for the studio. “My Neighbor Totoro” first showed on TV and launched a demand for plushies, while Ghibli found their first theatrical hit in “Kiki's Delivery Service.” That's also when Ghibli began telling stories about women. “When they're promoting ‘Kiki's Delivery Service,' it's seen as another girl-focused movie, following on from ‘My Neighbor Totoro,' so they're becoming known for Shoujo animation,” said Denison. “‘Kiki' was also sold on the idea of how one overcomes depression. I find that fascinating from a relatively young studio, in what should just be a girl's adventure movie, to be dealing with psychological blocks and maturity and becoming a mature version of yourself and finding your power again as a woman.”

 










Spin is key to Ghibli's success, being able to market themselves as blockbuster filmmakers in Japan and as prestigious “world cinema” filmmakers elsewhere. The person chiefly tasked with finding a marketing spin on Hayao Miyazaki's and Takahata's work is Toshio Suzuki, a man described by Goro Miyazaki as “a dark wizard who makes me do things I don't want to.” 

As much as he's a master marketer, Suzuki is also an incredibly talented producer, constantly getting the best from his directors. “He's trying to bring these generational talents together and make them play off each other, do some behind-the-scenes wrangling and ego management to make them do something great,” said Leader.

What Suzuki most notably helped realize was Ghibli's sheen of prestige. “They became known as the anti-Disney,” said Leader. “Disney sold out years ago. They became about selling theme parks and cruises and characters in suits and Disney adults and being emblematic of American imperialism. Ghibli was seen as something of substance, something handcrafted and beautiful, which plays into orientalist tropes about Japan.”

Miyazaki being pushed to the forefront, mostly due to the way audiences respond to his movies, risks diminishing the work of everyone else at the studio. “We haven't talked about Yoshifumi Kondo, Hiromasa Yonebayashi or Goro Miyazaki, these other directors who are doing interesting works,” said Denison. “I feel so sorry for Goro Miyazaki. He's set up to fail from the very beginning by Suzuki who invites him in to do the work [for 2006's ‘Tales from Earthsea'] and then creates a narrative of discord between Goro and his father.”

 










Hayao Miyazaki's ubiquity comes with other problematic elements. “What Miyazaki means as a buzzword that can now be boiled down to an aesthetic, a vibe, or an AI filter,” said Leader. “The real person that is existing right now in Japan isn't the Miyazaki fans know. Instead, Miyazaki is the meme of him saying [of artificial intelligence animation], ‘It's an insult to life itself.' It happens with any creator. They get flattened once 1000s around the world are tattooing them onto their body. Steven Spielberg fought for many years against being the guy who makes films where a kid looks up at the sky, or the Scorsese thing where he only makes films about gangsters. Miyazaki has reached that level.”

“I feel like the boy in the Heron is very interesting,” said Denison. “A lot of people have been commenting about the fact that it's not as original as some of his other films. I think that's because it's that much more personal. This is a master animator looking back over his career, over his relationships, and what people in his life have meant to him, and building a story around that it is just that much more personal for him.”

Leader points out how Miyazaki's work has evolved since the early '90s. “The Balkan conflicts with Yugoslavia radicalized him and changed his view of the world. Then, you see that happen again in the early 2000s with the war on terror and post-911 American imperialist stuff in the Middle East. You do see his worldview change through the films. Also in his old age, his films become about him again.”

 










There have been times when the image Ghibli sells directly conflicts with its actions. “There are these women behind the scenes that you keep seeing in all these documentaries whose names are never listed, who don't get a lot of credit for the work they do,” said Denison. “That was one of the things that drew me to write the book. I wanted to think about how the studio with this stellar reputation for making feminist animated heroines relegates all these women to the backgrounds.

“In the early days of Japanese animation at places like Toei Animation, where Takahata and Miyazaki trained, women weren't allowed to train as directors. It used to be the case that women retired after they got married as an expected part of the industry. It's also the case that women have been at the bottom lines of the industry and been very exploited. The practice of working from home and being paid by the cell is something that applied more to women across the decades.”

Though Ghibli did a lot of work to improve working conditions, the studio has never promoted a woman to direct a film. “'Porco Rosso' is the only movie where women got promoted to big roles,” added Denison. “Everybody was busy working on ‘Only Yesterday,' so Miyazaki's usual team wasn't available to him, and so he looked around the studio and elevated the seven people he felt deserved elevation, and apparently they all just happened to be women.”

 










The idea of succession and promoting talent has been a stumbling block for Ghibli, putting the future of the studio beyond Takahata, Miyazaki, and Suzuki into doubt. “I don't think without the three of them, there's a reason to keep it going,” said Denison. “I don't think there's the impetus behind it, but it's also a brand name that Nippon TV [which acquired Ghibli in 2023] bought into so they could use the intellectual properties and extrapolate them and keep the theme parks going. They could import directors like Yonebayashi back in and do new films with new directors, but I don't know if I see that happening.”

Leader believes that the era of the studio actively making things is over, allowing us to look back on their unique place in the cinematic landscape. “They were able to create the sense that the studio was having this huge cultural impact, but they weren't a Disney-level operation. Also, other auteurs that we would put Miyazaki alongside, their access to their art is dictated by bigger studios. The Christopher Nolan story is whether he's working with Warner Bros. or Universal, Scorsese has to go to Netflix or Apple to get funding. Ghibli managed to do it in a way that was relatively independent and unsullied of that business. You wouldn't have Miyazaki trying to pitch a Kool-Aid movie.”

A24 has dropped the trailer for “Eddington,” Ari Aster‘s modern western that divided the Cannes Film Festival after its Croisette premiere. The film will hit theaters nationwide July 18 — and it very well may “hit” with heated debate.

The film takes place in 2020 — yes, that 2020 — in the most visceral way, with the anti-mask local sheriff (Joaquin Phoenix) of the fictional Eddington, New Mexico, facing off against the town's COVID-guideline-advocate mayor, played by Pedro Pascal (the second of his three summer releases). The heavy-hitter cast also includes Emma Stone, Austin Butler, Luke Grimes, Deirdre O'Connell, Micheal Ward, Amélie Hoeferle, Clifton Collins Jr., and William Belleau, all of whom represent various perspectives on the pandemic spectrum.

IndieWire reported last month on the film's polarizing audience response, with people truly either loving or hating the film, and few in between. The cast and crew addressed the controversial COVID epic's hot-button reactions at a Cannes press conference.

 










“It's very scary to participate in a movie that speaks to issues like this,” Pascal said. “It's far too intimidating a question for me to address. I'm not informed enough. I want people to be safe and protective. I want very much to be on the right side of history … I felt like [Aster] wrote something that was all our worst fears as that lockdown experience was already a fracturing society. This was building toward an untethered sense of reality. There is a point of not going back. I was overwhelmed by that fear, and it's wonderful that it was confirmed by Ari.”

“I wrote this movie in a state of fear and anxiety. I wanted to try and pull back and show what it feels like to live in a world where nobody can agree on what is real anymore,” Aster added at the same presser.

IndieWire's David Ehrlich wrote in his A- review that the director is “exclusively interested in making the kind of films that should be reviewed straight onto a prescription pad, is too beholden to his neuroses for his latest movie to play like a cheap provocation. This time, however, there's a good chance those are your neuroses, too.”

Prior to its release, “Eddington” will open the Fantasia International Film Festival on July 16. It will be in theaters everywhere July 18. Watch the trailer below.

Pedro Almodóvar has found his next project. The auteur is now at work on “Bitter Christmas” for Spanish streaming platform Movistar Plus+. Almodóvar also collaborated with the platform on his English-language feature debut, “The Room Next Door.”

“Bitter Christmas,” or “Amarga Navidad,” stars a slew of Almodóvar newcomers and staples, including Bárbara Lennie (“Petra”), Leonardo Sbaraglia (“Pain and Glory”), Aitana Sánchez-Gijón (“Parallel Mothers”), Victoria Luengo (“The Room Next Door”), Patrick Criado (“Riot Police”), Milena Smit (“Parallel Mothers”), and Quim Gutiérrez (“Darkbluealmostblack”). The film will be released in Spanish theaters in 2026, with Warner Bros. Pictures Spain distributing. It will then debut exclusively on the Movistar Plus+ platform.

IndieWire has reached out to Almodóvar's representatives for details about a possible U.S. release, though it can be assumed Sony Pictures Classics will release the film in North America, as it has all of Almodóvar's recent outings. We're told that festival play and a U.S. release will take place before the Movistar+ premiere.

 










“Bitter Christmas” centers on advertising director Elsa, now mourning the loss of her mother over a December holiday weekend. The official synopsis, as shared by Variety, reads: “She throws herself into work as a form of escape, not realizing she's denying herself the time to grieve. Her relentless pace is interrupted when a panic attack forces her to take a break. Her partner, Bonifacio, becomes her anchor in this moment of crisis. Elsa decides to travel to the island of Lanzarote with her friend Patricia, who is also looking to get away from Madrid, while Bonifacio stays behind in the city. The story of these three characters, and several others, runs parallel to that of screenwriter and film director Raúl Durán, intertwining fiction and reality. ‘Bitter Christmas' explores how life and fiction are inseparably linked, sometimes painfully so.”

The project is currently filming in Madrid and Lanzarote. Almodóvar and his brother, Agustín Almodóvar, produce through their El Deseo banner in collaboration with Movistar Plus+.

Almodóvar won the 2024 Venice Film Festival Golden Lion for “The Room Next Door,” distributed stateside by Sony Pictures Classics. “I was very concerned about the English,” Almodóvar told IndieWire about his first film in English. “We wanted an English that should sound American. My films have never been naturalistic. I have never aspired to the mumbling or babbling or pausing or some of those things that happen in regular language. I like my language to be concentrated and precise. In Spanish, it has worked well.”

Every Wes Anderson film is a new adventure for production designer Adam Stockhausen, who has collaborated with the director seven times, and won the Oscar for his work on “The Grand Budapest Hotel.” However, “The Phoenician Scheme” — a 1950s Byzantine espionage fable, inspired by the ancient Middle Eastern civilization — might be the most exotic yet.

The film stars Benicio del Toro as Zsa-Zsa Korda, a larger-than-life European industrialist who survives several assassination attempts while trying to carry out the titular land project of epic proportions. Korda is inspired by Armenian oil baron Calouste Gulbenkian and Lebanese businessman Fouad Malouf, who is Anderson's father-in-law. At its core, though, “The Phoenician Scheme” is a tender father-daughter story, with Mia Threapleton portraying Zsa-Zsa's estranged Liesl, who happens to be a nun.

“I love the story and was immediately excited about the scope and journey Zsa-Zsa takes us on,” Stockhausen told IndieWire. “I think it's exciting to enter a project or set with questions of: ‘Can we do that'? or ‘Will it work'? and genuinely not know the answer. We took on a bunch of those in this one — from the sand pit desert to our stage railway tunnel — and I think we were stretching the limits of what could be achieved theatrically.”

 










Like all Anderson films, it's a process. But this one was different. There were a lot more interior spaces and, for the first time, they built everything on sound stages at Studio Babelsberg in Potsdam, Germany. Stockhausen and the art department sorted out a lot of the mechanical needs first, working in cardboard and unpainted digital models to get the exact shapes, lensing, and positions figured out. Then the finishes came as they moved deeper into the process.

“We actually prepped the movie twice — with the SAG strike interrupting things,” Stockhausen said. Round 2 — where we did all the building — started at the beginning of 2024, and I think we were shooting in early March, so it was a quick build.”

Yet the look came slowly. For Zsa-Zsa's house, which was its own adventure, they did a whole series of sketches in simple white stone before Anderson had the thought to make the place more Italian. They were influenced by Gulbenkian's Paris house and a palazzo in Venice. For the grand entrance gallery, they visited castles and villas around Berlin. They replicated the marble walls and columns with hand-painted craftsmanship. And Anderson wanted originals, so they borrowed a slew of masterpieces, including a Renoir and a Magritte.

 










“We started working on the faux marble, which ultimately led to the painted perspective murals,” Stockhausen added. He worked closely all the way through prep with cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel (in place of Anderson's regular DP Robert Yeoman). “We would try to find together a way to motivate the light for each scene,” he continued. “This was tricky in some of our spaces as they didn't have obvious windows or light sources. Zsa-Zsa's main gallery space, for instance, has a solid ceiling and no windows directly to the outside. In each set, we tried to make the light as integrated as possible into the actual structure of the set itself.”

Production designing the ornate bathroom was an adventure. This was highlighted in the bravura opening credits sequence, where we find Zsa-Zsa comfortably eating while soaking and smoking in the tub. It was shot from the ceiling in slow motion (paying homage to Brian De Palma's “The Untouchables”) and takes in the entire room in a single shot with the balletic movement of his domestic staff in action.

“The bathroom shot was one where the set needed to match the specific requirements of the choreography,” said Stockhausen. “Anna Pinnock [the set decorator] found that incredible solid marble bath as well as the other pieces. The modeling work was especially important here, as everything down to the tile patterning had to line up with the viewing angle spread of the lens.”

 










Meanwhile, other movie references abound. These include Zsa-Zsa's surreal dreams in a Luis Buñuel-inspired heaven (shot in black-and-white and filled with religious iconography).There's also Marseille Bob's (Mathieu Amalric) nightclub, which evokes “Casablanca” along with other French gangster films.

“We looked at the manager's office in ‘Touchez Pas au Grisbi' in particular — the way his little window sees down into the club and dance floor,” Stockhausen said. “Our club went its own direction, but that was a starting point for the conversation.”

For the American intelligence conference room, Stockhausen and Delbonnel played with iconic production designer Ken Adam's expressionism from “Doctor Strangelove” and “Thunderball.” “It's hard not to think of Ken Adam a little bit when you do a huge round conference table,” Stockhausen added.  “Hopefully, the view out the window makes you think a little of Tati as well. The ceiling idea really started in conversation with Bruno. It was his thought to say instead of doing a large circular fixture above, what if we made the entire ceiling into a fixture? Then he would be able to control the light and focus in a very fluid and simple way.”

Best of all, though, was the Egyptian revival-style desert hotel, particularly the ballroom containing a large model of the entire infrastructure project, decorated in pharaohs and hieroglyphics.

 










“We looked at several places, notably the Masonic temple in Philadelphia and the Egyptian wing of the Neues  Museum in Berlin,” said Stockhausen. “I sketched the sets with illustrator Axel Eichorst and art director Marc Bitz. Meanwhile, graphic designers Erica Dorn and Lucile Gauvain laid out all of the hieroglyphics. Our crack team of sign painters stenciled and painted all of them. We had originally planned to convert a defunct local Potsdam parliament building into the hotel. In the end, we were able to do the Nubar [Benedict Cumberbatch] suite and stairway fight there, but a fire destroyed the room we had slated for the ballroom, so that became a stage build at Babelsberg.”

“The Phoenician Scheme is now playing in theaters.

Lena Dunham wants audiences to lean into being “Too Much” sometimes. 

The “Girls” creator is back on TV — this time writing, directing, and executive-producing the series “Too Much” for Netflix. “Hacks” breakout star Megan Stalter plays the Dunham-esque Jessica, who relocates from New York to London to start fresh after a breakup. Despite planning on being alone forever, Jessica soon meets musician Felix (Will Sharpe), who challenges her to reevaluate her 30-something crisis.

Dunham co-created the series with her real-life husband, Luis Felber, who also serves as an executive producer and provides original music. The 10-episode show was announced in 2023. Dunham is the creator, writer, director, and executive producer, and helms eight out of 10 episodes. 

 








Related Stories ‘Eddington' Trailer: Ari Aster's Western of Pandemic Paranoia Hits Theaters After Dividing Cannes Conan O'Brien, Viola Davis, and Ryan Murphy Headline 2025 Television Academy Hall of Fame Class  

The official synopsis of “Too Much” reads: Jessica (Stalter) is “a New York workaholic in her mid-30s, reeling from a broken relationship that she thought would last forever and slowly isolating everyone she knows. When every block in New York tells a story of her own bad behavior, the only solution is to take a job in London, where she plans to live a life of solitude like a Brontë sister. But when she meets Felix (Will Sharpe) — a walking series of red flags — she finds that their unusual connection is impossible to ignore, even as it creates more problems than it solves. Now they have to ask themselves: do Americans and Brits actually speak the same language?”

 










“Girls” alums Rita Wilson and Andrew Rannells also star, along with Andrew Scott, Emily Ratajkowski, Naomi Watts, Stephen Fry, Michael Zegan, Janicza Bravo, Richard E. Grant, Leo Reich, Daisy Bevan, Adele Exarchopoulos, Dean-Charles Chapman, Prasanna Puwanarajah, Rhea Perlman, Kaori Momoi, and Adwoa Aboah.

Dunham told Vanity Fair that “Too Much” is a departure from her “Girls” TV tone. “I didn't even appreciate the luxury I was given on ‘Girls' to do things like bottle episodes, where I stayed with two characters for a night, or let three characters circle around each other. It was just what made sense to me because I'd always written for low budgets,” Dunham said. “I always felt that I had to give people the traditional A, B, and C storylines until episode five. Now I'm much more living under the motto of, ‘If you feel it, go for it.' We never know how many we're going to get. You don't get six seasons of everything.”

Dunham will next direct a feature about the rise and fall of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Dunham will adapt the screenplay from Michael Lewis' New York Times-bestselling book, “Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon.” The Apple Original film comes in partnership with A24.

“Too Much” premieres on Netflix July 10. Check out the trailer below.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Jonathan Mayers, Bonnaroo and Outside Lands Co-Founder, Dies at 51","https://pitchfork.com/news/jonathan-mayers-bonnaroo-and-outside-lands-co-founder-dies-at-51/","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 14:42:19 GMT","

Jonathan Mayers, a co-founder of Superfly Entertainment who also served as a co-founder of game-changing music festivals like Bonnaroo and Outside Lands, has died, Billboard and a Bonnaroo representative confirmed to Pitchfork He was 51.

After growing up a short drive from New York and graduating from Tulane University, in 1995, Mayers immersed himself in the music world through work at the storied New Orleans institutions Tipitina's and Jazz Fest. In 1996, he co-founded the promotion company Superfly Entertainment with Rick Farman, Richard Goodstone, and Kerry Black. The group organized its first concert—the Meters, Maceo Parker, and Rebirth Brass Band—during Mardi Gras, before setting sights on bigger ideas.

In 2002, Mayers and his Superfly coworkers launched the inaugural Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, in Manchester, Tennessee. They sought out an open expanse of land on a farm an hour outside of Nashville, and booked headliners Trey Anastasio (of Phish) and Phil Lesh and Bob Weir (of Grateful Dead) to top the bill. The four co-founders partnered with promoter Ashley Capps of AC Entertainment, agent Chip Hooper of Paradigm Talent Agency, and manager Coran Capshaw of Red Light Management, and the rest was history. The first-ever Bonnaroo sold out, and the 70,000-person capacity festival would go on to become a recurring success. In a few years' time, Bonnaroo would not only inspire dozens of music festivals across America, but also serve as the blueprint for how to rethink music festivals in the modern era under tighter restrictions compared to the Woodstock era.

Just a few years later, Superfly started Vegoose, an annual Halloween music and arts festival, with multi-venue programming across Las Vegas in 2005. Mayers partnered with San Francisco's Another Planet Entertainment to launch Outside Lands, in Golden Gate Park, in 2008. That multi-genre, multi-day music festival grew to become the largest independently owned music festival in the United States.

In addition to starting other events around the country, like the comedy-focused festival Clusterfest in San Francisco in 2017, Mayers also turned his attention toward film and TV rights holders to start immersive experiences for fans. By licensing rights from popular shows like Friends, Seinfeld, The Office, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and more, Mayers and his team recreated TV sets in various cities that allowed fans to “step inside” their favorite series.

In August 2021, Superfly terminated Mayers' position at the company following internal disagreements with the three other co-founders of the entertainment company. The next year, Mayers sued Farman, Goodstone, and Black, accusing them of civil misrepresentation, breach of contract, and fraud over the underestimated value of his shares in Superfly. In January 2023, a New York judge dismissed the lawsuit. Mayers went on to focus on Core City Detroit, a new project investing in a music campus for local artists that also could host public events.

After plenty of teasing this month, both of his own music and a new Talking Heads video for “Psycho Killer,” David Byrne has announced his first solo album in seven years and a tour of North America, Europe, and Australasia. Who Is the Sky? is out September 5 via Matador. Leading the record is lead single “Everybody Laughs,” which comes with a video directed by Gabriel Barcia-Colombo. Watch it below, and scroll down for all the forthcoming tour dates.

All 12 songs on Who Is the Sky? were arranged by members of the New York–based chamber ensemble Ghost Train Orchestra. The follow-up to 2018's American Utopia—Byrne's solo album turned Broadway musical turned concert film—also includes contributions from St. Vincent (with whom he recorded a collaborative LP), Paramore's Hayley Williams (whose music he once covered), the Smile drummer Tom Skinner, and others.

Byrne said in a press release, “Someone I know said, ‘David, you use the word “everybody” a lot.' I suppose I do that to give an anthropological view of life in New York as we know it. Everybody lives, dies, laughs, cries, sleeps and stares at the ceiling. Everybody's wearing everybody else's shoes, which not everybody does, but I have done. I tried to sing about these things that could be seen as negative in a way balanced by an uplifting feeling from the groove and the melody, especially at the end, when St. Vincent and I are doing a lot of hollering and singing together. Music can do that—hold opposites simultaneously.”

Byrne will tour behind the new album extensively next year. The backing band will consist of 13 musicians, singers, and dancers, including members of the American Utopia band, all of whom “will be mobile throughout the set,” according to a press release. The North American leg begins this September, with shows in Australia, New Zealand, and Europe taking place in 2026.

Mavis Staples has shared a new cover of Frank Ocean's “Godspeed.” The Chicago R&B and gospel singer's version of the Blonde album cut was produced by Brad Cook and features spoken word vocals from Kara Jackson. Staples has also announced a tour, which includes festival appearances and solo shows across North America and Europe. Check out Staples' cover of “Godspeed,” plus her tour dates, below.

“Channel Orange was my first introduction to Frank Ocean and I was just amazed at the writing and soulfulness coming from his voice,” Staples said in a press release. “And I loved Blonde when that record came out. That first line in ‘Godspeed' of ‘I will always love you' just crushes me every time I hear it… or sing it. It's just such a beautiful song and he sounds amazing on it so I was a little nervous if we could pull it off. I was honored to sing his words.”

Staples released her most recent album, the Levon Helm collaboration Carry Me Home, in 2022. Last year, she appeared alongside Wilco's Jeff Tweedy on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert to perform the Staple Singers' “Freedom Highway” in conjunction with the 2024 Democratic National Convention.

I know a woman who likes to tell this story about the day she learned about sex. It happened when she was 11, she thinks, after a confusing night kept awake by a series of loud barnyard noises coming from her parents' bedroom. Miserable, the next morning, as to why mom and dad were playing dumb at all her questions about their obvious racket, she chose to reenact everything she'd heard right there at the kitchen table. She made hiccupy gasps, rammed the dinette into the wall like a headboard, moaned, whimpered, and slurped. When at last mom knelt at her side and managed to quell this desperate, heaving child, our heroine looked at her with tears in her eyes. “I heard you,” she said. “You said give it to me hard.”

I admire this story, and not just because it ends with her mother explaining human intercourse to her over a bowl of shredded wheat. I admire it because it makes clear that the problem with growing older is that it proves just how much there is that you don't know. Adulthood's irregular flow of revelations will lead you to the awful conclusion that there will always be something to confuse or torture you anew, and guidance, should you be so lucky to get some, often comes by way of a vessel not of your choosing.

Sensibly, legions of former children have elected to find relief in the steadying baritone of Jarvis Cocker, who, at 61, has spent an entire career mapping the funny, endearing, and usually nightmarish discoveries of pubescence (and post-pubescence, and post-post-pubescence) with his band, Pulp. Across two decades—and nearly four now, with this new album—Cocker has become a laureate of genitalia and the brains that wire them; a psychodramatist of families and the thin-walled homes they live in; a reliable soap-operatist of the hormonal human condition. “I ended up documenting my puberty through pop music,” he said, not long ago. “I wanted it to go through puberty with me.”

This is a monstrous understatement. If we were to print Pulp's entire lyrical oeuvre in one reader-friendly manuscript, the lay analyst would find a songwriter not only locked in the phallic stage, but trapped in an entire phallic theatre. Sex is Pulp's thing: How one can get it, if there is more of it, and whether or not it can happen tonight. The first- and third-person narrators of Pulp tracks are chained to these premises, and not infrequently effecting some sort of sexual misdemeanor in their pursuit. There is a lot of tom-peeping and notable upskirting, stories in which whole cities reach orgasm in miraculous unison, erotic epics that seem to speak directly from the crotch. (This is a discography given to world-historical song titles like “Underwear,” “My Erection,” and “Can I Have My Balls Back, Please.”) With a sort of lothario suavity picked up second-hand from Engelbert Humperdinck, or Bryan Ferry, or Serge Gainsbourg, rare is the Pulp track without a dose of horny sotto voce muttering, sharp sexy inhalations, Cocker squealing like a hog in heat.

But Cocker's sex drive, aside from being hypnotically conspicuous, is a fuel source that allows him to motor through greater vistas. When everyone comes installed with the capacity to desire, what do we actually want, and how badly do we want it? In Pulp songs, all lusts braid together, and become impossible to untangle. His band's hugest, most inescapable track is a class war cabaret that considers how long a Marxist can tolerate a rich girl pretending to be a prole if he really wants to sleep with her. Fables of lumpen households filled with lumpen, libidinal children end with them killed, abused, jailed in the ranks they were born to. One of my favorites is a ballad of a teenage girl murdered on the edge of town by a pervert. “You're such a beautiful girl,” he sings. “And he only did what he did 'cause you looked like one of his kids.”

Pulp's gift for the queasy and sleazy often feels as if the band took the Leonard Cohen line about the value of dignifying what's normally undignified, and made it their credo. “It is easy to display a wound, the proud scars of combat,” Cohen wrote in his first novel. “It is hard to show a pimple.” Pulp is a superflux of boils and pus, and keeps its gaze focused on them to ensure that the hard-to-watch gets seen, the tough-to-hear gets heard. I also suspect Cocker does this because grotesquerie—shorthand for the grisly anxieties, heartbreaks, and sundry strifes of living—gets him off. “People get more furtive and perverse as they get older,” Cocker said with dégagé authority, way back in 1995. “I'm hoping to extend my adolescence as far as possible.""

After 30 years—and 24 of them since we've heard an album from Pulp proper—Cocker maintains a healthy, open perversity, and in More's new rhapsodies of regret and common people, manfully continues to use his sex as a grounding rod. There is a song exactly halfway through this album titled “My Sex.” And here's a line from the album's best single. “Without love,” he shouts in the middle of a cut of Northern soul, “You're just jerking off inside someone else.”

Cocker's gospel this time around—with a little more innocence lost, a lot more experience gained—recasts his perpetual puberty into an embrace of entropy. The world doesn't stop doing what the world wants to do, and Cocker, who has historically served as a sort of floaty, somewhat omniscient character from a distant cloud (“I am not Jesus, but we share the same initials,” he sang in 1998), is here stationed from a nearer foothill. Shuttling us through gardens of nostalgia and loss, memories of things that did or didn't happen, and definitely mentioning his sex drive, the bard of More gestures sweepingly at a life of revelations, sighs, and wonders whether he should have talked to that woman he saw on the street years ago.

More is an album of decisions, where the paths keep forking, and consequences compound. “Though we've never spoken or exchanged emails,” goes “Tina,” a paean to a woman our narrator's never met, “Yes, tonight I'm thinking about scenes from a marriage that never took place.” What happens to life's flow chart when we foreclose a possibility? What happens when—as in “Farmer's Market,” a capacious orchestral ballad about an encounter with an attractive woman in a parking lot—acting on impulse pays off? What would've happened if we didn't go back and get her number? Isn't it time, as the breathy crescendo asks, “We started living?”

In songs that sound like Eurodisco, chanson, theatre-sized string arrangement, and a little bit of Kurt Weill, More's pursuit is the business of living, and the stakes involved therein. Memories of things done and not done catch us erratically—padding about the kitchen, the bedroom—and make the mind reel. The buzz of a fridge, in “Background Noise,” summons the sound of love's long-gone hum, and rockets us into an elegy not far off from the species of heartache summoned in “You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling.” ”My Sex”— which I can sketch out loosely as what would happen if Leonard Cohen asked Martin Amis to write him a song—has his glans become a metonym for his art writ large. “My sex is out of its mind,” he mutters. “My sex is running out of time.”

Cocker's called More “age-apropriate,” which spans not only the poetry inside it, but the noises it makes. We're not dealing with the deliciously cheap and chintzy synths that made those early '90s albums so ridiculously spangly. More goes big and mature with lusher, sometimes even baroque arrangements to surround Cocker's voice—a voice that's huskier, more leaden by time and gravity. The huge quantity of violins on “Hymn of the North” (with members of the Eno family singing backup) makes him sound as rich and blue as the late Scott Walker, a lodestar and former producer. And though the album still has grounding in big fat basslines and BPMs that occasionally flirt with disco, the distinct chug of longtime bassist Steve Mackey—who died in 2023, and to whose memory this album is dedicated—is missing all over. Recording without Mackey “was weird at first,” Cocker says. “It was not the nicest thing.”

But Pulp remains resolutely Pulpy, and the ingredients and pillars that are absent are outpaced by what still is. Cocker yawps as he used to on the other side of the millennium, still invokes a very specific type of woman's name (like Paula, Sylvia, Deborah, and now Tina), and the tracks are peopled by sprawling family trees of imagined mothers, aunts, vicars, sisters, brothers, fathers. “Like two little children under the covers,” goes “Grown Ups,” the album's crux, “I'll be dad, and you'll be the mom.” Like a mid-life callback to 1993's “Babies,” where the fumbly narrator watches his friend's sister have sex through a closet door, it's a track where we witness our narrator caught in the throes of a watershed. What's watersheddy about “Grown-Ups,” though, isn't the spectacle of another sex act, but the slower, more mundane epiphany that adulthood is inherently part of coming-of-age. Children pretend to be mature just as foolishly as adults do, but the pile-up of quotidian acts of idiocy are exactly what builds a life. “We'll make out we know what it is,” he says, “but we don't.” ‘Coming-of-age' might usually be seen as a transitional period we've long since passed but here, Cocker seems to sandwich our palms, look into our eyes, and shake his head no—it's one of those lifelong processes. To paraphrase the chorus, being grown-up has no discrete age or eon; it's an art, or an act.

Perhaps understandably, Cocker, so consumed by the drama of being alive, resists directly rhapsodizing about his own death. (“I am not aging,” he says, tellingly, in “Grown Ups.” “I am just ripening.”) In one of his rare embraces of the end, he announced that “I Never Said I Was Deep,” from Cocker's 2009 solo album, Further Complications, would fit nicely onto his headstone. As far as epitaphs go, sure: a good option. But then I think about it some more. Considering how much time the Pulp frontman has spent hurling such blunt and freakish bolts of human revelation—so much like the thunderstrike of awe, squirmy terror, and relief a child would feel if she, say, just learned about the existence of sex at breakfast—an alternate contender comes to mind. May he live long, but for all the guidance he's dealt us so sharply and generously on More (and everything prior to it), Cocker could stand to be more honest. When the time comes, it should read “HE GAVE IT TO US HARD.”

	As President Donald Trump mobilizes another 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles amid anti-Immigrations and Customs Enforcements (ICE) protests in Los Angeles, California Gov. Gavin Newsom called out Trump's “theatrical display of toughness” and said the president has “crossed a red line in this country.”


	In a severe escalation of federal involvement, Trump signed an order on Saturday authorizing the deployment of National Guard troops, 300 of which were sent to L.A. without the request or consent of city and state officials. The National Guard was last activated without a governor's permission in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson bypassed Alabama's segregationist Gov. George Wallace and sent the troops to protect civil rights protesters marching from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. 


	When speaking with Pod Saves America on Monday, Newsom responded to threats of arrest by the president and his administration, while also lambasting Trump for inciting chaos, using valuable resources, and militarizing city streets. On Monday, border czar Tom Homan said that there was currently “no discussion” about arresting the governor, but didn't rule out the idea. When asked if Homan should arrest Newsom, Trump replied: “I would do it if I were Tom. I think it's great. Gavin likes the publicity, but I think it would be a great thing. He's done a terrible job.”

	Newsom shot back at Trump's remarks during the podcast interview, saying, “I never, ever imagined the President of the United States of America ever saying that about a political opponent.” Remaining defiant, the governor said, “Can we just get it over with?” He added, “They're just weakness masquerading as strength. They're cosplay.”

	Newsom warned that Trump was taking National Guard members “off assignments on forest management, protecting vulnerable communities against summer and wildfire season” and was “removing them from task forces that we've created to deal with fentanyl interdiction.” The governor called Trump's order a “theatrical display of toughness by a president of the United States who's unhinged. It has now crossed a red line in this country.”


	“We need peaceful protests, but we've got elements now coming in that are intentionally trying to create chaos and putting people in harm's way, and it's my biggest fear when we start to militarize our streets and they know this,” Newsom continued. “Trump knows this. It's what he wants. He wants that engagement, and he wants that friction. And I just pray that we can keep people safe and that people are thoughtful as they peacefully protest.”

BTS members RM and V were discharged from the South Korean military on Monday after completing their 18-month mandatory service. Both RM and V were enlisted as active-duty soldiers in the Army. They mark the third and fourth members of the K-Pop group to finish their required time in the military, following J-Hope and Jin, who were released last year. 


	Following their release, RM and V briefly spoke to the press, where they said they planned to return to the stage soon, according to Reuters. 


	RM, V, Jimin, Jungkook, and Suga all enlisted around similar times (RM and V enlisted individually through their own procedures, while Jimin and Jung Kook enlisted at the same time). Jungkook and Jimin are set to be released later this week, and Suga will be released at the end of the month. Suga was assigned alternative service, which typically involves a shorter duration, and will be the last BTS member to return from service.

	For almost a year now, I've had to dedicate an unusually large amount of brain space to two figures who, to be frank, had previously occupied next to none: Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. 


	As someone who both uses the internet and reads the news (I'm a rare unicorn, I know), details of the ongoing feud between the two actors have been practically inescapable. Ever since rumors of disharmony between the pair began bubbling up last summer during the launch of their movie It Ends With Us, people on TikTok, in the tabloids, and even at the New York Times have been obsessively chronicling every new detail of what is now an incredibly messy legal spat. Even Taylor Swift has been roped into the drama. The latest shocking development came on Monday when a judge tossed out a $400 million lawsuit Baldoni had filed against Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds. But amid the claims and counterclaims, it's been dizzying to try to keep up with what's going on — or understand why it's occupying so much media real estate. 

	











	Yet while the saga is complex, it's also revealed a lot about the behind-the-scenes machinations of Hollywood, and the central influence publicists and lawyers hold in the industry. Perhaps most interestingly, though, it's also made me think a lot about the ways in which celebrity image is crafted in the public eye, as well as where things currently stand almost eight years after the #MeToo movement exploded.  


But to make sense of it all, we need to first talk about Blake Lively…












	I think it's fair to say that the public fascination with the case wouldn't be what it is were it not for it involving Lively, 37, who has long been a figure in the lives of Millennial women (and gay men, like yours truly) thanks to her early roles in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants movies and, of course, Gossip Girl. Because of her glamorous and scandalous It Girl part in the CW series, in particular, Lively immediately became fodder for the tabloids. They greedily chronicled her relationships with on-screen boyfriend Penn Badgley and then Green Lantern costar Reynolds, whom she married (infamously on a plantation) in 2012.

	But her subsequent projects left much to be desired. Lively became mostly famous for, well, being Blake Lively: tall, slender, beautiful, and suspiciously perfect — a patron saint for the Instagram age. Goop-pilled, she launched products and websites, but her creative projects felt pedestrian and uninspiring. Around 2016, she was more famous for being in Taylor Swift's Squad, appearing at the Met Gala, and the “relatable” ways she and Reynolds would lovingly troll one another on social media than she was for any recent films or TV work. (I'd argue the only really exciting thing she's done in the last decade is 2018's A Simple Favor because she actively leaned into parodying her “perfect” public image).


	All of which is to say, much of Lively's fame has been built up around the public image she's carefully crafted for herself — which, it turns out, is a dangerous way to have a career in Hollywood because it leaves you vulnerable to a public keen to take a look under the hood. 


Which brings us to Justin Baldoni…


	Prior to *gestures wildly* all this, Baldoni, 41, was most famous for playing the hearthrob lead in the CW's telenovela-inspired Jane The Virgin. After the series wrapped in 2019, he began directing sappy feature films — Five Feet Apart (2019) and Clouds (2020), both of which oddly feature characters navigating love while battling serious health problems — but much of his public image was being built around him positioning himself as an enemy of toxic masculinity. In 2017, he launched an online talk show in this vein, The Men's Room, which was followed by a book and podcast. Despite these efforts, Baldoni somehow always had the air of someone trying a little too hard to be an #Ally, as if he were Nev Schulman declaring, “This elevator is abuse free.” Just like with Lively, people had an urge to know if it was all an act.

And now on to the final piece of the puzzle, It Ends With Us…


	In 2019, Baldoni's production company, Wayfarer Studios, acquired the rights to It Ends With Us, the best-selling 2016 novel by Colleen Hoover, which at that point had sold over a million copies and been translated into 20 languages. The book further exploded in popularity in 2021 thanks to viral tearful videos on TikTok, which helped send it to the top of the New York Times Best Seller list. In short, it's beloved by many fans, which meant a film adaptation was always going to get a lot of attention.


It Ends With Us tells the story of a Boston florist named — wait for it — Lily Bloom (Lively), her abusive relationship with neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid (Baldoni, who also directed the movie), and her reconnection with Atlas Corrigan (Brandon Sklenar), the boyfriend she had as a teenager who helped her deal with her abusive father.


	It took a few years to get production started in 2023 — only for things to be halted for several months due to strikes by the WGA and SAG-AFTRA. It was finally released in August 2024, but…


…the wheels started to fall off before it even hit cinemas


	The rollout to the movie's release was, scientifically speaking, a clusterfuck. On TikTok, keen-eyed observers began obsessively parsing the film's publicity tour like they were Charlie in that one conspiracy meme from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Why were Baldoni and Lively never pictured together? Or even apparently in the same place at the same time? Why did Baldoni follow all his castmates on Instagram, only for none of them to follow him back? Why was Baldoni promoting the film as a somber exploration of domestic violence, while Lively seemed keener to lean into the romance and flowers of it all? And why was she promoting her alcohol and haircare products all at the same time?


	On the film's very first weekend in theaters, the drama was impossible to ignore. Citing sources, the Hollywood Reporter said the rift centered around “a fracture among the filmmakers in the post-production process, wherein two different cuts of the movie emerged.”


	Another key event: The day after the film was released in cinemas, a Norwegian journalist Kjersti Flaa uploaded an old video to YouTube entitled, “The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job.” The 2016 interview to promote Woody Allen's Café Society made for tense viewing, with the pregnant Lively seeming to take immediate offense to Flaa congratulating her on her “little bump” and questions about the movie's costumes. Flaa later told the New York Times the timing of her upload was a coincidence, but it did seem to fuel perceptions online that Lively was secretly a Mean Girl right as the apparent feud with Baldoni was taking off. 

	











	And yet, despite all the off-screen drama, the film proved successful, bringing in almost $350 million — a sum 14 times bigger than its $25 million production budget. 


Truth be told, this all would have probably gone away were it not for what happened next


	It's very possible all this would've gone the way of the Don't Worry Darling (2022) press tour were it not for a bombshell report that the New York Times dropped in mid-December. The outlet revealed that not only had Baldoni hired an expert in crisis public relations over the summer who had said she could help to “bury” Lively's reputation, but that Lively had filed a legal complaint with the California Civil Rights Department, alleging mistreatment during and after production. In that complaint, as well as in a lawsuit she subsequently filed against Baldoni, Lively claimed the actor and James Heath, CEO of Wayfarer Studios, had sexually harassed her and launched a smear campaign in the press to damage her reputation, causing her “severe emotional distress.” 


	In the lawsuit, Lively revealed that she'd forced a meeting in January 2024, prior to production resuming after the strikes, to make a series of demands to deal with the “hostile work environment.” Reynolds was also said to be in attendance. The demands Lively made, and which Baldoni and Heath agreed to, implied the men had talked about sex or shown pornography to her, described their genitals to her, improvised kissing scenes, entered her trailer when she was undressed, and secretly spoken with her personal trainer in order to get her to lose weight for the picture. (Baldoni later said he was “blindsided” by these “fictional” concerns and only agreed to implement the protections so that production could resume.)


	Lively also alleged that as part of a plan to “destroy” her reputation, Baldoni had worked with his publicists to plant stories in the press and in social media posts via a “digital army” that would paint her in a negative light. 


	News of Lively's legal complaint and Baldoni's PR blitz seemed to turn public sympathies in her direction. Lively's costars in the Sisterhood movies — America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn, and Alexis Bledel — released a joint statement standing with her and stating they had seen her “summon the courage to ask for a safe workplace” during filming of It Ends With Us. Hoover also backed Lively, calling her “honest, kind, supportive, and patient.” Baldoni also faced blowback: an award that had been bestowed on him by a women's empowerment group was rescinded, and his podcast cohost, Liz Plank, quit. 

	











Suddenly, the battle shifted from the press to the courtroom… 


	As soon as Lively kicked off her legal battle, Baldoni responded in kind. What followed has been months of claims and counterclaims, press statements and counter-statements, as well as a libel lawsuit from Baldoni against the Times. Key to Baldoni's case both against the newspaper — and the $250 million lawsuit he filed against Lively, Reynolds, and their publicist in January —  is his allegation that the newspaper “cherry-picked” from text messages and removed context in order to “mislead” readers — allegations the Times denied. “It is painfully ironic that Blake Lively is accusing Justin Baldoni of weaponizing the media when her own team orchestrated this vicious attack by sending the New York Times grossly edited documents prior to even filing the complaint,” his lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said. 


	Per Baldoni, it's Lively who was using publicists to find a “scapegoat” after her “self-inflicted press catastrophe” during the movie promotion. He claims he had only hired his crisis PR team as a form of defense. As part of his strategy, Baldoni created a website to share evidence related to the case with the public. It included a number of text message exchanges between the two actors, including one in which Lively had invited Baldoni to her trailer to work on lines while she pumped breast milk. Baldoni also released raw footage of a dance scene between the pair in which Lively had claimed he'd improvised kissing her neck, claiming it refuted her characterization. Her team said it was still “damning evidence,” but the judge later said the footage showed there was no unprofessional conduct in the scene.


In Baldoni's telling, it's Lively who was the on-set bully


	In his lawsuit, Baldoni accused Lively of stealing the movie out from under him, seizing control of costuming, the script, and edits by threatening to walk away altogether if she didn't get her way. Through “extortionate threats,” she was even permitted to create her own cut of the movie, which Baldoni was not allowed to see, but which he and the studio were ultimately pressured into releasing. She allegedly strong-armed the studio into granting her a producer credit and removing Baldoni from marketing materials and posters, while also convincing her castmates and Hoover to “shun” him. Baldoni alleged he was only allowed to attend the premiere on the condition that he and his family be ushered off the red carpet before Lively arrived and watch the movie in a separate theater. 

	











	Reynolds did not come across well, either. In addition to allegedly “berating” Baldoni at the January meeting, he apparently tried to convince Baldoni's agents to drop him by calling him a “sexual predator.” Reynolds was also said to have created a parody character of Baldoni, the faux-feminist Nicepool, in his movie Deadpool & Wolverine, who was then killed by Ladypool, a character voiced by Lively. 


	There are other places you can go to read more detailed timelines of all the legal filings and press statements (it would take at least another 2,000 words to get through it all here), but one of the more notable recent developments was a ruling earlier this month from the federal judge overseeing the case, who ruled that Lively won't be able to make a claim of “emotional distress,” a claim her legal team had said she was already willing to withdraw. Baldoni's team has said Lively was refusing to grant them access to medical records that might presumably prove whether she had suffered psychologically.


Which brings us to Taylor Swift…


	Baldoni claimed Lively had essentially used her friend Swift to pressure him into accepting a rewrite of a key rooftop scene between their characters by having the singer and Reynolds both praise Lively's edits. 


	In a subsequent message that made eyes roll to the back of heads everywhere, Lively compared herself to Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones and implied Reynolds and Swift were her dragons: “I'm Khaleesi, and like her, I happen to have a few dragons. For better or worse, but usually for better. Because my dragons also protect those I fight for. So really we all benefit from those gorgeous monsters of mine.”


	Baldoni's team subpoenaed Swift in May, seeking to find out exactly what Lively had told her during filming. They also alleged that Lively essentially blackmailed Swift into supporting her publicly, or private texts between the two friends would be released — a claim subsequently tossed out by the judge. Baldoni's team ultimately dropped their effort to subpoena Swift. 


But then the judge made a shocking ruling


	On Monday, Judge Lewis J. Liman issued a ruling in which he dismissed Baldoni's lawsuits against Lively, Reynolds, and the New York Times. He wrote that Baldoni had failed to prove that Lively's actions during filming were “wrongful extortion rather than legally permissible hard bargaining or renegotiation of working conditions,” or that he had been damaged by these actions. He also said that Baldoni hadn't shown Lively had made any defamatory claims other than what she had filed with the California Civil Rights Department (which are privileged), or that Reynolds, the couple's publicist, or the New York Times “would have seriously doubted these statements were true based on the information available to them, as is required for them to be liable for defamation under applicable law.”

	











	However, the judge did leave Baldoni an opening to refile a lawsuit for a breach of implied covenant and tortious interference with a contract.


	Lively's lawyers, Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb, called the ruling “a total victory and a complete vindication” of her case. “As we have said from day one, this ‘$400 million' lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it,” the pair said.


All this now leaves us in an interesting place


	With any trial regarding the matter not set to begin until March 9, 2026, we still have months of he-said, she-said limbo left to come. 


	For their part, though, Reynolds and Lively do seem aware of how much scrutiny they've received. When they appeared at the Saturday Night Live 50th anniversary special, Reynolds made a joke about all the negative headlines. When Tina Fey asked Reynolds how things were going, he replied anxiously, “Great. Why? What have you heard?!”


Because, at this point, who you believe is a matter of opinion


	There are many corners of the internet where Baldoni is now framed as the real victim, but others still support Lively and have compared her treatment in the press to that of Amber Heard, shaming the public for seemingly needing a “perfect victim.” This is because, in a bigger sense, the battle for our hearts and minds is still being waged — only now it's through legal filings. How much of what we're reading in these lawsuits isn't necessarily for the judge or jury, but for those of us at home? “Predominantly, these are PR campaigns dressed up as lawsuits,” Gregory Doll, a litigator who has handled high-profile entertainment cases, told Variety. “But there are teeth in the lawsuits.” 


But the whole saga also makes clear just how much our view of celebrities is manufactured


	If you've ever wondered why you have an inexplicable dislike for a certain star, the Lively-Baldoni feud has painted the clearest picture yet of just how much our public perceptions are shaped by publicists. More often than not, they're trying to make us like their clients, but this can often backfire if they don't get the tone right. (Consider the backlash that Anne Hathaway got when she was campaigning for an Oscar but was perceived as too thirsty. Don't worry, she's since recovered.) But we also know that publicists often want to protect their clients by throwing heat on someone else, sometimes through negative headlines from favorable editors or through “astroturfing” online outrage with fake social media accounts (as Baldoni is alleged to have done here). This enables other outlets to still cover the “outrage,” without feeling like they're carrying out the express whims of a publicist. 

	











It's also impossible not to see this whole case as a temperature check on the #MeToo Movement


	The reflection of Donald Trump after he was found liable of sexual assault has, for many people, erased much of the legacy of the #MeToo movement and its promise of consequences and accountability. Even Andrew Cuomo is seeking a comeback.

	But the It Ends With Us drama also shows just how much has changed since those Harvey Weinstein stories first came out in 2017, kicking off the #MeToo movement. Most notably, this is because of the Amber Heard and Johnny Depp trial — the first major celebrity story since the movement began, where it became publicly acceptable to state that you didn't believe a woman's allegations. Now, TikTok is flooded with videos in which people say they don't believe the “narrative” that Lively is perpetuating. It's not just our politics that have shifted. “We are no longer in the #MeToo era. The standard of ‘believing women' did not really become a standard,” Doreen St. Felix wrote in the New Yorker of the Lively-Baldoni case. “What matters is which side's story is better suited to the politics of our time.”


In the end, we are all kind of like that “Sickos” guy from the Onion cartoon, peering into the window and chanting, “Yes…HA HA HA… YES!”The public will always be obsessed with a juicy, underhanded feud between two Hollywood stars. It's a tradition, as Ryan Murphy told us, that goes back to Joan Crawford and Bette Davis. So the Lively and Baldoni fight was always going to be a media event. But because both stars also had such carefully constructed public images, there has been a large amount of schadenfreude for many people in watching them be picked apart or, at the very least, exposed for the work that's gone into building them.

	Inside a packed arena at the University of Montana in April, 20-year-old Lander Busse stepped onto the stage to thunderous applause. More than 9,000 people had turned out here in Missoula for the Fighting Oligarchy rally organized by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — a remarkable crowd in a state that went to Donald Trump by nearly 20 points and ousted longtime Democratic Senator Jon Tester in favor of a novice MAGA Republican.


	Busse was here at the request of Senator Sanders, who had invited on stage plaintiffs from the Held v. Montana case — the landmark verdict in which a group of youth won against the state for violating their Constitutional right to a healthy environment by knowingly contributing to climate change. Busse was quick to accept. Standing at the lectern alongside fellow plaintiff 21-year-old Olivia Vesovich to amp up the crowd before Sanders and AOC took the floor, emanating confidence from his six-foot-four frame, Busse appeared made for the stage.

	











	“Governor Gianforte and the Attorney General threw everything they had at us,” he boomed into the microphone, re-capping the Montana court victory. “But just like all of you here today, we would not be silenced. They thought we wouldn't put up a fight. But they were wrong.”

	People in the bleachers rose for a standing ovation. After the approving roar died down, Busse hinted at what was to come. “Very soon, we will be taking the fight from Montana to D.C.,” he said. He ended his speech with a call to the attendees. “Have the courage to believe in something better. Do what we did. Roll up your sleeves, get dirty, and have the courage to join us to take our nation back.” As the crowd erupted, Busse raised his fist in the air.

	










 “They thought we wouldn't put up a fight. But they were wrong.”


	Less than a month and a half later, Busse, along with 21 other youths, including Busse's younger brother Badge, sued the Trump administration for violating their Fifth Amendment rights to life, liberty, and property with a suite of executive orders aimed at increasing America's fossil fuel production. Just like the Held case was, this federal case has the potential to be precedent-setting as one of the most important for the health of future generations — if the youth win. And in the center of the photo widely circulated to media by Our Children's Trust, the non-profit public interest law firm which filed Lighthiser v. Trump on behalf of the youth plaintiffs, holding a microphone to his lips and looking more like a budding rock star than an activist, was Lander Busse.


	BUSSE SPOKE TO ME LAST WEEK FROM A ranch outside Missoula where he's working for the summer. Crickets chirped in the background as he told me that he essentially grew up with the Held case. He was 15 years old when he signed on to it, alarmed at how climate change was affecting fly fishing, hunting, and other characteristics of his lifestyle here that are deeply connected to the land and the health of that land. “With the propaganda produced by both the federal and state [of Montana] level, people have been brainwashed into believing that the degradation of the places they love is just a way of life. But it doesn't have to be this way,” he tells me.


	Busse was 18 when the case finally went to trial, and 20 by the time the Montana Supreme Court upheld the verdict last December. Living in ultra-conservative Kalispell, he and his brother Badge had minimal local support for their involvement in the case. Both lost friends over it, and Badge worried about possible armed intimidation outside the Helena courtroom where the youth plaintiffs testified two summers ago after he'd had an AK-47 aimed at him during a 2020 Black Lives Matter rally in nearby Whitefish (no armed protestors popped up in Helena).

	“We knew when we filed the Held case that it would be a long fight and it would be hard. We knew that the state would beat us down. Or that they would try to beat us down,” Busse says. To be met with such wild applause at the April rally took his breath away. “It was this feeling of elation that we're part of progress, of helping fix this thing. We're more driven than ever to keep fighting.”


	Back in December, around the time the state Supreme Court upheld Held v. Montana, Busse got word that a similar federal case — Juliana v. United States, which had launched a wave of youth-led climate lawsuits around the country — would be dismissed after languishing unsuccessfully for nearly a decade. That case had argued that the government's policies promoting the production and export of fossil fuel use over many decades violated young people's Fifth Amendment rights. A Ninth Circuit of Appeals Court dismissed the case back in 2020, saying courts were not the right venue to address climate change. Although the Held case had since set precedent for courts to address climate change, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal. Within weeks after the dismissal, Busse was on the phone with Our Children's Trust attorneys as Trump began to make good on his campaign promises to prop up America's fossil fuel industry. A new opportunity was brewing, this time with clear and shorter-term legal targets.

Lighthiser v. Trump takes aim at three of President Trump's executive orders: Unleash American Energy, specific to developing fossil fuel energy and rolling back renewable energy; Declaring a National Energy Emergency, which accelerates the identification, leasing, production, and transportation of domestic crude oil, gas and coal; and Reinvigorating America's Beautiful Clean Coal Energy. This last smacks of retaliation for the Held victory, since Montana is one of the top five coal producers in the U.S.; its extraction levels are higher than that of entire countries, including Brazil, with total annual fossil fuel emissions on the order of 160 tons of CO2. In addition, the Colstrip power plant in eastern Montana, the only coal plant in the nation without modern pollution controls and which emits more harmful soot than any other American power plant, received a Trump exemption from a Biden administration rule that compelled it to install new equipment.

	











	The Lighthiser lawsuit alleges that these orders are unconstitutional. Under the Fifth Amendment that protects our rights to life, liberty, or property, “government can't intentionally and knowingly put us in harm's way or enhance a dangerous situation we're already in — which is what these executive orders do to our plaintiffs,” explains Julia Olson, an attorney with Our Children's Trust, which filed the suit. “They're already living in a climate emergency, and have severe health injuries, and injuries to their homes, family businesses, and ways of life.”


	In a statement to Rolling Stone, White House representative Taylor Rogers says, “The American people are more concerned with the future generations' economic and national security, which is why they elected President Trump in a landslide victory to restore America's energy dominance. Future generations should not have to foot the bill of the left's radical climate agenda.” (Trump actually pulled in less than 50% of the popular vote, making the 2024 presidential election the second-closest since 1968.)


	The executive orders state that they're intended to protect American prosperity and energy security. “But if there's an energy emergency, you don't shut down wind, solar efficiency measures, and energy storage measures,” Olson points out. “You want to expand those because they create energy security. If you want American prosperity, you want people to pay the least amount for energy, and you want the energy to be safe and not cause trillions of dollars in economic harm and damage to the nation because of all the extreme disasters we're facing.

	










“This is about the health of children and their opportunity for a prosperous and healthy and joyful future.”


	“The government is saying, very bluntly, that it's going to unleash fossil fuels, block clean renewable energy that would avoid pollution, and take down all the climate science and information that helps people stay safe, or at least to know when the danger is coming.”


	Although the Held case took years to go to trial and the Juliana case stalled out in legal purgatory for even longer, Olson believes this lawsuit will move quickly. “A lot of the cases challenging other executive orders are moving on fast tracks. I expect that we'll have a decision before this administration is over.”


	But even before the case goes to trial, Our Children's Trust is asking the court to freeze implementation of the orders pending a full decision, in hopes of stopping more fossil fuel emissions (which the plaintiffs, and the next generation after them, will have to live with, Olson says) from entering the atmosphere while the case is heard.


	Olson wants people to know that this lawsuit isn't about politics; she grew up in a Republican family herself, she says. “This is about science and listening to doctors. It's about the health of children and their opportunity for a prosperous and healthy and joyful future. If you talk to young people today, they don't see those opportunities. They see a world of harm and devastation and loss. And we need to change that for them.”


	RIPLEY, AN 18-YEAR-OLD PLAINTIFF in the Lighthiser case, just graduated from high school in Livingston, Montana. She requests that I not use her last name or disclose where she plans to go college. When I ask if she's worried about retaliation, she says, “Well, yeah. We're suing the President of the United States, arguably the most powerful man on the planet. And we've seen again and again throughout this administration, and the last one he had, that he's not too keen on people who try to push back against him.”


	Determination outweighs Ripley's worry, though. She's one of those youth who don't see a bright future ahead. She grew up fishing the Yellowstone River with her father, backpacking, hiking, and skiing. She wanted to pass on those outdoor traditions to her own children. But she's not sure she wants to have a family in an environment that, as she hears constantly, is dying around her. She's also experienced it, she says. “I've seen awful things in my day-to-day life that have affected me personally.”


	In 2020, the county sheriff knocked on her family's door and told them to start packing their things; the Bridger Foothills Fire was raging fast over Bozeman Pass. She could see the flames. Her home ended up unscathed, but 28 others burned. The EPA states that “higher temperatures and drought are likely to increase the severity, frequency, and extent of wildfires in Montana.”


	Two years later, the Yellowstone River flooded catastrophically after an atmospheric river dropped unprecedented amounts of rain, which experts say was an extreme weather event exacerbated by climate change. Ripley joined other community members at the fairgrounds to fill sandbags to keep levees from breaking. The flood damaged homes and ranches, demolished bridges and parts of roads, and devastated Yellowstone tourism and the income of the people who relied on it.

	











	When Ripley heard about the Held case, she asked her teacher if the Green Initiative group she was part of in high school could go up to Helena to watch the trial. “I watched multiple testimonies, people on the stand, and it was really inspirational. These were kids my age, from my state, and they were changing the world. They were taking their state to court. And they won. That was hugely moving for me. I realized that just because I'm from the middle of nowhere, that doesn't mean I can't create change.”


	Ripley's Green Initiative group worked hard last year to convince the school board to switch over to electric school buses, and to secure an EPA grant to buy them. But then that funding was frozen this year by the Trump administration. So when the opportunity came to be involved in the Lighthiser case, Ripley jumped at it. “It was obvious,” she says. “There was no other choice.”


	GIVEN THAT WE'RE IN AN UNPRECEDENTED moment in which a presidential administration has signaled its willingness to ignore the rulings of courts, one of three co-equal branches of government, I ask Olson for her perspective on the current weight of lawsuits — especially one as precedent-setting as Lighthiser.


	The thing about the courts and the Constitution, she says, “is that we have to use them. Or we'll lose them both. But I also believe that our institutions and the people of the United States won't tolerate a president who is going to disregard court orders and continue to consolidate power and wealth at the expense of ordinary Americans,”


	Busse says he's not worried about any strong-arming from the Trump administration. After his experiences with the Held case, nothing surprises him anymore. Maybe there was an era when there was decorum in these processes, he says, but he's never seen it in his lifetime. He holds fast to the belief that the science and the body of evidence upon which the youth rest their case will be vindicated by history.


	“We know we're on the right side of things,” he says. “And we know the importance of this. We're going for the throat with this one.”

	Fresh off performing “Burning Down the House” with Olivia Rodrigo at Governors Ball, David Byrne has announced a new album. Who Is the Sky? arrives Sept. 5 via Matador Records.


	To accompany the announcement, Byrne released the lead single “Everybody Laughs,” a kaleidoscopic and joyous capturing of society, particularly New Yorkers: “Everybody's going through the garbage/Looking for inspiration/Someone find it staring at the ceiling/Of the subway station.” 


	“Someone I know said, ‘David, you use the word “everybody” a lot,'” Byrne said in a statement. “I suppose I do that to give an anthropological view of life in New York as we know it. Everybody lives, dies, laughs, cries, sleeps and stares at the ceiling. Everybody's wearing everybody else's shoes, which not everybody does, but I have done.”


	“I tried to sing about these things that could be seen as negative in a way balanced by an uplifting feeling from the groove and the melody, especially at the end, when St. Vincent and I are doing a lot of hollering and singing together,” he continued. “Music can do that – hold opposites simultaneously. I realized that when singing with Robyn earlier this year. Her songs are often sad, but the music is joyous.”

Who Is the Sky? follows 2018's American Utopia, which morphed into a stellar Broadway show and Spike Lee-directed HBO film. Produced by Kid Harpoon, the new album features contributions from St. Vincent (whom he collaborated with on 2012's Love This Giant), Paramore's Hayley Williams (on the new track “What Is the Reason for It?”), the Smile's Tom Skinner, and more. The album is available for pre-order now, including a trippy cantaloupe orange/pink vinyl variant.

	











	Byrne said that the record is “a chance to be the mythical creature we all harbor inside. A chance to step into another reality. A chance to transcend and escape from the prison of our ‘selves.'” 


	He added: “At my age, at least for me, there's a ‘don't give a shit about what people think' attitude that kicks in. I can step outside my comfort zone with the knowledge that I kind of know who I am by now and sort of know what I'm doing. That said, every new set of songs, every song even, is a new adventure. There's always a bit of, ‘how do I work this?' I've found that not every collaboration works, but often when they do, it's because I'm able to clearly impart what it is I'm trying to do. They hopefully get that, and as a result, we're now joined together heading to the same unknown place.”

Amid bizarre rumors about the re-engineering of alien spacecraft and sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) over the ‘secretive' Area 51, an explosive Pentagon report released recently claims that UFO sightings were just conspiracy theories planted and amplified by it as a cover-up for classified military programs. 

In July 2022, the Pentagon established the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to investigate Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) across air, sea, and space. As part of their study, the investigators, led by Sean Kirkpatrick, the first director of the AARO, reviewed government documents dating back to 1945 and interrogated current and former military officers.

The agency discovered that the US military intentionally planted UFO conspiracy theories, including those linked to Area 51, to hide classified weapons programs during the Cold War. This report, published by AARO, was first reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. 

“A tiny Pentagon office had spent months investigating conspiracy theories about secret Washington UFO programs when it uncovered a shocking truth: At least one of those theories had been fueled by the Pentagon itself,” the WSJ report stated.

According to the investigation, these disinformation efforts were aimed at concealing the testing of military equipment from people who had unintentionally witnessed classified military tests. The Pentagon disseminated disinformation, including photoshopped images of flying saucers. It is still unclear to investigators if these activities were centralised military programs or local efforts.

At least one of the theories was cooked to conceal the testing of the F-117 Night Hawk, the US Air Force's first prime stealth fighter jet. In the 1980s, an Air Force colonel visited a Nevada bar near Area 51 and gave the owner forged photos of flying saucers near the secret government base. Thus, creating a frenzy over UFO sightings in the region.

The colonel, now retired, confessed to the Pentagon that he was following official orders to create a “smokescreen” to hide the F-117 testing. This was done because the military believed that hiding its new technology in the avalanche of conspiracy theories about Area 51 was the best way to conceal it from the Soviet Union's eyes during the Cold War.

As planned, the UFO sightings became the most discussed subjects at the time, and the forged images were put up on the walls of the bar, signalling rising public interest.

The new findings are significant because ‘Area 51,' which is a part of the Nevada Test and Training Range, has been a lightning rod for UFO speculation for decades. It has had the highest per-capita UFO sighting rate in the United States (820.9 per 100,000 residents).

For years, analysts believed that many of these UFO sightings were likely just classified military programs. And, they were right. In 2013, for instance, the CIA declassified documents confirming Area 51's role in testing U-2 spy planes, SR-71 Blackbirds, and other advanced aircraft, explaining some UFO sightings as misidentified military projects.

However, doubts over military cover-ups have been around for only a while.

Kirkpatrick's team discovered that the government purposefully kept people in the dark about covert military projects. For instance, retired Air Force Captain Robert Salas saw a UFO fly down over a nuclear missile test site in Montana in 1967.

At the time, all 10 nuclear missiles at the bunker and the electrical equipment were rendered inoperable by what was described as a flashing light. Salas insisted that he saw alien visitors. However, he was told never to discuss it with anyone.

Kirkpatrick's team found that Salas was never informed that what he observed was a test of an emerging electromagnetic pulse to determine whether American silos could withstand the radiation of atomic weapons and respond in retaliation should the Soviet Union launch an initial attack. Salas was allowed to believe it was aliens that he had spotted.

If this deception was not enough, the Pentagon also involved officers and commanders to lend its lies more credibility. The WSJ report notes,  ”For decades, certain new commanders of the Air Force's most classified programs, as part of their induction briefings, would be handed a piece of paper with a photo of what looked like a flying saucer.”

Many of these commanders were told they were part of a program called “Yankee Blue,” which was designed to reverse-engineer extra-terrestrial technology. The unsuspecting officers bought this and signed non-disclosure agreements to keep it confidential. 

The officers never found out that it was a ruse, and the practice continued unabated until 2023. According to the WSJ report, a memo was written by the defense secretary's office in 2023, directing that the practice cease immediately; however, the harm had already been done. 

AARO released an extensive report (hailed as historic) in March 2024, stating that there was no evidence that the US officials had encountered aliens. It asserted that most sightings were just misidentified ordinary objects, adding that some cases required further study. 

It noted that tests of sophisticated US spy planes and space technologies in the 1950s and 1960s led to a surge in UFO encounters. There was “no evidence” that the US government had come across extraterrestrial life, the investigators wrote, adding that the majority of UFO sightings were ordinary objects from Earth.

“The proliferation of television programmes, books, movies, and the vast amount of internet and social media content centred on UAP-related topics most likely has influenced the public conversation on this topic, and reinforced these beliefs within some sections of the population,” it noted.

The investigators emphasised that there is a “particularly persistent narrative” that the government has retrieved spacecraft and extraterrestrial remains while plotting to conceal its alien research endeavors.

The report noted that officials have not found any evidence of extraterrestrial visitors despite approaching the claim with an open mind, thus addressing previous claims made by former US intelligence officer, David Grusch. In June 2023, Grusch alleged that the US government has operated a “multi-decade” program to recover and reverse-engineer crashed UAPs of “non-human origin,” including intact and partially intact vehicles, under a program named “Immaculate Constellation.”

Presenting the report, AARO stated that there are still 50 to 100 UAP sightings every month, highlighting ongoing conjecture regarding official cover-ups. However, at the time, the report made no mention of a potential cover-up.

Notably, the Pentagon has now acknowledged that not all of the information regarding the AARO's findings has been released to the public, adding that the military claims it will be more open in its follow-up report later this year. “The department is committed to releasing a second volume of its Historical Record Report, to include AARO's findings on reports of potential pranks and inauthentic materials,” the DOD said in a statement.

The new report is a welcome step towards the declassification of UFO/UAP files. However, it casts doubt over previous reports of sightings, in which several US officers have admitted to experiencing multiple UAPs in their careers. For example, a former US Navy pilot, Ryan Graves, who formerly piloted an F/A-18, told Fox News about an incident where two aircraft from his squadron flew side by side, and one of these unidentified objects flew directly between them. Graves said that a team member characterized the object as a “dark gray or black cube inside of a clear sphere.”

There are several such instances, which may or may not turn out to be an eyewash.

For now, more details and transparency from the Pentagon are awaited.

Patrick Djordjevic 

(NewsNation) — Legendary UFO journalist George Knapp believes it will take a whistleblower with tangible evidence to uncover what the Pentagon and other agencies have hidden from the American people for several decades.

Knapp told “Cuomo” he does not believe those who harbor secrets about the realities of UFOs are “going to give this up.”

“We created the story about Area 51, we created this story about nukes being disabled. That's all us. All the technology that people have been seeing in the skies around the world, on every culture, every continent throughout human history, that's us,” Knapp said sarcastically. 

“It's preposterous. It's ridiculous. There's no way we could we could ever accept it,” he added. 

Knapp also believes there are often more pressing news items and current affairs than UFOs, and as such, “people who tell these lies get away with it.”

Chris Cuomo said a shift will occur in the desire from both sides of the political aisle to uncover more about UFOs once they realize it can be a worthwhile political tool.

“One of these two poison parties is going to realize there's something in this issue for them versus the other one, and they'll go all-in down that road,” Cuomo said.

“And these cats are all about advantage, never about advancement of anything but their own aims.”

Patrick Djordjevic 

(NewsNation) — Could the whole UFO culture have been fueled, intentionally, by a Pentagon disinformation campaign that spanned decades?

Not according to NewsNation special correspondent Ross Coulthart. 

“I think the hilarious thing about this, it's such a joke this Wall Street Journal article, because it's effectively admitting what we've known for years,” Coulthart said on “Elizabeth Vargas Reports.” “Which is that there are people, gatekeepers to the secret about this legacy UAP program, who have been lying to and deceiving the American public for years.”

A new report from The Wall Street Journal alleges the U.S. military knew that UFOs weren't of alien origin but purposely spread that rumor for decades to help them hide top-secret programs from the public and America's enemies.

The article raises the question of whether some of the biggest names to come forward in recent years, like Pentagon whistleblower David Grusch, could have been fed fake information about UFOs and top-secret UFO programs.

Per the article, the military was testing a top-secret stealth fighter in Area 51 during the Cold War. The Journal claims that a colonel delivered photos of flying saucers to local businesses to stoke the flames, all in an effort, reportedly, to cover up what was really happening at Area 51.

“It really doesn't make a lot of sense,” Coulthart said. 

“We've known for years that disinformation is being used and that UFOs are often used as cover, but that doesn't explain the firsthand witnesses who say they have seen craft and that they have direct knowledge of the program.”

The Eastern Kentucky Ghost Squad recently brought its investigation team to Pikeville, focusing on local history and reported paranormal activity at sites including a museum and the courthouse.

Bobbie Wright, lead investigator and founder of the Eastern Kentucky Ghost Squad, is clear about the group's mission. 

“We don't just focus on the paranormal,” she said. “We also love sharing the history of the places that we go,” Wright said.

The squad includes Wright's husband Ray Wright, Freddie Lewis, Tonya Easterling and her husband Michael Carter Easterling and Jeremy Phipps, all from Morgan County.

The group recently brought its equipment and curiosity to Pikeville, a location Wright said she had researched for some time. 

“I've been looking for places in Pikeville for a while, because it's not very far from home and there's a rich history in Pikeville,” she said.

Wright's team previously visited Dils Cemetery. 

“We just wanted to learn more about it,” she said, explaining that her search often starts online. “I do a lot of research. I'll Google places, historic places and things like that. I'll go through all types of videos, YouTubes.” 

That' is how she found a video featuring Brandon Kirk, who currently manages the Big Sandy Heritage Center museum.

“I reached out to Brandon and he was interested, but he had to talk to the board. We emailed back and forth for a while and then it finally worked out to where we could go,” Wright said.

The group's first visit to Pikeville included Wright, Jeremy Phipps and Ray Wright. 

“We went just to talk to Brandon, and he showed us the museum and the courthouse,” Wright said. The visit took a turn when they began using their Spirit Talker device. 

“The name Henry came across,” she said. “At the time, we didn't pay attention to it. Later, I was cutting a video for a promo, and that's when it clicked. I heard the name Henry while I was watching the video, and I'm like, wait a minute, that's familiar.”

She continued, “I went back through my pictures from the museum, and sure as the world, Henry was relevant. It was Elijah Henry Hall, the last man who was supposedly legally hanged in Pikeville for murdering his brother.”

Returning that night with the full crew, Wright said, “We had rim pods, millimeters, K2s, cat balls and tripwire. We had everything.” 

Sam Hatcher, a storyteller for the museum, guided the group through the rooms and provided historical context. 

“When he was telling us the history, I started feeling something,” Wright said. “So I started turning on the equipment. And from get-go, we started having stuff happen. The trip wire went off. The rim pod went nuts in the deals room.”

The group uses Spirit Talker apps, which Wright explained as “a word generator and the spirits can use those apps to speak to us.”

Beyond investigating, Wright said she also makes promotional videos for the locations they visit. 

“I do free promo videos for the places that we go to, to help more people find out about these places and hopefully visit and show support,” she said. “It's our thank you to the places that are kind enough to allow us to investigate.”

Wright's connection to the paranormal started early. 

“I grew up in a funeral home in West Liberty in Morgan County from the time I was six months old until I was 13. I grew up around the dead. I always felt connected,” she said.

The Eastern Kentucky Ghost Squad formed after discovering they shared an interest in the paranormal at work.

The group has investigated various locations, preferring sites that haven't been widely explored.

“We don't like to go to places that have been overdone. The places we like haven't been explored before. We want to share different stories that haven't been heard,” Wright said.

Asked about skeptics, Wright said, “A lot of people are scared of this stuff, so they try to explain it away. They'll say it's dust or a bug. That fear makes people want to ignore it.” She added, “But when people come with us and see what happens, they usually leave as believers. The spirits especially like to mess with skeptics.”

Wright said her group never charges for house calls. 

“We do free house calls. We don't charge for that. And on our investigations, we like to take people with us. If someone wants to go with us, we usually try to.” Wright said.

Wright emphasized that the work is as much about history and healing as it is about the unexplained. 

“The paranormal is not something to be afraid of. It really isn't. It's just our past that's wanting to finish the story,” she said.

The squad plans to return to Pikeville and is seeking new connections for future investigations. “We would love to do more in Pikeville, especially with the Hatfields, McCoys and the Dils. There's a lot more to be discovered in Pikeville with the paranormal,” Wright said.

For information about investigations or to join the group on a visit, Wright encourages people to contact her. 

“Check out our YouTube at Eastern Ky. Ghost Squad, like and subscribe,” she said. Or the group can be reached directly by phone at (606) 359-4765.

Their next investigation will take place in Prestonsburg at the Samuel May House, set up by Sam Hatcher.

“We try to show people the other side and show them it's not always something to be afraid of,” Wright said.

A Cult Classic Meets Cult Comfort

Crocs has never shied away from wild collaborations, but their upcoming Ghostbusters-themed clogs might just be the most charged release yet—literally. Bridging iconic cinema with playful style, this limited-edition footwear drop pulls inspiration straight from the supernatural archives of the Ghostbusters franchise. For fans of proton packs, ghouls, and glow-in-the-dark slime, this crossover offers a perfect fusion of nostalgia and novelty.

At first glance, the Ghostbusters Classic Clog blends in with a tan base reminiscent of the legendary flight suits. But take a closer look, and things quickly get weird—in the best possible way. Ghost traps, glowing green goo, and even a Slimer cameo turn this otherwise casual silhouette into something that feels like it was pulled from the containment unit at Ghostbusters HQ.

Details That Bring the Chaos to Life

Crocs didn't just slap a logo on this and call it a day. Instead, the brand has poured cinematic detail into every inch of the clog. Glow-in-the-dark ectoplasm drips across the toe box, giving each step a radioactive vibe. Slimer himself makes a messy exit on the left shoe, while a miniature ghost trap hangs from the right like a warning sign—or a trophy, depending on how many poltergeists you've caught lately.

In true Ghostbusters fashion, this drop includes more than just flair. There's function too. The left clog features a touch-activated sound chip that plays the power-up effect from the movies. It's a clever way to inject a bit of performance into everyday wear—and a feature that's sure to turn heads whether you're at a Halloween party or the cereal aisle.

And of course, no Ghostbuster would be complete without their name tag. Crocs includes interchangeable Velcro labels for all four original team members: Venkman, Zeddemore, Stantz, and Spengler. Whether you're a sarcastic skeptic or a gadget-obsessed genius, you can literally step into your favorite Ghostbuster's shoes.

Built for Fans, Styled for the Bold

This isn't the first time Crocs has collaborated with a pop culture heavyweight, but the Ghostbusters design takes things a step further. It's not only steeped in deep-cut references—it's also surprisingly wearable. The muted tan makes the green slime and colorful Jibbitz pop, and the overall aesthetic feels balanced despite the chaotic theme. The clogs even retain Crocs' famed comfort, thanks to their lightweight construction and cushioned Croslite footbed.

The adjustable heel straps—dubbed “sports mode” by Crocs fans—carry the classic “no ghost” emblem, doubling down on the visual storytelling. Even the warning label on the backstay nods to the in-universe tech design of Ghostbusters equipment. The whole product feels like something Egon would've prototyped on a lunch break.

A Timely Tribute with Halloween Energy

The timing of this release couldn't be better. With Halloween creeping around the corner and the Ghostbusters franchise continually finding new fans through reboots and reruns, this drop arrives with built-in anticipation. It taps into decades of cultural love while offering something tangible and wearable for today's audiences.

What's more, it works across age groups. Lifelong fans of the original films will appreciate the accuracy and humor. Meanwhile, younger wearers will get to experience the joy of light-up sounds and spooky slime without needing a deep archive of movie trivia. It's a win-win for style and storytelling.

Where to Grab the Ghostbusters Crocs

Set for release on Crocs.com and select retailers, this collaboration is expected to sell out quickly. Between the tactile features, custom Jibbitz, and glow-in-the-dark effects, there's a strong chance these will become collector's items. Whether you're looking to elevate your Halloween costume, flex some nerdy style, or just want the most haunted footwear on the market, this drop deserves your attention.

With fandom-fueled energy and a touch of gooey flair, Crocs and Ghostbusters have summoned a shoe that's equal parts quirky and clever. Just don't be surprised if people ask, “Who you gonna call?” when they spot you wearing them.

Researchers have decided that a potentially good way to prepare for future contact with extraterrestrial beings is by studying…whale bubbles.

No, it's not a joke—researchers from the SETI Institute, the University of California, Davis (UC Davis), and several partner institutions recently published a paper describing humpback whales blowing bubble rings during friendly interactions with humans. While this might not seem like a shocking action, the behavior provides insight into non-human intelligence, with important implications for our ongoing search for alien life.

“Because of current limitations on technology, an important assumption of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is that extraterrestrial intelligence and life will be interested in making contact and so target human receivers,” Laurance Doyle, SETI Institute scientist and co-author of the study published last month in the journal Marine Mammal Science, said in an institute statement. “This important assumption is certainly supported by the independent evolution of curious behavior in humpback whales.”

While researchers had previously documented humpback whales creating bubble nets to capture prey and using bubbles to vie for female whales, the study examines the cetaceans blowing bubble rings during amicable interactions with humans. Doyle and his colleagues studied 12 bubble ring events involving 11 whales and 39 rings, behaviors that may represent playfulness or an attempt at communication. Jodi Frediani, a co-lead author of the study and marine wildlife photographer affiliated with UC Davis, explained that humpback whales frequently interact with boats and even swimmers in a curious, friendly way.

AI Is Deciphering Animal Speech. Should We Try to Talk Back?

“Humpback whales live in complex societies, are acoustically diverse, use bubble tools and assist other species being harassed by predators,” added Fred Sharpe, also a co-lead author of the study from UC Davis. “Now, akin to a candidate signal [from extraterrestrial life], we show they are blowing bubble rings in our direction in an apparent attempt to playfully interact, observe our response, and/or engage in some form of communication.”

Chances are that, should we ever establish contact with extraterrestrials, their form of communication won't be what we expect. By analyzing intelligent nonhuman communication systems—such as whales blowing bubbles while engaging with boats and people—scientists can broaden their understanding of unfamiliar forms of communication and refine what we should look for in our search for life beyond Earth. The goal is to be better prepared if or when contact occurs. Simply put, whale bubbles can be an analog for an alien language.

Their approach is the latest in a host of efforts to simulate extraterrestrial scenarios and hypothesize how we might ultimately come into contact with an alien species.

The CIA's best-kept secret - revealed in a report by Ingo Swann confirming extraterrestrial life on the moon - they look like humans

Of the two hundred theories about the creation of the universe, there is one that is regaining strength on social media… Aliens on the Moon. Yes, and moreover, revealed by a secret CIA report, those who are always very quiet…

This story is based on a narrative that emerged in 1998 from Ingo Swann, a famous “psychic” who claimed to have participated in a “remote viewing” program sponsored by the CIA. According to Swann, his visions revealed intelligent beings, similar to humans, who lived on the lunar surface… and who were aware of being observed!

Are there scientific proofs? No. Do we love these theories? YES! So, we're going to tell you what this supposed secret CIA report says about how the aliens of the Earth live… Another government conspiracy!

Ingo Swann was a popular artist and psychic in the 70s and 80s for his participation in “remote viewing” experiments. Supposedly, this psychic had special abilities to see places and objects at a distance (without being nearby or even knowing them…) According to his 1998 account, during a session funded by the CIA, he detected artificial structures and intelligent beings on the Moon, and claimed they knew they were being observed! Are we surprised?!

Of course, to this day, there is no verifiable evidence of these encounters… Although we'd love that, we're not going to fool anyone…

And well, we don't want to add more fuel to the fire, but… How much has NASA investigated the Moon and found nothing…? And if they did but are hiding it from us? Well, that's the theory on which all the believers of this story rely.

Dramatic music… Ooh, the question! This theory believes that the CIA has spent years hiding reports about life on the Moon because the CIA declassified some documents… And it is believed that some of these files refer to other supposed observations of aliens in places as varied as Saturn's moons, Mount Hayes in Alaska, and certain regions of South America and Africa.

We keep going because an even more surprising file recounts a supposed confrontation between Soviet troops and alien beings after a UFO was shot down!! (And they believe it!!!) But neither the authenticity nor the context of these documents is clear, leaving lots of room for speculation…

NASA has explored the Moon for over half a century, and to this day no credible sign of alien bases or lunar civilizations has been found. Scientists consider these stories part of the long tradition of myths and conspiracies surrounding space, so let's say they're used to living with these conspiracy theories.

And well, we're so eager for extraterrestrial life to exist that some people cling to whatever they can… For the believers, the lack of a definitive refutation adds more mystery to the matter (for you too, right?). But for the sceptics, it's simply another episode of humanity's fascination with aliens.

Let's see… we choose to believe because we love the mystery, but the reality is that there is no scientific proof to support this idea (not even the CIA has ever documented anything like this). Everything points to a tale turned into myth.

Supposed aliens on the Moon… a mix of rumours, somewhat ambiguous official documents, and the incredible stories of Ingo Swann (which we're leaving here below so you can take a look). But… no one has stepped up to confirm or deny these theories… That's the magic of these topics! Who knows, maybe these rumours end up being real…

The Supernatural spinoff, The Winchesters, made one crucial mistake that doomed the show from the start. Premiering in 2005, Supernatural ran for an impressive 15 seasons, developing a passionate fan base along the way. As many know, the show centers on brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) Winchester as they travel across the country ""saving people and hunting things."" But what begins as a cross-country monster hunt soon turns into a battle to save the world, as Sam and Dean face off against demons and angels alike.

Almost immediately after Supernatural's divisive series finale, speculation began on whether the show would ever return. Before long, Jensen Ackles announced that he and his wife, Daneel Ackles, were working on a Supernatural prequel following a young Mary Campbell (Meg Donnelly) and John Winchester (Drake Rodger). However, when the first trailer dropped for The Winchesters, fans were quick to point out that the story didn't match up with what had been revealed in Supernatural. The Winchesters' finale explained the reason behind this, but the show may have been more successful if it had revealed the truth at the beginning.

Dean Winchester returns in The Winchesters series finale, revealing that the events of the show have been set in an alternate universe. The Mary and John that viewers had been following for 12 episodes were not the same ones who gave birth to the Sam and Dean Winchester of Supernatural. Supernatural had already introduced the multiverse years before, revealing the existence of different versions of beloved characters. Additionally, with its finale reveal, The Winchesters explores what happened to Dean after his death in the Supernatural finale.

Supernatural developed a complex mythology throughout its fifteen seasons, and sometimes the show broke its own timeline or altered its own canon.

After Dean arrived in Heaven, he spent some time cruising in his 1967 Chevrolet Impala (affectionately nicknamed ""Baby""). During this time, Dean began exploring the multiverse, searching for a version of his family that got a happy ending. Along the way, Dean discovers a threat to the entire multiverse, including the universe where Sam is still living out the rest of his life. This motivates Dean (and Baby) to help John and Mary save the day, giving the eldest Winchester brother one last chance to save the world and providing an opening for him to return in the future.

 The Winchesters finale recontextualizes the entire season, turning it into more of an epilogue for Dean than a prequel to Supernatural. Unfortunately, this revelation came too late, as many viewers had already given up on The Winchesters by the time of its finale. Despite assurances from Jensen Ackles and the show's creators that The Winchesters would not contradict Supernatural canon, it seemed to confirm fans' worst fears. While the finale ultimately made up for some of The Winchesters' failings, the show likely would have been more successful if it had revealed its big twist in episode one.

Although Dean appears in The Winchesters' first episode (and narrates much of the series), the scene does not reveal that the show's events occur in an alternate universe. This reveal would have established from the beginning how the show fit within Supernatural's established canon and would have given viewers more reasons to watch. Dean's death in Supernatural's finale left many fans unhappy, and it would have been in The Winchesters' best interest to advertise immediately that this was a continuation of Dean's story.

Sam and Dean Winchester were always the heart of Supernatural, and they made even the mediocre episodes of the show worth watching. Meanwhile, the story of Mary and John Winchester had already been explored in Supernatural and was not something most fans had asked for. Giving Dean a larger presence in The Winchesters' earliest episodes would have helped draw people into the show. It also would have been fun to see Dean pop up throughout the season, maybe narrating the differences between this universe and what he knew of his real parents.

I enjoyed The Winchesters more in hindsight after watching the finale, but I understand why some Supernatural fans bailed before they made it that far.

Alternate universe stories can undoubtedly be fun, but The Winchesters took way too long to reveal that this was the kind of story it was telling. I enjoyed The Winchesters more in hindsight after watching the finale, but I understand why some Supernatural fans bailed before they made it that far. Ultimately, The Winchesters would have been much more interesting if it had been clearly set up as an alternate universe series depicting a version of John and Mary Winchester who got a happy ending.

Washington DC's PSYOP returns June 13th with Defector, their third EP and arguably their most musically focused release to date. Dropping via local tape label What You See Is What You Get with distro through Kill Yellow Fever Records, the six-track cassette continues their blend of old-school hardcore punk and d-beat with streaks of doom, post-hardcore, and grind.

Defector by PsyOpDefector by PsyOp

Recorded by Matt Michel at Viva Studio and mastered by Will Killingsworth at Dead Air, Defector strips the fat and goes for the throat.



It's been over two years since their last release, and that time was used to sharpen both message and execution. “We've gotten through some false starts and lineup changes but we feel the finished work sets out our most musically tight release yet,” the band states. “We tried to stay more to our roots on this of old-school hardcore punk and d-beat but threw in a touch of doom or a blasty section here and there.”

Thematically, Defector doesn't waste a second. From track one, PSYOP drops listeners into a reality shaped by surveillance, disinformation, and scorched-earth politics. Their lyrics lay out a vision of a collapsing country “ravaged by corporate greed, environmental destruction and religious extremism,” and they don't hedge.

On Last Season, the band conjures a world of droughts and dead oceans. Revolutionary Guard sees vocalist Danial K reckoning with his own Muslim upbringing while criticizing the role of fundamentalism—whether Islamic, Christian, or Zionist—in perpetuating violence and false promises.

The EP's centerpiece is Psychological Operations, a track that PSYOP describes as their self-titled-in-spirit song. “We wanted to do our own spin on a self-titled song that captures the main vibe of PSYOP: how it feels to live in an imperialist surveillance state plagued by disinformation and propaganda.”

Built collaboratively from a bass riff, the song piles on side-to-side parts, breakdowns, and gang vocals. Its lyrics are rooted in historical precedent: “CIA psychological warfare campaigns that the US has used to wreak havoc in Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East; and the war on terror,” they explain. “We grew up in a post-9/11 era of reduced civil liberties, drone strikes, and regime changes that set the stage for the current nightmare we find ourselves in.”

 

 

A post shared by Break Free Fest (@breakfreefest)



The EP's cover art comes courtesy of Jeff Poleon (Quarantine, The Slads), underlining the band's connection to broader punk and DIY networks. For the physical release, PSYOP teamed up with KYF Records—a label they admire not just for its growing roster, but for its political commitments. “Their label's commitment to amplifying AAPI and POC voices in the hardcore scene is something we truly value and connect with, as a band partially with South and East Asian backgrounds that have worked on increasing representation in the wider scene.”

 

 

A post shared by PSYOP (@psyopdc)



PSYOP will play day two of Break Free Fest in Philly, followed by a DC release show on June 21st with Pilau and No Model—both of whom will also be dropping a split.

A Northeast tour runs from July 30 to August 3, hitting mostly DIY spots in New York and New Jersey. “We'll be playing everything from guerrilla underpass shows to more traditional stages supporting great bands like HIRS Collective and Body Farm.”

Permanent Underclass by PsyOpPermanent Underclass by PsyOp

For PSYOP, hardcore punk is still a weapon. “We're big believers in the power of DIY to unite, spark joy, and speak out against the many injustices of those in power,” they say. In DC, a city they admit is “tough to make art in,” they namecheck a thriving scene made up of grindcore, screamo, youth crew, and hardcore bands holding their ground across basements, streets, and festivals.

Iran's nuclear chief says the recent remarks by the head of the UN atomic agency about the Islamic Republic's nuclear facilities are void of technical and legal validity, while also chiming in with Zionist psychological operations against Tehran.

Mohammad Eslami, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), made the comments in a televised interview on Tuesday, addressing remarks made by Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

“Mr. Grossi's remarks lack technical and legal aspect,” the Iranian official said, describing the IAEA chief's discourse as totally being the product of “the psychological and political operations that the Zionist regime [of Israel] has been performing” against the Islamic Republic.

He said by passing the remarks, Grossi had clearly shown “his [true] character,” and proven to be among those that have been waging psyops against Iran for long.

Eslami was referring to Grossi's interview with i24NEWS, an Israeli TV channel, in which the latter had said the Israeli regime could not “destroy” Iran's nuclear facilities with “a single surgical strike. ""Disrupting them (the facilities) would require overwhelming and devastating force,” the IAEA chief had also said.

The Iranian nuclear chief said Grossi had issued the remarks, despite lacking all jurisdiction to comment on such issues. Eslami noted that the international law and precautions that concerned such matters essentially robbed the IAEA director general of any entitlement to intervene in affairs of such nature.

Grossi had also said, “Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon at this moment,” but claimed that “it has the material” to make one, echoing the Israeli regime's and its Western allies' unfounded allegations about, what the accusing sides have described as, Iran's so-called “diversion” towards obtaining nuclear arms or its intention to develop one.

The campaign has, most recently, manifested itself in the form of the IAEA Board of Governors issuing yet another anti-Iranian resolution amid Western and Israeli pressure.

The campaign rages on, while the Islamic Republic is the most-vetted member of the IAEA, with the agency having found no evidence in support of the alleged “diversion.”

Tehran, itself, has also categorically ruled out the prospect of either pursuing, obtaining, or maintaining nuclear arms in line with moral and religious guidelines.

Grossi had, however, additionally, alleged that the Islamic Republic harbored a “determination” to develop such weapons, adding that likely Israeli military aggression against the country could “potentially have an amalgamating effect, solidifying Iran's determination.”

He had also pointed to the Israeli regime's repeated threats to use military aggression against Iran's nuclear facilities, alleging that the threats meant that “the Iranian thing has incredible potential to become catastrophic.""

Eslami, however, denounced Grossi for resorting to “expressing concern for Israel,” a regime that, unlike Iran, was a possessor of nuclear arms, and a non-member of the IAEA's Safeguards Agreement that would not brook any oversight of its nuclear sites.

Adding to his comments, the Iranian official regretted that the IAEA chief's remarks indicated that “international organizations [such as the UN nuclear agency] are a tool in the hands of dominant powers as well as being totally subject to Israeli influence.”

On the other hand, Iran's attitude of outright opposition to the Israeli regime's atrocities, including those committed against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, proved that the Islamic Republic's view of various nations' rights in the face of foreign aggression was a “realistic one,” Eslami concluded.

Before May, most people in Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s so-called Make America Healthy Again movement likely weren't familiar with Leland Lehrman, a self-styled media entrepreneur, anti-vaccine activist, and former teahouse owner who once unsuccessfully ran for the US Senate in New Mexico.

Lehrman claimed Israel is “a leading candidate for architect of the 9/11 attacks.” 

Last month, however, Lehrman was named executive director of the MAHA Institute, a new advocacy organization that aims to amplify “MAHA wins for President Trump, Secretary Kennedy, and the Cabinet,” advise elected officials on the movement's agenda, and “find and attract” allies to work in government. The group shares key leaders with MAHA PAC, the new name of American Values 2024, a fundraising vehicle that raised $50 million in support of Kennedy's presidential candidacy. While the MAHA Institute only launched in May, its ties to RFK Jr. are close enough that at its founding conference Lehrman was the first to reveal that the secretary would announce the government would stop recommending COVID vaccines for pregnant people and children. 

But even less well-known is Lehrman's long history of promoting antisemitic and extreme conspiracy theories, as detailed in a new report from the Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights, an organization which studies extremism and the far right. The IREHR found that in the mid 2000s, Lehrman spread conspiracies about the September 11 attacks and extensively touted the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an outrageous antisemitic forgery that purports to document a secret meeting where Jews plotted world domination and which has been debunked for over 100 years.

Lehrman wrote multiple articles outlining his belief in the Protocols on the website of Jeff Rense, a far-right radio host who's often given airtime to Nazis, racists, and assorted antisemites. In 2005, Lehrman sat down for a long interview with Rense in which he described “high-level Jewish Illuminists, or Lucifer worshipers” who have “most certainly collaborated with the Lucifer worshipers in all the other sects like Nazism, like high-level Freemasonry. They have most certainly collaborated in the development of this New World Order plan.”

“The reason why the Protocols of Zion is important is because it is a terrifically well-elucidated encapsulation of all the methods and techniques that have been used to bring about the New World Order,” Lehrman added. 

According to the IREHR's report, Lehrman is the great-grandson of the founder of the Rite-Aid corporation. His father, the investment banker Lewis E. Lehrman, is from a Jewish family, although he publicly converted to Catholicism four decades ago. His mother is Episcopalian. In his first piece for Rense's site in 2005, Lehrman described himself as “an American citizen of Jewish heritage concerned about the methods and doctrines that the criminal leadership of the Jewish and Zionist hierarchy have promoted worldwide.” 

Lehrman acknowledged receiving a request for comment from Mother Jones, but he did not answer questions about his past writings and statements before publication. He did not say whether he still holds such views.

Mark Gorton (the millionaire creator of LimeWire) and Tony Lyons (the founder of Skyhorse Publishing, which releases conspiratorial and anti-vaccine books, including some written by Kennedy) are the cofounders of MAHA PAC, and are also the co-presidents of the MAHA Institute. 

Lehrman has claimed “high-level Jewish…Lucifer worshipers”  helped  develop a “New World Order plan.”  

When asked about Lehrman's past statements, Lyons replied with a brief statement. “We're being asked to comment on an accusation of anti-semitism,” he wrote. “Five of the six most senior people at The MAHA Institute are Jewish, but that shouldn't get in the way of a good hit piece.” Lyons did not respond to followup questions about whether he'd read Lehrman's writings on the Protocols, or whether he was counting Lehrman among the institute's senior Jewish staff.

HHS did not respond to requests for comment, but on his LinkedIn page, Lehrman details a series of roles that have drawn him nearer to Kennedy and his inner circle. He says he began volunteering for RFK's presidential run in 2023, before being “hired to do research and provide ideas for Bobby and the campaign on policy issues, news briefs, and tweets.”

For the last eight months, according to his LinkedIn, he's worked as a volunteer and then as a consultant for MAHA Action, a separate group led until recently by anti-vaccine activist Del Bigtree, the former communications director of RFK's 2024 campaign. “I assisted Stefanie Spear, Chief of Staff to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. I engaged with Bobby's policy correspondence… I worked with the team to advance both MAHA policies and our candidates for government positions,” Lehrman wrote. The page also says he began a position in March as the executive director of the obscure Freedom for America Fund, whose website claims it will source “healthy, high-integrity Americans” to work in the Trump administration to “promote health and freedom.” The organization lists no contact information, and it is unclear if Lehrman still holds that position. 

In Lehrman's first article on Rense's site, he argued that the Protocols were legitimate—a notion debunked not long after they first appeared around 1903. In the article, Lehrman claimed he was not denigrating all Jews, explaining that “those ‘Jews' who play the world domination game are in effect no longer Jewish by religion in that their strategy is in direct contradiction with the Ten Commandments, the real pillar of the Hebrew religion.”

Lehrman also promoted 9/11 conspiracy theories, writing that during Dennis Kucinich's 2004 Democratic presidential campaign—which Lehrman said he “ran” in Santa Fe—he “met a former Captain in US Army Intelligence who was able to substantially add to my understanding of the 9/11 Inside Job. Very substantially.” He also baselessly tied the assault to Israel, writing in July 2005 for a defunct site called Progressive Convergence that Mossad, the country's intelligence service, was “a leading candidate for architect of the 9/11 attacks.” 

Lehrman has praised extremist texts as recently as April.

During his unsuccessful attempt to become New Mexico Democrats' 2008 Senate nominee, Lehrman made reopening a commission on September 11 a major priority, as he continued to promote conspiracy theories about the attacks, now claiming that then-vice president Dick Cheney was responsible.

“It's only because Americans are so terrified and so easily propagandized that this unbelievably bad conspiracy theory that the government has put forward about 19 hijackers and the guy in a cave in Afghanistan even warrants mention,” he told the Santa Fe Reporter in December 2007. 

After leaving New Mexico, Lehrman settled with his family in upstate New York, where he participated in anti-vaccine activism before, with the emergence of Covid, becoming intensely suspicious of lockdown measures and vaccines that target the virus. In his Substack bio, Lehrman presents himself as having decided to stay out of politics and writing until, as he put it in a nod to Orwell, “the COVERT-1984 Plandemonium started,” and he “knew it was time to begin again in earnest.” 

As the IREHR report points out, Lehrman has praised extremist texts within the last several months. In April, he attended a conference hosted by the Brownstone Institute, which was founded to promote anti-Covid lockdown ideas. In an interview during the event, he hailed the 1955 book Pawns in the Game by Canadian antisemite and conspiracy theorist William Guy Carr as “a very, very controversial book, but it's also an important one,” praising it for how it “uncovered the thread of Free Masonic activity.” According to extremist researcher Chip Berlet, Carr claimed “an age-old Jewish Illuminati banking conspiracy used radio-transmitted mind control on behalf of Lucifer to construct a one world government.”

So far, the MAHA Institute has done little public-facing work besides its May 15 launch event, which was meant to preview the MAHA Commission Report, a Trump administration document which turned out to cite nonexistent studies. The speakers that day included Calley Means, a special government employee and Kennedy advisor who previously worked on his presidential campaign, and Sara Brenner, an FDA official who recently served as the agency's acting commissioner. Shortly after the event, the organization, which says it is collecting resumes for MAHA-friendly candidates to work in the Trump administration, posted to X about battling unnamed enemies within the government.

“Right now, tens of thousands of D.C. bureaucrats are working to subvert the MAHA Agenda,” a May 22 post declared. “That ends now.”

Lyons' statement gave no indication that Lehrman's writings and claims will affect his standing at the MAHA Institute, but antisemitism has not been a barrier to serving within the Trump administration itself. And while Kennedy's HHS is part of a joint federal task force which claims to investigate antisemitism in universities, Kennedy himself once claimed that COVID was a bioweapon designed to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, and multiple Trump cabinet members have ties to antisemitic and far-right extremists.

Patrick Djordjevic 

(NewsNation) — Could the whole UFO culture have been fueled, intentionally, by a Pentagon disinformation campaign that spanned decades?

Not according to NewsNation special correspondent Ross Coulthart. 

“I think the hilarious thing about this, it's such a joke this Wall Street Journal article, because it's effectively admitting what we've known for years,” Coulthart said on “Elizabeth Vargas Reports.” “Which is that there are people, gatekeepers to the secret about this legacy UAP program, who have been lying to and deceiving the American public for years.”

A new report from The Wall Street Journal alleges the U.S. military knew that UFOs weren't of alien origin but purposely spread that rumor for decades to help them hide top-secret programs from the public and America's enemies.

The article raises the question of whether some of the biggest names to come forward in recent years, like Pentagon whistleblower David Grusch, could have been fed fake information about UFOs and top-secret UFO programs.

Per the article, the military was testing a top-secret stealth fighter in Area 51 during the Cold War. The Journal claims that a colonel delivered photos of flying saucers to local businesses to stoke the flames, all in an effort, reportedly, to cover up what was really happening at Area 51.

“It really doesn't make a lot of sense,” Coulthart said. 

“We've known for years that disinformation is being used and that UFOs are often used as cover, but that doesn't explain the firsthand witnesses who say they have seen craft and that they have direct knowledge of the program.”

Scott Bessent, US treasury secretary

A growing chorus of advisers inside and outside the Trump administration are pushing another name to serve as the next chair of the Federal Reserve: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

President Donald Trump said Friday he would name a successor “very soon” to replace Jerome Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May 2026. The small list of candidates under consideration has included Kevin Warsh, a former Fed official whom Trump interviewed for the Treasury secretary role in November, according to people familiar with the matter.

As Senate Republicans debate President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful bill"", a lesser-known provision from the House-approved package could make it harder to claim a low-income tax credit.

If enacted as written, the House measure in the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" would require precertification of each qualifying child for filers claiming the so-called earned income tax credit, or EITC, starting in 2028.

Under current law, taxpayers claim the EITC on their tax return — including Schedule EIC for qualifying children.

The provision aims to ""avoid duplicative and other erroneous claims,"" according to the bill's text. But policy experts say the new rules would burden eligible filers, who may forgo the EITC as a result. The measure could also delay tax refunds for those filers, particularly amid IRS cutbacks, experts say.

""You're going to flood the IRS with all these [EITC] documents,"" said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. ""It's just not clear how they're going to process all this information.""

Holtzblatt, who has pushed to simplify the EITC for decades, wrote a critique of the proposed precertification last week.

""This is not a new idea, but was previously considered, studied and rejected for very good reasons,"" Greg Leiserson, a senior fellow at the Tax Law Center at New York University Law, wrote about the proposal in late May.

Studies during the George W. Bush administration found an EITC precertification process reduced EITC claims for eligible filers, Leiserson wrote. During the study, precertification also yielded a lower return on investment compared to existing EITC enforcement, such as audits, he wrote.

One of the key benefits of the EITC is the tax break is ""refundable,"" meaning you can still claim the credit and get a refund with zero taxes owed.

That's valuable for lower earners who don't have a tax bill, experts say.

To qualify, you need ""earned income,"" or wages from work. The income phase-outs depend on your ""qualifying children,"" based on four IRS tests.

""Eligibility is complicated,"" and residency requirements for qualifying children often cause errors, said Holtzblatt with the Tax Policy Center. 

For 2025, the tax break is worth up to $8,046 for eligible families. You can claim the maximum EITC with adjusted gross income up to $61,555 for single filers and $68,675 for married couples filing jointly. These phase-outs apply to families with three or more children.

As of December 2024, about 23 million workers received the EITC for tax year 2022, according to the IRS. But 1 in 5 eligible taxpayers don't claim the tax break, the agency estimates.

Nine Democratic Senators last week voiced concerns about the House-approved EITC changes in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.

If enacted, the updates would ""further complicate the EITC's existing challenges and make it more difficult to claim,"" the lawmakers wrote.

Higher earners are more likely to face an audit, but EITC claimants have a 5.5 times higher audit rate than the rest of U.S. filers, partly due to improper payments, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.

The proposed EITC change, among other House provisions, still need Senate approval, and it's unclear how the measure could change.

However, under the reconciliation process, Senate Republicans only need a simple majority to advance the bill.

California Governor Gavin Newsom should be arrested over the violence engulfing LA, Donald Trump has declared.

On Sunday, Tom Homan, the president's border tsar, suggested Mr Newsom was at risk of being arrested if he thwarted ICE officers attempting to arrest illegal migrants in the state.

“I would do it if I were Tom,” Mr Trump said on Monday.

Speaking about Mr Newsom, he continued: “He's a nice guy, but he's grossly incompetent. Everybody knows.”

“The people that are causing the problem are professional agitators, they're insurrectionists. They're bad people, they should be in jail,” Mr Trump went on to state.

Mr Newsom shot back, writing on X: “The president of the United States just called for the arrest of a sitting governor.

“This is a day I hoped I would never see in America. I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican this is a line we cannot cross as a nation — this is an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.”

Mr Newsom has dared Mr Homan to make good on his threat, telling MSNBC: “Come and arrest me. Let's just get it over with, tough guy. I don't give a damn.”

“He's a tough guy. Why doesn't he do that? He knows where to find me,” Mr Newsom added.

Masked protesters in Los Angeles smashed and torched self-driving electric cars during a third day of volatile demonstrations on Sunday sparked by immigration raids in the city.

On Monday afternoon, hundreds of demonstrators descended on the Federal Building in the downtown area where they threw water bottles and officers responded by firing rubber and non-lethal bullets.

Police also shot flash bangs into the crowd, sending protesters running away into the side streets.

The tension had been building for hours but aside from a few fights. the crowds were largely peaceful.

National Guard troops and LAPD officers dressed in riot gear lined the entrance of the building as protesters stood in the 24C (75F) heat waving Mexican flags and chanting “free them all”.

Protesters climbed traffic lights and on top of bus stops as teenagers sprayed graffiti on the walls of the building.

Snipers were stationed on the roof of the building and a rifle could be seen pointing at the crowd.

As the tension continued to build, cars driving past honked their horns and motorcyclists revved their engines in support of the protesters.

Late on Monday, the White House said it was deploying 700 US Marines to Los Angeles and another 2,000 National Guard Troops.

Mr Newsom responded saying: “US Marines have served honourably across multiple wars in defence of democracy.

“They shouldn't be deployed on American soil facing their own countrymen to fulfil the deranged fantasy of a dictatorial president. This is un-American.”

Mr Newsom is suing the Trump administration over the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops which he called “an illegal act, an immoral act, an unconstitutional act”.

In a court filing on Monday night, California claimed that the president's deployment of the National Guard violated state sovereignty and federal law.

Mr Newsom also accused Mr Trump of deploying soldiers without food or water.

I was just informed Trump is deploying another 2,000 Guard troops to L.A.The first 2,000? Given no food or water. Only approx. 300 are deployed — the rest are sitting, unused, in federal buildings without orders.This isn't about public safety. It's about stroking a dangerous…

Demonstrators protesting against federal immigration raids continued to clash with police who fired rubber bullets and tear gas while being hurled with bricks and stones.

Several journalists were injured during the crackdown, including an Australian presenter who was shot in the leg while reporting from downtown.

Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, appeared at odds with the LAPD chief, who said the force was under-resourced and overwhelmed.

“He has received that support from the sheriff's department and from other police departments, and so I do not believe that he was describing a situation where we cannot get it under control here,” she told CNN.

An LAPD officer told The Telegraph he thinks there would be a “critical incident” at one of the demonstrations and citywide protests would erupt.

“I think someone is going to try and shoot a cop,” he said.

“I think people are inspired by vigilantes like Luigi Mangione,” he added.

He added that he believed the protests would escalate quickly in the coming days.

Asked about the video of a police officer shooting an Australian journalist with a rubber bullet, he insisted police do not usually direct fire at the press.

Mr Newsom's confrontation with the president is the latest in a string of disagreements he has shared with Mr Trump, who has nicknamed the governor “Newscum”.

The pair clashed earlier this year when Mr Trump blamed Mr Newsom for the California wildfires that destroyed thousands of homes and called for his resignation.

Juan Ramón de la Fuente, the Mexican foreign affairs minister, said 42 Mexicans had been detained in the riots, four of which were already returned to Mexico.

“We do not agree with violent actions as a form of protest,” Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican president, said.

“Burning police cars appears to be more an act of provocation than of resistance. We condemn violence, no matter where it comes from. We call on the Mexican community to act pacifically and not allow itself to be provoked.”

At least 56 people were arrested over the weekend, including a person accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail at an officer.

Some of the people arrested include a Vietnamese gang member with a murder conviction and a Mexican national with convictions for child molestation, according to the White House.

Cuong Chanh Phan, a Vietnamese national and known gang member with a conviction for second-degree murder, was detained in LA over the weekend. He was arrested in 1994 after participating in a gang-affiliated cold-blooded murder of two teenagers at a graduation party.

Eswin Uriel Castro, who had previously been deported, was also detained. Castro was previously convicted for child molestation, being armed with a dangerous weapon and previous arrests for robbery and domestic violence.

Police also arrested Russell Gomez-Dzul, a Mexican national, for assaulting a federal officer during the riots.

Police declared all of downtown LA to be an unlawful assembly area on Sunday as officers geared up for another day of protests.

            China said that by the end of this year all tertiary level hospitals must offer epidural anesthesia during childbirth, a move it said would help promote a “friendly childbearing environment” for women.
    


            Tertiary hospitals – those with more than 500 beds – must provide epidural anesthesia services by 2025 while secondary hospitals – those containing more than 100 beds – must provide the services by 2027, China's National Health Commission (NHC) said in a statement last week.
    


            Authorities are struggling to boost birth rates in the world's second largest economy after China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024 with experts warning the downturn will worsen in the coming years.
    


            Around 30% of pregnant women in China receive anesthesia to relieve pain during childbirth, compared with more than 70% in some developed countries, the official China Daily said.
    


            The World Health Organization recommends epidurals for healthy pregnant women requesting pain relief and it is widely utilized in many countries around the world, including France, where around 82% of pregnant women opt to have one, and in the United States and Canada where more than 67% do.

            The move will “improve the comfort level and security of medical services” and “further enhance people's sense of happiness and promote a friendly childbearing environment,” the NHC said.
    


            A growing number of provinces across China are also beginning to include childbirth anesthesia costs as part of their medical insurance schemes to encourage more women to have children.



            High childcare costs as well as job uncertainty and a slowing economy have discouraged many young Chinese from getting married and starting a family.
    


            In June, health authorities in China's southwestern Sichuan province proposed to extend marriage leave up to 25 days and maternity leave up to 150 days, to help create a “fertility-friendly society.”

            When Sana Yousaf turned 17, she posted a video of her birthday celebrations to more than a million followers on TikTok.
    


            They saw her cutting a pink and cream cake beneath a matching balloon arch, the June breeze ruffling her long hair as she beamed against the backdrop of the cloud-covered Margalla Hills in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad.
    


            Less than 24 hours later, Sana was dead, a bullet through her chest and graphic images of her dead body going viral on Pakistani social media, outraging women across the country, who fear there are no safe spaces for them anymore – in reality, or online.
    


            Police have detained 22-year-old Umar Hayat, an unemployed man from the city of Faisalabad, over Sana's murder. Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, the Inspector General of Police of Islamabad, alleged Hayat “repeatedly attempted to contact” the teenager and killed her when she refused to respond. CNN has not been able to locate a legal representative for Hayat.
    


            Sana's father, Syed Yousaf Hassan, told CNN no words could convey the family's loss, and his daughter hadn't told him she was being harassed. “My daughter was braver than a son,” he said. “She didn't fear anything.”
    


            As Sana's family prepared for her funeral, disturbing comments started popping up on her TikTok and Instagram posts, most in Urdu, celebrating her killing. “Happy to see these things happening,” read one. Another stated, “My heart is happy today, I'm going to turn on music and dance with joy.”
    


            Under a picture of Sana wearing traditional Pakistani clothes covering her entire body, a comment said, “encouraging young women to seek attention or expose themselves can have serious negative consequences.”
    


            The Digital Rights Foundation (DRF), a women-led nonprofit that promotes online safety, said such rhetoric “dangerously links a woman's online presence or perceived morality to justifications for violence.”
    


            “This form of digital vigilantism contributes to a broader culture of victim-blaming, where abuse is normalized and accountability is shifted away from the perpetrator,” the DRF said in a report released soon after Sana's death.
    


            Alongside toxic online comments, rage has simmered among women across Pakistan, who are demanding justice for Sana, pointing to a crisis of masculinity in the South Asian nation.
    


            And Pakistan is far from alone in seeing heated debates over the prevalence of violence against women.
    


            Recent multiple murders in Latin America, including a Mexican influencer who was shot dead while livestreaming, has sparked indignation and highlighted the high rates of femicide across the continent.
    


            British miniseries“Adolescence” became a global hit this year with its raw depiction of the damage caused by online misogyny while a recent largescale Australia study found one in three men saying they have committed intimate partner violence at some point in their lives.
    


            Sana's TikTok content would be familiar to any teenager online. Her recent shorts included showing off her fashionwear, singing songs while driving, and filming a blowdry at the salon.
    


            But for prominent women's rights campaigners, Sana's death was the ultimate outcome of unrestricted online abuse of women in a patriarchal country.
    


            Amber Rahim Shamsi, a prominent journalist and Pakistan editor of a news digital platform, Nukta, says she was relentlessly harassed online in 2020 for a variety of issues, including her views on women's rights.
    


            “I have also been stalked online, and became fearful when my stalker started to send me mugs and mounted photos to my office. I am just one example among millions of women from all walks of life. Most don't have the privilege or social safety nets to protect themselves,” Shamsi told CNN.
    


            Shamsi agrees that there is a crisis in masculinity, “especially in how it plays out in our digital spaces.” And that it needs to be talked about “not just for women's sake, but for men's, too.”
    


            According to Shamsi, “social media has amplified women's voices – especially those of young women – who are increasingly educated, politically aware, and unafraid to own their choices. That visibility, that confidence, is unsettling for some men who have grown up believing their authority, their control, is a given.”
    


            “It's an identity crisis,” says Shamsi. “A subset of men is reacting with anxiety and aggression to this shift in gender dynamic as though the solution is to shrink women's spaces, rather than question why so many boys are being raised to feel threatened by equality.”
    


            The DRF's report stated that since 2017 its helpline “has documented over 20,000 cases of technology-facilitated gender-based violence and online threats, numbers that have only grown.”
    


            Kanwal Ahmed, a Pakistani social entrepreneur and storyteller, runs Soul Sister Pakistan, a Facebook group created in 2013 with over 300,000 followers. For years, it's operated as a popular safe digital space for Pakistani women online, but Ahmed says the criticism of her page has been unrelenting.
    


            “We have been called a man-hating, trauma-bonding club where all women do is gossip,” said Ahmed, who works with volunteers to help women in need who post on the page.
    


            Sana is not alone when it comes to unwanted online attention that's moved to real life.  Ahmed recalled a case in 2019 of a young woman who had been stalked by a man after her friend leaked her number online.
    


            “The only difference between her and Sana is that she wasn't killed, the stalker turned up at her door,” said Ahmed. “You don't have to be an influencer to face this, it can happen to anyone.”
    


            Natalia Tariq, the resource mobilization lead at the Association for Progressive Communications (APC), a worldwide network of social activists who use the internet to make the world a better place, tells CNN that there is “a complete culture of impunity” around online gender-based violence in Pakistan. Regulations and policies in place in the country are “absolutely inadequate,” she said.
    


            There's a perception in Pakistan that “violence that takes place online is not ‘real' and is therefore less harmful,” Tariq said. But she added that what are sometimes seen as “merely virtual” online threats can often turn to physical violence.
    


            Much praise has been heaped on Pakistani authorities for their sensitive and swift handling of Sana's murder, but some commentators say that's missing the point.
    


            Usama Khilji, the director of Bolo Bhi, a digital rights advocacy group Bolo Bhi, says Pakistan should be talking about educating boys about online harassment.
    


            “Men in leadership positions need to be talking about these issues,” according to Khilji.
    


            Khilji said hate speech against women in Pakistan is still “not a priority, and he's called on the government to “show leadership in combatting online crimes against women.”
    


            Sana's murder comes less than two weeks after a landmark ruling by the country's Supreme Court upheld the death penalty for Zahir Jaffer, who murdered Noor Mukkadam, the daughter of a distinguished diplomat, in 2021.
    


            The brutal beheading horrified the country and renewed calls for better protection for victims of gender-based violence.
    


            Noor's father, Shaukat Mukadam, has been lauded for his relentless campaign for justice for his daughter. After the ruling, Noor's family issued a statement saying the verdict was a “powerful reminder that women's lives matter.”



            Sana's father, Hassan, told CNN of his immense love for his daughter, of her plans to become a doctor, and the simple things that gave her joy, like birthday parties.
    


            “Every moment with her was unforgettable,” he said.

The Israeli Foreign Ministry has reportedly denied the country supplied Ukraine with Patriot air defense systems, contradicting comments made by its ambassador to Kiev.

Israeli envoy Michael Brodsky told Ukrainian media in an interview on Sunday that US-produced Patriot systems formerly deployed in Israel were now being used by Kiev's military. He expressed disappointment that the development “hasn't been widely discussed.”

However, a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday refuted the claim, according to Israeli and Russian news outlets.

“Israel did not transfer Patriot systems to Ukraine,” the ministry was quoted as saying.

Brodsky called the Patriots in question older models, initially deployed in the 1990s. The Israel Defense Forces decommissioned such “obsolete” systems last year and replaced them with newer, domestically manufactured platforms. Reports suggest the IDF was dissatisfied with the Patriot's performance during the 2014 Gaza conflict.

The ambassador's remarks were consistent with a May report by the New York Times that indicated the US was refurbishing an Israeli Patriot battery for eventual transfer to Ukraine. That agreement, sources told the newspaper, was finalized last September as part of President Joe Biden administration's broader effort to arm Ukraine. The handover was expected this summer.

In a separate report published in January, Axios claimed that dozens of Patriot interceptors were being sent from Israel to Ukraine through Poland. Israeli officials told the outlet that the munitions were being returned to the US, not directly provided to Kiev, Ukraine has been urging for more supplies to tackle a growing shortage of the projectiles.

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky claimed in 2024 that Israel “made a mistake” by not sending weapons to Kiev as he had requested. West Jerusalem has been seen as taking a cautious approach on the issue in order to preserve its relationship with Moscow.

In 2023, Israeli media reported that the government could supply Ukraine with electronic warfare systems designed to counter drone threats. In January, Ukrainian officials asked Israel to donate small arms captured from Hezbollah, which Israel claimed had originated in Russia.

Moscow has accused Ukraine's weapons donors of fueling an international arms black market. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has warned that weapons siphoned from Ukraine represent a global security threat – including to Israel.

MOSCOW, June 10. /TASS/. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and Milorad Dodik, leader of Republika Srpska, a constituent entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina, have been listed on the Ukrainian extremist website Myrotvorets (Peacemaker), according to TASS sources.

The site's operators claim Lula da Silva ""denies Ukraine's right to resist Russian aggression,"" that Dodik has ""attempted to undermine Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" and that Fico ""promotes Kremlin propaganda narratives.""

Notably, Fico, Lula da Silva, and Dodik recently visited Moscow to take part in celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War.

Founded in 2014, Myrotvorets seeks to identify and publish personal data of individuals it considers a threat to Ukraine's national security. The site's access has been blocked in Russia by court rulings.

Health officials, scientists and vaccine researchers sound alarm after health secretary fires 17 advisory members

Robert F Kennedy's “clean sweep” of a critical vaccine advisory panel spread shock and dismay among health experts, as many warned the health secretary's decision would erode trust in the US vaccine approval system.

The secretary fired all 17 members of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) advisory committee for immunization practices (ACIP) – a group of scientific experts who recommend how vaccines should be administered and distributed.

“Some would try to explain this away by blaming misinformation or antiscience attitudes,” Kennedy wrote in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, announcing the change, on Monday.

“To do so, however, ignores a history of conflicts of interest, persecution of dissidents, a lack of curiosity, and skewed science that has plagued the vaccine regulatory apparatus for decades.”

The immediate concern for public health officials, scientists and vaccine researchers was both the erosion in trust and who will fill the newly opened seats. Candidates for the voluntary roles often go through months of vetting, but it appears the new candidates may have already been chosen. A press release from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which Kennedy leads, said ACIP's upcoming June meeting would go forward as planned.

Dr Tom Frieden, president and CEO of the public health non-profit Resolve to Save Lives and a former CDC director, said in a statement on X that Kennedy's decision to remove the “seventeen dedicated doctors, pediatricians, scientists, and parents who served on [ACIP]” is “a dangerous and unprecedented action that makes our families less safe”.

“ACIP has long been a model for the world of transparent, fact-based guidance with rigorous reviews of vaccine safety and effectiveness,” Frieden said. “Make no mistake: politicizing the ACIP as Secretary Kennedy is doing will undermine public trust under the guise of improving it.”

Frieden's comments were echoed by scientists, doctors and public health leaders, many of whom questioned Kennedy's own conflicts of interest. Before becoming secretary, Kennedy led arguably the world's most influential anti-vaccine advocacy group and was paid by personal injury law firms for referring alleged victims of vaccine injuries.

“Removing all the members of the ACIP and replacing them with new members is far more likely to destroy public confidence in the federal government's approach to vaccines than to restore trust,” said Dr Robert Steinbrook, the health research group director of the nonprofit group Public Citizen, in a statement.

“It shouldn't matter which administration appointed the members of a federal scientific advisory committee. The wholesale firing and replacement of ACIP members is a blatantly political act that will undermine scientific impartiality and integrity, not promote it.”
 The CDC usually, though not always, takes ACIP's recommendations. A complementary panel advises the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on whether to approve vaccines, called the vaccine and related biologic products advisory committee (VRBPAC).

Those recommendations, which are approved by the head of the CDC, translate into official recommendations in the childhood and adult vaccine schedules. Those schedules are then used by insurers to decide which vaccines their plans should cover – making them a critically important document for Americans' access to immunizations.

Still, the CDC is without a leader, and Kennedy has not signed off on the most recent recommendations from ACIP, according to reporting from STAT.

The decision to fire the entire ACIP committee comes after Kennedy attempted to make an end-run around them for a separate announcement: that Covid-19 vaccines would no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women.

Ultimately, the recommendation for healthy children to receive the vaccine was preserved by the CDC, which added a new note that decisions about the Covid-19 vaccine should be made in “shared decision making” with a healthcare professional.

But Kennedy's initial announcement, which hit social media with few details, similarly shocked doctors. It also came only days after the leaders of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and FDA declared pregnancy one of many “underlying medical conditions that can increase a person's risk of severe Covid-19”. Kennedy oversees both agencies in his role as health secretary.

Doctors worried Kennedy's decision would bring “devastating consequences” for pregnant women, who are known to be more susceptible to severe complications from Covid-19 infection.

Kennedy attempted to justify his decision to recommend against vaccination during pregnancy to lawmakers on Capitol Hill in the days before he fired the ACIP committee members. In a document, HHS argued the vaccine was unsafe, but then cited studies whose results affirmed the vaccine's safety, according to Politico.

Leading vaccine experts have planned for Kennedy to cause upheaval to vaccine policy: in April, the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (Cidrap) at the University of Minnesota launched the Vaccine Integrity Project.

Kennedy's move did please one group: his anti-vaccine supporters.

“This represents an extremely positive development,” said Nicolas Hulscher, administrator for the McCullough Foundation, a nonprofit affiliated with Peter McCullough, a well known anti-vaccine campaigner. “We hope ACIP will be repopulated with truly independent experts who prioritize public safety over Vaccine Ideology.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Mike Huckabee suggested any future Palestinian state should be carved out of ‘a Muslim country'

Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, has said that the US is no longer pursuing the goal of an independent Palestinian state, marking what analysts describe as the most explicit abandonment yet of a cornerstone of US Middle East diplomacy.

Asked during an interview with Bloomberg News if a Palestinian state remains a goal of US policy, he replied: “I don't think so.”

The former Arkansas governor chosen by Donald Trump as his envoy to Israel went further by suggesting that any future Palestinian entity could be carved out of “a Muslim country” rather than requiring Israel to cede territory.

“Unless there are some significant things that happen that change the culture, there's no room for it,” Huckabee was quoted as saying. Those probably won't happen “in our lifetime”, he told the news agency.

When pressed on Palestinian aspirations in the West Bank, where 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli occupation, Huckabee employed Israeli government terminology, asking: “Does it have to be in Judea and Samaria?”

Trump, in his first term, was relatively tepid in his approach to a two-state solution, a longtime pillar of US Middle East policy, and he has given little sign of where he stands on the issue in his second term.

The state department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Middle East analysts said the comments made explicit a shift that has been broadly expected.

“This is not at all surprising given what we've seen in the last four-plus months, including the administration's open support for expelling the population of Gaza, the legitimization of Israeli settlement and annexation policies,” said Khaled Elgindy, a scholar at Georgetown University's Center for Contemporary Arab Studies and former adviser to Palestinian negotiators.

“This is an administration that is committed to Palestinian erasure, both physical and political,” Elgindy said. “The signs were there even in the first Trump term, which nominally supported a Palestinian ‘state' that was shorn of all sovereignty and under permanent Israeli control. At least now they've abandoned the pretense.”

Yousef Munayyer, head of Palestine/Israel Program at the Arab Center Washington DC, said Huckabee was merely articulating what US policy has long demonstrated in practice. “Mike Huckabee is saying out loud what US actions have been saying for decades and across different administrations,” he said. “Whatever commitments have been made in statements about a Palestinian state over time, US policy has never matched those stated commitments and only undercut them.”

The ambassador's position has deep roots in his evangelical Christian beliefs and longstanding support for Israeli settlement expansion. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Huckabee said: “There is no such thing as a Palestinian.” In a 2017 visit to the occupied West Bank, he rejected the concept of Israeli occupation entirely.

“I think Israel has title deed to Judea and Samaria,” said Huckabee at the time. “There are certain words I refuse to use. There is no such thing as a West Bank. It's Judea and Samaria. There's no such thing as a settlement. They're communities, they're neighborhoods, they're cities. There's no such thing as an occupation.”

What distinguishes Huckabee, Munayyer argued, has been his willingness to be explicit about objectives that previous officials had kept veiled. “What makes Huckabee unique is that he is shameless enough to admit out loud the goal of erasing the Palestinian people.”

The analysts add that Huckabee's explicit rejection of Palestinian statehood, which comes as the war in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and displaced most of the territory's more than 2 million residents, would also create diplomatic complications for US allies.

“This will put European and Arab states in a bind, since they are still strongly committed to two states but have always deferred to Washington,” Elgindy said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The cost of replacing Canada's aging warplanes with U.S.-made F-35 stealth strike fighters is expected to be nearly 50 per cent more than the estimate Ottawa provided Canadians, a report from the federal Auditor-General says.

These findings arrive as Prime Minister Mark Carney's government is weighing whether to scale back Ottawa's order for the F-35s and instead buy European-made fighter planes to reduce Canada's reliance on U.S. military equipment.

The federal government, which finalized a deal to buy 88 F-35 Lightning fighters from Lockheed Martin in December, 2022, said the acquisition would cost about $19-billion. But Auditor-General Karen Hogan's office said Tuesday it found this figure was based on outdated information and that by 2024, estimated costs had increased to $27.7-billion.

The warplane replacement program also faces significant risks that could jeopardize the introduction of a new fleet of fighters, the Auditor-General found. Construction of two new fighter squadron facilities in Cold Lake, Alta., and Bagotville, Que., to accommodate the F-35s is more than three years behind schedule and the Forces are facing a possible shortage of qualified pilots, the watchdog said Tuesday.

Trimming F-35 order could antagonize Trump as security and trade talks get under way: analysts

Inflation, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and heightened demand for munitions are three factors have driven up the cost of acquiring the F-35s, the Auditor-General found. The Department of National Defence “was supposed to closely monitor inflation and foreign currency exchange rates because of the potential impact but did not always do so,” it said.

The Office of the Auditor-General said even the updated $27-billion-plus price tag for the F-35s does not include essential Forces infrastructure upgrades and advanced weapons that would add at least another $5.5-billion to the total cost of acquiring the fighters.

Opinion: The solution to Canada's F-35 fighter jet dilemma? Buy both American and European aircraft

Canada's current fighter aircraft fleet of CF-18s is reaching the end of its service life and must be replaced in a timely manner to meet operational commitments such as the defence of Canada and North America, the Auditor-General's office noted. CF-18s are the primary Canadian aircraft assigned to the bilateral North American Aerospace Defense Command and are supposed to be on continuous alert to respond to potential aerial threats to the safety of North America, it said.

The CF-188 Hornet first entered service in the 1980s. The operating life of the Hornets has been extended through a refurbishment initiative known as the Hornet Extension Program, or HEP. 

CF-18s are supposed to be gradually withdrawn from service between 2025 and 2032 and replaced with F-35s.

David McGuinty, the Minister of National Defence, said in a statement he takes the auditor general's findings seriously. He committed to updating Canadians regularly on acquisition projects and blamed the huge cost increases on “external economic conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, including global supply chain disruptions, workforce shortages, and increased inflation and foreign exchange rates.”

Speaking to reporters later Tuesday, Mr. McGuinty defended the F-35 acquisition and declined to offer any indication that the government might reduce its U.S. warplane order. Shortly after Mr. Carney took office in March, the Prime Minister said Ottawa would weigh trimming its F-35 purchase plans to buy an alternative aircraft that would be more cost-effective, and could deliver additional industrial benefits domestically instead of sending more dollars to the U.S.

Mr. McGuinty spoke favourably of the F-35s. “I've just come back from the NATO meeting where I believe 30 of the 32 NATO partners are participating in the F-35 program,” he said, adding later: “It is a fifth-generation fighter jet at a time when the world is looking for fifth-generation fighter jet capacity right across NATO.”

He said the review of the F-35 order will be finished this summer and added he wouldn't prejudge its findings.

Speaking at a news conference Tuesday, Ms. Hogan said that while some of reasons for higher costs, such as inflation and currency fluctuations, are out of the government's control, Ottawa is responsible for higher costs related to delays in building the infrastructure required for the new aircraft.

“I think that's my biggest concern here,” she said. “This is a really long project, and in order to be ready to receive those planes, something needs to happen to fill the gap for trained pilots and to have the infrastructure ready. Because right now, the interim measures are only going to see additional costs.”

Andrea Charron, director of the Centre for Defence and Security Studies at the University of Manitoba, said there has not always been sufficient attention to big-ticket procurements both within the Department of National Defence and elsewhere, such as Treasury Board and Public Works.

“Canada has lost many procurement specialists, and they tend to rotate positions, especially who is the lead on the F-35, and so there is not necessarily consistent, persistent attention to a very complicated file,” Prof. Charron said.

“Multiple eyes are supposed to be on these contracts, so where is the accountability of the other departments as well?”

At least 11 people have died after a school shooting in southern Austria. Police said the gunman was a 21-year-old former student at the school who killed himself after the attack.

Multiple people have been killed in a gun attack at a high school in the southern Austrian city of Graz.

Police said 10 people were killed during the incident — including the suspected shooter — while several more people were seriously injured.

Another victim later succumbed to their injuries in hospital.

""The rampage at a school in Graz is a national tragedy that has deeply shaken our entire country,"" Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker said.

""There are no words for the pain and grief that we all — all of Austria — are feeling right now.""

A police operation began at 10 a.m. local time (0800 UTC), with authorities later saying the school had been successfully evacuated.

""The situation is secure,"" police said. ""No further danger is expected.""

Police said that a helicopter had been deployed as part of the operation.

Graz has around 300,000 inhabitants and is the capital of Styria state.

Austrian authorities described the shooter as a 21-year-old man who was not known to police.

He carried out the school shooting with a long gun and a handgun that he owned legally.

Police said the suspected perpetrator's motive was initially unclear.

They said the gunman killed himself in a toilet in the school after carrying out the shooting.

Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said that the shooter was a former student at the high school who did not graduate.

He said on Tuesday afternoon that 10 people were killed in the attack, including the suspected perpetrator. Among them, six of the victims were female and three were male.

The minister added that 12 people were wounded in the shooting, with some of them sustaining serious injuries. One of the wounded individuals later died in hospital, local medical authorities said.

Austrian public broadcaster ORF reported that both students and teachers were among the casualties.

Police said they believed that the shooter had acted alone.

Austria's chancellor declared three days of national mourning following the shooting, which he described as a ""dark day in the history of our country.""

Flags are to be flown at half-mast, with national minute of mourning scheduled for 10 a.m. on Wednesday.

President Alexander van der Bellen said that the attack had hit Austria ""right in the heart.""

""Austria is in mourning,"" he said. ""And in this hour, we are standing together.""

The chancellor of neighboring Germany, Friedrich Merz, said Germans were mourning with Austrians.

""Horrific news from Graz. Our thoughts are with our Austrian friends and we mourn with them,"" he said.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also expressed her condolences in an X post.

""My thoughts are with the victims, their families and friends,"" she said. ""Schools are a symbol for youth, hope and the future. It is hard to bear when schools become places of death and violence.""

EU top diplomat Kaja Kallas said she was ""deeply shocked by the news of the school shooting in Austria.""

""Every child should feel safe at school and be able to learn free from fear and violence.""

Austria has nearly 30 civilian firearms per 100 people, according to the Small Arms Survey research project.

The Alpine country has banned automatic weapons and pump action guns, while revolvers, pistols and semi-automatic weapons are allowed with a permit.

Rifles and shotguns are permitted with a firearms license, a valid hunting licence or for members of shooting clubs.

In 2020, four were killed and 22 injured in a shooting in the center of Vienna. That attack was carried out by a sympathizer of the so-called Islamic State (IS) group.

Tuesday's school shooting appeared to be the deadliest attack in Austria's post-World War II history.

President Donald Trump's order banning citizens of 12 countries, now in effect, aims to protect the US from ""foreign terrorists."" What are the reasons and who is exempt?

This time, it's not a new executive order but a presidential proclamation that has caused a worldwide stir. The policy signed by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday is entitled ""Restricting the Entry of Foreign Nationals to Protect the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats"" and takes effect on June 9.

Like executive orders, presidential proclamations are one of the instruments with which a US president can implement the administration's will, particularly regarding national security and immigration.

Unlike laws, these documents do not require the approval of Congress. However, they must be based on powers granted by law. In terms of content, Trump's new proclamation ties in with previous travel bans imposed during his first term as president, which the Supreme Court upheld in 2018.

The proclamation bans entry to the US for all nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, regardless of their reasons for travel, unless the State Department deems their entry into the US to be in the national interest.

In addition to these 12 countries, people from seven additional nations will face partial restrictions: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Stricter visa checks and restrictions will apply, but these will also be case-dependent. A wealthy businessperson might be allowed to enter, while tourists or students could face higher hurdles.

In a video published on social media, Trump cited the June 1 attack in Boulder, Colorado as his reason for the order, saying it ""underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted."" He also said nationals from certain countries posed ""significant risks"" of overstaying their visas.

An Egyptian man has been charged with injuring several people when he hurled Molotov cocktails at a demonstration in Boulder calling for the release of Hamas-held hostages in Gaza. According to the US Department of Homeland Security, he had overstayed his tourist visa. Egypt is not listed in Trump's newest proclamation.

In the proclamation, the Republican president argues that the countries affected by the new travel ban do not provide enough information on their nationals to assess potential security risks. Some of the countries listed — Iran and Cuba, for example — have been designated by Washington as ""state sponsors of terrorism."" This new ban will tighten up already existing measures.

The Trump administration has criticized the fact that some countries do not take back their nationals when the US requires them to leave.

However, critics have speculated that the ban has political and economic reasons, pointing out that Saudi Arabia and other countries, with which the Trump family has close business ties, will not be affected.

If not exempt, nationals from the banned countries will no longer be able to enter the US from June 9 for business trips, educational travel or family visits. The decision is also likely to have economic repercussions. The poorer countries on the list in particular, such as Haiti and Yemen, have benefited from trade ties with the US, as well as remittances sent by people living and working in the US.

Human rights groups have slammed the travel ban as being racist and discriminatory, pointing out that refugees and asylum-seekers from conflict regions will now lose access to protection programs in the US.

Trump also announced specific measures to block new foreign students from attending Harvard University, whom he accused of developing ""extensive entanglements with foreign countries, including our adversaries"" and flouting ""the civil rights of its students and faculty.""

""I have determined that it is necessary to restrict the entry of foreign nationals who seek to enter the United States solely or principally to participate in a course of study at Harvard University or in an exchange visitor program hosted by Harvard University,"" Trump stated in his proclamation.

Initially, entry to almost all foreign nationals seeking to study or participate in educational programs at Harvard will be suspended for six months. The suspension period could be extended. The US State Department will be directed to examine whether to revoke the existing visas of students at the university.

In a statement, Harvard said this was ""yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the administration in violation of Harvard's First Amendment rights."" Earlier this year, Harvard President Alan Garber wrote that the university, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, would not ""surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.""

Patients serve as the unwitting guinea pigs — with very real consequences.

This article was originally published by The Lever, an investigative newsroom. If you like this story, sign up for The Lever's free newsletter.

Nieraj Jain was puzzled by the patient sitting quietly in front of him. The woman, in her 60s, was losing her eyesight; that much was clear. Her vision was blurred, and she was having increasing difficulty seeing at night and in bright sunlight. Less obvious was the cause. A retinal specialist and surgeon at Emory University in Georgia, Jain pored over specialized scans of her eye and saw odd patches of pigment on her retina — patches that didn't fit with any known diagnosis.

A fleeting memory pulled him up short; hadn't he seen another patient a few months before with a similar finding? Combing through patient records, Jain dug up five more patients at Emory with the same puzzling retinal changes. All were going blind — and all happened to be taking Elmiron, a drug for a bladder condition called interstitial cystitis. In 2018, Jain and his colleagues published their findings about this new cause of blindness, dubbing it “pigmentary maculopathy.” 

Meanwhile, gastroenterologists at Emory and other institutions were uncovering another troubling finding about Elmiron: Some patients on the drug were being diagnosed with colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with potentially life-threatening complications. 

According to a government database analyzed by The Lever and the McGraw Center for Business Journalism at CUNY's Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, by the end of 2024, hundreds of patients on Elmiron had suffered vision loss or blindness. Others taking the drug were even more unlucky. Dozens of patient deaths associated with Elmiron were reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and 45 patients were hospitalized with severe colitis.

Another problem? There's no good evidence that Elmiron works. 

When the government approved Elmiron in 1996, the manufacturer provided close to zero data that the drug effectively treated interstitial cystitis. Regulators allowed Elmiron on the market only on the proviso that the company conduct a second study to determine if it worked. It would take 18 years for the various companies that bought and sold the drug's license to produce that study — and it proved to be a resounding bust. Patients who took Elmiron did no better than those given a sugar pill. (Janssen, which manufactures Elmiron, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.)

All of which raises a question: How could a drug with such serious side effects get on the market in the first place? And how could it stay on the market for nearly three decades, even after subsequent studies failed to show it was effective? The answer to both questions strikes at the heart of what ails the FDA today.

Elmiron is just one of hundreds of drugs that have been approved by the FDA over the last several decades on the basis of flimsy or nonexistent evidence. Drug companies have been allowed to market hundreds of prescription drugs to doctors and sell them to unsuspecting patients despite glaringly inadequate evidence that they offer any benefit and in many cases amid clear signs that they pose a risk of serious, often irreparable harm. 

From January 2013 until Dec. 31, 2022, the FDA approved 429 drugs, most of which were authorized on the basis of inadequate evidence that they worked, according to a database of government records created for this investigation. Based on an analysis of these records, the agency has allowed dozens of treatments, like Elmiron, to remain on the market even when subsequent studies failed to show they are effective. This investigation found that from 2013 through 2022:

Many of the issues with drug approvals uncovered in this investigation are particularly concerning with regard to cancer treatments. 

These statistics come after billions of dollars and years of lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry and patient advocacy groups pressuring Congress to loosen the FDA's scientific standards.

The resulting seismic shift from proving drugs work before they are approved to showing they work only after approval — if ever — has been quietly accomplished with virtually no awareness by doctors or the public. Insurers and taxpayers effectively pay for research after drugs hit the market as pharmaceutical companies reap the profits. Patients serve as the unwitting guinea pigs — with very real consequences. 

In the U.S. alone, an estimated 128,000 people are killed each year by side effects of prescription drugs that are properly prescribed. That number excludes opioid overdoses and is more than deaths from all illegal drugs combined. And the rate at which the agency approves unproven drugs has accelerated dramatically in the last 10 years. 

These are just some of the findings of a two-year investigation by The Lever and the McGraw Center into all 429 new drugs approved from 2013 through 2022. A team of four experts, three of whom are physicians and one a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard, evaluated the scientific studies cited by the agency in its approval decisions. 

In addition, the authors used government reports, internal FDA documents, investigators' notes, congressional testimony, court records, and interviews with more than 100 researchers, legal scholars, current and former federal officials, patients, and their families.

A 14-member advisory committee including physicians, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, a patient advocate, an FDA insider, and an FDA advisor provided guidance for the investigation. Several of the advisers vetted the findings for accuracy.

These experts were shocked by some of this investigation's findings.

“I've been discouraged about the FDA before, but the last few years have been the worst,” said one of those advisers, Diana Zuckerman, founder and president of the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit National Center for Health Research. “The scientific bar is often so low it would be impossible to lower it much further.” 

Examining the nation's drug approval process has gained urgency in the wake of President Donald Trump's executive orders demanding federal agencies deregulate numerous industries. And while Martin Makary, Trump's pick for FDA commissioner, has written widely about medical error and the need for more rigorous medical science, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is known for his unsupported claims about medicines and vaccines. 

Experts say the current political reality doesn't bode well for a drug-approval process that's already plagued by deficiencies.

“We need an agency that's independent from the industry it regulates and that uses high quality science to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs,” says Reshma Ramachandran, a co-director of the Yale Collaboration for Regulatory Rigor, Integrity, and Transparency and an expert in analyzing clinical trials, “Without that, we might as well go back to the days of snake oil and patent medicines.” 

Between drugs, food, dietary supplements, tobacco, and medical devices, the FDA regulates $3.9 trillion worth of products each year, roughly one-eighth of the entire U.S. economy. With a budget of approximately $6.9 billion in 2024, hundreds of offices in the U.S. and abroad, and more than 19,000 full-time employees (prior to recent firings), the FDA's resources and scope make it one of the most powerful agencies in the country and highly influential around the world. 

Its reputation was built on hard-won scientific standards put into place by Congress in 1938 and 1962 after a string of medical tragedies. These new laws, sometimes called “super-statutes” because they are so far-reaching, authorized the agency to require drug companies to provide evidence that their drugs are safe and effective before they could go on the market. 

Then came AIDS. By 1988, the epidemic was in full swing: 46,000 people had died, and another 37,000 were living in the U.S. with the poorly understood condition. AIDS activist groups wanted access to new drugs — and fast. With news cameras rolling, activists blockaded the entrance to FDA headquarters in Rockville, Maryland, holding placards saying “Federal Death Administration,” and lying on the street holding cardboard tombstones that read “Killed by the FDA.” 

Activists found ready partners in drugmakers, who were eager to get their products to market. Together, the activists and companies argued before the FDA that the compassionate, lifesaving strategy would be to loosen scientific standards for establishing the efficacy of drugs. 

Among those existing standards was the strong recommendation that companies submit two or more randomized, controlled clinical trials that show a drug is effective in order to win approval. That's because any single study, no matter how well it's conducted, will often yield results that can happen by chance alone and do not stand up to later scrutiny. 

But these trials can be expensive and time-consuming to conduct and analyze. Between that and a shortage of FDA reviewers, new treatments for AIDS were flowing through the chronically underfunded agency at the speed of chilled molasses. It took an average of seven to twelve years to take a drug through the development pipeline, three of which could be taken up while a company's data sat on an FDA reviewer's desk. 

Under pressure from patient groups and drugmakers, the FDA created an “accelerated pathway” in 1992, which allowed companies to provide preliminary evidence that their AIDS drugs were effective. The new rules let these companies conduct trials tracking unreliable patient outcomes known as “surrogates,” with the expectation that drugmakers would provide more substantive evidence of real patient benefit after the drugs were on the market. 

Surrogate outcomes are laboratory tests, or imaging studies like CT scans, that don't themselves track quality or quantity of life, but are hypothesized to be reasonably likely to predict a so-called “clinical benefit.” Clinical outcomes are the ones that matter to patients, like feeling better and living longer, but relying on surrogate outcomes means that drug companies could gain approval based on shorter and cheaper studies. 

The problem is that improvements in a surrogate outcome often fail to correlate with whether a drug actually improves patients' lives. In addition, a surrogate outcome can't reflect the harm that a drug can cause, a limitation that has been repeatedly confirmed. 

Some external experts therefore expressed concern about approving drugs based on surrogate outcomes — and those worries were borne out by the AIDS drug AZT. 

When AZT was approved in 1987, many expected it to be a raging success based on research that counted T-cells, disease-fighting cells that the AIDS virus attacks, and other studies that tracked early survival data. But less than two years later, researchers at the Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris published their findings on 365 AIDS patients treated with AZT, concluding the results were “disappointing.” The drug was toxic to blood cells, and after six months, patients “returned to their pretreatment levels [of T-cells] and several opportunistic infections, malignancies, and deaths occurred.'' (AZT would prove beneficial in later years when used in lower doses as part of a triple cocktail of AIDS drugs.)

Still, the pharmaceutical industry actively promoted the treatment. With a list price of $21,000 a year per patient in 2025 dollars, AZT delivered $2 billion in profits to its drugmaker Burroughs Wellcome in 1989. Seeing the rewards to be reaped, companies began lobbying Congress to force the FDA to apply the looser AIDS standards to all sorts of drugs. 

Big Pharma's campaign contributions jumped from $1.9 million in 1990 to $3.6 million in 1992, according to the Federal Election Committee and OpenSecrets, an independent research group. That year, Congress passed the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which explicitly directed the FDA to allow approvals based on lower standards. 

Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) slammed the legislation, saying that while it “sounds good… it is a hoax to imply that it will do more than the FDA is already doing to bring effective AIDS drugs to the market.”

The act also required drug companies to pay “user fees,” which the agency used to hire nearly 600 new staff. But critics say such fees have led some senior agency officials to view the industry as “partners.” The agency would go on to launch multiple “public-private partnerships” with the companies it is tasked with regulating.

Subsequent laws directed the FDA to expedite drug approvals by further lowering standards of evidence. 

“We opened Pandora's Box, and Pharma exploited it,” says Gregg Gonsalves, an AIDS activist and professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health. In 1993, he told an FDA advisory committee that with the best of intentions, and in the face of a terrifying health crisis, AIDS activists had helped “unleash drugs with well-documented toxicities onto the market, without obtaining rigorous data on their clinical efficacy.” 

The result, said Gonsalves, is “we've arrived in hell.”

Today, hundreds of drugs intended to treat a wide range of diseases have been approved by the FDA without critical evidence demonstrating they work. 

According to the database created for this investigation, nearly three-quarters — 311 — of the 429 drugs approved from 2013 through 2022 were put on the market despite inadequate evidence of their efficacy. 

This analysis was based on the four essential criteria cited in the FDA's own standards and case law for assessing whether drugs work and are safe: 

These criteria are by no means a complete list of sound scientific evidence. Instead, they comprise the minimum criteria needed to determine whether drugmakers have provided “substantial evidence” to support claims of effectiveness for new drugs. 

Yet only 118 of the 429 drugs approved over that period, a mere 28 percent, met the four criteria. One hundred and twenty-three drugs (29 percent) met three of the criteria, while 39 drugs, more than 9 percent of the total, failed to meet a single criterion. That doesn't mean these drugs don't work, but it does mean the FDA approved them without knowing whether they are more likely to help patients than hurt them. 

More than a quarter of the drugs approved over the study period, 123, were for various forms of cancer. This might seem like good news for the war on cancer, but only three of those drugs met all four of the minimum criteria, and 29 cancer drugs failed to meet a single criterion. In other words, one in four cancer drugs were approved based on studies with no comparison group, no blinding, no replication, and no clinical outcome. 

The most common way drug companies get such cancer drugs approved is by using a surrogate outcome in their clinical trials, rather than measuring actual clinical benefit. Drug companies routinely study laboratory measures like how much a tumor shrinks in response to a drug, instead of mortality or symptom relief. 

But experts say the FDA should have no illusions regarding the unreliability of such surrogate outcomes, especially since these outcomes fail to take into account the harms a drug may cause, such as liver failure and anemia. These criticisms were hammered home after the agency approved Avastin to treat metastatic breast cancer. 

Originally approved for two other types of cancers, Avastin hit the market for breast cancer in 2008. At that time, women with metastatic breast cancer faced a dire prognosis: Most would be dead within five years, even after multiple rounds of chemotherapy drugs. Avastin was hailed as a breakthrough because it doesn't kill cancer cells the way chemotherapy does but instead inhibits the growth of blood vessels, which tumors need to grow. 

Avastin was approved based on a surrogate outcome called “progression-free survival,” which doesn't actually look at patient survival but instead measures how long a cancer drug keeps a tumor in check. But just because a tumor isn't growing or even shrinks doesn't mean the patient will live longer or enjoy a better quality of life. 

In 2010, worldwide Avastin sales had hit $6.8 billion. The approval for breast cancer had come with the condition that the manufacturer, Genentech, conduct another study to determine whether the drug actually worked. Two years later, the company produced two studies that suggested the opposite: the drug did not help people live longer.

In total, the company had conducted five clinical trials, none of which demonstrated that Avastin helped breast cancer patients live longer or with less disability. The new studies also documented the drug's more serious side effects, which included blood clots, perforated intestines, stroke, heart problems, and kidney malfunction. Genentech did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

But when the FDA proposed withdrawing approval for Avastin for breast cancer, Genentech and several patient advocacy groups fought back, sometimes viciously. At a two-day public hearing in 2011, one of the few patient advocates testifying in favor of the FDA's decision came with a bodyguard after being threatened verbally by others who supported Avastin. FDA staff received violent threats, and police were posted outside the building.

The FDA ultimately withdrew its approval of Avastin for breast cancer, but the episode, still referred to as “Armageddon” by some staff, had a chilling effect. The agency would not demand another drug withdrawal in the face of company opposition for more than two decades. 

Today, progression-free survival, along with a half-dozen other surrogate outcomes, has become the norm for approving cancer drugs. This investigation found that 81 percent of the 123 cancer drugs approved from 2013 through 2022 were based on studies that did not track overall survival and instead reported on progression-free survival or another surrogate. 

Such approvals have real consequences for patients. Take Copiktra, a cancer drug manufactured by Secura Bio Inc. that was approved by the FDA in 2018 based on improved progression-free survival and other surrogate outcomes. According to a Lever review of FDA records, two-thirds of leukemia and lymphoma patients taking the drug developed serious complications. Patients treated with Copiktra also died 11 months earlier than patients treated with the comparator drug. 

In December 2021, the manufacturer announced it would stop marketing the drug for follicular lymphoma. Six months later, the FDA issued a warning about “possible increased risk of death and serious side effects.” But it wasn't until July 2024 — six years after studies showed the drug cut months off the lives of patients — that the FDA announced that Copitra should not be used as first- or second-line treatment for certain types of leukemia and lymphoma “due to an increased risk of treatment-related mortality.” 

A spokesperson for Copiktra's manufacturer, Secura Bio, told The Lever that in May 2022, the company sent a “Dear Healthcare Professional” letter to physicians about the results of the post-market studies “in accordance with FDA requirements.” The company said Copiktra can still be prescribed for certain conditions if two other drug treatments have failed.

Copiktra is hardly an exception. According to a 2015 study, only 14 percent of cancer drugs approved based on a surrogate outcome, such as progression-free survival, between 2008 and 2012 were later shown to improve real-world survival. In other words, 86 percent were not supported by evidence that they helped patients live longer. What the drugs did cause were numerous serious side effects, while costing patients, taxpayers, and insurers billions of dollars a year. 

Another, more recent study found that between January 2006 and December 2023, 147 cancer drugs that had been approved on a surrogate outcome were later tested to determine if they improved overall survival. Approximately three-quarters failed to do so. 

Even when cancer drugs do improve survival, the gains can be meager. A 2022 study by researchers at the National Cancer Institute found that the median survival time for 124 cancer medicines approved from 2003 through 2021 to treat solid tumors was just 2.8 months. The average cost of such drugs is more than $24,000 per month. 

In other words, after patients and their families spend financially crippling sums and go through side effects ranging from nausea to death, their outcomes are hardly better — and could be worse — than no treatment at all. 

That outcome is not what most cancer patients expect when their doctor writes a prescription. It's also at odds with what doctors believe about the meaning of FDA drug approvals. In 2016, researchers published the results of a survey sent to physicians that included the following question: “For [the] FDA to approve a drug, must the studies show: a.) a clinically important result; b.) a statistically significant result; c.) both; d.) None of the above.” The correct answer was none of the above. 

Only 6 percent of doctors got the answer right. Aaron Kesselheim, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and co-author of the report, said the result was “disappointing, but not entirely surprising. Doctors aren't taught about the approval process.” 

Nothing about ProAmatine would suggest it would ever get on the market.

This investigation found that between 1990 and 1996, the FDA rejected the blood pressure drug four times. The agency told the company, Roberts Pharmaceutical, that its studies showing ProAmatine could treat low blood pressure when a patient stands up were “poorly conducted.” Nor were the “incremental” increases in blood pressure sufficient proof of benefit since they were surrogate measures, according to the agency, which wanted evidence that patients would feel or function better. The agency instructed the company to conduct randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. 

Before the agency rejected the drug for the fourth time, in March 1996, FDA medical reviewer Maryann Gordon noted a striking incidence of severe high blood pressure among treated patients. She suggested that this side effect might account for at least some of the strokes, heart attacks, and congestive heart failure that had occurred among patients on ProAmatine. She concluded, “…the mostly unexplored benefits of midodrine do not outweigh its real risks, thus making midodrine [ProAmatine] not approvable.” 

But less than three months after the FDA's fourth rejection of ProAmatine, the agency reversed course, saying that following a meeting with the company, it had “reconsidered” its prior rejection and would approve ProAmatine after all, under “21 Code of Federal Regulations Subpart H,” a provision in the regulations that the FDA interprets as giving the agency “flexibility” in its approval decisions. 

One FDA insider who asked to remain anonymous told The Lever, “Subpart H was never meant to rescue failed drug development programs after trials had already failed to show direct benefit to patients.” Instead, the provision was designed to allow the agency leeway in approving drugs that looked highly promising for life-threatening conditions for which there were few or no other treatments. 

While the condition treated by ProAmatine is not life-threatening, Roberts Pharmaceutical was able to use the regulation to get the drug on the market in 1996, agreeing to submit a follow-up study no later than 2000 to determine if the drug worked. 

The year 2000 came and went. No study. In 2003, the drug patent expired. Still no study. The FDA tried to induce the company to conduct the promised post-market study by granting a three-year patent exclusivity extension, allowing the company to maintain a monopoly on the drug and keep its prices high. In 2005, the company submitted two studies, but the FDA found them insufficient.

In 2013, researchers at the Mayo Clinic conducted a comprehensive review of all studies of the drug and found ProAmatine provided “no significant benefit” in blood pressure change on standing up. The drug also caused a higher incidence of adverse events, and the researchers concluded “there is insufficient and low-quality evidence” to support its use. 

Yet, the drug was allowed to remain on the market with no caution issued to patients or doctors until 2017. As of 2009, it had generated $257 million in sales; in 2023, the midodrine market was estimated to be $745 million. Twenty-nine years after the drug was approved, there is still no evidence that it works. The drug is no longer made by Roberts, and three generic manufacturers who make it did not respond to requests for comment. 

“I think rightly or wrongly, FDA managers have decided that completely bending their standards could still lead to good drugs,” says Matthew Herder, a legal scholar at the University of Dalhousie in Halifax, Canada. “They put a lot of faith in post-market evidence.” But the history of ProAmatine demonstrates that once a drug has been approved on an expedited basis, a requirement for post-market evidence can have little meaning. 

According to a 2022 analysis by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, more than one-third of drugs approved on an accelerated pathway have never seen a confirmatory trial. When they did conduct the studies, regulators found companies took anywhere from a few months to 12 years to do so. This investigation found that confirmatory trials can take even longer — up to 30 years — and may not be performed at all. 

ProAmatine, no longer sold under its brand name, is currently manufactured by multiple companies under the generic name midodrine. Three generic manufacturers of midodrine failed to respond to requests for comment.

Even when post-market studies are submitted, they often provide no new information. Bishal Gyawali, an oncologist and associate professor at Queen's University in Kingston, Canada, and two Harvard colleagues looked at cancer drugs approved based on surrogate outcomes between December 1992 and May 2017. Twenty percent of the time, the company submitted a follow-up study that looked at the same surrogate it used to get the drug approved — even though the point of the additional study was to determine whether the drug offered an actual clinical benefit. In another 21 percent, the follow-up trial used a different surrogate endpoint, rather than clinical outcomes.

Such scenarios are so common that the agency has created a term, “dangling approvals,” for the status of drugs whose post-market trials failed or weren't conducted before their deadline. As of 2021, the FDA had allowed 10 of 35 cancer treatments to remain on the market even after their follow-up studies failed. The manufacturers eventually withdrew eight of the 10 treatments, but only after patients received ineffective treatments for years and companies reaped healthy financial rewards. 

Among the drugs with dangling approvals was one that had generated controversy before: Avastin, the failed breast cancer drug. Avastin has been shown to improve survival for some cancers, and in 2009, the FDA authorized the drug for recurrent glioblastoma, a fatal brain cancer, based on progression-free survival. In 2017, after the requisite “confirmatory” trials, the agency granted it full approval — even though the follow-up studies failed to show it helped patients live any longer. 

Avastin remains on the market for recurrent glioblastoma — at a cost of $153,000 per year. European regulators refused to approve the drug for that use, citing concerns about safety and efficacy. A spokesperson for Genentech said some patients could benefit, noting that eleven percent of patients were able to discontinue treatment with steroids.

Then there's Keytruda, which is widely advertised on TV for a number of cancers. Granted expedited approval in 2017 to treat a certain type of gastric cancer, the drug subsequently failed its post-market study. Keytruda was sold for this use for nearly four years before regulators withdrew its approval in 2021. It remains on the market for other cancers. Merck did not respond to requests for comment.

While drug companies profit from the sales of unproven drugs, everyone else — patients, insurers, and the government — pays a heavy price. In just four years, from 2018 through 2021, the taxpayer-funded health insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid shelled out $18 billion for drugs approved on the condition that their manufacturers produce confirmatory trials that had yet to be delivered. 

“Everybody from the [FDA] commissioner on down keeps telling us that approving these marginal drugs will lead to an accumulation of benefits to patients over time, but if a drug doesn't work, it doesn't work, and putting them all together doesn't add up to an effective treatment,” says Fran Visco, a breast cancer survivor and president and cofounder of the National Breast Cancer Coalition. “The entire medical oncology treatment world is built on a shaky foundation of limited evidence and uncertain patient benefit, but rather than admit that, we keep tweaking it and building on top of it. And it's not just that you are giving people things that don't work, these drugs will harm them, and they are financially toxic.”

In defending dangling approvals, Richard Pazdur, a physician and the head of the cancer drug division at the FDA, wrote in 2021 that when a drug fails in a clinical trial, it “does not necessarily mean that the drug is ineffective.” In one sense, Pazdur is right. Not having convincing evidence that a drug works is not the same as knowing it does not work.

What the scenario does mean is no one knows if it works or not.This investigation's database shows that hundreds of drugs are now being put on the market before anybody knows if they're effective. 

In the past, having a promising surrogate endpoint was used by drug companies to decide whether proceeding to a clinical trial was worth the investment. Now, drugs are put on the market, sold to thousands if not millions of patients, and the evidence to determine if they actually work is allowed to come later, if it comes at all. 

The arrangement can have devastating costs for people like Laura MacMillan.

Starting in 2001, Laura MacMillan was diagnosed with a series of puzzling medical conditions. First came interstitial cystitis. Two years later, when she was only 45, she developed severe abdominal pain and diarrhea that was diagnosed as colitis. “I could barely leave my house,” she says. “I had frequent accidents and could only go to stores where I knew there was a bathroom.” 

Twelve years later, she began to see wavy lines as her vision progressively dimmed. One evening, she drove over a cement island in a parking lot, leaving her with a flat tire and $4,700 of damage to her car. Her ophthalmologist could find no known diagnosis for her eye condition and could offer no treatment. Between the colitis and progressing blindness, MacMillan's world was closing in.

Finally, in 2021, MacMillan came across Nieraj Jain's troubling findings of blindness linked to the interstitial cystitis drug Elmiron and instantly put two and two together. She had been on Elmiron for 20 years and had experienced the same retinal changes Jain uncovered. She stopped the drug and within weeks, her colitis symptoms went away. A subsequent colonoscopy showed her gut had completely healed, but MacMillan's vision loss is permanent.  

“I can't drive anymore,” she says. “I had to stop working 13 years ago. When I get up in the morning, it can take about two hours for the blurriness to subside enough for me to see words on my tablet. Last summer, my husband and I drove [1,000 miles] to Toronto to see the Blue Jays play the Yankees. Even though we had good seats, I couldn't see a damn thing. So we won't ever be able to do that again.” 

MacMillan is relatively lucky compared to the hundreds of others uncovered by this investigation who suffered serious injuries or died while taking the drug.

The FDA continues to approve medicines based on evidence as flimsy, contradictory, and inadequate as the data for Elmiron. Citing the need for “flexibility” and the importance of encouraging drug development when there are few treatment options, the agency has all but abandoned its hard-won standards for sound science, according to numerous experts. 

Jerome Hoffman, professor emeritus of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the lead analyst of the database created for this investigation, says, “Most of us imagine that the primary goal of the FDA is to make sure that the drugs it approves are more likely to help people than to harm them. If so, the FDA would require drugmakers to submit rigorous studies. Instead, the agency seems to have forgotten about that goal and is more interested in promoting the interests of industry than protecting the public health.” 

In 2014, the Elmiron Study Group published their results of the long-awaited clinical trial that showed Elmiron was no better than a placebo. “I thought that the next day it would be over for Elmiron,” says Curtis Nickel, a urologist at Kingston Hospital in Ontario, Canada, who led the study group. “Doctors would stop prescribing it. The FDA would order it off the market.” But none of that happened. 

Instead, after 24 years, Elmiron is still being sold, and doctors continue to prescribe it. Hundreds of thousands of patients have been exposed to the drug, and the American Urological Association lists it as the only FDA-approved medication for interstitial cystitis. The agency finally added a warning to the drug label in 2020, alerting doctors and patients to the risk of vision loss. 

Nowhere is there any mention that studies have never shown Elmiron is effective.

Forcing people to move or prohibiting their mobility are two sides of the same colonial or neocolonial coin.

In an aphorism sometimes attributed to Leo Tolstoy, sometimes to John Gardner, all literature relies on one of two plots: a person goes on a journey or a stranger comes to town.

Let me offer my own version. We might summarize the entire history of the human race in two words: people move. Everything else is just elaboration on that basic plot.

Some of history's worst atrocities can be attributed to certain people trying to control other people's movements, whether by capturing them, herding them into prison camps (concentration camps, strategic hamlets, model villages), enslaving and transporting them, or warehousing them in besieged countries or regions while barricading the borders of anyplace to which they might want to flee, often consigning them to death in treacherous deserts or seas for trying to exercise the basic human right of freedom of movement.

In February, President Trump astonished the world by proclaiming that the United States should “take over” Gaza and rid it entirely of its Palestinian population. Yet in many ways, as startling as that might have seemed, his proposal fit right in with his drive to remove millions of people from the United States. Both reflected a colonial arrogance that the U.S. and Israel share: the idea that some people (Americans/Europeans/Whites/colonizers) have the right to move themselves as they desire while moving others against their will. Consider it, after a fashion, a contemporary (as well as historic) version of apartheid.

Forcing people to move or prohibiting their mobility are two sides of the same colonial or neocolonial coin. Colonizers invade and drive people out or enslave, transport, enclose, and imprison them while barricading off the privileged spaces they create for themselves. In a vicious cycle, colonizers or imperial powers justify their borders and walls in the name of “security” while protecting themselves from those desperate to escape their domination. And such ideas, old as they may be, are still distinctly with us.

European imperial actors from Christopher Columbus on claimed the right to freedom of movement on this planet. Today, the flyer you get in the mail with your passport proudly insists that, “with your U.S. passport, the world is yours!”

Or consider historian and scientist Jared Diamond's nonchalant claim that “no traditional society tolerated the relatively open access enjoyed by modern American or European citizens, most of whom can travel anywhere… merely by presenting a valid passport and visa to a passport control officer.”

Diamond argued that Americans and Europeans exemplify the freedoms of modernity, while more “traditional societies” oppress people by restricting their travel. But if Americans and Europeans enjoy the freedom to travel, it's not because they are so much more modern than other inhabitants of this planet. It's because other countries don't restrict their freedom. On the other hand, it's the U.S. and Europe, Diamond's symbols of modernity, that tend to impose the greatest restrictions with their militarized borders and deportation regimes.

Perhaps we could better define modernity as the European drive to control mobility, forcing others to accept their intrusions while denying free mobility to the rest of the world. The United States and Israel offer a spectrum of examples of how the right to deport, the right to transport, the right to enclose, and the right to exclude tend to complement one another on this strange planet of ours. Both countries claim to be liberal democracies and celebrate their commitment to equal rights, while reserving those rights for some and excluding others.

While it's easy to imagine that colonialism is part of our past, think again. Its structures, institutions, and ideas still haunt our world. And one of the defining powers of colonizers always was the way they reserved for themselves (and only themselves) the right to move freely, while also reserving the right to move those they had colonized around like so many chess pieces.

Moving (and moving others) has been inherent in every colonial project. The roots of today's deportation regimes — particularly in the United States, Europe, and Israel — lie in the determination of colonializing countries to wrest wealth from the lands and labor of those they colonized and enjoy that wealth in their own privileged spaces from which the colonized are largely excluded.

The “rules-based world order” that emerged after World War II created institutions for international cooperation and international law, ended colonial empires (as the former colonies gained independence), and dismantled segregation in the United States and, eventually, apartheid in South Africa. But none of that truly or totally erased what had existed before. Global postwar decolonization and the struggle for equality proved to be lengthy and sometimes extremely bloody processes.

In the U.S., people of color are full citizens and can no longer, as a group, be legally enclosed or removed against their will. Europe, too, has dismantled its colonial empires. But the post-colonial world has developed a new form of global apartheid, where the racialized drive to enclose and remove is now directed at immigrants, the vast majority of them escaping the ongoing ravages left by colonialism (and more recently climate change) in their own countries.

Israel is in some ways an anachronism in that twentieth-century trajectory. Its colonizing project was carried out just as other colonized peoples were throwing off their rulers. Its expulsions of Palestinians, which began in the 1940s, have only accelerated in our own time. Meanwhile, Israel created its own legal version of apartheid (even as South Africa's was dismantled), with those Palestinians who were not expelled increasingly surrounded by prisons and walls.

Zionists began to assert the right to expel well before the state of Israel was created in 1948.

In 1895, in an often-quoted passage, Zionism's founder, Theodor Herzl, proposed that “we shall try to spirit the penniless [Arab] population across the border… The removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly.” During the post-World War I British Mandate in Palestine, Zionist, Arab, and British officials agreed that “there could be no viable Jewish state in all or part of Palestine unless there was a mass displacement of Arab inhabitants.”

Palestine's British colonial authorities advocated such a displacement in their 1937 Peel Commission Report. It was then enthusiastically endorsed by Zionist leaders like David Ben-Gurion, later Israel's first prime minister (“The compulsory transfer of the Arabs from the valleys of the proposed Jewish state could give us… an opportunity which we never dared to dream in our wildest imaginings”) and Chaim Weizmann (“If half a million Arabs could be transferred, two million Jews could be put in their place”).

Israel compounded its right to deport with the right to imprison, enclose, and kill. A plethora of laws and walls continue to restrict the return, movement, and residence of Palestinians. Israeli historian Ilan Pappé described the Israeli occupation regime in the West Bank and Gaza since 1967 as having created “the biggest prison on earth.”

In the older settler colonial countries, the days of Trails of Tears, imprisonment on reservations, the forced removal of children to boarding schools, and wars of extermination are mostly in the past. But in Israel, we are witnessing such a project happening before our very eyes. The eliminationist project there is proceeding apace with the tens of thousands killed in Gaza, and in President Trump's and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bald proposals for the complete removal of the Palestinian population from that strip of land, as well as in the restrictions on mobility and the thousands of home demolitions and displacements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

In the United States during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this country ended slavery and enclosure and granted previously enslaved Africans and their descendants, as well as Native Americans, the right to citizenship.

Until after the Civil War, however, “immigrants” meant White Europeans — the only people then allowed to become citizens. Citizenship by birth, mandated by the 14th Amendment after the Civil War, complicated that picture because non-Whites born in U.S. territories also became citizens. To avoid this, the country quickly began to racially restrict immigration. By the late twentieth century, the right to immigrate and more equal rights inside the country were extended to non-Whites. But those rights were always fragile and accompanied by anti-immigrant and deportation campaigns, increasingly justified with the concept of “illegality.”

Developments in the twenty-first century clearly suggest that the arc of history does not necessarily bend toward justice, as a racial deportation regime resurges in a major fashion under President Donald Trump. He, of course, has long distinguished between “shithole countries” and “countries like Norway” as he continues to tighten the screws around most immigrants from Africa, Asia, and Latin America, while recently ostentatiously welcoming White Afrikaaners from South Africa.

The Trump administration's repressive treatment of immigrants includes endless border militarization, the stripping of legal status from hundreds of thousands of immigrants, inventing increasingly draconian excuses for deportation, expanding immigrant incarceration, and pursuing exotic extraterritorial imprisonment and deportation schemes, including pressuring and bribing countries ranging from Costa Rica and Venezuela to Libya and South Sudan to take people forcibly deported from the United States. Others are being disappeared into prisons in Guantánamo and El Salvador.

Strangely — or maybe not so strangely — at the same time that the United States is deporting such “despicable human beings,” it's demanding the extradition of others, including dozens of Mexicans. “The previous Administration allowed these criminals to run free and commit crimes all over the world,” Trump complained. “The United States' intention is to extend its justice system,” a Mexican security analyst explained, so that the U.S. can prosecute Mexicans for crimes committed in Mexico. Forcibly moving people works both ways.

The colonial importation-deportation-incarceration regimes of the United States and Israel are intertwined in many ways. Of course, the U.S. decision to strictly limit Jewish (and other southern and eastern European) immigration in the 1920s contributed to the desperate search of European Jews for refuge in the Hitlerian years to come — and to the growth of Zionism, and the postwar migration to Israel.

The new United Nations — made up primarily of colonizers who had been keen to deport (or, in the case of the United States, make sure they didn't add to) their own Jewish populations — partitioned Palestine to create Israel at the end of 1947. As the only powerful country to emerge from World War II unscathed, the United States would play an outsized role in that organization.

President Trump's proposal to take Gaza and eliminate its population expresses his own (and Israel's) settler-colonial dream for what Australian anthropologist Patrick Wolfe famously called the “elimination of the native.” Trump initially suggested deporting Gaza's population to Egypt and Jordan, then to Sudan, Somalia, and Somaliland, and then to Libya — proposals enthusiastically endorsed by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. By mid-March of this year, Israel was creating a new migration authority to oversee the planned expulsion and 80% of Jewish Israelis found that plan “desirable” (though only 52% thought it was “practical”).

As of late May, none of those countries had accepted Trump's proposal, though negotiations with Libya were evidently ongoing. But Trump's plan to pressure or bribe poorer, weaker countries to accept Palestinian deportees mirrored his deals to deport “unwanteds” from the United States. In addition to the several Latin American countries where his administration has already sent deportees, it is looking to Angola, Benin, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Libya, Moldova, and Rwanda as possibilities. As Secretary of State Marco Rubio explained, “We are working with other countries to say, ‘we want to send you some of the most despicable human beings to your countries…Would you do that, as a favor to us? And the further away from America, the better.'”

Another connection between the deportation regimes of the U.S. and Israel is the way the Trump administration has mobilized charges of antisemitism to imprison and deport Palestinians and their supporters. In ordering the deportation of protester Mahmoud Khalil and others, Rubio claimed that their “condoning antisemitic conduct” undermined American foreign policy objectives.

The United States and Israel share another dystopian project as well: ratcheting up fear and suffering to inspire people to “self-deport.” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem flooded social and other media with a “multimillion dollar ad campaign” threatening immigrants: “Leave now. If you don't, we will find you and we will deport you.” In this respect, MAGA Republicans differed little from liberal Democrats, as Noem was echoing Vice President Kamala Harris's words to Guatemalans: “Don't come… If you do, you will be turned back.” In an eerily similar fashion, on the Israeli-occupied West Bank, “settler advertisements appear on screens and billboards telling Palestinians, ‘There is no future in Palestine.'” Though their tactics differ in scale — the United States is not massacring immigrants and bombing their neighborhoods — they share the goal of eliminating a population.

One apparent difference makes the comparison even more revealing. The United States is aiming its repression at immigrants; Israel against the native population. But the earliest history of deportation in the United States began with the pushing out or slaughtering of the indigenous Native American population in order to clear the land for White settlement. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Africans were forcibly imported to provide labor, many of them even before the U.S. became an independent state. They then remained enslaved and their mobility restricted for almost a century. Colonial control of freedom of movement, in other words, can take different forms over time.

Both the United States and Israel also disproportionately imprison their minoritized populations — another denial of freedom of movement. In the United States, this means people of color. Black people make up 14% of the population but 41% of the prison and jail population. Native Americans are incarcerated at four times the rate of White people. The United States also maintains the world's largest immigrant detention system, with expansion plans already underway.

In Israel, it's Palestinians who are disproportionately imprisoned, both inside that country and in its occupied territories. While Palestinians constitute about 20% of Israel's population, they constitute about 60% of Israel's prisoners. (Such statistics are hard to come by today, so that figure doesn't include the thousands taken prisoner since Oct. 7, 2023.) Many Palestinian prisoners languish in what Israel calls “administrative detention,” a status created for Palestinians that allows lengthy detention without charge.

We are so accustomed to imagining a world of equally sovereign countries, each creating its own immigration policy, that it's easy to miss the colonial dimensions of immigration flows and the ways that colonial histories, immigration restrictions, expulsions, and incarceration are connected. Settler countries like Israel and the United States have particular similarities (and particular connections), but most European powers that have benefited from the world's colonial order now barricade their borders against potential migrants.

Most of the world agrees that apartheid inside a country's borders is the epitome of injustice. Why, then, are we so ready to accept a global version of it?

            As federal authorities stage immigration raids across Los Angeles, local police and officials say they are being kept in the dark — a lack of communication the city's leaders blame for hurting their response to escalating protests.
    


            While California has sanctuary laws that limit police from directly helping immigration enforcement, former federal officials tell CNN there's no prohibition against Immigration and Customs Enforcement sharing basic details about raids with police or government officials.
    


            “We do not know where and when the next raids will be. That is the concern,” L.A. Mayor Karen Bass said on CNN Monday. “When we find out when and where the other raids are going to happen, that will determine how the police respond.”
    


            That kind of information sharing is commonplace in other parts of the country, a CNN review of recent ICE actions found. Experts said those communications can help authorities prepare for the kind of violent clashes that erupted in Southern California over the weekend.
    


            “You've really got to make sure that your state and local partners know when you are doing a large operation just to avoid any potential issues or confusion,” said John Sandweg, a former acting director of ICE during the Obama administration. “There is too much risk. It can lead to officer safety issues due to the confusion.”
    


            The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to multiple requests for comment before publication, but after this story published, a DHS spokesperson disputed Los Angeles city leaders' claims.
    


            In response to Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell's statement that “LAPD was not given advance notice that the federal operations would occur in that area” of Friday's immigration enforcement, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement, “FALSE. The Los Angeles Police Department was notified two days before the ICE operation began in LA.”
    


            McLaughlin did not disclose details of what kind of information DHS shared with LAPD in advance of ICE operations.
    


            McDonnell on Tuesday, asked about McLaughlin's statement, stood by his earlier comments. “Per Chief McDonnell, the Department was not notified,” an LAPD spokesperson told CNN.
    


            Bass also reiterated that point on Tuesday afternoon when asked by reporters about whether federal authorities communicated with police or other local authorities.
    


            “I talked to the chief an hour ago. No, we're not notified of anything,” she said.
    


            Asked when she first learned of the raids on Friday, Bass said she heard about them as the raids were occurring. “I was notified when the raids were happening,” she said.
    


            The US attorney for California's Central District suggested in an interview on Sunday that sanctuary policies were to blame for keeping L.A. law enforcement at arm's length.
    


            “We understand that they are not going to help us in immigration enforcement. We did not seek their assistance for any immigration-related operations,” Bill Essayli told NBC Los Angeles.
    


            ICE generally decides whether to share advance warning of raids on a case-by-case basis, said Kieran Donahue, president of the National Sheriffs' Association.
    


            “In most areas, local agencies work collaboratively with ICE, receiving advance notice of enforcement actions and sometimes even providing support to help ensure public safety,” said Donahue, who is sheriff in Canyon County, Idaho.
    


            Donahue added, “However, in sanctuary jurisdictions like Los Angeles, ICE may refrain from notifying local officials in advance due to concerns that those officials may obstruct or interfere with federal operations.”
    


            Some of the key law enforcement and government agencies in Los Angeles confirmed that they did not receive warnings from ICE about its recent raids, including one on Friday targeting apparel makers in L.A.'s Fashion District. That action, as well as agents setting up a staging area outside a Home Depot in Paramount — a small municipality south of downtown L.A. — led to fiery weekend protests.
    


            McDonnell said because his department was not given advance notice of the ICE operations, “we were not prepositioned to respond immediately to unrest related to those actions.”
    


            LAPD's response was delayed because of an inability to plan for appropriate staffing and equipment, the agency said. By the time the department received a call for help, hundreds of demonstrators had gathered and federal agents had already deployed irritants — creating what an LAPD press release called a “hazardous environment” for officers.
    


            In a statement Saturday, ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said the LAPD took more than two hours to respond to multiple calls for assistance with the unrest. McDonnell said his department responded within 38 minutes.
    


            That lack of advance warning was echoed by Bass and Paramount Mayor Peggy Lemons. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department did not respond to messages about whether the agency had communications in advance with ICE.
    


            Kenneth Gray, a former FBI agent who now teaches criminal justice at the University of New Haven, told CNN that ICE normally gives local law enforcement a heads up in case there is a call for assistance.
    


            “Previously, they would have contacted local law enforcement to say, ‘We're in this area, we are conducting this operation,'” Gray said. “They may not give them a specific address, but they would tell them generally where they were at the time.”
    


            But he said ICE does not have to inform local authorities about such plans, and in cities and states with constraints on cooperation with ICE, Gray said it isn't surprising if they aren't told in advance.
    


            “Their concern, of course, is operational security in that there may be people being informed about ICE activity and be able to avoid being detained,” he said.
    


            The Trump administration's hardline approach to immigration has repeatedly put it at odds with California, a state that has positioned itself as a national leader in protecting undocumented immigrants.
    


            A major flashpoint came in 2017, when the legislature passed the California Values Act, effectively declaring itself a sanctuary state. Barring a few exceptions, the law prohibits local law enforcement agencies from “using money or personnel to investigate, interrogate, detain, detect or arrest persons for immigration enforcement purposes.”
    


            The regulation prompted then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to file a lawsuit arguing that the law obstructed federal immigration policies and enforcement. Federal courts have largely upheld California's sanctuary policies.
    


            Another flareup came in 2018, when then-Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf warned residents that ICE would perform raids around the city the next day. Sessions and the White House denounced her and said her advance warning put ICE officers at risk and allowed violent fugitives to escape.
    


            During both Trump terms, his administration has used executive orders to target sanctuary jurisdictions and threatened to withhold federal dollars.
    


            As Trump has staged an increasingly aggressive push to arrest and deport undocumented immigrants, ICE has raided workplaces and homes across the country. In many cases, local authorities have played a key role — particularly in jurisdictions where sheriff's departments have signed agreements under Trump to assist in immigration enforcement.
    


            Those partnerships have surged in recent months. Since Trump returned to the White House, ICE has signed over 500 agreements with local and state law enforcement agencies to help enforce immigration laws, according to federal data. That's more than three times as many as the total number of agreements signed during Trump's entire first term.
    


            Under some of the agreements, local officers identify inmates in their jails without legal immigration status and coordinate with ICE to begin the deportation process. Other partnerships allow police officers or sheriff's deputies to question and arrest undocumented immigrants in their communities during routine policing activities.
    


            California is one of 10 states without any current agreements between ICE and local or state law enforcement, according to the data.
    


            Press releases issued by ICE in recent weeks highlight the agency's work with authorities in states without sanctuary policies — including Tennessee, Texas, and Florida — on worksite enforcement operations or in executing search warrants.
    


            That hasn't been the case in L.A. this month, according to some local police and city officials who say they have only learned of raids when they're called in to quell conflicts. That's what happened in Paramount on Saturday, the mayor told CNN.
    


            Lemons said there was no communication with federal agents as they staged at a Home Depot. Police only scrambled to action when they learned of growing altercations between protestors and ICE agents.
    


            She emphasized that city officials felt confident in their command structure and local response, adding that sheriff's deputies cleared the streets at the end of the day with no major incidents.
    


            Some experts said California police face a difficult tension between maintaining the trust of undocumented residents and also coming to the aid of federal authorities in trouble.
    


            “For the police chief of Los Angeles, he has two constituencies. On the one hand, he has the community, the citizens of Los Angeles he has the laws to protect,” said Chuck Wexler, the head of the Police Executive Research Forum. “On the other hand, he has a responsibility to support another federal agency, because if those federal agents are overpowered, if they can't maintain order, then you have a public safety issue where either those agents can get hurt or community members can get hurt.”
    


            Wexler added, “It's a delicate balancing act.”

HOUGHTON, Mich. (AP) — Rangers hiked 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) overnight to confirm the deaths of two people who were camping at an island national park in Michigan's Lake Superior, authorities said Tuesday.

“The causes of death are unknown at this time. ... The incident is currently under investigation,” Isle Royale National Park said in a statement.

Two rangers set out Sunday night after park staff was informed that two people were dead at a remote campground. They reached the site Monday.

A phone message left with park authorities seeking more information Tuesday was not immediately returned.

Isle Royale is an extraordinary wilderness park, accessible only by ferry, personal boat or seaplane and only open six months a year due to extreme weather.

The island's population of moose and wolves is regularly studied by wildlife scientists.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has refused to answer questions on the cost of deploying Marines to L.A. when asked by the subcommittee's top Democrat. Rep. Betty McCollum said “this is a deeply unfair position to put our Marines in.“

During an Oval Office engagement with reporters, President Donald Trump left open the possibility of invoking one the most extreme emergency powers in response to immigration protests in Los Angeles. The Insurrection Act authorizes the president to deploy military forces inside the United States to suppress rebellion or domestic violence or to enforce the law in certain situations.

Meanwhile, after persistent questioning from members of Congress on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth‘s acting comptroller, Bryn Woollacott MacDonnell, shared that it would cost $134 million to send the National Guard and Marines to the protests.

Soldiers at Fort Cavazos in Texas had a fun pre-parade assignment: Test if the metal plating planned to protect Washington D.C.'s streets is strong enough for an Abrams. 

The plating will be installed at key points along the parade route to try and prevent the capital's often pot-hole riddled streets from further damage. 

So soldiers at the Texas Army base took an M1 Abrams tank and ran it over that metal plating again and again — importantly through 50 tank turns, which is the movement the Army thinks could cause D.C.'s streets the most damage — to test if if would hold up under the 60-ton tank. 

“Then they picked up the plate –- and the road underneath was pristine,” spokesman Steve Warren told The Associated Press. 

The tanks will roll down Constitution Avenue and past the White House on Saturday to mark the Army's 250th birthday.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Tuesday ordered U.S. embassies around the world to move ahead on a State directive to fire all remaining U.S. Agency for International Development staffers by Sept. 30.

The State Department will take over all foreign assistance programs from USAID by Monday, Rubio said in a cable sent to embassies and viewed by The Associated Press.

Rubio's directive comes after a federal court stay in a broad case by a federal employees union challenging Trump administration mass reductions-in-force in multiple agencies, including the State Department. The plaintiffs say the State Department is violating that stay, though the government denies that.

The president started off his visit to Ft. Bragg with a demonstration of military hardware, including the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, and troops demonstrating a helicopter assault and building raid.

HIMARS, a precision-guided rocket launcher system, are among the most pivotal weapon system the U.S. has provided Ukraine since Russia launched its brutal invasion in February 2022.

President Trump has arrived at the massive military installation in North Carolina to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army to a warmed-up crowd and festive atmosphere.

Artillery, trucks and helicopters are parked on the lawn, along with inflatable slides and attractions for children. Near a security checkpoint — but still on the base — vendors set up two stands selling Trump campaign paraphernalia like hats and shirts.

Pro wrestlers, including the WWE's Cody Rhodes, worked the crowd before Trump's arrival.

“WWE will always, always support our troops” Rhodes said

Secretary of Army Dan Driscoll praised Trump as “the greatest recruiter in our army's history.”

There is a “resurgence of pride” in America. “It's real. I can feel it,” Driscoll said.

“We are here not just as Californians but as Americans who are concerned with the direction of our country,” said Rep. Jimmy Gomez, who represents the Los Angeles area.

The Democrats warned during a press conference at the U.S. Capitol that Trump's decision to send the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles is inciting chaos, potentially setting the stage for his wider actions.

“We are at a dangerous inflection point in our country,” Gomez said. “In a democracy, civil disobedience isn't met with military force. But that's exactly what Trump is doing.”

He said, “If it can happen in Los Angeles, it can happen in any state in the union.

”Rep. Nanette Barragan, whose district includes the city of Paramount, said, “Listen to the words of this administration: They're using words like insurrection. They're using words like invasion.”

Barragan warned: “I believe this is their way to lay down the groundwork to try to have martial law and invoke the insurrection act. “That's a concern,” she said, explaining such an order could encompass the entire country. “That is dangerous. It's wrong.”

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem on Tuesday accused Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum of inciting violence in Los Angeles protests, despite the Mexican leader repeatedly calling on protesters to act peacefully.

“Claudia Sheinbaum came out and encouraged more protests in LA and I condemn her for that. She should not be encouraging violent protests that are going on,” Noem said during an appearance in the Oval Office on Tuesday.

The accusation invoked a strong response from Sheinbaum, who called the claims “absolutely false,” in a post on the social media platform X. Sheinbaum posted a video from her morning press briefing in which she called for peaceful protests, referring to Noem's comments as a “misunderstanding.”

“We do not agree with violent actions as a form of protest, the burning of patrol cars seems more an act of provocation than resistance, it should be clear, we condemn violence, wherever it comes from, we call on the Mexican community to act peacefully and not fall into provocations,” she said in the press briefing.

In her response to Noem, Sheinbaum added that she will “continue to defend honest, hard working Mexicans who support the United States economy,” and called for “dialogue and respect.”

Hey, Charles. Thanks for your question. The full bill can be found on Congress's website. There, you can read the bill in its entirety as well as a summary of what's in it.

If it's still a bit confusing (we don't blame you), AP's Kevin Freking and Lisa Mascaro wrote their own breakdown of the bill. Here are some of the highlights of its contents. (One big caveat: the bill is expected to change before final votes).

Vice President JD Vance met at the Capitol on Tuesday with Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, according to a person familiar with the meeting who was not authorized to speak publicly.

Johnson is a Republican who has been very critical of Trump's bill to cut taxes and spending, arguing the legislation does not do enough to cut government spending.

Vance and Johnson discussed the bill and the White House is optimistic that there's a path to getting Johnson to support the bill, according to the person, but it was not clear what that path would look like.

The host of an online prank show tells The Associated Press that a Craigslist ad seeking “the toughest badasses in the city” was an unrelated joke and was not intended to make light of demonstrations in Los Angeles.

Viral social media posts falsely claimed the ad was proof the Los Angeles demonstrations are made up of paid protestors.

The ad, which is no longer live, was bait for a prank show called “Goofcon1” and had nothing to do with the protests in Los Angeles. It was posted on Craigslist on Thursday, the day before the protests began.

In a livestreamed episode, the show's hosts on Friday called and spoke with people who responded to the ad. Joey LaFleur, one of Goofcon1's hosts, confirmed with The Associated Press that he put up the Craigslist ad for the show.

“I literally had no idea it was ever going to be connected to the riots,” LaFleur told AP, referencing the ad. “It was a really weird coincidence. I'm not trying to troll a serious situation.”

Rep. David Valadao, a moderate Republican who represents much of the state's San Joaquin Valley, expressed concern over the scenes in Los Angeles and urged for peaceful protest. 

He added that he had expressed concerns to the Trump administration over how it is conducting ICE raids in the Golden state.

“I support the First Amendment right to peacefully protest, but the violence and vandalism happening in Los Angeles is unacceptable and I stand with our law enforcement officers working to protect people and regain control over the situation,” Valadao wrote on social media. 

“I remain concerned about ongoing ICE operations throughout CA and will continue my conversations with the administration — urging them to prioritize the removal of known criminals over the hardworking people who have lived peacefully in the Valley for years.”

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard says artificial intelligence accelerated the release of thousands of pages of previously classified documents relating to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.

Experts had predicted the process could take many months or even years, but AI was able to quickly scan for any material that should remain classified, Gabbard told the audience at the Amazon Web Services summit Tuesday.

“We have been able to do that through the use of AI tools far more quickly than what was done previously — which was to have humans go through and look at every single one of these pages,” Gabbard said.

Trump said he isn't worried about things getting out of hand with the military on the ground in Los Angeles.

Asked if he was concerned, Trump said, “No, it's OK.”

How long will National Guard troops will stay in Los Angeles?

“Until there's no danger,” Trump said. “When there's no danger, they'll leave.”

The president during his Oval Office engagement with reporters left open the possibility of invoking one the most extreme emergency powers available to a U.S. president.

“If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We'll see,” Trump said. “But I can tell you last night was terrible , and the night before that was terrible.”

The Insurrection Act authorizes the president to deploy military forces inside the United States to suppress rebellion or domestic violence or to enforce the law in certain situations.

It is often referred to as the “Insurrection Act of 1807,” but the law is actually an amalgamation of different statutes enacted by Congress between 1792 and 1871.

The president told reporters in the Oval Office that he wants the country to “wean off” of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 

Trump has been critical of FEMA over the last year and has spread misinformation about it, especially regarding its assistance in North Carolina in the wake of Hurricane Helene.

Trump said disaster management is meant to be handled by governors.

“We're moving it back to the states so the governors can handle it,” he said. “That's why they're governors. Now, if they can't handle it, they shouldn't be governor.”

Trump last month pushed out the acting head of FEMA after the administrator testified before Congress that he disagreed with dismantling the agency.

The event wasn't on Trump's public schedule, but the Agriculture and Homeland Security secretaries talked about fighting wildfires and hurricanes.

The president has cut firefighting crews and also wants to eliminate FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Administration and give states more responsibility for responding to hurricanes.

Sanders, who was press secretary in Trump's first term, is meeting with administration officials at the White House.

She backs Trump sending the National Guard into Los Angeles without approval from California's governor and was asked if she'd be OK with a similar move in her state.

“If we needed help, I would be making the phone call myself to the president and asking for his assistance. But in Arkansas, we would never allow to take place what they're letting to go on in California. But if we needed help, the president would be one of the first people I would call because he is somebody I know who cares deeply about making sure the American people are safe and secure first and foremost.”

And she says she's working to speed up the delivery of the intelligence information to address a key complaint from policy makers.

Speaking at the Amazon Web Services summit in Washington, Gabbard said the pace of intelligence work frustrated her as a member of Congress and continues to be a challenge to lawmakers.

“They still express a lot of the same frustrations that I felt — that much of what we were briefed on was already reported in a newspaper … and that even if it was quality reporting it was coming too late,” Gabbard said.

Artificial intelligence and computing could help speed up the work, Gabbard said, to ensure lawmakers have the information they need.

“We stated very publicly that it's 60 days because we want to ensure that those rioters, looters and thugs on the other side assaulting our police officers know that we're not going anywhere,” Hegseth told members of the House appropriations defense subcommittee.

Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, right, accompanied by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine, testifies before the House Committee on Appropriations subcommittee oversight hearing on the Department of Defense, on Capitol Hill.



The current cost estimate for the deployment is $134 million, which is largely just the cost of travel, housing and food,” said Bryn Woollacott MacDonnell, special assistant to the secretary of defense who's currently performing the duties of the Pentagon's top financial officer.

That could mean Kyiv will receive fewer critical air defense systems in the future that have been key to countering a continuous onslaught of Russian missiles.

“It is a reduction in this budget,” Hegseth told lawmakers. “This administration takes a very different view of that conflict. We believe that a negotiated peaceful settlement is in the best interest of both parties and our nation's interests, especially with all the competing interests around the globe.”

The U.S. to date has provided Ukraine more than $66 billion in aid since Russia invaded in February 2022.

And he echoed the president's attacks on Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

“That's not my lane,” Johnson said in response to a question about whether Newsom should face legal consequences such as arrest.

Johnson, speaking at a news conference at the RNC on Tuesday, continued that Newsom should be “tarred and feathered”— eliciting chuckles from members of House Republican leadership at the news conference — for “standing in the way of the administration and the carrying out of federal law.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Tuesday there were “clear failures on the part of state and local officials” in response to protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles and a “federal response” was necessary.

President Trump has sent thousands of National Guard troops and 700 active duty Marines to quell the protests despite the objections of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and local leaders.

“I don't know exactly the authorities that they are using,” Thune said, referring to the Marine deployment. “But obviously, there was a security situation out there that needed to be addressed. And I think ultimately the president's objective is to keep people safe.”

“I think we're entering another phase, especially under President Trump with his focus on the homeland, where the National Guard and reserves become a critical component of how we secure that homeland,” Hegseth told lawmakers.

Hegseth earlier refused to answer a lawmaker's questions on how much a deployment of active duty U.S. Marines to Los Angeles will cost.

After the activist joined a flotilla seeking to break Israel's blockade of Gaza and bring humanitarian aid to Palestinians, the U.S. president described Thunberg as a ''young, angry person.'' He said she should go to ''anger management class.''

Thunberg was detained then deported by Israel on Tuesday and sent to Paris.

Asked upon arrival about Trump's comments, she replied in a matter-of-fact tone: “I think the world needs a lot more young angry women to be honest. Especially with everything going on right now.”

Gen. Eric Smith testified at a budget hearing before senators that those Marines are trained for crowd control and they would have shields and batons as their equipment. He said they have no arrest authority and are only there to protect federal property and federal personnel.

When asked by Sen. Richard Blumental, a Connecticut Democrat, about the danger Marines would use lethal force that could result in injuries and deaths, Smith said he had faith in them.

“I am not concerned. I have great faith in my Marines and their junior leaders and their more senior leaders to execute the lawful tasks that they are given.”

The attack in early June that destroyed a large number of Russian bomber aircraft caught the U.S. off guard and represented significant advances in drone warfare, Hegseth told lawmakers Tuesday.

The attack has the Pentagon rethinking drone defenses “so we are not vulnerable to a threat and an attack like that,” Hegseth told the House appropriations subcommittee on defense.

Hegseth said the Pentagon “is learning everyday from Ukraine,” and focused on how to better defend its own military airfields.

In a back an forth with the defense appropriations subcommittee's top Democrat, Hegseth refused to answer basic questions on the cost of deploying Marines to Los Angeles, instead falling back on political talking points.

In a series of questions on the news that Marines would be sent to Los Angeles, House Appropriations defense subcommittee ranking member Rep. Betty McCollum told Hegseth “this is a deeply unfair position to put our Marines in,” she said. “There's no need for the Marines to be deployed.”

McCollum asked what the cost of the deployment would be. Hegseth deflected on the costs, attacked the decisions of the previous Biden administration instead and talked about illegal immigration.

“Could the Secretary please address the budget” McCollum asked him.

Hegseth again refused to acknowledge McCollum's question and attacked the politics of the past administration again. McCollum took back her time and Hegseth was instructed by the committee chairman to provide the costs in writing instead.

Democratic members of California's congressional delegation are accusing the president of creating a “manufactured crisis” in Los Angeles with his orders to send in thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines.

“It's a deliberate attempt by Trump to incite unrest, test the limits of executive power and distract from the lawlessness of his administration,” said Rep. Jimmy Gomez, who organized a news conference at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday morning.

Rep. Jimmy Panetta said Trump's decision to send in the military was designed to “give him the image and give him the fight and give him the pictures that he wants.“

Rep. Nancy Pelosi contrasted Trump's actions now with his handling of the Jan. 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol when law enforcement officers were being beaten.

“We begged the president of the United States to send in the National Guard. He would not do it,” Pelosi said.

Based on his opening remarks in his first appearance before lawmakers since taking office, there's been nothing but smooth sailing in the defense chief's office.

Hegseth completed his opening statement with no mention of his controversial use of Signal, of the lack of defense budget details to guide Congress, or his controversial firings of his own staff or military leaders.

Hegseth also made no mention of a decision to deploy Marines into Los Angeles to respond to immigration raid protests. Instead, he clung closely to the talking points he's used since taking office, such as emphasizing that “DEI is dead,” and that he's focused on a return to “lethality.”

Trump's defense chief faced a litany of questions on what some lawmakers called “rash” or “reckless” decisions or actions dating back to his first day in office, as Tuesday's hearing before the House Appropriations defense subcommittee began.

In opening statements, lawmakers asked about Hegseth's decisions to fire top military leaders, his use of Signal and other controversies, including his firing of several staff members in his inner circle.

“The Department of Defense is mired in controversy and chaos,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the ranking member of the full committee.

President Trump's trade wars are expected to slash economic growth this year in the United States and around the world, the World Bank forecast Tuesday.

Citing “a substantial rise in trade barriers'' but without mentioning Trump by name, the 189-country lender predicted that the U.S. economy — the world's largest — would grow half as fast (1.4%) this year as it did in 2024 (2.8%). That marked a downgrade from the 2.3% U.S. growth it had forecast back for 2025 back in January.

The bank also lopped 0.4 percentage points off its forecast for global growth this year. It now expects the world economy to expand just 2.3% in 2025, down from 2.8% in 2024.

Trump said his decision to “SEND IN THE TROOPS” to Los Angeles spared the city from burning to the ground like thousands of homes after wildfires this year.

He wrote on his social media site that people want to rebuild, and that the federal permitting process is “virtually complete on these houses.”

Trump claimed “the easy and simple City and State Permits are disastrously bungled up and WAY BEHIND SCHEDULE!” and blamed California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.

“People want to rebuild their houses. Call your incompetent Governor and Mayor, the Federal permitting is DONE!!!” he wrote.



He's expected to field sharp questions from members of Congress about his tumultuous start as Pentagon chief, including his sharing of sensitive military details over a Signal chat, in three separate Capitol Hill hearings beginning Tuesday.

Lawmakers also have made it clear they're unhappy that Hegseth hasn't provided details on the administration's first proposed defense budget, which Trump has said would total $1 trillion, a significant increase over the current spending level of more than $800 billion.

It will be lawmakers' first chance to ask Hegseth about a myriad of other controversial spending by the Pentagon, including plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on security upgrades to turn a Qatari jet into Air Force One and to pour as much as $45 million into a parade recently added to the Army's 250th birthday bash, which happens to coincide with Trump's birthday on Saturday.

Kennedy on Monday removed every member of a scientific committee that advises the CDC on how to use vaccines and pledged to replace them with his own picks.

Major physicians and public health groups criticized the move to oust all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

Kennedy, who was one of the nation's leading anti-vaccine activists before becoming the nation's top health official, has not said who he would appoint to the panel, but said it would convene in just two weeks in Atlanta.

Although it's typically not viewed as a partisan board, the entire current roster of committee members were Biden appointees.

Trump made no secret of his willingness to take a maximalist approach to enforcing immigration laws and keeping order as he campaigned to return to the White House. The fulfillment of that pledge is now on full display in Los Angeles.

By overriding California's Gov. Gavin Newsom, Trump is already going beyond what he did to respond to Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, when he warned he could send troops to contain demonstrations that turned violent if governors in the states did not act to do so themselves. Trump said in September of that year that he “can't call in the National Guard unless we're requested by a governor” and that “we have to go by the laws.”

But now, he's moving swiftly to test the bounds of his executive authority in order to deliver on his promise of mass deportations. What remains to be seen is whether Americans will stand by him once it's operationalized nationwide. For now, Trump is betting that they will.

Trump plans to speak at Fort Bragg on Tuesday to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army as he deploys the military in an attempt to quiet immigration protests in Los Angeles.

Fort Bragg, located near Fayetteville, North Carolina, serves as headquarters for U.S. Army Special Operations Command. Highly trained units like the Green Berets and the Rangers are based there.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll will also be at Tuesday's event, along with service members, veterans and their families.

Trump has promoted the Army's anniversary as a reason to hold a military parade in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, which is also his 79th birthday.

Trump, who sees the military as a critical tool for domestic goals, has used the recent protests in Los Angeles as an opportunity to deploy the National Guard and U.S. Marines to quell disturbances that began as protests over immigration raids.

California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed an emergency motion in federal court to block National Guard members and Marines from assisting with immigration raids in Los Angeles. “Trump is turning the U.S. military against American citizens,” Newsom wrote on X. 

President Donald Trump originally deployed the Guard to protect federal buildings and personnel. The governor's request says the Guard will start supporting immigration activities.

▶ Follow live updates on the Trump administration

California Gov. Gavin Newsom filed an emergency request in federal court Tuesday to block the Trump administration from using the National Guard and Marines to assist with immigration raids in Los Angeles.

Newsom's move comes after President Donald Trump ordered the deployment of roughly 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angles following four days of protests driven by anger over the president's stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws.

The governor's request said it was in response to a change in orders for the Guard.

The filing included a declaration from Paul Eck, deputy general counsel in the California Military Department. Eck said the department has been informed that the Pentagon plans to direct the California National Guard to start providing support for immigration operations. That support would include holding secure perimeters around areas where raids are taking place and securing streets for immigration agents.

The Guard members were originally deployed to protect federal buildings.

It was not clear if the change in mission had begun.

Newsom's office did not immediately say how the state was notified about the change.

96 of the arrests were for failing to disperse in the downtown Los Angeles area, where earlier in the day, hundreds had hoisted signs protesting the arrest of a labor leader during a demonstration, the Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement.

One person was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon and another for vandalism. Two police officers were injured, taken to a hospital and released. 

The police department said their officers used “numerous” less-lethal rounds, and that the crowd had thinned out by the early hours of Tuesday morning.

The Los Angeles mayor said her administration has heard the ICE raids could continue for the next 30 days, if not longer. 

“It's a sense of intimidation and fear that is just so unnecessary and so corrosive to our city,” Bass said at a Tuesday news conference. The mayor said she would place a call to President Trump asking him to stop the raids.

Bass scoffed at Trump's claim on Saturday that the National Guard helped protect the city, especially because they didn't even arrive until Sunday. She said Guard troops are “stationary,” protecting the LA federal building. 

“They are not out doing crowd control or anything like that. So I don't know how he could say that the National Guard is who saved the day. Who saved the day was our local law enforcement agencies,” Bass said.

The ceremonies, which number over 100 between Monday and Tuesday alone, included a beefed up presence of school police “to intervene and interfere with any federal agency who may want to take action during these joyous times,” said Alberto M. Carvalho, the superintendent of Los Angeles' school district, at a press conference this week.

Carvalho asked parents to update their emergency contact information in case something goes awry and is offering them an option to view the graduations over Zoom. 

“Our schools are places of education and inspiration, not fear and intimidation,” said Carvalho.

Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis said four officers who were injured during Monday night's protests have been treated and released from a hospital by Tuesday. 

Three officers were hurt by what she described as “very large” rocks that were thrown at police. The fourth officer injured a shoulder while making an arrest. 

Davis said Austin police deployed pepper spray balls and that state police used tear gas to disperse the crowd once it started to turn violent. Davis said her department is prepared for protests that are planned for downtown Austin this upcoming weekend.

“We support peaceful protest,” Davis said. “When that protests turn violent, when it turns to throwing rocks and bottles .... That will not be tolerated. Arrests will be made.”

Rep. David Valadao, a moderate Republican who represents much of the state's San Joaquin Valley, urged for peaceful protest and said he was also concerned over how the Trump administration is conducting ICE raids in the Golden state.

“I support the First Amendment right to peacefully protest, but the violence and vandalism happening in Los Angeles is unacceptable and I stand with our law enforcement officers working to protect people and regain control over the situation,” Valadao wrote on social media.

“I remain concerned about ongoing ICE operations throughout CA and will continue my conversations with the administration—urging them to prioritize the removal of known criminals over the hardworking people who have lived peacefully in the Valley for years,” he added.

Viral social media posts are claiming that a Craigslist ad seeking “the toughest badasses in the city” is proof that the Los Angeles demonstrations are made up of paid protestors.

But this is false.

The ad, which is no longer live, was bait for a prank show called “Goofcon1"" and had nothing to do with the protests in Los Angeles. It was posted on Craigslist on Thursday, the day before the protests began. 

In a livestreamed episode, the show's hosts on Friday called and spoke with people who responded to the ad. Joey LaFleur, one of Goofcon1's hosts, confirmed with The Associated Press that he put up the Craigslist ad for the show.

“I literally had no idea it was ever going to be connected to the riots. It was a really weird coincidence,” he said, referencing the ad. “I'm not trying to troll a serious situation.”

The president during his Oval Office engagement with reporters left open the possibility of invoking one the most extreme emergency powers available to a U.S. president.

“If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We'll see,” Trump said. “But I can tell you last night was terrible, and the night before that was terrible.”

The Insurrection Act authorizes the president to deploy military forces inside the United States to suppress rebellion or domestic violence or to enforce the law in certain situations.

It is often referred to as the “Insurrection Act of 1807,” but the law is actually an amalgamation of different statutes enacted by Congress between 1792 and 1871.

About 50 people gathered outside the immigration court in downtown Seattle on Tuesday, chanting with drums and holding up signs that said “Free Them All Abolish ICE” and “No to Deportations.” 

Legal advocates who normally attend the immigration court hearings as observers and to provide support to immigrants were not allowed inside the building. Security guards also turned away the media. 

The hearings are normally open to the public. Organizers said they were there solidarity with protesters in Los Angeles. 

The protest was peaceful and there were no law-enforcement officers in the area in the morning. 

Although most have been peaceful with marchers chanting and carrying signs, some have resulted in dozens of arrests.

The demonstrations have ranged from gatherings outside of federal office buildings or state capitol buildings, and marches through the downtown of several major cities. A series of so-called “No Kings” rallies were planned Saturday to coincide with President Trump's scheduled military parade in Washington, DC.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on social media on Tuesday that the agency would continue its program of raids and deportations despite the protests.

“ICE will continue to enforce the law,” Noem posted on X.

In Santa Ana, California, armored vehicles blocked the road Tuesday morning leading into the Civic Center, where federal immigration officers and numerous city and county agencies have their offices. 

Workers swept up plastic bottles and broken glass. Tiny shards of red, black and purple glass littered the pavement. 

Nearby buildings and the sidewalk were tagged with graffiti containing obscenities and Trump's name crossed out. A worker rolled paint over graffiti on a wall to block it out. National Guard officers wearing fatigues and carrying rifles prevented people from entering the area unless they worked there.

A handful of National Guard members are stationed in front of the Metropolitan Detention Center, long guns and wood sticks slung over their shoulders. Occasionally, a passing driver will honk at or heckle them, drawing no response. 

News crews are stationed on the opposite side of the street, awaiting the possible arrival of the U.S. Marines. Otherwise, there are few signs of the tumult that has gripped the city in recent nights, aside from the graffiti scrawled across several buildings – “Abolish ICE,” “Amerikkka,” and obscene slogans directed at Trump and federal law enforcement. 

At the Walt Disney Concert Hall, workers were busy washing away the graffiti on Tuesday morning.

The deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles will cost at least $134 million and last at least the next 60 days, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and a senior defense official told lawmakers Tuesday.

“We stated very publicly that it's 60 days because we want to ensure that those rioters, looters and thugs on the other side assaulting our police officers know that we're not going anywhere,” Hegseth told members of the House appropriations defense subcommittee.

After persistent questioning from members of Congress, Hegseth turned to his acting comptroller, Bryn Woollacott MacDonnell, who provided the total and said this “is largely just the cost of travel, housing and food.”

She said the money will come from operations and maintenance accounts.

House Speaker Mike Johnson defended Donald Trump's handling of protests in Los Angeles and echoed the president's attacks on Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.

“That's not my lane,” Johnson said in response to a question about whether Newsom should face legal consequences such as arrest.

Johnson, speaking at a news conference at the RNC on Tuesday, continued that Newsom should be “tarred and feathered”-- eliciting chuckles from members of House Republican leadership at the press conference -- for “standing in the way of the administration and the carrying out of federal law.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Tuesday there were “clear failures on the part of state and local officials” in response to protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles and a “federal response” was necessary.

President Trump has sent thousands of National Guard troops and 700 active duty Marines to quell the protests despite the objections of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and local leaders.

“I don't know exactly the authorities that they are using,” Thune said, referring to the Marine deployment. “But obviously, there was a security situation out there that needed to be addressed. And I think ultimately the president's objective is to keep people safe.”



The commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Eric Smith, said the battalion deployed to Los Angeles is already there and ready to follow the orders from the U.S. Northern Command, but clarified they have not yet been called to respond. 

Smith testified at a budget hearing before senators that those Marines are trained for crowd control, and they would have shields and batons as their equipment. He said they have no arrest authority, and are only there to protect federal property and federal personnel.

When asked by U.S. Sen. Richard Blumental, a Connecticut Democrat, about the danger that Marines would use lethal force that could result in injuries and deaths, Smith said he had faith in them.

“I am not concerned. I have great faith in my Marines and their junior leaders and their more senior leaders to execute the lawful tasks that they are given.”

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott posted on social media that “more than a dozen protesters” were arrested by city and state police in Austin.

“Peaceful protesting is legal,” Abbott, a Republican, posted on X. “But once you cross the line, you will be arrested.”

Hundreds of protestors organized by the Austin chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation gathered near the Capitol on Monday, and moved toward the federal building that houses an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office. State officials had closed the Capitol to the public an hour earlier than usual head of the demonstration.

In Dallas, hundreds of demonstrators gathered for a rally on a city bridge for several hours before police later determined the rally to be “unlawful.” Dallas police said one person was arrested and charges were pending.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File)



DeSantis has often clashed with California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who like DeSantis is a term-limited governor with national ambitions.

“You don't have the right to just simply opt out of federal immigration law. And I think what's happened in California is they're a sanctuary state. They've taken the position really uninterrupted for many, many years that they can just ignore the law, they don't have to cooperate. Well now you have the law being applied,” DeSantis said at a Florida Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

DeSantis said law enforcement officers in Florida are ready to crack down if demonstrations there boil over into riots.

“The minute you cross into attacking law enforcement, any type of rioting, any type of vandalism, looting, just be prepared to have the law come down on you,” DeSantis added. “And we will make an example of you, you can guarantee it.”

In a back an forth with the defense appropriations subcommittee's top Democrat, Hegseth refused to answer basic questions on the cost of deploying Marines to Los Angeles, instead falling back on political talking points.

In a series of questions on the news that Marines would be sent to Los Angeles, House Appropriations defense subcommittee ranking member Rep. Betty McCollum told Hegseth “this is a deeply unfair position to put our Marines in,” she said. “There's no need for the Marines to be deployed.”

McCollum asked what the cost of the deployment would be. Hegseth deflected on the costs, attacked the decisions of the previous Biden administration instead and talked about illegal immigration.

“Could the Secretary please address the budget” McCollum asked him.

Hegseth again refused to acknowledge McCollum's question and attacked the politics of the past administration again. 

McCollum took back her time and Hegseth was instructed by the committee chairman to provide the costs in writing instead.

Democratic members of California's congressional delegation are accusing Trump of creating a “manufactured crisis” in Los Angeles with his orders to send in thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines.

“It's a deliberate attempt by Trump to incite unrest, test the limits of executive power and distract from the lawlessness of his administration,” said Rep. Jimmy Gomez, who organized a press conference at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday morning.

Rep. Jimmy Panetta said that Trump's decision to send the military was designed to “give him the image and give him the fight and give him the pictures that he wants.“ Panetta said the delegation would stand with peaceful protesters, but those who are not peaceful are going to pay the consequences.

Rep. Nancy Pelosi contrasted Trump's actions now with his handling of the Jan. 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol when law enforcement officers were being beaten.

“We begged the president of the United States to send in the National Guard. He would not do it,” Pelosi said.

Trump said his decision to “SEND IN THE TROOPS” to Los Angeles spared the city from burning to the ground like thousands of homes after wildfires this year.

He wrote on his social media site that people want to rebuild, and that the federal permitting process is “virtually complete on these houses.”

Trump claimed that “the easy and simple City and State Permits are disastrously bungled up and WAY BEHIND SCHEDULE!” and blamed California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.

“People want to rebuild their houses. Call your incompetent Governor and Mayor, the Federal permitting is DONE!!!” he wrote.

The Pentagon was scrambling Monday to establish rules to guide U.S. Marines who could be faced with the rare and difficult prospect of using force against citizens on American soil, now that the Trump administration is deploying active duty troops to the immigration raid protests in Los Angeles.

The forces have been trained in deescalation, crowd control and standing rules for the use of force, Northern Command said.

But the use of the active duty forces still raises difficult questions.

The Marines are highly trained in combat and crisis response. But that is starkly different from the role they will face now: They could potentially be hit by protesters carrying gas canisters and have to quickly decide how to respond or face decisions about protecting an immigration enforcement agent from crowds.

According to a U.S. official, troops will be armed with their normal service weapons but will not be carrying tear gas. They also will have protective equipment such as helmets, shields and gas masks.

This isn't the image Los Angeles wanted projected around the globe.

Clouds of tear gas wafting over a throng of protesters on a blocked freeway. Federal immigration agents in tactical garb raiding businesses in search of immigrants without legal status. A messy war of words between Trump and Newsom. Photos captured several Waymo robotaxis set on fire and graffiti scrawled on a federal detention center building, while videos recorded the sounds of rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades hitting crowds.

In a city still reeling from January's deadly wildfires — and with the World Cup soccer championships and the 2028 Olympics on the horizon — Mayor Karen Bass has been urging residents to come together to revitalize LA's image by sprucing up streets, planting trees and painting murals so LA shows its best face to nations near and far.

“It's about pride,” she's said. “This is the city of dreams.”

The deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.

The last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

In a directive Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”

On Monday, thousands flooded the streets around City Hall for a union rally ahead of a hearing for arrested labor leader David Huerta, who was freed a few hours later on a $50,000 bond. Huerta's arrest Friday while protesting immigration raids has become a rallying cry for people angry over the administration's crackdown. He is the president of the Service Employees International Union California, which represents thousands of the state's janitors, security officers and other workers.

Early protests had a calm and even joyful atmosphere at times, with people dancing to live music and buoyed by Huerta's release.

Protesters linked hands in front of a line of police officers outside the downtown federal detention center where Huerta was being held. Religious leaders joined the protesters, working with organizers at times to de-escalate moments of tension.

There was a heavy law enforcement presence in the few square blocks, while most in the immense city of some 4 million people went about their normal business on peaceful streets.

Another 2,000 National Guard troops along with 700 Marines are headed to Los Angeles on orders from President Donald Trump, escalating a military presence local officials and Newsom don't want and the police chief says creates logistical challenges for safely handling protests.

An initial 2,000 Guard troops ordered by Trump started arriving Sunday, which saw the most violence during three days of protests.

Monday's demonstrations were far less raucous, with thousands peacefully attending a rally at City Hall and hundreds protesting outside a federal complex that includes a detention center where some immigrants are being held following workplace raids across the city.

Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth. They say he is putting public safety at risk by adding military personnel even though police say they don't need the help.

Newsom called the deployments reckless and “disrespectful to our troops” in a post on the social platform X.

Another 2,000 National Guard troops along with 700 Marines are headed to Los Angeles on orders from President Donald Trump, escalating a military presence local officials have said creates logistical challenges for safely handling protests.

President Donald Trump has authorized the deployment of an additional 2,000 National Guard members to respond to immigration protests in Los Angeles, according to the Pentagon's chief spokesperson. Mayor Karen Bass criticized the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines as a “deliberate attempt” by the Trump administration to “create disorder and chaos in our city.”

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth suggests that National Guard troop use for homeland defense will expand under President Donald Trump. He spoke as more than 4,000 National Guard troops had been sent to L.A. in response to immigration raid protests.

Protests were held in Austin and Dallas, Texas over immigration raids in Los Angeles.

Protests took place in pockets across Los Angeles over several days after the Trump administration stepped up immigration control efforts in the city. In an unprecedented move, U.S. President Donald Trump deployed National Guard troops, a move strongly criticised by the city's officials and the Governor of California Gavin Newsom.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom filed an emergency request in federal court Tuesday to block the Trump administration from using the National Guard and Marines to assist with immigration raids in Los Angeles.

Newsom's move comes after President Donald Trump ordered the deployment of roughly 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angles following protests driven by anger over the president's stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws.

The governor's request said it was in response to a change in orders for the Guard.

The filing included a declaration from Paul Eck, deputy general counsel in the California Military Department. Eck said the department has been informed that the Pentagon plans to direct the California National Guard to start providing support for immigration operations. That support would include holding secure perimeters around areas where raids are taking place and securing streets for immigration agents.

AP correspondent Ed Donahue reports on President Trump defending the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles.

The Guard members were originally deployed to protect federal buildings.

It was not clear if the change in mission had begun.

Newsom's office did not immediately say how the state was notified about the change.




In other developments Tuesday, the Marine Corps commandant said the Marines that deployed to the Los Angeles area on Trump's orders have not yet been called to respond to the protests and are there only to protect federal officials and property, 

The 700 Marines and another 2,000 National Guard troops were ordered to LA on Monday, escalating a military presence that local officials and Gov. Gavin Newsom do not want and that the police chief says makes it harder to handle the protests safely.

Marine Corps Gen. Eric Smith told a budget hearing on Capitol Hill that the battalion has not yet been sent to any protests. The Marines were trained for crowd control but have no arrest authority and are there to protect government property and personnel, he said.

Trump left open the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act, which authorizes the president to deploy military forces inside the U.S. to suppress rebellion or domestic violence or to enforce the law in certain situations. It's one of the most extreme emergency powers available to a U.S. president.

“If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We'll see,” he said Tuesday from the Oval Office. “But I can tell you last night was terrible, and the night before that was terrible.”

Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth. 

While protesters blocked a major freeway and set cars on fire over the weekend, the demonstrations in the city of 4 million people have largely been centered in several blocks of downtown. On Monday, they were far less raucous, with thousands of people peacefully attending a rally at City Hall and hundreds more protesting outside a federal complex that includes a detention center where some immigrants are being held following workplace raids across the city.

At daybreak Tuesday, guard troops were stationed outside the detention center, but there was no sign of the Marines.

Obscene slogans directed at Trump and federal law enforcement remained scrawled across several buildings. At the Walt Disney Concert Hall, workers were busy washing away graffiti Tuesday morning.

In nearby Santa Ana, armored guard vehicles blocked a road leading to federal immigration and government offices. Workers swept up plastic bottles and broken glass near buildings sprayed with graffiti.

Sending in the military is the latest step in the administration's immigration crackdown as Trump pursues the mass deportations he promised last year during the presidential campaign. The protests have been driven by anger over the stepped-up enforcement that critics say is breaking apart migrant families.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth suggested Tuesday that the use of troops inside the U.S. will continue to expand.

“I think we're entering another phase, especially under President Trump with his focus on the homeland, where the National Guard and Reserves become a critical component of how we secure that homeland,” he said on Capitol Hill.

The mayor and the governor say Trump is putting public safety at risk by adding military personnel even though police say they don't need the help.

Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said he was confident in the police department's ability to handle large-scale demonstrations and that the Marines' arrival without coordinating with the police department would present a “significant logistical and operational challenge.”

Newsom called the deployments reckless on the social platform X. “This isn't about public safety,” the governor said. “It's about stroking a dangerous President's ego.”

The protests began Friday after federal immigration authorities arrested more than 40 people across Los Angeles and continued over the weekend as crowds blocked a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire. Police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades.

Demonstrations spread Monday to other cities nationwide, including San Francisco and Santa Ana, California, as well as Dallas and Austin, Texas. Authorities in Austin said police used pepper spray balls and tear gas to disperse a crowd that threw rocks and bottles at officers, injuring four.

The Pentagon said deploying the National Guard and Marines costs $134 million. That figure came out Tuesday just after Hegseth engaged in a testy back-and-forth about the costs during a congressional hearing.

The defense secretary said the department has a budget increase and the money to cover the costs, and he defended Trump's decision to send the troops, saying they are needed to protect federal agents doing their jobs.

Meanwhile, Democratic members of California's congressional delegation on Tuesday accused the president of creating a “manufactured crisis” with his orders to send in troops.

Rep. Nancy Pelosi contrasted Trump's actions with his handling of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol when law enforcement officers were beaten. “We begged the president of the United States to send in the National Guard. He would not do it,” Pelosi said.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the use of National Guard troops following the first deployment, telling reporters that Trump had “trampled” the state's sovereignty. He sought an order declaring Trump's use of the Guard unlawful and asking for a restraining order to halt the deployment.

Trump said the city would have been “completely obliterated” if he had not deployed the Guard.

U.S. officials said the Marines were needed to protect federal buildings and personnel, including immigration agents. A convoy of buses with blacked-out windows and escorted by sheriff's vehicles arrived overnight at a Navy facility just south of LA.

Despite their presence, there has been limited engagement so far between the Guard and protesters while local law enforcement implements crowd control.

Thousands flooded the streets around City Hall for a union rally Monday before labor leader David Huerta was freed on a bond after he was arrested Friday while protesting the immigration raids.

As the crowd thinned, police began pushing protesters away, firing crowd-control munitions as people chanted, “Peaceful protest.” At least a dozen people were surrounded by police and detained.

Several dozen people were arrested throughout the weekend. Authorities say one was detained Sunday for throwing a Molotov cocktail at police and another for ramming a motorcycle into a line of officers.

The deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.

The last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

President Donald Trump said that those who hate the U.S. and attempt to protest the parade will face a 'heavy force' in response. 

President Donald Trump issued a word of caution for anyone who attempts to protest the military parade he is putting on to commemorate the U.S. Army's 250th birthday in Washington. 

""If there's any protest once they come out, they will be met with very big force,"" Trump told reporters Tuesday. ""I haven't even heard about a protest. But people that hate our country … they will be met with very heavy force.""

""It's going to be an amazing day,"" Trump said Tuesday. We have planes. We have all sorts of things. And I think it's going to be great. We're going to celebrate our country for a change.""

""The event is designed not only to showcase the Army's modern capabilities but also to inspire a new generation to embrace the spirit of service, resilience, and leadership that defines the United States,"" the America250 site says.

Trump's comments coincide with massive protests and riots in Los Angeles stemming from recent arrests in the city by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In response, Trump has deployed thousands of National Guard troops and 700 Marines to halt the riots and claimed that their presence will prevent the destruction of the city. 

However, Democrat California Gov. Gavin Newsom has criticized the Trump administration's use of troops, and claimed that the move undermines California's sovereignty.

Former deputy assistant Attorney General Tom Dupree dissects the case of the Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, who is accused of helping a migrant evade ICE agents on ‘The Story.'

Federal prosecutors are pushing back against Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan's motion to dismiss an indictment filed against her for allegedly helping an illegal immigrant evade Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in the Milwaukee County Courthouse last month.

Dugan, 65, was indicted last month on federal charges of obstruction of proceedings before a U.S. agency and unlawful concealment of an individual subject to arrest.

Her attorneys say she is entitled to judicial immunity and that the federal government overstepped its authority by arresting and charging her, violating her 10th Amendment rights and the principle of separation of powers, according to court documents filed in late May.

On Wednesday, prosecutors filed a response to her motion to dismiss, noting that ""the Supreme Court has made clear that judges are not immune from criminal liability.""

""In the end, Dugan asks for this Court to develop a novel doctrine of judicial immunity from criminal prosecution, and to apply it to the facts alleged in the indictment, all without reasonable basis—directly or indirectly—in the Constitution, statutes, or case law,"" prosecutors wrote. 

""In her lengthy memorandum, Dugan concedes that ‘[j]udges, like legislators and executive officials, are not above the law,'"" they said.

""Dugan's desired ruling would, in essence, say that judges are ‘above the law,' and uniquely entitled to interfere with federal law enforcement,"" prosecutors added.

Federal prosecutors allege that the Milwaukee Circuit Court judge personally escorted Mexican illegal immigrant and domestic battery suspect Eduardo Flores-Ruiz out of the courthouse on April 18 while ICE agents were attempting to serve a warrant.

The surveillance footage recently released by Milwaukee County in response to an open records request appears to show Dugan, wearing her black robe, confronting ICE agents in the courthouse hallway.

MILWAUKEE JUDGE HANNAH DUGAN TO ENTER PLEA IN FEDERAL COURT

Federal prosecutors say members of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), along with federal partners from the FBI, DEA, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, were preparing to serve Flores-Ruiz with a warrant in a public courthouse hallway on April 18 before his scheduled court appearance with Dugan.

WATCH THE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE:

After becoming aware of what federal officials described as a valid immigration arrest warrant for Flores-Ruiz, Dugan allegedly told agents that they needed a judicial warrant and told them to go to the chief judge's office.

The agents then left their place in the hallway, at which point Dugan allegedly chose not to hold a hearing for Flores-Ruiz and ""personally escorted"" the suspect and his attorney through a private exit while the victims of his alleged crimes were in the courthouse at the time, the Justice Department said in a press release.

While Dugan argues that ICE agents interrupted goings-on in the courthouse on April 18, prosecutors say it was Dugan who disrupted proceedings.

""The evidence also will show that agents were not in the courtroom when Dugan took the bench, but that—after being told by a member of her staff that ICE agents were present in the hallway—Dugan chose to pause an unrelated case, leave her courtroom, disrupt proceedings in a colleague's courtroom to commandeer her assistance, and then confront agents in the public hallway,"" the filing says. 

WISCONSIN JUDGE ACCUSED OF OBSTRUCTING ICE COULD FACE YEARS IN PRISON, DOJ HAS 'UPPER HAND': FORMER PROSECUTOR

Prosecutors say evidence also shows Dugan directing agents to the chief judge's office even while knowing he was out, then she ""quickly returned to her courtroom and, among other things, directed [Florez-Ruiz's] attorney to ‘take your client out and come back and get a date; and then to go through the jury door and down the stairs' before physically escorting [Flroes-Ruiz] and his attorney into a non-public hallway with access to a stairwell that led to a courthouse exit,"" filings say.

Dugan ""did this all just days after thanking a colleague for providing information which explained that ICE could lawfully make arrests in the courthouse hall,"" prosecutors stated Wednesday.

""Put simply, nothing in the indictment or the anticipated evidence at trial supports Dugan's assertion that agents ‘disrupted' the court's docket; instead, all events arose from Dugan's unilateral, non-judicial, and unofficial actions in obstructing a federal immigration matter over which she, as a Wisconsin state judge, had no authority,"" the document reads. ""At the very least, for purposes of deciding this motion, Dugan's claims to the contrary find no support in the indictment and should be rejected.""

One of Dugan's defense attorneys, Dean Strang, told Fox News Digital that her counsel has a ""good reply"" to prosecutors' Wednesday filing, but her team is waiting until their reply brief, due next Monday, to make it.

The Milwaukee judge has pleaded not guilty to charges filed against her, and a federal judge has set her trial date for July 21.

A federal indictment accuses Dugan of ""falsely"" telling federal officials in April that they needed a warrant to come into her courtroom during a scheduled appearance by Flores-Ruiz, an undocumented Mexican national facing three misdemeanor battery charges.

Video footage appears to show Flores-Ruiz exiting the courthouse with his attorney, while an ICE agent follows him, and then running alongside the building for about a block before agents capture and arrest him.

Federal officials arrested Dugan a week after the courthouse incident.

Dugan could face a maximum sentence of six years. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges filed against her. Fox News Digital has reached out to her attorney, Craig Mastantuono, for comment on the footage.

In April, Dugan's legal team also filed a motion to dismiss the federal case against her, saying the judge ""is entitled to judicial immunity for her official acts.""

""Immunity is not a defense to the prosecution to be determined later by a jury or court; it is an absolute bar to the prosecution at the outset,"" the motion said.

President Trump told reporters that Iran has given the administration its thoughts on a possible nuclear deal and is still seeking enrichment, which he said is not acceptable.

President Donald Trump told Fox News that Iran has become ""much more aggressive"" in nuclear talks. 

""Iran is acting much differently in negotiations than it did just days ago,"" Trump told Fox News' Bret Baier. ""Much more aggressive. It's surprising to me. It's disappointing, but we are set to meet again tomorrow – we'll see.""

Senior administration officials also told Fox News that Iran appears to be dragging negotiations on without concrete progress while pushing forward with its nuclear efforts.

This comes as Israel is growing more concerned it will have to act unilaterally to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.

TRUMP REJECTS IRAN'S COUNTER-PROPOSAL IN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: 'IT'S JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE'

Outgoing Commander of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), General Michael E. Kurilla, testified before the House Armed Services Committee earlier on Tuesday that he had ""provided a range of options"" to Trump to prevent Iran from going forward with their nuclear proliferation program, ""but I am in all favor of having a negotiated settlement that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon because of the consequences of conflict.""

Kurilla told lawmakers that Iran ""still remains the number one malign influence in the Middle East"" and has doubled its enrichment capacity in the past six months.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is traveling with Trump aboard Air Force One en route to Fort Bragg in North Carolina on Tuesday. 

Earlier Tuesday, Hegseth testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, answering questions from lawmakers on the Trump administration's proposed $1 trillion defense budget for the 2026 fiscal year. Hegseth, though he did not address Iran talks directly, said the budget commits more than $62 billion to ""modernize and sustain nuclear forces.""

Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, R-Tenn., did briefly bring up the looming Iranian nuclear threat while voicing concern that the U.S. is ""recapitalizing the entire nuclear deterrent all at once."" 

""Meanwhile, Russia has recaptured its triad minus some bombers, and China is rapidly expanding its numbers and fielding a triad. Of course, there's also North Korea and the looming prospect of a nuclear Iran,"" Fleischmann said. ""As we focus more on the Pacific, our post-Cold War posture is a concern due to the lack of in-theater, non-strategic nuclear weapons. This creates a deeply worrying capability gap in the most critical theater.""

Hegseth pushed back on the congressman's assertion, while underscoring the necessity of updating three components of the nuclear triad – land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and strategic bombers – to perpetuate a credible deterrent against foreign adversaries.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the National Guard and Marine deployments in Los Angeles to quell rioters in a heated exchange with Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., on Tuesday during a House Appropriations Subcommittee hearing.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday forcefully defended the deployment of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles, accusing California Gov. Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass of failing to protect ICE agents and citizens from violent rioters — and asserting that Trump is stepping in to do the job.

Hegseth sparred with Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., during a heated House Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on Tuesday, asserting that the president had the legal authority to deploy the troops since rioters had attacked ICE agents and torched property in parts of the sanctuary city – while waving Mexican flags and flags of other nations.

""The governor of California is unable to execute the laws of the United States,"" Hegseth said. ""The governor of California has failed to protect his people, along with the mayor of Los Angeles and so President Trump has said he will protect our agents and our Guard and Marines are proud to do it.""

TRUMP TAKES ACTION AGAINST 'ORCHESTRATED ATTACK' ON LAW ENFORCEMENT BY DEPLOYING MARINES TO LA: ASSEMBLYMAN

Hegseth justified the decision for the Trump administration to intervene, saying that every American citizen deserves to live in a community that is safe, and that ICE agents need to be able to do their job. The riots broke out on Friday as ICE agents were taking part in deportation raids in the city, fulfilling a key part of Trump's immigration enforcement agenda.

""They're being attacked for doing their job, which is deporting illegal criminals that should happen in any city, Minneapolis or Los Angeles,"" Hegseth said. ""And if they're attacked, that's lawless and President Trump believes in law and order, so he has every authority.""

Aguilar questioned whether Trump had the authority to deploy National Guard troops under 10 U.S. Code 12406, citing three examples of when it can be used while also blasting the administration for not consulting with the state before doing so. Trump has deployed 2,000 National Guardsmen and around 700 U.S. Marines.

""Invasion by a foreign nation, rebellion or dangerous rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States, or the president is unable with regular forces to execute the laws of the United States,"" Aguilar said. ""Which authority is triggered here to justify the use?"" 

But Hegseth fired back and said, ""it sounds like all three to me.""

""If you've got millions of illegals, you don't know where they're coming from. They're waving flags from foreign countries and assaulting police officers and law enforcement officers. You and I both know that President Trump has all the authority necessary, and thankfully, he's willing to do it on behalf of the citizens of Los Angeles, on behalf of our ICE agents and behalf of our country.""

Aguilar also raised concern that the troops were ill-prepared, since pictures were posted of them sleeping on floors in uniform. 

""That's a disingenuous attack that misrepresents how much we care about our troops… Nobody cares more about the troops at the top than this secretary and the chairman in our department,"" Hegseth said. ""The commanders and troops on the field are very well prepared... There are moments where you make do as best you can temporarily, but we are ensuring they're housed, fed, [and have] water capabilities in real time from my office.""

Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense Bryn MacDonnell testified that the cost of the deployment is expected to be $134 million, with funds being pulled from regular operational accounts.

Elsewhere, Hegseth said the department would need $961.6 billion in the fiscal year 2026 budget, which would be used to rebuild military strength, countering China, border security and funding the new Golden Dome missile defense system. A 10.5% pay raise was also secured for junior enlisted troops.

Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports from Capitol Hill as anti-ICE riots rock Los Angeles.

FIRST ON FOX: Some House Republicans are now considering whether non-citizens who are found to have participated in violent anti-law enforcement riots have a right to stay in the United States.

Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, is leading a bill that would make non-U.S. citizens convicted of ""actual or attempted assault, battery, or use of force"" against any law enforcement officer eligible for deportation.

Any immigrants deported under the legislation, if enacted, would be permanently barred from the United States.

""The thing about breaking the law is, there's effectively a waiving of your constitutional rights that's sort of inherent in our system, right? When you go to prison, you're losing your liberty,"" Crenshaw told Fox News Digital in an interview Tuesday.

""So this is a very normal thing, and in the case of say, people who are here legally, but then committing acts of violence – in this case, we're being really specific, during a national emergency, committing assaults against police officers, and destruction of property – that should have an effect and be on the list of things that allows for revocation of your status.""

Early bill text obtained by Fox News Digital shows the bill would apply to legal permanent residents, people here illegally, and beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. It would go into effect when presidents, governors or local leaders make emergency or major disaster declarations.

It comes amid continued tensions in Los Angeles, where protests against Immigrations and Customs Enforcement operations turned violent across the city this weekend.

Rioters were seen burning American flags and cars stood on the street in flames, while police used pepper spray and rubber bullets on crowds outside federal buildings.

President Donald Trump deployed the National Guard despite the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom and ordered 700 U.S. Marines to Los Angeles as well. Those Marines will be training in Seal Beach for a few more days before deployment, a U.S. defense official told Fox News. 

Democrats have accused the Trump administration of escalating violence in Los Angeles, while Republicans argue that federal action is necessary based on the state's handling of the situation.

Crenshaw said his legislation would help the administration restore order during such times.

""What it would do is, it would give the administration the option to say, yeah we've rounded all these people up, half of them are U.S. citizens, okay, you're going to jail for rioting. Maybe another quarter are illegals, well that's easy you can deport them,"" he said.

""But what about the other quarter? You know, that might be…a number of legal aliens here rioting against America for enforcing our immigration laws. In our minds, you've violated that sort of social contract with the United States at that point.""

Crenshaw said he spoke with the White House and that officials there were ""excited"" about the bill.

The White House said it would not get in front of the president on legislative matters when reached for comment by Fox News Digital.

Currently, legal U.S. residents, including green card holders, can have their status revoked by an immigration judge if they are found guilty of certain crimes or are found to have fraudulently misrepresented themselves in their application for residence.

Crimes that would make legal U.S. visa holders and green card holders eligible for deportation currently include murder, drug trafficking and rape.

But I'm experiencing Catholic guilt.

Dear James,

In the second half of last year, I went to a naturist beach for the first time. I was afraid on my whole walk there that I would chicken out. But there was nobody around for miles—so I stripped. Since then, I've done it five more times, at various beaches, with growing confidence, in front of other people who have and have not been clothed. I've found great peace in lying naked on the sand, listening to the waves.

But: Over the winter I started to get these feelings of shame and guilt. I was raised a very strict Catholic. And although my mother has been dead for a decade, I can suddenly feel her strong disapproval from beyond the grave.

It's a conundrum. How would you handle it?

Dear Reader,

Well, I was in church on Sunday morning for the Feast of Pentecost, celebrating the wacky mandate of the Holy Spirit to go where it pleases—to land, if it likes, right on top of somebody's head (your head, my head, anybody's head) and nest there in a throbbing bolus of flame. So yup, I'm ready to get Catholic about this. I'm ready to get dogmatic.

Your body is a gift from God. In the appropriate place (such as a naturist beach), you should be able to go as naked as Adam in the garden and feel not a twinge-let of shame. You should be like the primal newborns in the Doors' “Waiting for the Sun”: “At first flash of Eden / We raced down to the sea / Standing there on freedom's shore.” (Who dares to say Jim Morrison isn't a great American poet?) Isn't that the true spirit of nudism? They don't call it a birthday suit for nothing. Shed your clothes; shed everything that cramps or abashes you. Air out those musty parts. Unshadow yourself. Let it all flap. Be a real American. Scamper shoeless across the sand into liberty's gold-green sunrise.

Me, I'm not great at being naked. It makes me feel too … naked. So I know where you're coming from. But you've done so well, made such strides in self-development. The confidence, the peace, the waves: Keep going! Of course—as at any breakthrough moment, any evolutionary threshold of the psyche—you're being swarmed by the old demons, now at extra strength: guilt, disgrace, an image of your mother scolding you. They are to be stoutly resisted. Imagine instead your mother's delight in you as a baby, in all your sweet-smelling, roly-poly nudeness. Imagine reality taking pleasure in itself across the surface of your skin. Last word here goes to Gerard Manley Hopkins, great Catholic sensualist, nudist in his heart: “The Holy Ghost over the bent / World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.”

Safe in my trousers,

James

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The Trap of the Cinematic Side Quest","https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/06/ballerina-john-wick-spin-off-review/683099/","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 18:58:49 GMT","

The new John Wick spin-off shows that expanding a franchise is harder than it may sound.

What makes the John Wick movies work isn't the premise—that John Wick, the character, is a man out for vengeance. Yes, that was the breathless elevator pitch of the first Wick installment, a cult hit in 2014 whose plot my colleague Sophie Gilbert effortlessly summed up as: “An idiot killed his puppy and now everyone must die.” But Wick (played by Keanu Reeves) became the face of a billion-dollar franchise because of the strange, darkly cartoonish universe around him. Ballerina, a spin-off whose lumbering subtitle proclaims it as coming “From the World of John Wick,” recognizes that true appeal only when it's half over.

The story of Ballerina is generic to the point of hilarity; the original script was, in fact, a female-led action thriller unrelated to the Wick-iverse. As such, the film begins with the same setup as a hundred other revenge thrillers: A young girl, Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas), sees her father gunned down by a group of mysterious assassins. Spirited away by friendly faces from the primary John Wick entries, she swears vengeance, and is trained to be a killer in the mold of, well, John Wick. Her mentor is the Director (Anjelica Huston), the matriarch of the Ruska Roma, an organization introduced in John Wick: Chapter 3 that teaches its students how to punch, kick, shoot a gun, and take a fall among the best of them.

For much of Ballerina's two-hour run time, I bemoaned that the film seemed to be a Wick clone without any of the stylistic flair. It wasn't a total wash: De Armas is a charming screen presence, throwing herself at fight scenes with aplomb. She moves with a lot more grace than Reeves, who appears to be slowing down after a quadrilogy in which seemingly everyone across the globe is on his tail. But unlike the mysterious, mythic Wicks, Ballerina lacks much intrigue—especially during its first two acts, when the viewer watches Eve go through training and then embark on a few jobs around town, mowing through goons in dimly lit nightclubs for no purpose to the plot.

Read: John Wick and the tragedy of the aimless assassin

The sense of aimlessness is an issue with so many spin-offs. Think Hobbs & Shaw (which derives from the Fast & Furious movies), Bumblebee (set in the Transformers universe), or the several attempts to generate new Star Wars adventures outside of the main saga: They have to exist on a scale equivalent to their progenitors to not feel totally irrelevant, but avoid disturbing the franchise's primary timeline. Although Ballerina ostensibly occurs between the third and fourth John Wick chapters, it strives to affect neither one; the chronological placement is only to justify how Reeves (who doesn't do much in his several brief scenes) manages to show up—though having watched the other Wick movies, I do not remember his character ever having enough downtime to take on a little side quest with Eve.

Ballerina ultimately succeeds as a piece of junky fun, however, because it attempts to expand the Wick canon rather than deepen its titular protagonist. Take what follows after Eve becomes emboldened to hop off the regular mission treadmill and seek payback against the strange cult that killed her father: Her journey leads her into a quaint village in the Austrian Alps, where she learns that every single inhabitant is out to kill her. Considering stopping by the curiosity shop for some Hummel figurines? Just don't turn your back to any friendly clerks.

This scenario is a prime example of John Wick's signature world building. As the first Wick movie progressed, the bizarre depths in which the character lived became apparent. Everyone around our hero was connected to criminality, and any ordinary subway rider or unhoused person on a street corner might be concealing a semiautomatic to attack him with. John Wick's version of reality has its own currency (golden coins) and housing system (an intercontinental chain of hotels), as well as a set of laws that mix Samurai-like honor with feudal justice. At first, Ballerina pays little mind to any of that, but once Eve enters this cultish mountain town, the askew storytelling begins again. Finally, I was reminded of why I'd stayed interested in the Wick chronicles for all these years.

Read: Spin-Off City: Why Hollywood is built on unoriginal ideas

Yes, that includes the action filmmaking, and Ballerina features some incredibly inventive stunts of its own. One extended sequence sees Eve dueling an enemy while each wields flamethrowers; in another, she has to dispatch oncoming aggressors using belts of grenades without blowing herself up. The grim violence has a sense of humor and improvisation to it; de Armas doesn't exactly get the chance to crack jokes, but it harkens back to the Buster Keaton– and Looney Tunes–inspired mayhem at the core of John Wick. Whereas an offshoot like Hobbs & Shaw didn't understand what made its source series good (by largely ignoring the earlier films' wild internal logic), Ballerina eventually comes to terms with it—and then locks on.

But despite its best efforts to appeal to the John Wick fan base, Ballerina opened below expectations during its first weekend. The box-office earnings are a possible indication of waning interest in the world of John Wick, which may be taken into account as Reeves weighs returning for another mainline entry. After all, a film like Ballerina ostensibly exists only to keep the franchise's devotees sated in the meantime. Perhaps this kind of business-minded cynicism is unhelpful, but it's unavoidable, as Hollywood flounders for ways to sustain people's interest in going to the cinema. If studios are going to spin off their biggest titles to keep those properties alive, they might as well do it as faithfully as possible.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

﻿This is what it's like to witness ICE raids and protests unfold in the city I was born and raised in.

My mom has been a housekeeper for as long as I can remember. As a child, I'd accompany her on the bus to the houses she cleaned, impressed with how it seemed like she knew just about everyone en route to their own jobs. There was always friendly acknowledgment and solidarity — especially with those in restaurant uniforms or carrying their own cleaning supplies. 

Some of the people she befriended became trusted confidants she'd recruit to help with strenuous cleaning gigs and eventually help land custodial jobs with the city of Los Angeles. Many years later, these individuals would pool together money to ensure I didn't fly across the country to an internship in New York City empty-handed, even though they didn't have much to give. Getting a front-row seat to the community my mom built with others who worked low-wage jobs with long hours — for a shot at not just a better life for their families but for survival — was one of the most special acts of camaraderie I've had the privilege to witness. 

My mom never complained. Neither did her friends. Their resilience, both mental and physical, taught me to acknowledge people who so often get overlooked. I thought of them as I said hello to the custodians who worked early mornings and late nights at the University of Southern California while I attended school there. I thought of them as I translated the news for social media posts in my previous job at the Los Angeles Times, understanding that language barriers can make receiving quality information much harder. And I thought of them and others who had taken similar journeys to LA as US Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducts aggressive immigration raids throughout the city. 

In the last few weeks, ICE has intensified its operations throughout the US. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller urged immigration enforcement to make at least 3,000 arrests a day. The Trump administration has frequently targeted “sanctuary jurisdictions” with large immigrant populations like Los Angeles, arguing they are getting in the way of its campaign promise to deport millions of people.

Thousands of demonstrators protested ICE and its raids over the weekend, leading to clashes with the police, and President Donald Trump deploying the National Guard to LA. As of Tuesday, the administration has also sent in around 700 Marines. Images of Los Angeles Police Department officers in riot gear, demonstrators blocking the 101 freeway, infographics with resources for undocumented immigrants, and arrests flooded my social media feeds. A video of a man being detained by ICE outside of his workplace went viral. His daughter, who filmed the post, cries in the background, telling him how much she loves him while reminding him of his rights. As she tries to plead with him, he remains calm. His bravery reminded me of my mom, whose quiet demeanor eclipses the sacrifices she's made to give her five children a better life. 

In the wake of the protests, Trump posted on Truth Social, “A once great American City, Los Angeles, has been invaded and occupied by Illegal Aliens and Criminals. Now violent, insurrectionist mobs are swarming and attacking our Federal Agents to try and stop our deportation operations — But these lawless riots only strengthen our resolve...”

The LA I know, the city I grew up in and care deeply about, hasn't been “invaded” and isn't a “lawless” place that requires federal force. While so much media focuses on protests, further legitimizing Trump's war zone narrative, an important story is being overlooked: immigrants, like many detained outside of their workplaces, and like my mom, have quietly built this city.

More immigrants live in California than in any other state. Undocumented Californians paid $96.7 billion in taxes in 2022, all while being generally unable to access services their taxes help fund, like Medicaid and housing assistance. Over one in three Angelenos are immigrants, and while estimates vary, there could be about 1 million undocumented LA residents. 

And there is no LA without Latinos. The city was originally a part of Mexico, and Latino influence remains a cornerstone of its identity. Its namesake, neighborhoods, and street names (Los Feliz, San Pedro, La Cienega, La Brea, and more) reflect its Spanish-speaking origins. Olvera Street, the colorful marketplace, and Union Station, a transit hub that combines modern and Latin architectural styles, are only two examples of culturally significant landmarks. Latinos comprise almost half of the Los Angeles Dodgers' fan base and have endearingly called the team “Los Doyers” for decades. The late baseball star Fernando Valenzuela was a pitching pioneer in Major League Baseball. The city, known as a major culinary destination, boasts all kinds of regional Mexican and Central American cuisines. You can find Oaxacan tlayudas, Sinaloan aguachiles, Salvadoran pupusas, and Guatemalan tamales all within a 30-minute radius. 

In that same Truth Social post, Trump wrote that Los Angeles would be set free. But how could it be liberated from the same generations of people who continue to help define it? 

These workers, whose invisible labor supports the state's infrastructure, are not a monolith. They fill vital roles as students, teachers, business owners, housekeepers, landscapers, caretakers, staff, and more. They are often assumed to be recent arrivals, but more than two-thirds of undocumented residents have been in the US for more than a decade. About 14 percent of California's population either lacks legal status or lives with undocumented family members. According to the Public Policy Institute, the majority of Californians want pathways for noncitizens to obtain legal status. Yet despite the combination of public support and some statewide programs offering public benefits to undocumented immigrants, the pathway to legal citizenship remains complicated and unattainable for many. Meanwhile, ICE continues to carry out Trump's mass deportation plans in Southern California. 

Contrary to what some headlines might suggest, the backlash on LA's streets and displays of support online are unsurprising. There's a long history of social justice activism here: demands for educational equity in the East Los Angeles walkouts in 1968, solidarity with farmworker strikes demanding better labor conditions in the '70s, the 1992 Rodney King uprising against police brutality, and protests in 2020 following George Floyd's murder. What's being demonstrated now is a city united with people who aren't invaders or occupants, but who are LA. 

There are too many stereotypes about Los Angeles to count. One commonly heard narrative, likely from the influx of transplants coming to take advantage of the entertainment industry, presumes that so many people are driven by their own personal gains, and are too unwilling to venture outside of their affluent neighborhoods to care about others on a macro level. This couldn't be further from the truth.

Earlier this year, California experienced the Eaton and Palisades fires. In the aftermath of the tragedy, Angelenos banded together to support their communities. Volunteers assembled food packages and sorted through donations. Several local restaurants offered free food to victims and first responders. Countless grassroots efforts directly supported displaced individuals. 

This sense of empathy isn't limited to large-scale catastrophes. I live in the South Bay, where people are eager to support their villages. They contribute to GoFundMes to help alleviate hospital bills and funeral expenses. They support small businesses, volunteer their time at fundraisers, participate in meal trains, and share helpful events and resources on their social media profiles.

There's a painful disconnect between sensationalized storytelling and the Los Angeles I've known and lived in for my entire life. As I scroll through videos of vandalism outside city hall, officers teargassing protesters, and children terrified about where their parents are headed to, I can't help but feel both immense grief and anger. It's easy for cameras to capture chaos and unrest, rather than the circumstances that led people to leave their country of origin. It's easy for trolls online to suggest that people should have come here legally, without acknowledging the intricate process and undocumented immigrants' predisposition to exploitation. 

Stories about immigrants are not always afforded nuance. Their humanity is stripped as they are categorized into political talking points or condensed into data figures. The actions they've taken to change the trajectory of their families' lives are what many others would do in their position, but are judged differently because of the framing. The lives they actually live — the callouses they've developed on their hands after years of labor many couldn't imagine undertaking, the people they make laugh, the motivations that drive them, their homesickness for places that don't exist anymore — are often ignored. It hurts because I am familiar with the people behind the headlines. They raised me.

As news coverage and political figures paint my hometown as a disorderly battleground overrun with “illegals,” I wish they could understand the LA I know and am proud to live in. It's where people acknowledge those who quietly live up to the American ethos of pulling themselves up by their bootstraps despite not living in a meritocracy, with little recognition and not even so much as a “hello” in passing. It's where camaraderie runs deep, whether people are contributing to mutual aid funds or ensuring their friend's daughter gets to pursue her dreams in a state they might never visit. Los Angeles's foundation is made up of people like my mom, who understand hardship, but continue to choose generosity instead.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Uber is teaming up with a Microsoft-backed startup to launch robotaxis on the chaotic roads of London","https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-teams-up-with-wayve-to-launch-robotaxis-in-london-2025-6","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 08:31:00 GMT","

London's famous black cabs could be about to get some robotaxi competition.

Uber and Wayve, a British AI startup backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, announced on Tuesday that they will trial fully driverless autonomous vehicles in London, as the ride-hailing giant steps up its robotaxi ambitions.

The driverless ride-hailing service in the UK capital will see Uber deploy vehicles running Wayve's AI-powered self-driving tech in a pilot program.

""If you prove this technology works here, you can literally drive anywhere. It's one of the hardest proving grounds,"" Wayve CEO Alex Kendall told Business Insider during a test drive ahead of the launch.

The news comes after the UK government announced it would fast-track approval for pilots of self-driving taxis from 2027 to spring 2026.

Wayve and Uber declined to say when the initial deployment will begin, or which global carmaker would provide the vehicles for the robotaxi service.

After largely abandoning plans to build its own self-driving cars, Uber has shifted strategy and struck a spree of deals to add robotaxis operated by self-driving companies to its app.

The company has a partnership with Google-backed Waymo to operate its autonomous taxis on the Uber platform in Austin and Phoenix, and has signed similar deals with Chinese robotaxi startups WeRide and Pony.AI.

Uber inked its deal with Wayve last year, agreeing to deploy self-driving vehicles powered by the British startup's technology on its platform in multiple markets around the world.

Uber also invested in Wayve through an extension of the company's Series C fundraising round, which raised $1.05 billion from investors including Softbank, Nvidia, and Microsoft.

The London-based startup, which has been testing its fleet of autonomous Ford Mach-Es with a safety driver in London for several years, has quickly become one of the buzziest names in the robotaxi industry.

Wayve says its ""AI driver"" runs on an end-to-end AI model — an approach also adopted by Tesla — allowing it to react to the physical world in the same way a human would and drive anywhere, unlike rivals like Waymo, which rely on high-definition maps to operate their robotaxis.

Speaking to Business Insider from the back of a Wayve self-driving car in central London, Wayve CEO Kendall said the company had tested its autonomous vehicles in 90 cities over the past 90 days.

""It's a real demonstration of how well this technology generalizes. The diversity we saw on these roads is immense, from winding roads in the Swiss Alps and dirt tracks in Italy to diverse cities like Vancouver and Tokyo,"" said Kendall.

He said the vehicles in the robotaxi service in London will initially use a mixed suite of sensors, including cameras, radar, and lidar (laser-based sensors), adding that the chaotic nature of London's roads made it the perfect place to trial Wayve's technology without a safety driver. During BI's test ride, Wayve's AI driver navigated a number of obstacles, such as roadworks in London's busy Kings Cross district.

""The ambition is to be driving in every city Uber operates in with our robotaxis. And I think only through end-to-end machine learning can you reach that level of scale,"" he added.

Last Friday's jobs report was upbeat, but the numbers might not be telling the whole story, one economist warns.

Samuel Tombs, Chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, sees a labor market struggling with softening hiring and an accelerating trend of downward revisions.

In May, 139,000 jobs were added, beating the 125,000 consensus estimate, but that was overshadowed somewhat by sharp revisions to prior months' data. March's initial figure of 224,000 payrolls added has since been nearly slashed in half, down to 120,000.

It's likely that May's figure is inflated, too, Tombs said.

""We expect May's number to be revised down to about 100,000 by the third estimate, published in early August,"" Tombs wrote in a recent note.

Since January 2023, downward revisions between the intial and third estimates for each month have averaged 30,000.

The frequency of downward revisions could be due to reporting by small businesses filing payroll data late, Tombs said. Smaller companies are often hit the hardest by high interest rates and tariff costs.

""Small businesses are really the canary in the coal mine in this downturn,"" Tombs told BI. ""They don't have the financial capacity to deal with many of the upfront costs that are involved with tariffs. They still face very high borrowing costs, so they are very, very cautious with both their hiring and capex decisions going forward.""

Tombs sees continued weakness in the retail, wholesale, and transport and logistics sectors, and expects employment in those parts of the economy to fall by 50,000 by year-end due to a reduction in the ""pull-forward effect"" from tariffs, which saw many businesses and consumers rush to spend money ahead of tariff-related price hikes.

On top of the revisions, hiring also appeared poised to slow. The NFIB small business hiring intentions index slipped to its lowest level since May 2020, and regional Fed surveys suggest continued declines in service-sector employment outside healthcare and education.

""Of all the indicators that we track, it is the best singular indicator of payroll growth that we've found in the last three years,"" Tombs said of the NFIB survey.

In the chart below, hiring intentions tracked by regional Fed surveys are weaker than the 2015 to 2024 average. Actual job growth in the private services sector tends to move closely with hiring intentions, meaning that when hiring intentions fall, actual hiring tends to drop shortly after.

Tombs believes government jobs will also continue to decline after their DOGE gutting as federal employees who accepted a voluntary buyout get removed from the payroll in September — they've fallen by 59,000 this year, including by 22,000 in May.

On this trajectory, Tombs expects the unemployment rate to peak at 4.8% by December.

This year, the Fed has been in wait-and-see mode when it comes to cutting rates, and some strategists believe it's prioritizing bringing inflation down before turning to expansionary monetary policy. But these factors point to a labor market that's weaker than it seems, and Tombs believes the Fed will need to start cutting rates in September to provide relief for businesses, before inflation peaks.

A growing chorus of advisers inside and outside the Trump administration are pushing another name to serve as the next chair of the Federal Reserve: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

President Donald Trump said Friday he would name a successor “very soon” to replace Jerome Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May 2026. The small list of candidates under consideration has included Kevin Warsh, a former Fed official whom Trump interviewed for the Treasury secretary role in November, according to people familiar with the matter.

The undocumented Mexican immigrant who was detained after being framed by a jailed inmate for threatening President Donald Trump can be released on a $7,500 bond, a Chicago Immigration Court judge ruled Tuesday morning.

Judge Carla Espinoza said at a hearing that she does not believe Milwaukee resident Ramon Morales-Reyes is a danger to the community pending removal proceedings.

The judge noted that although the 54-year-old Morales-Reyes has been arrested several times since 1996, he has only been convicted once, for disorderly conduct.

An attorney representing the Department of Homeland Security did not oppose a request by the immigrant's lawyer, Cain Oulahan, requesting bond. Oulahan and Morales-Reyes appeared remotely, with the immigrant still detained in Dodge County Jail in Wisconsin.

Espinoza said that if Morales-Reyes is unable to post bond, the next hearing in the case will be on July 10, and that she would set another date if the married dad of three is released.

CNBC has requested comment from Oulahan.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in a statement, said, ""While this criminal illegal alien is no longer under investigation for threats against the President, he is in the country illegally with previous arrests for felony hit and run, criminal damage to property, and disorderly conduct with domestic abuse.""

""The Trump administration is committed to restoring the rule of law and fulfilling the President's mandate to deport illegal aliens. DHS will continue to fight for the arrest, detention, and removal of illegal aliens who have no right to be in this country,"" McLaughlin said. 

Morales-Reyes, who has lived in the United States since 1986, was arrested May 22 on suspicion that he had written three letters to law enforcement officers in Wisconsin that threatened Trump and others.

A week later, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem touted Morales-Reyes' arrest in a news release that called the dishwasher an ""illegal alien,"" and featured his photo, as well as an image of a handwritten letter threatening to shoot ""your precious president"" Trump.

But Milwaukee police who questioned Morales-Reyes quickly realized there was a problem with the allegations against him, court records show.

First, a handwriting sample Morales-Reyes provided was ""completely different"" from the writing on the letters and the envelopes, which bore his home address as the return address, a criminal complaint says. Also, Morales-Reyes does not speak, read, or write English fluently, while the writing in the letters was in English.

When a police detective asked Morales-Reyes, ""Who would want to get [him] in trouble, [he] stated that the only person who would want to get him in [trouble] was the person who had robbed him and who law enforcement knows to be the defendant, Demetric D. Scott.""

Scott, who is detained in Milwaukee County Jail, was arrested in late 2023 for allegedly robbing Morales-Reyes and attacking him with a box cutter.

Scott, 52, told police in late May that he had written the threatening letters about Trump, and put Morales-Reyes' address on the envelopes before they were sent on his behalf by others, to get the immigrant arrested by federal authorities so that he would be unable to testify at Scott's criminal trial in July, court records state.

Scott hoped that his case would be dismissed when Morales-Reyes failed to appear in court, those records say.

Scott has been charged with identity theft, felony intimidation of a witness, and bail jumping in connection with the letters plot.

At the time Morales-Reyes was arrested, he had applied for a special type of visa available to victims of certain crimes.

The web page announcing the Morales-Reyes' arrest remains up on DHS's site, with the now discredited allegations against him.

At the bottom of that page is a ""disclaimer,"" which notes that he is no longer under investigation for threatening Trump.

In this article

Starbucks plans to roll out a generative artificial intelligence assistant created with Microsoft Azure's OpenAI platform to 35 locations this month as part of its strategy to simplify baristas' jobs and speed up service in its cafes.

The coffee chain showed off the new technology to more than 14,000 North American store managers at its Leadership Experience in Las Vegas on Tuesday. A broad launch of the ""Green Dot Assist"" platform across the U.S. and Canada is slated for the company's fiscal 2026, which starts in the fall.

The three-day event comes as Starbucks pushes to revive its sluggish U.S. sales and ""get back to Starbucks,"" as CEO Brian Niccol has described the effort since he took the role last year. Niccol's priorities include slashing service times to four minutes per order. Quick, accurate answers to barista questions could help achieve that goal.

""It's just another example of how innovation technology is coming into service of our partners and making sure that we're doing all we can to simplify the operations, make their jobs just a little bit easier, maybe a little bit more fun, so that they can do what they do best,"" Starbucks Chief Technology Officer Deb Hall Lefevre told CNBC.

Instead of flipping through manuals or accessing Starbucks' intranet, baristas will be able to use a tablet behind the counter equipped with Green Dot Assist to get answers to a range of questions, from how to make an iced shaken espresso to troubleshooting equipment errors. Baristas can either type or verbally ask their queries in conversational language.

As the AI assistant evolves, Starbucks has even bigger plans for its next generation. Those ideas include automatically creating a ticket with IT for equipment issues or generating suggestions for a substitute when a barista calls out of work, according to Lefevre.

Starbucks is expanding its relationship with Microsoft about a year after the tech giant's CEO Satya Nadella stepped down from Starbucks' board of directors.

Since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022, companies have been trying to implement generative AI in their own operations, envisioning the AI hype can cut expenses and maybe even boost their stock prices. Walmart and JPMorgan Chase are among the corporate giants that have rolled out AI assistants for their workforce.

But chatbots aren't always a perfect solution. They can sometimes provide inaccurate answers, known as ""hallucinations,"" which could mean another headache instead of an easy resolution. Lefevre said the company's partnership with Microsoft includes a grounding engine that ensures the accuracy of the information provided.

Other restaurant companies have also been looking to AI to simplify their restaurant workers' jobs and improve operations. For example, Yum Brands has partnered with Nvidia to roll out AI order-taking, Nvidia-powered computer vision and restaurant performance assessments fueled by AI. But AI agreements haven't always been successful. McDonald's ended its partnership with IBM after its test of AI drive-thru order-taking didn't meet expectations.

Other new technology on display at the Leadership Experience includes the latest generation of Starbucks' Mastrena espresso machines and a more intuitive point-of-sale system.

Lefevre said tenured baristas have been learning to use the new POS in as little as an hour. Plus, the technology can offer personalized recommendations and loyal customers' repeat orders, helping Starbucks achieve the personalized touch it's looking to bring back to its cafes.

ChatGPT was down for some users on Tuesday, with nearly 2,000 outage reports on Downdetector, a site that logs user reports of internet issues.

OpenAI said performance was recovering at 12:23 p.m. EDT, but the status page still displayed a ""degraded performance"" alert.

The artificial intelligence chatbot gave some users a ""Too many concurrent requests"" message, or would not answer questions.

The OpenAI status page earlier showed ""elevated error rates"" ongoing for seven hours.

OpenAI announced Monday that it reached $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, or ARR. Last year, the company had around $5.5 billion in ARR but reported a loss of about $5 billion.

ChatGPT rolled out an update to Advanced Voice for paid users on Saturday. The feature improves ""intonation and naturalness, making interactions feel more fluid and human-like,"" according to the release notes.

 Trump's tax cuts and soaring US debt fuel Bitcoin's rise as a hedge against sovereign default risks, potentially pushing BTC price toward $200,000 or more by 2025. 

Key takeaways:

Bitwise predicts Bitcoin could hit $200,000 by year-end, with a potential “fair value” of $230,000.

Trump's proposed tax cuts and rising US debt position Bitcoin as a hedge against sovereign default risks.

Bitcoin's OTT signal suggests strong momentum after a dip to $100,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) could surpass $200,000 by the end of the year and eventually reach its estimated “fair value” of $230,000, according to Bitwise researchers André Dragosch and Ayush Tripathi.

In their weekly crypto outlook, Dragosch and Tripathi cite the US's soaring federal debt and mandatory spending exceeding revenues, exacerbated by Trump's proposed “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” tax cuts, as key drivers of their bullish Bitcoin prediction.

The Congressional Budget Office forecasts net interest payments tripling to $3 trillion by 2030, raising default fears.

“Bitcoin's scarcity and resilience position it uniquely to benefit from both fiscal instability and improving market sentiment,” Bitwise analysts said. If these trends hold, the top crypto could shatter price expectations by year-end.

Related: Bank of Japan pivot to QE may fuel Bitcoin rally — Arthur Hayes

An example of such “sovereign stress” is Bitcoin's performance in the wake of the Donald Trump-Elon Musk feud last week, driven by the latter's criticism of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

BTC's price declined 6% to almost $100,000 amid the spat, only to recover sharply over the weekend.

“Despite a short-lived dip to $100K during the Musk-Trump spat, BTC quickly rebounded on short liquidations,” wrote Bitwise, adding: 

Adding to Bitwise's outlook, a May 28 analysis by Stockmoney Lizards highlights a bullish Bitcoin breakout indicator. 

The signal comes from the Optimized Trend Tracker (OTT), which triggered for the first time since mid-2024, suggesting Bitcoin will potentially reach $200,000 in 2025, with a possible extension to $250,000.

Last month, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan told Cointelegraph that the BTC price will hit $200,000 by the end of 2025, driven by a supply shock from surging institutional demand.

A “power law” model that has accurately called Bitcoin tops and bottoms in the past cycles further hints at BTC price hitting $200,000 by year's end.

The future of money has arrived, with 60% of Fortune 500 companies actively working on blockchain initiatives, digital asset exchange Coinbase (COIN) said in its second quarter State of Crypto report published Tuesday.

Stablecoin usage is exploding with a 54% growth in supply year-on-year, more than one third of small and medium sized businesses (SMB) are using crypto, and 60% of Fortune 500 companies are working on blockchain projects, the report said.

Adoption is expected to continue to grow. Twenty percent of Fortune 500 executives said that onchain initiatives were a key part of their company's strategy moving forward, and more than 80% of institutional investors plan to increase their exposure to crypto this year.

Forty-six percent of small and medium businesses who don't use crypto are planning to start using it in the next three years, the report said, and 82% of these companies were of the view that usage of this technology could help address some of their ""financial pain points.""

Still, for crypto to reach its full potential, greater regulatory clarity is needed. 90% of F500 execs surveyed said that clear crypto regulation in the U.S. is needed to support innovation.

Coinbase used third-party research firms to survey 100 Fortune 500 executives about their adoption of Web3, and 251 decision-makers at small and medium-sized businesses in April. It also analysed web3 initiative activity by Fortune 100 companies between 2020 and 2025.

What is this lawsuit about?

On November 8, 2023, Midnight Hub went silent after co-founder Brian Veluz-Nepomuceno was arrested for fraud. The company had sold ROOMS and Digital Nomads NFTs with promises of staking, exclusive features, and future profit-sharing. None of these were delivered, and the NFTs lost nearly all their value.

Privacy concerns are becoming a top priority in crypto. As public blockchain data grows more visible and tracking tools get more advanced, many users now recognize the risks of using traditional wallets without safeguards.

Cold Wallet introduces a cryptocurrency ICO that sets new standards. By merging zero-knowledge technology with the principles of cold storage, it delivers a secure wallet experience that remains active without revealing sensitive user data.

Now priced at $0.0087 during its presale stage 12 and aiming for a listing at $0.3517, Cold Wallet is gaining real momentum. Experts suggest its core focus on privacy could make 4,900% gains a realistic outcome post-launch.

Many users believe managing their own keys ensures total privacy. Yet, several hot wallets still expose user data through IP tracking, linkages to on-chain behavior, and third-party analytics.

Cold Wallet introduces a robust response: a wallet that operates as if offline while connected. Powered by zero-knowledge technology, it keeps balances hidden, disguises transactions, and avoids the data leaks common in other tools. Rather than compromising usability for security, it provides both simplicity and enterprise-level defense.

That technical strength makes it stand apart from most cryptocurrency ICO options, offering users a safe, smooth experience without leaving a trace. Privacy isn't a bonus here, it's the default mode.

Cold Wallet is offering a practical fix to a widespread problem. Its design is built for lasting use and meaningful adoption. The native $CWT unit powers system functions such as decentralized governance, access to privacy layers, and user-driven feedback systems.

Currently in presale stage 12 at $0.0087, well under the $0.3517 listing target, Cold Wallet creates an appealing setup for early supporters seeking substantial future gains.

Those holding $CWT can weigh in on future developments, such as added blockchain support, new features, and collaboration opportunities. As privacy-based platforms gain support across DeFi and broader enterprise sectors, Cold Wallet's early-stage access opens the door to high-potential entry.

Rather than acting as a placeholder, $CWT is designed for real use. As adoption grows, so does demand, aligning with a projected 4,900% return.

Today's crypto enthusiasts are increasingly looking at usable platforms with actual privacy solutions. Cold Wallet supports both everyday users and professionals without lowering standards for safety or performance.

It helps DeFi users protect their identity while giving high-volume users the tools to stay discreet. Its growth plan covers browser extensions, mobile features, multi-chain access, and integrations for larger organizations.

With tighter privacy laws and scrutiny from regulators, Cold Wallet's purpose becomes more urgent. Analysts forecast its current $0.0087 value could reach $0.71 or beyond if adoption aligns with predictions.

Cold Wallet stands out among cryptocurrency ICO projects with its mix of practical function, privacy-first approach, and readiness for real-world usage.

This isn't just a product aiming for quick traction. Cold Wallet uses a zero-knowledge base, does not allow external trackers, and gives users full command over how they interact with crypto systems.



Offered at $0.0087 in presale stage 12 and expected to list at $0.3517, the projected ROI is a striking 4,900%. But beyond numbers, Cold Wallet's practical approach to privacy and user control puts it in a category of its own. For anyone searching for a top cryptocurrency ICO, Cold Wallet may turn out to be one of this year's most talked-about stories.

 Filings with the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission showed only a few small contributions from individuals tied to crypto companies for various candidates. 

As voters head to the ballot boxes to cast their choices for candidates in the Democratic and Republican primaries in New Jersey's race for its next governor, funds from crypto traders and interest groups don't seem to be as much of a factor as they were in the 2024 federal races.

According to filings with the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission reviewed by Cointelegraph as of Tuesday, no significant political action committees (PACs) funded by cryptocurrency companies or interest groups appeared to have contributed to any of the 12 Democratic and Republican candidates running for governor.

In a search for contributions directly to candidates or PACs, only a few filings suggested any connections to the crypto industry. 

There was a $500 contribution to Democratic candidate Josh Gottheimer's campaign from mining company MARA Holdings' vice president of investor relations, Robert Samuels, and a $900 contribution to Republican candidate Jon Bramnick from Rohan Varkey, a strategic finance senior analyst at Block. 

In addition, a Coinbase consultant, Miti Sathe, donated $500 to Democratic candidate Steve Fulop, and Roshan Shah, co-founder and CEO of the New Jersey-based mining company Decimal Digital Currency, contributed $2,000 to Democratic candidate Ras Baraka.

The filings for the roughly $4,000 in donations Cointelegraph was able to locate ahead of the Tuesday primaries were paltry compared to the crypto industry's efforts to support candidates in the 2024 elections, both through direct contributions and media buys through PACs like Fairshake, which spent more than $130 million on congressional races. 

Fairshake and its affiliate Protect Progress used more than $450,000 to support Robert Menendez Jr. and Gottheimer in their respective Democratic primaries for US House of Representatives seats in 2024. 

Related: What role did crypto voters play in the 2024 US election?

Though seemingly not as financially involved in the New Jersey gubernatorial race, the crypto advocacy group Stand With Crypto, affiliated with Coinbase, organized a “get out the vote” rally on Thursday, allowing three candidates for the governorship to speak to crypto-minded residents. Gottheimer, Fulop and Republican candidate Bill Spadea expressed views that were supportive of digital assets at the event.

A spokesperson for Stand With Crypto told Cointelegraph after the event that the organization's PAC had not yet used any of its funds to support candidates in the state's gubernatorial election. Cointelegraph reached out to representatives of Coinbase and Fairshake but had not received responses at the time of publication.

According to a June 4 report from AdImpact, the gubernatorial primary was set to become the most expensive election in the state's history, with more than $85 million spent to support or oppose candidates. Data showed PACs and interest groups spent more than $22 million on Gottheimer's campaign, though the report did not mention funding from crypto companies.

As the AI arms race continues to heat up from the Big Tech companies on down, and AI is fused into just about every industry there is, the inevitable panic is also beginning to set in: when AI “replaces” us—whether we be doctors, engineers, lawyers, teachers, financial analysts or writers—just how in the hell are we going to be able to make any money? 

Take a deep breath. Don't panic. If you look just a little closer, this is the logical extension of what we saw with so much automation of the information age in the last few decades, if not the industrial age of the last few centuries. The original tech paranoiacs were the Luddites, the class of British workers who objected to the increased use of mechanized looms and knitting frames. These were artisans who had given their lifeblood, creatively and physically, to a craft, and they argued that those now operating these new machines were taking away their livelihoods. Sound familiar?These protests rose to the level of violence, including the destruction of factories where these machines were being operated. Whatever short-term catharsis this might have provided to the Luddites, it was not a very effective long-term strategy. The mechanized looms and their descendants won out in the marketplace of money and ideas.

The very human problem of existential crises in the face of machine-based integration is not just a tale as old as time, but one that inevitably keeps repeating in any era where man has come to rely on some type of technology. Amazon had its own version of the Luddites in the early 2000s when it introduced the first robots to automate its warehouse operations, with employees experiencing the same fears the Luddites did. 

Who knows, there were probably even protests against the wheel by those who had made their livelihood carrying items on their back, it just wasn't documented. No one ever wins by moving backwards, only by figuring out how they adapt to the current tide that is always moving forward.

In this most recent stage of AI development, it is just the latest, and perhaps the last stage, of a fully automated information age, effectively bringing an end to that information age and bringing on the next new thing, whatever that might be. It might seem strange and dangerous now, but all it requires is the kind of small-scale and large-scale adaptation we've always had to make.

As the development of artificial intelligence exponentially proliferates, economies are contending with the fact that they've historically worked by being very labor-driven and the uncertainty that is created when the burden of labor shifts almost entirely away from humans to algorithms in the form of AI agents. Whether it's physical labor, manual labor, intellectual labor, or creative labor, it has always been labor that has served as the locus of monetization.

No one has yet proposed a workable solution for what will succeed this centering of labor. A popular alternative that is often proposed is Universal Basic Income, which negates labor in monetization entirely. However, this has never been practicable outside of very small pilots because it does not sufficiently take into account hierarchies and priorities driven by the innately human desire for incentivization.

When looking at the disruption caused by the technology revolutions of the past, we tend to focus on the technology itself, rather than how that technology was deployed and who was deploying it. The fears around these technologies are not really about the technologies themselves, but how those with economic power were able to exploit these technologies, and the creative labor they were mimicking, to create greater economic imbalance.

As a means of protection against this outcome, we propose a different kind of UBI: Universal Baseline Intellect. Just as the mechanization of the industrial age took human patterns of physical creation and merely repeated them on assembly lines, the same is now taking place when it comes to the patterns of ideas-based creation. Intellect is being utilized, thus, it deserves to be monetized. We need to ensure that the proper value is being attributed to the input being put into these new systems, and not necessarily on the output, not just because it is the right and fair thing to do, but because it will create the full buy-in across industries at all levels to sustain this new economy.

In building a new economy with new priorities, we have to ensure that individuals retain the right to the usage and monetization of their own intellectual property. Of all the avenues available to do this, decentralization has offered perhaps the easiest and best means of ensuring ownership belongs to the original possessor, with unmatched ability to monetize every type of intellectual “asset” in the digital space. We must prioritize an Intellect Economy where personal AI agents that learn from the human experience are also owned by that very human, and can create earning opportunities on an ongoing basis.We still have time to make the new AI economy a transformative shift that works for the many, rather than a dangerous disruption that enriches the few at the expense of those many. As we transition to a post-agentic, post-web world, shifting from attention-based to intention-driven systems, we need solutions that ensure humans remain at the center of intelligence. If we can do that, then the fears around AI will turn into hopes of liberating humanity from the chains of useless labor and toward a better and more enlightened form of intellectual value creation. 

Syed Hussain is the founder and CEO of SHIZA (Shared Human Intellect Zonal Agents). SHIZA is building a future where the richness of the human experience: personal insights, skills, preferences, and knowledge can be captured, owned, and monetized by the humans creating them. In the SHIZA ecosystem, users can create their own custom knowledge stores, called “Intellects,” which represent their unique thinking patterns and problem-solving approaches. SHIZA pioneers digital sovereignty by empowering individuals to own their AI and transform their intellect into valuable digital assets. SHIZA's LLM agnostic orchestration layer and cryptographically secured ILMs (Individualized Language Models) ensure personal data remains private by transforming human intellect into sovereign AI agents.

Bitcoin's BTC$110,203.47 rise to new all-time highs is happening on a backdrop of deep economic strain, according to a new report from Cathie Wood-led ARK Invest.

Bitcoin's 11.1% climb in May, outpaced gold and broke through key resistance levels, said ARK. Gains also coincided with clear signs of stress in the housing and auto sectors, traditionally seen as pillars of U.S. consumer strength.

In housing, the number of sellers has far outpaced buyers, a trend ARK links to the Federal Reserve's steep rate hikes since 2022. With affordability deteriorating, pressure is mounting on prices in what remains the largest source of household net worth. Meanwhile, auto sales, which surged earlier this year in anticipation of tariffs, collapsed in May — falling to 15.6 million units from above 17 million just a month prior.

As these markets soften, bitcoin appears to be catching some of the capital looking for yield and resilience, ARK noted. Spot bitcoin ETFs drew $5.5 billion in May — more than triple the inflows seen in gold ETFs, which dropped sharply during the same period.

ARK noted that bitcoin's current rally doesn't yet reflect speculative excess. Profit-taking behavior remains measured, with unrealized gains sitting well below the levels that marked prior bubbles.

For investors moving away from stressed real-world assets, bitcoin may be serving not as a gamble, but as a calculated reallocation in a shifting economic landscape.

 Trump's tax cuts and soaring US debt fuel Bitcoin's rise as a hedge against sovereign default risks, potentially pushing BTC price toward $200,000 or more by 2025. 

Key takeaways:

Bitwise predicts Bitcoin could hit $200,000 by year-end, with a potential “fair value” of $230,000.

Trump's proposed tax cuts and rising US debt position Bitcoin as a hedge against sovereign default risks.

Bitcoin's OTT signal suggests strong momentum after a dip to $100,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) could surpass $200,000 by the end of the year and eventually reach its estimated “fair value” of $230,000, according to Bitwise researchers André Dragosch and Ayush Tripathi.

In their weekly crypto outlook, Dragosch and Tripathi cite the US's soaring federal debt and mandatory spending exceeding revenues, exacerbated by Trump's proposed “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” tax cuts, as key drivers of their bullish Bitcoin prediction.

The Congressional Budget Office forecasts net interest payments tripling to $3 trillion by 2030, raising default fears.

“Bitcoin's scarcity and resilience position it uniquely to benefit from both fiscal instability and improving market sentiment,” Bitwise analysts said. If these trends hold, the top crypto could shatter price expectations by year-end.

An example of such “sovereign stress” is Bitcoin's performance in the wake of the Donald Trump-Elon Musk feud last week, driven by the latter's criticism of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

BTC's price declined 6% to almost $100,000 amid the spat, only to recover sharply over the weekend.

“Despite a short-lived dip to $100K during the Musk-Trump spat, BTC quickly rebounded on short liquidations,” wrote Bitwise, adding: 

Adding to Bitwise's outlook, a May 28 analysis by Stockmoney Lizards highlights a bullish Bitcoin breakout indicator. 

The signal comes from the Optimized Trend Tracker (OTT), which triggered for the first time since mid-2024, suggesting Bitcoin will potentially reach $200,000 in 2025, with a possible extension to $250,000.

Last month, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan told Cointelegraph that the BTC price will hit $200,000 by the end of 2025, driven by a supply shock from surging institutional demand.

A “power law” model that has accurately called Bitcoin tops and bottoms in the past cycles further hints at BTC price hitting $200,000 by year's end.

The deaths were likely tied to a Civil War battle.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Digging through an American Revolution gunpowder storage site resulted a discovery from a completely different war: the remains of four Confederate soldiers who likely died following a Civil War battle. 

As archaeologists with the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation excavated a site in search of American Revolution history, the team instead first came across the eye sockets of a human skull, according to a report from the Associated Press, before uncovering four skeletons and three amputated legs the experts believe are from Civil War casualties. 

One skeleton has a Minié bullet—a common round of ammunition used in the Civil War—lodged in the spine, as does the foot of one of the amputated legs. With the available evidence, the experts deduced that the remains were likely from a makeshift hospital that functioned near the site during the Civil War, and they later dug through archives to find handwritten lists of soldiers that were admitted to the hospital following the Battle of Williamsburg. 

With the lists in hand, the research team was able to start the process of identifying the soldiers. “It is the key,” Jack Gary, Colonial Williamsburg's executive director of archaeology, told the AP. “If these men were found in a mass grave on a battlefield, and there was no other information, we probably wouldn't be trying to do this.” 

The list of the wounded was part of a private family's archival documents which, at some point, were given to nearby William & Mary University. The researchers went through the detailed documentation, which included everything from names and regiments to dates of deaths and amputation information, for over 60 soldiers. 

Using the thorough information from the list, experts believe the four soldiers came from regiments tied to Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Virginia. They even have some individual names in mind, keeping those close to the vest until they can work with possible descendants using DNA from the soldiers' teeth. Gary said the goal is to ensure an “ironclad” identification. 

The Battle of Williamsburg occurred on May 5, 1862. Experts believe that the roughly 25,000 men who fought for the Union and Confederate armies included 2,283 Union soldiers killed, wounded, captured, or missing and 1,560 for the Confederates. 

The remains, which were initially discovered in 2023, were carefully buried with their arms crossed, indication they did not die during the battle, as those men were traditionally placed in trenches and then moved to a cemetery, Gary said. 

The four soldiers were out of uniform, as evidenced by buttons and a buckle, commonly found on more comfortable clothes, that the archaeologists also found. Archaeologist Eric Schweickart told the AP that one soldier had two $5 gold coins from 1852, and they also found a toothbrush made from animal bone and a snuff bottle.

The AP reports that William & Mary's Institute for Historical Biology believes the youngest soldier was between 15 and 19 years old and the oldest could have been up to 55 years old.

The remains were given a true burial, even as the investigation into their identity continues. “Everyone deserves dignity in death,” Gary said. “And being stored in a drawer inside a laboratory does not do that.”

Young exoplanets provide a critical link between understanding planet formation and atmospheric evolution1. Direct imaging spectroscopy allows us to infer the properties of young, wide orbit, giant planets with high signal-to-noise. This allows us to compare this young population to exoplanets characterized with transmission spectroscopy, which has indirectly revealed the presence of clouds2-4, photochemistry5, and a diversity of atmospheric compositions6-7. Direct detections have also been made for brown dwarfs8-9, but direct studies of young giant planets in the mid-infrared were not possible prior to JWST10. With two exoplanets around a solar type star, the YSES-1 system is an ideal laboratory for studying this early phase of exoplanet evolution. We report the first direct observations of silicate clouds in the atmosphere of the exoplanet YSES-1 c through its 9-11 µm absorption feature, and the first circumplanetary disk silicate emission around its sibling planet, YSES-1 b. The clouds of YSES-1 c are composed of either amorphous iron-enriched pyroxene or a combination of amorphous MgSiO3 and Mg2SiO4, with particle sizes of ≤0.1 μm at 1 millibar of pressure. We attribute the emission from the disk around YSES-1 b to be from submicron olivine dust grains, which may have formed through collisions of planet-forming bodies in the disk.

Science-integrity sleuths check the text and images in published papers for errors and inconsistencies. Credit: tadamichi/Getty

A group of research-integrity experts has launched a toolkit for researchers that outlines how to spot suspicious scientific papers.

The guide's creators hope that it will be a useful resource for sleuths who review published work for signs of sloppy, fake or fraudulent science, and perhaps inspire others to get started. “The sleuthing community is growing. And this will be the essential handbook,” says Jana Christopher, an image-integrity analyst at FEBS Press in Heidelberg, Germany, who contributed to the project.

The Collection of Open Science Integrity Guides (COSIG) brings together 27 freely available resources that explain how to spot image duplication, citation manipulation, plagiarism, tortured phrases and other hallmarks of paper mills — businesses that produce fake papers to order. The guides also provide tips for reviewing papers in specific disciplines, including biology, chemistry, statistics and computer science.

“COSIG is really a compendium of all the tips and tricks that various sleuths have acquired over the years,” says Reese Richardson, a metascientist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who led the project and authored a preprint on COSIG posted to the repository Zenodo on 4 June1. “We want to arm scientists with the tools to uphold the integrity of the literature.”

“It will really help publishers, as well,” says Christopher, adding that research-integrity officers could use the guide as the basis for checklists to evaluate manuscripts.

Richardson came up with the idea for COSIG last year, while at a meeting of science-integrity specialists in Paris. Concerned about the surge in formulaic research and flawed publications that continue to circulate largely unnoticed, he and other delegates wanted to broaden participation in correcting the literature and to help more people learn how to scrutinize papers.

“A lot of people assume that you need some special talent, you need eagle eyes to see things, or you need to be at your computer ten hours a day looking through the scientific literature. But really, anybody can do it,” says Richardson. “That's one of our mantras.”

The guides describe how to spot issues that are common across all disciplines, such as text that has been generated using artificial intelligence (AI), and publications from hijacked journals — scam websites that impersonate legitimate journals. They include instructions for how to use online tools such as the Feet of Clay Detector, which flags papers citing retracted or problematic research, and Imagetwin and Proofig, which use AI to detect integrity issues in scientific figures.

Some of the guides home in on areas of research that have seen a recent surge in formulaic publications, and those that are frequently targeted by paper mills.

For example, one guide shows how to detect experiments that use non-existent cell lines, or contaminated ones that are no longer suitable for studying certain cancers. Another outlines how to check that tumour sizes in rodent studies fall within limits approved by institutional ethics committees (a reported size that is too large to have been approved can be a sign of manipulated or fabricated experiments).

There are examples of papers that conflate a substance's composition by weight with the number of each atom type, or instances in which an X-ray diffraction pattern doesn't match a crystal's properties.

“Every guide specifies what features of an article actually warrant additional scepticism and what features are totally benign or standard practice,” explains Richardson.

The Trump administration is still refusing to enforce a federal ban on TikTok, and Silicon Valley software engineer Tony Tan is fed up. Last month, Tan sued the US Department of Justice for allegedly failing to turn over records about why it has not taken action against Google and Apple, which Tan believes are violating the law by continuing to host TikTok on their respective app stores.

Tan is now stepping up his fight against what he sees as a worrying and potentially costly trend away from respecting the American legal system. On Tuesday, he filed a shareholder lawsuit in Delaware state court against Google's parent organization Alphabet. Tan alleges the company wrongfully denied a request he made for internal documents about Google's decision to risk billions of dollars in fines by not complying with the TikTok ban.

“The biggest thing that motivates me here is I've been frustrated by the volume of recent attacks on our legal system,” says Tan, who is in his late twenties and owns a small number of Alphabet shares directly and through investment funds. “If Google is outright breaking the law, and they don't have to acknowledge it, they very much are above the law, and that doesn't seem right to me.”

Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. But in a letter to Tan's attorneys seen by WIRED, a lawyer representing Google questioned whether the tech giant was really violating the TikTok ban, calling the idea an “unsupported legal conclusion.” Tan's records request “appears simply to be wondering if Alphabet is complying with applicable laws,” Doru Gavril, a partner at the firm Freshfields, wrote in March. “Curiosity alone is not a basis for a books and records inspection demand.”

TikTok's future in the United States has been under threat for years. President Donald Trump tried banning the app during his first term in 2020, arguing it posed a risk to national security because it was run by ByteDance, a Chinese tech company. After years of congressional debate and a legal battle that made it up to the Supreme Court, a law banning companies such as Apple and Google from helping to distribute TikTok and other Chinese apps in the US went into effect this past January.

TikTok then disappeared from app stores for about half a day, until Trump issued an executive order pausing enforcement of the law and giving ByteDance time to reach a deal to reduce its ownership stake in TikTok's US operation. In the months since, Trump has used the popular video platform as a bargaining chip in high-stakes trade negotiations with China.

Legal experts and some lawmakers have questioned the legality of Trump's order, which expires June 19. But there haven't been any known legal challenges to it, and the president has indicated that he will extend the pause again as discussions with Beijing continue.

Tan, who declined to say whether he personally supports the TikTok ban, believes the central issue is enforcement. “There is a federal law that says the TikTok app should not be on your store, and I can see TikTok is on the app store,” he says of Google. “Congress passed the law, and the Supreme Court upheld it. It's not debatable.”

In his view, Google is openly ignoring the law, and he wants to understand the legal basis for that decision, as well as the extent to which shareholders should be worried about Google's potential liability. “I felt I should join the someones who are doing something,” Tan says.

Tan has a history of using records requests and litigation to investigate and combat what he views as injustices. In 2019, he sued a New Hampshire hotel for allegedly violating anti-discrimination laws by barring bookings from adults under 21 years old. Tan says he dropped the case after the hotel amended its policy.

This February, Tan filed a public records request with the US Department of Justice seeking copies of letters that Attorney General Pam Bondi reportedly sent to companies such as Google and Apple advising them that they would not be held liable for continuing to distribute TikTok. After the attorney general's office claimed it did not have records matching Tan's request, he took the Department of Justice to court. (The New York Times has filed a similar lawsuit.) In a court filing, the Justice Department denied any wrongdoing.

In March, Tan requested minutes and materials from meetings of Alphabet's board of directors related to the TikTok ban, including the same reported letter from the attorney general. Tan made his request under a law in Delaware, where Alphabet is incorporated, that allows shareholders acting in “good faith” to inspect “books and records” when investigating suspected mismanagement. Through a series of exchanges between Alphabet's attorneys and his, Tan learned that the company possessed about half a dozen relevant documents but that it wouldn't turn them over unless ordered to do so by a court.

“The board minutes will show whether or not the board discussed the risks associated with making the TikTok application available through Google Play and, if so, whether and how they assessed the risk of liability,” Tan's lawsuit filed on Tuesday states. “The board minutes will also show whether the board considered whether making TikTok available through Google Play constituted a positive violation of federal law.”

Companies that violate the TikTok ban by continuing to distribute the app can face penalties of up to $5,000 per user. Tan's lawsuit alleges that Google should not be relying on Trump's executive order and Bondi's letter alone to shield them from legal risks, and that the tech giant could be held liable by a future president—or even by Trump, who is known to frequently change his mind.

Gavril, the attorney representing Google, contended in one exchange with the attorneys representing Tan that “a lot of planets would have to align for that hypothetical harm to become reality. Some would argue that a concerned shareholder should wait for there to be an actual harm before progressing to investigate how it came to be.”

Alphabet and Apple have yet to specifically mention the TikTok law in shareholder disclosures listing risks to their businesses. Akamai, which provides content hosting services to TikTok, wrote in a February disclosure that the attorney general determined the company could continue serving the app “without incurring any legal liability” but added “there is no assurance that we will not be exposed to liability” in the future.

Tan says that many incidents under Trump 2.0 this year have left him concerned about the rule of law, the foundational democratic principle that everyone should be treated the same way by the government. But the TikTok situation was one he felt capable of investigating, and as a shareholder of tech companies such as Alphabet, he felt a duty to try to protect his own bottom line. “If these companies are openly willing to break the law, will others be pressured into breaking the law because it's politically convenient?” he says. “Will shareholders be left holding the bag when the legal liability comes due?”

Tan says his work in tech has nothing to do with TikTok or Google, but in general he doesn't want the industry he is in to be part of a trend toward what he considers flagrant lawbreaking. He claims no one—not even friends and family—has encouraged him to pursue his lawsuits over the TikTok ban. His attorneys at Berger McDermott have represented Meta in the past, but the social media company has no hand in his cases, he says. Tan adds he is paying standard rates for his legal representation. “It's been expensive,” he says, “and it's going to be more expensive.”

Tan explains that he prioritized challenging Google over other companies, including California-incorporated Apple, partly because of the Delaware law allowing him to seek internal records. In recent years, shareholders have filed an increasing number of these kinds of requests, with the hope of using the obtained records as the basis for shareholder resolutions or lawsuits against executives and board members. Most requests are resolved informally, but some end up in court.

In March, Delaware enacted a law aimed at limiting the records companies must turn over, which could hamper Tan's request. Lawmakers in the state acknowledged they were under pressure to stop the flight of companies like Tesla to jurisdictions with more business-friendly statutes.

Roy Shapira, a professor of law at Reichman University who studies corporate governance in Delaware, says that shareholders trying to hold a company accountable for intentionally violating the law may now find it even more difficult “to show what directors knew and when they knew it.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The ‘Long-Term Danger' of Trump Sending Troops to the LA Protests","https://www.wired.com/story/trump-marines-national-guard-la-protests/","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 16:24:17 GMT","

As hundreds of United States Marines deploy in Los Angeles under presidential orders to protect federal property amid growing protests over immigration enforcement, constitutional scholars and civil rights attorneys warn of long-term implications for American democracy and civil-military relations.

President Donald Trump revealed Monday that he had ordered the deployment of more than 700 activity-duty Marines out of Camp Pendleton—an extraordinary use of military force in response to civil unrest. The move, widely condemned by his critics, follows Trump's federalization of the National Guard. Some 3,800 guardsmen have since been deployed in California against the objections of its government, spurring debate among legal observers over the limits of the president's power to send troops into American streets.

Trump ordered the deployments in response to thousands of Angelenos who took to the streets on Friday in protests. LA residents responded after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents carried out sweeping raids of local businesses, arresting, among others, dozens of day laborers who were vying for work outside a local Home Depot. Larger demonstrations soon formed and remained largely peaceful until residents were engaged by police with riot shields and crowd control weapons. Over the weekend, the clashes between police and protesters escalated across many neighborhoods with large immigrant populations. Numerous buildings were vandalized with anti-ICE messages, and several Waymo autonomous vehicles were set ablaze.

Videos captured by protest attendees show police firing upon demonstrators with rubber bullets and other crowd control agents, including waves of asphyxiating CS gas. Members of the press shared images online showing injuries they incurred from the police assault. In widely shared footage, a law enforcement officer appears to intentionally target an Australian reporter, Lauren Tomasi, shooting her from feet away with a rubber bullet as she delivers a monologue into a camera. On Monday, CNN correspondent Jason Carroll was arrested live on air.

California governor Gavin Newsom condemned Trump's troop deployment in posts on social media, calling the president's actions an “unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.” His attorney general, Rob Bonta, has filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming the order violated the state's sovereignty, infringing on Newsom's authority as the California National Guard's commander in chief.

In response to a request for comment, the Department of Defense referred WIRED to a US Northern Command press release detailing the deployment of Marines and National Guardsmen.

Federal troops in the United States are ordinarily barred from participating in civilian law enforcement activities. This rule, known as “posse comitatus,” may be suspended, however, by a sitting president in cases of civil unrest or outright rebellion. This exception—permitted under the Insurrection Act—allows the president to deploy troops when circumstances make it “impracticable” for state authorities to enforce federal law by “ordinary” means.

While these powers are most often invoked at the request of a state government, the president may also invoke the act when a state chooses to ignore the constitutional rights of its inhabitants—as happened multiple times in the mid-20th century, when southern states refused to desegregate schools after the Supreme Court's landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision.

President Trump, however, has so far not invoked the Insurrection Act, relying instead on a theory of “inherent authority” advanced by the US Justice Department in 1971 during the height of the anti–Vietnam War protests. This interpretation of presidential power finds that troops may be deployed in an effort to “protect federal property and functions.” Notably—unlike the Insurrection Act—this does not permit troops to engage in activities that are generally the purview of civilian law enforcement agencies.

Trump also invoked statutory power granted to him by Congress under Title 10 of the US Code, which enabled him to federalize elements of California's National Guard. These activations typically occur when guardsmen are needed to support overseas military operations, as happened routinely this century during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Domestically, however, guardsmen are not usually federalized without the agreement of a state's governor—unless the Insurrection Act has been invoked.

Legal experts interviewed by WIRED offered a range of opinions on the president's authority to deploy active-duty military troops or federalize the National Guard. While most believe it is likely within Trump's power to ignore Newsom's express objections, doing so without an invocation of the Insurrection Act, they say, is a decision fraught with legal complexities that carries serious implications, from altering—perhaps permanently—the fundamental relationship between Americans, states, and the federal government, to disturbing the delicate balance between civilian governance and military power.

Liza Goitein, senior director of the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program, underscores the “unprecedented” nature of Trump's approach. “He's trying to basically exercise the powers of the Insurrection Act without invoking it,” she says. A key issue for Goitein is that the memorandum signed by Trump last week federalizing the National Guard makes no mention of Los Angeles or California. Rather, it states that the guardsmen are being mobilized to address protests that are both “occurring” and “likely to occur.”

In essence, the memo “authorizes the deployment of federal troops anywhere in the country,” Goitein says, “including places where there are no protests yet. We're talking about preemptive deployment.”

Goitein argues that the administration's justifications could undermine both judicial accountability and civil‑military boundaries. Under the Insurrection Act, federal troops can take on the responsibilities of local and state police. But without it, their authority should be quite limited. Neither the guardsmen nor the Marines, for instance, should engage with protesters acting peacefully, according to Goitein. “He says they're there to protect federal property,” she says. “But it looks a lot like quelling civil unrest.”

Anthony Kuhn, a 28-year US Army veteran and managing partner at Tully Rinckey, believes, meanwhile, that there is really “no question” that Trump would be justified in declaring a “violent rebellion” underway in California, empowering him to ignore Newsom's objections. The images and video of protesters hurling rocks and other items at police and lighting cars on fire all serve as evidence toward that conclusion.

“I know people in California, the governor, the mayor, are trying to frame it as a protest. But at this point,” says Kuhn, “it's a violent rebellion. You can draw your own conclusions from the pictures and videos floating around.” Kuhn argues that the intentions of the protesters, the politics fueling the demonstrations, don't matter. “They're attacking federal facilities. They're destroying federal property. So in an attempt to restore the peace, the president has the authority under Title 10 to deploy troops. It's pretty straightforward.”

In contrast, Rutgers University professor Bruce Afran says deploying military forces against Americans is “completely unconstitutional” in the absence of a true state of domestic insurrection. “There was an attack on ICE's offices, the doorways, there was some graffiti, there were images of protesters breaking into a guardhouse, which was empty,” he says. “But even if it went to the point of setting a car on fire, that's not a domestic insurrection. That's a protest that is engaged in some illegality. And we have civil means to punish it without the armed forces.”

Afran argues that meddling with the expectations of civilians, who naturally anticipate interacting with police but not armed soldiers, can fundamentally alter the relationship between citizens and their government, even blurring the line between democracy and authoritarianism. “The long-term danger is that we come to accept the role of the army in regulating civilian protest instead of allowing local law enforcement to do the job,” he says. “And once we accept that new paradigm—to use a kind of BS word—the relationship between the citizen and the government is altered forever.”

“Violent rioters in Los Angeles, enabled by Democrat governor Gavin Newsom, have attacked American law enforcement, set cars on fire, and fueled lawless chaos,"" Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, tells WIRED. ""President Trump rightfully stepped in to protect federal law enforcement officers. When Democrat leaders refuse to protect American citizens, President Trump will always step in.”

As the orders to mobilize federal troops have come down, some users on social media have urged service members to consider the orders unlawful and refuse to obey—a move that legal experts say would be very difficult to pull off.

David Coombs, a lecturer in criminal procedure and military law at the University of Buffalo and a veteran of the US Army's Judge Advocate General's Corps, says it's hypothetically possible that troops could question whether Trump has the authority to mobilize state guardsmen over the objection of a state governor. “I think ultimately the answer to that will be yes,” he says. “But it is a gray area. When you look at the chain of command, it envisions the governor controlling all of these individuals.”

Separately, says Coombs, when troops are ordered to mobilize, they could—again, hypothetically—refuse to engage in activities that are beyond the scope of the president's orders, such as carrying out immigration raids or making arrests. “All they can do in this case, under Title 10 status, is protect the safety of federal personnel and property. If you go beyond that, then it violates the Posse Comitatus Act.” Federal troops, for instance, would need civilian police to step in at the point that local authorities want peaceful protesters to disperse.

The San Francisco Chronicle reports that, in a letter on Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem requested that military troops be directed to detain alleged “lawbreakers” during protests “or arrest them,” which legal experts almost universally agree would be illegal under ordinary circumstances. The letter was addressed to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and accused the anti-ICE protesters of being “violent, insurrectionist mobs” aiming to “protect invaders and military aged males belonging to identified foreign terrorist organizations.”

Khun, who warns there's a big difference between philosophizing over what constitutes an unlawful order and disobeying commands, dismisses the idea that troops, in the heat of the moment, will have an option. “It's not going to be litigated in the middle of an actual deployment,” he says. “There's no immediate relief, no immediate way to prove that an order is unlawful.”

Khun says that were he deployed into a similar situation, “me and my junior soldiers would not respond to a nonviolent or peaceful protest.” Asked what protesters should expect, should they engage with federal troops trained for combat overseas, Kuhn says the Marines will hold their ground more firmly than police, who are often forced to retreat as mobs approach. In addition to being armed with the same crowd control weapons, Marines are extensively trained in close-quarters combat.

“I would expect a defensive response,” he says, “but not lethal force.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Airlines Don't Want You to Know They Sold Your Flight Data to DHS","https://www.wired.com/story/airlines-dont-want-you-to-know-they-sold-your-flight-data-to-dhs/","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

A data broker owned by the country's major airlines, including Delta, American Airlines, and United, collected US travelers' domestic flight records, sold access to them to Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and then as part of the contract told CBP to not reveal where the data came from, according to internal CBP documents obtained by 404 Media. The data includes passenger names, their full flight itineraries, and financial details.

This article was created in partnership with 404 Media, a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. For more stories like this, sign up here.

CBP, a part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), says it needs this data to support state and local police to track people of interest's air travel across the country, in a purchase that has alarmed civil liberties experts.

The documents reveal for the first time in detail why at least one part of DHS purchased such information, and comes after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detailed its own purchase of the data. The documents also show for the first time that the data broker, called the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC), tells government agencies not to mention where it sourced the flight data from.

“The big airlines—through a shady data broker that they own called ARC—are selling the government bulk access to Americans' sensitive information, revealing where they fly and the credit card they used,” senator Ron Wyden said in a statement.

ARC is owned and operated by at least eight major US airlines, other publicly released documents show. The company's board of directors include representatives from Delta, Southwest, United, American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, JetBlue, and European airlines Lufthansa and Air France, and Canada's Air Canada. More than 240 airlines depend on ARC for ticket settlement services.

ARC's other lines of business include being the conduit between airlines and travel agencies, finding travel trends in data with other firms like Expedia, and fraud prevention, according to material on ARC's YouTube channel and website. The sale of US fliers' travel information to the government is part of ARC's Travel Intelligence Program (TIP).

A Statement of Work included in the newly obtained documents, which describes why an agency is buying a particular tool or capability, says CBP needs access to ARC's TIP product “to support federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to identify persons of interest's US domestic air travel ticketing information.” 404 Media obtained the documents through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.

The new documents obtained by 404 Media also show ARC asking CBP to “not publicly identify vendor, or its employees, individually or collectively, as the source of the Reports unless the Customer is compelled to do so by a valid court order or subpoena and gives ARC immediate notice of same.”

The Statement of Work says that TIP can show a person's paid intent to travel and tickets purchased through travel agencies in the US and its territories. The data from the Travel Intelligence Program (TIP) will provide “visibility on a subject's or person of interest's domestic air travel ticketing information as well as tickets acquired through travel agencies in the U.S. and its territories,” the documents say. They add that this data will be “crucial” in both administrative and criminal cases.

A DHS Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) available online says that TIP data is updated daily with the previous day's ticket sales, and contains more than one billion records spanning 39 months of past and future travel. The document says TIP can be searched by name, credit card, or airline, but ARC contains data from ARC-accredited travel agencies, such as Expedia, and not flights booked directly with an airline. “If the passenger buys a ticket directly from the airline, then the search done by ICE will not show up in an ARC report,” that PIA says. The PIA notes that the data impacts both US and non-US persons, meaning it does include information on US citizens.

“While obtaining domestic airline data—like many other transaction and purchase records—generally doesn't require a warrant, there's still supposed to go through a legal process that ensures independent oversight and limits data collection to records that will support an investigation,” Jake Laperruque, deputy director of the Center for Democracy & Technology's Security and Surveillance Project, told 404 Media in an email. “As with many other types of sensitive and revealing data, the government seems intent on using data brokers to buy their way around important guardrails and limits.”

CBP's contract with ARC started in June 2024 and may extend to 2029, according to the documents. The CBP contract 404 Media obtained documents for was an $11,025 transaction. Last Tuesday, a public procurement database added a $6,847.50 update to that contract, which said it was exercising “Option Year 1,” meaning it was extending the contract. The documents are redacted but briefly mention CBP's OPR, or Office of Professional Responsibility, which in part investigates corruption by CBP employees.

“CBP is committed to protecting individuals' privacy during the execution of its mission to protect the American people, safeguard our borders, and enhance the nation's economic prosperity. CBP follows a robust privacy policy as we protect the homeland through the air, land and maritime environments against illegal entry, illicit activity or other threats to national sovereignty and economic security,” a CBP spokesperson said in a statement. CBP added that the data is only used when an OPR investigation is open, and the agency needs to locate someone related to that investigation. The agency says the data can act as a good starting point to identify a relevant flight record before then getting more information through legal processes.

On May 1, ICE published details about its own ARC data purchase. In response, on May 2, 404 Media filed FOIA requests with ICE and a range of other agencies that 404 Media found had bought ARC's services, including CBP, the Secret Service, SEC, DEA, the Air Force, US Marshals Service, TSA, and ATF. 404 Media found these by searching US procurement databases. Around a week later, The Lever covered the ICE contract.

Airlines contacted by 404 Media declined to comment, didn't respond, or deferred to either ARC or DHS instead. ARC declined to comment. The company previously told The Lever that TIP “was established after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to provide certain data to law enforcement … for the purpose of national security matters” and criminal investigations.

“ARC has refused to answer oversight questions from Congress, so I have already contacted the major airlines that own ARC—like Delta, American Airlines, and United—to find out why they gave the green light to sell their customers' data to the government,” Wyden's statement added.

US law enforcement agencies have repeatedly turned to private companies to buy data rather than obtain it through legal processes such as search warrants or subpoenas. That includes location data harvested from smartphones, utility data, and internet backbone data.

“Overall it strikes me as yet another alarming example of how the ‘Big Data Surveillance Complex' is becoming the digital-age version of the military-industrial complex,” Laperruque says, referring to the purchase of airline data.

“It's clear the data broker loophole is pushing the government back towards a pernicious ‘collect it all' mentality, gobbling up as much sensitive data as it can about all Americans by default. A decade ago the public rejected that approach, and Congress passed surveillance reform legislation that banned domestic bulk collection. Clearly it's time for Congress to step in again, and stop the data broker loophole from being used to circumvent that ban,” he added.

According to ARC's website, the company only introduced multifactor authentication on May 15.

Meta plans to unveil a new AI research lab dedicated to “superintelligence” as the company works to compete in the AI race, according to several reports.

Meta has tapped Scale AI founder and CEO Alexandr Wang to join the new lab, The New York Times reports. Meta has been in talks to invest billions into Scale AI as part of a deal that would bring Scale AI employees to Meta. Meta has also been poaching lead researchers from OpenAI and Google, per the Times. 

The new lab comes as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg grows frustrated with his company's AI shortfalls. Bloomberg reports he has been meeting with AI researchers and engineers at his homes in Lake Tahoe and Palo Alto to personally recruit a team of around 50 people, including a new head of AI research. 

Sources told Bloomberg that Zuckerberg believes Meta can and should outpace other tech companies gunning to achieve AGI, the still-undefined idea that AI systems could exceed human performance in many tasks. 

Meta AI last month reached 1 billion monthly active users.

Apple has announced updates to the AI models that power its suite of Apple Intelligence features across iOS, macOS, and more. But according to the company's own benchmarks, the models underperform older models from rival tech firms, including OpenAI.

Apple said in a blog post Monday that human testers rated the quality of text generated by its newest “Apple On-Device” model — which runs offline on products, including the iPhone — “comparably” to, but not better than, text from similarly sized Google and Alibaba models. Meanwhile, those same testers rated Apple's more capable new model, which is called “Apple Server” and is designed to run in the company's data centers, behind OpenAI's year-old GPT-4o.

In a separate test evaluating the ability of Apple's models to analyze images, human raters preferred Meta's Llama 4 Scout model over Apple Server, according to Apple. That's a bit surprising. On a number of tests, Llama 4 Scout performs worse than leading models from AI labs like Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI.

The benchmark results add credence to reports suggesting Apple's AI research division has struggled to catch up to competitors in the cutthroat AI race. Apple's AI capabilities in recent years have underwhelmed, and a promised Siri upgrade has been delayed indefinitely. Some customers have sued Apple, accusing the firm of marketing AI features for its products that it hasn't yet delivered.

In addition to generating text, Apple On-Device, which is roughly 3 billion parameters in size, drives features like summarization and text analysis. (Parameters roughly correspond to a model's problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer parameters.) As of Monday, third-party developers can tap into it via Apple's Foundation Models framework.

Apple says both Apple On-Device and Apple Server boast improved tool use and efficiency compared to their predecessors, and can understand around 15 languages. That's thanks in part to an expanded training dataset that includes image data, PDFs, documents, manuscripts, infographics, tables, and charts.

I can't prove it but I think that it'll be hard getting a job here without speaking the language unless you're extra qualified. At least, that's my perspective in France but I might be 100% wrong since I actually never held an office job here.Not sure about Germany, but I would say that they speak better English than us French on average so that's where I would try my luck first if I was you.… except that German will be useless if you ever want to transition to Spain / Italy. Learning French would allow you to learn Spanish or Italian fast, but German wont.(This message is definitely a nothing burger concerning finding employment, but I hope it gave you some ideas to consider)

Alternatively, if you really want to go via an employment, look into the companies that have permission to ask for a knowledge migrant visa: https://ind.nl/en/public-register-recognised-sponsors/public...

So... any expats? Or Americans moving overseas? Or people from the USA moving to EU countries? These will be wildly different scenarios.For me it was signing a work contract in Switzerland and moving there from an EU country. The path to get that job was by finishing a good uni and having some work experience already while studying. Not sure this helps you much...

I believe, as others have stated, that the educational way is probably the most practical, as you can get a residency visa based on attending school (not necessarily a graduation, I know plenty of people that initially came to study the language, and that would qualify you for such visas), and subsequently after living there for a while follow the normal paths towards long-term residency.As far as I'm aware, the Netherlands and Germany are destinations that have reasonably well-understood processes for immigration and a significant technical market. Both of these countries also have the advantage that you can mostly live your life in English – albeit you should of course strive to learn the local language if you intend to settle there.For Germany specifically, there's been a recent reform in the laws which give you a very fast track even towards German citizenship, which then would allow you to live and work anywhere in the EU. On the other hand, the Netherlands seem to have a more digitalized bureaucracy, which can be practical: in Germany everything is still done by snail mail.I've also heard good things about Switzerland, but there I have less personal experience. It is also not in the EU, for what it's worth.That being said, I'd point out that from a technology market perspective, it's certainly more difficult to find employment at the moment than it was perhaps 10 years ago. This comes and goes in cycles, so I'm saying that so you don't get discouraged if it takes long and requires applying to hundreds of positions: that's the case even for us natives. There's geopolitical and macroeconomic reasons for that, interest rates, etc.I wish you the best of luck!P.S. Of course, if you're so inclined, you might want to be aware that Svalbard has no specific visa requirements for residence. You could conceptually move there tomorrow, as long as you're allowed to transit through Norway, which assuming you hold a US passport shouldn't be a problem.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SvalbardHowever that place is certainly... not for everyone :-)P.P.S. On a more serious note, and it's of course not the EU, but Australia has very friendly immigration paths and I personally know multiple people who were able to move there, quickly obtain work in technology, and two of them actually obtained Australian citizenship by now.

For example, if I am doing a PhD in France, with no intention of staying in France afterwards, wouldn't it be rather inaccurate to call myself an immigrant to France?


reply



An immigrant is someone who moves to a country other than their own with the intention of residing there for a significant period (usually at least one year), regardless of their ultimate intention to stay permanently or leave later.

If you're in a foreign country, you're either an immigrant (as a generic term) or, if you want to get pedantic, you can use whatever more apt definition they have (visitor, migrant worker, non-immigrant, etc).

The first pair of commercial augmented reality glasses to sport Google's newfangled Android XR aren't merely a wearable computer you can slip on and off with ease. Xreal's Project Aura glasses still aren't available, but the bare details about the device's specs offer a better idea of what the first pair of true AR glasses may look like—when and if you can actually buy them. While we all hoped we could simply tether our AR glasses to an Android device, you can expect that today's phones won't be enough to handle all the 3D and AI goodness packed inside.

At Augmented World Expo (AWE) on Tuesday, Xreal revealed a few scant details about its device that was already lacking much in the way of specifics. The company isn't showing off any more images of the device, nor is it offering regular folk the chance to try it. Instead, the AR glasses maker finally revealed that Aura won't be processing data on the glasses itself. It will instead use a separate, tethered, puck-like device that sits in your pocket. Like Xreal's other products, such as its recent One Pro, the glasses have the in-built wire, though you'll be able to disconnect from the processing device if you want to store the glasses and puck separately.

Additionally, Xreal finally offered some insight into what's powering its new device. Aura is working with two chipsets, one for the glasses and another for the compute device. The glasses frame will house a modified version of the X1 chip found in the Xreal One glasses, called X1S. The company has claimed it's a more powerful processor than the one found in the company's streaming glasses, but even that's not enough for its “optical-see-through” device. The puck will house a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip. The company didn't specify if it's the same Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 that's powering the only other fully revealed Android XR device, Samsung's Project Moohan.

Simply put, your phone isn't built for handling the same tasks, according to Xreal. Meta's Project Orion was the first AR prototype device announced so far that requires a similar “compute puck.” The need for an extra processing puck leaves me questioning whether these devices will have the battery capacity necessary for heavy use for more than a few hours. Xreal didn't offer details about battery life, though at least it confirmed the glasses will have front-facing sensors with added hand tracking, akin to the Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro.

Xreal offered more about the displays it's using in Aura. The glasses sport a new flat prism lens, rather than the larger “birdbath” lenses of older devices. This “flat prism” is a triangular-shaped pane of glass that's around 44% smaller than before, yet it should offer a larger field of view (FOV) of up to 70 degrees. That's a relatively wide FOV for a pair of AR glasses, far more than the 57-degree FOV of the Xreal One Pro, and it should offer something much closer to the experience of wearing a full VR headset, at least on the horizontal axis.

These glasses are built with many of the same apps as Project Moohan in mind. We've only seen a few short demos with Samsung's XR device and how it works in concert with Google's Gemini AI. Moohan should be able to operate most Android apps, but it can also add 3D functionality to apps like Google Maps. Gizmodo had the opportunity to try a different pair of Android XR glasses at last month's Google I/O, though that truncated demo paled in comparison to the navigation and memory capabilities Google has previously shown to the public.

Xreal hasn't offered any indication of a release date or price, but we can only assume it will be a while, and it will be very expensive. That processor will be pricey; reports suggest Moohan also will be a costly device. Aura's wired connection means you'll never truly be inconspicuous wearing the glasses unless you somehow try to finagle the wire to run down the inside of your shirt. A pair of $300 Ray-Ban Meta or similar smart glasses will still be far slimmer without the need for wired connections. Those devices aren't exactly cheap, but we'll have to see if consumers are truly ready for a device that costs closer to $1,000 just for the sake of having a tiny heads-up display on their spectacles.

Derek Guy, a fashion writer more commonly known as “the Menswear Guy” on X, posted Monday about his experience as an undocumented immigrant brought to the U.S. as a child. Far-right extremists quickly called for Guy to be deported, something that's not entirely unexpected on a social media platform that's turned into an even greater cesspool of hate ever since Elon Musk bought it. What turned out to be somewhat unexpected was the vice president of the United States and the Department of Homeland Security posting gifs to suggest they might really deport him.

It all started on Saturday, June 7, when Guy tweeted that while he admired the courage of protesters against ICE, he thought violent protests were counterproductive. Some folks on X and Bluesky thought Guy was lecturing people who were putting their bodies on the line in resistance to ICE round-ups in Los Angeles, stirring some criticism.

The following day, Guy seemed compelled to talk about his own experience with immigration, writing on X, “My family escaped Vietnam after the Tet Offensive and went through an arduous journey that eventually landed them in the Canada. My father worked there for a time as a janitor; my mother, a secretary.”

Guy went on to explain that when work fell through in Canada his father went to the U.S. “as our family needed money” and he ended up “staying longer than he was supposed to.” Guy writes that he was carried over the U.S.-Canada border by his mother while he was still a baby.

“I'm still unsure whether we technically broke an immigration law,” Guy wrote. “The border between Canada and the United States was pretty porous (as it is today, for the most part). But either way, since I came here without legal documentation, I eventually fell into the category of being an undocumented immigrant. Yet, I've been in the United States since I was a baby. My identity and roots are very much based in this country, no different from anyone else.”

I debated whether to share my story on here, but I guess I will.

I think there's an idea out there that millions of violent criminals are pouring across the border, carrying machetes and drugs, looking to harm Americans. Certainly, while some people fall into that category, the…

Guy went on to explain (in a very lengthy post) that most immigrants simply aren't violent criminals and that “sending us ‘back' to our ‘home' country would mean sending someone to a foreign land.” But the admission that Guy may be undocumented in the U.S. led to various X accounts calling for him to get kicked out of the country. 

An account called @growing_daniel wrote, “JD Vance I know you're reading this and you have the opportunity to do the funniest thing ever,” in a quote-tweet about Guy's immigration status. Vance replied with a GIF of actor Jack Nicholson vigorously nodding his head.

— JD Vance (@JDVance) June 9, 2025



Guy got a good burn in on the vice president, quote-tweeting Vance with “i think i can outrun you in these clothes.” Guy frequently critiques the fashion choices of conservative men, something that really seems to irk many of his followers, given the fact that they rely on him for advice on clothes. Guy has previously made fun of Vance's pants for being too short and skinny.

— derek guy (@dieworkwear) June 9, 2025



As if it wasn't bad enough that Vance was suggesting he might try to get Guy deported, the Department of Homeland Security posted a GIF from the movie Spy Kids, quote-tweeting a call for him to be deported. The suggestion being that they had their eyes on him.

— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) June 9, 2025



Far-right influencer Andy Ngo expressed skepticism of Guy's story about his family fleeing Vietnam, claiming he could be lying since he didn't publish his story in “a publication that goes through some level of independent verification.” The ironic part of that, of course, is that Ngo constantly posts garbage on X without any kind of “independent verification” as he puts it. 

Musk and his legion of far-right fans are so fond of saying the traditional media are dead and that you don't hate the mainstream journalists enough. But when someone tells their own story, they're quick to want some kind of verification from the same old-school media they whine about.

Guy didn't respond to an email sent Monday afternoon but shared an article from HuffPost on Monday about the attention, writing, “honestly, didn't expect this is what would happen when i joined a menswear forum 15 years ago.” 

I shared my story because I think the narrative about undocumented immigrants has become very slanted in order to justify crackdowns. It doesn't help when people think that all undocumented immigrants are criminals who hate the US. The ones I know are good, hardworking people. pic.twitter.com/MvZQcrls2a

— derek guy (@dieworkwear) June 9, 2025



The average undocumented immigrant is pretty similar to the average citizen: they dream of getting a better job, they value family, they enjoy social time with friends,” Guy wrote. “Like most people, they have wishy washy political views and aren't ideologues. They hide from view for obvious reasons. And thus, their part of this story isn't being told.”

“What you see on TV or social media is a slice designed to justify draconian policies,” he concluded.

Time is running of to find the right gifts for your dad this Father's Day. the big day is this weekend. If you've been letting the days get away from you and still have some gift shopping to wrap up, consider this. This deal on the Anker 622 magnetic battery could be your saving grace. If your fathers has an iPhone that supports magnetic wireless charging, the charging stand is down 35% right now so you can scoop it up for just $31.

Anker is really firing on all cylinders with this one. This is a part-external phone battery, part-phone stand. Your phone, so long as you have an iPhone 12 or later or an Android with magnetic wireless charging support, this phone battery simple snaps onto the back of your phone and can be taken with you to give you that extra charge when you need it most.

See at Amazon

The pocket-sized power bank just locks into place and you can forget it's there. What's especially nice is it doesn't block the camera lenses at all so there is no need to remove the charger when taking photos or videos.

The magnet ensures it stays perfectly aligned to provide an efficient charge and can really extend the battery life of your phone. The phone charger has a 5,000mAh cell capacity. That equates to nearly an entire iPhone 13s or iPhone 13 Pros charges. That's hours more battery life than without.

 June 10, 2025  

MANCHESTER — Mavacamten (Camzyos, Bristol Myers Squibb) continues to show promising results in patients with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM), a consultant cardiologist said at the recent British Cardiovascular Society Annual Conference 2025.

William Jenkins, a consultant cardiologist at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, said that real world outcomes mirror those from clinical trials, including EXPLORER and VALOR-HCM.

Notably, data from three UK centres showed that about 70%-80% of patients experienced symptomatic improvement with mavacamten treatment. In addition, 90% saw a 30 mm Hg drop in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient — considered a significant reduction in obstruction.

Although patients initially required “very intense echocardiographic surveillance,” Jenkins said “it gets much easier” after the first few months of treatment. 

“I think our reliance upon echocardiography will probably reduce as we get more experience with this,” he told Medscape News UK.

Mavacamten, a cardiac myosin inhibitor, is the first drug of its kind. It works by normalising contractility, reducing dynamic LVOT obstruction, and improving cardiac filling pressures in people with HCM. 

“HCM is something that develops over decades,” Jenkins said. “You can develop symptoms early, but you can have those symptoms for a really long time before you go on to develop other things like abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure, or dying suddenly.”

He added that, although oHCM is considered rare, many patients could benefit from treatment.

Managing HCM still falls within general cardiology in some centres, Jenkins noted, raising concerns that patients may not be reviewed as frequently as needed.

“People live with it for years and years — if not decades — before they develop any of the end stage features of HCM,” Jenkins said. “They can become very adapted to their symptoms.” 

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy affects around 1 in 500 people in the UK and US, with about two thirds of cases involving obstruction. 

Katharine McIntosh, head of research and policy at Cardiomyopathy UK, told Medscape News UK that mavacamten had been a “cause for excitement” among patients. “It's the first big cardiomyopathy-specific drug.”

McIntosh expressed frustration at the slow rollout of the drug, which was recommended for National Health Service use in England and Wales in 2023 and in Scotland in 2024.

“It's at the point now where one would have thought that everyone who should be on it would be getting onto it. But that's just not been the case,” she said. 

A recent Cardiomyopathy UK survey found that patients who accessed mavacamten were “very positive” about its effects. Respondents described it as “life changing” and felt like they had been given their lives back, McIntosh said.

One barrier is that mavacamten must be prescribed and monitored by specialists experienced in treating cardiomyopathies — resources not available at all centres. 

Prescribing guidance states that patients require echocardiography before and at regular intervals after starting treatment. Genetic testing for Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 (CYP2C19) is also needed to guide dosing. 

Jenkins said that three key issues must be considered before prescribing mavacamten:

“Most people tolerate this [drug] very well,” he said. After the initial 12-week period, follow-up can be reduced to every 3-6 months.

“This is an indefinite medication for a lot of people,” Jenkins said. However, with an estimated annual cost of almost £14,000 per patient, he stressed the need for careful initial use.

“Right now, the indication is for symptomatic, severe LVOT obstruction,” he said. However, “there's no reason in the long-term why this shouldn't become first-line.”

Whether mavacamten offers benefit for HCM patients without obstruction remains unclear.

Jenkins has acted as a consultant to BMS and AstraZeneca. McIntosh had no conflicts of interest to disclose.

 June 10, 2025  

Patients with Parkinson's disease rarely present to the clinic with the textbook signs — forward stooped posture, slow and rigid movements, or shuffling gait. Instead, the earliest indicators are often vague and nonspecific, though they can later be recognized as early warning signs in retrospect.

By the time the first clear symptoms appear, nearly 50% of dopaminergic neurons are irreversibly lost. The resulting dopamine deficiency disrupts the motor system, leading to hallmark symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, akinesia, and postural instability (TRAP). Diagnosis is clinical, supported by characteristic signs, and often confirmed with imaging (eg, dopamine transporter scan [DaT SCAN]). Onset is usually gradual and progressive, and symptoms may present asymmetrically.

Although Parkinson's disease remains incurable, identifying these early signs before the onset of classic motor symptoms can enable timely monitoring and potential early intervention. The earlier the disease is detected, the better its progression may be slowed. Some symptoms may manifest years in advance.

Below is an overview of early and prodromal Parkinson's symptoms. While most clinicians routinely ask about sleep or gastrointestinal function, the following list may help prompt more targeted follow-up when suspicion arises.

Sleep disturbances are often mentioned as early Parkinson's symptoms, but the specific disorder — REM sleep behavior disorder — is frequently overlooked. Unlike insomnia or sleep maintenance issues, RBD involves vivid dreaming accompanied by physical movements, such as shouting, punching, or kicking during sleep, often affecting the sleep partner.

RBD occurs in about 0.5%-1% of the population, rising to 5% in those older than 60 years. Importantly, it is considered a prodromal condition for Parkinson's: 80% of those affected may go on to develop the disease within 15 years. Patients reporting these symptoms should be monitored regularly for neurologic changes.

In clinical history-taking, ask specifically about vivid dreams, violent movements during sleep, or vocalizations. Though often dismissed as quirky or anecdotal, recurring incidents should raise red flags.

Parkinson's doesn't begin with tremors or slowed movement. Nonmotor symptoms, especially gastrointestinal issues, often appear first. The disease affects the autonomic nervous system, including the enteric nervous system that regulates bowel motility.

There is evidence that pathological changes — such as alpha-synuclein accumulation — begin in the gut and olfactory bulb before affecting the brain, aligning with the Braak hypothesis. These protein aggregates can cause constipation or olfactory dysfunction long before motor symptoms emerge.

Studies suggest chronic constipation can precede a Parkinson's diagnosis by 10-20 years. Up to 75% of patients with Parkinson's experience it. While constipation alone is nonspecific, it gains significance when combined with other prodromal signs.

Constipation should raise concern in these contexts:

Loss of smell, either partial (hyposmia) or total (anosmia), is another early and often unnoticed sign. Patients may have difficulty detecting even strong odors like coffee, bananas, or pickles.

In Parkinson's, misfolded alpha-synuclein protein aggregates disrupt brain regions, including those responsible for olfaction. These changes may impair neuron function and contribute to early sensory loss.

Animal studies suggest alpha-synuclein may behave like a prion — spreading through neural pathways. Trials are ongoing to determine whether monoclonal antibodies such as prasinezumab could help degrade these protein aggregates.

As Parkinson's disrupts dopamine pathways, it impairs fine motor control. Writing — a highly complex motor task — often becomes affected. Reduced movement amplitude can lead to smaller, cramped handwriting known as micrographia.

Micrographia is a typical, though not universal, early motor sign and may precede other motor symptoms. It often appears alongside other signs like a softer, monotone voice or reduced arm swing while walking — both early signs of extrapyramidal dysfunction.

Parkinson's is commonly associated with:

Postural instability is now recognized as a cardinal sign in the TRAP framework. Damage to extrapyramidal reflexes means patients may be unable to catch themselves when off balance.

None of these symptoms alone confirm Parkinson's disease, as many are nonspecific or seen in other conditions. However, the presence of multiple early signs — especially the combination of REM sleep behavior disorder, olfactory loss, constipation, or family history — should prompt further evaluation.

Referral should ideally be made to a neurologist specializing in movement disorders. A thorough neurologic exam, smell testing, sleep studies (polysomnography), and imaging (eg, DaT SCAN) may be warranted.

Diagnosis

Identifying these signs early and recognizing meaningful combinations — not isolated symptoms — can help clinicians initiate earlier referral and intervention, potentially altering the disease trajectory.

 June 10, 2025  

Japanese researchers have developed artificial blood, marking a significant step in this long-standing scientific pursuit. However, large-scale production remains a challenge. In France, the national blood service Établissement français du sang regularly raises alarms over critically low blood supplies, with daily donations falling short of the 10,000 units needed to meet transfusion demands. This challenge is further complicated by ABO/Rh compatibility issues, prompting targeted appeals for rare blood-type donors. This shortage is not unique to France. It is a global concern, often even more severe elsewhere, driving continued efforts to create viable artificial alternatives.

Researchers at Nara University in Nara, Japan, have created “hemoglobin vesicles” (HbVs): Haemoglobin encapsulated within a lipid shell that mimics red blood cells. In a 2022 trial, investigators injected 100 mL of HbVs into 12 healthy volunteers, with no serious adverse events reported.

The team plans to administer up to 400 mL to a larger cohort. If safety is confirmed, future studies will assess haemodynamic and respiratory effectiveness. Investigators hope to achieve industrial production and clinical use by 2030.

Artificial blood offers two key advantages over donor blood. First, it can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 years or up to 5 years if frozen, whereas donated blood expires after 6 weeks. Second, HbVs lack ABO and Rh antigens, making them theoretically compatible with all recipients. Notably, the solution turned purple.

The quest for artificial blood holds great promise as tens of thousands die annually from blood shortages, particularly in low-income countries. However, previous efforts have been repeatedly stalled. In 2011, Luc Douay, MD, PhD, senior study author and professor of Haematology at Université Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris, France, performed France's first transfusion using stem cell-derived red cells. In Japan, military physicians transfused experimental blood into rabbits in 2019 and reported encouraging results from stem cell-derived erythrocyte injections in the United Kingdom in 2022. 

“All attempts have failed so far,” Douay said in 2017. While the latest Japanese trials offer renewed hope, experts emphasise the need to expand natural blood donation programs.

IVD is a key enzyme in leucine catabolism, catalyzing the conversion of isovaleryl-CoA to 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA. Defects in IVD function lead to toxic accumulation of metabolites such as isovaleric acid, resulting in isovaleric acidemia (IVA)-a life-threatening autosomal recessive disorder characterized by vomiting, metabolic acidosis, and neurological damage. Although IVD gene mutations are known to cause IVA, the enzyme's structural dynamics and complex substrate-binding mechanisms have long hindered precise mechanistic studies.

By optimizing protein purification protocols, the team obtained cryo-EM structures of IVD in apo state and in complex with substrates (isovaleryl-CoA and butyryl-CoA) at high resolutions. The structures revealed that human IVD exists as a tetramer, with each monomer forming a unique ""U-shaped"" substrate channel composed of α-helical and β-sheet domains. This architecture enables selective recognition of short-branched chain substrates while excluding longer chains due to steric hindrance.

Further analysis highlighted IVD's distinct substrate selectivity within the ACAD family of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Unlike ACADM (which processes straight-chain C6-C12 substrates), IVD exhibits two defining features: preference for shorter branched-chain substrates (C4-C6). Structural comparisons between IVD and ACADM revealed critical differences in their active pockets. In IVD, residues L127 and L290 form a narrowed side-chain distance (compared to T121 and V284 in ACADM), creating spatial constraints that exclude substrates longer than C7 via a ""bottleneck effect"". Conversely, ACADM's Y400 and E401 residues restrict lateral flexibility with bulky side chains, while IVD's G406 and A407 reduce steric hindrance, enabling accommodation of branched chains.

The study identified glutamate residue E286 as the catalytic core, facilitating α-hydrogen abstraction, while the FAD cofactor stabilizes the tetramer through hydrogen bonds with T200, R312, and E411. Disease-associated mutations (e.g., A314V, E411K) disrupt FAD binding or distort the substrate pocket, reducing enzymatic activity by over 80%. For example, the E411K mutation replaces negatively charged glutamate with lysine, destabilizing FAD binding and tetramer integrity. These atomic-level insights clarify genotype-phenotype correlations, improving diagnostic accuracy and prognostic predictions.

The resolved structures provide a foundation for developing small-molecule therapeutics targeting the FAD-binding region or substrate pocket to stabilize mutant IVD and restore partial function. Additionally, the established ""mutation-structure-function"" framework enhances precision in IVA diagnosis and personalized treatment planning. This study not only advances our understanding of IVD's structural biology but also opens avenues for tackling this rare metabolic disorder.

Creatine, the supplement popular with athletes for its ability to help build strength and power, is increasingly being recognized for its broad health benefits.

The compound's usefulness extends well beyond the gym, according to Dr. Richard Kreider, professor and director of the Exercise & Sport Nutrition Lab at Texas A&M University. Kreider has spent more than 30 years investigating the effects of creatine, a naturally occurring compound stored in the muscle that combines with phosphate to form creatine phosphate, which is needed for cellular energy.

When the body is stressed, like in exercise or under metabolic conditions like some diseases, creatine phosphate is needed to maintain energy in the cell, and therefore has a lot of protective and health benefits, in addition to the exercise performance effects that have been seen.""

Dr. Richard Kreider, professor and director of the Exercise & Sport Nutrition Lab, Texas A&M University

Our bodies create about a gram per day, but it's recommended to get two to four grams of creatine per day, depending on muscle mass and activity levels. According to Kreider, most people fall short of getting enough creatine from diet alone. The best sources of creatine in the diet are meat and fish.

""You only get about a gram of creatine per pound of red meat or fish, like salmon, so it's expensive and takes a lot of calories to get a gram,"" Kreider said. This is why supplementation matters, especially for vegetarians or vegans who do not consume enough creatine in their diet.

For athletes with performance-related goals, Kreider said it's recommended to supplement 5 grams, four times a day for a week. Supplementation ""helps load the muscle up with more energy,"" which makes for improved high-intensity exercise, recovery and even cognitive function. After that, consuming 5 to 10 grams per day will maintain creatine stores and provide enough creatine for the brain.

Beyond boosting athletic performance, creatine is important for everyone as they age throughout their lives, Kreider said. It can help older adults who lose muscle mass and cognitive function as they age, he said, and in adolescents, low dietary creatine intake is associated with slower growth, less muscle mass and higher body fat.

In a comprehensive review published in February in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition, Kreider and colleagues analyzed 685 clinical trials on creatine supplementation to assess its safety and the frequency of reported side effects. The analysis showed there were no significant differences in the rate of side effects for participants taking a placebo and those taking creatine.

As for anecdotal concerns like bloating or cramping, Kreider says those claims don't hold up under scrutiny, and studies have shown creatine can actually prevent cramping because it helps the body retain more fluid.

Despite the strong evidence base, Kreider said creatine has long been the subject of misconceptions and misinformation. He's among the members of the International Society of Sports Nutrition who recently issued a letter affirming the safety and efficacy of creatine, urging lobbyists and policymakers not to restrict access to it.

""There's absolutely no data supporting any negative side effect anecdotally reported about creatine on the internet and in the media,"" he said. ""Creatine is safe, and it's important for everybody, not just bodybuilders and athletes.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","U.S. Soccer committee to evaluate college system","https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45485632/us-soccer-new-committee-evaluate-ncaa-soccer-future","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 18:13:00 GMT","

U.S. Soccer announced on Tuesday a committee that will evaluate and potentially overhaul the college soccer system.

The committee includes 18 members spanning stakeholders across the industry, from professional leagues and college soccer to the men's and women's games. They will recommend potential changes to college soccer - long viewed as an important but flawed development pipeline for the U.S. professional leagues - that could be implemented as early as next year.

""College soccer is integral to the fabric and future of our sport in this country,"" U.S. Soccer CEO JT Batson said in a statement. ""The individuals joining this group bring unique perspectives and expertise that will help us build a model where college soccer can thrive in a modern, connected system -- all working collaboratively in service to soccer.""

News of the committee's formation comes at a transformative and uncertain time for college sports at large.

Last week, a federal judge approved the terms of a $2.8 billion settlement that paved the way for colleges to pay student-athletes, a ruling that experts say will change college sports forever.

U.S. Soccer's committee, called the ""NextGen College Soccer Committee,"" will be chaired by Dan Helfrich, principal at Deloitte Consulting and part of U.S. Soccer's leadership advisory group.

Others involved from the professional game include Seattle Sounders and Seattle Reign co-owner Adrian Hanauer, Kansas City Current co-owner Angie Long, and executives from MLS, the NWSL and USL.

Representatives of top college programs are on the committee, as is Richard Motzkin, an executive at the player talent agency Wasserman.

The group is tasked with making recommendations for college soccer ""to thrive in the rapidly evolving soccer ecosystem,"" prior to the start of the academic year in the coming months and working with conferences and college programs ""interested in these innovative solutions and opportunities.""

Changes to the college soccer system could be implemented beginning in the 2026-27 academic year. Critics of college soccer include prominent coaches and administrators within the game. They argue that the college game has not kept pace with modern soccer and fails to prepare players to be professionals.

The college game utilizes slightly different rules like clock stoppages and unlimited substitutions. But critics' biggest point of contention is the short fall season that crams a couple dozen games into a few months.

A proposal to shift soccer from a fall sport to one that spans the full academic year -- fall to spring with a winter break -- dates back 25 years and picked up renewed momentum in 2022.

University of Maryland men's soccer coach Sasho Cirovski led a group of Division 1 soccer coaches and executives interested in implementing what they called the ""21st Century Model.""

The college game remains a particularly important pipeline in the women's game. U.S. Soccer said in Tuesday's news release that ""the group's work will consider both the men's and women's college games, recognizing that the models and solutions may differ between the two.""

U.S. Soccer formal involvement with college soccer is new.

The NextGen College Soccer Committee will also evaluate commercial opportunities for college soccer, which is of increasing importance in the NIL (name, image, likeness) era of college sports where athletes can be paid.

The federation said it would engage the NCAA and the USOPC for feedback. U.S. Soccer said it will begin outreach to college programs and conferences to gauge interest ""in participating in the new opportunities or model(s).""

There are more than 50,000 college soccer players combined in men's and women's soccer across all three divisions.

There is an increasing number of female players bypassing college to turn professional as teenagers, but that pathway remains the exception rather than the rule.

U.S. Soccer's announcement of a committee to evaluate college soccer comes as professional league attempt to figure out their own solutions.

MLS has MLS Next Pro for reserve teams, and USL has a formal academy system with its teams.

The NWSL recently announced vague plans to launch a second division for reserve teams as early as next year. U.S. Soccer said it would work its pre-professional youth members to consider their roles in potential solutions.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Diego Luna woke up in a daze, unaware of his newfound US men's national team cult-hero status.

Real Salt Lake's star midfielder had just gotten out of surgery to repair a broken nose sustained during a 3-0 friendly win over Costa Rica in January – a defining performance that was equal parts guts and talent, with the 21-year-old sporting gauze to stop the bleeding while he assisted Brian White's opening strike at Inter&Co Stadium.

“My family was there and my agents, and they were calling me ‘Big Balls' and all this stuff,” Luna said in Off The Ball, the league's new video feature series.

“It was hilarious. I thought my robe was showing or something.”

Little did Luna know, the moniker came from none other than USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino, who famously praised the 2024 MLS Young Player of the Year's proverbial testicular fortitude during a memorable post-game interview.

“He meant that I was determined to play for my country, fighting through things and stuff like that,” Luna said. “It was super cool and I think it might've been the best decision of my life to continue to play with a broken nose, right?

“'Cause it's shown people a side of me and it's opened doors.”

Luna, who will look to open more doors at this summer's 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup with the USMNT, discussed his rising profile, focus on mental health and love of body art – all while getting a new tattoo – in the premiere episode of Off The Ball.

The 2026 World Cup is what is technically known as the Proper World Cup, for national teams. This summer's tournament is the Club World Cup, featuring some (with the emphasis on “some”) of the world's best domestic teams – Real Madrid, PSG, River Plate and the like.

It did! Manchester City are technically the holders. But if there's one thing Fifa likes, it's grossly expanded tournaments and the Club World Cup is no exception. Since the tournament started in 2000, it usually featured six or seven teams representing Fifa's various confederations. The teams would turn up, play a few knockout games in half-full stadiums – and the whole thing would be done in around 10 days with very few people remembering who actually won the thing by the time next year's edition came around.

Naturally, Fifa decided fans wanted even more of this type of thing and have expanded the tournament: 32 teams will now play 63 games in 11 host cities across the United States over a period of four weeks. Like the most recent World Cup, there will be a group stage with the best two teams from each of the eight groups progressing to the last-16 knockout stage.

Well … not exactly. With all due respect to Asia, Africa, North America, Central America, the Caribbean and Oceania, the 32 best club teams on Earth are almost certainly in Europe and South America. But this is a World Cup, so the teams are mainly made up of clubs who have won their respective continental championships over the last four years (so, for example, recent winners of the Champions League get in from Europe).

There are more places for teams from stronger federations such as Europe's Uefa (12 slots) and South America's Conmebol (six slots) than weaker federations (Oceania's OFC gets just one). There are some oddities to the qualifying process though. The US got an extra slot as tournament hosts, meaning their domestic champion from 2024 would qualify. Most fans would say that would be the MLS Cup champion, which is decided after a post-season playoff competition (the 2024 champion was Los Angeles Galaxy). Instead, Fifa decided the team with the best regular-season record would qualify. That just happened to be Inter Miami, led by Lionel Messi, the most famous player in the world. Make of that what you will.

Another MLS team made it in slightly circuitous fashion. Fifa rules mean that two clubs with the same ownership can't compete at the tournament. That meant Club Léon were deprived of their slot because another Mexican team at the tournament, Pachuca, are under the same ownership group. That led to a playoff between Los Angeles FC and Club América to decide Léon's replacement, with LAFC winning.

And then there is Auckland City. The best two teams in New Zealand, Auckland FC and Wellington Phoenix, play in Australia's A-League, which is part of the Asian Football Confederation. That means Auckland City, as the winner of the OFC Champions League, grabbed the one slot for Oceania.

Playing in the World Cup is the highlight of any player's career. Playing in the Club World Cup? Not so much. Fifpro, the global players' union, said adding another month to an already crowded calendar is a health risk. Consider this: a top player in Europe will face having almost no rest in the summer for three consecutive years if they end up playing at Euro 2024, the 2025 Club World Cup and the 2026 World Cup. Oh, and the latter two tournaments will be played in the hottest months in the US as global heating makes conditions a lot tougher.

Quite a lot. The total prize pool for the tournament is $1bn. Yes, with a B. Just over half of that total goes to the clubs just for being there, and different teams have received differently-sized payouts for their participation, depending on where they hail from.

Oceania's representative gets $3.58m just for showing up. African, Asian, and North American clubs $9.55m. South American sides get $15.21m, while European teams will get anywhere from $12.81m to $38.19m, depending on what Fifa calls “sporting and commercial criteria” (in other words: how famous and good they are).

The remaining $425m is distributed based on performance in the tournament. Teams earn $2m for a win and $1m for a draw in the group stage, $7.5m for making the round of 16, $13.1m for making a quarter-final, $21m for making a semi-final, $30m for making the final, and another $40m for winning the whole dang thing.

It should be noted that the prize money mentioned above is awarded to the teams, not the players. Different teams will distribute the winnings to players differently according to a number of factors, but that doesn't mean players are happy with that arrangement. In MLS, there is an ongoing dispute between the players and the league over a cap on bonuses that would limit each MLS locker room from receiving more than $1m for the tournament, no matter how well they do. The two sides are currently trading proposals, but the tenor of negotiations hasn't been all that friendly.

Manchester City, for their part, has been public about not sharing prizes with their players: “Not even a watch,” said Pep Guardiola.

Many see this tournament as a test run for the US's co-hosting of next year's World Cup, and the results are already … mixed. Donald Trump has issued a travel ban relating to citizens of a number of countries. Athletes participating in the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Los Angeles Olympics are exempt from the ban, but it's still unclear whether that applies to players at the Club World Cup. Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, met Trump in the White House in March when they unveiled the new Club World Cup trophy. Trump could completely ignore the tournament, decide to use it as an excuse for self-promotion – as he has with other sports events such as the Super Bowl – or turn on Fifa for a perceived slight. Say one thing for the man: he's not easy to predict.

Rose Bowl – Pasadena, California (Capacity: 88,500). Will host group stage and last-16 matches. Historic stadium that is renowned for hosting many college (gridiron) football games and the 1994 and 1999 World Cup finals.

MetLife Stadium – East Rutherford, New Jersey (Capacity: 82,500). Will host group stage matches, quarter-final, both semi-finals and final. This is the everyday home of the NFL's New York Giants and Jets, and will be hosting the 2026 World Cup final.

Mercedes-Benz Stadium – Atlanta, Georgia (Capacity: 75,000). Will host group-stage and last-16 matches as well as a quarter-final. The everyday home of the NFL's Atlanta Falcons and Atlanta United of MLS.

Bank of America Stadium – Charlotte, North Carolina (Capacity: 75,000). Will host group-stage and last-16 matches. The usual home of the NFL's Carolina Panthers and Charlotte FC of MLS.

Lincoln Financial Field – Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Capacity: 69,000). Will host group-stage and last-16 matches as well as a quarter-final. The usual home of the Philalphia Eagles of the NFL.

Lumen Field – Seattle, Washington (Capacity: 69,000). Will host group-stage matches. The usual home for the NFL's Seattle Seahawks, MLS's Seattle Sounders, and the NWSL's Reign FC.

Hard Rock Stadium – Miami Gardens, Florida (Capacity: 65,000). Will host group-stage and last-16 matches. The usual home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins.

Camping World Stadium – Orlando, Florida (Capacity: 65,000). Will host group-stage and last-16 matches as well as a quarter-final. Formerly known as the Citrus Bowl, it's hosted a number of major college gridiron football and in a previous live, games during the 1994 World Cup.

Geodis Park – Nashville, Tennessee (Capacity: 30,000). Group-stage matches. This is the home stadium of MLS side Nashville SC, opened in 2022.

TQL Stadium – Cincinnati, Ohio (Capacity: 26,000). Group-stage matches. This is the home stadium of MLS side FC Cincinnati, opened in 2021.

Inter&Co Stadium – Orlando, Florida (Capacity: 25,000). Group-stage matches. The home venue for MLS side Orlando City, opened in 2017.

Audi Field – Washington, D.C. (Capacity: 20,000). Group-stage matches. The home venue of MLS side DC United, opened in 2018.

The early signs are not great. Consider the tournament's opening match, between Inter Miami and Al Alhy. Miami are playing in their own city and have one of the greatest players of all time, and yet the match is struggling to sell out with The Athletic reporting that only around 20,000 tickets for the 65,000 capacity Hard Rock Stadium have been sold. If Miami are struggling to sell tickets then it's worth wondering how many people are going to turn up for Wydad v Al Ain. Having said that, there is huge interest in European giants such as Real Madrid and Chelsea and their games should attract big crowds.

Kylian Mbappé, Real Madrid – Heard of him? The French superstar is facing some degree of questioning after his first season in the Spanish capital ended with no major titles. Would a Club World Cup alleviate those doubts?

Ousmane Dembélé, PSG – The forward was instrumental in helping PSG capture their coveted Champions League title in May, and he'll presumably continue to be centre to the European champions' plans in the USA.

Lionel Messi, Inter Miami – The Argentinian superstar has a World Cup to his name…can he add a Club World Cup to that list? Realistically, it may be a tough ask with this Miami team, even with the help of Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets, and Luis Suárez. But it'll be fun to watch him in a tournament setting again.

Omar Marmoush, Manchester City – The Egyptian made a big impact since joining City in January from Eintracht Frankfurt, scoring eight goals in all competitions including a memorable thunderbolt v Bournemouth.

Cole Palmer, Chelsea – Palmer ended his season in great form, even though his overall campaign left something to be desired. The England international leads a Chelsea team stocked with young talent.

Denis Bouanga, LAFC – The Gabon international near-singlehandedly dragged LAFC into the tournament with a sublime performance in the one-game play-in versus Club América. Bouanga has long been one of MLS's most dangerous attackers, and it will be interesting to see him bring it against international competition.

Franco Mastantuono, River Plate (for now) – The 17-year-old Mastantuono is seen as one of the brightest up-and-coming talents in Argentina, so much so that he became the youngest-ever debutant for the Argentine national team last week. Real Madrid and River Plate are currently locked in transfer talks according to multiple reports – the only question now is if he'll stay with his current side through the Club World Cup, or move earlier.

Thomas Müller, Bayern Munich – the 35-year-old had already bid goodbye to his home fans, but the Club World Cup will be his last competition in a Bayern Munich shirt. The wily forward will want to go out on another high note, after helping Bayern to another Bundesliga title.

Weston McKennie, Juventus – Playing in his home country for the first time in competitive club matches, there's almost no telling what role McKennie will play for Juventus. The US international has played in just about every midfield spot and even occasionally at wingback in what was a disappointing season for Juve, which they'll hope to put behind them with a solid showing.

Estêvão, Palmeiras – The 18-year-old forward, like Mastantuono, is one of his country's brightest young stars. He's already earned four senior caps for Brazil and has 13 goals with 12 assists to his name in Brazil's Serie A. He has agreed to join Chelsea in a transfer after the tournament, so this will be his last chance to make a mark before moving abroad.

So much will depend on how seriously the clubs take the tournament, and which among them are the freshest after a long European season. PSG are a decent bet, given their demolition of Inter in the Champions League final and their collection of young talent that is willing to work. Real Madrid, of course, can never be counted out in a tournament setting, and Trent Alexander-Arnold will be looking to impress in his first actions for his new club. Manchester City closed a disappointing Premier League season in great form.

Is there a chance an outside contender, like Porto, or River Plate, Boca Juniors, or Flamengo could take it? Sure. But given the other sides involved, it's hard to be all that confident.

Every game is streamed worldwide in multiple languages on Dazn. You can also follow along on the Guardian – we'll be live-blogging select games throughout the tournament and have writers on the ground all the way until the final.

In the United States, select games will be shown in English on TNT Sports and in Spanish on TUDN, Univision, or UniMas.

In the UK, Channel 5 will show a selection of games, including 16 group-stage matches, four last-16 games, two quarter-finals, one semi-final, and the final.

In Australia, every game is live on Foxtel and Kayo Sports.

Club World Cup ‘Harms La Liga': Tebas Warns of Madrid Fixture Chaos originally appeared on Athlon Sports.

The FIFA Club World Cup kicks off in days, with Inter Miami facing Al Ahly in the opener on Saturday at the Hard Rock Stadium. The event kicks off a month-long tournament with 32 clubs from around the world.

This newly formatted competition has had a mixed reaction from soccer fans around the world.

Many fans dreamed of watching the worlds top clubs face off around the world have the chance to play each other, but others find it unnecessary to bring this competition to life.

Formatted like the World Cup for national teams, the Club World Cup will provide significant prize money for the participating teams, and more will be secured depending on each team's performance.

Only two La Liga will compete in the tournament, which are the Madrid clubs Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid.

There are concerns in Spain due to the scheduling of the competition, as La Liga will soon unveil the league's schedule for next season, which starts in August. The Club World Cup will start on June 14 and end on July 13.

La Liga President Javier Tebas spoke to COPE and was asked his opinion of the Madrid clubs participating in the competition.

Tebas doesn't understand the point of having the competition other than being a financial benefit for clubs participating in it. The La Liga president mentions how it could negatively impact the league itself.

Javier Tebas: ""The Club World Cup is a complete nonsense. This model harms the ecosystem of LaLiga. And then there is the other issue, when will Real Madrid and Atlético be able to start the league matches.""

With Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid being top clubs, it is possible for them to reach the latest rounds of the Club World Cup. The quarterfinals of the competition will be played on July 4 and 5.

Anything past that date seems too late in preparation for the upcoming soccer season, which typically starts in mid-August. Along with that, rest time for players will be significantly reduced.

Tebas is remains firmly opposed to the Club World Cup and does not want to change calendar dates for the new season. He will decide whether Real Madrid and/or Atletico Madrid will rest in the first matchweek.

Javier Tebas: ""We have to see and study it. It cannot be that we are constantly changing our calendars for other competitions, FIFA expects all leagues to adapt without consulting us. A Madrid derby in the first matchday is impossible.""

Three days ago, La Liga announced that the 2025-26 season league will start on the weekend of 17th August. The performance of the Madrid teams could result in game delays.

COPE reports that the Association of Spanish Footballers (AFE) has spoken with Real Madrid's Dani Carvajal and Atletico Madrid's Koke on a potential delay in the upcoming La Liga season.

If Real Madrid and/or Atlético Madrid reach the quarterfinals of the Club World Cup, they may start their La Liga season a week after the scheduled start of the season.

It could be as late as August 24 that either or both clubs could play their first league game of the new season if they become the last eight teams of the Club World Cup this summer.

Real Madrid is in Group H with Al Hilal, Pachuca, and RB Salzburg. They will make their debut on June 18 when they take on Al Hilal at the Hard Rock Stadium.

Atletico Madrid is in Group B along with Botafogo, Seattle Sounders, and PSG. They will make their debut on Sunday, June 15, against the newly crowned European Champions, PSG.

Real Madrid have reportedly failed to get a deal done for Álvaro Carreras in time for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

The fullback is one of Los Blancos' primary transfer targets during a summer full of defensive reinforcements. With Dean Huijsen and Trent Alexander-Arnold already signed, Real Madrid were hoping to add Carreras to their new and improved backline for Xabi Alonso's first tournament in charge. 

Except The Athletic report “no agreement has been reached” between Real Madrid and Benfica despite the two clubs being in talks for the defender since May. Carreras is now expected to play for Benfica at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

The news is a blow for Alonso, who is headed to the United States without a starting left back. Ferland Mendy is set to miss the entire competition after undergoing surgery for a ruptured tendon in his right quadriceps muscle. Eduardo Camavinga, Real Madrid's emergency left back, is also sidelined for the summer as he recovers from a complete tear of the tendon in his left abductor muscle.

Alonso now will be forced to play Fran García on the left flank. Although the 25-year-old made 48 appearances for Real Madrid in the 2024–25 season, he is typically not the trusted option to go against tougher opponents in Europe. 

Real Madrid will still have the opportunity to sign Carreras, though, ahead of their 2025–26 campaign.  The 22-year-old reportedly remains keen on a move to the Spanish capital and is “awaiting the transfer agreement” in Lisbon.

To get the deal over the line, the Spanish outfit will likely have to pay Carreras's €50 million ($57 million) release clause in full. Until then, Carreras will continue to represent Benfica and will feature for the Portuguese side at this summer's FIFA Club World Cup.

LaLiga president Javier Tebas will not be cheering FIFA's Club World Cup when play begins this week.

Tebas largely has concerns over his own product because two of the 32 teams in the draw -- Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid -- play in Spain's top flight and might face delays to the start of their season should they advance to the Round of 16 in July. LaLiga is scheduled to begin on Aug. 16.

""There is already controversy over when Real Madrid and Atletico will start LaLiga, which disrupts our usual football schedule and hurts us in the medium term,"" Tebas said in a radio interview with Cadena Cope radio. ""The decision on whether Real Madrid and Atletico will start (LaLiga) later (in order to rest) is not mine alone. It will be made in due course when we see where they stand. But it can't be that we keep having to constantly change our schedule for other competitions that we are not in favor of.""

FIFA is the governing body overseeing the CWC and next year's World Cup. Tebas said he had no contact with any officials at FIFA, and they didn't consult LaLiga about any of the details of the tournament being held in the United States.

""It is completely absurd,"" Tebas said.

""They haven't consulted us about dates, they haven't consulted us about anything. What they're doing is damaging Spanish competition, if big teams like Real Madrid or Atletico can't play on the first day of LaLiga.""

FIFA Club World Cup

Summer Transfer

Window

Al Hilal are in talks to sign N'Golo Kante on a short-term loan deal from fellow Saudi Pro League side Al Ittihad for the Club World Cup.

An agreement has not yet been reached but there is optimism that a deal can be done.

Al Hilal and Al Ittihad are controlled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), which took control of both clubs, as well as Al Nassr and Al Ahli ahead of the 2023 summer transfer window.

Al Hilal are the only Saudi Arabian side at the expanded Club World Cup in the United States this summer, having qualified as the winners of the 2021 Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Champions League.

Former Inter Milan head coach Simone Inzaghi was confirmed as their new head coach last week, while their squad contains several former stars of European football including Ruben Neves, Aleksandar Mitrovic and Kante's former Chelsea team-mate Kalidou Koulibaly.

Kante, 34, joined Al Ittihad on a free transfer from Chelsea in July 2023. He has played 81 times for them and was part of the SPL title-winning team this past season, finishing eight points clear of second-placed Al Hilal.

The Frenchman joined Chelsea from Leicester City for £30million in the summer of 2016, having just played a large role in the East Midlands club winning their first-ever Premier League title. In his seven years at Chelsea, Kante was recognised as one of the best midfielders in the world and won the Premier League, Champions League, Europa League and FA Cup with the club, making 269 appearances.

Al Hilal begin their Club World Cup campaign against Real Madrid on June 18, before facing Red Bull Salzburg on June 22 and Pachuca on June 26.

Al Hilal's deal to sign N'Golo Kante on a short-term deal could collapse due to fan backlash, talkSPORT understands.

Kante is on the books for Saudi Pro League rivals Al Ittihad.

However, Al Hilal are the only Saudi side to qualify for the Club World Cup and are keen to take Kante with them.

Kante has agreed to a deal and it is now down to the clubs to finalise negotiations.

But it remains to be seen whether they will pay attention to what promises to be a furious reaction from fans in Saudi Arabia over a deal constructed between two rivals.

The expectation, should a deal be completed, is that Kante will return to Al Ittihad for the 2025/26 season.

Al-Hilal and Al Ittihad are both controlled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, while central Saudi dealmakers also see value in Kante switching clubs believing he will raise Hilal's profile during the Club World Cup.

Al Hilal begin their tournament against Real Madrid in Miami on June 18 and have been keen to add marquee names ahead of that fixture, which will also see former Inter boss Simone Inzaghi make his debut.

Al Hilal retained the central budget originally allocated for Mohamed Salah's wages had he left Liverpool, giving them over £500m to spend this summer. They are expected to be ambitious after the Club World Cup in the market as well.

The Riyadh-based club tried for Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes and Napoli striker Victor Osimhen and talkSPORT understands they even made a late call on Monday about Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.

Atlanta's Ederson, Inter's Nicola Barella and Aston Villa's Youri Tielemans were all also approached, while deals for Roma's Angelino and Milan's Theo Hernandez fell through. 

Hilal may revisit some of their these targets after the Club World Cup.

A loan move, similar to what is being proposed for N'Golo Kante, was also proposed for Cristiano Ronaldo.

However, the Portugal star was reticent to switch from Al Nassr to Al Hilal, given the city rivalry between the clubs. Ronaldo is now expected to extend at Al Nassr.

Kante is more open to a temporary switch. The 34-year-old has made 81 appearances for Al Ittiahd since leaving Chelsea in summer 2023, and won the Saudi Pro League title last season.

Should an agreement be reached on Tuesday, Kante will join Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ruben Neves and be reunited with his former Chelsea teammate Kalidou Koulibaly.

What is the Club World Cup, how can you watch it, and who is playing in it? All the key questions are answered here

The 2026 World Cup is what is technically known as the Proper World Cup, for national teams. This summer's tournament is the Club World Cup, featuring some (with the emphasis on “some”) of the world's best domestic teams – Real Madrid, PSG, River Plate and the like.

It did! Manchester City are technically the holders. But if there's one thing Fifa likes, it's grossly expanded tournaments and the Club World Cup is no exception. Since the tournament started in 2000, it usually featured six or seven teams representing Fifa's various confederations. The teams would turn up, play a few knockout games in half-full stadiums – and the whole thing would be done in around 10 days with very few people remembering who actually won the thing by the time next year's edition came around.

Naturally, Fifa decided fans wanted even more of this type of thing and have expanded the tournament: 32 teams will now play 63 games in 11 host cities across the United States over a period of four weeks. Like the most recent World Cup, there will be a group stage with the best two teams from each of the eight groups progressing to the last-16 knockout stage.

Well … not exactly. With all due respect to Asia, Africa, North America, Central America, the Caribbean and Oceania, the 32 best club teams on Earth are almost certainly in Europe and South America. But this is a World Cup, so the teams are mainly made up of clubs who have won their respective continental championships over the last four years (so, for example, recent winners of the Champions League get in from Europe).

There are more places for teams from stronger federations such as Europe's Uefa (12 slots) and South America's Conmebol (six slots) than weaker federations (Oceania's OFC gets just one). There are some oddities to the qualifying process though. The US got an extra slot as tournament hosts, meaning their domestic champion from 2024 would qualify. Most fans would say that would be the MLS Cup champion, which is decided after a post-season playoff competition (the 2024 champion was Los Angeles Galaxy). Instead, Fifa decided the team with the best regular-season record would qualify. That just happened to be Inter Miami, led by Lionel Messi, the most famous player in the world. Make of that what you will.

Another MLS team made it in slightly circuitous fashion. Fifa rules mean that two clubs with the same ownership can't compete at the tournament. That meant Club Léon were deprived of their slot because another Mexican team at the tournament, Pachuca, are under the same ownership group. That led to a playoff between Los Angeles FC and Club América to decide Léon's replacement, with LAFC winning.

And then there is Auckland City. The best two teams in New Zealand, Auckland FC and Wellington Phoenix, play in Australia's A-League, which is part of the Asian Football Confederation. That means Auckland City, as the winner of the OFC Champions League, grabbed the one slot for Oceania.

Playing in the World Cup is the highlight of any player's career. Playing in the Club World Cup? Not so much. Fifpro, the global players' union, said adding another month to an already crowded calendar is a health risk. Consider this: a top player in Europe will face having almost no rest in the summer for three consecutive years if they end up playing at Euro 2024, the 2025 Club World Cup and the 2026 World Cup. Oh, and the latter two tournaments will be played in the hottest months in the US as global heating makes conditions a lot tougher.

Quite a lot. The total prize pool for the tournament is $1bn. Yes, with a B. Just over half of that total goes to the clubs just for being there, and different teams have received differently-sized payouts for their participation, depending on where they hail from.

Oceania's representative gets $3.58m just for showing up. African, Asian, and North American clubs $9.55m. South American sides get $15.21m, while European teams will get anywhere from $12.81m to $38.19m, depending on what Fifa calls “sporting and commercial criteria” (in other words: how famous and good they are).

The remaining $425m is distributed based on performance in the tournament. Teams earn $2m for a win and $1m for a draw in the group stage, $7.5m for making the round of 16, $13.1m for making a quarter-final, $21m for making a semi-final, $30m for making the final, and another $40m for winning the whole dang thing.

It should be noted that the prize money mentioned above is awarded to the teams, not the players. Different teams will distribute the winnings to players differently according to a number of factors, but that doesn't mean players are happy with that arrangement. In MLS, there is an ongoing dispute between the players and the league over a cap on bonuses that would limit each MLS locker room from receiving more than $1m for the tournament, no matter how well they do. The two sides are currently trading proposals, but the tenor of negotiations hasn't been all that friendly.

Manchester City, for their part, has been public about not sharing prizes with their players: “Not even a watch,” said Pep Guardiola.

Many see this tournament as a test run for the US's co-hosting of next year's World Cup, and the results are already … mixed. Donald Trump has issued a travel ban relating to citizens of a number of countries. Athletes participating in the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Los Angeles Olympics are exempt from the ban, but it's still unclear whether that applies to players at the Club World Cup. Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, met Trump in the White House in March when they unveiled the new Club World Cup trophy. Trump could completely ignore the tournament, decide to use it as an excuse for self-promotion – as he has with other sports events such as the Super Bowl – or turn on Fifa for a perceived slight. Say one thing for the man: he's not easy to predict.

Rose Bowl – Pasadena, California (Capacity: 88,500). Will host group stage and last-16 matches. Historic stadium that is renowned for hosting many college (gridiron) football games and the 1994 and 1999 World Cup finals.

MetLife Stadium – East Rutherford, New Jersey (Capacity: 82,500). Will host group stage matches, quarter-final, both semi-finals and final. This is the everyday home of the NFL's New York Giants and Jets, and will be hosting the 2026 World Cup final.

Mercedes-Benz Stadium – Atlanta, Georgia (Capacity: 75,000). Will host group-stage and last-16 matches as well as a quarter-final. The everyday home of the NFL's Atlanta Falcons and Atlanta United of MLS.

Bank of America Stadium – Charlotte, North Carolina (Capacity: 75,000). Will host group-stage and last-16 matches. The usual home of the NFL's Carolina Panthers and Charlotte FC of MLS.

Lincoln Financial Field – Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Capacity: 69,000). Will host group-stage and last-16 matches as well as a quarter-final. The usual home of the Philalphia Eagles of the NFL.

Lumen Field – Seattle, Washington (Capacity: 69,000). Will host group-stage matches. The usual home for the NFL's Seattle Seahawks, MLS's Seattle Sounders, and the NWSL's Reign FC.

Hard Rock Stadium – Miami Gardens, Florida (Capacity: 65,000). Will host group-stage and last-16 matches. The usual home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins.

Camping World Stadium – Orlando, Florida (Capacity: 65,000). Will host group-stage and last-16 matches as well as a quarter-final. Formerly known as the Citrus Bowl, it's hosted a number of major college gridiron football and in a previous live, games during the 1994 World Cup.

Geodis Park – Nashville, Tennessee (Capacity: 30,000). Group-stage matches. This is the home stadium of MLS side Nashville SC, opened in 2022.

TQL Stadium – Cincinnati, Ohio (Capacity: 26,000). Group-stage matches. This is the home stadium of MLS side FC Cincinnati, opened in 2021.

Inter&Co Stadium – Orlando, Florida (Capacity: 25,000). Group-stage matches. The home venue for MLS side Orlando City, opened in 2017.

Audi Field – Washington, D.C. (Capacity: 20,000). Group-stage matches. The home venue of MLS side DC United, opened in 2018.

The early signs are not great. Consider the tournament's opening match, between Inter Miami and Al Alhy. Miami are playing in their own city and have one of the greatest players of all time, and yet the match is struggling to sell out with The Athletic reporting that only around 20,000 tickets for the 65,000 capacity Hard Rock Stadium have been sold. If Miami are struggling to sell tickets then it's worth wondering how many people are going to turn up for Wydad v Al Ain. Having said that, there is huge interest in European giants such as Real Madrid and Chelsea and their games should attract big crowds.

Kylian Mbappé, Real Madrid – Heard of him? The French superstar is facing some degree of questioning after his first season in the Spanish capital ended with no major titles. Would a Club World Cup alleviate those doubts?

Ousmane Dembélé, PSG – The forward was instrumental in helping PSG capture their coveted Champions League title in May, and he'll presumably continue to be centre to the European champions' plans in the USA.

Lionel Messi, Inter Miami – The Argentinian superstar has a World Cup to his name…can he add a Club World Cup to that list? Realistically, it may be a tough ask with this Miami team, even with the help of Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets, and Luis Suárez. But it'll be fun to watch him in a tournament setting again.

Omar Marmoush, Manchester City – The Egyptian made a big impact since joining City in January from Eintracht Frankfurt, scoring eight goals in all competitions including a memorable thunderbolt v Bournemouth.

Cole Palmer, Chelsea – Palmer ended his season in great form, even though his overall campaign left something to be desired. The England international leads a Chelsea team stocked with young talent.

Denis Bouanga, LAFC – The Gabon international near-singlehandedly dragged LAFC into the tournament with a sublime performance in the one-game play-in versus Club América. Bouanga has long been one of MLS's most dangerous attackers, and it will be interesting to see him bring it against international competition.

Franco Mastantuono, River Plate (for now) – The 17-year-old Mastantuono is seen as one of the brightest up-and-coming talents in Argentina, so much so that he became the youngest-ever debutant for the Argentine national team last week. Real Madrid and River Plate are currently locked in transfer talks according to multiple reports – the only question now is if he'll stay with his current side through the Club World Cup, or move earlier.

Thomas Müller, Bayern Munich – the 35-year-old had already bid goodbye to his home fans, but the Club World Cup will be his last competition in a Bayern Munich shirt. The wily forward will want to go out on another high note, after helping Bayern to another Bundesliga title.

Weston McKennie, Juventus – Playing in his home country for the first time in competitive club matches, there's almost no telling what role McKennie will play for Juventus. The US international has played in just about every midfield spot and even occasionally at wingback in what was a disappointing season for Juve, which they'll hope to put behind them with a solid showing.

Estêvão, Palmeiras – The 18-year-old forward, like Mastantuono, is one of his country's brightest young stars. He's already earned four senior caps for Brazil and has 13 goals with 12 assists to his name in Brazil's Serie A. He has agreed to join Chelsea in a transfer after the tournament, so this will be his last chance to make a mark before moving abroad.

So much will depend on how seriously the clubs take the tournament, and which among them are the freshest after a long European season. PSG are a decent bet, given their demolition of Inter in the Champions League final and their collection of young talent that is willing to work. Real Madrid, of course, can never be counted out in a tournament setting, and Trent Alexander-Arnold will be looking to impress in his first actions for his new club. Manchester City closed a disappointing Premier League season in great form.

Is there a chance an outside contender, like Porto, or River Plate, Boca Juniors, or Flamengo could take it? Sure. But given the other sides involved, it's hard to be all that confident.

Every game is streamed worldwide in multiple languages on Dazn. You can also follow along on the Guardian – we'll be live-blogging select games throughout the tournament and have writers on the ground all the way until the final.

In the United States, select games will be shown in English on TNT Sports and in Spanish on TUDN, Univision, or UniMas.

In the UK, Channel 5 will show a selection of games, including 16 group-stage matches, four last-16 games, two quarter-finals, one semi-final, and the final.

In Australia, every game is live on Foxtel and Kayo Sports.

World Cup

A year from now, the most expansive World Cup in history will kick off on North American soil, but you might not know it from walking through any of the 11 U.S. host cities. Any soccer-themed billboards or Instagram advertising splashes are conspicuously absent. That the World Cup is coming is no secret, but the visible signs that we're at a 12-month countdown are few and far between.

By the time the 48 qualified teams begin their campaigns in the U.S., Mexico and Canada in 2026, the chances are that this will be the most hyped sporting event North America has ever seen. Yet despite the anticipation from soccer fans, the U.S. side has remained relatively hushed so far.

So why hasn't there been more of a push? And why did the year-out marker pass by this week with so little domestic fanfare?

“It is kind of like the Club World Cup. We did not see a lot of action around it either,” Dave Wakeman of Wakeman Consulting, a strategy firm focused on sports, told The Athletic. 

There are several reasons U.S. host cities have not moved faster. For starters, many key details are still up in the air. Host cities do not know which matches they'll stage, the official draw isn't until December, and unless you are eyeing premium hospitality packages that cost thousands of dollars, tickets for the general public aren't even on sale yet.

With no significant financial help from FIFA, host cities are also juggling the responsibility of finding funds they need to use for promoting the event, multiple industry insiders told The Athletic. Add in the fact that FIFA traditionally launches its own major marketing push just six to nine months before the tournament, and the current silence starts to make more sense. Still, for an event of this scale, the absence of orchestrated buzz could be seen as risky.

“Think of it like the launching of a blockbuster movie,” Wakeman said. “You want to have an action plan that builds 90-180 days out. But you need to get going now because people have to plan. You are counting on people coming from around the world, but in the current environment, you have to rely on American tourists more than usual.”

In most cases, the slow rollout appears to be a calculated move. Unlike most countries, the U.S. is saturated with major sporting events year-round, making it harder for any single tournament — even the World Cup — to dominate the spotlight. At least that's the reason one host city, San Francisco, is making sure it is using its resources efficiently.

“A year is actually a very short time before such a big event,” Zaileen Janmohamed, the president and CEO of the Bay Area Host Committee (BAHC), told The Athletic during the World Cup Host City event in New York on Monday.

“But we have a Super Bowl right before the World Cup, so we're making sure that we're prioritizing the right decisions at the right time. First we've got America's biggest game, and then we have the world's biggest tournament.”

Starting Wednesday, many host cities will kick off their “One Year Out” activations, following San Francisco's lead. In Seattle, the countdown clock will be unveiled at the base of the Space Needle during a fan celebration featuring local soccer legends and ambassadors to drum up excitement.

Then on Sunday, which is exactly one year before Seattle hosts its first World Cup match, the host committee will team up with the Seattle Reign and Seattle Sounders to attempt a Guinness World Record for world's largest soccer clinic.

In Houston, the host committee will host an exclusive event with city officials and potential donors, featuring former USMNT captain Carlos Bocanegra. In Kansas City, the chair of the host committee board will throw out the first pitch at Wednesday night's game between the Royals and the New York Yankees to mark the one-year countdown.

Despite being thoughtful about a big marketing push later in 2026, San Francisco is also planning on kicking off the marketing campaign with a plaque unveiling at the stadium with the city of Santa Clara on Wednesday and a speaking event with some of the biggest names in soccer from the Bay Area, including San Jose Earthquakes coach Bruce Arena, Brady Stewart of Bay FC and Aly Wagner, former USWNT legend and one of the owners of Bay FC. There will also be a free, open clinic and a community festival in San Jose on Saturday for the public.

Meanwhile, in Canada and Mexico, some of their host cities are already pitching things with posters revealed in public spaces to hype soccer fans.

But perhaps one of the most bizarre ways to kick off the World Cup promotions happened a few weeks ago in New York. For the first time ever, a professional soccer freestyler, Frankie Flo, juggled and dribbled a soccer ball through the Lincoln Tunnel, which connects New Jersey and New York, to spotlight “the unifying power of sport and elevate community spirit,” according to Boden, the PR agency that promoted the event.

“The Lincoln Tunnel Challenge 5K is a perfect reflection of what FIFA World Cup 26 NYNJ is all about, connecting the two great states of NY and NJ, and the entire region through athleticism, passion, and community spirit,” a statement from Boden read.

Of all the ways to hype the biggest sporting event in history, a freestyling influencer dribbling a ball through a fume-choked tunnel every New Yorker despises was an interesting one.

It may have been an odd way to build buzz around the World Cup, but for organizers, even a weird stunt like this signals a shift from vague hype to decisions and the beginning of the final push.

“How does it feel to be one year out? Does it make it more real? Of course!” Janmohamed explained. “The good news is that the decisions start to get made instead of being in this phase where you're planning and thinking. We now have to make a decision, and that decision allows us to make other decisions. Understanding that the World Cup is coming next year, and I think it's actually going to be a really, really great tournament.”

French Open

ROLAND GARROS, PARIS — Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2) in the French Open final at Roland Garros on Sunday.

The No. 2 seed prevailed over the No. 1 seed in an intense, fast-paced match that turned into a tennis psychodrama as it stretched into its sixth hour and evening fell across the Paris clay. It was ultimately decided by Sinner's dominance on short points, Alcaraz's newfound ability to impose his variety, and one of the greatest surges of the Spaniard's young career.

The first major final between the two standout players in men's tennis enshrined this young rivalry's place in global sport, as they produced a classic that will hopefully go down as the first instalment in something epochal.

It is Alcaraz's fifth Grand Slam title and his second at the French Open. This win is also the 22-year-old's first comeback from two sets to love down in his career.

It takes their head-to-head to 8-4 in the Spaniard's favor and extends his winning streak over Sinner, 23, to five matches.

The Athletic‘s writers, Charlie Eccleshare and Matt Futterman, analyze the final and what it means for tennis.

In the fifth set, having fended off three match points, Alcaraz found himself in the position Sinner had been in the fourth: serving at 5-4 for the French Open title.

Against a physically ailing opponent, this final was surely going to get a conclusion at last. Instead, Sinner somehow found some extra reserves and took advantage of Alcaraz's nerves to break back to 15. When Sinner chased down a drop shot to earn the break points, Alcaraz hadn't even moved forward, so sure was he that he had won the point.

Court Philippe-Chatrier was stunned, and from there the match descended into a stunning psychodrama that enshrined this young sporting rivalry's place in the global sporting world. None of this had seemed possible at the start of the set, when Sinner could barely move. It was as though he was back from the dead, just as Alcaraz had raised himself from two sets down.

The match was back level and impossible to call again. Alcaraz got to deuce on Sinner's serve, but he couldn't get the break he needed, and so had to serve to stay in the match, having been serving for the title just minutes before.

Things then went supersonic. Sinner smashed a forehand at Alcaraz, but the Spaniard somehow got in the way of it with a volley for 15-0. Sinner responded and won the next two points — the second an angled half-volley to make his rival blush — to leave himself two points from the title.

How was he doing this? The same could be said of Alcaraz, who moved to 40-30 and avoided being championship point down again with a ridiculous forehand defensive shot followed by a flicked backhand winner. Even better was to come when Alcaraz, from deep behind the baseline, found the strength to rip a backhand passing shot away for a winner on the sharpest of angles.

That took the match into a tiebreak and ended a three-game drama that transposed into one of the great surges of Alcaraz's career.

Alcaraz got to an early lead with two big forehands across the court and a Sinner ball that flew long. Then he took a Sinner drop-shot grab out of the air on the full run to his right and smacked it deep into the open clay. Another forehand long from Sinner and Alcaraz was up 5-0, halfway home.

Was there another escape for the Italian? Not this time. Sinner missed a backhand before Alcaraz sizzled one down the line for a 7-0 lead. After all the tension of the previous five and a half hours, Alcaraz found his ceiling, which is unmatched in the sport and borderline unplayable. A match that had been defined by Sinner's impossible floor, obliterating the ball with enough safety that it lands well inside the lines, had been stolen away from him.

There was time for one final miracle from Alcaraz — a running forehand down the line that was too ridiculous for words. Alcaraz collapsed into the clay, a champion again.

Matthew Futterman and Charlie Eccleshare

Tennis fans will be watching tapes of five points from the 2025 French Open final 25 years from now — and not from that absurd tiebreak.

The match seemed so lost, it was almost silly to consider what might happen when Alcaraz stepped to the line to serve at 0-40, 3-5 in the fourth set. The celebration in Italy was about to explode.

Then came a long rally, the kind that Sinner was on the short end of for much of the afternoon. He went long with a ground stroke. Interesting, but he had two more championship points and then, in reserve, a chance to serve it out. Then he sent a backhand long when trying to jump on a second serve. Hmm.

On the next point, Sinner seized control, moving into the court, setting up a kill shot. But when he pulled the trigger on his forehand, it went into the net. Alcaraz had his lifeline and whipped up the crowd, promising them more tennis if they could carry him to this most unlikely rise from the abyss.

An ace and a forehand down the line to the postage stamp later, Alcaraz was alive.

Matt Futterman

Anyone might have predicted that Sinner would have the edge on short points. He has the bigger serve and induces more errors on return than most top players.

Through the first set and into the start of the second, Sinner more than doubled Alcaraz's tally on points of four shots or fewer, winning 32-14. For shots that lasted longer than four shots, Alcaraz was in the lead 23-11. Sinner's short-point edge quickly climbed to 38-14 over the first three games of the second set, when he took early command.

Those numbers provided a nice snapshot of each player's strategy. Alcaraz wanted to get into points, especially on Sinner's serve. He wanted to move the Italian across and in front of the baseline. Sinner wanted to play first-strike tennis and avoid the points where Alcaraz controls his opponent like a puppeteer.

The dichotomy on point length gave Alcaraz that opportunity, but given the effectiveness of Sinner's serve — and the laws of elite tennis, in which short points make up the majority of points played — Alcaraz's potential advantage was quickly wiped away. By the start of the third set, Alcaraz was still up in the longer points, 34-29, but Sinner's advantage in the shorter ones was at 61-48. Sinner was playing over 60 percent of the match in a game state where he held an overwhelming advantage.

Even as Alcaraz wiped out Sinner's two-set lead, Sinner's advantage in the short points held firm.

It's no coincidence that during the peak of his domination, Sinner was winning 66 percent of points on his first serve, compared with a little under 60 percent for Alcaraz. Sinner switched from a platform (feet apart) stance in his serve to a pinpoint (feet together) launch two years ago. He soon became the world No. 1, though beating Alcaraz remained a struggle. These two players are a level above the rest of the tour, evenly matched rivals in their own galaxy. But if there is one notable gulf, it is between their serves. Alcaraz needs to close it.

At the end of the match, Sinner and Alcaraz's supremacies were even. Sinner was 108-95 on the 0-4 shot points; Alcaraz was 97-84 on anything longer than that — a deficit of 13 each way erased to nothing. When it mattered, it was Alcaraz who made his edge count. In his tiebreak surge, eight of the 12 points played were five shots or longer. Alcaraz won seven of them.

Matt Futterman

Ask any player who has done it on the biggest stages in tennis. So much of beating Alcaraz lies in finding a way to snuff out the surges that he uses to steamroll an opponent, whether he's ahead or behind. Sometimes they start with a single circus-like point that ends with a miraculous passing shot on the run or a crazy chase after a lob that no one else would think about sprinting after.

On Sunday, the first surge came nearly two hours into a match that had turned into one-way traffic for Sinner, who was serving for a two-set lead at 5-3. But suddenly Alcaraz had a 0-30 lead and Court Philippe-Chatrier came alive for the first time. The fans were chanting Alcaraz's name, begging him to make this a match.

Alcaraz obliged a couple of minutes later, pulling Sinner into two longer points, the kind that were going his way for most of the afternoon. Sinner got sloppy, committing two errors, giving Alcaraz and the match a breath of life. On the changeover, he pumped his fist to the crowd, as much for himself as for them.

Then came one of his best games of the afternoon. He opened the court and twisted balls into the open space. At one hour and 55 minutes, the set was tied. It seemed like the match had turned in 10 minutes.

But Sinner got to this final by snuffing out a similar surge from Novak Djokovic — and the crowd — in the second set of their semifinal on Friday night.

On Sunday, helped along by some luck that allowed a backhand down the line to nick the outside of the white, Sinner took the second set into a tiebreak. Alcaraz reverted to the errors, some on low-percentage shots, that had been plaguing him. Soon, the Italian was up two sets to one. What had looked like a classic Alcaraz takeover had been smothered like a tiny brushfire.

It took longer to extinguish the next one, which started when Alcaraz broke Sinner in the third set for 3-1. It was a part of a four-game winning streak that Alcaraz rode to capturing the third set, and it lasted through the first half of the fourth. Alcaraz played his best tennis of the afternoon, sliding aces out of Sinner's reach and unleashing his forehand into open spaces.

But in the seventh game of the fourth set, Sinner seemed to be shutting down any ideas that this would go the distance. He slid a drop shot nearly parallel to the net to get within two points of a decisive break. He stood firm enough in the next two rallies to induce the errors from Alcaraz and looked to be on his way.

He wasn't, because Alcaraz was about to unleash maybe the biggest surge of his career. He won 13 of the next 14 points to climb from 3-5, 0-40 down to 6-5 up. Sinner pushed it to a tiebreak, but after falling 0-2 down, Alcaraz cranked out a couple of aces on his way to winning seven of the last eight points.

Everything the world needed to know about what would come unfolded while groundskeepers prepared the court for the fifth set. With Sweet Caroline cranking on the sound system, Alcaraz ran to the crowd behind the baseline with his fist in the air as Sinner remained seated on his chair, trying to figure out some way to stifle all this.

In the end, he found it, until the one last Alcaraz rise that proved impossible to quell.

Matt Futterman

If the biggest edge Sinner has on Alcaraz is the serve, the biggest edge Alcaraz has on Sinner is rhythm. It's not just the variety that Alcaraz possesses — in his drop shots and general comfort across the forecourt that the Italian is adding to his game. Alcaraz can maneuver the ball and change the cadence of a match like no other elite player. Some lower down the tour, such as Corentin Moutet and Alexander Bublik, are masters of disruption and improvization, but Alcaraz is the maestro.

So perhaps Sinner's greatest achievement on Sunday was stopping that from happening for large swathes of the match. Sinner dictated the terms of play, ensuring that the match was a contest of intense, fast, but generally metronomic rallies. Alcaraz, usually the dictating player, was left trying to get his opponent out of his rhythm and fluctuate the patterns of play.

He tried, but Sinner stayed tight to the baseline and played a match more typically seen on a hard court, the surface where Sinner is borderline unbeatable. By his own admission, it's the kind of tennis he's been playing all clay-court season, leaving defeated opponents in his wake.

For the first two sets, Sinner's consistent hitting and aggressive court position prevented Alcaraz from getting on top of the rallies and bringing his lethal drop shot regularly into play. When Alcaraz did use it, Sinner was too far forward to make it effective. By the end of the third set, Alcaraz's drop shots to points played percentage was the lowest it had been all tournament.

But as the match ticked into its fourth and fifth sets, Alcaraz took over. Alcaraz was swinging a tiring Sinner across the baseline and punishing him with inside-in drop shots.

By the end, Alcaraz had hit more drop shots than during any other match in the tournament.

Charlie Eccleshare

Sinner is often compared to Djokovic for his style of tennis, but there's something about his mentality that also resembles the 24-time Grand Slam champion.

Having been broken to love to lose the third set, he looked over to see a grinning Alcaraz with his finger to his ear. The momentum was with the Spaniard, and that gesture can be the equivalent of the emperor's thumbs down in ancient Rome. A loose Alcaraz, riding a wave of positivity and feeling the noise of the crowd, is one of the most terrifying sights in tennis.

But like Djokovic, Sinner is extremely adept at shrugging off disappointment to lock back in. He began the fourth set with renewed purpose, and though he missed a break point on Alcaraz's serve at 1-1, he was holding easily himself and keeping the pressure on his opponent.

Alcaraz, knowing one misstep would almost certainly be terminal, lost his serve to love to give Sinner a 4-3 lead with another loose game. Sinner put the rhythm of the match back on his terms, stifling his opponent's surge.

It is uncertain how much Sinner felt he had to get this done in four sets because of his lack of matches after a three-month suspension, and his poor record in long matches — he was 6-9 in five-setters and had lost all six longer than three hours and 50 minutes before this final.

Curiously, the clock ticked beyond three hours and 50 minutes while Sinner was serving for the match, which made the fact that Alcaraz had kept things competitive in the face of a second-set rout a couple of hours earlier seem significant. Alcaraz had trailed 1-4, 40-40 on his serve; had Sinner won that set 6-1 or 6-2 rather than 7-6, he would have had half an hour less in his legs.

Coco Gauff said after beating Aryna Sabalenka in Saturday's women's final that extending the first set of their match had been an important factor in her ultimately outlasting the world No. 1.

Alcaraz certainly looked fresher than Sinner in the tiebreak. This final had become a long-distance race again and it was Alcaraz who had the edge. He went down 0-2, then up 4-2, conjuring memories of the Beijing Open final last fall, when Sinner led a tiebreak 3-0 before Alcaraz won it 7-3.

Alcaraz took this tiebreak by the same scoreline and the match went into a fifth set. From there, Sinner was at the point that his sprint for the line had been designed to avoid. Again, it proved the point of no return, just much later than anybody expected.

On court

“I wanted to start with Jannik. It is amazing the level you have, congratulations for an amazing two weeks, an amazing tournament. I know the hard work you put in every day.

“You're going to be champion here many, many times. It's a privilege to share the court with you. You are a huge inspiration for the kids, and for me as well.”

He also thanked his team and family, saying: “I have the privilege to live great things with you.

“I was lucky to have a lot of friends from home, from Murcia, to support, throughout the whole two weeks. This trophy is yours as well.

“This tournament is really special, I can't wait to come here year after year. Special thank you to (tournament director) Amelie Mauresmo, congratulations as well, it's not easy to be with us.

“To Paris, you have been really important support since the first practice for the first round. You were unbelievable. I can't thank you enough. You were really important, you are in my heart and always will be.”

“First of all, Carlos, congrats. Again, an amazing performance, amazing battle. To you and your team, amazing job, I'm very happy for you, and you deserve it.

“It's easier to play than talk now. To my team, thank you so much. We tried our best today, we gave everything we had. Still an amazing tournament, even though it's very, very difficult now, but it's OK.

“It's an amazing trophy so I won't sleep very well tonight, but it's OK. Thank you to the organizers for making it such a special event. The support has been amazing these couple of weeks. You are amazing.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Women's tennis: Match scheduling a 'systemic' issue after French Open criticism","https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cm26qyy1g60o","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 19:09:12 GMT","

Portia Archer was appointed WTA CEO 12 months ago

The scheduling of women's matches is a ""systemic"" issue across top-level tennis events, says the head of the women's tour.

It comes following criticism of French Open organisers who featured no women's matches in any of the 11 prime-time night sessions on Court Philippe Chatrier this year.

WTA chief executive officer Portia Archer says she expects to meet Roland Garros tournament director Amelie Mauresmo to see how they can ""effect change"" - but said she does not believe the issue lies with any individual.

""I just think it's a missed opportunity,"" Archer told BBC Sport.

""I think the fans expect, and increasingly we'll see that they demand, that they have the opportunity to see the best tennis matches - whether they are men or women - in prime-time slots.

""I think their [TV] rights partners may very well have a role to play in this, and have something to say on behalf of fans as well.""

Since the French Open introduced night sessions in 2021, only four of those matches have been from the women's draw.

But during this year's tournament, former WTA world number one Mauresmo rejected accusations that not scheduling women's matches in the tournament's night session implies female players are not ""worthy"" of the slot.

That came after three-time major finalist Ons Jabeur said that the continuing imbalance at the French Open was ""unfortunate for women's sports in general"".

The former world number two wrote in a social media post that ""honouring one side of the sport shouldn't mean ignoring the other"".

Archer said: ""I thought Ons shared a very eloquent message.

""I think we'll have conversations with Grand Slams and various events who are operating in what we believe is a way that's different to what the fans and the public demand.

""I would encourage fans to do the same. It is something that we will continue to push for and continue to advocate for - it's in our DNA at the WTA.""

Mauresmo said the potential for women's matches - which are best-of-three sets and not best-of-five like the men's - to potentially go by ""really fast"" was the justification behind the choices.

She also said the tournament does not want to have two matches in the night session, like the Australian Open and US Open, for fear of creating late finishes.

On Mauresmo's role in the decision-making at the French Open, Archer said: ""I really don't think about it in terms of an individual [making the choice]. I think it's broader than that, I think it's more foundational and more systemic.

""I think it is an issue at other tournaments, I don't think it is an issue specific to the Grand Slams.""

On whether she will seek to discuss the issue with Mauresmo, Archer added: ""I think I'll have an opportunity to do that.

""Again, it's not something that I assign to a specific individual, so we'll be working to discuss with all the relevant parties how we can effect change in this area.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","The reason why no-one is talking about Barbora Krejcikova ahead of her Wimbledon title defence","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/opinion/the-reason-why-no-one-is-talking-about-barbora-krejcikova-ahead-of-her-wimbledon-title-defence/","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Barbora Krejcikova shocked the world by winning Wimbledon 12 months ago, but has fallen out of the spotlight since.

The Czech WTA star didn't travel to the All England Club as one of the favorites in 2024, entering the event as the 31st seed.

However, as the big names fell during the early rounds, Krejcikova was there to pick up the pieces, advancing to her maiden Wimbledon final.

There, Krejcikova beat Jasmine Paolini in three sets 6-2, 2-6, 6-4, to lift the Venus Rosewater Dish for the first time in her career.

Returning to Wimbledon in 2025, there aren't many backing the 29-year-old to defend her title.

But why is that? Well, things haven't quite gone to plan for Krejcikova recently…

Beating Paolini in the 2024 final, Krejcikova clinched her second Major title, having won Roland Garros three years earlier.

Carrying that winning momentum home with her, Krejcikova partnered up with Katerina Siniakova at the Prague Open, where they won the doubles tournament two weeks after her Wimbledon triumph.

It was there that the winning stopped for Krejcikova, as she endured a torrid end to her 2024 campaign, winning just four more matches.

Hoping to bounce back in 2025, the two-time Major winner suffered another setback when Krejcikova withdrew from the Australian Open with a back injury.

That same injury kept her sidelined for the entirety of the hard-court season, before making a return just before the French Open.

Playing her first match in 191 days, Krejcikova fell to defeat against Poland's Magda Linette in the first round of Strasbourg.

Returning to winning ways, Krejcikova won her first round match at the French Open, beating Tatjana Maria.

Her run came to an end in the second round, however, losing to Russia's Veronika Kudermetova, 0-6, 3-6.

Now scheduled to play in Queen's and Eastbourne in the lead-up to Wimbledon, Krejcikova will hope to pick up some big wins ahead of her title defence.

Given the year that she's had since winning Wimbledon in 2024, it's not hard to understand why she's being overlooked as a contender for this year's title.

The likes of Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff, and Madison Keys have all impressed in 2025 and will be tough to beat on the grass, whereas Krejcikova has played just three matches.

If the odds weren't already stacked against her, she'll have to break a seven-year curse of failed Wimbledon title defences if she wants to pick up her third Grand Slam title next month.

Serena and Venus Williams are the only two players to have defended the women's Wimbledon title this Century, doing so on multiple occasions.

However, since Serena Williams won back-to-back titles in 2015 and 2016, no player has been able to defend the sole grass-court Major.

The title has proven difficult to win and even harder to retain over recent years, as the likelihood is we will see another first-time champion in 2025.

She'll begin her grass-court preparations at the Queen's Club Championships, an event brought back onto the WTA calendar this year for the first time since 1973.

Krejcikova will kick off her Queen's campaign against Slovakia's Rebecca Sramkova in the first round on Tuesday, June 10.

NICK KYRGIOS has been axed from the BBC's coverage of Wimbledon for 2025, according to reports.

It comes after his appointment to the broadcaster's team for the event last year sparked uproar.

Roughly a year earlier, the Australian had admitted to assaulting an ex-girlfriend.

And according to The Telegraph, the outspoken star will not be part of the BBC's coverage of the Grand Slam tournament this year.

The 30-year-old had been hoping to play at the All England Club for the first time since losing the 2022 final to Novak Djokovic.

However, the tennis bad boy confirmed he would not be appearing because of a recurring injury. 

Taking to Instagram, he said: ""Just wanted to give everyone a quick update – l've hit a small setback in my recovery and unfortunately won't make it back for grass season this year.

""I know how much you've all been looking forward to seeing me out there, and I'm genuinely sorry to disappoint. 

""This is just a bump in the road though, and I'm already working hard to get back stronger than ever.

“Thank you for all your continued support – it means everything to me. See you soon!""

Kyrgios will also not take up his usual punditry role on American broadcaster ESPN.

He has worked with ESPN for the last two years during the Australian Open, joining their 2025 coverage after being eliminated in the first round.

His hiring by the BBC last year was met with criticism by senior MPs and women's campaigners.

Caroline Nokes, the women and equalities committee chair, blasted that the broadcaster should ""hang its head in shame"" for the decision.

A BBC statement at the time said: ""We are in no way condoning his cited previous actions or behaviours, on and off the court, and he is employed to share his views on tennis only. 

""He has provided similar services to other major sports broadcasters in recent months. 

""The legal process he was involved in has concluded, is well documented, and he has spoken about it publicly.""

Kyrgios admitted to assaulting ex-girlfriend, Chiara Passari, in February 2023.

However, a magistrate in Canberra, Australia, said the incident - which happened in 2021 - was “a single act of stupidity or frustration,” and spared him from getting a criminal record.

THE absence of line judges at Wimbledon will be a sad sight. 

For as long as I can remember, the men and women decked out in their Ralph Lauren outfits have been part of the furniture at the All England Club. 

Yes, they provided some mild entertainment on the court when one would call ""fault"" with plenty of extra, and unnecessary, gusto and volume that boomed around Centre Court, prompting a snigger from the fans.

Then there was the ongoing game of dodgeball they had to play when a big serve nailed a mammoth ace down the line and they had to take rapid evasive action or take a whack to the top of the head. 

And challenges provided some audience participation, excitedly joining in the clapping countdown before the inevitable ""oooh"" when the graphic showed just how close the ball was to landing in or out. 

Purely objectively, Wimbledon's decision to replace line judges with Hawk-Eye Live makes total sense. 

The accuracy and consistency of calls in real-time will speed things up, save time and should mark the end of arguments over the tight incorrect calls - well, until the technology malfunctions.

And Wimbledon's hand was somewhat forced to ditch tradition for their standing in tennis.

The Australian Open and US Open already use electronic line calling and the ATP Tour is adopting Hawk-Eye Live across all of its tournaments from 2025.

Wimbledon's refusal to comply would leave them lagging behind and exposed to the threat of needless controversy over human error.

But the impact - as is so often the case in these decisions - has ramifications further down, below the surface with very little impact on Wimbledon's Championships or the players.

It is on the line judges themselves. 

Approximately 300 officials - aged from 18 to 80 - covered more than 650 matches at Wimbledon.

A fraction travel internationally with the circuit but the vast majority of those are part-time line judges based in the UK, earning up to £180 per day to work at the prestigious tournament and their chance to play their part at Wimbledon. 

For many, they will help out at British tournaments throughout the year, spurred on by the possibility of taking to the lawns of the All England Club.

But it is understood many of those officials would be reluctant to work at the lower-level tournaments without the carrot of Wimbledon dangling in the summer. 

That in turn will put a major stumbling block in the pathway for British tennis umpires, who grind up through the ranks to reach the pinnacle of the sport.

Like football with referees, tennis needs umpires and line judges.

So the inability to call ""out"" at Wimbledon could prove to be a major ""fault"" for the future of the UK's tennis officials and therefore the state of the sport on these shores.

Jannik Sinner not only fell just one step, specifically one point, short of winning his first Roland Garros, but he also came very close to achieving a milestone that had never been done before, but at least he can take comfort in having equalled a legend like Pete Sampras. The thing is, when the Italian secured the second set of the final, he linked 11 consecutive sets in Grand Slam finals (Australian Open 2023 (3), 2024 (3), and US Open 2024 (3), Roland Garros 2025 (2)). Alcaraz broke this streak by taking the third set and then the fourth and fifth, but Sinner tied in this statistic with Sampras, who also amassed 11 consecutive sets (Wimbledon 1993 (1), US Open 1993 (3), Australian Open 1993 (3), Wimbledon 1994 (3), and Australian Open 1995 (1)).

📊 Tennis players with the most consecutive sets won in Grand Slam finals (Open Era/Men's Singles):

	That pineapple under the sea is getting pretty crowded. 


	Paramount Animation and Nickelodeon Animation on Tuesday unveiled new cast additions for their upcoming The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants movie, with Regina Hall, Sherry Cola, Arturo Castro, George Lopez and Ice Spice joining the ensemble. The four-time Grammy-nominated, multi-platinum-selling rapper will also contribute an original song to the film.




	They join returning cast members Tom Kenny (SpongeBob SquarePants), Clancy Brown (Mr. Krabs), Rodger Bumpass (Squidward), Bill Fagerbakke (Patrick), Carolyn Lawrence (Sandy), Mr. Lawrence (Plankton) and Mark Hamill (Flying Dutchman) in the feature directed Derek Drymon and written by Pam Brady and Matt Lieberman.

	Ramsey Naito, president of Paramount Animation and Nickelodeon Animation, made the cast reveal at a studio showcase at the Annecy international animation festival in France on Tuesday. The event included sneak peeks at upcoming Paramount and Nickelodeon features and series, including Chris Miller's Smurfs movie, PAW Patrol: The Dino Movie, The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem 2. 


	Drymon presented the complete first act of The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants, and Miller showed the opening 20 minutes of Smurfs, which will bow theatrically on July 18. Smurfs stars Rihanna  as Smurfette — who Miller said exhibited “a deep knowledge of Smurf lore, she knew way more than I did.” The film's voice cast includes John Goodman, James Corden, Nick Offerman, Sandra Oh, Natasha Lyonne, Amy Sedaris, Daniel Levy, Octavia Spencer, Nick Kroll, Hannah Waddingham, Alex Winter, Maya Erskine, Billie Lourd, Xolo Maridueña, Marshmello, Jimmy Kimmel and Kurt Russell.

	











	The event concluded with the premiere of two animated shorts. SpongeBob: Order Up, directed by Sean Charmatz will screen theatrically ahead of Smurfs this July. Chrome Alone 2: Lost in New Jersey, a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles short directed by Kent Seki, will premiere alongside The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants in December.

The actors and 'SmartLess' podcast hosts are launching a new mobile brand, which will focus on value.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	Can a hit podcast translate into a hit phone company? The team behind SmartLess will find out.


SmartLess hosts and creators Jason Bateman, Will Arnett and Sean Hayes are launching a new mobile phone brand called SmartLess Mobile Tuesday, betting that their success in reaching people through their phones can lead to a piece of the mobile business.




	“Our SmartLess podcast now reaches millions of listeners each month, almost all of whom listen on their phones,” said Bateman in a statement. “Extending the SmartLess brand into mobile is a logical next step.”

	It isn't entirely crazy: While the trio of Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile are the dominant players, there is a burgeoning marketplace of smaller pre-paid options, and some of those have found meaningful success. In fact Mint Mobile, which counted Ryan Reynolds as an investor and co-founder, sold to T-Mobile in a $1.3 billion deal in 2023.

	SmartLess Mobile is also working with wireless industry veterans Paul and Jeni McAleese, along with lead investor Thomvest Asset Management on the new venture. SmartLess Mobile is leveraging eSim technology, which lets users sign up or switch plans just by scanning a QR code.


	“We're not the industry, and we're not trying to outsmart you,” Hayes added. “If you own your phone, spend most of your day on Wi-Fi, and are on an unlimited data plan, moving to SmartLess Mobile could literally cut your monthly bill in half. Seriously, if your phone bill knew how often you're on Wi-Fi, it would be embarrassed.”

	











	“It's time for something to cost less,” added Arnett. “You're paying for way more data than you use, and we're pretty sure that Big Wireless isn't going to let you know that your phone isn't using their network the vast majority of the time. So, we'll say it: If you're using less, you should be spending less.


	Celebrities have been able to leverage the opportunity of direct-to-consumer to launch a number of major businesses, and Arnett, Hayes and Bateman are just the latest in a long line of stars to do so. Just last month, in fact, Hailey Bieber cut a deal to sell her Rhode brand to e.l.f. Beauty in a billion dollar acquisition.

Who is it? Why, it's 'Elemental,' with filmmaker Peter Sohn taking the reins from franchise creator Brad Bird.


							By 

	Beatrice Verhoeven


Deputy Awards Editor


	Pixar is shaking things up for Incredibles 3.


Peter Sohn (Elemental, The Good Dinosaur) will direct the third installment of the critically and commercially successful animated series.




Brad Bird wrote the screenplays for and directed the first two films in the franchise, which have earned a combined $1.8 billion at the box office. Bird is currently in the process of writing the screenplay for the threequel, which will be produced by Bird and Dana Murray (Oscar-winning Soul).

	The franchise follows married couple Bob and Helen Parr (Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter) who live in the quiet suburbs with their three children after being forced to hide their superpowers by a new government mandate. Samuel L. Jackson and Sarah Vowell are part of the main cast.

	The first Incredibles was released in 2004 and won the Academy Award for best animated film the following year. Incredibles 2 was released 14 years later, and earned $1.24 billion globally. Disney officially announced a third film at the D23 Expo event in August 2024, with Bird “developing” the new project, although no more information was given as to what capacity he would be involved. Bird's schedule seems to be the reason as to why he is not directing the third film in the franchise, given he's in pre-production on Skydance's Ray Gunn.


	Sohn and Bird have a long history of collaboration: Sohn has worked on every animated Bird film (including The Incredibles and Incredibles 2) up until this year's Ray Gunn. Bird has been a mentor to Sohn, and Sohn was specifically chosen to carry The Incredibles torch by Bird and Pixar chief creative officer Pete Docter. Sohn is a Pixar veteran, having also voiced characters in various movies for the studio, like Ratatouille, Monsters University and Lightyear. Elemental, Sohn's second movie that he directed at Pixar, was nominated for the best animation feature Oscar last year.

	











	Pixar is currently gearing up for the release of Elio on June 20. The film stars Yonas Kibreab, Zoe SaldaSaldañaa and Jameela Jamil, and was directed by Madeline Sharafian and Domee Shi.

Billboard joined Peggy backstage at Gov Ball, where he shared his thoughts on politics, fame and why rap fans ""don't wanna hear Drake complain about b—hes anymore.""


													By
												

	Mackenzie Cummings-Grady



	During JPEGMAFIA‘s rambunctious set at this year's Governor's Ball, I watched as a young teenager stumbled out of the crowd, caked in sweat and mud. His glasses were fogged up, tilted at an angle across the pointed frame of his nose. He correcte them and looked at me and my friend I brought along for the day.

	“Do NOT go in there,” he exclaimed, his face radiating the sort of joy that made me think he probably wanted me to ignore this warning.

	By “there,” the young teen meant the mosh pit that had inevitably formed in the middle of the audience, a staple of every JPEGMAFIA show. As Peggy's set continued, I watched as young person after young person entered and exited the crowd in a dusty, sweaty and (in one case) bloody haze, all emanating the same joy. It was as if Peggy's mosh pit was a sort of exfoliant, revealing a newfound aliveness underneath those daring enough to try it out.


	This is the magic of JPEGMAFIA. Growing up, he was a ubiquitous presence in Baltimore's punk scene, and in turn has constantly toed the line between rap and hardcore. His latest two albums, 2024's I Lay Down My Life for You and 2023's Scaring the Hoes with Danny Brown are the closest Peggy's ever come to completely shattering that genre matrix. Both projects flip from jazz to metal to rap to punk to house to everything else so frenetically it can be nauseating — but like that notorious mosh pit, to embark upon these journeys leaves you fully awake by the end. You realize just how deep the rabbit hole goes in terms of how music can be deconstructed and reconstructed. In the world of JPEGMAFIA, there are no boundaries.

	











	“There's no f—king rules, especially not in the music industry,” Peggy told me at his trailer just a few hours before his show. He's sitting in front of a full length mirror, tackling his skincare routine. “Everything is f—king made up. All the contracts say we own you in all universes and then these n—as never been to Mars. They're just saying s—t. You get me? They're just saying s—t, I'm just saying s—t.”


	I spoke with JPEGMAFIA about the Director's Cut of his latest album, his haters, his thoughts on the state of rap and how it feels to be labeled an underground rapper while shooting for superstardom.


What inspired you to take a Directors Cut approach to I Lay Down My Life For You?


	I looked up the word directors cut after I saw that Justice League, whatever, Snyder Directors Cut s—t, and I was like s—t, we need a directors cut in music. Because I do direct all these albums. I produce them, I mix them, all that s—t. So I was like, what can I do other than call it a deluxe? Cause you either do that for some old s—t or it's just being lazy. So the deluxe or the directors cut for me was I just put the original album out. Cause I cut the fat off of it, so I put the original one back out. I love it and I got inspired from SZA cause she did Lana and she put a whole f—king new album at the front of that b—h and I'm just like, “Oh I didn't know you could do that.”


Why choose these songs to be on the Directors Cut?


	I've had ‘em around for so long I was like, “OK, these still go. I still like these…” So I put “Protect the Cross” and all that other s—t out.


“Protect the Cross” goes hard.


	Oh, they hated that s—t. They was hating hard.

	











You have one lyric on “Protect The Cross” I really wanna touch on where you say: “2025, your politics is a gang sign.” Tell me more about your thoughts on politics at this moment, and how that bar came together?


	When I say “your politics is a gang sign,” I meant it — because who you affiliate with now really says a lot about you. Trump has done more racist s—t in the last six months than I think Ronald Reagan did in his whole f—king career. John Oliver said this, but I'm gonna paraphrase him: If Ronald Reagan woke up from the dead and saw the racist s—t Trump did in the last six months, he would c-m so hard he'd die again. So It's just like, if you wanna support that, that says a lot about you. But if you're on the other side that also says a lot about you because the Democrats are a losing, f–ked party. They're dismantled. So it really is a gang sign in the same way that gangs do that. It's the same way.


Curious what the reception was to this album when it first came out? I know you've always had rock influences in your music, but there seems to be a lot more punk and noise energy in Lay Down My Life. Were people hating at first?


	I mean yeah, because they just wanna hate — and some people just don't like me, and they can't admit it, so they be tryna pretend because they don't like me the snares aren't hitting as hard or somethin'. [I Lay Down My Life for You] got the same reception it always does. N—as hated in the beginning, and [then] they was like, “Oh wait this is actually good.” Yeah, f—k you. I get it.


That seems to be sort of a trend with your releases. How does that feel when that happens?


	It happens every time. When I released Scaring the Hoes people were like, “This is an abomination to music.” Now they asking me for Scaring The Hoes 2. It's so funny, when it comes out, n—as be hating.

	











I'm just theorizing, but maybe it's like a risk-taker type thing?


	I am a risk-taker! I'm one of the only risk-takers in rap! The rest of these motherf—kers literally do the same thing. Alchemist, Earl and them? They've been making the same f—king song for the last twenty f—king years. Nobody gives a s—t. I'm not them. I'm here to evolve, go farther, go harder and I'm gonna do my s—t. I'm not here to give people the bare minimum and have that just be okay, n—a. That's not me. I'm not wasting my potential like those motherf—kers. I'm not like that. I'm maximizing my s—t. I'm 35 years old — and Tupac said when Black men turn 30, they lose their fire. I have no loss of fire. I'm hot as s—t.


	These other motherf—kers, whatever. Y'all go do that boring ass s—t. I'm not with that. I'm here to take this s—t forward whether y'all like it or not y'all can kiss my Black ass. And they're gonna pretend like I'm not doing what I'm doing, but I've been doing it! And I've been doing it so well that people have to hate. They try to take the title from me and they just can't, because it's me. You can't imitate me. I'm me, It came from my brain. Keep imitating Earl, and making hyper-pop songs, whatever the f—k these n—as is doing. I'm gonna be doing my thing like I've been doing, 'cause clearly something is working.


Going off that, how do you feel about the state of rap right now?


	I think the state of rap is in the best state its been, ever. Because you have choices from everywhere. You can make any kind of rap you want. In the same way ‘90s rock was so big, Marilyn Manson got big. Rap is the No. 1 genre in the world, anybody can take off at any point off of one TikTok. It's like a free-for-all. I like that s—t. I enjoy that s—t because it evens things out. I don't have the same resources as some of these motherf—kers do so I gotta go off my talent. 

	











	Some of these motherf—kers come out here, and they just be havin' pyro and they be sitting in they f—king room on stage and all this dumb ass s—t and I'm like, ‘I don't wanna see all that s—t n—a, can you perform? And that's my thing. I'm gonna come with the production. I'm gonna come with all that s—t…because that's what I do. Same thing I did before I ever got in the music industry.


	I said, you know what? F—k these n—as. I can do this better. And I got in the music industry and I got better than all the f—king underground. Now it's time for me to take it farther. I don't wanna be in the underground no more. These n—as suck. They're boring and they're losers.


How important is the live performance to you?


	When I first came in, I knew it was important to be a good live performer because it would make me stand out. And I came from the hardcore scene in Baltimore so I was used to that kinda s—t. I'm always gonna have my energy, I'm always gonna do that but it's not enough to carry you on forever. Eventually you got to, like, do some s—t that's interesting. My set now is like some Batman Returns s—t. Fogged out, lights everywhere. There's a podium, because I was watching the Democratic National Convention and I was like, “Damn this s—t look crazy. What is this set up? A podium? Three drapes, and just a motherf—ker talkin' lookin important? I like that.” So I imitated that. I wanna keep evolving and growing, because I don't like being an underground rapper.


Do you feel that definition doesn't suit you anymore? Do people still try to put that on you?


	They will try to put it on me, and that's fine, I understand it. I just wanna blow past it so hard where you say it and you sound crazy. It'd be like calling Steve Lacy an underground rapper.

	











Why do you wanna blow past it?


	Because I'm not a trust-fund kid and I actually come from the projects. So I want actual success. I'm not, like, avoiding it because my parents already had it. I don't have the mindset that these other motherf—kers do. So I'm just like, “No, I wanna take it to the tippy-top, because I came from the bitty-bottom.”


You wanna be a superstar!


	Yes, and If I don't, fine, I'm fine being an underground rap legend, that's cool. But while I'm alive and active I'm gonna do everything to take this s—t to the top and not the middle.


What do you see for the future of rap when it comes to fusing it with hardcore music?


	I think a lot of people are gonna jump on that because what people are gonna do is they're gonna realize what you guys are doing is boring as s—t. People yearn for something new, especially in rap. We're yearning, we're tired. We don't wanna hear Drake complain about b—hes anymore. We don't f—king care, he's 40. We need something different. I'm here to try to provide and cultivate that as much as I can because rap fans are f—king bored. Their idea of doing something different is taking different sounding s—t and throwing trap drums on it, and that's not what I'm here to do. I'm here to really f—k you up. You get what I'm saying? And If I'm not, I did not do my f—king job. Conscious rap has Nas, trap rap has Future, experimental rap is me. That's it.


Do you feel there have been rappers that have come after you that have tried to bite your sound?


	I've seen plenty of it, but then I see guys like Matt Proxy from Minneapolis. He came out of my influence and he shows love and respect, but for some reason some of these guys, they come at me like we beefing or something. Sometimes I tweet a lot and you think I'm your friend. I'm not your f—king friend and I don't know you, and If you come up to me I'll slap the s—t out of you. So leave me alone. 

	











	I see people d—k riding and copying, but they don't wanna give homage, because it's me and they're offended by something I say or do. It's the same reason you won't see me on certain festivals because certain n—as don't want me to be on that s—t. I'm the Real Deal Holyfield motherf—ker. Imitation don't look good next to the real thing, do it?


It seems like you're very aware of all of these things that are going on.


	Everybody is. Everybody is. All artists are. When I was working with Ye, he was on his subreddit every day. Every day. Him and Bianca, every day, just looking at it. Everybody is. I'm not on my subreddit, but he was in there — because he was using it for, like, criticism and to be like, “Oh let me fix this.”


Do you think there's still a lot of misunderstanding surrounding who JPEGMAFIA is?


	People are kinda coming around, I see it a little bit. Because before it was literally just white teenagers projecting their insecurities on to me, and I was like, “Y'all realize I'm not a 15-year-old white boy in my house with my mom, right?” I'm a 35-year-old man and I run a business. I don't mind, it's not [about] being white. It's the people that take that and try to remove my Blackness to make their little narratives sound better. It's just like, that's not real. 


	So now people are starting to realize that these motherf–kers are just hating. I'm not doing anything egregious right now. I'm not getting on Twitter to say anything crazy, and when I do get on Twitter to say something crazy it's to promote an album. People just fall for it so well, you know?


	But I see a lot of people turning the tide and being like, “Okay, maybe this n—a just likes to make music, and his personality is not a white teenage boy. Maybe he was born in 1989 and he might not think like me.”

It tells the story of a horrific murder that upends the Chicago Prosecuting Attorneys' office when one of its own is suspected of the crime. The book was published in 1987 and was turned into a 1990 feature starring Harrison Ford as Rusty Sabich, the same role Gyllenhaal took on.

Kelley serves as showrunner on season two alongside Erica Lipez (We Were the Lucky Ones, The Morning Show). Abrams and Rachel Rusch Rich executive produce for Bad Robot. Kelley executive produces through David E. Kelley Productions alongside Matthew Tinker and Lipez. Dustin Thomason also executive produces.

EXCLUSIVE: Netflix's The Adventures of Cliff Booth is slowly but surely starting to take shape as sources tell Deadline that Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is joining Pitt, who is reprising the role that won him an Oscar. Elizabeth Debicki and Scott Caan also are on board with David Fincher directing from a script by Quentin Tarantino.


	Plot details are vague, but sources say the film will follow one of Tarantino's characters as he now serves as a Hollywood fixer. As for who Mateen is playing, while not confirmed, sources say the character would be in the vein of Jim Brown, who famously ended is Hall of Fame football career early to focus on acting starring in such hits as The Dirty Dozen.












	Netflix could not be reached for comment. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	When news broke that this movie was in the works, the town didn't know what to believe at first given that the idea of this project came to be sounds like something straight out of a script. So here is the backstory of how this came to be.


	Pitt indeed got Tarantino's blessing to show Pitt's Se7en director Fincher the script that focuses on subsequent adventures of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood's Cliff Booth character. And because Fincher is exclusive to Netflix, the movie — if it gets made — would be financed and released by Netflix, straight to streaming. Tarantino will be paid a fortune for his words, as he readies a play he's written and works on the final film he'll direct. That one seems headed for Sony, where Tarantino directed the first film. No way Tarantino would helm his final film for a streaming service, but he respects Fincher, and Netflix has been Fincher's domain since he helped establish the streaming giant with House of Cards.












	As for Mateen, he next has the Marvel Studios Wonder Man, where he stars in the title role. He also stars and executive produces the Man on Fire series for Netflix and star opposite Mark Wahlberg in Elegance Bratton's crime thriller By Any Means 


	Mateen won an Emmy for his work on the HBO limited series Watchmen, and his other film projects include The Trial of Chicago 7, Ambulance, The Matrix Resurrections, Candyman and the Aquaman films.


	He is repped by M88 and WME.

Mark Ruffalo is set to star opposite Ruth Madeley in the Apple Original Films pic Being Heumann with CODA director Siân Heder directing. The film is an adaptation of Judy Heumann's bestselling memoir.


	The script will be written by Heder and Rebekah Taussig. David Permut (Hacksaw Ridge, Face/Off) will produce alongside Kevin Walsh (Napoleon, Manchester by the Sea), whose The Walsh Company is under an overall deal with Apple. Heumann's managers John W. Beach and Kevin Cleary of Gravity Squared Entertainment will also serve as producers, with Heumann, Being Heumann co-author Kristen Joiner, and Diana Pokorny exec producing.

Being Heumann follows Heumann as she leads over a hundred disabled people to take over the San Francisco Federal Building, kicking off a 28-day sit-in in 1977. The protestors quickly form a tightly bound community, refusing to leave until the government enforces section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which required all federal spaces to become accessible. Ruffalo will play Joseph Califano.

	Heumann used a wheelchair for most of her life after contracting polio at 18 months old. She encountered discrimination early, including being denied the right to attend public school because she was considered a “fire hazard,” and was galvanized by these experiences to get involved with the fight for disability rights. In 1970, Heumann successfully sued the New York Board of Education after being denied a teaching license solely because of her disability, thereby becoming the first wheelchair user to teach in NYC public schools. Other highlights of her career include co-founding civil rights organization Disabled in Action, helping to develop and secure the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and leadership roles under both the Clinton and Obama administrations.

	











	Ruffalo can be seen next in the highly-anticipated HBO series TASK, which bows later this year. He also has the Amazon MGM Studios thriller Crime 101.


	He is repped by UTA and Lighthouse Management & Media.

Pixar is ready to leap back into the world of “The Incredibles.” 

Fans of Pixar's second most popular franchise will be happy to know the movie is in more than capable hands.

Peter Sohn – director of the sleeper hit “Elemental” – will helm the movie. Sohn also led the less than stellar performing “The Good Dinosaur.”

Pixar was not previously known for doing sequels. The storied animation studio was once known for creating one-off movies with A-list casts. Now, they mine their intellectual property to great effect.

“Toy Story,” “Monsters Inc.,” “Cars,” and “Inside Out” are among the other franchises in the studio's history.

“Coco” is set to join the fray with its own sequel coming in 2029.

“The Incredibles” follows Bob and Helen Parr, retired superheroes who are pulled back into action when a super fan turned supervillain draws them out. They are joined by their three kids – Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack – who developed powers of their own. 

The second movie, aptly titled “The Incredibles 2,” features the family fighting a cybercriminal bent on hypnotizing the world. 

Not much else is known about the third movie. But series writer Brad Bird (who also directed the first two movies) is working on the script. 

Bird and Sohn have worked together many times over with the latter having worked on every animated project of the former. Bird even chose Sohn to take over the third “Incredibles” movie personally. 

At the moment, Pixar is set to release their latest effort, “Elio,” later in June.

For Jerry Kane, the sovereign citizen movement is something between a political philosophy and a burgeoning psychosis. He criss-crosses the motel foyers of the American Midwest, giving sparsely attended seminars about how to avoid home foreclosures  — a curriculum that hinges upon insisting that bank loans are “fictitious,” among other conspiratorial tactics. Clutching onto the character's beliefs with a death grip as tight as it is tremulous, Nick Offerman's volcanic performance makes it difficult to know where Jerry's belief ends and his desperation begins. 

 










That's especially true for the extremist's teenage son Joe (an unrecognizably grown-up Jacob Tremblay), who's been raised in the shadow of his father's anti-government rage, but also crushes on the girl next door and harbors secret fantasies of going to school like a normal kid. The Daniel Plainview of the “power to the people” lecture circuit, Jerry ropes his own son into the family business while denying Joe the agency to choose his own future, creating a tension so powerful that it can only be resolved in death. 

 








Related Stories Celine Song on Why ‘Materialists' Skipping Festivals for Theaters Was the Right Move — and the Irresistible Influence of ‘Sex and the City' ‘The Phoenician Scheme' Production Design Stretches Even Wes Anderson's Theatricality to the Limit 

Whose death is a mystery that Christian Swegal's undercooked but effectively unsettling “Sovereign” chooses to keep secret until its closing moments, as this recession-era thriller — set in suburban Arkansas circa 2010 — has the luxury of being inspired by true events that never quite seeped into the collective unconscious. It was just another terrible thing in an American century full of terrible things. 

Swegal's film broadly glances toward the suggestion that this terrible thing — the specific account of Jerry and Joseph Kane, and not the sovereign citizen movement at large — is emblematic of the powerlessness that millions of people feel in a country that chokes them of their hope and opportunity. It's an idea that “Sovereign” attempts to explore through mirroring instead of close inspection, as Swegal's script rhymes the Kane saga with a glorified subplot about local police chief John Bouchart (Dennis Quaid) and his son Adam (Thomas Mann), who just had a child of his own. 

These stories, one about cops and the other about law-breakers, play out in parallel until they fatefully intersect during the final scenes, when “Sovereign” reaches for an emotional apoliticalness that gestures at both sides of a broken system without digging into the heart of its failures. Both John and Jerry are fathers trying to mold their sons in their own images in the face of an unrecognizable country, but neither of their struggles is meaningfully explored in the span of a 96-minute film that doesn't have time to do anything but shudder at these men's shared helplessness. 

 










Thanks to Offerman, however, it's a spectacle to watch Jerry argue for his own authority. The heartbreaking source of Jerry's pain isn't revealed until the third act, but his obsession with autonomy is so intense from the start that it almost seems to be self-perpetuating. A former roofer who now thinks of stalling the foreclosure of his home as his full-time job, Jerry isn't an especially dark presence when the film begins, at least not for an anti-government fundamentalist who abandoned all social niceties when he stopped paying taxes. There's something vaguely sinister about the fact that his teenage son has inherited his close-cut flat top, and that both of them look like cops from the 1950s, but Joe seems less afraid of his dad than he is afraid for him. 

It helps that Jerry's conspiracy theories are rooted in relatable frustrations, and that the thrust of his worldview — that U.S. citizens are subjects to their government “under commercial law” — has been reinforced by the country's decision to bail out the banks at the expense of the people they fucked over. In one particularly soft and sympathetic conversation near the start, Jerry remembers his father telling him that his public high school teacher was “lying” to him about the way of the world: “All my life I've been trying to figure out what the lie was,” he says to Joe. 

 










But to the hammer, everything looks like a nail, and the personal losses that Jerry has incurred over the decades have soured a healthy skepticism into a mad pathology. While he can afford the latest payments against his house, Jerry feels as though forking his money over would amount to being “conquered.” 

Offerman, whose screen persona was founded upon the deadpan libertarianism that Ron Swanson introduced to the lib fantasy of “Parks and Recreation,” has a knack for endowing every line of dialogue, no matter how irrelevant or deranged it might be, with pentecostal seriousness, and it's seductive — even endearing — to see the actor trace Jerry's fire and brimstone logic trace back to a place of more hospitable warmth. His relationship with a woman named Lesley Ann (Martha Plimpton) may not be rooted in anything more significant than a widower's need for companionship, but Jerry's hardline approach has a genuinely healing effect on her that makes it harder to dismiss the more hostile parts of his ethos. 

While every scene pulls Jerry apart at the seams, “Sovereign” is too vague and scattered to chart a legible path toward his breaking point. There are obvious landmarks along the way, none more significant than the simple traffic stop that lands Jerry a stint in detention, and Joe an eye-opening stay at a re-education facility that puts a different spin on personal responsibility. Offerman, though, isn't afforded the runway he needs to articulate how his son's emergent self-possession threatens him — sovereignty doesn't allow much room for compromise, as Jerry knows all too well. 

 










A former child star whose performance benefits from the meta-casting of watching him grow up before our eyes, Tremblay expertly illustrates the quietude of teenage becoming, but the facts of the case aren't enough to account for the pivotal decision his character makes in the end. It's a shame that “Sovereign” fails to adequately tee up that choice, as Swegal — an excellent director of action, it turns out — renders the consequences with a visceral intensity that's missing from the rest of a film that dulls its focus by extending its scope. 

John and Adam Bouchart's story might resonate with that of Jerry and Joe Kane's, and it would certainly justify a movie all its own, but what it adds to the Kanes' tragedy isn't worth the extent to which it robs this portrayal of their pain. Ultimately, Swegal's eagerness to listen for the echoes that reverberate across the opposite sides of the law makes it harder to hear whatever they're meant to say to each other, and the sentimentality he resorts to for clarity makes it harder to understand what their shared message is meant to tell us.

“Power is in the people,” Jerry tells his son. “Always remember that.” “Sovereign” doesn't allow us to forget, but in trying to assert a power of his own, Swegal — much like the people in his film — can't help but lose sight of his own strengths. 

 










“Sovereign” premiered at the 2025 Tribeca Festival. Briarcliff Entertainment will release it in theaters on Friday, July 11.

There are a few things Margarita (Lillian Carrier) knows for sure: she does not want to get a job, she definitely does not want to get a job which requires her to wear “hard pants,” she loves horses, she loves her mom, and she's not eager to engage in much of anything that might open her up to ridicule. And yet, the young autistic woman — and Carrier herself is autistic — has already gone against some of those internal rules. She went to college and got a degree. She spends a lot of her time riding around on an adult-sized tricycle with a stuffed horse head attached to it (he's known as “Cheeseburger”). She loves doing karaoke with her mom Sandy (a heartbreaking Gretchen Mol) at their favorite restaurant.

Like any person, the push-pull of Margarita's wants and needs are constantly butting up against each other. Margarita's disability may, of course, impact and affect those wants and needs in slightly different ways (versus those of a neurotypical person), but the core of her experience is common. It's simply the human condition, but as the protagonist of Lauren Meyering's creative and emotionally complex feature directorial debut, “Horsegirls,” Margarita's life offers new ways of viewing seemingly old stories. Classic stories.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






And while hobby horsing — the wholly unexpected sport at the center of Meyering's film and Margarita's great awakening — might itself not be old or classic, the film functions a bit like any other great sports film. And, just like its heroine, the seeming “difference” or “uniqueness” of the sport helps illuminate the common feelings at the center of “Horsegirls.” 

Based loosely on co-writer and producer Mackenzie Breeden's own experiences (the multi-hyphenate also appears in the film in a small supporting role), “Horsegirls” opens with Margarita's life already at an extreme crossroads, even if she does not yet realize it. Her mother Sandy is her sole parent after her father passed away from some sort of nebulous accident, and Sandy has already been through it in the intervening years. The death of her husband — who she energetically recalls in funny stories, including Margarita's favorite, about the genesis of her name — was hard enough, but going through three rounds of cancer since then has been particularly harder to swallow.

When we first meet Margarita, she's dreaming her way through a ride on Cheeseburger — Meyering blends in fantastical moments alongside the film's harder dramatic moments, a creative gamble that doesn't always work, even as it impresses — on her way to visit her mother at her chemotherapy appointment. No one is more assured of Margarita's capabilities than Sandy, but there's something deeply touching about the ways in which the film allows us to experience Margarita's revelations through her eyes (and Carrier's wonderful performance). Yes, Margarita is old enough and mature enough to come to Sandy's appointments, but it's also up to her to synthesize their true meaning. Eventually, she will.

 










But while Sandy might believe in Margarita's abilities, she's also constantly worried how they might be exploited. It's easy enough to agree that Margarita should get a job, but what happens if her boss doesn't fully understand the way she works? She should have friends, but what if they are making fun of her behind her back? For every moment Sandy is trying to nudge Margarita into the real world, she's also guilty of pulling her way back. And for Margarita, fierce and funny and possessed of a Jenny Slate-styled honk, none of this will do. She'd rather spend her time breaking into the local stables to hang out with the horses, who she adores and who her mother will no longer let her ride.

And then, one night, a discovery: hobby horsing. Inevitably, the moment that Margarita spies a hobby horsing class cavorting around a room in the local middle school will likely have a profound effect on the film's audience. What is that? What are they doing? Are those girls running around on stick horses, pretending to really be riding them? Yes, indeed, and it's not just a wacky little hobby, it's a full-fledged competitive sport, and there are serious contenders who'd like it to be an Olympic sport. 

But while others might see something to ridicule, Margarita sees something entirely different: a way to belong. It's a clever way into the film and Margarita's own evolutions, a nifty way to remind us all of the power of Margarita's vision, a push toward keeping our own eyes open to things that might look, at first glance, a little silly. 

 










Sandy, who has begun to slowly orient herself toward teaching Margarita all the ways to be an adult, doesn't see it that way. Enter: a major schism in the relationship, just at the moment that both mother and daughter should be cherishing every moment together. But while Meyering and Breeden's script builds around familiar moments and worries (the film is a coming-of-age tale, tinged with sports drama, whimsical comedy, and a strong interest in showing “disability” in a new light), Margarita's approach to everything tilts things into fresher spaces.

Carrier herself helped shape Margarita and her journey, and her perspective on the film's events adds an authenticity that feels new. It it, much like hobby horsing itself, one that also feels unexpected, occasionally misunderstood, and deserving of a closer look. 

“Horsegirls” premiered at the 2025 Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Bob Dylan, months after posting a video of rapper-turned-rocker MGK on his Instagram, has returned to narrate the trailer for a new album from the artist formerly known as Machine Gun Kelly. “Lost Americana is a personal excavation of the American dream, a journey to find what's been lost,” Dylan, the winner of the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, says at the outset of the new video. “This album is a love letter to those who seek to rediscover—the dreamers, the drifters, the defiant. It's a sonic map of forgotten places, a tribute to the spirit of reinvention and a quest to reclaim the authentic essence of American freedom. From the glow of neon diners to the rumble of the motorcycles, this is music that celebrates the beauty found in the in-between spaces where the past is reimagined and the future is forged on your own terms.” Watch the album trailer, directed by Sam Cahill, below.

MGK hasn't officially confirmed that it's the real Bob Dylan narrating his video, but all signs point to that being the case, as he posted a photo of Dylan on his Instagram story. Pitchfork has reached out to MGK and Dylan's respective representations for more information on the team-up.

MGK's new album, Lost Americana, is out August 8. The musician's follow-up to 2022's Mainstream Sellout will include the recent single “Cliché.”

							By 

	Brian Hiatt



In the wake of Sly Stone's death at age 82, Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid made the case for why Sly and the Family Stone deserve a place at the top of the canon of American bands. Here it is, in his own words.


	I would make the argument that there isn't a band of greater import. In terms of impact and the kind of shift they created, there isn't a greater American band. Everything was different after they appeared. Their influence is obvious and very, very subtle. Their influence in terms of the way they made their music, the things they said in their music, the hope that they engendered, the evolution of “rock star” as a difficult personality — all the things, good and indifferent, Sly and the Family Stone are the alpha and omega of it.


	The bands of the Sixties were creating the times that they were responding to. That's the thing that's so wild about bands of that era. They were responding to something that they were also making happen. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Sly waded into the middle of a very tumultuous and explosive time in racial relations. He was making music in a time in America where people were very divided. He was making music in a time when entertainment and the culture of entertainment were changing. The shine was on all the British Invasion bands, and he really took the momentum back. There was Motown, but Motown was very formal — tuxedos, very respectable. He came at the thing from a uniquely American perspective. He wasn't imitating those groups, but he studied what was happening with the British Invasion bands. The way he used choral harmony in what he was doing with the Family Stone was very much in line with what was happening with the Beatles and the Beach Boys. But he brought it in his own context. He was able to bring precision and abstraction together in a way that was unprecedented.

	











	There isn't a more American song than “Everyday People.” “Everyday People” isn't sentimental; it's not “We Are the World.” It looks at the way we don't get along and it says, well, “Different strokes for different folks.” And it also says, “We got to live together.” It doesn't say we have to hold hands and sing Kumbaya. It doesn't judge where anyone is coming from. It just lays out who we are and at the end of it says, we got to live together. “I am no better, neither are you.” That's very provocative. “We are the same, whatever we do.” It's revolutionary.

	He came at a pivotal time and he said things to America and Americans and to the world that they needed to hear. They may not have liked “Don't Call Me N—-r, Whitey,”  but he went there. That's the other side of “Everyday People” — demanding respect on his own terms. It's very powerful. He didn't flinch. He wasn't accommodating. He did what he did, dig it or don't dig it.


	It's easy to understate Sly Stone's influence on popular music. Of course he's a great songwriter. He had an unusual, revolutionary take on the American experience. But there's the small things: Just the way he used his voice as almost like an envelope filter, like the sound of “ow” and “wow” — that sound that you hear on Sugarfoot with the Ohio Players or Maurice White with Earth, Wind and Fire. That sound starts with Sly. That sound that you hear in Cameo, that use of voice as almost like a wah-wah pedal — that starts with Sly in pop music.


	The electric bass taking center stage in different ways than James Jamerson's did. The use of the thumb on the bass, bass turned into practically a percussion instrument as well as a melodic instrument, as well as a rhythmic instrument, as well as a harmonic instrument — that starts with Larry Graham. Bass guitarists from Victor Wooten, all the technicians, Stanley Clarke — Larry Graham is patient zero of that. That's the beginning of that. When you hear Louis Johnson [of the Brothers Johnson] and on down the line, all the acrobatics — that starts for real with Larry Graham.

	The idea of a mixed race and mixed gender band — he had two women who were vocalists. His sister Rose was a keyboardist as well as singer. Cynthia Robinson had a trumpet sound as distinct as any in pop music. Her sound and her approach — I think she's woefully underrated because she didn't play jazz. But her sound is as identifiable as Miles Davis or Louis Armstrong. Her trumpet playing is not generic. It's very specific timbre, very specific color to her playing. That horn section, there are only two, and the blend is incredible. And Freddie Stone, he was almost the power behind the throne. It's not just that Sly was a singular genius — that band was incredibly impactful.


	He was the original code-switcher. He was very articulate. He had a brilliant mind, but he also was connected to Oakland and everything. His ability to see the connections aside from the divisions — he saw connections in music.


	He was aided in that effort by having extraordinary collaborators in the band. He was able to utilize them to all of their greatest strengths. He just went with what people gave him. He went with what worked. His band members were completely devoted to his vision and they brought their extraordinary talents to bear.

	











	He was able to wield nostalgia, like “Hot Fun in the Summertime.” Even when I was a kid, that felt like the perfect summer that nobody actually ever had. Every day is sunny and the family's not fighting and everything is cool. He gave that to us. He was able to wield emotion in songs as well as his intellect. “My only weapon is my pen/And the frame of mind I'm in/I'm a songwriter, a poet.” That is tremendous.


	He was a visionary. He's the textbook example. When people say visionary, Sly Stone, Sylvester Stewart, was that, in many obvious and subtle dimensions. Certainly hearing “Family Affair” for me was seismic. I never heard anything like it, and it was like hearing “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds” at the time when I was a kid. I'm the same age as Prince, and I know Prince heard this music the same time I did. I relate to Prince so much because we're the same age. So he heard James Brown's Revolution of the Mind [Live at the Apollo Volume III]  at the same time. We heard There's a Riot Goin' On at the same time.

	Even though [1973's] Fresh was the end on a level, it's like a Hail Mary from beyond. Nobody is supposed to be able to come back like that after they've kind of undone everything, but he did, in a spectacular way.


	Sly gave us so much more than whatever his deficits were. If you think about his influence on Prince alone — and his influence goes far beyond that. And it's still having an influence today.

Yes are hitting the road this fall for a tour where they will perform the entirety of Fragile, the prog-rock band's 1971 classic that was reissued as a Super Deluxe Edition box set last year. The run is part of the band's ongoing Album Series.


	The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees will kick off the trek on Oct. 1 in Wallingford, Connecticut, at Toyota Oakdale Theatre. The run includes stops in Washington, D.C., Fort Lauderdale, Atlanta, Memphis, Milwaukee, Denver, and many other cities. Tickets go on sale June 13 — further details are available on their official website.


	Their fourth album, Fragile, went multiplatinum and featured signature tracks such as “Roundabout,” “Long Distance Runaround,” and “Heart of the Sunrise.” In addition to traversing all of Fragile, Yes will play additional classic cuts while on the road.


	In an interview with Rolling Stone Music Now, guitarist Steve Howe said “Roundabout” started with a few simple chords. “I must have played that to [former lead singer] Jon, [Anderson],” Howe said, “and he thought it was nice.” He added: “The backward piano, I believe, was my idea. It really gave it a kind of moment. That was a beautiful E minor… flipped on the tape and then lined up so that it would climax backwards with the attack of the chord.”

	Discussing the album in a press release, Howe said, “It's fairly ‘odd-ball,' but we were at the height of our creativity, determined for success.” He added: “It gave us confidence, further than our own in-stock belief, we'd crafted this unusual but noticeable musical twist to rock and what later became prog.”

	In the spiritual sequel to his legendary 2004 Victoria's Secret commercial, Bob Dylan has provided narration for a new trailer announcing Machine Gun Kelly‘s next album, Lost Americana. 


	“Lost Americana is a personal excavation of the American dream — a journey to find what's been lost,” Dylan drawls in the short clip. He goes on to describe the album as “a love letter to those who seek to rediscover” and “a sonic map of forgotten places, a tribute to the spirit of reinvention, and a quest to reclaim the essence of American freedom.”


	Dylan's narration is accompanied by a montage of home movie footage of MGK and friends, including some shots of the musician riding a motorcycle decked out in a custom Lost Americana biker jacket. 


	There's a snippet of music, too, at the end of the clip, a wild synth arpeggio that jumps out after Dylan says: “From the gold neon diners to the rumble of the motorcycles, this is music that celebrates the beauty found in the in-between spaces. Where the past is reimagined and the future is forged on your own terms.”  

	











	Along with sharing the trailer, MGK said Lost Americana would arrive Aug. 8. The album will be his first in three years, following 2022's Mainstream Sellout. MGK has yet to reveal the full track list for Lost Americana, but the album will feature his recent single, “Cliché.” 


	“Cliché” is actually one of several songs MGK has dropped this year, along with “Your Name Forever,” “Come Pick Me Up,” and a cover of the Goo Goo Dolls' “Iris” with Julia Wolf. It's unclear if any of these songs will also appear on the album.

	











	As for Dylan's involvement in the trailer, it comes after the legendary singer-songwriter posted, seemingly out of nowhere, a video of MGK rapping on his Instagram earlier this year. Even MGK was astounded, revealing he learned of Dylan's post while discussing with friends some of his concerns and reservations about his next album.

	“Just the originator of doing everything opposite of what people wanted him to do, randomly posting a video of me back in the day rapping in a vinyl shop,” MGK said. “I'm just like, ‘What the fuck?' Just trust the signs, man. That was so cool. I'm so grateful.”


	For those looking for some insight into the ever-mysterious movements of Dylan's taste and artistic predilections, who crave some explanation for how he even became aware of Machine Gun Kelly in the first place, Dylan scholar Ray Padgett shared a theory on Bluesky that is as hilarious as it is believable. “All because the dude has the same name as an old gangster Bob was googling. What a ride,” Padgett wrote.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q='unidentified+flying+objects'","'Truth' behind Area 51 UFO conspiracies revealed in bombshell US report","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/truth-behind-area-51-ufo-35368207","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 14:29:00 GMT","

A bombshell US Government report has shone new light on Area 51 conspiracy theories after decades of UFO sightings. Believers have long claimed that extra-terrestrial life is being hidden at the high-security base in Nevada, with fantastical stories of alien autopsies and secret otherworldly technology fuelled by repeated sightings of unexplained flying objects.

The US government has always maintained the Area 51 is merely a flight testing facility. Now, a new review from a US Department of Defense taskforce has revealed that both the Pentagon and the Justice Department deliberately fuelled UFO conspiracy theories - including those about Area 51 - to conceal Cold War-era military projects, such as stealth fighter jets.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the report states that an Air Force colonel was sent on a mission to spread false information about Area 51 in the early 1980s.

This included visiting a nearby bar and handing owner fake photos of flying saucers, sparking a new frenzy of rumours about the base.

The since-retired colonel later told Pentagon investigators that the purpose of mission had been to distract the public from the development of the then-secret F-117 Nighthawk stealth aircraft.

Officials hoped this would help shield the project from surveillance by the USSR, he said.

Sean Kirkpatrick, a former head of Pentagon's UFO office who now heads the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) taskforce, trawled through decades of military reports on unidentified aerial phenomena for the new report.

He found that on several occasions, alien conspiracy theories were planted by the Pentagon themselves.

This included a bogus alien-hunting squad, known as 'Yankee Blue', which recruited serving members of the Air Force through a hazing ritual.

Candidates for the project were shown pictures of flying saucers and told they would be helping to 'reverse-engineering alien aircraft' while being sworn to secrecy.

Servicemen involved in the programme would only find out it was fake decades later when it was officially declassified in 2023.

Mr Kirkpatrick's review also evaluated one famous incident from 1967 involving former US Air Force captain Robert Salas, who described seeing a 'UFO' disable ten nuclear missiles at a base in Utah. Mr Salas said he was ordered to stay silent about the incident.

But the report found that the technical issues likely resulted from a secret electromagnetic pulse (EMP) test used to gauge the base's resilience to interference, which Mr Salas and his colleagues had not been told about.

Some parts of the AARO's first public report were withheld last year at the request of the US Air Force, with a full follow-up containing all redacted details expected to be released later this year.

A series of random questions answered by Harvard experts.

			Harvard Staff Writer		

It was a simple question asked over lunch in 1950. Enrico Fermi, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who helped usher in the atomic age, was dining with colleagues at Los Alamos, New Mexico, when the conversation turned to extraterrestrial life. Given the vastness of the universe and the statistical likelihood of other intelligent civilizations, Fermi wondered, “Where is everybody?”

Seventy-five years later, David Charbonneau, a professor of astronomy at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, says we're closer to an answer. 

When Fermi posed his famous paradox, Charbonneau said, we hadn't identified a single planet beyond our solar system. The 1995 discovery of the first exoplanet allowed scientists to break the paradox into smaller, more solvable questions: How many stars are there? How many of those stars have planets? What fraction of those planets are Earth-like? What fraction of Earth-like planets support life? And finally, what fraction of that life is intelligent? 

“We have made tremendous progress on those questions,” said Charbonneau, who co-chaired the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's 2018 Committee on Exoplanet Science Strategy. “We now know that one in every four stars, at least, has a planet that is the same size as the Earth and is rocky, and is the same temperature as the Earth, so it's what we would call a habitable-zone planet. Those are very secure conclusions.”

The next step is identifying biosignatures — chemicals in a planet's atmosphere that could only be there because of biological processes. Charbonneau says that the necessary evidence faces a major technological hurdle: It requires far more data than our current instruments can provide.  

Recognizing that challenge, the National Academies' Committee for a Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020, on which Charbonneau served as a panel member, recommended the development of the Habitable Worlds Observatory, a space telescope designed to hunt for chemical signs of life on other planets. The HWO, if it were built and launched, would image at least 25 potentially habitable worlds. The project remains tentative. 

There's still the question of just how common life, let alone intelligent life, really is. It's possible, Charbonneau said, that if you take any habitable-zone planet, add water, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus, and give it about a billion years, life will develop. Or you could have those very same conditions, and it would all remain stubbornly lifeless. You only have to look at the first habitable planet to have a much better idea how common life is.

“If you look at the first one and there isn't life, you've already learned, from a statistical perspective, that it's not a guarantee that life forms. And then you have to think logarithmically. You have to think, maybe it's one in 1,000 or maybe it's one in a billion, or maybe it's one in a trillion. And all those possibilities basically would mean there's no life that we can interact with.” 

Avi Loeb, Frank B. Baird Jr. Professor of Science at Harvard, says the search for extraterrestrial life should expand beyond traditional approaches. Loeb is the founder of the Galileo Project, which studies both unidentified aerial phenomena spotted here on Earth and physical objects that may have come from other solar systems. 

The project is named for the Italian astronomer who was persecuted in the 17th century  for arguing the Copernican theory that the Earth was not the center of the universe. Proof of billions of habitable planets in our galaxy alone is a reminder that we're not as unique as we think we are, Loeb says. “The message from nature is, don't be presumptuous, you are not privileged.”

Loeb made headlines in 2018 when he suggested that ‘Oumuamua, the first known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, could be an alien lightsail or debris from an extraterrestrial ship. Despite pushback against the idea, Loeb says we shouldn't brush anomalies under the carpet: We should at least get the data to find out for certain. He thinks that Fermi was doing himself a disservice by wondering idly about whether there were aliens, like someone who complains of being lonely but won't try to meet new people.

 “It's the most romantic question on Earth,” Loeb said. “Do we have a partner out there?”

For Charbonneau, the chances of finding that partner are slim. Even under ideal circumstances — if our nearest interstellar neighbor, Proxima Centauri, hosted intelligent life with radio technology — sending a single message back and forth once would take the better part of a decade. 

There's also the chance that the aliens just aren't that into us.

“If you look around on the Earth, there are a lot of organisms, some would say intelligent organisms, that are not interested in developing technology, and they're also maybe not interested in communicating,” Charbonneau said. “We humans love to communicate, and we love to connect, and maybe that's just not a property of life: Maybe that's really a property of humans.”

Disinformation spreading on social media platforms has stoked an already tense situation.

By Steven Lee Myers

Misleading photographs, videos and text have spread widely on social media as protests against immigrant raids have unfolded in Los Angeles, rehashing old conspiracy theories and expressing support for President Trump's actions.

The flood of falsehoods online appeared intended to stoke outrage toward immigrants and political leaders, principally Democrats.

They also added to the confusion over what exactly was happening on the streets, which was portrayed in digital and social media through starkly divergent ideological lenses. Many posts created the false impression that the entire city was engulfed in violence, when the clashes were limited to only a small part.

There were numerous scenes of protesters throwing rocks or other objects at law enforcement officers and setting cars ablaze, including a number of self-driving Waymo taxis. At the same time, false images spread to revive old conspiracies that the protests were a planned provocation, not a spontaneous response to the immigration raids.

The confrontation escalated on Monday as new protests occurred and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced — on X — that he was mobilizing 700 Marines from a base near Los Angeles to guard federal buildings. They are expected to join 2,000 members of the California National Guard whom Mr. Trump ordered deployed without the authorization of the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, who normally has command of the troops.

The latest deployments prompted a new wave of misleading images to spread — some purporting to show Marines and the military service's weapons in action. One was a still from “Blue Thunder,” a 1983 action-thriller about a conspiracy to deprive residents of Los Angeles of their civil rights. It features a climactic dogfight over the city's downtown.

Police say 19 attacks launched on Cali and nearby towns, hitting police posts, municipal buildings and civilians

Colombia has been rocked by a string of coordinated bomb and gun attacks that killed at least four people across the country's south-west, deepening a security crisis roiling the Andean country.

Police said attackers launched 19 attacks on targets in Cali – the country's third largest city – and several nearby towns, hitting police posts, municipal buildings and civilian targets.

The national police chief, Carlos Fernando Triana, said assailants had attacked targets with car bombs, motorcycle bombs, rifle fire and a suspected drone.

“There are two police officers dead, and a number of members of the public are also dead,” he said.

Police later said at least two civilians were among those killed, and 12 others were injured.

In Cali and the towns of Villa Rica, Guachinte and Corinto, AFP journalists witnessed the tangled wreckage of vehicles surrounded by scorched debris.

The assaults came days after the attempted assassination of a presidential candidate in Bogotá put the country on edge.

Many Colombians are fearful of a return to the violence of the 1980s and 1990s, when cartel attacks, guerrilla violence and political assassinations were commonplace.

In the town of Corinto, resident Luz Amparo was at home when the blast gutted her bakery.

“We thought it was an earthquake,” she told AFP. “My husband said: ‘No, they are shooting.'”

Her phone began to ring off the hook, and she went to check on her store. As she rounded the corner, neighbors began to look in her direction.

“Everything was levelled,” she said.

Police and experts blamed Tuesday's attacks on a dissident faction of the once-powerful Farc guerrilla group.

Security expert Elizabeth Dickenson of the International Crisis Group said the attacks were likely the work of a group known as the Central General Staff (EMC).

“This is a particularly well-coordinated offensive. It really demonstrates the capacity that the group has built,” she told AFP.

“And I think very alarmingly it demonstrates their ability to conduct operations in the metropolitan area of Cali.”

Dickenson said the group may be trying to stop an ongoing military operation that is reported to have injured or killed the group's veteran leader, known as “Iván Mordisco”.

“They are trying to raise the cost of that military initiative for the government,” said Dickenson.

In a statement on Tuesday, the EMC warned the public to stay away from military and police installations, but stopped short of claiming responsibility.

The attacks come three days after conservative senator Miguel Uribe, 39, was shot twice in the head at close range by an alleged hitman while campaigning in Bogotá.

That attack has stunned Colombians, prompted speculation about who was responsible and raised questions about the response of the country's president, Gustavo Petro.

Petro has speculated on social media that the hit was ordered by an international “mafia” and claimed that Uribe's security detail was suspiciously reduced the day he was shot.

On Tuesday, a 15-year-old pleaded not guilty to carrying out the attempted assassination. The government believes he was a hired gun.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Rep. Rosa DeLauro grilled Secretary Pete Hegseth on his plans for speeding up the nation's lagging shipbuilding process, saying the previous administration was similarly opaque about its plans

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., confronted Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth during a heated House Appropriations Committee hearing Tuesday over years-long lags in the nation's shipbuilding capacity. 

The top Appropriations Democrat accused the Defense Department (DOD) of failing to present a clear, transparent plan to ramp up production at a time when China's shipbuilding capabilities are estimated to be 230 times greater than the U.S.'s. She said the Biden administration had been similarly opaque. 

DeLauro zeroed in on what she characterized as a troubling shortfall between the Navy's current production capacity and future strategic needs.

""Do you know where our submarine production currently stands and whether current production is sufficient to bridge the gap between current fleet size and projected need?"" she asked.

""There is a gap,"" Hegseth admitted, ""but we believe we are closing it.""

But DeLauro wasn't satisfied, demanding detailed data to back up that claim.

""We do not have any information or data that can substantiate what you're saying,"" she shot back. ""Give us the details.""

""We've had difficulty with the prior administration, and I don't mind calling them out. What is your plan for the future?""

Asked what the status is of the department's investment in submarine programs, Hegseth boasted of a 14% increase in funding in the fiscal year 2026 budget request for the Columbia-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines and a ""substantial increase"" in the Virginia-class fast-attack submarines as well. 

But the congresswoman raised concerns about reports that the Pentagon plans to shift $3.1 billion in funding for the Columbia-class submarine program from FY2026 to FY2027 and FY2028.

""This creates a serious problem for industry in the short term and hampers shipbuilders' ability to reach an adequate production rate,"" DeLauro warned. ""Have you been in contact with Electric Boat or Huntington Ingalls about your plans?""

Hegseth pushed back, saying top Pentagon officials were in regular communication with shipyards.

""Almost every day,"" he said. ""We're actively engaged… to make sure their needs are being met and their shortfalls are being addressed so we can close that gap in real time.""

DeLauro pointed to a missed deadline for placing key submarine contracts authorized under the December continuing resolution. Congress had approved $5.7 billion for two Block IV and one Block V Virginia-class submarines, with the understanding that contracts would be in place by February 2025. The Defense Department did not finalize the contracts until April 30.

""We have made a serious investment,"" DeLauro said. ""Now we want to know where that is going and what your plan is.""

When pressed for specifics, Hegseth thanked the committee for its flexibility and acknowledged prior mismanagement under previous administrations. But DeLauro cut him off.

""I want your plan,"" she said. ""Can we get that in writing and on paper? Because we don't have anything today. We have zip, nada.""

Hegseth promised to provide the committee with written details of the department's submarine production plan.

""We have the details, and we will provide them,"" he said.

DeLauro insisted she wanted the information before the committee's markup later the same day.

The U.S. Navy's shipbuilding capacity has been on the decline since the Cold War. In the 1980s, the U.S. aimed for a 600-ship fleet; today, it struggles to maintain 300 operational vessels. 

The Navy currently operates under 50 attack submarines, well below the long-term requirement of 66 boats, as outlined by recent Navy force structure assessments.

Shipyards like Electric Boat (General Dynamics) in Connecticut and Huntington Ingalls Industries in Virginia and Mississippi are the primary builders of nuclear submarines—but both are operating near maximum capacity and face major workforce and supply chain challenges.

Shipbuilders report significant difficulties in hiring, training and retaining welders, pipefitters, engineers and designers. Shipbuilding's highly specialized supply chain was hit especially hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and has been slow to recover.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","The Labubus got me — and I learned a trick to finally buy one","https://www.businessinsider.com/where-to-buy-labubu-reddit-tiktok-popmart-game-2025-6","Tue, 10 Jun 2025 08:36:00 GMT","

I thought I was strong. Then I saw their strange, toothy smiles.

The Labubus — little plush monster toys specifically marketed at adults — hooked me. Over the next weeks, I embarked on an adventure of internet rabbit holes, hourslong TikTok livestreams, and several nights playing a game online before I finally learned a trick from Reddit that helped me snag one.

I'm far from alone in my obsession: The Labubu craze has taken hold in the US, Asia, and the UK. There's something mesmerizing about the creature, originally created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung a decade ago. Now it is part of ""The Monsters"" line from Pop Mart, a Chinese toy company whose 2024 revenue doubled from the year prior, thanks in part to the ""particularly impressive"" performance of these crazy little creatures.

Labubus first became popular overseas, as my colleagues in Singapore chronicled all the way back in November; we're just the latest country to catch the fever. In just the last month, US search interest in Labubus has spiked — and Americans are scrambling to get their hands on them. They are part status symbol, part weird little guy, and part bag accessory. Indeed, once they came across my social media feeds, I went from thinking ""What is that?"" to ""I must have one.""

But it turns out that's easier said than done. The smaller Labubus that people hang on their bags start at $22, and the larger ones go up to $180, but you can't just go to a store or website and buy them. Instead, I entered the new world of Labubu ""drops"" — the timed releases of the monsters on their official web home — and learned that, to buy an authentic Labubu, my journey had only just begun.

First came the Pop Mart TikTok lives: In the latest iteration of live shopping, the company holds live streams on TikTok where Labubus may or may not be offered. You have to bide your time and act fast to get a Labubu this way. Unfortunately, I am a brain-rotted geriatric Gen Zer and did not have the patience to stay on a livestream for what could be hours, though in the process, I began to understand the appeal of having QVC blasting on a TV in the background.

The next method was going in person to a Pop Mart. There are a few stories in New York City, but there's no guarantee that they'd be stocked. Pop Mart paused in-store sales in the UK due to long lines, so I wasn't entirely sold on going in person. Emily Brough, head of IP licensing at Pop Mart, said in a statement to BI that Labubus are available in the US through a ""buy online, pick up in-store model"" — another potential hurdle, since the most coveted ones seem to almost always be sold out online.

This is where my animal brain came in: The harder it became to get a Labubu, the more I wanted one. Its comforting texture, popular appeal, and exclusive availability created a perfect storm of psychological urges to get me to spend my money, and, as it seemed only harder and harder, all I wanted to do was buy one of these little monsters.

In the meantime, I did get two Lafufus, knock-off Labubus that have become ubiquitous at New York City street stands and gift shops. They are horrifying, and I love them. I named one after one of my editors, who isn't quite sold on the hype around the cute monsters.

Finally, I came across a new method for acquiring one of the monsters: Pop Mart launched a live game called Pop Now. Every night at a certain time, players have a chance to click through numbered virtual boxes containing Labubus, and, if you are fast enough to click on one before another player, you can virtually shake it and claim your prize. Then — and only then — would you get the privilege of buying one.

I spent several nights toiling away at Pop Now to no avail. Finally, I checked the Labubu subreddit, which is filled with similarly enthralled (and very helpful) folks. From them, I learned that changing a few numbers in the URL to pull up different numbered lots would allow me to view boxes that aren't necessarily public-facing yet. This basically entailed me putting random numbers into the middle of the URL, while preserving the numbers at the start and end of the URL because they demarcated the type of product I was looking for. Thus, I snagged my Labubu. It's on the way from China, and it's pink, aka lychee berry; I am very excited.

Do I think my Labubu will solve all of my problems? No. Did I need one? Probably not. But the thrill of the chase got me; it is, after all, a consumer tale as old as Beanie Babies and other trinkets. It also shows what Americans are willing to spend on right now, even with economic concerns and tariff confusion — it turns out we just want weird little guys.

This natural gas field in Turkmenistan has been on fire for decades, but officials say it may soon be running on empty.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

On planet Earth, fire is usually a transient phenomenon—even the strongest of wildfires will eventually succumb to human and/or meteorological intervention. But the same can't be said for the Darvaza gas crater in Turkmenistan, known colloquially as the “Gates of Hell.” This natural gas field has been burning continuously for decades thanks to its steady supply of seeping methane, and in that time, this devilish pit has become one of the country's most popular tourist attractions despite its location in the middle of the Karakum desert, roughly 160 miles north of the capital city of Ashgabat. 

Turkmenistan's authoritarian leader, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, has previously stated that he wants to snuff out the Gates of Hell once and for all (though the latest pronouncement came years after he reportedly went off-roading around the crater). Now, a new report suggests those efforts may be bearing fruit. Last Thursday, officials in Turkmenistan said that gas being emitted from the pit has diminished three-fold, though the Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that no timeframe for this gaseous decrease was provided. This news is in line with previous reports last year that satellite observations of the Gates of Hell showed a 50 percent decline in emissions. 

Despite its status as a popular tourist attraction (at least, for a recluse country like Turkmenistan), there's some debate about how the gas crater initially formed. The popular story goes that Soviet prospectors accidentally collapsed a mine in the 1960s and then lit the gas on fire, but local reporting says that the fire was actually started in the 1980s to prevent the harmful gas from escaping. As National Geographic reported in 2013, there are no records or reports of the gas field's initial formation. 

Although the never-ending burn pit draws its fair share of pyromaniacs, closing off the pit is likely for the best for many reasons. The harmful gas impacts the local population and contributes to climate change—especially since methane is an extremely potent greenhouse gas (much more so than carbon dioxide). 

Berdymukhamedov has called for the closure of the gas crater for at least 15 years, and while filling the pit has been considered, most experts say that the gas would likely just escape somewhere else. However, in the last few years, it appears that the government has made some progress. In 2024, CNN reported that the government was drilling exploratory wells near the crater—both to draw away the pit's methane and to leverage the natural resource for other purposes—but due to the country's secretive nature, CNN adds that these reports are only rumors. 

Of course, as the flames of the Darvaza gas crater slowly flicker out, some locals are concerned about the loss of tourism dollars from people flocking to the area to see the strange phenomenon. 

Extinguishing the “Gates of Hell” may only be the beginning of Turkmenistan's problems.

The Italian national team's World Cup qualification hopes could be under serious threat again as they're still in search of a new boss. Following Luciano Spaletti's dismissal, Gli Azzurri were targeting Claudio Ranieri, but the current AS Roma advisor has now rejected that proposal.

Gli Azzurri's World Cup 2026 qualification started in the worst possible fashion as they stumbled into a 3-0 defeat against Norway. That disappointing loss resulted in the decision to part ways with Luciano Spalletti, who coached Italy for the last time during their 2-0 win over Moldova on Monday.

The Italian Football Federation's plan initially was to appoint Claudio Ranieri, despite the veteran already taking the advisor role at Roma. FIGC didn't mind Ranieri's status and will allow him to keep that position with the Giallorossi.

However, the latest reports from Italian media (via Fabrizio Romano) stated that the former Leicester City manager has rejected Italy's offer.

“It's a great honor for me to receive that proposal, but I decided to continue my role at AS Roma as part of the management,” Ranieri said.

According to Football Italia, the 73-year-old is most likely not convinced that he can handle doing both roles at the same time. Knowing the big responsibility and pressure the Italian national team coach has, Ranieri seems to be making a reasonable decision.

Following Ranieri's rejection, FIGC will be hunting for other candidates, with former AC Milan boss Stefano Pioli being one of the candidates.

 Reilly Opelka withstood multiple rain delays and a stern on-court test from Jesper de Jong Tuesday at the Libema Open. 

 The big-serving American produced a strong finish in tough conditions at the ‘s-Hertogenbosch ATP 250 to earn a 6-7(5), 7-6(5), 6-2 first-round triumph. Opelka let slip a 5-2 lead in the second set, and later stood just two points from defeat at 5/5 in the tie-break, but he held firm to force a deciding set which he subsequently dominated. 

 “It was a tricky match. He had me for sure,” said Opelka. “It's the first time I've played Jesper. Obviously I've been watching him, especially over the past couple of week when he's had a lot of big wins. I've been really impressed. I watched him play [Davidovich] Fokina in Rome, and I hadn't really seen him play before that. He beat [Joao] Fonseca last week, so he's really improving and a hell of a player.” 



 Opelka struck 19 aces past De Jong, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to secure a two-hour, 43-minute triumph on his ‘s-Hertogenbosch debut. The No. 87 in the PIF ATP Rankings, who upset Novak Djokovic en route to the Brisbane final in Januray, next faces a second-round clash with Nicolas Jarry. Top seed Daniil Medvedev is a potential quarter-final opponent for the winner. 

 Zizou Bergs and Mackenzie McDonald also earned three-set wins on Tuesday in the Netherlands. Bergs prevailed 6-3, 1-6, 7-6(3) in an all-Belgian affair against #NextGenATP Alexander Blockx to set a meeting with fourth seed Alexei Popyrin. Meanwhile McDonald overcame Mattia Bellucci 6-1, 6-7(4), 6-3 and will next face third seed Karen Khachanov. 

 With Hubert Hurkacz against Roberto Bautista Agut among the matches moved to Wednesday due to the interruptions in ‘s-Hertogenbosch, the only other men's singles winner on Day 2 was Otto Virtanen. The Finnish wild card downed Tomas Martin Etcheverry 7-6(6), 7-5 to book a second-round appointment with Nuno Borges.

The German is a highly touted prospect, with the buzz now only intensifying.

Americans made headway with historic runs while veterans struggled in Paris.

With his triumph in Geneva today, Djokovic has now won at least one title every year since he was a teenager in 2006.

Americans made headway with historic runs while veterans struggled in Paris.

Carlos Alcaraz and Coco Gauff enjoyed obvious triumphs while others left Paris with more questions than answers.

From Alexander Zverev's mind-boggling 'casino roulette' timepiece to Coco Gauff's rare Rolex model, these are tennis accessories on a whole new level.

From personal logos to custom accessories like shoes, bags, and warm-up gear, these are some of the best personalized touches we've spotted in Paris this year.

The three-time champion appeared emotional as he left Court Philippe-Chatrier, after placing a kiss on the clay at the end of his possible 'farewell match' in Paris.

A former Djokovic apprentice, Sinner beat the master to the punch every time.

The Italian defeated the 24-time Grand Slam champion in the semifinals of Roland Garros on Friday for his fourth consecutive win in their head-to-head series.

Sinner will face Alcaraz in a rematch of their five-set semifinal from last year.

This slate is too big for a single “Pick of the Day”—we break down both Friday showdowns.

Djokovic has had the upper hand on clay and at Grand Slams, but Sinner has won their last three meetings in a row.

The 24-time Grand Slam champion was brilliant against Alexander Zverev, but now faces a quantum leap in pace from the other side of the net.

Djokovic is through to his 51st Grand Slam semifinal, and 13th at Roland Garros.

Throughout his career, Zverev has struggled when the stakes are highest. Can he change that against the greatest—and mentally toughest—player in tennis history?

Defending champion Iga Swiatek is among those on the lookout for the colorful murals.

AI predicts the second week of the clay-court Slam.

The iconic football trophy briefly sat behind Nole Monday at Roland Garros, after Ousmane Dembélé stepped out to present the hardware.

He's just the second tennis player ever to win 100 career matches at the clay-court major, joining Rafael Nadal.

The three-time champion is yet to lose a set in Paris.

""I will definitely watch it if I'm not playing (in the) night session,"" Novak Djokovic said with a big smile. ""FYI, Roland-Garros schedule.""

The three-time champion is into the third round without losing a set.

Before his second-round match, Djokovic was spotted taking in the sights like a tourist while getting some exercise.

In all sports, there are advantages to being at home. But in Paris, playing against a French player can feel as though the whole world is against you.

The 19-year-old took down Frenchman Alexandre Muller, and silenced the raucous crowd on Court 14.

Plus: Norrie beats Medvedev in a slump-snapping marathon, and Baptiste, with a career-high ranking, gets perhaps her most important win yet.

Djokovic scored a comfortable victory over 98th-ranked Mackenzie McDonald in a match that was played under a closed roof.

While his Roland Garros farewell ceremony was mostly kept a surprise, Nadal could always count on Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray being there.

With his triumph in Geneva today, Djokovic has now won at least one title every year since he was a teenager in 2006.

He's won titles all over the world—and incredibly, almost three quarters of his 100 career titles have been “big” titles.

No. 100 is within the Serbian's grasp in Geneva. How did he get here?

The 24-time Grand Slam champ knocked out Cameron Norrie to reach his 143rd career final.

After battling injury and illness throughout the clay-court season, the 22-year-old is eager to shift his focus back to the court.

Plus, thoughts on the big question: Alcaraz or Sinner?

Prepare for the clay-court Grand Slam like the three-time champion did in 2024 ahead of his Olympic gold medal-winning performance.

All three landed in the top half, leaving defending champ Carlos Alcaraz in the bottom half.

Djokovic had gone winless in Monte Carlo and Madrid, and withdrew from Rome.

“My life has changed a lot, but for better, to be honest,” says the Serbian in Switzerland. “It's just a new chapter that I'm embracing.”

Plus, how are former Roland Garros finalists Casper Ruud and Alexander Zverev one week out of a Paris return?

“Thank you for all the hard work, fun & support,” Djokovic wrote of their six-month partnership.

The Serbian is 0-2 on clay this season, and hasn't won a match since Miami.

Fellow tennis legend Venus Williams also features in the French brand's ""Play With Icons"" campaign.

Can the Serbian, like the American at the 1991 US Open, record a rare win over Father Time?

The former world No. 1 will head to this year's Roland Garros without a clay-court match win.

The Serbian is currently winless on clay this season.

Stream it live on TennisChannel.com, Saturday at 9:30 a.m. ET.

With title holders playing musical chairs and Nadal retired, there's a greater sense of belief among the locker room.

Presented by BetMGM, it's the latest edition of Game, Set, Bet.

Tennis starred throughout the glitzy reception in Madrid.

The former champion is back in the Spanish capital for the first time in three years.

Early European clay season plot lines on the ATP Tour also include Rublev hiring Safin and the upcoming departure of CEO Massimo Calvelli.

He's the ninth player to win his first two career meetings with the legend, and just the fourth to do it without losing a set.

The 24-time major winner dropped to 0-2 against Alejandro Tabilo on Wednesday.

Stream the second-round match live on TennisChannel.com at 7:20 a.m. ET.

There are many questions about the 21-year-old's form. He's already defused them all.

Last spring, Djokovic lost to Tabilo in Rome after he was accidentally struck on the head by a fan's metal water bottle.

The Spaniard is the betting favorite to win this 1000-level event, despite the fact that he has struggled mightily since the start of the season.

Find out why Djokovic won't be coached by Andy Murray in Monaco.

Jannik Sinner, Aryna Sabalenka, Novak Djokovic and more of the 20 highest-ranked players included their handwritten signatures.

Plus, Stefanos Tsitsipas looks to continue his mysterious mastery of Monte Carlo, and more storylines we're following at the historic clay-court event.

The defending champion resides in Monaco and often boasts about the scenes on social media, while the 99-singles title holder has had notable celebrity run-ins in years past.

The 37-year-old leaves a hardcourt swing with some hard thinking.

This was not the Carlos Alcaraz we've come to expect, and more of our biggest takeaways from Indian Wells and Miami.

The 19-year-old sealed the memory to last a lifetime by defeating his idol, Novak Djokovic.

Legends often struggle in finals late in their careers. Djokovic's biggest struggle was Mensik.

""My knee was hurting a lot. I was just lucky that the referee was having lunch.""

The 19-year-old outdid the 24-time Grand Slam champion—and his idol—in the Miami Open final, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4).

The unseeded 19-year-old won two tiebreaks for his first career ATP tournament win.

Will Djokovic enter the 100-title club, or will Mensik pull off a shocker?

Can the teen deny his childhood idol a historic 100th title?

Djokovic acknowledged the soccer star after a decisive win on Friday.

The ailing Bulgarian was no match for Djokovic in a 6-2, 6-3 semifinal.

Stream live on TennisChannel.com Friday at 3:00 p.m. ET.

The 37-year-old dispatched the American in a quarterfinal match that was postponed from Wednesday night

At 37 years and 10 months, he's through to the incredible 79th Masters 1000 semifinal of his career at the Miami Open.

For many reasons, Nole should convincingly improve on an already lopsided head-to-head.

Arthur Fils' three-set upset of top seed Alexander Zverev, and Grigor Dimitrov's marathon win, contributed to the schedule backlog.

The second half of the Sunshine Swing features bright colors, custom accessories and national pride.

It's an uphill quarterfinal match for the American, but it doesn't mean he's out of the running.

The Serbian went on a nine-game run and booked a quarterfinal spot with a 6-2, 6-2 rout of Lorenzo Musetti.

Stream live on TennisChannel.com at approximately 3:10 p.m. ET on Tuesday.

They've always played close matches. Will the Italian close the door?

The six-time Miami champ heaped praise on the young Brazilian, who has already made waves on his way to the third round.

Before each day's play at the Miami Open, we'll break down three must-see matches.

The world No. 3 says he was unaware there would be a class-action lawsuit filed by the PTPA in U.S. federal court—despite being quoted in the filing.

Presented by BetMGM. Draper's going for the Double, Alcaraz is the favorite.

The PTPA called the women's and men's tours, the ITF and the ITIA a ""cartel, while the four major events—Wimbledon, US Open, French Open and Australian Open—were classed as ""co-conspirators"".

The group said it met with more than 250 players—women and men, and a majority of the top 20 in the WTA and ATP rankings—before going to court.

Plus: Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic face off against in-form Americans.

A surprising confession followed a puzzling performance by the five-time champion.
