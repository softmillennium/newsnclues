                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It comes following criticism of French Open organisers who featured no women's matches in any of the 11 prime-time night sessions on Court Philippe Chatrier this year. WTA chief executive officer Portia Archer says she expects to meet Roland Garros tournament director Amelie Mauresmo to see how they can "effect change" - but said she does not believe the issue lies with any individual. "I just think it's a missed opportunity," Archer told BBC Sport. "I think their [TV] rights partners may very well have a role to play in this, and have something to say on behalf of fans as well." But during this year's tournament, former WTA world number one Mauresmo rejected accusations that not scheduling women's matches in the tournament's night session implies female players are not "worthy" of the slot. That came after three-time major finalist Ons Jabeur said that the continuing imbalance at the French Open was "unfortunate for women's sports in general". Archer said: "I thought Ons shared a very eloquent message. "I think we'll have conversations with Grand Slams and various events who are operating in what we believe is a way that's different to what the fans and the public demand. It is something that we will continue to push for and continue to advocate for - it's in our DNA at the WTA." "I think it is an issue at other tournaments, I don't think it is an issue specific to the Grand Slams." On whether she will seek to discuss the issue with Mauresmo, Archer added: "I think I'll have an opportunity to do that. "Again, it's not something that I assign to a specific individual, so we'll be working to discuss with all the relevant parties how we can effect change in this area."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis legend Boris Becker recently sparked debate on social media when he disagreed with a list of the greatest Grand Slam finals shared on X. Federer defeated Roddick after four hours and 17 minutes with 5‚Äì7, 7‚Äì6(8‚Äì6), 7‚Äì6(7‚Äì5), 3‚Äì6, 16‚Äì14 at the 2009 Wimbledon final. This was one of the most significant parts of their rivalry as they were against each other for the third time in a Wimbledon final and the fourth time in a Grand Slam final. One notable thing from this match was that Roddick lost after holding serve for 37 straight games. My top 5 Grand Slam men's finals of all time: Federer, aged 35, returned from a six-month injury break. Neither player had reached a Grand Slam final in years, which made the match even more remarkable. After winning this match, Federer regained the World No.1 ranking and clinched his 18th Grand Slam title, making this match even memorable. Don't agree with Wimbledon finale 2012 between Federer v Roddick ! I did the commentary for the BBC , it was very long but few good rallies‚Ä¶ I would include Melbourne 2017 between Roger& Rafa , scintillating tennis üéæ 5 sets and proper comeback! Becker praised this match as ‚Äúscintillating tennis‚Äù featuring five sets and a ‚Äúproper comeback.‚Äù The match lasted more than four hours and showcased both players' tactical skills despite their advancing ages. The discussion about grand finals gained relevance after the recent French Open final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. The five-hour and 29-minute battle between these two players was an instant classic. The Spaniard won the match by making a comeback from being two sets down to lifting his second consecutive French Open title. This was the first time Alcaraz won a match after being two sets down. The 2017 Australian Open final between Federer and Nadal delivered, featuring two legends producing magic late in their careers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The young star in a grueling five-set final at Roland Garros on Sunday, successfully defending his title. With 20 ATP Tour titles and five Grand Slams under his belt, Alcaraz's total prize money is estimated to be around $44.7M. His recent French Open win also allowed him to surpass Pete Sampras, who reportedly earned just over $43M before retiring in 2002. According to the official ATP site, Alcaraz has already raked in $6.8M this year alone, boasting four titles and an impressive record of 37 wins and five losses. His most lucrative season so far was in 2023 when he ended the year with a whopping $15.1M in earnings, a year that also saw him clinch his first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon by defeating Novak Djokovic. However, if Alcaraz aims to surpass Djokovic's best single-season earnings this year, he still has a long way to go. And with Djokovic still in top form, it's likely he'll continue to add to this impressive total. Alcaraz is set to increase his earnings when he returns to Wimbledon this summer, aiming for a third consecutive victory in London. While the exact prize money for this year's Grand Slam remains unknown, Alcaraz reportedly pocketed $3.6M from the event last year. At just 22, Alcaraz has ample time to catch up with the 'Big Four'. The same goes for Sinner, who currently sits behind Sampras with his $41.5M earnings but ahead of Stan Wawrinka, who completes the current top 10 with $37.6M. Wimbledon takes place in London between June 30 and July 13, while the U.S. Open lands at the UTSA Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre in New York between August 24 and September 7.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There, Krejcikova beat Jasmine Paolini in three sets 6-2, 2-6, 6-4, to lift the Venus Rosewater Dish for the first time in her career. Well, things haven't quite gone to plan for Krejcikova recently‚Ä¶ Beating Paolini in the 2024 final, Krejcikova clinched her second Major title, having won Roland Garros three years earlier. Carrying that winning momentum home with her, Krejcikova partnered up with Katerina Siniakova at the Prague Open, where they won the doubles tournament two weeks after her Wimbledon triumph. It was there that the winning stopped for Krejcikova, as she endured a torrid end to her 2024 campaign, winning just four more matches. Hoping to bounce back in 2025, the two-time Major winner suffered another setback when Krejcikova withdrew from the Australian Open with a back injury. Returning to winning ways, Krejcikova won her first round match at the French Open, beating Tatjana Maria. Given the year that she's had since winning Wimbledon in 2024, it's not hard to understand why she's being overlooked as a contender for this year's title. The likes of Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff, and Madison Keys have all impressed in 2025 and will be tough to beat on the grass, whereas Krejcikova has played just three matches. If the odds weren't already stacked against her, she'll have to break a seven-year curse of failed Wimbledon title defences if she wants to pick up her third Grand Slam title next month. Serena and Venus Williams are the only two players to have defended the women's Wimbledon title this Century, doing so on multiple occasions. However, since Serena Williams won back-to-back titles in 2015 and 2016, no player has been able to defend the sole grass-court Major. The title has proven difficult to win and even harder to retain over recent years, as the likelihood is we will see another first-time champion in 2025. Krejcikova will kick off her Queen's campaign against Slovakia's Rebecca Sramkova in the first round on Tuesday, June 10.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu thrashed qualifier Cristina Bucsa 6-1, 6-2 as she began her singles campaign at Queen's on Tuesday afternoon. The former US Open champion spoke of her love of small courts after her box-office doubles partnership with Katie Boulter was buried on Court One on Monday due to television rights obligations, but she looked more than at home on the newly named Andy Murray Arena. So comfortable, in fact, that looming concerns over a back injury suffered in the build-up appeared a world away on Tuesday afternoon, as Raducanu had as an easy a time as her compatriot Boulter had toiled against Ajla Tomljanovic in the earlier match. While Bucsa does not register as one of her most fearsome opponents to date, the world No116 was unable to lay a glove on Raducanu - who, if she can make a deep run at The Queen's Club, could go into Wimbledon as British No1 again. Raducanu looked particularly confident at pace, claiming the first break of the match with a lightly popped backhand volley that Bucsa, mercilessly dragged across all four corners of the court, hadn't a hope of reaching. Raducanu will now look ahead to facing either Barbora Krejcikova or Rebecca Sramkova Another on-the-run forehand and a string of flashing baseline winners made Bucsa look out of place wherever she positioned herself, with Raducanu sprinting to the finish of the opening set as if she had a train to catch. When Raducanu plays like this, it can be a challenge not to get carried away thinking of her miraculous rise to prominence. Should she ever hope to match that undreamed-of US Open win, beating a doubles specialist who has gone through two rounds of qualifying like Bucsa will only be the first step of many, but you can only play the opponent in front of you. Bucsa's first hold for some time was hard fought, but after an exchange of advantages, the Spaniard could walk back to her chair after the game with her head a little higher after serving up a zippy ace to finally claim it. But a remontada this was not; although Bucsa had Raducanu beaten after pushing her into a deep cross-court backhand before wafting a drop shot into acres of empty court for 30-30, and proved nettlesome as Raducanu's service level briefly dropped. Raducanu may have tried to play down British hopes with warnings of her 'pretty low expectations' in west London, but she will have a harder time convincing Tuesday's crowd after performances like this.

Jannik Sinner not only fell just one step, specifically one point, short of winning his first Roland Garros, but he also came very close to achieving a milestone that had never been done before, but at least he can take comfort in having equalled a legend like Pete Sampras. The thing is, when the Italian secured the second set of the final, he linked 11 consecutive sets in Grand Slam finals (Australian Open 2023 (3), 2024 (3), and US Open 2024 (3), Roland Garros 2025 (2)). Alcaraz broke this streak by taking the third set and then the fourth and fifth, but Sinner tied in this statistic with Sampras, who also amassed 11 consecutive sets (Wimbledon 1993 (1), US Open 1993 (3), Australian Open 1993 (3), Wimbledon 1994 (3), and Australian Open 1995 (1)).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NICK KYRGIOS has been axed from the BBC's coverage of Wimbledon for 2025, according to reports. Roughly a year earlier, the Australian had admitted to assaulting an ex-girlfriend. However, the tennis bad boy confirmed he would not be appearing because of a recurring injury. Taking to Instagram, he said: "Just wanted to give everyone a quick update ‚Äì l've hit a small setback in my recovery and unfortunately won't make it back for grass season this year. "I know how much you've all been looking forward to seeing me out there, and I'm genuinely sorry to disappoint. "This is just a bump in the road though, and I'm already working hard to get back stronger than ever. ‚ÄúThank you for all your continued support ‚Äì it means everything to me. Kyrgios will also not take up his usual punditry role on American broadcaster ESPN. His hiring by the BBC last year was met with criticism by senior MPs and women's campaigners. A BBC statement at the time said: "We are in no way condoning his cited previous actions or behaviours, on and off the court, and he is employed to share his views on tennis only. "He has provided similar services to other major sports broadcasters in recent months. "The legal process he was involved in has concluded, is well documented, and he has spoken about it publicly." Kyrgios admitted to assaulting ex-girlfriend, Chiara Passari, in February 2023. However, a magistrate in Canberra, Australia, said the incident - which happened in 2021 - was ‚Äúa single act of stupidity or frustration,‚Äù and spared him from getting a criminal record. THE absence of line judges at Wimbledon will be a sad sight. For as long as I can remember, the men and women decked out in their Ralph Lauren outfits have been part of the furniture at the All England Club. Yes, they provided some mild entertainment on the court when one would call "fault" with plenty of extra, and unnecessary, gusto and volume that boomed around Centre Court, prompting a snigger from the fans. Then there was the ongoing game of dodgeball they had to play when a big serve nailed a mammoth ace down the line and they had to take rapid evasive action or take a whack to the top of the head. Purely objectively, Wimbledon's decision to replace line judges with Hawk-Eye Live makes total sense. And Wimbledon's hand was somewhat forced to ditch tradition for their standing in tennis. The Australian Open and US Open already use electronic line calling and the ATP Tour is adopting Hawk-Eye Live across all of its tournaments from 2025. Wimbledon's refusal to comply would leave them lagging behind and exposed to the threat of needless controversy over human error. It is on the line judges themselves. Approximately 300 officials - aged from 18 to 80 - covered more than 650 matches at Wimbledon. A fraction travel internationally with the circuit but the vast majority of those are part-time line judges based in the UK, earning up to ¬£180 per day to work at the prestigious tournament and their chance to play their part at Wimbledon. Like football with referees, tennis needs umpires and line judges.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ROLAND GARROS, PARIS ‚Äî Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2) in the French Open final at Roland Garros on Sunday. 1 seed in an intense, fast-paced match that turned into a tennis psychodrama as it stretched into its sixth hour and evening fell across the Paris clay. It was ultimately decided by Sinner's dominance on short points, Alcaraz's newfound ability to impose his variety, and one of the greatest surges of the Spaniard's young career. The first major final between the two standout players in men's tennis enshrined this young rivalry's place in global sport, as they produced a classic that will hopefully go down as the first instalment in something epochal. It is Alcaraz's fifth Grand Slam title and his second at the French Open. This win is also the 22-year-old's first comeback from two sets to love down in his career. It takes their head-to-head to 8-4 in the Spaniard's favor and extends his winning streak over Sinner, 23, to five matches. The Athletic‚Äòs writers, Charlie Eccleshare and Matt Futterman, analyze the final and what it means for tennis. Instead, Sinner somehow found some extra reserves and took advantage of Alcaraz's nerves to break back to 15. When Sinner chased down a drop shot to earn the break points, Alcaraz hadn't even moved forward, so sure was he that he had won the point. Court Philippe-Chatrier was stunned, and from there the match descended into a stunning psychodrama that enshrined this young sporting rivalry's place in the global sporting world. None of this had seemed possible at the start of the set, when Sinner could barely move. It was as though he was back from the dead, just as Alcaraz had raised himself from two sets down. The match was back level and impossible to call again. Alcaraz got to deuce on Sinner's serve, but he couldn't get the break he needed, and so had to serve to stay in the match, having been serving for the title just minutes before. Sinner smashed a forehand at Alcaraz, but the Spaniard somehow got in the way of it with a volley for 15-0. Sinner responded and won the next two points ‚Äî the second an angled half-volley to make his rival blush ‚Äî to leave himself two points from the title. The same could be said of Alcaraz, who moved to 40-30 and avoided being championship point down again with a ridiculous forehand defensive shot followed by a flicked backhand winner. Even better was to come when Alcaraz, from deep behind the baseline, found the strength to rip a backhand passing shot away for a winner on the sharpest of angles. That took the match into a tiebreak and ended a three-game drama that transposed into one of the great surges of Alcaraz's career. Alcaraz got to an early lead with two big forehands across the court and a Sinner ball that flew long. Another forehand long from Sinner and Alcaraz was up 5-0, halfway home. Was there another escape for the Italian? A match that had been defined by Sinner's impossible floor, obliterating the ball with enough safety that it lands well inside the lines, had been stolen away from him. There was time for one final miracle from Alcaraz ‚Äî a running forehand down the line that was too ridiculous for words. Alcaraz collapsed into the clay, a champion again. The match seemed so lost, it was almost silly to consider what might happen when Alcaraz stepped to the line to serve at 0-40, 3-5 in the fourth set. The celebration in Italy was about to explode. He went long with a ground stroke. Interesting, but he had two more championship points and then, in reserve, a chance to serve it out. Alcaraz had his lifeline and whipped up the crowd, promising them more tennis if they could carry him to this most unlikely rise from the abyss. He has the bigger serve and induces more errors on return than most top players. Sinner's short-point edge quickly climbed to 38-14 over the first three games of the second set, when he took early command. Those numbers provided a nice snapshot of each player's strategy. Alcaraz wanted to get into points, especially on Sinner's serve. Sinner wanted to play first-strike tennis and avoid the points where Alcaraz controls his opponent like a puppeteer. The dichotomy on point length gave Alcaraz that opportunity, but given the effectiveness of Sinner's serve ‚Äî and the laws of elite tennis, in which short points make up the majority of points played ‚Äî Alcaraz's potential advantage was quickly wiped away. Sinner was playing over 60 percent of the match in a game state where he held an overwhelming advantage. It's no coincidence that during the peak of his domination, Sinner was winning 66 percent of points on his first serve, compared with a little under 60 percent for Alcaraz. Sinner switched from a platform (feet apart) stance in his serve to a pinpoint (feet together) launch two years ago. These two players are a level above the rest of the tour, evenly matched rivals in their own galaxy. Sinner was 108-95 on the 0-4 shot points; Alcaraz was 97-84 on anything longer than that ‚Äî a deficit of 13 each way erased to nothing. In his tiebreak surge, eight of the 12 points played were five shots or longer. Ask any player who has done it on the biggest stages in tennis. So much of beating Alcaraz lies in finding a way to snuff out the surges that he uses to steamroll an opponent, whether he's ahead or behind. On Sunday, the first surge came nearly two hours into a match that had turned into one-way traffic for Sinner, who was serving for a two-set lead at 5-3. But suddenly Alcaraz had a 0-30 lead and Court Philippe-Chatrier came alive for the first time. The fans were chanting Alcaraz's name, begging him to make this a match. Alcaraz obliged a couple of minutes later, pulling Sinner into two longer points, the kind that were going his way for most of the afternoon. Sinner got sloppy, committing two errors, giving Alcaraz and the match a breath of life. On the changeover, he pumped his fist to the crowd, as much for himself as for them. At one hour and 55 minutes, the set was tied. It seemed like the match had turned in 10 minutes. But Sinner got to this final by snuffing out a similar surge from Novak Djokovic ‚Äî and the crowd ‚Äî in the second set of their semifinal on Friday night. Alcaraz reverted to the errors, some on low-percentage shots, that had been plaguing him. Soon, the Italian was up two sets to one. It took longer to extinguish the next one, which started when Alcaraz broke Sinner in the third set for 3-1. It was a part of a four-game winning streak that Alcaraz rode to capturing the third set, and it lasted through the first half of the fourth. Alcaraz played his best tennis of the afternoon, sliding aces out of Sinner's reach and unleashing his forehand into open spaces. He slid a drop shot nearly parallel to the net to get within two points of a decisive break. He stood firm enough in the next two rallies to induce the errors from Alcaraz and looked to be on his way. Sinner pushed it to a tiebreak, but after falling 0-2 down, Alcaraz cranked out a couple of aces on his way to winning seven of the last eight points. With Sweet Caroline cranking on the sound system, Alcaraz ran to the crowd behind the baseline with his fist in the air as Sinner remained seated on his chair, trying to figure out some way to stifle all this. In the end, he found it, until the one last Alcaraz rise that proved impossible to quell. Alcaraz can maneuver the ball and change the cadence of a match like no other elite player. Some lower down the tour, such as Corentin Moutet and Alexander Bublik, are masters of disruption and improvization, but Alcaraz is the maestro. So perhaps Sinner's greatest achievement on Sunday was stopping that from happening for large swathes of the match. Sinner dictated the terms of play, ensuring that the match was a contest of intense, fast, but generally metronomic rallies. Alcaraz, usually the dictating player, was left trying to get his opponent out of his rhythm and fluctuate the patterns of play. He tried, but Sinner stayed tight to the baseline and played a match more typically seen on a hard court, the surface where Sinner is borderline unbeatable. By his own admission, it's the kind of tennis he's been playing all clay-court season, leaving defeated opponents in his wake. For the first two sets, Sinner's consistent hitting and aggressive court position prevented Alcaraz from getting on top of the rallies and bringing his lethal drop shot regularly into play. But as the match ticked into its fourth and fifth sets, Alcaraz took over. Alcaraz was swinging a tiring Sinner across the baseline and punishing him with inside-in drop shots. By the end, Alcaraz had hit more drop shots than during any other match in the tournament. Sinner is often compared to Djokovic for his style of tennis, but there's something about his mentality that also resembles the 24-time Grand Slam champion. But like Djokovic, Sinner is extremely adept at shrugging off disappointment to lock back in. He began the fourth set with renewed purpose, and though he missed a break point on Alcaraz's serve at 1-1, he was holding easily himself and keeping the pressure on his opponent. Alcaraz, knowing one misstep would almost certainly be terminal, lost his serve to love to give Sinner a 4-3 lead with another loose game. It is uncertain how much Sinner felt he had to get this done in four sets because of his lack of matches after a three-month suspension, and his poor record in long matches ‚Äî he was 6-9 in five-setters and had lost all six longer than three hours and 50 minutes before this final. Curiously, the clock ticked beyond three hours and 50 minutes while Sinner was serving for the match, which made the fact that Alcaraz had kept things competitive in the face of a second-set rout a couple of hours earlier seem significant. Coco Gauff said after beating Aryna Sabalenka in Saturday's women's final that extending the first set of their match had been an important factor in her ultimately outlasting the world No. Alcaraz certainly looked fresher than Sinner in the tiebreak. He went down 0-2, then up 4-2, conjuring memories of the Beijing Open final last fall, when Sinner led a tiebreak 3-0 before Alcaraz won it 7-3. From there, Sinner was at the point that his sprint for the line had been designed to avoid. Again, it proved the point of no return, just much later than anybody expected. I know the hard work you put in every day. It's a privilege to share the court with you. He also thanked his team and family, saying: ‚ÄúI have the privilege to live great things with you. ‚ÄúI was lucky to have a lot of friends from home, from Murcia, to support, throughout the whole two weeks. Special thank you to (tournament director) Amelie Mauresmo, congratulations as well, it's not easy to be with us. ‚ÄúIt's easier to play than talk now. To my team, thank you so much. Thank you to the organizers for making it such a special event. The support has been amazing these couple of weeks. (Top photo: Adam Pretty / AFP via Getty Images)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fresh from outlasting Jannik Sinner at the French Open in one of the greatest Grand Slam finals of all-time, Carlos Alcaraz will be looking to win at Wimbledon for the third successive year. Last year, a peak of 7.5 million people tuned into BBC One to see Alcaraz defeat Novak Djokovic in the final, with the match also streamed live 1.78 million times on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport online. Meanwhile during the ladies' singles final, where Barbora Krejcikova was victorious over Jasmine Paolini, there was a peak audience of 4.1 million on BBC One. That means that live coverage must be made available for free-to-air channels and the corporation duly go out over the two weeks. But the rule also allows paid networks to share live coverage, as long as it continues to be shown on terrestrial television. Eurosport chiefs signed a new five-year deal with the All England Club last year, having shown highlights of each day and live coverage of both finals since 2016. But with TNT Sports now falling under the Discovery umbrella, and Eurosport no more, Wimbledon heads onto TNT for the first time. On the BBC, the presenting line-up is yet to be confirmed, though two-time Wimbledon champion Andy Murray has been linked with a role as a pundit. His coaching partnership with Djokovic recently came to an end, opening the door to a broadcast role at the championships. His former mentee Djokovic will be looking to equal Roger Federer's all-time record of eight Wimbledon titles. The BBC are also making a key change for this year's championships. A test will be held during Wimbledon giving selected iPlayer beta users access to a low latency version of the BBC Two live stream. The test was announced in a BBC blog post, which explained the move will help the broadcaster ‚Äúassess how well low latency streaming approaches perform over today's internet into our viewer's homes.‚Äù Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Wimbledon winner Marion Bartoli gave Jannik Sinner's rivals one big tip on how to beat the world No 1 and Carlos Alcaraz heeded that advice during the French Open final. ‚Äú[But] we know that the 4:30 mark is a bit of a fatal bar for Sinner. Beyond that, he starts to get stuck physically, but we have to take him beyond 4:30 of play.‚Äù Bartoli's comment was backed up by statistics as Sinner has a poor record in long matches as at that point he had lost all six of his matches that were longer than three hours and 50 minutes. In case you were wondering, the 2024 Australian Open final against Daniil Medvedev lasted three hours and 44 minutes. Six defeats became seven after the Roland Garros final against Alcaraz as that also went the distance. Jannik Sinner has one ‚Äòfatal' weakness that a brutal statistic confirms French Open ATP Winners & Losers: Alcaraz's joy, Sinner's heartbreak‚Ä¶and a Djokovic farewell? The Italian is now 6-10 in matches that have gone to a fifth set and he has lost eight of his last nine Grand Slam matches that have gone to a decider. Three of those defeats have come against Alcaraz while Novak Djokovic, Alexander Zverev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Medvedev and Daniel Altmaier have also claimed wins. Sinner was asked about fading physically late during long matches following his devastating loss to Alcaraz in Paris. ‚ÄúNo, you cannot compare this match with other matches, I believe,‚Äù he said. You can't really change it. ‚ÄúI'm still happy to be part of this match. You know, we saw it in the past with other players, and today it happened to me. After Alcaraz and Sinner's French Open epic, we rank the best Grand Slam men's finals of the Open Era. Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner's amazing battle gripped the tennis world. ¬© Planet Sport Limited 2025 ‚Ä¢ All Rights Reserved</p>
