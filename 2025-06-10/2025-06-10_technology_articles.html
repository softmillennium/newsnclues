                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first pair of commercial augmented reality glasses to sport Google's newfangled Android XR aren't merely a wearable computer you can slip on and off with ease. Xreal's Project Aura glasses still aren't available, but the bare details about the device's specs offer a better idea of what the first pair of true AR glasses may look like—when and if you can actually buy them. While we all hoped we could simply tether our AR glasses to an Android device, you can expect that today's phones won't be enough to handle all the 3D and AI goodness packed inside. At Augmented World Expo (AWE) on Tuesday, Xreal revealed a few scant details about its device that was already lacking much in the way of specifics. Instead, the AR glasses maker finally revealed that Aura won't be processing data on the glasses itself. It will instead use a separate, tethered, puck-like device that sits in your pocket. Additionally, Xreal finally offered some insight into what's powering its new device. The puck will house a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip. Simply put, your phone isn't built for handling the same tasks, according to Xreal. Meta's Project Orion was the first AR prototype device announced so far that requires a similar “compute puck.” The need for an extra processing puck leaves me questioning whether these devices will have the battery capacity necessary for heavy use for more than a few hours. Xreal didn't offer details about battery life, though at least it confirmed the glasses will have front-facing sensors with added hand tracking, akin to the Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro. Xreal offered more about the displays it's using in Aura. That's a relatively wide FOV for a pair of AR glasses, far more than the 57-degree FOV of the Xreal One Pro, and it should offer something much closer to the experience of wearing a full VR headset, at least on the horizontal axis. These glasses are built with many of the same apps as Project Moohan in mind. We've only seen a few short demos with Samsung's XR device and how it works in concert with Google's Gemini AI. Moohan should be able to operate most Android apps, but it can also add 3D functionality to apps like Google Maps. Gizmodo had the opportunity to try a different pair of Android XR glasses at last month's Google I/O, though that truncated demo paled in comparison to the navigation and memory capabilities Google has previously shown to the public. Xreal hasn't offered any indication of a release date or price, but we can only assume it will be a while, and it will be very expensive. A pair of $300 Ray-Ban Meta or similar smart glasses will still be far slimmer without the need for wired connections. Those devices aren't exactly cheap, but we'll have to see if consumers are truly ready for a device that costs closer to $1,000 just for the sake of having a tiny heads-up display on their spectacles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As hundreds of United States Marines deploy in Los Angeles under presidential orders to protect federal property amid growing protests over immigration enforcement, constitutional scholars and civil rights attorneys warn of long-term implications for American democracy and civil-military relations. LA residents responded after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents carried out sweeping raids of local businesses, arresting, among others, dozens of day laborers who were vying for work outside a local Home Depot. Larger demonstrations soon formed and remained largely peaceful until residents were engaged by police with riot shields and crowd control weapons. Videos captured by protest attendees show police firing upon demonstrators with rubber bullets and other crowd control agents, including waves of asphyxiating CS gas. California governor Gavin Newsom condemned Trump's troop deployment in posts on social media, calling the president's actions an “unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.” His attorney general, Rob Bonta, has filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming the order violated the state's sovereignty, infringing on Newsom's authority as the California National Guard's commander in chief. In response to a request for comment, the Department of Defense referred WIRED to a US Northern Command press release detailing the deployment of Marines and National Guardsmen. This rule, known as “posse comitatus,” may be suspended, however, by a sitting president in cases of civil unrest or outright rebellion. This exception—permitted under the Insurrection Act—allows the president to deploy troops when circumstances make it “impracticable” for state authorities to enforce federal law by “ordinary” means. This interpretation of presidential power finds that troops may be deployed in an effort to “protect federal property and functions.” Notably—unlike the Insurrection Act—this does not permit troops to engage in activities that are generally the purview of civilian law enforcement agencies. Trump also invoked statutory power granted to him by Congress under Title 10 of the US Code, which enabled him to federalize elements of California's National Guard. These activations typically occur when guardsmen are needed to support overseas military operations, as happened routinely this century during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Legal experts interviewed by WIRED offered a range of opinions on the president's authority to deploy active-duty military troops or federalize the National Guard. While most believe it is likely within Trump's power to ignore Newsom's express objections, doing so without an invocation of the Insurrection Act, they say, is a decision fraught with legal complexities that carries serious implications, from altering—perhaps permanently—the fundamental relationship between Americans, states, and the federal government, to disturbing the delicate balance between civilian governance and military power. A key issue for Goitein is that the memorandum signed by Trump last week federalizing the National Guard makes no mention of Los Angeles or California. Rather, it states that the guardsmen are being mobilized to address protests that are both “occurring” and “likely to occur.” Goitein argues that the administration's justifications could undermine both judicial accountability and civil‑military boundaries. But without it, their authority should be quite limited. “But it looks a lot like quelling civil unrest.” Anthony Kuhn, a 28-year US Army veteran and managing partner at Tully Rinckey, believes, meanwhile, that there is really “no question” that Trump would be justified in declaring a “violent rebellion” underway in California, empowering him to ignore Newsom's objections. But at this point,” says Kuhn, “it's a violent rebellion. In contrast, Rutgers University professor Bruce Afran says deploying military forces against Americans is “completely unconstitutional” in the absence of a true state of domestic insurrection. And we have civil means to punish it without the armed forces.” Afran argues that meddling with the expectations of civilians, who naturally anticipate interacting with police but not armed soldiers, can fundamentally alter the relationship between citizens and their government, even blurring the line between democracy and authoritarianism. “And once we accept that new paradigm—to use a kind of BS word—the relationship between the citizen and the government is altered forever.” “Violent rioters in Los Angeles, enabled by Democrat governor Gavin Newsom, have attacked American law enforcement, set cars on fire, and fueled lawless chaos," Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, tells WIRED. "President Trump rightfully stepped in to protect federal law enforcement officers. When Democrat leaders refuse to protect American citizens, President Trump will always step in.” David Coombs, a lecturer in criminal procedure and military law at the University of Buffalo and a veteran of the US Army's Judge Advocate General's Corps, says it's hypothetically possible that troops could question whether Trump has the authority to mobilize state guardsmen over the objection of a state governor. “I think ultimately the answer to that will be yes,” he says. Separately, says Coombs, when troops are ordered to mobilize, they could—again, hypothetically—refuse to engage in activities that are beyond the scope of the president's orders, such as carrying out immigration raids or making arrests. “All they can do in this case, under Title 10 status, is protect the safety of federal personnel and property. If you go beyond that, then it violates the Posse Comitatus Act.” Federal troops, for instance, would need civilian police to step in at the point that local authorities want peaceful protesters to disperse. The San Francisco Chronicle reports that, in a letter on Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem requested that military troops be directed to detain alleged “lawbreakers” during protests “or arrest them,” which legal experts almost universally agree would be illegal under ordinary circumstances. The letter was addressed to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and accused the anti-ICE protesters of being “violent, insurrectionist mobs” aiming to “protect invaders and military aged males belonging to identified foreign terrorist organizations.” “It's not going to be litigated in the middle of an actual deployment,” he says. Khun says that were he deployed into a similar situation, “me and my junior soldiers would not respond to a nonviolent or peaceful protest.” Asked what protesters should expect, should they engage with federal troops trained for combat overseas, Kuhn says the Marines will hold their ground more firmly than police, who are often forced to retreat as mobs approach. “I would expect a defensive response,” he says, “but not lethal force.” Updated at 1:40 pm ET, June 10, 2025: Added clarifying language around the less-lethal shooting of Lauren Tomasi and fixed a typo in the California attorney general's name.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Great news for fans of Godzilla Minus One: the chonky kaiju icon from Takashi Yamazaki's Academy Award-winning feature will finally be released in Funko Pop form. The Big G's U.S. counterpart series from Legendary got a run of Funkos timed to Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, but Godzilla Minus One was left out until now. At last, the version of Godzilla seen in Toho's hit international film will join the Funko toy market this summer, giving collectors something to add to their Godzilla Minus One displays alongside Super 7's incredibly articulated statues, one in color and another in black and white, which we loved. The vinyl collectible features the iconic Toho monster and showcases his formidable presence inspired by Yamazaki's take on Godzilla. It stands approximately 5.4 inches (13.7 cm) tall, alongside the rest of the kaiju's various Funko forms from all his other universes of media. This release also features a new form of authentication, with a special sticker on the box that's unique and cannot be replicated. The Funko Pop Super Godzilla Minus One figure will first be available for purchase (retail price is $20) at the Funko booth during Anime Expo 2025 in Los Angeles, starting at 9 a.m. PT on July 3. It will also be available online in the future (date TBD) on Funko's website.

Reports from r/TEAMEVGA and other forums indicate a growing concern regarding boot-up problems with newer RTX 50 GPUs on motherboards from EVGA. The problem lies with extra SMBUS pins on several EVGA motherboards, which create a conflict when paired with GPUs from Nvidia. Without official support, users have resorted to an ingenious fix: physically taping over the pins on the GPU's PCIe connector to silence any unwanted communication, and thus far, this solution has proven successful for several individuals. Citing conflicts with Nvidia, EVGA withdrew from the GPU market in 2022 and scaled back its other business operations considerably. It's likely not a matter of malicious intent, but rather a consequence of EVGA's drastic scale-down, which means they likely don't have enough resources to dedicate to software, assuming those teams still even exist. According to the Redditor, their EVGA Z690 Classified includes SMBUS pins in the PCIe slot (pins 5 and 6), which are generally left unwired in most consumer-grade alternatives. It's highly possible that Nvidia's RTX 50 GPUs likely don't expect or cannot handle an SMBUS connection, which effectively halts the system from booting up. "EVGA is a shadow of its former self and getting BIOS updates for hardware compatibility issues is like pulling teeth," one lamented, "They've basically left their customers out to dry in regards to their motherboards." "EVGA is a shadow of its former self and getting BIOS updates for hardware compatibility issues is like pulling teeth. Even if disabling these pins through firmware were an option, EVGA's support has shrunk to Reddit forums, likely mirroring the state of their software teams. It is a bit finicky, requiring great precision to ensure only those specific pins are blocked, but it works nonetheless. It is important to note this isn't a widespread issue, since other EVGA motherboards, including some Z690 models and most Z790 models, reportedly remain unaffected. We haven't heard anything official from EVGA on the matter, at least not yet. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

At the same site, you can find the complete set of NIRCam and MIRI mosaics and tiles, plus a full photometric catalog. To help Joe Public make sense of this 1.5TB data deluge, COSMOS-Web has thoughtfully provided a full aperture and model-based photometric catalog. Using this reference, those interested can observe “photometry, structural measurements, redshifts, and physical parameters for nearly 800,000 galaxies.” More excitingly for amateur astrophysics enthusiasts, the researchers claim that the new JWST imaging, combined with previous COSMOS data, “opens many unexplored scientific avenues.” Before you head on over to the linked resources, it might be useful to familiarize yourself with some of the terms and units used by COSMOS-Web. If we want to look more closely at the JWST NIRCam mosaics, for example, you will see that the newly surveyed area is mapped into 20 zones with reference codes. Each of the mosaics is available in four NIRCam filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W). ‘Mas' is short for milliarcseconds, a unit of angular measurement commonly used in astronomy. Both mosaics (created by stitching together multiple tiles), and tiles (individual images, as captured by the telescope) are available for download and study. You would also need specialized astronomical software to open these FITS data maps, but there are many options available, including some free and open-source software. It began with its use of the Hubble Space Telescope to cover what has now become known as the COSMOS field, a 2-square-degree field which appears to cover approximately 2 million galaxies. Ultimately, it is hoped that the research team will be able to study the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. grocery distribution giant United Natural Foods (UNFI) said on Tuesday it is working to restore its capabilities following a cyberattack last week that continues to disrupt the grocery supply chain. The company is “helping our customers with short-term solutions wherever possible,” said UNFI chief executive Sandy Douglas in prepared remarks. On the company's post-results conference call, Douglas said UNFI is “continuing to safely bring our systems back online and restore broad-based customer service as soon as possible.” The company, which is the primary distributor for Amazon-owned Whole Foods, and supplies over 250,000 grocery store products, including frozen goods, disclosed on Monday that it had identified unauthorized access to its IT systems. One customer of UNFI told TechCrunch that they are trialing a new product in Whole Foods stores this week, but said much of their supply had not been delivered. TechCrunch has heard anecdotal reports of diminished or empty shelves at some stores affected by the disruption at UNFI, but it is not immediately clear if this is due to the cyberattack or other supply chain issues. Much of the downstream real-world impact on grocery stores and their customers may not be seen until later this week. Whole Foods has not returned a request for comment from TechCrunch. Much of the UNFI's external-facing systems are offline, including web systems used by suppliers and customers, as well as the company's VPN products, according to checks by TechCrunch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A data broker owned by the country's major airlines, including Delta, American Airlines, and United, collected US travelers' domestic flight records, sold access to them to Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and then as part of the contract told CBP to not reveal where the data came from, according to internal CBP documents obtained by 404 Media. The data includes passenger names, their full flight itineraries, and financial details. This article was created in partnership with 404 Media, a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. CBP, a part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), says it needs this data to support state and local police to track people of interest's air travel across the country, in a purchase that has alarmed civil liberties experts. “The big airlines—through a shady data broker that they own called ARC—are selling the government bulk access to Americans' sensitive information, revealing where they fly and the credit card they used,” senator Ron Wyden said in a statement. ARC is owned and operated by at least eight major US airlines, other publicly released documents show. More than 240 airlines depend on ARC for ticket settlement services. ARC's other lines of business include being the conduit between airlines and travel agencies, finding travel trends in data with other firms like Expedia, and fraud prevention, according to material on ARC's YouTube channel and website. A Statement of Work included in the newly obtained documents, which describes why an agency is buying a particular tool or capability, says CBP needs access to ARC's TIP product “to support federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to identify persons of interest's US domestic air travel ticketing information.” 404 Media obtained the documents through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The new documents obtained by 404 Media also show ARC asking CBP to “not publicly identify vendor, or its employees, individually or collectively, as the source of the Reports unless the Customer is compelled to do so by a valid court order or subpoena and gives ARC immediate notice of same.” The Statement of Work says that TIP can show a person's paid intent to travel and tickets purchased through travel agencies in the US and its territories. They add that this data will be “crucial” in both administrative and criminal cases. A DHS Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) available online says that TIP data is updated daily with the previous day's ticket sales, and contains more than one billion records spanning 39 months of past and future travel. The document says TIP can be searched by name, credit card, or airline, but ARC contains data from ARC-accredited travel agencies, such as Expedia, and not flights booked directly with an airline. WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. “While obtaining domestic airline data—like many other transaction and purchase records—generally doesn't require a warrant, there's still supposed to go through a legal process that ensures independent oversight and limits data collection to records that will support an investigation,” Jake Laperruque, deputy director of the Center for Democracy & Technology's Security and Surveillance Project, told 404 Media in an email. “As with many other types of sensitive and revealing data, the government seems intent on using data brokers to buy their way around important guardrails and limits.” The CBP contract 404 Media obtained documents for was an $11,025 transaction. Last Tuesday, a public procurement database added a $6,847.50 update to that contract, which said it was exercising “Option Year 1,” meaning it was extending the contract. CBP follows a robust privacy policy as we protect the homeland through the air, land and maritime environments against illegal entry, illicit activity or other threats to national sovereignty and economic security,” a CBP spokesperson said in a statement. CBP added that the data is only used when an OPR investigation is open, and the agency needs to locate someone related to that investigation. The agency says the data can act as a good starting point to identify a relevant flight record before then getting more information through legal processes. On May 1, ICE published details about its own ARC data purchase. In response, on May 2, 404 Media filed FOIA requests with ICE and a range of other agencies that 404 Media found had bought ARC's services, including CBP, the Secret Service, SEC, DEA, the Air Force, US Marshals Service, TSA, and ATF. “ARC has refused to answer oversight questions from Congress, so I have already contacted the major airlines that own ARC—like Delta, American Airlines, and United—to find out why they gave the green light to sell their customers' data to the government,” Wyden's statement added. US law enforcement agencies have repeatedly turned to private companies to buy data rather than obtain it through legal processes such as search warrants or subpoenas. Clearly it's time for Congress to step in again, and stop the data broker loophole from being used to circumvent that ban,” he added. According to ARC's website, the company only introduced multifactor authentication on May 15.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dutch payments firm Adyen now has a market cap of over $61 billion, but that didn't stop its co-founder Arnout Schuijff from stepping down in 2021 to focus on his new startup, Tebi. Now an Amsterdam-based fintech startup with 35 employees, Tebi helps restaurants, bars and other hospitality businesses manage their operations with an all-in-one subscription-based platform that can handle payments, reservations, inventory, and more. This means that Tebi has a wealth of competitors, from POS systems to reservation platforms and analytics-driven solutions for inventory optimization. But it hopes to have an advantage by tying this all together with enterprise-level functionalities and pricing. To a casual observer, this appears as something that Adyen could have done. “That was a much more logical step for me than to try and do it within the context of Adyen.” However, Tebi wasn't meant to fill a gap left by Adyen. Nor was it meant to find a new role for Schuijff, who had stayed in his CTO role after the 2018 IPO that made him a billionaire, at least on paper. Using streaming, he was able to support instant transaction updates — and it grabbed him. But more generally, he saw the need for less manual reconciliation work. This was also confirmed to him by bar owner Mazdak Nasori, who became one of Tebi's five co-founders. Eventually, Schuijff told Adyen CEO Pieter van der Does he would leave to focus on Tebi full-time. When he goes out to eat or have a drink, Schuijff can't help talking to owners about their pain points, checking what they are using, and introducing Tebi. Still, joining forces with former Adyen EVP of Technology Rob Vonk as Tebi's CTO made for a tech-heavy team that needed balancing, Schuijff said. So he also hired Aki Tas as COO, who was formerly head of business strategy and operations at Notion, and recruited Patrick Studener, formerly COO at Wolt, as CCO. After using a hyperlocal deployment approach Tebi is now available across the Netherlands, where it says merchants are already processing nine figures of payments annually on the platform. Although San Francisco-based, CapitalG partner Alex Nichols is a really thesis-driven investor who also has Europe on his radar. He sought out Tebi after observing that European SMBs are underserved by costly, bank-dominated payment solutions. “This setup closely resembles the U.S. market 15 years ago before the rise of software-embedded payments reduced bank share to less than 30%” he told TechCrunch in a written comment. That Nichols had done his research was what ultimately won CapitalG the deal, in addition to all the “touch points” between Tebi and Alphabet properties such as Android, Gemini, Google Cloud, and Google Maps. The money in question will fund more than Tebi's international expansion. “The future vision,” Schuijff said, is that on top of its all-in-one platform, there will be “an AI platform that will help you run your business better.” Building this vision and expanding across Europe will take Tebi's bandwidth for a while. But after that, and “as soon as we are confident that we can grab a significant part of the market there,” a U.S. expansion is in the cards.

Nvidia's rumored N1X SoC has surfaced on Geekbench, rivaling the best mobile offerings from Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm, via Olrak at X. The alleged 20-core chip has hit over 3,000 single-core points on Geekbench, with multi-core performance nearing AMD's leading Strix Halo line. Nvidia has reportedly partnered with MediaTek, which is expected to handle the CPU development of this SoC using off-the-shelf Arm Cortex cores. Before jumping into performance, it's generally not advisable to compare CPUs across different Operating Systems and Geekbench releases. So, I've listed a few relevant CPU samples, noting their OS and Geekbench version. The alleged N1X scores 3,096 points and 18,837 points in single-core and multi-core territories, respectively, with the frequency averaging out at 4 GHz. Even with varying environments, its performance is well within the range of top chips like Intel's Arrow Lake-HX and AMD's Ryzen AI MAX (Strix Halo). It even trumps Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite; that's expected since the X Elite uses Oryon V1 cores, which should be superseded by Oryon V3 with Snapdragon X2 SoCs next year. That being said, Apple still reigns supreme in Geekbench, with the M4 Max comfortably ahead by 30% (single-core). Nvidia shied away from announcing or even mentioning these chips at Computex last month, so we may be in for a 2026 debut. It's possible the company may be dedicating more resources to DGX Spark, hoping to make these mini-PCs available for purchase before the upcoming holiday season. Regardless, by next year, more competition is expected with AMD's rumored Sound Wave APUs and Qualcomm's X2 SoCs, in addition to Panther Lake from Intel.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Every couple of years, Bose and Sony trade blows in an effort to claim the title of the best noise-canceling headphones you can buy. Until recently, Bose's QuietComfort Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends) had the edge, offering world-crushing cancellation that bested Sony's still-great WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) and other top models from the likes of JBL, Sonos, and Apple. Now, Sony's back with its latest WH-1000 model, the predictably titled WH-1000XM6 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Starting with aesthetics, neither of these plastic-clad models stands out like Apple's iconic (and heavy) AirPods Max, but both manage to blaze their own trail to match premium pricing with a posh design. Sony's XM6 gets a refreshed plastic matte exterior that feels both grittier and more robust than its predecessor. Along with extra style points, the new design rectifies one of the XM5's biggest detractions with a new hinge point along the arms that once again makes Sony's best wireless headphones foldable for travel. Bose's pair applies more glitz than the understated XM6, highlighted by sleek curves, a more sumptuous protein leather coating along the pads, and speckled metallic armpieces that grip smaller earcups. Though you'll miss out on the zipperless lid, when it comes to a more premium look and fit, Bose's pair takes this category. Both pairs are loaded with flagship features, including conveniences like multipoint pairing, auto-pause sensors, and replaceable earpads. Each model includes a loaded app for tinkering and customizing features like adaptive noise canceling and transparency modes, among multiple other parameters, and both opt for analog audio input rather than USB-C playback from their charging ports. Bose has its specialties, including a more accessible and intuitive app layout. Sony's app is more complicated but also provides more ways to explore and adapt, like a multiband EQ that goes well beyond Bose's three-band version. Bose's QC Ultra pack their own control innovations, including a handy new volume slider pad that's accurate enough to dial in your levels without blasting your ears. The other controls are less convenient due to their reliance on a two-button solution that puts a lot of weight on the multi-key. It's not a massive difference, but Sony's mix of simpler controls and deeper, more granular features gives its pair a leg up in usability. Before digging in here, it's important to note that both of these pairs offer noise canceling that bests everything we've ever tested. With a total of 12 microphones and an advanced new chipset, Sony claims its latest headphones have the best noise canceling on the market. When A/B testing without music, this was difficult to prove. Both are fantastic at removing low-end sounds like my go-to Airplane drone video, while effectively quelling high-register sounds like keystrokes, vacuums, and vocal chatter. What's immediately obvious is how much faster the XM6 works to kill sound, giving them an edge in some key areas. Where Bose's pair slowly squashes noises as it analyzes them over time, the XM6 react almost instantly to everything from passing cars to my electric leaf blower. As Wired editor Parker Hall pointed out, the XM6's faster response time also aids their noise canceling in the way most people listen, with music playing, by adjusting the output in real time with your tunes. In testing with light music playing, Sony's pair did seem to offer a slight advantage over the Ultra, especially with sharper annoyances like my ever-vigilant barking dog. Even so, both pairs are so powerful that a little music puts you in the void from virtually all sounds anyway. Transparency mode, the diametric opposite of noise canceling, is similarly close, but again, Sony's faster response time enhances performance. Both pairs sound quite natural, but Sony's model reacted more effectively in real time to punchy sounds like the slamming of my back door or a loud clap, while Bose's pair takes longer to adapt. To their credit, the QC Ultra are the best sounding Bose headphones I've tested, serving up impressive balance, clarity, and vibrancy. Both models offer 3D upmixing for more immersive listening with available head-tracking, which keeps your music centered as though listening to a pair of speakers, but Sony's head-tracking is limited to Android devices only, while Bose's pair works for either device type. For stereo playback, Sony's XM6 provides a warmer overall sound signature that still takes care with the higher frequencies, allowing for more intimacy, breadth, and instrumental textures that burst through the mix. Horns, woodwinds, and percussion are particularly gorgeous, with a lyrical, sometimes flinty brilliance that always steers clear of sharpness. It's taut and poised while still letting loose with some extra thump that blends studio-style precision with some playful buzz and grit. Both models offer sound quality worthy of their price tags, but Sony's deeper dive into the details hooked me in the first few minutes and never let go. Both pairs fared well across a number of calls between friends and colleagues. It's always hard to judge calling accurately given factors like crappy Zoom calls or dodgy cell connections, but I had no trouble with either pair on my end, and everyone I talked to said they could hear me clearly, even in crowded areas. Another slight strength for Sony, you'll get a max of around 30 hours of playback with noise canceling, just like the XM5, while Bose's pair offers a max of 24 hours with ambient modes engaged. The answer here may seem obvious, with Sony's WH-1000XM6 taking more categories. For my money, their mix of great usability, improved sound quality, and instantly vaporizing noise cancellation makes them the wireless headphones to beat. With better comfort, great sound, and similarly fabulous noise canceling, they remain top contenders. They also debuted at a lower price (though it's now in line with Sony on Bose's site) and can often be found on sale. Either way, you're getting insanely good noise canceling that bests everything else we've tested.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>IBM announced detailed plans today to build an error-corrected quantum computer with significantly more computational capability than existing machines by 2028. “We've already started building the space,” says Jay Gambetta, vice president of IBM's quantum initiative. IBM claims Starling will be a leap forward in quantum computing. If Starling achieves this, IBM will have solved arguably the biggest technical hurdle facing the industry today to beat competitors including Google, Amazon Web Services, and smaller startups such as Boston-based QuEra and PsiQuantum of Palo Alto, California. Rapid advances in applying artificial intelligence to simulations in physics and chemistry have some people questioning whether we will even need quantum computers at all. But Gambetta thinks it has an edge because it has all the building blocks to build error correction capabilities in a large-scale machine. That means improvements in everything from algorithm development to chip packaging. Whereas classical computers encode information in the form of bits, or binary 1 and 0, quantum computers instead use qubits, which can represent “superpositions” of both values at once. IBM builds qubits made of tiny superconducting circuits, kept near absolute zero, in an interconnected layout on chips. Quantum computers sometimes commit errors, such as when the hardware operates on one qubit but accidentally also alters a neighboring qubit that should not be involved in the computation. Without error correction, quantum computers cannot accurately perform the complex algorithms that are expected to be the source of their scientific or commercial value, such as extremely precise chemistry simulations for discovering new materials and pharmaceutical drugs. AI can help discover new materials, but we'll need quantum computers to really move the needle. Currently, quantum computing researchers are competing to develop the best error correction scheme. Google's surface code algorithm, while effective at correcting errors, requires on the order of 100 qubits to store a single logical qubit in memory. AWS's Ocelot quantum computer uses a more efficient error correction scheme that requires nine physical qubits per logical qubit in memory. IBM's error correction algorithm, known as a low-density parity check code, will make it possible to use 12 physical qubits per logical qubit in memory, a ratio comparable to AWS's. One distinguishing characteristic of Starling's design will be its anticipated ability to diagnose errors, known as decoding, in real time. Decoding involves determining whether a measured signal from the quantum computer corresponds to an error. However, other error correction schemes and hardware designs aren't out of the running yet. “It's still not clear what the winning architecture is going to be,” says Gillespie. It should be able to perform 100 million logical operations consecutively with accuracy; existing quantum computers can do so for only a few thousand. The system will demonstrate error correction at a much larger scale than anything done before, claims Gambetta. Previous error correction demonstrations, such as those done by Google and Amazon, involve a single logical qubit, built from a single chip. Still, it's unclear whether Starling will be able to solve practical problems. Some experts think that you need a billion error-corrected logical operations to execute any useful algorithm. Starling represents “an interesting stepping-stone regime,” says Wolfgang Pfaff, a physicist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. “But it's unlikely that this will generate economic value.” (Pfaff, who studies quantum computing hardware, has received research funding from IBM but is not involved with Starling.) The timeline for Starling looks feasible, according to Pfaff. The design is “based in experimental and engineering reality,” he says. “They've come up with something that looks pretty compelling.” But building a quantum computer is hard, and it's possible that IBM will encounter delays due to unforeseen technical complications. IBM's road map involves first building smaller machines before Starling. This year, it plans to demonstrate that error-corrected information can be stored robustly in a chip called Loon. Next year the company will build Kookaburra, a module that can both store information and perform computations. By the end of 2027, it plans to connect two Kookaburra-type modules together into a larger quantum computer, Cockatoo. This strategy, says Pfaff, reflects the industry's recent embrace of “modularity” when scaling up quantum computers—networking multiple modules together to create a larger quantum computer rather than laying out qubits on a single chip, as researchers did in earlier designs. After Starling, it plans to build another, Blue Jay. The emissions from individual AI text, image, and video queries seem small—until you add up what the industry isn't tracking and consider where it's heading next. Pigs whose DNA makes them resistant to a virus could be the first big consumer product using gene editing. Some ecologists and local residents are far less sure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration's chainsaw approach to federal spending lives on, even as Elon Musk turns on the president. On May 28, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced he'd be gutting a key office at the Department of Defense responsible for testing and evaluating the safety of weapons and AI systems. It is a significant overhaul of a department that in 40 years has never before been placed so squarely on the chopping block. Here's how today's defense tech companies, which have fostered close connections to the Trump administration, stand to gain, and why safety testing might suffer as a result. The Operational Test and Evaluation office is “the last gate before a technology gets to the field,” says Missy Cummings, a former fighter pilot for the US Navy who is now a professor of engineering and computer science at George Mason University. Though the military can do small experiments with new systems without running it by the office, it has to test anything that gets fielded at scale. “In a bipartisan way—up until now—everybody has seen it's working to help reduce waste, fraud, and abuse,” she says. That's because it provides an independent check on companies' and contractors' claims about how well their technology works. The gutting comes at a particularly pivotal time for AI and military adoption: The Pentagon is experimenting with putting AI into everything, mainstream companies like OpenAI are now more comfortable working with the military, and defense giants like Anduril are winning big contracts to launch AI systems (last Thursday, Anduril announced a whopping $2.5 billion funding round, doubling its valuation to over $30 billion). Hegseth claims his cuts will “make testing and fielding weapons more efficient,” saving $300 million. But Cummings is concerned that they are paving a way to faster adoption while increasing the chances that new systems won't be as safe or effective as promised. “The firings in DOTE send a clear message that all perceived obstacles for companies favored by Trump are going to be removed,” she says. Anduril and Anthropic, which have launched AI applications for military use, did not respond to my questions about whether they pushed for or approve of the cuts. “It's not that we'll go from effective to ineffective, but you might not catch some of the problems that would surface in combat without this testing step.” It's hard to say precisely how the cuts will affect the office's ability to test systems, and Cancian admits that those responsible for getting new technologies out onto the battlefield sometimes complain that it can really slow down adoption. But still, he says, the office frequently uncovers errors that weren't previously caught. It's an especially important step, Cancian says, whenever the military is adopting a new type of technology like generative AI. Systems that might perform well in a lab setting almost always encounter new challenges in more realistic scenarios, and the Operational Test and Evaluation group is where that rubber meets the road. It's true that the military was experimenting with artificial intelligence long before the current AI boom, particularly with computer vision for drone feeds, and defense tech companies have been winning big contracts for this push across multiple presidential administrations. The Pentagon is announcing ambitious pilots specifically for large language models, a relatively nascent technology that by its very nature produces hallucinations and errors, and it appears eager to put much-hyped AI into everything. I'm not sure that's a win for anyone. This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here. Adoption of the tech has civil liberties advocates alarmed, especially as the government vows to expand surveillance of protesters and students.
