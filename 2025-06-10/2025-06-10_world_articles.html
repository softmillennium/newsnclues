                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robert F Kennedy's “clean sweep” of a critical vaccine advisory panel spread shock and dismay among health experts, as many warned the health secretary's decision would erode trust in the US vaccine approval system. The secretary fired all 17 members of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) advisory committee for immunization practices (ACIP) – a group of scientific experts who recommend how vaccines should be administered and distributed. “Some would try to explain this away by blaming misinformation or antiscience attitudes,” Kennedy wrote in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, announcing the change, on Monday. A press release from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which Kennedy leads, said ACIP's upcoming June meeting would go forward as planned. Dr Tom Frieden, president and CEO of the public health non-profit Resolve to Save Lives and a former CDC director, said in a statement on X that Kennedy's decision to remove the “seventeen dedicated doctors, pediatricians, scientists, and parents who served on [ACIP]” is “a dangerous and unprecedented action that makes our families less safe”. Before becoming secretary, Kennedy led arguably the world's most influential anti-vaccine advocacy group and was paid by personal injury law firms for referring alleged victims of vaccine injuries. “It shouldn't matter which administration appointed the members of a federal scientific advisory committee. The wholesale firing and replacement of ACIP members is a blatantly political act that will undermine scientific impartiality and integrity, not promote it.” The CDC usually, though not always, takes ACIP's recommendations. A complementary panel advises the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on whether to approve vaccines, called the vaccine and related biologic products advisory committee (VRBPAC). Those schedules are then used by insurers to decide which vaccines their plans should cover – making them a critically important document for Americans' access to immunizations. Still, the CDC is without a leader, and Kennedy has not signed off on the most recent recommendations from ACIP, according to reporting from STAT. The decision to fire the entire ACIP committee comes after Kennedy attempted to make an end-run around them for a separate announcement: that Covid-19 vaccines would no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. But Kennedy's initial announcement, which hit social media with few details, similarly shocked doctors. Kennedy oversees both agencies in his role as health secretary. Doctors worried Kennedy's decision would bring “devastating consequences” for pregnant women, who are known to be more susceptible to severe complications from Covid-19 infection. “This represents an extremely positive development,” said Nicolas Hulscher, administrator for the McCullough Foundation, a nonprofit affiliated with Peter McCullough, a well known anti-vaccine campaigner. “We hope ACIP will be repopulated with truly independent experts who prioritize public safety over Vaccine Ideology.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>20,000 people chose to be part of the Kyiv Independent community —  thank you. The report comes amid a high-profile public conflict between Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest businessman, and his former ally, U.S. President Donald Trump. In May, Musk announced he would step down as an advisor to Trump and as the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Since then, he has emerged as a major critic of the president. It would be foolish not to ask their opinion on all sorts of issues," Errol Musk was quoted as saying by the Russian state news agency TASS. According to Kommersant, scheduled speakers include Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, oligarch Konstantin Malofeev, and prominent state TV anchor Ekaterina Andreeva. Errol Musk, a former South African businessman and politician, has publicly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him "a strong leader" and saying that "it would be foolish not to admire Putin" in an April interview with BBC Russia. SpaceX holds billions in Pentagon and NASA contracts, including a $1.8-billion agreement with the U.S. intelligence community to build a classified spy satellite system. Despite initially aiding Ukraine by providing Starlink terminals to stabilize battlefield communications, Elon Musk has increasingly echoed Kremlin-aligned narratives. He has suggested that President Volodymyr Zelensky lacks public support in Ukraine and has repeatedly called U.S. aid a driver of a "never-ending draft meat grinder." Those statements have been warmly received by Russian officials, military bloggers, and state media outlets, which have praised Musk as a voice of reason and a critic of Western involvement in the war. Dmitry Novikov, deputy chairman of the Russian parliament's international affairs committee, said on June 6 that Moscow is ready to grant political asylum to Musk following his public dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mike Huckabee suggested any future Palestinian state should be carved out of ‘a Muslim country' The former Arkansas governor chosen by Donald Trump as his envoy to Israel went further by suggesting that any future Palestinian entity could be carved out of “a Muslim country” rather than requiring Israel to cede territory. Those probably won't happen “in our lifetime”, he told the news agency. When pressed on Palestinian aspirations in the West Bank, where 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli occupation, Huckabee employed Israeli government terminology, asking: “Does it have to be in Judea and Samaria?” Trump, in his first term, was relatively tepid in his approach to a two-state solution, a longtime pillar of US Middle East policy, and he has given little sign of where he stands on the issue in his second term. The state department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Middle East analysts said the comments made explicit a shift that has been broadly expected. “The signs were there even in the first Trump term, which nominally supported a Palestinian ‘state' that was shorn of all sovereignty and under permanent Israeli control. Yousef Munayyer, head of Palestine/Israel Program at the Arab Center Washington DC, said Huckabee was merely articulating what US policy has long demonstrated in practice. The ambassador's position has deep roots in his evangelical Christian beliefs and longstanding support for Israeli settlement expansion. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Huckabee said: “There is no such thing as a Palestinian.” In a 2017 visit to the occupied West Bank, he rejected the concept of Israeli occupation entirely. “I think Israel has title deed to Judea and Samaria,” said Huckabee at the time. What distinguishes Huckabee, Munayyer argued, has been his willingness to be explicit about objectives that previous officials had kept veiled. “This will put European and Arab states in a bind, since they are still strongly committed to two states but have always deferred to Washington,” Elgindy said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>France said it has received a letter from the Palestinian Authority that contains “concrete and unprecedented commitments” to reform as Paris prepares to co-chair a conference on Palestinian statehood in New York. The letter, which France said was signed by Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas, includes condemnation of the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, a call on Hamas to immediately release all hostages, and pledges to hold elections and reform the authority, according to excerpts shared with CNN. “Hamas will no longer rule Gaza and must hand over its weapons and military capabilities to the Palestinian Security Forces, which will oversee their removal outside the occupied Palestinian territory, with Arab and international support,” the Élysée Palace cited Abbas as writing. The letter France says it received comes as anticipation builds around whether President Emmanuel Macron might recognize the State of Palestine at a summit next week aimed at building support for Palestinian statehood at the United Nations. France is co-chairing the summit with Saudi Arabia. CNN has reached out to the PA for comment. France said Abbas pledged to organize presidential and general elections within a year in order to “rejuvenate the Palestinian governance.” He has led the PA since the death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in 2004 and has clung to power despite being seen by critics as lacking democratic legitimacy. Proposals put forth by Arab states for a post-war Gaza have excluded Hamas from governance and called for the reformation of the PA. The Guardian reported on Saturday that France may be retreating from its plan. However, an Élysée source told CNN that the French presidency refutes such reports, and that Paris is moving in the direction of recognizing a Palestinian state. “We can clearly see that some have an interest in suggesting that we are not moving in the direction of recognition. France would be the most prominent Western country to recognize Palestinian statehood. Last year, Spain, Ireland and Norway formally recognized the State of Palestine in a move that provoked backlash from Israel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an aphorism sometimes attributed to Leo Tolstoy, sometimes to John Gardner, all literature relies on one of two plots: a person goes on a journey or a stranger comes to town. Everything else is just elaboration on that basic plot. Some of history's worst atrocities can be attributed to certain people trying to control other people's movements, whether by capturing them, herding them into prison camps (concentration camps, strategic hamlets, model villages), enslaving and transporting them, or warehousing them in besieged countries or regions while barricading the borders of anyplace to which they might want to flee, often consigning them to death in treacherous deserts or seas for trying to exercise the basic human right of freedom of movement. In February, President Trump astonished the world by proclaiming that the United States should “take over” Gaza and rid it entirely of its Palestinian population. Yet in many ways, as startling as that might have seemed, his proposal fit right in with his drive to remove millions of people from the United States. Colonizers invade and drive people out or enslave, transport, enclose, and imprison them while barricading off the privileged spaces they create for themselves. In a vicious cycle, colonizers or imperial powers justify their borders and walls in the name of “security” while protecting themselves from those desperate to escape their domination. And such ideas, old as they may be, are still distinctly with us. Or consider historian and scientist Jared Diamond's nonchalant claim that “no traditional society tolerated the relatively open access enjoyed by modern American or European citizens, most of whom can travel anywhere… merely by presenting a valid passport and visa to a passport control officer.” Diamond argued that Americans and Europeans exemplify the freedoms of modernity, while more “traditional societies” oppress people by restricting their travel. But if Americans and Europeans enjoy the freedom to travel, it's not because they are so much more modern than other inhabitants of this planet. It's because other countries don't restrict their freedom. Perhaps we could better define modernity as the European drive to control mobility, forcing others to accept their intrusions while denying free mobility to the rest of the world. Both countries claim to be liberal democracies and celebrate their commitment to equal rights, while reserving those rights for some and excluding others. While it's easy to imagine that colonialism is part of our past, think again. Its structures, institutions, and ideas still haunt our world. And one of the defining powers of colonizers always was the way they reserved for themselves (and only themselves) the right to move freely, while also reserving the right to move those they had colonized around like so many chess pieces. The “rules-based world order” that emerged after World War II created institutions for international cooperation and international law, ended colonial empires (as the former colonies gained independence), and dismantled segregation in the United States and, eventually, apartheid in South Africa. But none of that truly or totally erased what had existed before. In the U.S., people of color are full citizens and can no longer, as a group, be legally enclosed or removed against their will. But the post-colonial world has developed a new form of global apartheid, where the racialized drive to enclose and remove is now directed at immigrants, the vast majority of them escaping the ongoing ravages left by colonialism (and more recently climate change) in their own countries. Its colonizing project was carried out just as other colonized peoples were throwing off their rulers. Meanwhile, Israel created its own legal version of apartheid (even as South Africa's was dismantled), with those Palestinians who were not expelled increasingly surrounded by prisons and walls. In 1895, in an often-quoted passage, Zionism's founder, Theodor Herzl, proposed that “we shall try to spirit the penniless [Arab] population across the border… The removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly.” During the post-World War I British Mandate in Palestine, Zionist, Arab, and British officials agreed that “there could be no viable Jewish state in all or part of Palestine unless there was a mass displacement of Arab inhabitants.” Palestine's British colonial authorities advocated such a displacement in their 1937 Peel Commission Report. It was then enthusiastically endorsed by Zionist leaders like David Ben-Gurion, later Israel's first prime minister (“The compulsory transfer of the Arabs from the valleys of the proposed Jewish state could give us… an opportunity which we never dared to dream in our wildest imaginings”) and Chaim Weizmann (“If half a million Arabs could be transferred, two million Jews could be put in their place”). But in Israel, we are witnessing such a project happening before our very eyes. Citizenship by birth, mandated by the 14th Amendment after the Civil War, complicated that picture because non-Whites born in U.S. territories also became citizens. But those rights were always fragile and accompanied by anti-immigrant and deportation campaigns, increasingly justified with the concept of “illegality.” Developments in the twenty-first century clearly suggest that the arc of history does not necessarily bend toward justice, as a racial deportation regime resurges in a major fashion under President Donald Trump. He, of course, has long distinguished between “shithole countries” and “countries like Norway” as he continues to tighten the screws around most immigrants from Africa, Asia, and Latin America, while recently ostentatiously welcoming White Afrikaaners from South Africa. The Trump administration's repressive treatment of immigrants includes endless border militarization, the stripping of legal status from hundreds of thousands of immigrants, inventing increasingly draconian excuses for deportation, expanding immigrant incarceration, and pursuing exotic extraterritorial imprisonment and deportation schemes, including pressuring and bribing countries ranging from Costa Rica and Venezuela to Libya and South Sudan to take people forcibly deported from the United States. Others are being disappeared into prisons in Guantánamo and El Salvador. Strangely — or maybe not so strangely — at the same time that the United States is deporting such “despicable human beings,” it's demanding the extradition of others, including dozens of Mexicans. “The United States' intention is to extend its justice system,” a Mexican security analyst explained, so that the U.S. can prosecute Mexicans for crimes committed in Mexico. The new United Nations — made up primarily of colonizers who had been keen to deport (or, in the case of the United States, make sure they didn't add to) their own Jewish populations — partitioned Palestine to create Israel at the end of 1947. As the only powerful country to emerge from World War II unscathed, the United States would play an outsized role in that organization. President Trump's proposal to take Gaza and eliminate its population expresses his own (and Israel's) settler-colonial dream for what Australian anthropologist Patrick Wolfe famously called the “elimination of the native.” Trump initially suggested deporting Gaza's population to Egypt and Jordan, then to Sudan, Somalia, and Somaliland, and then to Libya — proposals enthusiastically endorsed by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. By mid-March of this year, Israel was creating a new migration authority to oversee the planned expulsion and 80% of Jewish Israelis found that plan “desirable” (though only 52% thought it was “practical”). As of late May, none of those countries had accepted Trump's proposal, though negotiations with Libya were evidently ongoing. In addition to the several Latin American countries where his administration has already sent deportees, it is looking to Angola, Benin, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Libya, Moldova, and Rwanda as possibilities. In ordering the deportation of protester Mahmoud Khalil and others, Rubio claimed that their “condoning antisemitic conduct” undermined American foreign policy objectives. The United States and Israel share another dystopian project as well: ratcheting up fear and suffering to inspire people to “self-deport.” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem flooded social and other media with a “multimillion dollar ad campaign” threatening immigrants: “Leave now. If you don't, we will find you and we will deport you.” In this respect, MAGA Republicans differed little from liberal Democrats, as Noem was echoing Vice President Kamala Harris's words to Guatemalans: “Don't come… If you do, you will be turned back.” In an eerily similar fashion, on the Israeli-occupied West Bank, “settler advertisements appear on screens and billboards telling Palestinians, ‘There is no future in Palestine. '” Though their tactics differ in scale — the United States is not massacring immigrants and bombing their neighborhoods — they share the goal of eliminating a population. One apparent difference makes the comparison even more revealing. They then remained enslaved and their mobility restricted for almost a century. In the United States, this means people of color. Native Americans are incarcerated at four times the rate of White people. (Such statistics are hard to come by today, so that figure doesn't include the thousands taken prisoner since Oct. 7, 2023.) Many Palestinian prisoners languish in what Israel calls “administrative detention,” a status created for Palestinians that allows lengthy detention without charge. We are so accustomed to imagining a world of equally sovereign countries, each creating its own immigration policy, that it's easy to miss the colonial dimensions of immigration flows and the ways that colonial histories, immigration restrictions, expulsions, and incarceration are connected. Settler countries like Israel and the United States have particular similarities (and particular connections), but most European powers that have benefited from the world's colonial order now barricade their borders against potential migrants.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump's policies aren't just about ethnic cleansing, they're about ideological cleansing, says writer Jean Guerrero. President Trump has inflamed tensions over immigration raids in Los Angeles, which his top adviser Stephen Miller described as an insurrection. “They want protesters to react violently to distract from what is really happening, which is that families are being separated, our communities are being devastated, and the people of Los Angeles are standing up to say, ‘We will not stand for this,'” says Jean Guerrero, New York Times contributing opinion writer and author of Hatemonger: Stephen Miller, Donald Trump, and the White Nationalist Agenda. Meanwhile, she notes Trump's budget bill would fund a massive expansion of federal immigration enforcement and turn it into a threat to the civil rights of everyone. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: We begin today's show in Los Angeles as the Trump administration sends more troops into the city following four days of protests against military-style immigration raids. The Pentagon has deployed 700 marines to Los Angeles, and President Trump has deployed an additional 2,000 members of the National Guard, bringing the total National Guard members to 4,000. We'll speak to California's Attorney General Rob Bonta later in the broadcast. On Monday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass decried the militarized response. MAYOR KAREN BASS: We didn't need the National Guard. Do you know what the National Guard is doing now? They are guarding the Federal Building here, in downtown, and they're guarding the Federal Building in Westwood. So, they need marines on top of it? That's why I feel like we are part of an experiment that we did not ask to be a part of. AMY GOODMAN: Despite the Trump administration's militarized response, community protests against ICE raids are continuing in Los Angeles and other cities. In fact, on Saturday, the day that President Trump will be celebrating his 79th birthday, and there will be Abrams tanks in a birthday parade in Washington, D.C., rolling through the streets of the capital. I want to be clear about what is happening here. And it is a beautiful thing to see. I was just at one of the protests yesterday, where I spoke to grandmothers, you know, white grandmothers, who are going out to protect people that they love and who they're afraid could be picked up by ICE. I spoke to Latinas who are, you know, afraid of being racially profiled and arrested because of the indiscriminate nature of these arrests, but they are nevertheless putting their bodies on the line, because they're citizens and they believe in using their privilege to defend the people that they care about. And these protests have been largely peaceful. You know, these are people who want to tell ICE that they are not welcome in their communities. And what we're seeing is a provocation. They want protesters to react violently to distract from what is really happening, which is that, you know, families are being separated, our communities are being devastated, and the people of Los Angeles are standing up to say, “We will not stand for this.” But the administration is trying to bait them into violence, to brand them as rebels and justify sweeping federal crackdowns and to create the viral images that will distract Americans from the appalling reality that ICE is kidnapping valued community members and destroying families here in Los Angeles. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Jean, you've posted on social media, quote, “Trump's immigration agenda is not about law and order. It's about re-engineering the racial demographics of this country.” Could you elaborate, especially in terms of the fact that Stephen Miller, Trump's key adviser, has called this a “fight for civilization”? You know, this crackdown is personal for Stephen Miller. As I report in my book, Hatemonger, when he was a high school student in Los Angeles, he frequently antagonized his Latino and immigrant classmates, telling them to, quote, “speak English” and to go back to their home countries. Back then, he was criticized for his views, and he has spent his career trying to punish the communities that rejected him. These mass deportations are not about border security. They're about erasing the multicultural fabric of places like Los Angeles. And, you know, I want to repeat that this is not about cracking down on crime. Let's remember that on his first day in office, President Trump pardoned the people who violently assaulted law enforcement during the storming of the Capitol on January 6th. So, Trump and Miller are not against crime. What they're doing is they're running a mafia state that scapegoats immigrants as a pretext for the subjugation of us all. So, again, they do not care about law and order. Miller's central obsession was never illegal immigration. This is why, from day one, you saw the strangling of refugees — access to refugees, a suffocation of the asylum system, strangling of green card access, the attack on birthright citizenship, trying to now invoke the Insurrection Act to deport people indiscriminately, simply based on the color of their skin. So, again, this is not about national security. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you talk about the number of journalists who have also been injured by law enforcement these past few days in Los Angeles? Several journalists, including colleagues of mine, have been hit with nonlethal rounds. I believe PEN America has recorded at least 27 attacks on L.A. journalists since June 6th. Reporters are being shot with rubber bullets and chemical munitions. And this is very concerning, because these so-called nonlethal rounds can, in fact, be fatal. The respected Chicano journalist Rubén Salazar was killed with a tear gas canister in 1970 while covering protests here in L.A., and that memory lingers for journalists here in the city, especially for Latino journalists who are trying to expose the injustices that are happening in their communities. AMY GOODMAN: Jean Guerrero, if you can talk about what is happening in — Los Angeles right now is where all of the attention is, because of this unprecedented calling out by Trump and Hegseth, the defense secretary, of the Marines and thousands of National Guard, federalizing them. But, in fact, this is happening all over the country. If you can talk more about the two men you wrote a book about, your book, Hatemongers: Stephen Miller, Donald Trump, and the White Nationalist Agenda? So, you see mass arrests taking place in Texas. I mean, what you're seeing is sort of exponentially what we saw during the first administration, which is resources are being diverted from serious homeland security investigations, from serious drug trafficking and human trafficking investigations, to try to meet these quotas of human beings rounded up to satisfy Miller's appetite for cracking down on immigrants, whether they're legal or whether they're here illegally. And these images are crucial, because each act of documentation is chipping away at the alternate reality that Trump and Stephen Miller have created, this alternate reality in which they are cracking down on gangsters and rapists and serious criminals. I cannot emphasize the importance of this enough. The administration is ramping up deportations to a never-before-seen level, which means that they are more visible than ever. They used to happen in the shadows. And people are taking out their phones. And as a result, these deportations, these arrests are becoming much harder to misrepresent, and this is a threat to the narrative that Trump and Stephen Miller have spent years putting out there. And so, I really believe that if Los Angeles refuses to be baited into violence, and instead stays disciplined and continues to dedicate themselves to relentless exposure of how ICE is kidnapping innocent people and what they're actually doing to valued members of our community, I think this can all end up backfiring on the Trump administration, and that Trump's attempt to provoke chaos in our communities will end up collapsing under its own cruelty. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Jean Guerrero, I wanted to ask you about the conflict, obviously, that has arisen between the elected officials in California and the Trump administration. You know, I was there as a reporter back in 1992 at the Los Angeles riot back then. And even by the time that President George H.W. Bush brought in the National Guard, 30 people had already been killed. And he did so at the request of a Republican governor, Pete Wilson, and a Democratic mayor, Tom Bradley. These are demonstrations of people who are simply trying to peacefully demonstrate and tell the federal government that they do not want these kidnappings of the people that they love in Los Angeles. The last time that you had a president issue this — you know, send the National Guard against the governor's wishes, I believe, was in 1963 to enforce desegregation in Alabama. I mean, you now see, you know, Trump talking about arresting Newsom and other California leaders. I mean, this is what authoritarian governments do. They use immigrants as a pretext to go after the opposition. And immigrants are just the first target. If you look at the white nationalist literature that inspired people like Stephen Miller, it vilifies not only law-abiding immigrants, but anyone who defends them. Those are the people who are, quote, “tainted by the milk of human kindness,” as one of Miller's formative books puts it. And so, the logical conclusion of Trump's policies is not just ethnic cleansing, it is ideological cleansing. They want to root out anyone who believes in compassion for the stranger, who believes in immigrant rights, who believes in a multicultural or multiracial democracy. And if you choose love or compassion, you are part of what is poisoning the blood of this country. AMY GOODMAN: Jean Guerrero, you contributed to a New York Times piece Monday headlined “Seven Hidden Ways Trump's Megabill Would Remake America,” in which you wrote, quote, “This bill would pave the way for the largest investment in federal immigration enforcement since the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 — one that would turn that department into a Trojan horse for an assault on the civil rights of all Americans.” Can you lay out your concerns? So, nearly two-thirds of Americans live in what is known as the 100-mile border enforcement zone, where people, under this bill — I mean, they already face the risk of warrantless seizures, of racial profiling, of constant surveillance, and this bill just makes it easier and more certain that all Americans in this country, and particularly if you live within that zone, are going to not be able to walk on the street without fear of being detained. And I think what this bill is doing is it's providing the government with the resources to be able to continue to do that at levels that we have never before seen in this country. AMY GOODMAN: Jean Guerrero, I want to thank you very much for being with us, New York Times contributing opinion writer and author of Hatemonger: Stephen Miller, Donald Trump, and the White Nationalist Agenda, speaking to us from Los Angeles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A shooter opened fire at a high school in the Austrian city of Graz on Tuesday, killing ﻿10 people, including teenagers, in one of the worst rampages in the country's history. Twelve students were injured in the incident, some of them seriously, Karner added. Graz University Hospital later said one of the seriously injured adults died on Tuesday evening. The suspect – a 21-year-old Austrian male who had previously attended the school but not graduated – used two weapons, a shotgun and a pistol, to carry out the killing spree, before fatally shooting himself in a bathroom, authorities said at the news conference. Officials would not give a motive for the gunman, who they say acted alone. The shooting pitched Austria into a state of shock and disbelief. Chancellor Christian Stocker announced three days of national mourning, writing on X: “There are no words for the pain and grief.” Several vehicles and a police helicopter were deployed to the site. Police said later in a statement that special forces were also deployed to the scene. The injured were taken to nearby hospitals for medical treatment, police also said. Stocker expressed horror at the shooting, writing on X: “The rampage at a school in Graz is a national tragedy that has deeply shaken our entire country. This inconceivable act suddenly tore young people from the life they still had ahead of them.” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said: “It is difficult to bear when schools become places of death and violence.” Gun violence is rare in Austria, along with most central European countries. The country's rate of firearm homicides was just 0.1 per 100,000 people in 2021, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, compared to 4.5 per 100,000 people in the United States. But Austria's gun ownership is higher than most European Union countries; there are 30 civilian firearms owned for every 100 citizens, according to the Small Arms Survey, a research institute based in Switzerland. A small number of high-profile violent incidents have taken place there in recent years. Last October, the mayor of a northern Austrian town was shot dead, along with another victim. This story has been updated with additional developments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fort Bragg, located near Fayetteville, N.C., serves as headquarters for U.S. Army Special Operations Command. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll will also be at Tuesday's event, along with service members, veterans and their families. Trump has promoted the Army's anniversary as a reason to hold a military parade in Washington on Saturday, which is also his 79th birthday. Trump, who sees the military as a critical tool for domestic goals, has used the recent protests in Los Angeles as an opportunity to deploy the National Guard and U.S. Marines to quell disturbances that began as protests over immigration raids. Opinion: For Trump, the L.A. protests are an opportunity to wield power and spread fear California leaders accused Trump of fanning protesters' anger, leading crowds to block off a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire. “We're gonna have troops everywhere,” Trump said over the weekend. It was named after a Confederate general, then renamed to Fort Liberty two years ago. Hegseth brought back the Bragg name but said it was being used to honor an Army paratrooper who served in the Second World War. The Trump administration on Monday ordered U.S. Marines into Los Angeles. The move marks another escalation in President Donald Trump's response to street protests over his aggressive immigration policies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These findings arrive as Prime Minister Mark Carney's government is weighing whether to scale back Ottawa's order for the F-35s and instead buy European-made fighter planes to reduce Canada's reliance on U.S. military equipment. But Auditor-General Karen Hogan's office said Tuesday it found this figure was based on outdated information and that by 2024, estimated costs had increased to $27.7-billion. Construction of two new fighter squadron facilities in Cold Lake, Alta., and Bagotville, Que., to accommodate the F-35s is more than three years behind schedule and the Forces are facing a possible shortage of qualified pilots, the watchdog said Tuesday. Trimming F-35 order could antagonize Trump as security and trade talks get under way: analysts The Department of National Defence “was supposed to closely monitor inflation and foreign currency exchange rates because of the potential impact but did not always do so,” it said. Auditor-General finds that inflation, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and heightened demand for munitions have driven up the cost of acquiring the F-35s.Johannes Christo/Reuters Canada's current fighter aircraft fleet of CF-18s is reaching the end of its service life and must be replaced in a timely manner to meet operational commitments such as the defence of Canada and North America, the Auditor-General's office noted. He committed to updating Canadians regularly on acquisition projects and blamed the huge cost increases on “external economic conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, including global supply chain disruptions, workforce shortages, and increased inflation and foreign exchange rates.” Speaking to reporters later Tuesday, Mr. McGuinty defended the F-35 acquisition and declined to offer any indication that the government might reduce its U.S. warplane order. Shortly after Mr. Carney took office in March, the Prime Minister said Ottawa would weigh trimming its F-35 purchase plans to buy an alternative aircraft that would be more cost-effective, and could deliver additional industrial benefits domestically instead of sending more dollars to the U.S. Speaking at a news conference Tuesday, Ms. Hogan said that while some of reasons for higher costs, such as inflation and currency fluctuations, are out of the government's control, Ottawa is responsible for higher costs related to delays in building the infrastructure required for the new aircraft. “I think that's my biggest concern here,” she said. Because right now, the interim measures are only going to see additional costs.” Andrea Charron, director of the Centre for Defence and Security Studies at the University of Manitoba, said there has not always been sufficient attention to big-ticket procurements both within the Department of National Defence and elsewhere, such as Treasury Board and Public Works. “Canada has lost many procurement specialists, and they tend to rotate positions, especially who is the lead on the F-35, and so there is not necessarily consistent, persistent attention to a very complicated file,” Prof. Charron said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>20,000 people chose to be part of the Kyiv Independent community —  thank you. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has questioned Russia's ability to attack NATO countries, as it is not "even capable of defeating Ukraine," he said in an interview with French TV channel LCI on June 8. "The Russians are too weak for that," Orban said. Over three years into its full-scale war, Russia has failed to achieve Ukraine's surrender or at least the complete occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, which was reportedly among the Kremlin's demands in Russia's first peace proposal in 2022. Russian troops have recently intensified their offensive, moving deeper into Sumy Oblast, as well as closing in on Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Russian propaganda has for years insisted that NATO and its further expansion pose a threat to Moscow. Orban, widely regarded as the European Union's most pro-Russian leader, said that it is not in the interests of the EU, including Hungary, to have "a direct conflict with Russia" or "a threat of war," so Ukraine must not join NATO. "Europe must be strengthened in the long term, and there must be a strategic agreement with Russia," Orban said, adding that sanctions against Russia are "destroying Hungary and the whole of Europe." Budapest has been blocking the opening of EU accession negotiation clusters with Kyiv and signaled further obstruction in recent weeks after Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) said it had uncovered a Hungarian spy network in western Ukraine. Orban also encouraged Hungarians to vote in a non-binding national poll on Ukraine's EU bid that the government launched in early March. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has told American journalist Tucker Carlson that he had never been arrested by authorities in Russia. In an interview released on Monday, Carlson noted that the Russian-born tech entrepreneur left the country more than a decade ago for political reasons. Durov was arrested in August 2024 at Paris–Le Bourget Airport, charged with 12 offenses linked to Telegram's handling of illegal content, including child exploitation material and narcotics trafficking, and prevented from leaving France for seven months. Asked if he sees any irony in only being arrested in France, a country that is viewed as “part of the free West,” Durov said Paris “was the most unexpected place to get arrested for me.” Durov said that he had visited several countries before arriving in France, some of which “are considered in the West to be autocratic or authoritarian.” He added that in many such nations, Telegram is popular because it provides “100% privacy.” “If Mark Zuckerberg or Elon [Musk] got grabbed… you'd be like ‘Stop—what? But they grabbed you and people are like, ‘Oh, he's got a Russian last name, it's fine. “I hope it had nothing to do with my ethnicity,” Durov replied. Durov has denied the French charges, calling them absurd. His arrest sparked an outpouring of sympathy worldwide, as well as accusations that France is infringing on freedom of speech. In late May, Durov claimed that the French government had sought to make Telegram block conservative voices in Romania ahead of the country's presidential runoff, but he refused.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's delays in fulfilling agreements with Russia are related to domestic factors and Kiev's relations with its backers, Rodion Miroshnik, the Russian Foreign Ministry's ambassador-at-large in charge of overseeing the Kiev regime's crimes, told Izvestia. Experts add that Ukraine's current authorities are afraid of losing face, which would exacerbate negative attitudes domestically. Moscow also offered Kiev to return the bodies of dead soldiers; however, Kiev has not yet taken its servicemen back. Against this background, Russian and Belarusian foreign ministers will discuss the situation around Ukraine. The Ukrainian authorities do not want to accept the bodies of their soldiers because such a number of fatalities undermines all narratives promoted by Ukrainian propaganda. Additionally, the majority of soldiers being handed over were killed in the Kursk area, while waging combat there was Zelensky's personal initiative, former Verkhovna Rada deputy Spiridon Kilinkarov told Izvestia. "I am confident that they will try to stall this procedure for as long as possible, questioning it, conducting a multitude of expert evaluations, and attempt to remove this issue from the spotlight so that the Ukrainians won't focus on it," he explained. Launching talks and continuing them is necessary in the very least to return soldiers home. Not only is this an argument against those who oppose interaction with Kiev but also a vivid demonstration that Russia is thinking about its servicemen in captivity and is making every diplomatic effort to release them, analyst Tigran Meloyan from the HSE Mediterranean Studies Center said. That said, the conflict's main topics, for instance, Ukraine's neutral status and territorial issues, cannot be resolved independently by Kiev, professor Natalya Yeremina of St. Petersburg State University concluded. Tough measures against protest rallies of migrants in California may lead to the loss of support for Donald Trump as well as give Democrats an excuse to criticize his policies, experts believe. The protests in Los Angeles have been underway for over three days. Earlier, about 6,000 people took to the streets waving Mexican flags, setting cars on fire, hurling stones and Molotov cocktails. Reacting to this, Trump ordered the deployment of about 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles bypassing California's authorities, which has already triggered criticism. The harsh methods of dispersing mass protests will definitely affect Trump's rankings even more, Konstantin Blokhin, a leading researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Center for Security Studies, told Izvestia. "This is precisely what the Democrats are waiting for because any suppression of protests will be used by them in the context of internal political clashes. And here Trump is at a crossroads: on the one hand, it is necessary to display sufficient toughness (such as deploying the National Guard), but not excessive because this would lead to backlash," the expert noted. At this stage, it is difficult to talk about the effectiveness of Trump's anti-migrant policy, Blokhin explained. Not much time has elapsed but the US leader cannot abandon this issue because it was one of his main promises during his election campaign. The protests in Los Angeles are considered legitimate as long as they remain peaceful, believes Pavel Koshkin, a senior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for US and Canadian Studies. California Governor Gavin Newsom must present convincing counterarguments in court, citing the state's autonomy. The protests may be supported in other US states, for example, in Florida and Massachusetts where the immigration issue is also pressing, believes Director of the Center for North American Studies at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Victoria Zhuravleva. For Newsom, the situation became an opportunity to signal his presidential ambitions while defending California's interests. High-ranking representatives from the US and China held a new round of trade talks in London on June 9. It was expected that they would focus on the issues of Beijing's export control over rare-earth metals, which has tightened since the onset of an all-out trade war. "China's economy is displaying greater stability compared to the American one," he emphasized. The US remains dependent on Chinese products, and American businesses in China are interested in retaining the current economic relations. Speaking of China's potential response measures, Lukonin is forecasting continued subsidies for the export sector, bolstered control over rare-earth metals supply chains, and the introduction of selective restrictions on the purchases of US goods. In his opinion, a major purchase of US agricultural products by China may become a potential way out of the current situation, just as it happened during Trump's first presidential term. Kochetkov points out that currently both sides are in a balanced position, and the "current talks will inevitably be based on mutual compromises." This involves the OPEC+ eight members, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, Algeria, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, and Oman, abandoning their voluntary reduction of oil production to 2.2 million barrels per day. It is enough to recall the Vostok Oil project, which will be launched relatively soon with an annual production of up to 100 million tons. However, for Russia, it is not the opportunity to boost oil output but the infrastructure bottlenecks for raw material exports such as ice-class tankers that becomes more pressing. The oil alliance has largely lost its effectiveness, and any further reduction in production would result in losing more and more market niches without any significant surge in global prices. According to Finam analyst Nikolay Dudchenko, there are several possible explanations behind OPEC+ increasing oil production. The first is a likely reaction to seasonal growth in demand. Countries can join the new format either as partners or observers. "The CIS Plus platform is being developed and is similar to BRICS+ bringing in partners who are not necessarily formal members of the organization. That is, participation in the CIS is possible both via membership and also via partnership or observation," Andrey Sazonov, director of the CIS Department for Cooperation in the Political, Humanitarian and Social Spheres, told Izvestia. The CIS and SCO have many points of intersection. For example, for both organizations, fighting terrorism and curbing drug trafficking is important, Belarusian political scientist Alexey Dzermant told the newspaper. "So, such countries as Pakistan, India, and Iran could also benefit from the CIS Plus format," he said. The organizations can also collaborate on resolving humanitarian and cultural issues. "The majority of these formats do not involve any strict obligations for members. That is, unlike classic integration projects or military-political alliances, these new-generation multilateral groups are extremely flexible. One could say that so far, the ‘entry ticket' to these structures is cost-free. This is also their advantage, something that makes them attractive," the expert concluded.

MOSCOW, June 10. /TASS/. The change of power in Syria, conflicts in the Gaza Strip and constant pressure on Iran are fueling the escalation of Islamic radicalism worldwide, Alexander Bortnikov, head of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), said.

"The change of power in Syria, the Gaza Strip conflict, constant pressure on Iran and the escalation of the situation in Libya are contributing to the spread of Islamic radicalism across the globe. Against this backdrop, the activity of ISIS (the Islamic State, IS, banned in Russia - TASS) and its branches in Afghanistan has intensified. The risks of the Islamic State's growing influence in Syria have emerged," he stated in a welcoming address to participants in the 18th meeting of department chiefs responsible for counterterrorism efforts at CIS security agencies, which is taking place in Moscow in the year of the 25th anniversary of the CIS Anti-Terrorism Center (ATC).

The FSB chief noted the threats to CIS security caused by mounting instability in the Middle East, Africa, the Afghan-Pakistani zone and Central Asia.

"This is mainly driven by the West's intensified push to retain its geopolitical status, including the use of terrorist groups, and its ongoing neo-colonial policy. The leading role in this belongs to the Anglo-Saxon powers," Bortnikov emphasized.

According to him, the ringleaders of international terrorist organizations are banking on the militants active in Afghanistan and Syria, as well as on the terrorists from among Russian, Central Asian and South Caucasus natives released from Syrian jails who are "already openly announcing their aggressive plans with regard to their countries of origin."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. VALI NASR is Majid Khadduri Professor of International Affairs and Middle East Studies at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and the author of Iran's Grand Strategy: A Political History. During his visit to the Middle East in May, U.S. President Donald Trump did several things that few would have predicted months or even weeks earlier. One was his surprise meeting with Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Shara, and the subsequent lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria, notwithstanding Shara's history as a leader of a militant Islamist group. Another was his decision not to include Israel on the itinerary, despite his administration's ongoing efforts to end the war in Gaza. Along with Trump's initiation of direct talks with Iran—a step that Israel adamantly opposes but Arab leaders in the Persian Gulf welcomed and even helped facilitate—these developments suggest how much the regional balance of power has changed since Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. They supported the first Trump administration's “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran, and they began to normalize relations with Israel. Meanwhile, Israel looks increasingly like a regional hegemon. Amid these developments, Washington's Arab allies and Israel are now in opposite camps on the merits of a new nuclear deal. Israel still sees a deal as a lifeline for the Islamic Republic and has been urging the Trump administration instead to take military action to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities. In their effort to achieve a new balance between Israel and Iran, the Gulf states have become primary players in Trump's push for a new nuclear deal. Together, they aim to become the fulcrum of a reconfigured regional order. At the time, the Arab world was still recovering from popular uprisings during the 2010–11 Arab Spring, which had toppled once powerful rulers and sparked civil wars in Libya, Syria, and Yemen. To its Middle East detractors, the JCPOA was not just about Iran's nuclear capabilities but also about Iran's relative influence. According to the terms of the deal, Iran got sanctions relief just for agreeing to limit its nuclear program; it was not required to rein in its proxy forces in the region. As a result, the deal threatened to increase Iran's sway even as it curbed the country's pursuit of nuclear weapons. Arab states thus joined hands with Israel to underscore this flaw and used it in a high-profile effort to undermine the JCPOA. In addition to aggressively lobbying members of Congress—an offensive symbolized by Netanyahu's 2015 speech—this effort included a public and media campaign against the deal. During his first administration, Trump concurred with the deal's critics. At the time, the Trump administration expected that this pressure would weaken Iran and shrink its regional influence in favor of a new regional order centered on Israel and Washington's Arab allies. The tougher U.S. strategy toward Iran continued under President Joe Biden. Contrary to expectations, the Biden administration did not restore the JCPOA and eschewed engaging with Iran—agreeing to talks only after Iran raised the stakes by accelerating its accumulation of highly enriched uranium. Biden's focus, much like Trump's, was instead on forging an Arab-Israeli axis. As events would soon make clear, that assumption was terribly misguided. Iran responded to U.S. pressure by expanding its nuclear program and its support for the Houthis in Yemen in their war with the Gulf states. It also began directly attacking U.S. and Gulf interests, most notably Saudi oil facilities, in 2019. In March 2023, Saudi Arabia broke ranks to normalize ties with Iran—in a deal brokered by China. One immediate benefit was an end to Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The Gulf states remained committed to expanding ties with Israel, but maintaining a balance between Iran and Israel would prove difficult. A resurgent “axis of resistance,” backed by Iran—including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, who, along with Hamas saw the prospect of Israeli-Saudi normalization as an existential threat—was now at open war with Israel. In late September, Israel eliminated Hezbollah's top leadership, including the organization's longtime leader, Hasan Nasrallah, in a targeted bomb attack—a strike that followed on the heels of a successful undercover operation that decimated the group's command-and-control structure using exploding pagers. And in early December, the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, a longtime close Iranian ally, collapsed. Meanwhile, dangerous exchanges of missiles and drones between Iran and Israel raised the stakes but also further dented Iran's aura of power, with Israel claiming to have neutralized many of Iran's air defenses. Even Iran's defense of its homeland looked vulnerable. Yet Trump has not followed the expected Israeli script. Worried that military strikes on Iran will pull the United States into a costly war, the president has thus far resisted Israeli pressure to dispense with diplomacy and wage open war on Iran. Instead, he has pushed for a new version of precisely the thing he repudiated during his first term: a nuclear deal. In doing so, he is backed by the Gulf states, which, despite their opposition to the earlier deal, also now favor diplomacy with Iran. The most obvious reason for this shift is fear of what war in the Gulf would do to their economies. Even as it continues its offensive in Gaza, Israel has already begun to emerge triumphant, confident in its absolute military superiority, and ready to use it to assert domination over the Middle East. In addition to expanding its occupation of Gaza, which Israeli leaders have suggested could be put under indefinite military rule, Israel has been imposing its will on south Lebanon and is occupying and carrying out military incursions into large swaths of Syria. And now it wants to extend its victorious campaign in the Levant to the Gulf, with a military attack on Iran. The Middle East's main power brokers, including the Arab states, Iran, Israel, and Turkey, have historically resisted domination by one regional actor. Even after the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Israel was not reflexively hostile to Iran if regional power balancing dictated otherwise: in the early years of the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, when Saddam Hussein's Iraq was gaining an upper hand and posing as a claimant to leadership of the Arab world, Israel supplied revolutionary Islamist Iran with intelligence and war materiel. Now that Israel is laying claim to being the region's unrivaled power, Arab states and Iran—and also Turkey—need each other to establish a balance. Among the former are Bahrain, Egypt, and Jordan, which do not have diplomatic relations with Iran but, like other Arab powers, have drastically increased their engagement. Israel wants an axis with the Arab world that would contain Iran, and Iran wants to deny Israel a footprint in the Arabian Peninsula. For their part, Gulf leaders want a regional order that restrains both Iran and Israel while empowering their own governments. It is this balancing imperative that has turned Washington's Gulf allies from erstwhile opponents of a nuclear deal into strong advocates. As they see it, a new deal between Iran and the United States would deny Israel a path to war with Iran that could spill onto their shores, and then only confirm Israel's unchecked regional supremacy. In turn, Iran, which is eager to conclude a nuclear deal to avoid war and boost its ailing economy, has become increasingly dependent on the Gulf states to manage the Trump administration and keep the negotiations going. Oman's foreign minister, for example, has played a key role in the talks by developing proposals that bridge differences between Tehran and Washington; Saudi Arabia has embraced the idea of creating a regional nuclear consortium with Iran to jointly manage uranium enrichment. The Saudi foreign minister has also suggested that the kingdom is willing to use its economic muscle to help a final deal take hold. It could build trust between the Gulf neighbors, enabling them to deepen their engagement to include security cooperation, investments, and trade. They want relations with both in order to strike a regional balance that works to their countries' advantage and ensures the peace and stability that are vital to the region's geoeconomic goals. For the Gulf states, a nuclear deal would align their strategy with Washington's Middle East policy, which could then be consecrated in a formal strategic partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia. Even before arriving in the region, his administration set aside Israel's concerns and concluded a bilateral cease-fire agreement with the Houthis. And on occasion, he seemed to acknowledge Arab concerns over the war in Gaza: in Abu Dhabi, for example, he said, “A lot of people are starving in Gaza”—apparently criticizing Israel's ten-week blockade on aid to the territory. But for this realignment to truly bring regional peace and stability, the United States must give a new nuclear deal with Iran a broader strategic framing. A deal would need to be reached in tandem with a push to expand the Abraham Accords, normalizing Israel's relations not only with Saudi Arabia but also with other Arab states, such as Syria. To resume normalization efforts with Israel, Riyadh will demand an end to the war in Gaza and a viable political future for the Palestinians. Yet at another level, the United States and its Gulf allies must think of normalization as a necessary complement to both a U.S.-Iranian nuclear deal and the growing Iran–Gulf state axis, with these three pieces together forming a new regional balance. Such an outcome would likely prolong regional conflict and foreclose any possibility of further Arab-Israeli normalization in the near term. But if a deal can be reached, the Gulf states have an opportunity to become the pivot of a new regional order, with axes running through them to Iran, Israel, and the United States. After years of war and turmoil, that might finally offer a real chance to bring stability to the region.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. JONATHAN HASKEL is Professor of Economics at Imperial College Business School. SLAUGHTER is Paul Danos Dean and Earl C. Daum 1924 Professor of International Business at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. From 2005 to 2007, he served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers. The chaotic trade policies of U.S. President Donald Trump have created a climate of uncertainty that does not bode well for the U.S. economy. But in the weeks since, Washington has reversed course on some tariffs and begun negotiations on others with major trading partners such as China. Meanwhile, U.S. policymakers are making sweeping changes to immigration policy and contemplating restrictions on foreign direct investment. Little wonder that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently described the administration's approach as “strategic uncertainty.” The outcome of this supposedly strategic uncertainty, however, is predictable. Brexit ended up being a protracted process, not a single event, as changes to British economic policies took years to negotiate and implement. Policy uncertainty facing the country's businesses surged and remained high for years. That sustained uncertainty did not fundamentally alter the United Kingdom's trade outlook; trade policies that had been in place before the Brexit vote remained mostly unchanged for some time. Indeed, for five years, British exports and imports remained almost constant; only after higher trade barriers with the EU were permanently in place in 2021 did trade volumes begin to fall. If Washington continues to embrace “strategic uncertainty,” the United States, too, will likely face years of stagnating investment, sluggish growth in its economic output, and flat or even falling standards of living. Many initial economic forecasts projecting Brexit's impact predicted that the United Kingdom's trade would fall, leading to lower output. Other forecasts predicted an immediate post-vote decline in trade and output. Trade openness, even allowing for the pandemic, moved more or less in line with other peer countries. Non-EU trade was also governed by EU agreements that likewise needed to be replaced. The major British political parties were split on what to do. “Soft” Brexiteers proposed making minimal changes, hoping to maintain common product safety standards, liberal movement of labor, highly integrated supply chains, and the existing, nearly frictionless trade in goods and services. “Hard” Brexiteers argued that minimal changes would betray the people's wishes and decried the government's slow-going approach as “Brexit in name only.” They preferred independent product standards, limited labor mobility, and the renegotiation of non-EU trade relations. Indeed, in June 2018, the then Brexit secretary David Davis, predicted that new trade deals with Canada and the United States would be secured within two years. In terms of actual policy changes, virtually nothing happened for nearly five years, as parliamentary and judicial challenges to Brexit came and went. And since 2020, no comprehensive new trade agreement has been reached with any substantial non-EU countries, either, despite years of negotiations. Instead, existing EU trade deals with all other nations were effectively rolled over. To this day, Britain's Brexit path remains meandering and slow. In May, the United Kingdom and the EU convened their first summit since the United Kingdom officially departed in late 2020, and contentious negotiations continue in key economic areas such as fisheries and agriculture. And that policy uncertainty turned out to be ruinous for business capital investment. Bernanke's key insight was that when confronted with high or rising uncertainty, companies with greater sunk investments—those that are unrecoverable—are more likely to delay making additional investments. Such companies will rationally wait for greater clarity on market demand and input costs, which are influenced greatly by government policies, to make innovation efforts. In reality, a great deal of business investment involves sunk costs, particularly for globally integrated companies. So if a country announces a fundamental change in its global economic relations but then leaves it unclear what new policies will prevail and when, the result is likely to be a sharp and sustained slowdown in capital investment by that country's companies. British business investment was about $85 billion in the second quarter of 2016; it was barely changed, at about $86.7 billion, in the last quarter of 2024. According to monthly surveys by the Bank of England since 2016, British firms have consistently cited Brexit-related uncertainty as one of their top three concerns. Over the same period, inflation-adjusted average incomes in the United Kingdom have risen by only about four percent; at that pace, it would take more than a century for average incomes to double. The typical British household would be earning almost $2,000 more a year today had Brexit not slowed growth in investment, innovation, and the economy overall. Nearly every possible indicator measuring the uncertainty that faces American businesses has surged. The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which tracks indicators including news articles discussing policy uncertainty and disagreement among prominent economic forecasts, nearly doubled when Trump was reelected, and then more than doubled again after Liberation Day. Leading publicly traded U.S.-based companies, including Ford, Mattel, Southwest, and UPS, have ceased publishing forecasts of future earnings because they say their business outlook is so unclear. Among small businesses, only 18 percent planned new capital outlays over that same period, the lowest percentage since April 2020, when the pandemic had just been declared. In 2022, the most recent year for which data is available, the parent companies of U.S.-based multinationals undertook 43.5 percent of all capital investment by U.S. companies and 66.6 percent of all research and development by U.S. companies. Despite the climate of uncertainty that Trump's policy chaos has fostered, there are some trends that favor the United States. For at least a year before Trump's reelection, the United States was enjoying a surge in capital investment linked to generative artificial intelligence. If the underlying business case for generative AI proves immune to the United States' trade wars, then this important driver of overall U.S. business investment will not wither. Moreover, Trump has repeatedly called for foreign-based multinationals to expand their investments in the United States rather than export their products here. Trump has unleashed a dizzying barrage of tariff increases, decreases, pauses, and negotiations with the United States' major trading partners. Under these circumstances, few globally connected U.S. companies are likely to announce large new capital investments. And foreign-based multinationals are facing the same U.S. policy uncertainty that U.S.-based companies are, which may inhibit their investments in the United States, too. As the United Kingdom learned after Brexit, uncertainty produces grinding stagnation in capital investment and R & D by private companies. That, in turn, leads to plummeting productivity growth and stagnant real incomes. The biggest lesson of Brexit is that policy uncertainty can chill business investment, growth in productivity, and incomes—quickly, lastingly, and painfully. The supporters of Trump's “strategic uncertainty” approach have been forewarned.
