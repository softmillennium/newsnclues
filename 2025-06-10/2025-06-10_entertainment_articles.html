                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here it is, in his own words. I would make the argument that there isn't a band of greater import. In terms of impact and the kind of shift they created, there isn't a greater American band. Everything was different after they appeared. Sly waded into the middle of a very tumultuous and explosive time in racial relations. He was making music in a time when entertainment and the culture of entertainment were changing. He came at the thing from a uniquely American perspective. He wasn't imitating those groups, but he studied what was happening with the British Invasion bands. The way he used choral harmony in what he was doing with the Family Stone was very much in line with what was happening with the Beatles and the Beach Boys. But he brought it in his own context. He was able to bring precision and abstraction together in a way that was unprecedented. There isn't a more American song than “Everyday People.” “Everyday People” isn't sentimental; it's not “We Are the World.” It looks at the way we don't get along and it says, well, “Different strokes for different folks.” And it also says, “We got to live together.” It doesn't say we have to hold hands and sing Kumbaya. It doesn't judge where anyone is coming from. It just lays out who we are and at the end of it says, we got to live together. “I am no better, neither are you.” That's very provocative. The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time He came at a pivotal time and he said things to America and Americans and to the world that they needed to hear. They may not have liked “Don't Call Me N—-r, Whitey,”  but he went there. That's the other side of “Everyday People” — demanding respect on his own terms. It's easy to understate Sly Stone's influence on popular music. Of course he's a great songwriter. He had an unusual, revolutionary take on the American experience. But there's the small things: Just the way he used his voice as almost like an envelope filter, like the sound of “ow” and “wow” — that sound that you hear on Sugarfoot with the Ohio Players or Maurice White with Earth, Wind and Fire. The electric bass taking center stage in different ways than James Jamerson's did. Bass guitarists from Victor Wooten, all the technicians, Stanley Clarke — Larry Graham is patient zero of that. When you hear Louis Johnson [of the Brothers Johnson] and on down the line, all the acrobatics — that starts for real with Larry Graham. Hear Sly and the Family Stone Rock a Small Club in 1967 With Funky ‘I Gotta Go Now' Garland Jeffreys Was One of Rock's Most Essential Voices. The idea of a mixed race and mixed gender band — he had two women who were vocalists. Her sound and her approach — I think she's woefully underrated because she didn't play jazz. Her trumpet playing is not generic. That horn section, there are only two, and the blend is incredible. It's not just that Sly was a singular genius — that band was incredibly impactful. His ability to see the connections aside from the divisions — he saw connections in music. He just went with what people gave him. His band members were completely devoted to his vision and they brought their extraordinary talents to bear. He was able to wield nostalgia, like “Hot Fun in the Summertime.” Even when I was a kid, that felt like the perfect summer that nobody actually ever had. “My only weapon is my pen/And the frame of mind I'm in/I'm a songwriter, a poet.” That is tremendous. When people say visionary, Sly Stone, Sylvester Stewart, was that, in many obvious and subtle dimensions. Certainly hearing “Family Affair” for me was seismic. I never heard anything like it, and it was like hearing “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds” at the time when I was a kid. I relate to Prince so much because we're the same age. We heard There's a Riot Goin' On at the same time. Sorry, That's Not Wyatt Russell in the Viral L.A. Protest Video Gavin Newsom Slams Trump's ‘Weakness' After Arrest Threat BET Awards 2025: The Complete Winners List Even though [1973's] Fresh was the end on a level, it's like a Hail Mary from beyond. Nobody is supposed to be able to come back like that after they've kind of undone everything, but he did, in a spectacular way. Sly gave us so much more than whatever his deficits were. If you think about his influence on Prince alone — and his influence goes far beyond that. And it's still having an influence today. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

There are a few things Margarita (Lillian Carrier) knows for sure: she does not want to get a job, she definitely does not want to get a job which requires her to wear “hard pants,” she loves horses, she loves her mom, and she's not eager to engage in much of anything that might open her up to ridicule. And yet, the young autistic woman — and Carrier herself is autistic — has already gone against some of those internal rules. She went to college and got a degree. She spends a lot of her time riding around on an adult-sized tricycle with a stuffed horse head attached to it (he's known as “Cheeseburger”). She loves doing karaoke with her mom Sandy (a heartbreaking Gretchen Mol) at their favorite restaurant. Related Stories Tribeca's Most Innovative Selections This Year Aren't Films — They're Podcasts Chanel Returns to New York City for Its Star-Studded 18th Annual Tribeca Artists Dinner Like any person, the push-pull of Margarita's wants and needs are constantly butting up against each other. Margarita's disability may, of course, impact and affect those wants and needs in slightly different ways (versus those of a neurotypical person), but the core of her experience is common. It's simply the human condition, but as the protagonist of Lauren Meyering's creative and emotionally complex feature directorial debut, “Horsegirls,” Margarita's life offers new ways of viewing seemingly old stories. And while hobby horsing — the wholly unexpected sport at the center of Meyering's film and Margarita's great awakening — might itself not be old or classic, the film functions a bit like any other great sports film. Based loosely on co-writer and producer Mackenzie Breeden's own experiences (the multi-hyphenate also appears in the film in a small supporting role), “Horsegirls” opens with Margarita's life already at an extreme crossroads, even if she does not yet realize it. The death of her husband — who she energetically recalls in funny stories, including Margarita's favorite, about the genesis of her name — was hard enough, but going through three rounds of cancer since then has been particularly harder to swallow. When we first meet Margarita, she's dreaming her way through a ride on Cheeseburger — Meyering blends in fantastical moments alongside the film's harder dramatic moments, a creative gamble that doesn't always work, even as it impresses — on her way to visit her mother at her chemotherapy appointment. No one is more assured of Margarita's capabilities than Sandy, but there's something deeply touching about the ways in which the film allows us to experience Margarita's revelations through her eyes (and Carrier's wonderful performance). It's easy enough to agree that Margarita should get a job, but what happens if her boss doesn't fully understand the way she works? For every moment Sandy is trying to nudge Margarita into the real world, she's also guilty of pulling her way back. She'd rather spend her time breaking into the local stables to hang out with the horses, who she adores and who her mother will no longer let her ride. And then, one night, a discovery: hobby horsing. Are those girls running around on stick horses, pretending to really be riding them? It's a clever way into the film and Margarita's own evolutions, a nifty way to remind us all of the power of Margarita's vision, a push toward keeping our own eyes open to things that might look, at first glance, a little silly. Sandy, who has begun to slowly orient herself toward teaching Margarita all the ways to be an adult, doesn't see it that way. Enter: a major schism in the relationship, just at the moment that both mother and daughter should be cherishing every moment together. But while Meyering and Breeden's script builds around familiar moments and worries (the film is a coming-of-age tale, tinged with sports drama, whimsical comedy, and a strong interest in showing “disability” in a new light), Margarita's approach to everything tilts things into fresher spaces. Carrier herself helped shape Margarita and her journey, and her perspective on the film's events adds an authenticity that feels new. It it, much like hobby horsing itself, one that also feels unexpected, occasionally misunderstood, and deserving of a closer look.

She joins previously cast Donnie Wahlberg, Sonequa Martin-Green, Ernie Hudson and Maggie Lawson. In Boston Blue, Wahlberg will reprise his Blue Bloods role as NYPD Officer Danny Reagan as he takes a position with Boston PD. Once in Boston, he is paired with Detective Lena Silver (Martin-Green), the eldest daughter of a prominent law enforcement family.

Her daughter Lena (Martin-Green) is a Boston Police Department Detective, and her stepdaughter Sarah (Lawson) is the Police Superintendent. Mae is accustomed to making decisions and standing by them. RELATED: Gemma Chan Joins Peacock Drama ‘The Five-Star Weekend' The Boston Blue casting directors may not have looked too far for Mae: Reuben and Martin-Green are coming off the movie My Dead Friend Zoe, released in February, in which they also played mother and daughter. Boston Blue is produced by CBS Studios in association with Jerry Bruckheimer TV. Jerry Bruckheimer, KristieAnne Reed and Wahlberg will also serve as executive producers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the spiritual sequel to his legendary 2004 Victoria's Secret commercial, Bob Dylan has provided narration for a new trailer announcing Machine Gun Kelly‘s next album, Lost Americana. “Lost Americana is a personal excavation of the American dream — a journey to find what's been lost,” Dylan drawls in the short clip. Dylan's narration is accompanied by a montage of home movie footage of MGK and friends, including some shots of the musician riding a motorcycle decked out in a custom Lost Americana biker jacket. Along with sharing the trailer, MGK said Lost Americana would arrive Aug. 8. The album will be his first in three years, following 2022's Mainstream Sellout. MGK has yet to reveal the full track list for Lost Americana, but the album will feature his recent single, “Cliché.” “Cliché” is actually one of several songs MGK has dropped this year, along with “Your Name Forever,” “Come Pick Me Up,” and a cover of the Goo Goo Dolls' “Iris” with Julia Wolf. It's unclear if any of these songs will also appear on the album. As for Dylan's involvement in the trailer, it comes after the legendary singer-songwriter posted, seemingly out of nowhere, a video of MGK rapping on his Instagram earlier this year. Even MGK was astounded, revealing he learned of Dylan's post while discussing with friends some of his concerns and reservations about his next album. Sorry, That's Not Wyatt Russell in the Viral L.A. Protest Video For those looking for some insight into the ever-mysterious movements of Dylan's taste and artistic predilections, who crave some explanation for how he even became aware of Machine Gun Kelly in the first place, Dylan scholar Ray Padgett shared a theory on Bluesky that is as hilarious as it is believable.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Netflix's The Adventures of Cliff Booth is slowly but surely starting to take shape as sources tell Deadline that Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is joining Pitt, who is reprising the role that won him an Oscar. Elizabeth Debicki and Scott Caan also are on board with David Fincher directing from a script by Quentin Tarantino. Plot details are vague, but sources say the film will follow one of Tarantino's characters as he now serves as a Hollywood fixer. As for who Mateen is playing, while not confirmed, sources say the character would be in the vein of Jim Brown, who famously ended is Hall of Fame football career early to focus on acting starring in such hits as The Dirty Dozen. When news broke that this movie was in the works, the town didn't know what to believe at first given that the idea of this project came to be sounds like something straight out of a script. So here is the backstory of how this came to be. Pitt indeed got Tarantino's blessing to show Pitt's Se7en director Fincher the script that focuses on subsequent adventures of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood's Cliff Booth character. And because Fincher is exclusive to Netflix, the movie — if it gets made — would be financed and released by Netflix, straight to streaming. That one seems headed for Sony, where Tarantino directed the first film. No way Tarantino would helm his final film for a streaming service, but he respects Fincher, and Netflix has been Fincher's domain since he helped establish the streaming giant with House of Cards. He also stars and executive produces the Man on Fire series for Netflix and star opposite Mark Wahlberg in Elegance Bratton's crime thriller By Any Means Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. The Monday morning I sat down with Celine Song in New York City, where she lives and where her hotly awaited new film “Materialists” is set, came about an hour after reviews broke. Led by an appealing cast and doubling as a breezy romance and an incisive critique of modern dating, “Materialists” is her second movie as a director, and her first since “Past Lives” turned Song into the Oscar-nominated belle of the 2023-2024 awards season. Reactions pouring in were going well, as most reviews (including IndieWire's) reacted positively to writer/director Song's portrait of matchmaker-to-the-moneyed Lucy (Dakota Johnson), who balances the clinical outlook on romance her job demands with an unexpected love triangle between herself, a lethally charming private-equity broker and potential client named Harry (Pedro Pascal), and her less-polished, struggling-actor ex John (Chris Evans). But Song, she said, doesn't read reviews. Related Stories ‘The Phoenician Scheme' Production Design Stretches Even Wes Anderson's Theatricality to the Limit Studio Ghibli at 40: Can an Ethical Animation Studio Still Exist, or Even Survive? Just because [reading reviews] sort of distances the movie, too,” Song told IndieWire. Song's latest movie takes the shape of the classic '90s rom-coms (think Nora Ephron) or rom-drams (think James L. Brooks) nobody makes for theaters anymore, but it has more on its mind, and is perhaps more cannily sociological than its predecessors. For one, Lucy lives in debt and out of her means on an $80,000 annual salary (which, a sad reality, for a single New Yorker living on their own in a studio or a one-bedroom as she does is at the low end of livable). For another, her clients, including Sophie (Zoë Winters), come to her frayed by the dating market, likely arriving at the matchmaking service Adore (run by Marin Ireland's character) after striking out once again on the apps. Song's breakout “Past Lives” — a ruminative, what-might-have-been walk-and-talk about a married Korean-American immigrant (Greta Lee) who reconnects with her childhood best friend and potential lost flame (Teo Yoo), premiered at Sundance 2023. Ecstatic acclaim and awards ambitions from A24 suddenly flung the first-time feature filmmaker (who got her creative start in the New York theater world after moving to Canada from Korea with her family when she was 12) onto the long-haul festival and awards circuit, which demands a lot from anyone. It would be more than a year until she finally attended the 2024 Oscars, where “Past Lives” was nominated for Best Picture, but in between, she attended innumerable fests and awards ceremonies to represent her critical darling. Again, the topic was love, which I could talk about forever. Journalists speculated as to why A24 opted to skip festivals and take “Materialists,” which wrapped in New York in Spring 2024, directly to theaters for a wide release this summer. It's opening on June 13 in around 2,800 theaters; “Past Lives” started in four theaters with a platform release two years ago, playing eventually at most in just over 900 to gross $11 million by the end of a nine-month run. (The fizzy rom-com-centered marketing on “Materialists,” meanwhile, may turn out to be a bait-and-switch for what is a deeper drama in the end, but early social sentiment was high even before reviews.) When they were talking about me — ‘this is the plan' — I got really excited. Similarly, I want to have a different experience releasing the movie.” As for the films and literature that inspired “Materialists” — which is so much caught up in the mathematics of love, its operations and behavior as an economically driven apparatus grounded in value, mutual exchange, and investment — it was Brooks, Ephron, even Billy Wilder. “There was a whole era where you just get to show up to a movie where people are going through things, and there's so much romance, and it's going to be about love because it's the thing we are all interested in. But Jane Austen, ever the literary master of tracing how romance also is and must be a kind of business deal pivoted around a woman's life station, also spoke to Song (whose academic studies have included psychology, philosophy, and playwriting) and “Materialists.” “Victorian romances are really in touch with the material reality and the pressures of marriage, the pressures of partnering, especially for women whose only way at the time to have any power or security or prosperity was through marriage,” she said. “In 2025, women can have jobs, they can have lucrative salaries, an amazing career, but amazingly, there's still material pressures of partnership that still pervade differently.” Women, she said, like Lucy, who is “not somebody who was born rich and feels like she has to fit into the wealthy world that allows her to do the work that she does. She's always going to live a little bit beyond her means, which is quite relatable for New Yorkers: You set a budget for rent, and then you end up paying $500 more,” Song said. Lucy, though, because of her job duties and past disappointments in love, can only at first see romance and marriage in terms of numbers, which is why when she meets Harry at a client's glitzy wedding, she grills him about his income, his height, and his background without even attempting to interrogate his essence as a person, his interests beyond the status signifiers that could make him a suitable match. As “Materialists” is a love story about singles navigating New York City, of course, “Sex and the City” and its own Austenian contemplations of the metrics of dating life and how wealth and privilege play a factor in courtship, come to mind not just among the audience but for Song, too. “The thing about ‘Sex and the City' is that now, sometimes you rewatch it, and you're like, ‘Those are some old ideas about gender! '” laughed Song, who like any romantic New Yorker or even aspiring ones raised herself artistically on the show to a degree, too. “But some of those things you realize, you grew up imagining what it is like to live in an unconventional way as a working woman. It's one of the longest-lasting [stories about] being a woman and also being a woman who is not necessarily likeable 100 percent of the time. There's some element where it was always completely relatable, and then you also fall in love with New York City through that show. “Sex and the City,” which Song praised as never “moralizing,” is about a fantasy of New York City, a fantasy of being a single person, and the kind of fantasy Song both tributes and even debunks in “Materialists.” Her film, though, takes us to parts of New York we didn't see in the HBO series or even now on its HBO Max counterpart “And Just Like That” or rarely in Manhattan love stories, like Brooklyn's Bushwick, where John stars in a new play (“Tom and Eliza,” named for Song's own 2016 prize-winning stage work), or the bayside Sunset Park, where he lives in a cramped three-bedroom with two chaotic roommates. “When I scripted it in 2022, I thought he would be living in Bushwick, and then, me and my location manager realized that Bushwick has been so far gentrified that it just wouldn't make any sense,” she said. “It would be too expensive for him. I don't give a fuck about this New York real estate. But that's why we were like, what's a place that's not fully gentrified, where as an actor you have two roommates and pay that much, and are in a sweet situation and can't move and the apartment's shitty?” Song may not give a fuck about New York real estate, but her movie is as interested in the balance sheets endemic to human romances as it is the emotions needed to sustain them at all. “Have you become so completely wrapped up in the numbers and the algorithm and the way that we objectify and commodify ourselves that that's what we're considering more real than true love?” Song wondered, pondering her movie's true theme. What does it mean to be a person right now? ‘Materialists' is really interested in the dating market. Now, the marriage market is on their phones. You can go to Instagram and compare your own value as a data point … in comparison to everyone else.” She continued, “There is an endless self-commodification and self-objectification. All the language we have around self-improvement, for example. Do you not want to invest in your face?' ‘You're going to look so much better. Everything comes down to Sophie's line: ‘I'm not merchandise. But the end of that is going to be dehumanization.” “Materialists” opens in theaters from A24 on Friday, June 13.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After facing multiple health challenges in recent years, longtime HGTV star Christina Haack is celebrating her latest lab results. “Today I found out my bloodwork is the best it's ever been,” Haack wrote in an update via her Instagram Stories on June 9, 2025, noting that she started seeing a “regenerative health practitioner” in 2018. Haack continued with her update, written in white text on a black background, “All my inflammation & autoimmune numbers are great. This just shows how much stress can truly negatively affect your health. Haack's results are a huge relief after several years of nerve-wracking health challenges and the stress of her third marriage ending in July 2024. And my highest level of toxicity came back as an abnormal amount of gut bacteria, which is like SIBO, and also parasites.” Haack shared a page of her test results at the time, which were ordered by her doctor at Lee Regenerative Medical Institute, an alternative medicine practice in Huntington Beach, California. But in 2021, she shared on Instagram that her “extreme stomach pain” had continued. “I wanted to fix the problem so I really focused on my nutrition and it seemed to get better but then last year it was triggered again and all of a sudden the stomach pain was back.” In April 2024, Haack shared that she'd made a “pretty disturbing” discovery about a root canal she'd had several years earlier, revealing in her Instagram Stories that she was going to have oral surgery for a lingering infection. “When I was 16, I had a tooth injury to a back molar and had to have an emergency root canal,” Haack wrote in her Stories. “In 2020, my dentist saw via xray the previous root canal showed signs of being infected. “I'm taking care of it next week via explant,” Haack told her fans, “but leaving an infection that long can cause all kinds of health complications. With no root you can't feel there is a problem.”</p>

Listen to the new song below. A pair of Baby Rose songs also feature on the soundtrack, which A24 Music is releasing alongside Daniel Pemberton's score. Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal, and Chris Evans star in the movie, which is out this Friday, June 13.

It features the singles “Orlando in Love,” “Picture Window,” “Mega Circuit,” and “Winter in LA.” She is currently midway through an international tour that returns to North America in August. Japanese Breakfast started her live run behind the new album with a special Coachella performance, during which she covered Gorillaz's dreamy 2010 song “On Melancholy Hill.” Read about Japanese Breakfast's “Be Sweet” in “The 100 Best Songs of the 2020s So Far.” Pitchfork may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Billboard joined Peggy backstage at Gov Ball, where he shared his thoughts on politics, fame and why rap fans "don't wanna hear Drake complain about b—hes anymore." During JPEGMAFIA‘s rambunctious set at this year's Governor's Ball, I watched as a young teenager stumbled out of the crowd, caked in sweat and mud. His glasses were fogged up, tilted at an angle across the pointed frame of his nose. He correcte them and looked at me and my friend I brought along for the day. See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news “Do NOT go in there,” he exclaimed, his face radiating the sort of joy that made me think he probably wanted me to ignore this warning. 'Democracy Forward' Compilation Features Tracks From Michael Stipe, Wilco, Brandi Carlile, John… As Peggy's set continued, I watched as young person after young person entered and exited the crowd in a dusty, sweaty and (in one case) bloody haze, all emanating the same joy. It was as if Peggy's mosh pit was a sort of exfoliant, revealing a newfound aliveness underneath those daring enough to try it out. Growing up, he was a ubiquitous presence in Baltimore's punk scene, and in turn has constantly toed the line between rap and hardcore. His latest two albums, 2024's I Lay Down My Life for You and 2023's Scaring the Hoes with Danny Brown are the closest Peggy's ever come to completely shattering that genre matrix. You realize just how deep the rabbit hole goes in terms of how music can be deconstructed and reconstructed. In the world of JPEGMAFIA, there are no boundaries. “There's no f—king rules, especially not in the music industry,” Peggy told me at his trailer just a few hours before his show. He's sitting in front of a full length mirror, tackling his skincare routine. All the contracts say we own you in all universes and then these n—as never been to Mars. I spoke with JPEGMAFIA about the Director's Cut of his latest album, his haters, his thoughts on the state of rap and how it feels to be labeled an underground rapper while shooting for superstardom. What inspired you to take a Directors Cut approach to I Lay Down My Life For You? I looked up the word directors cut after I saw that Justice League, whatever, Snyder Directors Cut s—t, and I was like s—t, we need a directors cut in music. Because I do direct all these albums. Cause you either do that for some old s—t or it's just being lazy. Cause I cut the fat off of it, so I put the original one back out. I love it and I got inspired from SZA cause she did Lana and she put a whole f—king new album at the front of that b—h and I'm just like, “Oh I didn't know you could do that.” Why choose these songs to be on the Directors Cut? You have one lyric on “Protect The Cross” I really wanna touch on where you say: “2025, your politics is a gang sign.” Tell me more about your thoughts on politics at this moment, and how that bar came together? When I say “your politics is a gang sign,” I meant it — because who you affiliate with now really says a lot about you. Trump has done more racist s—t in the last six months than I think Ronald Reagan did in his whole f—king career. John Oliver said this, but I'm gonna paraphrase him: If Ronald Reagan woke up from the dead and saw the racist s—t Trump did in the last six months, he would c-m so hard he'd die again. So It's just like, if you wanna support that, that says a lot about you. But if you're on the other side that also says a lot about you because the Democrats are a losing, f–ked party. So it really is a gang sign in the same way that gangs do that. Curious what the reception was to this album when it first came out? I know you've always had rock influences in your music, but there seems to be a lot more punk and noise energy in Lay Down My Life. I mean yeah, because they just wanna hate — and some people just don't like me, and they can't admit it, so they be tryna pretend because they don't like me the snares aren't hitting as hard or somethin'. [I Lay Down My Life for You] got the same reception it always does. N—as hated in the beginning, and [then] they was like, “Oh wait this is actually good.” Yeah, f—k you. That seems to be sort of a trend with your releases. When I released Scaring the Hoes people were like, “This is an abomination to music.” Now they asking me for Scaring The Hoes 2. I'm just theorizing, but maybe it's like a risk-taker type thing? I'm one of the only risk-takers in rap! I'm not here to give people the bare minimum and have that just be okay, n—a. I'm not wasting my potential like those motherf—kers. I'm 35 years old — and Tupac said when Black men turn 30, they lose their fire. I have no loss of fire. Y'all go do that boring ass s—t. I'm here to take this s—t forward whether y'all like it or not y'all can kiss my Black ass. And I've been doing it so well that people have to hate. They try to take the title from me and they just can't, because it's me. I'm me, It came from my brain. Keep imitating Earl, and making hyper-pop songs, whatever the f—k these n—as is doing. I'm gonna be doing my thing like I've been doing, 'cause clearly something is working. Going off that, how do you feel about the state of rap right now? Because you have choices from everywhere. 1 genre in the world, anybody can take off at any point off of one TikTok. I enjoy that s—t because it evens things out. I don't have the same resources as some of these motherf—kers do so I gotta go off my talent. Some of these motherf—kers come out here, and they just be havin' pyro and they be sitting in they f—king room on stage and all this dumb ass s—t and I'm like, ‘I don't wanna see all that s—t n—a, can you perform? I'm gonna come with the production. And I got in the music industry and I got better than all the f—king underground. I don't wanna be in the underground no more. How important is the live performance to you? When I first came in, I knew it was important to be a good live performer because it would make me stand out. And I came from the hardcore scene in Baltimore so I was used to that kinda s—t. I'm always gonna have my energy, I'm always gonna do that but it's not enough to carry you on forever. Eventually you got to, like, do some s—t that's interesting. My set now is like some Batman Returns s—t. There's a podium, because I was watching the Democratic National Convention and I was like, “Damn this s—t look crazy. Three drapes, and just a motherf—ker talkin' lookin important? I wanna keep evolving and growing, because I don't like being an underground rapper. Do people still try to put that on you? I just wanna blow past it so hard where you say it and you sound crazy. It'd be like calling Steve Lacy an underground rapper. Why do you wanna blow past it? You wanna be a superstar! Yes, and If I don't, fine, I'm fine being an underground rap legend, that's cool. But while I'm alive and active I'm gonna do everything to take this s—t to the top and not the middle. What do you see for the future of rap when it comes to fusing it with hardcore music? I think a lot of people are gonna jump on that because what people are gonna do is they're gonna realize what you guys are doing is boring as s—t. People yearn for something new, especially in rap. We don't wanna hear Drake complain about b—hes anymore. I'm here to try to provide and cultivate that as much as I can because rap fans are f—king bored. Their idea of doing something different is taking different sounding s—t and throwing trap drums on it, and that's not what I'm here to do. I'm here to really f—k you up. I've seen plenty of it, but then I see guys like Matt Proxy from Minneapolis. He came out of my influence and he shows love and respect, but for some reason some of these guys, they come at me like we beefing or something. I'm not your f—king friend and I don't know you, and If you come up to me I'll slap the s—t out of you. I see people d—k riding and copying, but they don't wanna give homage, because it's me and they're offended by something I say or do. It's the same reason you won't see me on certain festivals because certain n—as don't want me to be on that s—t. It seems like you're very aware of all of these things that are going on. Him and Bianca, every day, just looking at it. I'm not on my subreddit, but he was in there — because he was using it for, like, criticism and to be like, “Oh let me fix this.” Do you think there's still a lot of misunderstanding surrounding who JPEGMAFIA is? People are kinda coming around, I see it a little bit. Because before it was literally just white teenagers projecting their insecurities on to me, and I was like, “Y'all realize I'm not a 15-year-old white boy in my house with my mom, right?” I'm a 35-year-old man and I run a business. I don't mind, it's not [about] being white. It's the people that take that and try to remove my Blackness to make their little narratives sound better. It's just like, that's not real. I'm not doing anything egregious right now. I'm not getting on Twitter to say anything crazy, and when I do get on Twitter to say something crazy it's to promote an album. People just fall for it so well, you know? But I see a lot of people turning the tide and being like, “Okay, maybe this n—a just likes to make music, and his personality is not a white teenage boy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jonathan Mayers, a co-founder of Superfly Entertainment who also served as a co-founder of game-changing music festivals like Bonnaroo and Outside Lands, has died, Billboard and a Bonnaroo representative confirmed to Pitchfork He was 51. After growing up a short drive from New York and graduating from Tulane University, in 1995, Mayers immersed himself in the music world through work at the storied New Orleans institutions Tipitina's and Jazz Fest. In 1996, he co-founded the promotion company Superfly Entertainment with Rick Farman, Richard Goodstone, and Kerry Black. The group organized its first concert—the Meters, Maceo Parker, and Rebirth Brass Band—during Mardi Gras, before setting sights on bigger ideas. The four co-founders partnered with promoter Ashley Capps of AC Entertainment, agent Chip Hooper of Paradigm Talent Agency, and manager Coran Capshaw of Red Light Management, and the rest was history. In a few years' time, Bonnaroo would not only inspire dozens of music festivals across America, but also serve as the blueprint for how to rethink music festivals in the modern era under tighter restrictions compared to the Woodstock era. Just a few years later, Superfly started Vegoose, an annual Halloween music and arts festival, with multi-venue programming across Las Vegas in 2005. That multi-genre, multi-day music festival grew to become the largest independently owned music festival in the United States. In addition to starting other events around the country, like the comedy-focused festival Clusterfest in San Francisco in 2017, Mayers also turned his attention toward film and TV rights holders to start immersive experiences for fans. By licensing rights from popular shows like Friends, Seinfeld, The Office, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and more, Mayers and his team recreated TV sets in various cities that allowed fans to “step inside” their favorite series. In January 2023, a New York judge dismissed the lawsuit. Mayers went on to focus on Core City Detroit, a new project investing in a music campus for local artists that also could host public events.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The actors and 'SmartLess' podcast hosts are launching a new mobile brand, which will focus on value. SmartLess hosts and creators Jason Bateman, Will Arnett and Sean Hayes are launching a new mobile phone brand called SmartLess Mobile Tuesday, betting that their success in reaching people through their phones can lead to a piece of the mobile business. “Our SmartLess podcast now reaches millions of listeners each month, almost all of whom listen on their phones,” said Bateman in a statement. “Extending the SmartLess brand into mobile is a logical next step.” John Lithgow on Why Dumbledore Role in Harry Potter Series Won't Be "That Hard a Job" SmartLess Mobile is also working with wireless industry veterans Paul and Jeni McAleese, along with lead investor Thomvest Asset Management on the new venture. SmartLess Mobile is leveraging eSim technology, which lets users sign up or switch plans just by scanning a QR code. Seriously, if your phone bill knew how often you're on Wi-Fi, it would be embarrassed.” “You're paying for way more data than you use, and we're pretty sure that Big Wireless isn't going to let you know that your phone isn't using their network the vast majority of the time. Celebrities have been able to leverage the opportunity of direct-to-consumer to launch a number of major businesses, and Arnett, Hayes and Bateman are just the latest in a long line of stars to do so.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But on June 9, 2025, King revealed that those friends were still there for him as he spent several days in the hospital. King, 23, posted a photo of himself in his hospital bed flanked by two friends from “American Idol” — Skylie Marie Thompson, who made it to the Hollywood Week Showstopper round, and top 24 singer Grayson Torrence. They were part of a songwriting retreat that King had traveled to Virginia to be part of, hosted by another Hollywood Week contestant, Nina Daig, he wrote on Instagram. Daig's husband took King to the hospital, where they found his resting heart rate was high, a “steady 125-130 bpm for most of Saturday,” he wrote, “and any ounce of movement hurt like hell.” “I don't quite know what it was exactly,” King shared, adding that the doctors diagnosed him with SIRS, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which the Cleveland Clinic describes as “a life-threatening medical emergency caused by your body's overwhelming response to a stressor” which can include an “infection, trauma or a worsening health condition.” “The doctor said there was a ton of strain on my heart as a result,” King wrote, “and I had to be monitored for the next two nights. The cause was a combination of things, dehydration, fatigue, stress, heat exhaustion, etc.” King, who performed on the “American Idol” season finale with Jessica Simpson, concluded his post by writing, “Idol family was there for me once again when I needed them :)” Torrence posted a selfie video on the night of June 9 to tell fans, “Josh is doing a lot better, he's out of the hospital,” but that he would be staying in Virginia for several days and they'd be able to work on songs as he recovers. She encouraged fans to leave kind words and prayers for him in the comment section of his post. Canaan James Hill, who was attending the BET Awards, wrote, “Glad to hear you're okay brother!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sharon Osbourne has revealed that she removed a band from the lineup of Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne's highly anticipated Back to the Beginning concert, set to take place on July 5 at Villa Park in Birmingham, England. Quincy Jones Remembered by Lucky Daye, Luke James & Miles Caton With Smooth 2025 BET Awards Tribute “And it was probably the worst way I've felt in years. And I don't care what this person says about me, thinks about it, because he doesn't know me. And he's now going around making up bulls— lies because I threw his band off the bill.” While speculation initially arose that the band in question was Iron Maiden after she clashed with Bruce Dickinson during the 2005 edition of Ozzfest, Osbourne swiftly dismissed this. Ozzy only has respect for the guys in Maiden,” she said, clarifying that Ozzy was unaware of Dickinson's behavior until after the incident. “I never told him, until the night that it happened when it was the last show, and he just looked at me and goes, ‘You're terrible. Speculation also briefly pointed toward Tool due to their name initially missing from promotional materials for the event's global livestream. However, it was later confirmed that the omission was merely a design oversight, and Tool is still set to perform. Osbourne emphasized her indifference to industry criticism, noting, “I don't care what people say. “I haven't done any physical work for the last seven, six and a half, seven years,” Ozzy said, promising that “by hook or by crook, I'm gonna make it [to the stage at Villa Park],” where Black Sabbath's final gig will find them joined by an all-star roster that will also include Metallica, Mastodon, Anthrax, Pantera, Alice in Chains, Gojira, Slayer and a supergroup featuring members of Guns N' Roses, the Smashing Pumpkins, Limp Bizkit, Judas Priest, Rage Against the Machine and many more. “I've got this trainer guy who helps people get back to normal,” he said of the intense training he's undergoing following a rough several years that included spinal surgery and a Parkinson's disease diagnosis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The “Pleasure Shop” singer, a member of legendary boy group SHINee, wants to show younger K-pop artists they can have a lengthy career: “A lot of good things happened to my own career that I couldn't imagine. And everything happened after [I was] 30 years old.” K-pop star Key is never one to sit idle. The 33-year-old, a member of the iconic boy group SHINee, finds himself performing as a group member, creating as a solo artist, starring in multiple reality TV shows and still finding time to have moments to himself. “I think every person has their own 12 identities or something,” the singer jokes to The Hollywood Reporter backstage at his music agency SM Entertainment's SMTown Live L.A. He goes on to explain that every person takes on a different identity in a different situation, and that's how he's been able to tackle his many roles as a household name in Korea. Secretly Group Acquires 50 Percent Stake in Merge Records Mariah Carey Signs Multi-Album Deal With Gamma Below, the K-pop star gets honest about growing older in the industry, what kind of music he's looking to create next and what he's most excited about when visiting L.A. this summer for KCON. How does it feel to be back in L.A. after some time? I [completed my] military service and [there was] also [the] pandemic. But I've always missed [our] American fans, and of course, I always miss L.A. Two days ago I felt – I don't know why – but something's changed a lot. [It's the] same, but different. When I saw the fans with my own eyes today, It was heartwarming. Actually, I'm not sure, but I'm in the planning stages for my American tour. As SHINee, I want to come here often, too. In the last six years, K-pop has become increasingly more popular in the U.S. There's just more of a demand for artists to come perform here than there was six to 10 years ago. Have you noticed a difference in that atmosphere? K-Pop started [gaining popularity in the U.S.] 15 or 16 years ago. I thought it was kind of sort of a syndrome or something, like anime music. Like a few really dedicated fans. But five to six years ago, K-pop was popular. People dance to [a] Vietnamese song on TikTok… It doesn't matter [to] this generation. I'm kind of glad, actually That must be more freeing to you as an artist. In the past if you couldn't understand the lyrics, people didn't listen, you know what I mean? But these days, [it's] totally different. I think it changed a lot. It depends on [the] artist's expression, singing English or singing Korean, it's freeing. I feel more free even now than before as an artist. Naturally, you've grown into adulthood, but I'm wondering if even over the last few years since you were discharged from the military, if you've noticed a change in how you perform? I couldn't imagine it, honestly. People said that a lot. All the senior artists said it's not that long [and] lasting [in a] group is really hard. I heard those kind of things a lot in the past, but now I'm 34 [Korean age] and I'm still doing the same thing. That kind of generation has changed, and I want to show to my junior artists, you guys can do this too [into your 30s], the same [way] you did before. A lot of good things happened to my own career that I couldn't imagine. And everything happened after [I was] 30 years old. You're playing KCON L.A. this summer. How are you feeling about that? I feel really good that I made a promise to all my U.S. fans. I'm coming back really soon. Actually this time we were in Mexico [right before], and we came here straight from Mexico, so I couldn't enjoy Los Angeles. I couldn't enjoy that much, but performing is enough for me, actually. I want take more pictures. I want to show everyone [my trip]. Pleasure Shop was your last release. It still very much feels like a Key song, but it's a little different from some of your past releases. In K-pop, you can mix everything, all the cultures, all the genres and all the videos into one album. But even I don't know what I want to do next. I think it depends on that year's whole environment and vibes and trends. I can pick some ideas from my past. Maybe it'll happen like that. But this year, as a human Kibum [his given name], Pleasure Shop was kind of mild for me. I want to do something stronger. I miss Gasoline so much, so I'm going to bring that again on an album in plan this year. I think every person has their own 12 identities or something. Each person, not even just celebrities. You know what I mean? When I'm in a bad mood, I can be a bad kid. It happens because I'm a human too. In some way, maybe you won't believe this, but I'm kind of shy. You can't just express one identity. I'm a Michael [Jackson] on stage. When I'm in a magazine. It's almost the same in private too. There's no more, who am I? What kind of artist is Key? There's a lot of me. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Send us a tip using our anonymous form.</p>
