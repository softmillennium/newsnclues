                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has refused to answer questions on the cost of deploying Marines to L.A. when asked by the subcommittee's top Democrat. Rep. Betty McCollum said “this is a deeply unfair position to put our Marines in.“ During an Oval Office engagement with reporters, President Donald Trump left open the possibility of invoking one the most extreme emergency powers in response to immigration protests in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, after persistent questioning from members of Congress on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth‘s acting comptroller, Bryn Woollacott MacDonnell, shared that it would cost $134 million to send the National Guard and Marines to the protests. Soldiers at Fort Cavazos in Texas had a fun pre-parade assignment: Test if the metal plating planned to protect Washington D.C.'s streets is strong enough for an Abrams. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Tuesday ordered U.S. embassies around the world to move ahead on a State directive to fire all remaining U.S. Agency for International Development staffers by Sept. 30. The State Department will take over all foreign assistance programs from USAID by Monday, Rubio said in a cable sent to embassies and viewed by The Associated Press. The president started off his visit to Ft. Bragg with a demonstration of military hardware, including the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, and troops demonstrating a helicopter assault and building raid. HIMARS, a precision-guided rocket launcher system, are among the most pivotal weapon system the U.S. has provided Ukraine since Russia launched its brutal invasion in February 2022. Near a security checkpoint — but still on the base — vendors set up two stands selling Trump campaign paraphernalia like hats and shirts. There is a “resurgence of pride” in America. “We are here not just as Californians but as Americans who are concerned with the direction of our country,” said Rep. Jimmy Gomez, who represents the Los Angeles area. “We are at a dangerous inflection point in our country,” Gomez said. “In a democracy, civil disobedience isn't met with military force. Nanette Barragan, whose district includes the city of Paramount, said, “Listen to the words of this administration: They're using words like insurrection. “That's a concern,” she said, explaining such an order could encompass the entire country. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem on Tuesday accused Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum of inciting violence in Los Angeles protests, despite the Mexican leader repeatedly calling on protesters to act peacefully. She should not be encouraging violent protests that are going on,” Noem said during an appearance in the Oval Office on Tuesday. The accusation invoked a strong response from Sheinbaum, who called the claims “absolutely false,” in a post on the social media platform X. Sheinbaum posted a video from her morning press briefing in which she called for peaceful protests, referring to Noem's comments as a “misunderstanding.” “We do not agree with violent actions as a form of protest, the burning of patrol cars seems more an act of provocation than resistance, it should be clear, we condemn violence, wherever it comes from, we call on the Mexican community to act peacefully and not fall into provocations,” she said in the press briefing. In her response to Noem, Sheinbaum added that she will “continue to defend honest, hard working Mexicans who support the United States economy,” and called for “dialogue and respect.” The full bill can be found on Congress's website. If it's still a bit confusing (we don't blame you), AP's Kevin Freking and Lisa Mascaro wrote their own breakdown of the bill. (One big caveat: the bill is expected to change before final votes). The Capitol is seen in Washington, as Republicans work on legislation to advance President Donald Trump's spending and tax bill, Tuesday, June 10, 2025. Vice President JD Vance met at the Capitol on Tuesday with Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, according to a person familiar with the meeting who was not authorized to speak publicly. Johnson is a Republican who has been very critical of Trump's bill to cut taxes and spending, arguing the legislation does not do enough to cut government spending. Viral social media posts falsely claimed the ad was proof the Los Angeles demonstrations are made up of paid protestors. The ad, which is no longer live, was bait for a prank show called “Goofcon1” and had nothing to do with the protests in Los Angeles. “I literally had no idea it was ever going to be connected to the riots,” LaFleur told AP, referencing the ad. I'm not trying to troll a serious situation.” Rep. David Valadao, a moderate Republican who represents much of the state's San Joaquin Valley, expressed concern over the scenes in Los Angeles and urged for peaceful protest. He added that he had expressed concerns to the Trump administration over how it is conducting ICE raids in the Golden state. “I support the First Amendment right to peacefully protest, but the violence and vandalism happening in Los Angeles is unacceptable and I stand with our law enforcement officers working to protect people and regain control over the situation,” Valadao wrote on social media. Experts had predicted the process could take many months or even years, but AI was able to quickly scan for any material that should remain classified, Gabbard told the audience at the Amazon Web Services summit Tuesday. “We have been able to do that through the use of AI tools far more quickly than what was done previously — which was to have humans go through and look at every single one of these pages,” Gabbard said. Law enforcement officers in riot gear patrol a street near Los Angeles City Hall in downtown Los Angeles on Monday, June 9, 2025. Trump said he isn't worried about things getting out of hand with the military on the ground in Los Angeles. Asked if he was concerned, Trump said, “No, it's OK.” “If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. It is often referred to as the “Insurrection Act of 1807,” but the law is actually an amalgamation of different statutes enacted by Congress between 1792 and 1871. Trump has been critical of FEMA over the last year and has spread misinformation about it, especially regarding its assistance in North Carolina in the wake of Hurricane Helene. Trump said disaster management is meant to be handled by governors. President Donald Trump speaks to the media in the Oval Office at the White House, Tuesday, June 10, 2025, in Washington, as Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, look on. The event wasn't on Trump's public schedule, but the Agriculture and Homeland Security secretaries talked about fighting wildfires and hurricanes. Trump is sitting at his desk while the officials talk. The president has cut firefighting crews and also wants to eliminate FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Administration and give states more responsibility for responding to hurricanes. Sanders, who was press secretary in Trump's first term, is meeting with administration officials at the White House. She backs Trump sending the National Guard into Los Angeles without approval from California's governor and was asked if she'd be OK with a similar move in her state. “If we needed help, I would be making the phone call myself to the president and asking for his assistance. But if we needed help, the president would be one of the first people I would call because he is somebody I know who cares deeply about making sure the American people are safe and secure first and foremost.” And she says she's working to speed up the delivery of the intelligence information to address a key complaint from policy makers. Speaking at the Amazon Web Services summit in Washington, Gabbard said the pace of intelligence work frustrated her as a member of Congress and continues to be a challenge to lawmakers. “They still express a lot of the same frustrations that I felt — that much of what we were briefed on was already reported in a newspaper … and that even if it was quality reporting it was coming too late,” Gabbard said. Artificial intelligence and computing could help speed up the work, Gabbard said, to ensure lawmakers have the information they need. “We stated very publicly that it's 60 days because we want to ensure that those rioters, looters and thugs on the other side assaulting our police officers know that we're not going anywhere,” Hegseth told members of the House appropriations defense subcommittee. That could mean Kyiv will receive fewer critical air defense systems in the future that have been key to countering a continuous onslaught of Russian missiles. “It is a reduction in this budget,” Hegseth told lawmakers. “This administration takes a very different view of that conflict. departs a news conference after defending President Donald Trump's handling of protests in Los Angeles near the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, June 10, 2025. And he echoed the president's attacks on Democratic California Gov. “That's not my lane,” Johnson said in response to a question about whether Newsom should face legal consequences such as arrest. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Tuesday there were “clear failures on the part of state and local officials” in response to protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles and a “federal response” was necessary. President Trump has sent thousands of National Guard troops and 700 active duty Marines to quell the protests despite the objections of Democratic Gov. And I think ultimately the president's objective is to keep people safe.” “I think we're entering another phase, especially under President Trump with his focus on the homeland, where the National Guard and reserves become a critical component of how we secure that homeland,” Hegseth told lawmakers. Hegseth earlier refused to answer a lawmaker's questions on how much a deployment of active duty U.S. Marines to Los Angeles will cost. Activist Greta Thunberg arrives from Israel at Charles de Gaulle airport, north of Paris, Tuesday, June 10, 2025. After the activist joined a flotilla seeking to break Israel's blockade of Gaza and bring humanitarian aid to Palestinians, the U.S. president described Thunberg as a ''young, angry person.'' He said she should go to ''anger management class.'' Thunberg was detained then deported by Israel on Tuesday and sent to Paris. Asked upon arrival about Trump's comments, she replied in a matter-of-fact tone: “I think the world needs a lot more young angry women to be honest. Gen. Eric Smith testified at a budget hearing before senators that those Marines are trained for crowd control and they would have shields and batons as their equipment. When asked by Sen. Richard Blumental, a Connecticut Democrat, about the danger Marines would use lethal force that could result in injuries and deaths, Smith said he had faith in them. I have great faith in my Marines and their junior leaders and their more senior leaders to execute the lawful tasks that they are given.” The attack in early June that destroyed a large number of Russian bomber aircraft caught the U.S. off guard and represented significant advances in drone warfare, Hegseth told lawmakers Tuesday. Hegseth said the Pentagon “is learning everyday from Ukraine,” and focused on how to better defend its own military airfields. In a back an forth with the defense appropriations subcommittee's top Democrat, Hegseth refused to answer basic questions on the cost of deploying Marines to Los Angeles, instead falling back on political talking points. In a series of questions on the news that Marines would be sent to Los Angeles, House Appropriations defense subcommittee ranking member Rep. Betty McCollum told Hegseth “this is a deeply unfair position to put our Marines in,” she said. “There's no need for the Marines to be deployed.” McCollum took back her time and Hegseth was instructed by the committee chairman to provide the costs in writing instead. “It's a deliberate attempt by Trump to incite unrest, test the limits of executive power and distract from the lawlessness of his administration,” said Rep. Jimmy Gomez, who organized a news conference at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday morning. Rep. Nancy Pelosi contrasted Trump's actions now with his handling of the Jan. 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol when law enforcement officers were being beaten. Based on his opening remarks in his first appearance before lawmakers since taking office, there's been nothing but smooth sailing in the defense chief's office. Trump's defense chief faced a litany of questions on what some lawmakers called “rash” or “reckless” decisions or actions dating back to his first day in office, as Tuesday's hearing before the House Appropriations defense subcommittee began. In opening statements, lawmakers asked about Hegseth's decisions to fire top military leaders, his use of Signal and other controversies, including his firing of several staff members in his inner circle. Citing “a substantial rise in trade barriers'' but without mentioning Trump by name, the 189-country lender predicted that the U.S. economy — the world's largest — would grow half as fast (1.4%) this year as it did in 2024 (2.8%). The bank also lopped 0.4 percentage points off its forecast for global growth this year. He wrote on his social media site that people want to rebuild, and that the federal permitting process is “virtually complete on these houses.” Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. Call your incompetent Governor and Mayor, the Federal permitting is DONE!! He's expected to field sharp questions from members of Congress about his tumultuous start as Pentagon chief, including his sharing of sensitive military details over a Signal chat, in three separate Capitol Hill hearings beginning Tuesday. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth meets with Polish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz at the Pentagon, Tuesday, May 27, 2025 in Washington. Lawmakers also have made it clear they're unhappy that Hegseth hasn't provided details on the administration's first proposed defense budget, which Trump has said would total $1 trillion, a significant increase over the current spending level of more than $800 billion. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks during a press conference about Utah's new fluoride ban, food additives and SNAP funds legislation, Monday, April 7, 2025, in Salt Lake City. Kennedy on Monday removed every member of a scientific committee that advises the CDC on how to use vaccines and pledged to replace them with his own picks. Major physicians and public health groups criticized the move to oust all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Kennedy, who was one of the nation's leading anti-vaccine activists before becoming the nation's top health official, has not said who he would appoint to the panel, but said it would convene in just two weeks in Atlanta. Although it's typically not viewed as a partisan board, the entire current roster of committee members were Biden appointees. The fulfillment of that pledge is now on full display in Los Angeles. Gavin Newsom, Trump is already going beyond what he did to respond to Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, when he warned he could send troops to contain demonstrations that turned violent if governors in the states did not act to do so themselves. Trump said in September of that year that he “can't call in the National Guard unless we're requested by a governor” and that “we have to go by the laws.” But now, he's moving swiftly to test the bounds of his executive authority in order to deliver on his promise of mass deportations. What remains to be seen is whether Americans will stand by him once it's operationalized nationwide. For now, Trump is betting that they will. ▶ Read more about Trump's efforts to fulfill his immigration promises Mike Lee, who served at Fort Bragg, looks at the sign that was unveiled when Fort Liberty was rededicated as Fort Bragg during a ceremony on base, Friday, March 7, 2025, (AP Photo/Chris Seward) Trump plans to speak at Fort Bragg on Tuesday to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army as he deploys the military in an attempt to quiet immigration protests in Los Angeles. Fort Bragg, located near Fayetteville, North Carolina, serves as headquarters for U.S. Army Special Operations Command. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll will also be at Tuesday's event, along with service members, veterans and their families. Trump has promoted the Army's anniversary as a reason to hold a military parade in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, which is also his 79th birthday. Trump, who sees the military as a critical tool for domestic goals, has used the recent protests in Los Angeles as an opportunity to deploy the National Guard and U.S. Marines to quell disturbances that began as protests over immigration raids.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Another 2,000 National Guard troops along with 700 Marines are headed to Los Angeles on orders from President Donald Trump, escalating a military presence local officials have said creates logistical challenges for safely handling protests. Mayor Karen Bass criticized the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines as a “deliberate attempt” by the Trump administration to “create disorder and chaos in our city.” Protests took place in pockets across Los Angeles over several days after the Trump administration stepped up immigration control efforts in the city. In an unprecedented move, U.S. President Donald Trump deployed National Guard troops, a move strongly criticised by the city's officials and the Governor of California Gavin Newsom.

Newsom's move comes after President Donald Trump ordered the deployment of roughly 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angles following protests driven by anger over the president's stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws. That support would include holding secure perimeters around areas where raids are taking place and securing streets for immigration agents. The Guard members were originally deployed to protect federal buildings. It was not clear if the change in mission had begun. The 700 Marines and another 2,000 National Guard troops were ordered to LA on Monday, escalating a military presence that local officials and Gov. A convoy of buses moves along Interstate Highway 10 after leaving the Marine Corps base in Twentynine Palms, Calif, Monday, June 9, 2025, near Redlands, Calif. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull) Marine Corps Gen. Eric Smith told a budget hearing on Capitol Hill that the battalion has not yet been sent to any protests. The Marines were trained for crowd control but have no arrest authority and are there to protect government property and personnel, he said. It's one of the most extreme emergency powers available to a U.S. president. “If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We'll see,” he said Tuesday from the Oval Office. Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth. On Monday, they were far less raucous, with thousands of people peacefully attending a rally at City Hall and hundreds more protesting outside a federal complex that includes a detention center where some immigrants are being held following workplace raids across the city. Obscene slogans directed at Trump and federal law enforcement remained scrawled across several buildings. At the Walt Disney Concert Hall, workers were busy washing away graffiti Tuesday morning. In nearby Santa Ana, armored guard vehicles blocked a road leading to federal immigration and government offices. Workers swept up plastic bottles and broken glass near buildings sprayed with graffiti. Los Angeles police officers with batons and riot gear attempt to move back protesters in downtown Los Angeles on Monday, June 9, 2025. “I think we're entering another phase, especially under President Trump with his focus on the homeland, where the National Guard and Reserves become a critical component of how we secure that homeland,” he said on Capitol Hill. Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said he was confident in the police department's ability to handle large-scale demonstrations and that the Marines' arrival without coordinating with the police department would present a “significant logistical and operational challenge.” “This isn't about public safety,” the governor said. The protests began Friday after federal immigration authorities arrested more than 40 people across Los Angeles and continued over the weekend as crowds blocked a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire. Police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades. Demonstrations spread Monday to other cities nationwide, including San Francisco and Santa Ana, California, as well as Dallas and Austin, Texas. Authorities in Austin said police used pepper spray balls and tear gas to disperse a crowd that threw rocks and bottles at officers, injuring four. That figure came out Tuesday just after Hegseth engaged in a testy back-and-forth about the costs during a congressional hearing. Meanwhile, Democratic members of California's congressional delegation on Tuesday accused the president of creating a “manufactured crisis” with his orders to send in troops. Rep. Nancy Pelosi contrasted Trump's actions with his handling of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol when law enforcement officers were beaten. He sought an order declaring Trump's use of the Guard unlawful and asking for a restraining order to halt the deployment. U.S. officials said the Marines were needed to protect federal buildings and personnel, including immigration agents. A convoy of buses with blacked-out windows and escorted by sheriff's vehicles arrived overnight at a Navy facility just south of LA. Despite their presence, there has been limited engagement so far between the Guard and protesters while local law enforcement implements crowd control. Law enforcement officers in riot gear patrol a street near Los Angeles City Hall in downtown Los Angeles on Monday, June 9, 2025. Thousands flooded the streets around City Hall for a union rally Monday before labor leader David Huerta was freed on a bond after he was arrested Friday while protesting the immigration raids. As the crowd thinned, police began pushing protesters away, firing crowd-control munitions as people chanted, “Peaceful protest.” At least a dozen people were surrounded by police and detained. Several dozen people were arrested throughout the weekend. The deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts. The last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.</p>

Rosa DeLauro grilled Secretary Pete Hegseth on his plans for speeding up the nation's lagging shipbuilding process, saying the previous administration was similarly opaque about its plans Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., confronted Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth during a heated House Appropriations Committee hearing Tuesday over years-long lags in the nation's shipbuilding capacity. The top Appropriations Democrat accused the Defense Department (DOD) of failing to present a clear, transparent plan to ramp up production at a time when China's shipbuilding capabilities are estimated to be 230 times greater than the U.S.'s. She said the Biden administration had been similarly opaque. DeLauro zeroed in on what she characterized as a troubling shortfall between the Navy's current production capacity and future strategic needs. "Do you know where our submarine production currently stands and whether current production is sufficient to bridge the gap between current fleet size and projected need?" Rep. Rosa DeLauro confronted Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth during a heated House Appropriations Committee hearing Tuesday over years-long lags in the nation's shipbuilding capacity. But DeLauro wasn't satisfied, demanding detailed data to back up that claim. "We do not have any information or data that can substantiate what you're saying," she shot back. "We've had difficulty with the prior administration, and I don't mind calling them out. What is your plan for the future?" China's shipbuilding capacity is estimated to be 230x greater than the U.S. (US Navy via AP) "This creates a serious problem for industry in the short term and hampers shipbuilders' ability to reach an adequate production rate," DeLauro warned. "Have you been in contact with Electric Boat or Huntington Ingalls about your plans?" Hegseth pushed back, saying top Pentagon officials were in regular communication with shipyards. "We're actively engaged… to make sure their needs are being met and their shortfalls are being addressed so we can close that gap in real time." DeLauro pointed to a missed deadline for placing key submarine contracts authorized under the December continuing resolution. Congress had approved $5.7 billion for two Block IV and one Block V Virginia-class submarines, with the understanding that contracts would be in place by February 2025. "We have made a serious investment," DeLauro said. Pete Hegseth admitted of the nation's shipbuilding capacity and its needs  (REUTERS/Annabelle Gordon) When pressed for specifics, Hegseth thanked the committee for its flexibility and acknowledged prior mismanagement under previous administrations. "Can we get that in writing and on paper? Because we don't have anything today. The Navy currently operates under 50 attack submarines, well below the long-term requirement of 66 boats, as outlined by recent Navy force structure assessments. Shipyards like Electric Boat (General Dynamics) in Connecticut and Huntington Ingalls Industries in Virginia and Mississippi are the primary builders of nuclear submarines—but both are operating near maximum capacity and face major workforce and supply chain challenges. Shipbuilding's highly specialized supply chain was hit especially hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and has been slow to recover.

(AP) — Rangers hiked 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) overnight to confirm the deaths of two people who were camping at an island national park in Michigan's Lake Superior, authorities said Tuesday. “The causes of death are unknown at this time. The incident is currently under investigation,” Isle Royale National Park said in a statement. Two rangers set out Sunday night after park staff was informed that two people were dead at a remote campground. They reached the site Monday. A phone message left with park authorities seeking more information Tuesday was not immediately returned. Isle Royale is an extraordinary wilderness park, accessible only by ferry, personal boat or seaplane and only open six months a year due to extreme weather. The island's population of moose and wolves is regularly studied by wildlife scientists.</p>

President Donald Trump issued a word of caution for anyone who attempts to protest the military parade he is putting on to commemorate the U.S. Army's 250th birthday in Washington. "If there's any protest once they come out, they will be met with very big force," Trump told reporters Tuesday. "I haven't even heard about a protest. But people that hate our country … they will be met with very heavy force." Trump issued a word of caution for anyone who attempts to protest his military parade. The event will be held Saturday, and will feature flyovers, historical reenactments, military vehicles and other "moving tributes" honoring service members, according to America250, a nonpartisan initiative working to engage Americans in the U.S.' 250th anniversary. "It's going to be an amazing day," Trump said Tuesday. And I think it's going to be great. We're going to celebrate our country for a change." U.S. Army soldiers march during a military parade on Armed Forces Day in Vilnius, Lithuania, Nov. 25, 2023. Trump's comments coincide with massive protests and riots in Los Angeles stemming from recent arrests in the city by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. While state governors usually oversee National Guard troops, Trump invoked a law to place the troops under federal command. "I have formally requested the Trump Administration rescind their unlawful deployment of troops in Los Angeles county and return them to my command," Newsom wrote on X Sunday. "We didn't have a problem until Trump got involved. This is a serious breach of state sovereignty — inflaming tensions while pulling resources from where they're actually needed."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has refused to answer questions on the cost of deploying Marines to L.A. when asked by the subcommittee's top Democrat. Rep. Betty McCollum said “this is a deeply unfair position to put our Marines in.“ After persistent questioning from members of Congress on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth turned to his acting comptroller, Bryn Woollacott MacDonnell, who provided the amount it would cost to send the National Guard and Marines to immigration protests in Los Angeles. She said the $134 million will come from operations and maintenance accounts. Rep. David Valadao, a moderate Republican who represents much of the state's San Joaquin Valley, expressed concern over the scenes in Los Angeles and urged for peaceful protest. He added that he had expressed concerns to the Trump administration over how it is conducting ICE raids in the Golden state. “I support the First Amendment right to peacefully protest, but the violence and vandalism happening in Los Angeles is unacceptable and I stand with our law enforcement officers working to protect people and regain control over the situation,” Valadao wrote on social media. Experts had predicted the process could take many months or even years, but AI was able to quickly scan for any material that should remain classified, Gabbard told the audience at the Amazon Web Services summit Tuesday. “We have been able to do that through the use of AI tools far more quickly than what was done previously — which was to have humans go through and look at every single one of these pages,” Gabbard said. Law enforcement officers in riot gear patrol a street near Los Angeles City Hall in downtown Los Angeles on Monday, June 9, 2025. Trump said he isn't worried about things getting out of hand with the military on the ground in Los Angeles. Asked if he was concerned, Trump said, “No, it's OK.” “If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. It is often referred to as the “Insurrection Act of 1807,” but the law is actually an amalgamation of different statutes enacted by Congress between 1792 and 1871. Trump has been critical of FEMA over the last year and has spread misinformation about it, especially regarding its assistance in North Carolina in the wake of Hurricane Helene. Trump said disaster management is meant to be handled by governors. The event wasn't on Trump's public schedule, but the Agriculture and Homeland Security secretaries talked about fighting wildfires and hurricanes. Trump is sitting at his desk while the officials talk. The president has cut firefighting crews and also wants to eliminate FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Administration and give states more responsibility for responding to hurricanes. Sanders, who was press secretary in Trump's first term, is meeting with administration officials at the White House. She backs Trump sending the National Guard into Los Angeles without approval from California's governor and was asked if she'd be OK with a similar move in her state. “If we needed help, I would be making the phone call myself to the president and asking for his assistance. But if we needed help, the president would be one of the first people I would call because he is somebody I know who cares deeply about making sure the American people are safe and secure first and foremost.” And she says she's working to speed up the delivery of the intelligence information to address a key complaint from policy makers. Speaking at the Amazon Web Services summit in Washington, Gabbard said the pace of intelligence work frustrated her as a member of Congress and continues to be a challenge to lawmakers. “They still express a lot of the same frustrations that I felt — that much of what we were briefed on was already reported in a newspaper … and that even if it was quality reporting it was coming too late,” Gabbard said. Artificial intelligence and computing could help speed up the work, Gabbard said, to ensure lawmakers have the information they need. “We stated very publicly that it's 60 days because we want to ensure that those rioters, looters and thugs on the other side assaulting our police officers know that we're not going anywhere,” Hegseth told members of the House appropriations defense subcommittee. That could mean Kyiv will receive fewer critical air defense systems in the future that have been key to countering a continuous onslaught of Russian missiles. “It is a reduction in this budget,” Hegseth told lawmakers. “This administration takes a very different view of that conflict. And he echoed the president's attacks on Democratic California Gov. “That's not my lane,” Johnson said in response to a question about whether Newsom should face legal consequences such as arrest. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Tuesday there were “clear failures on the part of state and local officials” in response to protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles and a “federal response” was necessary. President Trump has sent thousands of National Guard troops and 700 active duty Marines to quell the protests despite the objections of Democratic Gov. And I think ultimately the president's objective is to keep people safe.” “I think we're entering another phase, especially under President Trump with his focus on the homeland, where the National Guard and reserves become a critical component of how we secure that homeland,” Hegseth told lawmakers. Hegseth earlier refused to answer a lawmaker's questions on how much a deployment of active duty U.S. Marines to Los Angeles will cost. After the activist joined a flotilla seeking to break Israel's blockade of Gaza and bring humanitarian aid to Palestinians, the U.S. president described Thunberg as a ''young, angry person.'' He said she should go to ''anger management class.'' Thunberg was detained then deported by Israel on Tuesday and sent to Paris. Asked upon arrival about Trump's comments, she replied in a matter-of-fact tone: “I think the world needs a lot more young angry women to be honest. Gen. Eric Smith testified at a budget hearing before senators that those Marines are trained for crowd control and they would have shields and batons as their equipment. When asked by Sen. Richard Blumental, a Connecticut Democrat, about the danger Marines would use lethal force that could result in injuries and deaths, Smith said he had faith in them. I have great faith in my Marines and their junior leaders and their more senior leaders to execute the lawful tasks that they are given.” The attack in early June that destroyed a large number of Russian bomber aircraft caught the U.S. off guard and represented significant advances in drone warfare, Hegseth told lawmakers Tuesday. Hegseth said the Pentagon “is learning everyday from Ukraine,” and focused on how to better defend its own military airfields. In a back an forth with the defense appropriations subcommittee's top Democrat, Hegseth refused to answer basic questions on the cost of deploying Marines to Los Angeles, instead falling back on political talking points. In a series of questions on the news that Marines would be sent to Los Angeles, House Appropriations defense subcommittee ranking member Rep. Betty McCollum told Hegseth “this is a deeply unfair position to put our Marines in,” she said. “There's no need for the Marines to be deployed.” McCollum took back her time and Hegseth was instructed by the committee chairman to provide the costs in writing instead. “It's a deliberate attempt by Trump to incite unrest, test the limits of executive power and distract from the lawlessness of his administration,” said Rep. Jimmy Gomez, who organized a news conference at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday morning. Rep. Nancy Pelosi contrasted Trump's actions now with his handling of the Jan. 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol when law enforcement officers were being beaten. Based on his opening remarks in his first appearance before lawmakers since taking office, there's been nothing but smooth sailing in the defense chief's office. Trump's defense chief faced a litany of questions on what some lawmakers called “rash” or “reckless” decisions or actions dating back to his first day in office, as Tuesday's hearing before the House Appropriations defense subcommittee began. Citing “a substantial rise in trade barriers'' but without mentioning Trump by name, the 189-country lender predicted that the U.S. economy — the world's largest — would grow half as fast (1.4%) this year as it did in 2024 (2.8%). The bank also lopped 0.4 percentage points off its forecast for global growth this year. He wrote on his social media site that people want to rebuild, and that the federal permitting process is “virtually complete on these houses.” Call your incompetent Governor and Mayor, the Federal permitting is DONE!! He's expected to field sharp questions from members of Congress about his tumultuous start as Pentagon chief, including his sharing of sensitive military details over a Signal chat, in three separate Capitol Hill hearings beginning Tuesday. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth meets with Polish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz at the Pentagon, Tuesday, May 27, 2025 in Washington. Lawmakers also have made it clear they're unhappy that Hegseth hasn't provided details on the administration's first proposed defense budget, which Trump has said would total $1 trillion, a significant increase over the current spending level of more than $800 billion. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks during a press conference about Utah's new fluoride ban, food additives and SNAP funds legislation, Monday, April 7, 2025, in Salt Lake City. Kennedy on Monday removed every member of a scientific committee that advises the CDC on how to use vaccines and pledged to replace them with his own picks. Major physicians and public health groups criticized the move to oust all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Kennedy, who was one of the nation's leading anti-vaccine activists before becoming the nation's top health official, has not said who he would appoint to the panel, but said it would convene in just two weeks in Atlanta. Although it's typically not viewed as a partisan board, the entire current roster of committee members were Biden appointees. The fulfillment of that pledge is now on full display in Los Angeles. But now, he's moving swiftly to test the bounds of his executive authority in order to deliver on his promise of mass deportations. What remains to be seen is whether Americans will stand by him once it's operationalized nationwide. ▶ Read more about Trump's efforts to fulfill his immigration promises Fort Bragg, located near Fayetteville, North Carolina, serves as headquarters for U.S. Army Special Operations Command.

Trump has promoted the Army's anniversary as a reason to hold a military parade in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, which is also his 79th birthday. Trump, who sees the military as a critical tool for domestic goals, has used the recent protests in Los Angeles as an opportunity to deploy the National Guard and U.S. Marines to quell disturbances that began as protests over immigration raids.</p>

President Donald Trump warned rioters in Los Angeles that his administration is "not playing around" as U.S. Marines prepare to deploy to the city Tuesday. Trump made the statement during an exchange with reporters, adding that he had called California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday and criticized his handling of the riots. "If we didn't send out the National Guard and us night, we gave him a little additional help. Los Angeles would be not a lot different than what you saw take place in California, in Los Angeles just a little while ago," he added, referring to this year's wildfires. Trump went on to describe the rioters as "animals," and argued they are paid agitators rather than real protesters. And we ended it, and we have in custody some very bad people, some very bad people." Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was brutally mocked by critics over a "delusional" X post describing the anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles as "peaceful demonstrations" while pinning blame on President Donald Trump for sowing "chaos" in southern California. This is what Hillary Clinton calls 'peaceful demonstrations,'" popular conservative X account Libs of TikTok posted, referring to how comments on Clinton's post were restricted to only permit ones from accounts Clinton follows on the social media platform and accompanied by footage of the destruction in LA. "California Governor Newsom didn't request the National Guard be deployed to his state following peaceful demonstrations. Trump sent them anyway," Clinton posted on X. "It's the first time in 60 years a president has made that choice. Trump's goal isn't to keep Californians safe. California Republican Liberty Caucus chair John Dennis posted in response to Clinton. Social media users were able to respond to Clinton through quote engagements, but not through direct replies as of Tuesday morning. "These are not peaceful Hillary," Florida Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna posted to X. "A public figure and a fraud like herself shouldn't be able to lock her replies, @elonmusk," one person responded on X, tagging X owner Elon Musk. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth doubled down on the decision to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles on Tuesday. "In Los Angeles, we believe that ICE, which is a federal law enforcement agency, has the right to safely conduct operations in any state, in any jurisdiction in the country, especially after 21 million illegals have crossed our border under the previous administration. Ice ought be able to do its job, whether it's Minneapolis or Los Angeles," Hegseth told lawmakers. Hegseth's comments came as House Speaker Mike Johnson addressed reporters alongside Republican leadership at the Capitol. Gavin Newsom, saying he needs to do his job. He is he's a a participant in accomplice and our federal law enforcement agents being not just disrespected but assaulted. Stop working on your rebranding and be a governor," Johnson said. FIRST ON FOX: California GOP Congressman Darrell Issa is calling for an investigation into allegations that the Los Angeles Police Department did not promptly respond to protect ICE officers being assaulted as violence broke out in the city on Friday night. Issa, who represents California's 48th Congressional District and is a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a press release Tuesday he is calling for a "full and complete Congressional investigation" into the response time of the LAPD assisting the ICE officers who, according to a press release from DHS, waited for two hours for assistance. "Last night, over 1,000 rioters surrounded a federal law enforcement building and assaulted ICE law enforcement officers, slashed tires, defaced buildings, and taxpayer funded property," DHS said in a press release on Saturday, referring to the previous night when violence broke out in Los Angeles in response to the ICE raids. "It took the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) 2 hours to respond." LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell, who quickly put out a press release Friday reassuring the public that the department does not participate in immigration activities, pushed back against DHS' claim in a Sunday press conference. "When we heard that, I think anybody who's a police officer couldn't believe it, and certainly anyone with LAPD couldn't imagine how that could happen," McDonnell said to reporters. McDonnell claimed that the actual response time was 40 minutes due to traffic. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., spoke out against the "anarchy and true chaos" in Los Angeles, declaring that Democrats forfeit "moral high ground" if they do not decry the violence. "I unapologetically stand for free speech, peaceful demonstrations, and immigration—but this is not that. My party loses the moral high ground when we refuse to condemn setting cars on fire, destroying buildings, and assaulting law enforcement," Fetterman declared in a post on X. Elon Musk replied to Fetterman's post with an American flag emoji. Deputy White House chief of staff and Cabinet secretary Taylor Budowich responded to Fetterman in a post, writing: "This is a wake up call for many Democrats: there is no room for you in the party of @GavinNewsom and @KamalaHarris. Their self-obsessed pursuits of power are blind to you and your concerns. They defend chaos, reject biology, and are unbothered by the invasion of our nation." Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has spoken out against violence, declaring in a post on X, "Dr. King defeated racist government officials & ended segregation through disciplined non-violent resistance. Defeating Trumpism, oligarchy & authoritarianism requires that same level of discipline. Violent protests are counterproductive and play right into Trump's playbook." "We made a great decision in sending the National Guard to deal with the violent, instigated riots in California. If we had not done so, Los Angeles would have been completely obliterated," the president asserted on Monday in a Truth Social post. MSNBC reporter Jacob Soboroff described illegal immigrants as the "fabric" of Los Angeles as anti-ICE protests and riots entered their fourth day on Monday. Soboroff spoke outside a Home Depot store in the city, which he described as one of the locations where U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested several suspects during a raid. "The big picture is Los Angeles is a so-called majority-minority city in a majority-minority state," Soboroff said. Soboroff condemned the arrests as "family separation in the interior," adding that "mass deportation is family separation." It's a different form of family separation, and it's exactly the intent of this administration," Soboroff said. Fox News' Lindsay Kornick contributed to this report President Donald Trump argued that Los Angeles would be "burning to the ground" if he hadn't ordered National Guard troops to intervene against anti-ICE riots in recent days. Trump made the statement from his personal Truth Social account on Tuesday morning, going on to attack California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass for their handling of recent wildfires. "If I didn't 'SEND IN THE TROOPS' to Los Angeles the last three nights, that once beautiful and great City would be burning to the ground right now, much like 25,000 houses burned to the ground in L.A. do to an incompetent Governor and Mayor - Incidentally, the much more difficult, time consuming, and stringent FEDERAL PERMITTING PROCESS is virtually complete on these houses, while the easy and simple City and State Permits are disastrously bungled up and WAY BEHIND SCHEDULE! Call your incompetent Governor and Mayor, the Federal permitting is DONE!!!" The anti-ICE protests continued in California's largest city throughout Monday night and into Tuesday, when U.S. Marines sent by President Donald Trump are expected to deploy. Media outlets and elected Democrats have made the rounds in recent days, often using the word "peaceful" to describe the anti-ICE unrest in Los Angeles over the weekend despite rioting and violence that has resulted in destruction and injured police officers, a video review by Fox News Digital finds. "The vast majority of protesters and demonstrators are peaceful," Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., said recently on MSNBC. "A lot of these peaceful protests are being generated because the president of the United States is sowing chaos," Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said on Sunday's "Meet the Press" on NBC. On CNN, a California Democrat House member said she doesn't know what the "so-called" violence is "all about." This is not city-wide civil unrest like has happened in our city before. But if you watch the pictures, especially on national TV, you would think that the entire city has blown up into unrest, and this is just not true." ABC7 Los Angeles anchor Jory Rand cautioned law enforcement from escalating tensions by interfering and said on Sunday that they risked turning "what is just a bunch of people having fun watching cars burn into a massive confrontation and altercation between officers and demonstrators." Rep. Nanette Barragán, a Democrat who represents California's 44th Congressional District, said on CNN's "State of the Union" program Sunday, "We are having an administration that's targeting peaceful protests." The Department of Homeland Security is sharing information about more than a dozen illegal immigrant suspects accused of crimes in the United States who were arrested in Los Angeles starting on June 6. The agency released the suspect information after violence broke out in Downtown LA over the weekend in response to the ICE raids that resulted in "hundreds of illegal aliens [being] arrested by ICE officers and agents," including "many with a criminal history and criminal convictions." DHS listed more information about 19 suspects that ICE Los Angeles arrested on June 7 who are accused of crimes ranging from robbery to second-degree murder to rape. "America's brave ICE officers are removing the worst of the worst from LA's streets, while LA's leaders are working tirelessly against them," DHS said in a Sunday statement as riots continued through the weekend. Sheriff Chad Bianco of Riverside County said agitators "are not protesting" and criticized Democrat Gov. "They are trying to violently influence something by political action. That is everything that the Constitution stands against," said Bianco, a Republican who is running for governor. "That is what law enforcement stands against, and that is what will facilitate the downfall of our civilized society. A civilized society has an adherence to the rule of law, and there is consequence for breaking that social compact. "Governor Newsom needs to put his phone down, go sit in his house behind the comfort of his TV screen and a couch, and be quiet because he is doing nothing but fueling this process," the sheriff said. He knows absolutely nothing about the enforcement of law. Protestors block the intersection of 2nd St. and San Pedro St. during Monday night's anti-ICE rally in downtown Los Angeles.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the National Guard and Marine deployments in Los Angeles to quell rioters in a heated exchange with Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., on Tuesday during a House Appropriations Subcommittee hearing. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday forcefully defended the deployment of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles, accusing California Gov. Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass of failing to protect ICE agents and citizens from violent rioters — and asserting that Trump is stepping in to do the job. Hegseth sparred with Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., during a heated House Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on Tuesday, asserting that the president had the legal authority to deploy the troops since rioters had attacked ICE agents and torched property in parts of the sanctuary city – while waving Mexican flags and flags of other nations. "The governor of California has failed to protect his people, along with the mayor of Los Angeles and so President Trump has said he will protect our agents and our Guard and Marines are proud to do it." Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth testifies before the House Committee on Appropriations subcommittee oversight hearing on the Department of Defense, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, June 10, 2025. The riots broke out on Friday as ICE agents were taking part in deportation raids in the city, fulfilling a key part of Trump's immigration enforcement agenda. "They're being attacked for doing their job, which is deporting illegal criminals that should happen in any city, Minneapolis or Los Angeles," Hegseth said. Aguilar questioned whether Trump had the authority to deploy National Guard troops under 10 U.S. Code 12406, citing three examples of when it can be used while also blasting the administration for not consulting with the state before doing so. Trump has deployed 2,000 National Guardsmen and around 700 U.S. Marines. A rioter holds up a Mexican flag as burning cars line the street on June 8, 2025, in Los Angeles, California. "Which authority is triggered here to justify the use?" But Hegseth fired back and said, "it sounds like all three to me." You and I both know that President Trump has all the authority necessary, and thankfully, he's willing to do it on behalf of the citizens of Los Angeles, on behalf of our ICE agents and behalf of our country." Aguilar also raised concern that the troops were ill-prepared, since pictures were posted of them sleeping on floors in uniform. "That's a disingenuous attack that misrepresents how much we care about our troops… Nobody cares more about the troops at the top than this secretary and the chairman in our department," Hegseth said. There are moments where you make do as best you can temporarily, but we are ensuring they're housed, fed, [and have] water capabilities in real time from my office." Rep. Pete Aguilar questions U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth during a hearing at the U.S. Capitol on June 10, 2025, in Washington, D.C.  (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense Bryn MacDonnell testified that the cost of the deployment is expected to be $134 million, with funds being pulled from regular operational accounts. Elsewhere, Hegseth said the department would need $961.6 billion in the fiscal year 2026 budget, which would be used to rebuild military strength, countering China, border security and funding the new Golden Dome missile defense system. A 10.5% pay raise was also secured for junior enlisted troops. You can send tips to michael.dorgan@fox.com and follow him on Twitter @M_Dorgan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• On the ground: Demonstrators and police faced off in scattered protests in downtown Los Angeles for a fourth day Monday, with officers using “less lethal” weapons to disperse protesters after objects were thrown at them. Damage appears to be limited to a portion of downtown, while much of the city has not been affected by the protests. • More troops: About 700 Marines have been activated to help protect federal personnel and property. President Donald Trump is defending his decision to mobilize another 2,000 National Guard members — a doubling of his initial deployment of those troops. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass have slammed his actions. President Donald Trump warned today that any potential protesters at Saturday's military parade will be met with force. And I haven't even heard about a protest,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “This is people that hate our country, but they will be met with very heavy force.” You might be speaking a combination of both,” Trump continued. … When there's no danger, they'll leave,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. Trump authorized the deployment of 2,000 National Guard members on Saturday night amid intensifying protests. On Monday, he doubled that number to 4,000, and 700 Marines were mobilized – all moves the state's Democratic leaders publicly opposed. You'd reporting on a lot of death and a lot of destruction that's not going to take place,” Trump said Tuesday. Trump also made clear that his team's aggressive immigration enforcement efforts will continue, including in other parts of the country. President Donald Trump again hedged on whether he will invoke the Insurrection Act to escalate military intervention in Los Angeles. “If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it, we'll see. But I can tell you last night was terrible, the night before that was terrible,” Trump told reporters today during an impromptu Oval Office appearance. Pressed specifically on how he will determine “insurrection,” Trump said, “Well, you take a look at what's happening.” They get money,” Trump said, repeating a claim made without evidence by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem yesterday. While Trump and his allies have repeatedly hinted they could invoke the Insurrection Act, CNN reported yesterday that administration lawyers have been working to craft a much less confrontational way of protecting the federal government's ability to carry out immigration enforcement, hoping to avoid further inflaming the situation, according to multiple people briefed on the discussions. Lawmakers are weighing in on the protests in downtown Los Angeles, with some defending President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and mobilization of the National Guard and Marines without Gov. The mobilization of US Marines and National Guard troops to respond to protests in Los Angeles will cost the Defense Department roughly $134 million, a top Pentagon official told Congress today. When asked by Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar where that funding is coming from, MacDonnell responded it was coming from “other (Operation and Maintenance) accounts.” MacDonnell was testifying today before the subcommittee alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine. “ANYONE who vandalized Downtown or looted stores does not care about our immigrant communities,” the mayor said in a post on X. Violence and vandalism is unacceptable.No one should be put in danger – not law enforcement, not protestors,” a note from the mayor's office said, adding that Bass continues to urge everyone to be peaceful. Bass is scheduled to give a situation update at 10:30 a.m. PT today. Smith testified at a budget hearing before senators that those Marines are trained for crowd control, and they would have shields and batons as their equipment. When asked by Sen. Richard Blumental, a Connecticut Democrat, about the danger that Marines would use lethal force that could result in injuries and deaths, Smith said he had faith in them. I have great faith in my Marines and their junior leaders and their more senior leaders to execute the lawful tasks that they are given.” Residents of downtown LA, where a small portion of the area has been impacted by anti-ICE protests, have told CNN how they feel about the Marines being activated, with one word coming up frequently – excessive. Michael Marshall said he believed it was a “waste of money,” and described President Donald Trump's actions as “fearmongering, it's just causing havoc.” Another resident, Juan Robledo, said he felt “It seems pretty excessive to deal with civilians that way.” For Priscilla Martinez, a Mexican American, the protests “hit close to home.” “I believe that people have the right to protest. I feel like everything that's going on, we need to protect our people. The protesters in my opinion haven't done anything to me. If anything, I just feel like there's a lot of terror that's happening to them.” One member of the team said he thinks crowds will come out tonight and he fully expects to have to do it all again Wednesday morning. Fresh graffiti can be seen for several blocks all over buildings, sidewalks, overpasses, and signs. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was pressed to provide answers on how the National Guard and Marine mobilization to Los Angeles was being funded during today's House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense hearing. “Where in your limited budget, sir, are you going to find in the remainder of this fiscal year, are you going to pull the money to cover these deployments, what holes are being created?” On the heels of anti-ICE protests in downtown Los Angeles, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California is concerned about the safety of friends and family who are demonstrating, along with the immigrants who were taken into ICE custody with no access to legal representation, its director told CNN's Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown. Eva Bitran, the director of immigrants' rights at the ACLU of Southern California, said most of what she's seen is “people really worried about their immigrant friends and families, their loved ones and their neighbors,” adding “everyone has a right to engage in First Amendment-protected conduct.” “It's important to recognize that people are heartbroken and really, really angry because ICE is kidnapping beloved members of our community and our families, and protest is an outlet for this righteous anger,” she added. As for the detainees in ICE custody, Bitran said she spoke with an immigrant who was detained last week from Monday to late Thursday in a federal building, inside a “completely overcrowded” room with metal benches, no hot food, no access to menstrual products and no access to water — only small juice boxes. Both moves underscore Trump's willingness to reshape how a president utilizes the military. And both reflect actions the president attempted to take during his first term, only to be talked down by military leaders at the time. Trump has said the troop activation is necessary to protect federal property and personnel, though has offered mixed messages on why the additional deployments are necessary. On Tuesday at Fort Bragg, the nation's largest military installation, Trump will watch a demonstration and deliver remarks focused on the Army's birthday. Gavin Newsom's wishes — amid anti-ICE protests in a new post on Truth Social. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass criticized the government yesterday for sending troops, saying the city was being used as a “test case” for taking away power from local government. Remember: The protests are largely concentrated to a portion of downtown LA, with much of the city continuing to function as normal. “Anarchists” are exploiting ongoing anti-ICE protests, Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said Tuesday. “Anarchists” and opportunists are “taking advantage of a situation that unfortunately continues to escalate,” Barger told CNN's Sara Sidner. Barger's concern is not about the peaceful protesters, but about “those that are embedded that are really attacking law enforcement,” she said. “But then, of course, we have looting taking place downtown, Barger said. When asked if President Donald Trump's decision to call in the National Guard and Marines has heightened tensions, Barger said, “No. It's important to communicate both at the state and federal level.” California Democratic Rep. John Garamendi told CNN that President Donald Trump's response to the protests in downtown Los Angeles is “about Trump pretending that he is the king of this nation, that he has the ultimate power and authority to do anything he wants to do.” Garamendi said the “very significant blowback” created by recent immigration raids and Trump's actions were to be expected. They've created fear all across this country,” he said. They cannot be throwing rocks and bottles at the police. While some buildings have been vandalized, and there is graffiti in downtown, much of Los Angeles has not been affected by the protests, she said. But she noted that what set this protest apart from others is the level of vandalism. CNN's Sara Sidner is also reporting live from Los Angeles, where she said that the damage was “not a sliver just of Los Angeles, it's really a sliver of downtown. On Saturday night, Hegseth posted on X that “the@DeptofDefense is mobilizing the National Guard IMMEDIATELY to support federal law enforcement in Los Angeles. And, if violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized – they are on high alert.” That comment raised eyebrows both at the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security, where officials wondered why Marines would need to be deployed in addition to National Guard troops and what their tasks would be. Lawmakers will likely have similar questions about how the troops have been trained, what their mission is in LA, and what their instructions are for the use of force. Lawmakers will also have their first chance to question Hegseth under oath about his role in Signalgate, in which he and other national security officials discussed detailed military plans in a text chain that inadvertently included a prominent journalist. Read more about his hearings over the next week here. Protests against immigration enforcement action are popping up around the country. Separately, labor leaders in various locations have called for the release of David Huerta, an influential union leader who was detained in the LA protests and later released on bond. The demonstrations for his release took place in cities including: Police have used a variety of tools to disperse crowds and quell protests that had devolved into violence in Los Angeles. That does not mean they are harmless: After the 2020 protests in response to the police killing of George Floyd, researchers found many people suffered injuries from less lethal weapons – particularly rubber bullets. Authorities have used several tools that a 2025 report by the non-partisan Congressional Research Service noted for their ability to incapacitate using blunt force. Flash-bangs devices – thrown either by hand or with a launcher – use an “explosive propellant to emit a bright flash of light … and ear-piercing sound,” the CRS report says.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As federal authorities stage immigration raids across Los Angeles, local police and officials say they are being kept in the dark — a lack of communication the city's leaders blame for hurting their response to escalating protests. While California has sanctuary laws that limit police from directly helping immigration enforcement, former federal officials tell CNN there's no prohibition against Immigration and Customs Enforcement sharing basic details about raids with police or government officials. “We do not know where and when the next raids will be. That is the concern,” L.A. Mayor Karen Bass said on CNN Monday. “You've really got to make sure that your state and local partners know when you are doing a large operation just to avoid any potential issues or confusion,” said John Sandweg, a former acting director of ICE during the Obama administration. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to multiple requests for comment before publication, but after this story published, a DHS spokesperson disputed Los Angeles city leaders' claims. In response to Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell's statement that “LAPD was not given advance notice that the federal operations would occur in that area” of Friday's immigration enforcement, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement, “FALSE. McDonnell on Tuesday, asked about McLaughlin's statement, stood by his earlier comments. “Per Chief McDonnell, the Department was not notified,” an LAPD spokesperson told CNN. Bass also reiterated that point on Tuesday afternoon when asked by reporters about whether federal authorities communicated with police or other local authorities. “I was notified when the raids were happening,” she said. The US attorney for California's Central District suggested in an interview on Sunday that sanctuary policies were to blame for keeping L.A. law enforcement at arm's length. “We understand that they are not going to help us in immigration enforcement. We did not seek their assistance for any immigration-related operations,” Bill Essayli told NBC Los Angeles. ICE generally decides whether to share advance warning of raids on a case-by-case basis, said Kieran Donahue, president of the National Sheriffs' Association. “In most areas, local agencies work collaboratively with ICE, receiving advance notice of enforcement actions and sometimes even providing support to help ensure public safety,” said Donahue, who is sheriff in Canyon County, Idaho. Donahue added, “However, in sanctuary jurisdictions like Los Angeles, ICE may refrain from notifying local officials in advance due to concerns that those officials may obstruct or interfere with federal operations.” Some of the key law enforcement and government agencies in Los Angeles confirmed that they did not receive warnings from ICE about its recent raids, including one on Friday targeting apparel makers in L.A.'s Fashion District. LAPD's response was delayed because of an inability to plan for appropriate staffing and equipment, the agency said. By the time the department received a call for help, hundreds of demonstrators had gathered and federal agents had already deployed irritants — creating what an LAPD press release called a “hazardous environment” for officers. In a statement Saturday, ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said the LAPD took more than two hours to respond to multiple calls for assistance with the unrest. That lack of advance warning was echoed by Bass and Paramount Mayor Peggy Lemons. Kenneth Gray, a former FBI agent who now teaches criminal justice at the University of New Haven, told CNN that ICE normally gives local law enforcement a heads up in case there is a call for assistance. But he said ICE does not have to inform local authorities about such plans, and in cities and states with constraints on cooperation with ICE, Gray said it isn't surprising if they aren't told in advance. “Their concern, of course, is operational security in that there may be people being informed about ICE activity and be able to avoid being detained,” he said. The Trump administration's hardline approach to immigration has repeatedly put it at odds with California, a state that has positioned itself as a national leader in protecting undocumented immigrants. Barring a few exceptions, the law prohibits local law enforcement agencies from “using money or personnel to investigate, interrogate, detain, detect or arrest persons for immigration enforcement purposes.” As Trump has staged an increasingly aggressive push to arrest and deport undocumented immigrants, ICE has raided workplaces and homes across the country. Under some of the agreements, local officers identify inmates in their jails without legal immigration status and coordinate with ICE to begin the deportation process. Other partnerships allow police officers or sheriff's deputies to question and arrest undocumented immigrants in their communities during routine policing activities. California is one of 10 states without any current agreements between ICE and local or state law enforcement, according to the data. That hasn't been the case in L.A. this month, according to some local police and city officials who say they have only learned of raids when they're called in to quell conflicts. That's what happened in Paramount on Saturday, the mayor told CNN. Lemons said there was no communication with federal agents as they staged at a Home Depot. Police only scrambled to action when they learned of growing altercations between protestors and ICE agents. Some experts said California police face a difficult tension between maintaining the trust of undocumented residents and also coming to the aid of federal authorities in trouble. “For the police chief of Los Angeles, he has two constituencies. “On the other hand, he has a responsibility to support another federal agency, because if those federal agents are overpowered, if they can't maintain order, then you have a public safety issue where either those agents can get hurt or community members can get hurt.” This story has been updated with a statement from DHS.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump has expanded presidential power to ban broad groups of immigrants. President Donald Trump can't stop using — and abusing — his legal authority to block the entry of noncitizens into the country. When he issued a travel ban on citizens of Muslim-majority countries early in his first term, he did so by invoking Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows him to block any foreigner if he deems that their entry would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States.” When he issued a proclamation turning away noncitizens who could not demonstrate the ability to pay for their health care costs, he cited Section 212(f). When he halted most legal immigration at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, first from China and then from other countries, there was Section 212(f) again. Finally, last week, he announced that he would block foreign students from receiving student visas to attend Harvard University and implement a travel ban on 12 countries, as well as restrictions on seven others. The travel ban took effect on Monday, just after midnight, and the legal framework for both orders was built on Section 212(f). Some of Trump's attempts to invoke Section 212(f) have been challenged in court. Judges struck down several versions of Trump's first-term travel ban before the third iteration was ultimately upheld by the US Supreme Court (after it was expanded to include non-Muslim-majority countries). Former President Joe Biden rescinded the travel ban, as well as the Covid-19 and health care-related bans, when he took office, refusing to defend them in legal challenges. The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis. Most recently, a federal judge in Massachusetts also blocked Trump's order on Harvard students, and as of Monday, the State Department had returned to processing international student visas. However, in testing the limits of 212(f) through these policies, Trump has succeeded in getting the Supreme Court to affirm his broad powers to ban foreign nationals under immigration law, marking a key expansion of executive authority. The law has become a key tool to keep people out as Trump tries to implement his restrictive vision of US immigration policy. Before Trump, both Democratic and Republican presidents used the 212(f) authority sparingly. Former President Barack Obama, for instance, used the authority to block Russian officials from entering the US following their country's 2014 invasion of Crimea. Former President Bill Clinton used it to impose restrictions on Nigerian military officials who impeded the country's transition to democracy by annulling the country's 1993 elections. Trump's conceptualization of 212(f), however, is markedly different. He has used the authority to block broad swaths of noncitizens from a variety of countries, not just their government officials or people involved in criminal activity. He has not spared US visa or green card holders in some cases, including those affected by his first travel ban. The Supreme Court's 2018 decision narrowly upholding Trump's first travel ban made that shift clear. That evidence included Trump's 2015 campaign statements calling for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” which lower-court judges pointed to in blocking earlier versions of the travel ban in 2017. According to Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired immigration law professor at Cornell Law School, “court challenges to this travel ban are likely, but they may fail.” However, Yale-Loehr said, “even if this expansion is legal, it is not good policy. We are not necessarily safer by banning immigrants from these countries.” All of that might help Trump's case if the policy is challenged in court. Unlike a blanket ban on immigrants from the affected countries, it is tailored to withstand legal scrutiny by targeting only would-be immigrants who are currently not in the US. They are asking for a legislative fix to stop Trump from implementing policies that will affect both US citizens who might be separated from their families and citizens of foreign countries hoping to enter the US, though such a measure would almost certainly have to wait on unified Democratic control of government. If passed, President Donald Trump's signature legislation would make college more expensive. Tuskegee University's president explains how he's approaching this Trump administration.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the news about identifying the suspect during an interview on Monday night with Fox News host Sean Hannity. “Bill Essayli, our incredible U.S. attorney out there, working with ATF, DEA, and the FBI, have been doing a remarkable job. That guy has just been identified, and they are doing a search warrant on his house as we speak.” “He is going to be on the ‘Most Wanted' list.” Video of the suspect throwing cinder blocks at ICE SUVs urgently driving down a Southern California road went viral on social media over the weekend. Many of the rocks shattered windshields upon contact. Others cheered on as he kept hitting the cars and causing damage. “I strongly suggest you turn yourself in, it's only a matter of time,” Bongino warned in the post. Bondi echoed Bongino's sentiments and warnings after identifying Reyes on Hannity's show. Thousands of rioters caused chaos and destruction over the weekend, protesting the illegal immigration enforcement operations that ICE carried out. Rioters vandalized buildings, set police cars and Waymo vehicles on fire, and assaulted law enforcement officials during the demonstrations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gavin Newsom doesn't like President Donald Trump activating the National Guard in his state. His solution should be to do a better job of making sure Democratic Party officials do not impede federal deportation operations. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents served warrants at several worksites across Los Angeles last Friday after a judge found probable cause that employers were using fictitious documents for illegal workers. Instead of working with federal law enforcement agencies conducting lawful arrests, Mayor Karen Bass issued a statement accusing the agents of sowing “terror.” She additionally promised to work with “immigrant rights community organizations” to coordinate a response, warning, “We will not stand for this.” Later, David Huerta, who is president of the Service Employees International Union of California, was arrested at a worksite for obstructing federal officers. On Saturday, California State Assemblyman Jose Luis Solache saw several Customs and Border Protection vehicles leave the freeway and enter his neighborhood. The agents stayed in their cars and did not arrest anyone. Vamonos pa fuera (let's go, get out of here).” The incitement worked, and CBP agents found themselves surrounded by hundreds of rioters who threw rocks at them. Finally, sheriff deputies arrived and fired tear gas and flash-bang rounds to clear a path for CBP agents to escape the mob. Stores were looted — a sure sign that the rioters are not on the side of the angels — cars were set on fire, and fireworks were launched at police and their vehicles. Newsom wants to blame Trump for the violence, but his allegations do not bear scrutiny. “We didn't have a problem until Trump got involved,” Newsom falsely tweeted Sunday night. But Trump did not announce activation of the National Guard until midnight on Saturday, at which time Los Angeles had been engulfed in rioting for two days. They are the ones telling constituents not to tolerate federal law enforcement in their communities. Democrats and their open border allies are allowed to protest Trump's policies peacefully. If Democratic politicians want to stand with illegal immigrants and wave the Mexican flag, they are at liberty to do so, dumb though it would be politically. But they have no right to obstruct federal law enforcement as officers serve warrants and lawfully arrest illegal immigrants for deportation. These are the same Democrats who refuse to enforce the state laws against illegal camping, drug dealing, burglary, shoplifting, and arson. Only 300 National Guard soldiers have been deployed to protect three federal locations in Los Angeles. If Newsom and Bass want to prevent more troops from coming, they should stop obstructing ICE's work.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CNN's chief data reporter said a sharp rise in public approval for President Donald Trump's immigration policies emboldened his decision to send 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles amid violent protests over immigration enforcement. During a Monday segment on CNN News Central, data analyst Harry Enten explained that Trump's net approval on immigration has experienced a dramatic shift since his first term — it has moved from negative 21% in 2017 to plus-1% today, according to aggregate polling. “This is Trump's net approval rating on immigration,” Enten told host John Berman. “It's gone up like a rocket now versus eight years ago during Trump's first term.” Enten said the public's support for Trump's immigration strategy, especially among voters in areas directly affected by border policy and federal enforcement operations, is giving the president confidence to act decisively, even if it triggers clashes with Democratic state leaders. These numbers mark a significant uptick from similar polling during Trump's first presidency. Enten cited an Ipsos poll that found Republicans enjoy a 19-point advantage over Democrats on the issue of immigration. “Americans believe that Democrats just don't have a clue on immigration,” Enten said, noting the GOP's credibility on the issue has grown substantially since 2024. Trump deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles over the weekend after ICE agents arrested numerous illegal immigrants, many of them with serious criminal records, including assault with a deadly weapon, grand theft, and attempted rape. In response, Trump authorized the deployment of 2,000 National Guard members — a move Gov.</p>
