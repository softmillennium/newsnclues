                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Starbucks plans to roll out a generative artificial intelligence assistant created with Microsoft Azure's OpenAI platform to 35 locations this month as part of its strategy to simplify baristas' jobs and speed up service in its cafes. The coffee chain showed off the new technology to more than 14,000 North American store managers at its Leadership Experience in Las Vegas on Tuesday. The three-day event comes as Starbucks pushes to revive its sluggish U.S. sales and "get back to Starbucks," as CEO Brian Niccol has described the effort since he took the role last year. Niccol's priorities include slashing service times to four minutes per order. Quick, accurate answers to barista questions could help achieve that goal. "It's just another example of how innovation technology is coming into service of our partners and making sure that we're doing all we can to simplify the operations, make their jobs just a little bit easier, maybe a little bit more fun, so that they can do what they do best," Starbucks Chief Technology Officer Deb Hall Lefevre told CNBC. Baristas can either type or verbally ask their queries in conversational language. As the AI assistant evolves, Starbucks has even bigger plans for its next generation. Starbucks is expanding its relationship with Microsoft about a year after the tech giant's CEO Satya Nadella stepped down from Starbucks' board of directors. Since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022, companies have been trying to implement generative AI in their own operations, envisioning the AI hype can cut expenses and maybe even boost their stock prices. Walmart and JPMorgan Chase are among the corporate giants that have rolled out AI assistants for their workforce. But chatbots aren't always a perfect solution. They can sometimes provide inaccurate answers, known as "hallucinations," which could mean another headache instead of an easy resolution. Other restaurant companies have also been looking to AI to simplify their restaurant workers' jobs and improve operations. For example, Yum Brands has partnered with Nvidia to roll out AI order-taking, Nvidia-powered computer vision and restaurant performance assessments fueled by AI. But AI agreements haven't always been successful. Other new technology on display at the Leadership Experience includes the latest generation of Starbucks' Mastrena espresso machines and a more intuitive point-of-sale system. Plus, the technology can offer personalized recommendations and loyal customers' repeat orders, helping Starbucks achieve the personalized touch it's looking to bring back to its cafes.

Strategy's Michael Saylor dismissed short-seller Jim Chanos's recommendation to short the shares of the Bitcoin treasury company and buy the cryptocurrency because of the large premium the company's common stock commands over the value of its token holdings. 

“I don't think he understands what our business model is,” Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy, said during a Bloomberg TV interview on Tuesday. “We're actually the largest issuer of Bitcoin-backed credit instruments in the world.”   </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The undocumented Mexican immigrant who was detained after being framed by a jailed inmate for threatening President Donald Trump can be released on a $7,500 bond, a Chicago Immigration Court judge ruled Tuesday morning. Judge Carla Espinoza said at a hearing that she does not believe Milwaukee resident Ramon Morales-Reyes is a danger to the community pending removal proceedings. The judge noted that although the 54-year-old Morales-Reyes has been arrested several times since 1996, he has only been convicted once, for disorderly conduct. An attorney representing the Department of Homeland Security did not oppose a request by the immigrant's lawyer, Cain Oulahan, requesting bond. Espinoza said that if Morales-Reyes is unable to post bond, the next hearing in the case will be on July 10, and that she would set another date if the married dad of three is released. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in a statement, said, "While this criminal illegal alien is no longer under investigation for threats against the President, he is in the country illegally with previous arrests for felony hit and run, criminal damage to property, and disorderly conduct with domestic abuse." DHS will continue to fight for the arrest, detention, and removal of illegal aliens who have no right to be in this country," McLaughlin said. Morales-Reyes, who has lived in the United States since 1986, was arrested May 22 on suspicion that he had written three letters to law enforcement officers in Wisconsin that threatened Trump and others. A week later, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem touted Morales-Reyes' arrest in a news release that called the dishwasher an "illegal alien," and featured his photo, as well as an image of a handwritten letter threatening to shoot "your precious president" Trump. But Milwaukee police who questioned Morales-Reyes quickly realized there was a problem with the allegations against him, court records show. Also, Morales-Reyes does not speak, read, or write English fluently, while the writing in the letters was in English. When a police detective asked Morales-Reyes, "Who would want to get [him] in trouble, [he] stated that the only person who would want to get him in [trouble] was the person who had robbed him and who law enforcement knows to be the defendant, Demetric D. Scott, who is detained in Milwaukee County Jail, was arrested in late 2023 for allegedly robbing Morales-Reyes and attacking him with a box cutter. Scott, 52, told police in late May that he had written the threatening letters about Trump, and put Morales-Reyes' address on the envelopes before they were sent on his behalf by others, to get the immigrant arrested by federal authorities so that he would be unable to testify at Scott's criminal trial in July, court records state. Scott hoped that his case would be dismissed when Morales-Reyes failed to appear in court, those records say. Scott has been charged with identity theft, felony intimidation of a witness, and bail jumping in connection with the letters plot. At the time Morales-Reyes was arrested, he had applied for a special type of visa available to victims of certain crimes. At the bottom of that page is a "disclaimer," which notes that he is no longer under investigation for threatening Trump. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>IBM on Tuesday announced a roadmap to develop a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer called Quantum Starling. Part of the company's plan involves the new IBM Quantum Nighthawk processor, which is set to release later this year, according to a blog post announcing the details. "More than that, it will require a device capable of correcting errors and preventing them from spreading throughout the system. ... it will require a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The quantum race accelerated this year after Google announced its breakthrough quantum chip "Willow" in December. Microsoft rolled out its first quantum chip Majorana 1 in February, and Amazon followed a week later with its "Ocelot" chip. Quantum computing has received more attention and investment in recent years as experts say they are getting closer to a device that can actually solve problems faster than a traditional computer based on semiconductors. Researchers say a working quantum computer will be a useful tool to simulate complicated physics or do math that could decipher encrypted data. Quantum Starling will be built at the IBM Poughkeepsie Lab in New York. IBM's new roadmap sets a timeline for building the components needed in the build, with a series of processors and adapters all named with the bird theme. The Quantum Cockatoo adapter is set for 2027. IBM said Nighthawk can run quantum circuits with 5,000 gates, like the Heron, but plans to boost it to 15,000 gates by 2028. — CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report. We want to hear from you.

India and the US will expedite trade talks to conclude an agreement that includes “early wins” for both sides, an official said, as the two nations race to clinch a deal before Washington's tit-for-tat tariffs kick in next month. 

Trade officials from India and the US met in New Delhi for about a week to discuss issues including greater market access, digital trade, customs rules and technical barriers to trade, the official told reporters in New Delhi, asking not to be identified as the information isn't public. The US trade team arrived in New Delhi last week to advance trade negotiations.   </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The World Bank sharply cut its global economic growth projections Tuesday, citing disruption from trade uncertainty in particular. It now expects the global economy to expand by 2.3% in 2025, down from an earlier forecast of 2.7%. "International discord — about trade, in particular — has upended many of the policy certainties that helped shrink extreme poverty and expand prosperity after the end of World War II," Indermit Gill, senior vice president and chief economist of The World Bank Group, said in the report. It also cut its 2025 growth forecast for the U.S. by 0.9 percentage points to 1.4%, and reduced its euro area GDP expectations by 0.3 percentage points to 0.7%. The Bank noted that an escalation of trade tensions could push growth even lower, but the picture could improve if major economies strike lasting trade agreements. "Our analysis suggests that if today's trade disputes were resolved with agreements that halve tariffs relative to their levels in late May, 2025, global growth could be stronger by about 0.2 percentage point on average over the course of 2025 and 2026," Gill said. The U.S. and many of its trading partners are currently in negotiations after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on numerous countries in April. This week, for example, the U.S. and China are meeting in London after the two countries agreed to temporarily reduce levies following talks in May. Negotiations are also still ongoing between the U.S. and European Union with less than a month to go before previously announced tariffs are set to come into full force. In cutting its global growth expectation, the World Bank follows various other bodies, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which also cited the fallout from trade and tariff-related uncertainty as the key factor. The OECD said earlier this month that it was expecting global growth to slow to 2.9% in 2025, also caveating its forecast with the potential for future tariff developments. It had previously forecast global growth of 3.1% this year. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Samuel Tombs, Chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, sees a labor market struggling with softening hiring and an accelerating trend of downward revisions. In May, 139,000 jobs were added, beating the 125,000 consensus estimate, but that was overshadowed somewhat by sharp revisions to prior months' data. March's initial figure of 224,000 payrolls added has since been nearly slashed in half, down to 120,000. It's likely that May's figure is inflated, too, Tombs said. "We expect May's number to be revised down to about 100,000 by the third estimate, published in early August," Tombs wrote in a recent note. Since January 2023, downward revisions between the intial and third estimates for each month have averaged 30,000. The frequency of downward revisions could be due to reporting by small businesses filing payroll data late, Tombs said. Smaller companies are often hit the hardest by high interest rates and tariff costs. Tombs sees continued weakness in the retail, wholesale, and transport and logistics sectors, and expects employment in those parts of the economy to fall by 50,000 by year-end due to a reduction in the "pull-forward effect" from tariffs, which saw many businesses and consumers rush to spend money ahead of tariff-related price hikes. On top of the revisions, hiring also appeared poised to slow. The NFIB small business hiring intentions index slipped to its lowest level since May 2020, and regional Fed surveys suggest continued declines in service-sector employment outside healthcare and education. Tombs believes government jobs will also continue to decline after their DOGE gutting as federal employees who accepted a voluntary buyout get removed from the payroll in September — they've fallen by 59,000 this year, including by 22,000 in May. On this trajectory, Tombs expects the unemployment rate to peak at 4.8% by December. This year, the Fed has been in wait-and-see mode when it comes to cutting rates, and some strategists believe it's prioritizing bringing inflation down before turning to expansionary monetary policy.</p>

War in Ukraine:

Russia is stepping up drone production to increase massive daily attacks on Ukrainian cities as Moscow pressures Kyiv to concede to peace terms.

The Kremlin unleashed deadly destruction in the capital Kyiv and the Black Sea city of Odesa overnight, firing 315 drones and seven missiles, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. That followed a barrage of a record 479 drones the previous night, which itself surpassed the high set on June 1.</p>

A model F-35 fighter jet at the Lockheed Martin booth at the Canadian Association of Defence & Security Industries (CANSEC) trade show in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, on Wednesday, May 28, 2025. 

Canada's purchase of 88 Lockheed Martin Corp. F-35 fighter jets will cost far more than projected, and the country faces a potential shortage of qualified pilots to fly them, a government audit has found.

The overall cost estimate of the order has jumped to C$27.7 billion ($20.2 billion), almost 50% more than originally anticipated, Canadian Auditor General Karen Hogan said in a report. There will be at least C$5.5 billion in additional costs for infrastructure upgrades and advanced weapons, she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At a location in Farmington, New Mexico, the white bedspreads are meant to show dirt at a glance. Hampton has become the largest US chain, and a global export, by being rigorously OK. The waffle makers are standing by. Shortly before 6 a.m., early risers stalk the cafeteria at the Hampton Inn & Suites in El Segundo, California, waiting for the breakfast buffet to open. At the appointed hour, proteins and starches spin out in combinations that change slightly but perceptibly from day to day. On a Tuesday in March, it's egg white frittatas, Yukon gold potatoes and maple sausage; the next day, it's scrambled eggs, red potatoes and chicken sausage. There are yogurts and hand fruit scattered about for the truly health-conscious, and a drawer of bite-size lemon scones for those who are merely playing at it. In a now-familiar ritual, guests push a plastic tab to extrude the mix into a paper cup, drizzle it over a waffle iron, then flip the handle and watch the seconds tick down on a digital timer. As with almost everything at Hampton, the process has been rigorously engineered. Those little paper cups of batter are what peak hotel performance looks like.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>London's famous black cabs could be about to get some robotaxi competition. Uber and Wayve, a British AI startup backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, announced on Tuesday that they will trial fully driverless autonomous vehicles in London, as the ride-hailing giant steps up its robotaxi ambitions. The driverless ride-hailing service in the UK capital will see Uber deploy vehicles running Wayve's AI-powered self-driving tech in a pilot program. It's one of the hardest proving grounds," Wayve CEO Alex Kendall told Business Insider during a test drive ahead of the launch. Uber inked its deal with Wayve last year, agreeing to deploy self-driving vehicles powered by the British startup's technology on its platform in multiple markets around the world. Uber also invested in Wayve through an extension of the company's Series C fundraising round, which raised $1.05 billion from investors including Softbank, Nvidia, and Microsoft. The London-based startup, which has been testing its fleet of autonomous Ford Mach-Es with a safety driver in London for several years, has quickly become one of the buzziest names in the robotaxi industry. Wayve says its "AI driver" runs on an end-to-end AI model — an approach also adopted by Tesla — allowing it to react to the physical world in the same way a human would and drive anywhere, unlike rivals like Waymo, which rely on high-definition maps to operate their robotaxis. "It's a real demonstration of how well this technology generalizes. The diversity we saw on these roads is immense, from winding roads in the Swiss Alps and dirt tracks in Italy to diverse cities like Vancouver and Tokyo," said Kendall. He said the vehicles in the robotaxi service in London will initially use a mixed suite of sensors, including cameras, radar, and lidar (laser-based sensors), adding that the chaotic nature of London's roads made it the perfect place to trial Wayve's technology without a safety driver. During BI's test ride, Wayve's AI driver navigated a number of obstacles, such as roadworks in London's busy Kings Cross district. And I think only through end-to-end machine learning can you reach that level of scale," he added. Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.</p>
