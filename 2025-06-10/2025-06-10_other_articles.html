                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Eastern Kentucky Ghost Squad recently brought its investigation team to Pikeville, focusing on local history and reported paranormal activity at sites including a museum and the courthouse. Bobbie Wright, lead investigator and founder of the Eastern Kentucky Ghost Squad, is clear about the group's mission. “We don't just focus on the paranormal,” she said. The squad includes Wright's husband Ray Wright, Freddie Lewis, Tonya Easterling and her husband Michael Carter Easterling and Jeremy Phipps, all from Morgan County. The group recently brought its equipment and curiosity to Pikeville, a location Wright said she had researched for some time. “I've been looking for places in Pikeville for a while, because it's not very far from home and there's a rich history in Pikeville,” she said. “We just wanted to learn more about it,” she said, explaining that her search often starts online. I'll go through all types of videos, YouTubes.” That' is how she found a video featuring Brandon Kirk, who currently manages the Big Sandy Heritage Center museum. We emailed back and forth for a while and then it finally worked out to where we could go,” Wright said. “We went just to talk to Brandon, and he showed us the museum and the courthouse,” Wright said. The visit took a turn when they began using their Spirit Talker device. “At the time, we didn't pay attention to it. She continued, “I went back through my pictures from the museum, and sure as the world, Henry was relevant. It was Elijah Henry Hall, the last man who was supposedly legally hanged in Pikeville for murdering his brother.” Returning that night with the full crew, Wright said, “We had rim pods, millimeters, K2s, cat balls and tripwire. “When he was telling us the history, I started feeling something,” Wright said. “So I started turning on the equipment. And from get-go, we started having stuff happen. The group uses Spirit Talker apps, which Wright explained as “a word generator and the spirits can use those apps to speak to us.” Beyond investigating, Wright said she also makes promotional videos for the locations they visit. “I do free promo videos for the places that we go to, to help more people find out about these places and hopefully visit and show support,” she said. The group has investigated various locations, preferring sites that haven't been widely explored. The places we like haven't been explored before. We want to share different stories that haven't been heard,” Wright said. Asked about skeptics, Wright said, “A lot of people are scared of this stuff, so they try to explain it away. That fear makes people want to ignore it.” She added, “But when people come with us and see what happens, they usually leave as believers. The spirits especially like to mess with skeptics.” Wright said her group never charges for house calls. And on our investigations, we like to take people with us. If someone wants to go with us, we usually try to.” Wright said. Wright emphasized that the work is as much about history and healing as it is about the unexplained. “The paranormal is not something to be afraid of. It's just our past that's wanting to finish the story,” she said. There's a lot more to be discovered in Pikeville with the paranormal,” Wright said. For information about investigations or to join the group on a visit, Wright encourages people to contact her. “Check out our YouTube at Eastern Ky. Ghost Squad, like and subscribe,” she said. Or the group can be reached directly by phone at (606) 359-4765. Their next investigation will take place in Prestonsburg at the Samuel May House, set up by Sam Hatcher. “We try to show people the other side and show them it's not always something to be afraid of,” Wright said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Before May, most people in Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s so-called Make America Healthy Again movement likely weren't familiar with Leland Lehrman, a self-styled media entrepreneur, anti-vaccine activist, and former teahouse owner who once unsuccessfully ran for the US Senate in New Mexico. Lehrman claimed Israel is “a leading candidate for architect of the 9/11 attacks.” Last month, however, Lehrman was named executive director of the MAHA Institute, a new advocacy organization that aims to amplify “MAHA wins for President Trump, Secretary Kennedy, and the Cabinet,” advise elected officials on the movement's agenda, and “find and attract” allies to work in government. The group shares key leaders with MAHA PAC, the new name of American Values 2024, a fundraising vehicle that raised $50 million in support of Kennedy's presidential candidacy. But even less well-known is Lehrman's long history of promoting antisemitic and extreme conspiracy theories, as detailed in a new report from the Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights, an organization which studies extremism and the far right. Lehrman wrote multiple articles outlining his belief in the Protocols on the website of Jeff Rense, a far-right radio host who's often given airtime to Nazis, racists, and assorted antisemites. In 2005, Lehrman sat down for a long interview with Rense in which he described “high-level Jewish Illuminists, or Lucifer worshipers” who have “most certainly collaborated with the Lucifer worshipers in all the other sects like Nazism, like high-level Freemasonry. They have most certainly collaborated in the development of this New World Order plan.” His father, the investment banker Lewis E. Lehrman, is from a Jewish family, although he publicly converted to Catholicism four decades ago. In his first piece for Rense's site in 2005, Lehrman described himself as “an American citizen of Jewish heritage concerned about the methods and doctrines that the criminal leadership of the Jewish and Zionist hierarchy have promoted worldwide.” Lehrman acknowledged receiving a request for comment from Mother Jones, but he did not answer questions about his past writings and statements before publication. Lehrman has claimed “high-level Jewish…Lucifer worshipers”  helped  develop a “New World Order plan.” When asked about Lehrman's past statements, Lyons replied with a brief statement. “We're being asked to comment on an accusation of anti-semitism,” he wrote. HHS did not respond to requests for comment, but on his LinkedIn page, Lehrman details a series of roles that have drawn him nearer to Kennedy and his inner circle. For the last eight months, according to his LinkedIn, he's worked as a volunteer and then as a consultant for MAHA Action, a separate group led until recently by anti-vaccine activist Del Bigtree, the former communications director of RFK's 2024 campaign. “I assisted Stefanie Spear, Chief of Staff to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. I engaged with Bobby's policy correspondence… I worked with the team to advance both MAHA policies and our candidates for government positions,” Lehrman wrote. In Lehrman's first article on Rense's site, he argued that the Protocols were legitimate—a notion debunked not long after they first appeared around 1903. Lehrman also promoted 9/11 conspiracy theories, writing that during Dennis Kucinich's 2004 Democratic presidential campaign—which Lehrman said he “ran” in Santa Fe—he “met a former Captain in US Army Intelligence who was able to substantially add to my understanding of the 9/11 Inside Job. Very substantially.” He also baselessly tied the assault to Israel, writing in July 2005 for a defunct site called Progressive Convergence that Mossad, the country's intelligence service, was “a leading candidate for architect of the 9/11 attacks.” During his unsuccessful attempt to become New Mexico Democrats' 2008 Senate nominee, Lehrman made reopening a commission on September 11 a major priority, as he continued to promote conspiracy theories about the attacks, now claiming that then-vice president Dick Cheney was responsible. “It's only because Americans are so terrified and so easily propagandized that this unbelievably bad conspiracy theory that the government has put forward about 19 hijackers and the guy in a cave in Afghanistan even warrants mention,” he told the Santa Fe Reporter in December 2007. After leaving New Mexico, Lehrman settled with his family in upstate New York, where he participated in anti-vaccine activism before, with the emergence of Covid, becoming intensely suspicious of lockdown measures and vaccines that target the virus. In his Substack bio, Lehrman presents himself as having decided to stay out of politics and writing until, as he put it in a nod to Orwell, “the COVERT-1984 Plandemonium started,” and he “knew it was time to begin again in earnest.” In April, he attended a conference hosted by the Brownstone Institute, which was founded to promote anti-Covid lockdown ideas. In an interview during the event, he hailed the 1955 book Pawns in the Game by Canadian antisemite and conspiracy theorist William Guy Carr as “a very, very controversial book, but it's also an important one,” praising it for how it “uncovered the thread of Free Masonic activity.” According to extremist researcher Chip Berlet, Carr claimed “an age-old Jewish Illuminati banking conspiracy used radio-transmitted mind control on behalf of Lucifer to construct a one world government.” So far, the MAHA Institute has done little public-facing work besides its May 15 launch event, which was meant to preview the MAHA Commission Report, a Trump administration document which turned out to cite nonexistent studies. The speakers that day included Calley Means, a special government employee and Kennedy advisor who previously worked on his presidential campaign, and Sara Brenner, an FDA official who recently served as the agency's acting commissioner. Lyons' statement gave no indication that Lehrman's writings and claims will affect his standing at the MAHA Institute, but antisemitism has not been a barrier to serving within the Trump administration itself. And while Kennedy's HHS is part of a joint federal task force which claims to investigate antisemitism in universities, Kennedy himself once claimed that COVID was a bioweapon designed to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, and multiple Trump cabinet members have ties to antisemitic and far-right extremists.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Premiering in 2005, Supernatural ran for an impressive 15 seasons, developing a passionate fan base along the way. As many know, the show centers on brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) Winchester as they travel across the country "saving people and hunting things." But what begins as a cross-country monster hunt soon turns into a battle to save the world, as Sam and Dean face off against demons and angels alike. Almost immediately after Supernatural's divisive series finale, speculation began on whether the show would ever return. Before long, Jensen Ackles announced that he and his wife, Daneel Ackles, were working on a Supernatural prequel following a young Mary Campbell (Meg Donnelly) and John Winchester (Drake Rodger). During this time, Dean began exploring the multiverse, searching for a version of his family that got a happy ending. The Winchesters finale recontextualizes the entire season, turning it into more of an epilogue for Dean than a prequel to Supernatural. Unfortunately, this revelation came too late, as many viewers had already given up on The Winchesters by the time of its finale. Despite assurances from Jensen Ackles and the show's creators that The Winchesters would not contradict Supernatural canon, it seemed to confirm fans' worst fears. This reveal would have established from the beginning how the show fit within Supernatural's established canon and would have given viewers more reasons to watch. Dean's death in Supernatural's finale left many fans unhappy, and it would have been in The Winchesters' best interest to advertise immediately that this was a continuation of Dean's story. Meanwhile, the story of Mary and John Winchester had already been explored in Supernatural and was not something most fans had asked for. It also would have been fun to see Dean pop up throughout the season, maybe narrating the differences between this universe and what he knew of his real parents. I enjoyed The Winchesters more in hindsight after watching the finale, but I understand why some Supernatural fans bailed before they made it that far. Alternate universe stories can undoubtedly be fun, but The Winchesters took way too long to reveal that this was the kind of story it was telling. I enjoyed The Winchesters more in hindsight after watching the finale, but I understand why some Supernatural fans bailed before they made it that far. Ultimately, The Winchesters would have been much more interesting if it had been clearly set up as an alternate universe series depicting a version of John and Mary Winchester who got a happy ending. The Winchesters is a prequel series to Supernatural created by Eric Kripke. It follows monster hunters John Winchester (Drake Rodger) and Mary Campbell (Meg Donnelly) as they search for their missing parents in the years before the birth of their sons Sam and Dean. The Winchesters is narrated by Jensen Ackles, who serves as the show's executive producer, and also stars Tom Welling as Samuel Campbell. Supernatural is a television series that follows brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, who were raised by their father to hunt and combat supernatural entities after losing their mother to a demonic force. Traversing the American landscape in their '67 Chevy Impala, they face numerous paranormal threats. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Many of the best TV shows are sci-fi or fantasy epics like Ridley Scott's 2 season masterpiece - so their premature endings hurt all the more. EXCLUSIVE: ScreenRant presents a first look at the trailer for the new Western thriller Long Shadows, starring Dermot Mulroney and Jacqueline Bisset. The season finale of MobLand saw one war end for the Harrigan crime family, but Harry's refusal of Kat McAllister may soon kick off another. Ballerina clearly teases a sequel in its final moments, but it may be a while before the spinoff actually gets its anticipated second installment. Resident Alien season 4 achieved a big milestone on Rotten Tomatoes, and it may be a good sign for the future of Alan Tudyk's sci-fi comedy series. Ncuti Gatwa's Doctor Who exit brought back a familiar face to the TARDIS, but didn't explain how and why Billie Piper returned to the show.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A bombshell US Government report has shone new light on Area 51 conspiracy theories after decades of UFO sightings. Believers have long claimed that extra-terrestrial life is being hidden at the high-security base in Nevada, with fantastical stories of alien autopsies and secret otherworldly technology fuelled by repeated sightings of unexplained flying objects. Now, a new review from a US Department of Defense taskforce has revealed that both the Pentagon and the Justice Department deliberately fuelled UFO conspiracy theories - including those about Area 51 - to conceal Cold War-era military projects, such as stealth fighter jets. This included visiting a nearby bar and handing owner fake photos of flying saucers, sparking a new frenzy of rumours about the base. Sean Kirkpatrick, a former head of Pentagon's UFO office who now heads the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) taskforce, trawled through decades of military reports on unidentified aerial phenomena for the new report. He found that on several occasions, alien conspiracy theories were planted by the Pentagon themselves. This included a bogus alien-hunting squad, known as 'Yankee Blue', which recruited serving members of the Air Force through a hazing ritual. Candidates for the project were shown pictures of flying saucers and told they would be helping to 'reverse-engineering alien aircraft' while being sworn to secrecy. Servicemen involved in the programme would only find out it was fake decades later when it was officially declassified in 2023. Mr Kirkpatrick's review also evaluated one famous incident from 1967 involving former US Air Force captain Robert Salas, who described seeing a 'UFO' disable ten nuclear missiles at a base in Utah. Mr Salas said he was ordered to stay silent about the incident. But the report found that the technical issues likely resulted from a secret electromagnetic pulse (EMP) test used to gauge the base's resilience to interference, which Mr Salas and his colleagues had not been told about. Some parts of the AARO's first public report were withheld last year at the request of the US Air Force, with a full follow-up containing all redacted details expected to be released later this year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(NewsNation) — Legendary UFO journalist George Knapp believes it will take a whistleblower with tangible evidence to uncover what the Pentagon and other agencies have hidden from the American people for several decades. Knapp told “Cuomo” he does not believe those who harbor secrets about the realities of UFOs are “going to give this up.” “We created the story about Area 51, we created this story about nukes being disabled. All the technology that people have been seeing in the skies around the world, on every culture, every continent throughout human history, that's us,” Knapp said sarcastically. Knapp also believes there are often more pressing news items and current affairs than UFOs, and as such, “people who tell these lies get away with it.” Chris Cuomo said a shift will occur in the desire from both sides of the political aisle to uncover more about UFOs once they realize it can be a worthwhile political tool. “One of these two poison parties is going to realize there's something in this issue for them versus the other one, and they'll go all-in down that road,” Cuomo said. “And these cats are all about advantage, never about advancement of anything but their own aims.” Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amid bizarre rumors about the re-engineering of alien spacecraft and sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) over the ‘secretive' Area 51, an explosive Pentagon report released recently claims that UFO sightings were just conspiracy theories planted and amplified by it as a cover-up for classified military programs. In July 2022, the Pentagon established the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to investigate Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) across air, sea, and space. As part of their study, the investigators, led by Sean Kirkpatrick, the first director of the AARO, reviewed government documents dating back to 1945 and interrogated current and former military officers. “A tiny Pentagon office had spent months investigating conspiracy theories about secret Washington UFO programs when it uncovered a shocking truth: At least one of those theories had been fueled by the Pentagon itself,” the WSJ report stated. According to the investigation, these disinformation efforts were aimed at concealing the testing of military equipment from people who had unintentionally witnessed classified military tests. The Pentagon disseminated disinformation, including photoshopped images of flying saucers. It is still unclear to investigators if these activities were centralised military programs or local efforts. Thus, creating a frenzy over UFO sightings in the region. The new findings are significant because ‘Area 51,' which is a part of the Nevada Test and Training Range, has been a lightning rod for UFO speculation for decades. For years, analysts believed that many of these UFO sightings were likely just classified military programs. In 2013, for instance, the CIA declassified documents confirming Area 51's role in testing U-2 spy planes, SR-71 Blackbirds, and other advanced aircraft, explaining some UFO sightings as misidentified military projects. However, doubts over military cover-ups have been around for only a while. For instance, retired Air Force Captain Robert Salas saw a UFO fly down over a nuclear missile test site in Montana in 1967. However, he was told never to discuss it with anyone. Kirkpatrick's team found that Salas was never informed that what he observed was a test of an emerging electromagnetic pulse to determine whether American silos could withstand the radiation of atomic weapons and respond in retaliation should the Soviet Union launch an initial attack. If this deception was not enough, the Pentagon also involved officers and commanders to lend its lies more credibility. The WSJ report notes,  ”For decades, certain new commanders of the Air Force's most classified programs, as part of their induction briefings, would be handed a piece of paper with a photo of what looked like a flying saucer.” Many of these commanders were told they were part of a program called “Yankee Blue,” which was designed to reverse-engineer extra-terrestrial technology. The unsuspecting officers bought this and signed non-disclosure agreements to keep it confidential. AARO released an extensive report (hailed as historic) in March 2024, stating that there was no evidence that the US officials had encountered aliens. It noted that tests of sophisticated US spy planes and space technologies in the 1950s and 1960s led to a surge in UFO encounters. There was “no evidence” that the US government had come across extraterrestrial life, the investigators wrote, adding that the majority of UFO sightings were ordinary objects from Earth. “The proliferation of television programmes, books, movies, and the vast amount of internet and social media content centred on UAP-related topics most likely has influenced the public conversation on this topic, and reinforced these beliefs within some sections of the population,” it noted. The investigators emphasised that there is a “particularly persistent narrative” that the government has retrieved spacecraft and extraterrestrial remains while plotting to conceal its alien research endeavors. The report noted that officials have not found any evidence of extraterrestrial visitors despite approaching the claim with an open mind, thus addressing previous claims made by former US intelligence officer, David Grusch. In June 2023, Grusch alleged that the US government has operated a “multi-decade” program to recover and reverse-engineer crashed UAPs of “non-human origin,” including intact and partially intact vehicles, under a program named “Immaculate Constellation.” Presenting the report, AARO stated that there are still 50 to 100 UAP sightings every month, highlighting ongoing conjecture regarding official cover-ups. “The department is committed to releasing a second volume of its Historical Record Report, to include AARO's findings on reports of potential pranks and inauthentic materials,” the DOD said in a statement. However, it casts doubt over previous reports of sightings, in which several US officers have admitted to experiencing multiple UAPs in their careers. For example, a former US Navy pilot, Ryan Graves, who formerly piloted an F/A-18, told Fox News about an incident where two aircraft from his squadron flew side by side, and one of these unidentified objects flew directly between them. For now, more details and transparency from the Pentagon are awaited.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mohammad Eslami, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), made the comments in a televised interview on Tuesday, addressing remarks made by Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). He said by passing the remarks, Grossi had clearly shown “his [true] character,” and proven to be among those that have been waging psyops against Iran for long. Eslami was referring to Grossi's interview with i24NEWS, an Israeli TV channel, in which the latter had said the Israeli regime could not “destroy” Iran's nuclear facilities with “a single surgical strike. The Iranian nuclear chief said Grossi had issued the remarks, despite lacking all jurisdiction to comment on such issues. Eslami noted that the international law and precautions that concerned such matters essentially robbed the IAEA director general of any entitlement to intervene in affairs of such nature. Grossi had also said, “Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon at this moment,” but claimed that “it has the material” to make one, echoing the Israeli regime's and its Western allies' unfounded allegations about, what the accusing sides have described as, Iran's so-called “diversion” towards obtaining nuclear arms or its intention to develop one. Tehran, itself, has also categorically ruled out the prospect of either pursuing, obtaining, or maintaining nuclear arms in line with moral and religious guidelines. Grossi had, however, additionally, alleged that the Islamic Republic harbored a “determination” to develop such weapons, adding that likely Israeli military aggression against the country could “potentially have an amalgamating effect, solidifying Iran's determination.” He had also pointed to the Israeli regime's repeated threats to use military aggression against Iran's nuclear facilities, alleging that the threats meant that “the Iranian thing has incredible potential to become catastrophic." Eslami, however, denounced Grossi for resorting to “expressing concern for Israel,” a regime that, unlike Iran, was a possessor of nuclear arms, and a non-member of the IAEA's Safeguards Agreement that would not brook any oversight of its nuclear sites. Adding to his comments, the Iranian official regretted that the IAEA chief's remarks indicated that “international organizations [such as the UN nuclear agency] are a tool in the hands of dominant powers as well as being totally subject to Israeli influence.” Press TV's website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: Select the "Add to home screen" option</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disinformation spreading on social media platforms has stoked an already tense situation. Misleading photographs, videos and text have spread widely on social media as protests against immigrant raids have unfolded in Los Angeles, rehashing old conspiracy theories and expressing support for President Trump's actions. The flood of falsehoods online appeared intended to stoke outrage toward immigrants and political leaders, principally Democrats. They also added to the confusion over what exactly was happening on the streets, which was portrayed in digital and social media through starkly divergent ideological lenses. There were numerous scenes of protesters throwing rocks or other objects at law enforcement officers and setting cars ablaze, including a number of self-driving Waymo taxis. At the same time, false images spread to revive old conspiracies that the protests were a planned provocation, not a spontaneous response to the immigration raids. The confrontation escalated on Monday as new protests occurred and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced — on X — that he was mobilizing 700 Marines from a base near Los Angeles to guard federal buildings. The latest deployments prompted a new wave of misleading images to spread — some purporting to show Marines and the military service's weapons in action.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dropping via local tape label What You See Is What You Get with distro through Kill Yellow Fever Records, the six-track cassette continues their blend of old-school hardcore punk and d-beat with streaks of doom, post-hardcore, and grind. “We've gotten through some false starts and lineup changes but we feel the finished work sets out our most musically tight release yet,” the band states. “We tried to stay more to our roots on this of old-school hardcore punk and d-beat but threw in a touch of doom or a blasty section here and there.” From track one, PSYOP drops listeners into a reality shaped by surveillance, disinformation, and scorched-earth politics. On Last Season, the band conjures a world of droughts and dead oceans. Revolutionary Guard sees vocalist Danial K reckoning with his own Muslim upbringing while criticizing the role of fundamentalism—whether Islamic, Christian, or Zionist—in perpetuating violence and false promises. The EP's centerpiece is Psychological Operations, a track that PSYOP describes as their self-titled-in-spirit song. “We wanted to do our own spin on a self-titled song that captures the main vibe of PSYOP: how it feels to live in an imperialist surveillance state plagued by disinformation and propaganda.” Built collaboratively from a bass riff, the song piles on side-to-side parts, breakdowns, and gang vocals. “We grew up in a post-9/11 era of reduced civil liberties, drone strikes, and regime changes that set the stage for the current nightmare we find ourselves in.” PSYOP will play day two of Break Free Fest in Philly, followed by a DC release show on June 21st with Pilau and No Model—both of whom will also be dropping a split. “We'll be playing everything from guerrilla underpass shows to more traditional stages supporting great bands like HIRS Collective and Body Farm.” “We're big believers in the power of DIY to unite, spark joy, and speak out against the many injustices of those in power,” they say. In DC, a city they admit is “tough to make art in,” they namecheck a thriving scene made up of grindcore, screamo, youth crew, and hardcore bands holding their ground across basements, streets, and festivals.</p>
