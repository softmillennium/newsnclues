                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Compared to stool DNA testing, researchers found that CT colonography is a cost-saving and clinically effective method for colorectal cancer screening, according to a study was published today in Radiology, a journal of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death globally. Due to the disturbing trend of colorectal cancer diagnoses in younger patients, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and multiple medical societies have lowered the recommended age for colorectal cancer screening to 45 years of age. Dr. Pickhardt notes that optical colonoscopy is the preferred method of colorectal cancer screening due to its cancer prevention abilities in removing benign precancerous polyps during the procedure. However, less invasive and less expensive screening methods have become more accessible due to recent Medicare coverage expansions. Multitarget stool DNA (mt-sDNA), which analyzes stool samples for specific colorectal cancer biomarkers, and CT colonography, which uses CT scans to examine the colon and rectum for cancer or polyps, are both now covered procedures for Medicare recipients. According to Dr. Pickhardt, both stool DNA testing and CT colonography are less invasive and much safer primary screening options. The researchers used a Markov model to simulate the progression of colorectal disease in a model of 10,000 45-year-olds. The simulation period was divided into one-year intervals, and simulated individuals were assigned health states based on the presence or absence of colorectal lesions of varying sizes. While both screening methods were clinically effective compared to no screening, CT colonography demonstrated a higher reduction of colorectal cancer incidence of 70 to 75%, compared to the 59% reduction achieved by mt-sDNA. In this analysis, mt-sDNA screening was found to be cost-effective relative to no screening, with an estimated cost of nearly $9,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained (QALY), well below the selected threshold of $100,000. Since advanced polyps that are larger than 10 millimeters are the primary target of colorectal cancer prevention, the study demonstrated the potential success for a hybrid approach to cancer screening, with a three-year surveillance for small colorectal polyps via CT colonography and colonoscopy referral for large polyps. When the conventional CT colonography screening strategy of referring patients with detected polyps greater or equal to 6 mm in size for colonoscopy was compared with the hybrid strategy that included 3-year surveillance for small (6–9 mm) polyps, the former was not cost-effective relative to the latter strategy. This result was driven primarily by the higher costs related to colonoscopy referral for small polyps, which was not sufficiently offset by the corresponding small incremental gain in QALYs. A strategy consisting of 3-year surveillance for small colorectal polyps and colonoscopy referral for large polyps achieved the best overall balance. "Among the safe, minimally invasive colorectal cancer screening options, CT colonography is more effective at preventing and detecting cancer-and is also more cost-effective-than stool DNA testing," Dr. Pickhardt said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When it comes to treating strokes, time-to-intervention is most critical. About 1.9 million brain cells die on average for each minute that a large vessel stroke goes untreated. To improve recognition of the early warning signs of a stroke, NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island is conducting a quality study with healthcare providers in its Simulation Center in Mineola. "In our continuing effort to reduce the time when stroke patients first enter our hospital to when they are diagnosed and receive lifesaving treatments, we are utilizing our high-tech Simulation Center to create real-life scenarios to test how quickly responders can recognize the signs of a stroke and act," said Levi D. Dygert, MD, an NYU Langone vascular neurologist who is leading the initiative. "Medical residents and physician assistants are participating in this project, and to date, the results are quite promising." Patients who are diagnosed with large vessel occlusion strokes typically have two treatment options: receive an injection of clot-dissolving therapeutics, which can be used within the first 4.5 hours, or undergo a neurointerventional procedure to remove the clot by sucking it out through a puncture in the artery. The study also found that door-to-arterial puncture time was reduced by 10 minutes (11.9 percent) and door-to-clot removal engagement was reduced by 6.5 minutes (6.2 percent). "Simulation Center training is always helpful because every case can be different. You are able to get feedback from the medical team that is observing how you reacted to a particular scenario, as well as from actors who may play the roles of patients or their families," said Syeda Fatima, MD, a second-year neurology resident who participated in a training session involving a simulated stroke patient with a complex medical history and an actor playing the role of a family member. On average, every 40 seconds, someone in the U.S. has a stroke. The 5,000-square-foot Simulation Center provides valuable clinical training and education for physicians, nurses, residents, and medical students at NYU Grossman Long Island School of Medicine, as well as other health professionals and first responders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New study shows dopamine treatments and symptom asymmetry impact patients differently. A new study in Neurodegenerative Diseases looks closely at how Parkinson's disease can affect something as everyday and essential as recognizing emotion in someone's voice. Researchers from the University of Geneva and Rennes University Hospital studied how people with Parkinson's disease are able to recognize different emotions when hearing speech recordings. Participants were grouped based on whether their physical symptoms were more prominent on the left or right side of the body. The study included individuals in both early and advanced stages of the disease, with early-stage participants tested on and off dopaminergic replacement therapy (DRT). The authors wrote, "patients with a predominance of left-sided symptoms" had more difficulty recognizing vocal emotions than both healthy controls and patients with right-sided symptoms. The role of treatment also stood out. This suggests that the side of symptom onset may affect how DRT interacts with the brain's emotion-processing systems. As the authors put it, "These results bring to knowledge the differential effects of disease duration, DRT and motor symptom asymmetry on vocal emotion recognition in Parkinson's disease." "Based on converging results, they propose that asymmetry is a key feature of the disease and should be taken into account at all stages of Parkinson's, especially when evaluating current and future treatment strategies," says Professor Julie Péron, Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology Laboratory (CENLab), University of Geneva. "The team also emphasizes the importance of replication across independent studies to strengthen the reliability and generalizability of these findings, and to further advance personalized approaches to care." This research invites us to think beyond movement symptoms and consider how Parkinson's affects communication, connection, and emotional understanding.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has been awarded a $3.8 million grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a division of the National Institutes of Health, to study drug overdose cases linked to novel synthetic opioids. Front-line doctors urgently need better tools and information to manage overdose cases, especially involving synthetic drugs. Our study will give them real-time data and insights from across the country, so they can deliver faster, more accurate care. This work will help emergency providers identify what substances people have taken, how serious the situation is, and what treatments are most likely to save lives, especially in overdose cases involving unknown or newly emerging drugs." The country's opioid epidemic is expanding, with drug overdose deaths doubling from 2015 to 2023. For the first time ever, drug overdose deaths surpassed 108,000 in the United States in 2023, and more than 70 percent of these cases involved an opioid. Initially, most illicit opioid overdoses were linked to heroin, but the changing face of global drug commerce introduced synthetic opioid fentanyl analogues into the drug supply. Now, these drugs have far surpassed heroin as the primary cause of overdose deaths. These highly potent novel synthetic opioids, along with psychoactive adulterants, are now commonly detected in the illicit opioid supply within the United States, creating a toxic drug supply with new drugs that most clinicians have never heard of. As a result, when patients overdose on these novel drugs, it is challenging for physicians to identify them in their system or to find the most effective treatment. Naloxone, which rapidly reverses the effects of opioid overdose, is typically used in emergency rooms in these cases, but doctors have concerns that it may take more naloxone to reverse the effects of these new opioids, and new adulterants may not respond to naloxone. This new study aims to answer questions involving synthetic opioids. Toxicologists will use state-of-the-art technology to conduct molecular identification to confirm if novel fentanyl analogs, adulterants, and nitazenes - opioids that are more potent than fentanyl, and increasingly identified in the U.S. illicit opioid supply and undetectable by conventional fentanyl testing strips - are in their system. Researchers will also disseminate information regarding overdose outbreaks and trends to the public by partnering with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They will update study results onto the CDC's suspected opioid overdose dashboard. "We aim to predict the effects of emerging synthetic opioids and get ahead of regional outbreaks, delivering timely alerts to doctors, public health agencies, and the public," adds Dr. Manini.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethnic minority healthcare workers who are also born overseas face a double disadvantage due to the combined effects of ethnicity and migrant status, according to new research published in JRSM Open. Using data from the nationwide UK-REACH cohort study, this is the first analysis to explore how migration status - often overlooked in Human Resources records - intersects with ethnicity to affect NHS career progression. The cross-sectional study of over 5,700 healthcare workers employed under the NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) pay scale - which covers staff including nurses, midwives, and allied health professionals - found that overseas-born staff were significantly less likely to be placed in higher AfC pay bands, even after adjusting for education, job role, and years of professional qualification. In particular, Asian and Black healthcare workers born overseas were less likely to reach higher pay bands compared to their White UK-born and trained counterparts. Our findings highlight that migration status plays a critical role in shaping healthcare professionals' career prospects, yet this data is not routinely collected. These disparities cannot be addressed without first being recognised and recorded." Although ethnic minority and migrant healthcare workers make up nearly a quarter of the NHS workforce, they remain underrepresented in senior positions within the AfC framework. Migrant workers may face additional challenges distinct from non-migrant ethnic colleagues, including difficulties with international qualification recognition, limited professional networks, and restricted access to training. The absence of routinely collected migration status data means these issues are often overlooked in research, creating a gap that hinders efforts to address workforce inequality. "Ethnic minority healthcare workers represent over a third of staff at NHS pay band 5, but their presence drops sharply to just 10% in senior roles," said senior author Professor Manish Pareek. "This lack of diversity in leadership limits influence over key workplace decisions such as pay, scheduling, and policy, which may contribute to a less supportive environment for ethnic minority staff. These inequalities risk driving higher attrition rates amid the NHS's ongoing staffing challenges." The authors recommend that NHS workforce policies explicitly address the distinct barriers faced by migrant healthcare workers, including training access, credential recognition, and mentoring and leadership opportunities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>IVD is a key enzyme in leucine catabolism, catalyzing the conversion of isovaleryl-CoA to 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA. Defects in IVD function lead to toxic accumulation of metabolites such as isovaleric acid, resulting in isovaleric acidemia (IVA)-a life-threatening autosomal recessive disorder characterized by vomiting, metabolic acidosis, and neurological damage. Although IVD gene mutations are known to cause IVA, the enzyme's structural dynamics and complex substrate-binding mechanisms have long hindered precise mechanistic studies. By optimizing protein purification protocols, the team obtained cryo-EM structures of IVD in apo state and in complex with substrates (isovaleryl-CoA and butyryl-CoA) at high resolutions. The structures revealed that human IVD exists as a tetramer, with each monomer forming a unique "U-shaped" substrate channel composed of α-helical and β-sheet domains. This architecture enables selective recognition of short-branched chain substrates while excluding longer chains due to steric hindrance. Further analysis highlighted IVD's distinct substrate selectivity within the ACAD family of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Structural comparisons between IVD and ACADM revealed critical differences in their active pockets. In IVD, residues L127 and L290 form a narrowed side-chain distance (compared to T121 and V284 in ACADM), creating spatial constraints that exclude substrates longer than C7 via a "bottleneck effect". Conversely, ACADM's Y400 and E401 residues restrict lateral flexibility with bulky side chains, while IVD's G406 and A407 reduce steric hindrance, enabling accommodation of branched chains. Disease-associated mutations (e.g., A314V, E411K) disrupt FAD binding or distort the substrate pocket, reducing enzymatic activity by over 80%. For example, the E411K mutation replaces negatively charged glutamate with lysine, destabilizing FAD binding and tetramer integrity. These atomic-level insights clarify genotype-phenotype correlations, improving diagnostic accuracy and prognostic predictions. The resolved structures provide a foundation for developing small-molecule therapeutics targeting the FAD-binding region or substrate pocket to stabilize mutant IVD and restore partial function.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>IVD is a key enzyme in leucine catabolism, catalyzing the conversion of isovaleryl-CoA to 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA. Defects in IVD function lead to toxic accumulation of metabolites such as isovaleric acid, resulting in isovaleric acidemia (IVA)-a life-threatening autosomal recessive disorder characterized by vomiting, metabolic acidosis, and neurological damage. Although IVD gene mutations are known to cause IVA, the enzyme's structural dynamics and complex substrate-binding mechanisms have long hindered precise mechanistic studies. By optimizing protein purification protocols, the team obtained cryo-EM structures of IVD in apo state and in complex with substrates (isovaleryl-CoA and butyryl-CoA) at high resolutions. The structures revealed that human IVD exists as a tetramer, with each monomer forming a unique "U-shaped" substrate channel composed of α-helical and β-sheet domains. This architecture enables selective recognition of short-branched chain substrates while excluding longer chains due to steric hindrance. Further analysis highlighted IVD's distinct substrate selectivity within the ACAD family of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Structural comparisons between IVD and ACADM revealed critical differences in their active pockets. In IVD, residues L127 and L290 form a narrowed side-chain distance (compared to T121 and V284 in ACADM), creating spatial constraints that exclude substrates longer than C7 via a "bottleneck effect".

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CN Bio, a leading provider of Organ-on-a-chip (OOC) systems and solutions that accelerate drug discovery and development workflows, has introduced two new animal microphysiological system (MPS) models that enhance translatability in preclinical drug safety and toxicology assessments to its Contract Research Services (CRS). Building upon the Company's FDA-recognized drug induced liver injury (DILI) assay, the expanded offering enables rapid, comparative studies between commonly used animal and human models to flag interspecies differences early, and better informs in vivo study design. Traditional human in vitro methods have limited capacity to accurately determine drug toxicity. Added to this, the discrepancies between these methods and in vivo animal studies make it challenging to accurately predict safety risks for humans during preclinical testing. In response to growing market demand for tools that address these concerns, CN Bio has expanded the in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) capabilities of its established PhysioMimix® DILI assay, adding the ability to easily compare results across human-, rat-, and dog-derived Liver-on-a-chip models. These assays offer a modernized workflow to generate predictive and actionable insights that mitigate the risk of costly, late-stage conflicting data, and reduce unnecessary animal use by providing early warning of hepatotoxicity/DILI prior to in vivo studies. The assay enables a broad range of longitudinal and endpoint testing for DILI-specific biomarkers from single- or repeat-dosing studies over a 14-day experimental window. Understanding safety risks is critical to successful drug development, however, fundamental physiological and biological differences between species can lead to inaccuracies in predictions, often causing drug candidates to be wrongfully abandoned as toxic, or worse, mistakenly classified as safe." Dr Emily Richardson, Lead Scientist, Safety and Toxicology, CN Bio She added: "Having established our DILI assay as an industry leading option to garner more valuable insights across the development pipeline, we were in an ideal position to expand its capabilities and address this crucial gap in understanding hepatotoxicity using the most commonly used animal models. Partnering with us to utilize this powerful service not only ensures robust and reliable results but also provides access to a team of Organ-on-a-chip experts, who are invested in your success; to de-risk your pipeline and move it forward with confidence."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new review published in Genes & Diseases highlights the critical role of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, offering a powerful preclinical platform that more accurately mimics human tumors. These models could revolutionize drug development, improve treatment efficacy, and guide personalized therapies. PDX models are created by implanting patient-derived tumor tissue into immunodeficient mice, preserving essential features such as tumor genetics, microenvironment, and drug response patterns. Unlike traditional cancer models, which rely on cell lines, PDX models provide a more faithful representation of the complexity of human cancer, making them a superior tool for testing novel therapies before they reach clinical trials. A key advantage of PDX models is their ability to support co-clinical trials, where patients and their corresponding PDX models are treated in parallel. This approach allows researchers to evaluate treatment responses in real time, helping to identify the most effective therapies for individual patients. These models have already demonstrated significant promise in areas such as breast, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer research. Additionally, tumor evolution within PDX models may not always mirror the progression of cancer in human patients, posing limitations for long-term studies. To overcome these obstacles, scientists are actively working on next-generation PDX models, incorporating technologies such as CRISPR gene editing, organoid co-cultures, and humanized mouse models. These innovations aim to enhance the reliability and scalability of PDX systems, accelerating the development of breakthrough cancer therapies. With ongoing advancements in biobanking and artificial intelligence-driven drug discovery, PDX models are expected to become an indispensable tool in precision oncology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Regardless of how close your retirement horizon is, thinking about what you'd like to do (and not do) when you stop practicing medicine can help ensure a fulfilling retirement. The Medscape Physicians Eye Retirement 2023 Report found that An identity outside of medicine is critical for a happy retirement. “I noticed that as my peers were retiring, if their self-identity was almost exclusively as a health care provider — ‘I'm a physician and nothing else,' those people had a hard time,” Chuck Daris, MD, a former internist, rheumatologist, and chief medical officer in suburban Chicago who retired just before 2019, told Medscape Medical News. “Read up on Medicare, Social Security, and health insurance,” said Steve Green, MD, a family medicine practitioner in San Diego who retired in 2022. “You may be able to retire before you think…it's important to have an actual plan.” Doctors can get trapped in the “money accumulation” phase, he said. “It's a hard change to say, ‘I have enough money, and now all I have is time,'” he adds. You want to retire during the go-go years.” Green said he's never had any sense of regret about retirement because he is too busy with his numerous nonmedical interests, hobbies, and pursuits. “You need to cultivate a network of other people. You tend to lose the hospital people or clinical people as you retire,” warned Daris, whose hobby is landscape photography. The retired physician belongs to a camera club and has traveled with friends he met there to shoot photos in far-flung locales, including Chile, Patagonia, and Pakistan. Green has a network of friends through golf, swimming, and rowing. “Socializing and remaining connected is an important part of retirement,” said Daris. “Too many physicians don't have any network outside their medical network.” Befriending other doctors who have already retired as well as other retired friends is another good stepping stone to forming a retired friends circle. “About once a month, I go out to ambulatory clinics and surgical centers — I get out of the house, and I get to use my medical skills on my own terms,” said Daris. “I feel it's very important to give back and show gratitude,” said Hall. “Don't think that you're going to sit there in a rocking chair…I think about, how can I make people's lives better? Yet you also want to avoid overbooking yourself. “Don't overcommit to a schedule,” said Green. “I have some friends who are also retired who when I ask about golf, they literally have meetings all week for various things,” he added. “They still aren't letting themselves enjoy their free time. Building in free time and some flexibility is one of the joys of retiring so don't forget to schedule some. It's really nice to wake up and think, ‘I'll go on a bike ride now. Finally, plan ahead so you can consider retiring earlier rather than later, said Green. “In medicine, the culture is often to work until you can't stand up anymore. I think retirement shouldn't be just the absence of work — it should be something you look forward to and plan for. Kelly K.
