                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Filings with the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission showed only a few small contributions from individuals tied to crypto companies for various candidates. As voters head to the ballot boxes to cast their choices for candidates in the Democratic and Republican primaries in New Jersey's race for its next governor, funds from crypto traders and interest groups don't seem to be as much of a factor as they were in the 2024 federal races. According to filings with the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission reviewed by Cointelegraph as of Tuesday, no significant political action committees (PACs) funded by cryptocurrency companies or interest groups appeared to have contributed to any of the 12 Democratic and Republican candidates running for governor. In a search for contributions directly to candidates or PACs, only a few filings suggested any connections to the crypto industry. There was a $500 contribution to Democratic candidate Josh Gottheimer's campaign from mining company MARA Holdings' vice president of investor relations, Robert Samuels, and a $900 contribution to Republican candidate Jon Bramnick from Rohan Varkey, a strategic finance senior analyst at Block. In addition, a Coinbase consultant, Miti Sathe, donated $500 to Democratic candidate Steve Fulop, and Roshan Shah, co-founder and CEO of the New Jersey-based mining company Decimal Digital Currency, contributed $2,000 to Democratic candidate Ras Baraka. Fairshake and its affiliate Protect Progress used more than $450,000 to support Robert Menendez Jr. and Gottheimer in their respective Democratic primaries for US House of Representatives seats in 2024. Related: What role did crypto voters play in the 2024 US election? Gottheimer, Fulop and Republican candidate Bill Spadea expressed views that were supportive of digital assets at the event. According to a June 4 report from AdImpact, the gubernatorial primary was set to become the most expensive election in the state's history, with more than $85 million spent to support or oppose candidates. Data showed PACs and interest groups spent more than $22 million on Gottheimer's campaign, though the report did not mention funding from crypto companies.

On November 8, 2023, Midnight Hub went silent after co-founder Brian Veluz-Nepomuceno was arrested for fraud. The company had sold ROOMS and Digital Nomads NFTs with promises of staking, exclusive features, and future profit-sharing. None of these were delivered, and the NFTs lost nearly all their value.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As public blockchain data grows more visible and tracking tools get more advanced, many users now recognize the risks of using traditional wallets without safeguards. By merging zero-knowledge technology with the principles of cold storage, it delivers a secure wallet experience that remains active without revealing sensitive user data. Experts suggest its core focus on privacy could make 4,900% gains a realistic outcome post-launch. Many users believe managing their own keys ensures total privacy. Yet, several hot wallets still expose user data through IP tracking, linkages to on-chain behavior, and third-party analytics. Powered by zero-knowledge technology, it keeps balances hidden, disguises transactions, and avoids the data leaks common in other tools. Rather than compromising usability for security, it provides both simplicity and enterprise-level defense. Privacy isn't a bonus here, it's the default mode. The native $CWT unit powers system functions such as decentralized governance, access to privacy layers, and user-driven feedback systems. Currently in presale stage 12 at $0.0087, well under the $0.3517 listing target, Cold Wallet creates an appealing setup for early supporters seeking substantial future gains. Those holding $CWT can weigh in on future developments, such as added blockchain support, new features, and collaboration opportunities. As privacy-based platforms gain support across DeFi and broader enterprise sectors, Cold Wallet's early-stage access opens the door to high-potential entry. Rather than acting as a placeholder, $CWT is designed for real use. As adoption grows, so does demand, aligning with a projected 4,900% return. Today's crypto enthusiasts are increasingly looking at usable platforms with actual privacy solutions. Cold Wallet supports both everyday users and professionals without lowering standards for safety or performance. Its growth plan covers browser extensions, mobile features, multi-chain access, and integrations for larger organizations. With tighter privacy laws and scrutiny from regulators, Cold Wallet's purpose becomes more urgent. Analysts forecast its current $0.0087 value could reach $0.71 or beyond if adoption aligns with predictions. Cold Wallet stands out among cryptocurrency ICO projects with its mix of practical function, privacy-first approach, and readiness for real-world usage. This isn't just a product aiming for quick traction. Cold Wallet uses a zero-knowledge base, does not allow external trackers, and gives users full command over how they interact with crypto systems. But beyond numbers, Cold Wallet's practical approach to privacy and user control puts it in a category of its own. Please conduct your own research before taking any action based on the content.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As of 1 pm ET, the token was trading just below $109,000, roughly $3,000 away from touching its all-time intraday high in May. "Over time, bitcoin has proven itself to be a better hedge against inflation than many other asset classes," said Elliot Johnson, CEO of Bitcoin Treasury Corp., an advisory firm that helps companies acquire and hold bitcoin as part of their balance sheets. On Monday, shares of bitcoin juggernaut Strategy (MSTR) jumped more than 4% after the company said it purchased 1,045 more tokens from June 2 to June 8, with total holdings now worth more than $62 billion, according to Bloomberg data. But “MSTR's scale is hard to replicate,” Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani wrote in a May note. “Not every Bitcoin treasury will be successful simply replicating MSTR's playbook, in our view.” Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) shares fell more than 10% during one session in May after the Trump-backed company announced plans to create what it claims will be one of the largest bitcoin treasuries held by any public company. GameStop (GME) stock also slid nearly 25% immediately after the company announced in March it would raise $1.3 billion to buy bitcoin. Corporates now hold roughly 3.4% of all tokens in circulation, according to Bernstein analysis. "Bitcoin is great, we love it and still believe $200K is our high-conviction but conservative price forecast this cycle," wrote Bernstein's Chhugan on Monday. The cryptocurrency is up more than 55% since President Trump, who promised a crypto-friendly framework, was elected last November. Senate Republicans are aiming to pass the bill this week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PARIS, June 10 (Reuters) - France's Societe Generale (SOGN.PA), said on Tuesday it plans to launch a publicly tradable, dollar-backed stablecoin through its digital asset subsidiary, making it the first major bank to enter the growing market of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. The new digital currency, named "USD CoinVertible", will be issued on both the Ethereum and Solana blockchains, with public trading expected to start in July, SocGen's crypto arm SG-FORGE said in a statement.Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to a traditional currency, usually the dollar, allowing people to move large sums of money using blockchain networks instead of traditional banking payment systems. The sector has seen rapid growth, driven by crypto company Tether, which has issued $155 billion of its dollar-pegged tokens.SG-FORGE launched a euro-based stablecoin in 2023, although it has not been widely adopted, with just 41.8 million euros ($47.62 million) in circulation, according to its website. SocGen said its stablecoins are classed as e-money tokens and will be regulated under MiCA, the European Union's landmark crypto regulation adopted in 2023. Tether does not have a licence to operate in the European Union under MiCA. Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SG-FORGE, said that there was demand for a regulated dollar-based stablecoin. The logo of Societe Generale bank is pictured on an office building in Nantes, France, March 16, 2023. The issuers profit by investing these dollar holdings into yield-bearing assets such as bonds. BNY will serve as the custodian for SG-FORGE's reserves, which will initially be kept in a cash account, before later being invested into other assets, Stenger said. SG-FORGE said that its token can be used for crypto trading, cross-border payments, foreign exchange transactions and management of collateral and cash, and will be listed on various crypto exchanges, without giving further details. The subsidiary has "more than 15" crypto exchanges and brokers being onboarded as clients, Stenger added. Bank of America could launch a stablecoin, its CEO said earlier this year, and some other large banks are considering issuing a joint stablecoin. Regulators have long warned that stablecoins could impact market stability by creating connections between mainstream finance and more volatile crypto markets.</p>

On June 10, B2BINPAY analysts shared their insights with crypto.news, the same day Ethereum reached a record level of staking balance. This milestone coincided with an 8% increase in ETH's price on the same day. Simultaneously, Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded their 15th consecutive day of net inflows, totalling $837 million. B2BINPAY analysts say this data suggests institutions may be preparing to rotate capital from Bitcoin into Ethereum, a shift that could significantly increase ETH's market dominance and support gains in other altcoins as well. Meanwhile, this week alone, we've seen over $100 million in ETH purchases, which is a strong signal that institutional investors may be preparing to rotate capital into Ethereum,” B2BINPAY analysts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plasma's highly anticipated ICO (Initial Coin Offering) for its XPL token closed its vaults after raising $500 million from over 1,100 depositors. The event, which marked a dizzying display of capital deployment and gas wars, has raised concerns among community members. While the token has not yet been launched, expectations are already swelling that the final unlock could bring in $1 billion to $2 billion, if not more. We are thrilled that 1,100+ wallets participated, with a median deposit amount of ~$35,000. Amid the headlines and hype, however, a deeper story is emerging. Concerns extend from whale domination and insider access to a growing sense that token launches are increasingly becoming gated events for the crypto elite. The numbers show that only a handful of wallets accounted for outsized allocations. More specifically, the top three contributors alone deployed over $100 million collectively. Perhaps more shocking, one user reportedly paid 39 ETH (approximately $104,871 at current rates of $2,689) in gas fees, which secured them a $10 million USDC allocation. “This guy spent 100k in gas (230,000 Gwei) to get his deposit in for Plasma,” wrote MonaMoon, the founder of the Duck Frens NFT project. Notwithstanding, the frenzy has come at a reputational cost. With whales taking the lion's share, many are calling this launch anything but fair. “…it's an obvious skip for the community…Only 100 wallets with $50 million each… these wallets alone will create an oversubscription of 100x… unfortunately, it's not a fair launch, even though the price is very attractive,” warned an X user  before the raise closed. They will likely only get in later, at 10x to 16x the price. Further, there may be more than just bad optics at play. Crypto trader Hanzo raised serious red flags, suggesting possible coordinated insider behavior. Money laundering or just a huge insider play?Plasma's ICO got filled in 2 minutes:• 100 wallets• $48M funded• source Coinbase PremiumMust-read TRUTH even if you didn't hear about Plasma before 🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/fxTOcbrXy1 “That means insiders had early access to mint and trade. Hosted on Sonar/Echo, dubbed by some as “the CoinList of this cycle,” a time-weighted share of vault deposits determined plasma's deposit period. Participants had to lock stablecoins on Ethereum, with a minimum 40-day lockup. However, with the deposit cap abruptly raised to $500 million and filled almost instantly, many users were left wondering whether this was ever meant to be an open opportunity. Even the technology underpinning Plasma has not escaped scrutiny. A user broke down the chain's architecture and found it lacking. “Plasma is another L1 chain… It uses a ‘classic' pBFT consensus layer, with Proof-of-Stake… and Bitcoin as ‘settlement' by simply publishing state differences… It looks a lot like many alt-L1 EVM forks… It surfs on the Bitcoin “side-chain” marketing campaign and is pushed by influencors.. but I am not convinced at all,” the user noted. In his view, Plasma's use of influencers and Bitcoin branding is more marketing veneer than technical substance. Zaheer from SplitCapital praised the distribution, noting a broad holder distribution with over 1,100 wallets and only one wallet holding $50 million. According to Zaheer, this contrasts with the typical whale-dominated ICOs and suggests a more inclusive allocation strategy. Plasma's ICO serves as a mirror to today's market mechanics, where speed, size, and for some, connections, often matter more than innovation or accessibility. Whether Plasma becomes a foundational chain or another cautionary tale will depend on the unlock numbers and how its ecosystem fairs beyond the ICO hype.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Binance and Coinbase secure over 15% of staked ETH, spotlighting centralized staking influence. The validator count stands at 1,088,277, and staking activity is pushing upward after a period of consolidation and a brief decline earlier in the month. Centralized exchanges Binance and Coinbase follow, with 2.65 million and 2.59 million ETH staked, respectively, representing a combined share of over 15%. Notably, ether.fi, a liquid restaking platform, continues to gain traction with 2.25 million ETH, up 16% over the past month. Beaconcha.in data shows consistent staking growth since Ethereum's Beacon Chain launch, with accelerated deposits following the Merge, Shapella, and Dencun upgrades. The move follows a temporary plateau earlier this month, rising market volumes, and upward momentum since June 9. Despite Lido's dominance, its share is down 2% over the past month and 9% over six months, reflecting broader diversification in the staking landscape. Platforms such as Blockdaemon and Rocket Pool show strong medium-term growth, with the former up 85% over six months, signaling increased adoption of decentralized and institutional staking options.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FILE - Donald Trump speaks at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference July 27, 2024, in Nashville, Tenn. President Donald Trump's media company just announced a plan to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, joining a growing number of so-called “bitcoin treasury companies” as the world's most popular cryptocurrency hits all-time highs. The companies buy bitcoin for different reasons: Some hold it as a hedge against inflation or to signal support for the cryptocurrency industry, while some firms have made using debt and stock sales to buy bitcoin their primary business strategy. The massive increases in some firms' stock price may seem to validate LeClair's bravado, but there are plenty of warnings that a downturn in bitcoin's prices could lead to large selloffs. Here's a look at bitcoin treasury companies by the numbers: That's how many bitcoins owned by MicroStrategy – the undisputed goliath of bitcoin treasury companies. It also owns more bitcoin than every nation state combined, according to the tracking site bitcointreasuries.net. Now called Strategy, the software company first started buying bitcoin in 2020 with reserve cash. That's how much MicroStrategy's stock price has increased in the last five years, compared to around 1,000% gain in bitcoin and the 1,500% jump for chipmaker and stock market darling Nvidia during that same period. Geoff Kendrick, the bank's head of digital assets research, said in the report that restrictions on investors buying bitcoin directly help explain the popularity of bitcoin treasury companies, as their stocks can serve as bitcoin proxies. He added that bitcoin's volatility could force some newer bitcoin treasury companies to sell their holdings to satisfy their debts if it falls under the purchase price. “The question then becomes, how much pain can companies withstand before being forced to sell their BTC?” Kendrick said, referring to the symbol for bitcoin. That's how much of a one-day percentage increase in stock prices firms have seen after recently announcing plans to hold other types of cryptocurrencies as corporate treasuries, highlighting how the appetite for such companies extends beyond bitcoin. SharpLink Gaming, a gambling marketing firm, saw its share price increase by more than 400% after it announced plans to buy up to $425 million in Ethereum, the second most popular form of cryptocurrency. And crypto firm Upexi saw its stock price soar more than 300% after it announced plans to buy $100 million of Solana, a cryptocurrency popular in the meme coin ecosystem.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From June 16 to 22, 2025, Basel becomes home to the inaugural edition of Digital Art Mile— a new and ambitious initiative by ArtMeta that transforms the historic Rebgasse district into a vibrant epicenter for digital creativity. This week-long event runs in parallel with Art Basel and offers a curated alternative that addresses a conspicuous absence: digital art. With exhibitions, robotic installations, and conferences led by global voices in art and culture, Digital Art Mile invites both industry professionals and curious publics to rethink the boundaries of art in a digital age. For first-time visitors, Digital Art Mile offers a paradigm shift. ArtMeta seeks to convince the skeptics that digital art isn't just about speculation and NFTs— it's about a rich, evolving art form rooted in dialogue and human imagination. The platform originally emerged from their mutual desire to elevate digital art beyond novelty, rooting it instead within a broader historical and cultural narrative. For its 2025 Basel edition, ArtMeta introduces the Digital Art Mile, conceived as a boutique fair with curated exhibitions and educational programming. Unlike conventional commercial events, its focus lies in thematic cohesion and historical dialogue, linking the legacy of early digital pioneers to the cutting edge of blockchain, AI, and Web3. Through its growing curatorial reach, ArtMeta positions itself as an anchor point in the evolving landscape of digital-native cultural production. Digital Art Mile 2025 offers an immersive entry point into the pluralistic worlds of digital art, from generative image-making and robotics to blockchain-based collecting and AI-driven creativity. Beyond exhibitions, the fair includes a four-day conference series at Kult.Kino Cinema that brings together leading thinkers such as Christiane Paul (Whitney Museum), Ian Charles Stewart (Toledo Museum Labs), Sebastien Borget (The Sandbox), and Prof. Dr. Thomas Girst (BMW). Through these multi-perspective discussions, the fair aims not only to showcase the state of digital art but also to create frameworks for its institutional integration, economic viability, and cultural resonance. Paintboxed positions this forgotten chapter of digital history in conversation with the present. Artists including Justin Aversano, Grant Yun, Ivona Tau, Hackatao, and Simon Denny were invited to create new works using one of the few remaining functional Paintboxes. Tau even collaborated with ChatGPT to receive step-by-step generative painting instructions, blurring the boundaries between human intuition and AI guidance. These new creations are displayed in lightboxes and paired with NFTs minted on the Tezos Foundation blockchain, allowing collectors to own dual manifestations of the same work—both analog and digital. Historic pioneers such as Waldemar Cordeiro, Manfred Mohr, and Joan Truckenbrod are spotlighted by Mayor Gallery, RCM, and Galerie Charlot, positioning digital art within a longer, often overlooked lineage. Digital Art Mile expands its cultural footprint with a robust conference series held at Kult.Kino Cinema on June 17 and 18. The talks tackle vital topics such as the role of digital art in museums, the evolution of AI-generated creativity, and how corporations are adopting NFTs and digital aesthetics into their branding and storytelling. Notable sessions include ‘Digital Art in Museums' featuring Christiane Paul and Ian Charles Stewart, and ‘Digital Art in Corporations,' moderated by designboom, with insights from BMW's Prof. Dr. Thomas Girst and Sandbox's Sebastien Borget. A particular point of interest is the integration of crypto culture in legacy institutions and how corporate players like UBS, Arab Bank, and luxury brands are shaping their own digital art narratives. By building a space where curated exhibitions meet educational discourse, the fair aspires to become the leading marketplace and forum for digital art worldwide.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is collaborating with Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to evaluate secure transactions between the digital Hong Kong dollar (e-HKD) and a stablecoin pegged to the Australian dollar. This study, part of the e-HKD+ Pilot Program, unites international financial leaders such as Visa, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), ChinaAMC, and Fidelity International. The pilot demonstrates Chainlink's ability to connect different blockchain environments, allowing instant and secure settlement. In the test, the protocol allowed simultaneous transfer, known as atomic settlement, between ANZ's A$DC stablecoin and Hong Kong's e-HKD. This method lowers the risk of either party failing to deliver, which is a key concern in international payments. These features include those to support regulatory requirements, like identity verification, which is included in the latter. These elements aim to ensure that cross-border digital asset transfer is conducted securely and transparently. This innovation solves the challenges that financial institutions have in optimizing the movement of assets between private, controlled networks and public blockchain environments. Eleven corporate groups are exploring different use cases for the e-HKD, with final findings expected by late 2025. Visa and industry analysts believe tokenized assets could reach a $10 trillion market size by 2030, while stablecoins may see a $3.7 trillion market by then. These advancements also provided operational benefits and new opportunities, according to Emma Pecenicic of Fidelity International. Additionally, Chainlink's decentralized oracle network, which secures over $21 trillion in transaction value across more than 50 blockchains, remains a critical component of this cross-border digital asset exchange.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chainlink LINK/USD is experiencing a strong rally, trading above $14 and gaining around 7% in the last 24 hours. The rise follows a successful trial program in which Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) enabled a record cross-border transaction between an Australian dollar stablecoin and Hong Kong's central bank digital currency (CBDC). The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) e-HKD+ Pilot Programme has reached a major milestone. Chainlink's CCIP has successfully enabled the first real-world simulation of programmable money for cross-border investment in tokenized assets. It usually takes two to three days for a transaction to settle, but it happened almost instantly, showing that blockchain might get rid of middlemen and lower the risks of cross-border transactions. With CCIP now live on dozens of blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana Virtual Machine-compatible networks, this achievement makes Chainlink a key infrastructure supplier in the changing world of digital banking. The coin has made a great comeback from its crucial support level of $12.59, rising 11.40% and staying that way through Tuesday's trading session. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is very close to a bullish crossover on the daily chart, which is more crucial. This would be a strong buying signal and confirm the rising trend. Volume analysis shows that there is a lot of purchasing demand, with more than 1 million LINK exchanged during the breakout session at 10:00 UTC. Coinglass data shows that LINK's long-to-short ratio has reached 1.25, the highest level in more than a month. This ratio is above 1.0, which means that traders are quite bullish on the market. More traders are betting on prices going up than down. Traders seem to be setting up for more upside because Chainlink's real-world use in financial infrastructure is growing. If the current bullish trend keeps up, LINK might reach its May 29 high of $16.19, which is about 11% higher than where it is now. Traders should keep an eye on the $12.59 support level, because any drop below this level could mean that bearish sentiment is coming back. The present technical breakout is supported by the fact that tokenized asset markets are expected to be worth more than $2 trillion by 2030 and Chainlink is positioning itself as an important part of cross-border digital finance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kathleen Kinder, Senior Editor at CoinLaw, brings over 8 years of experience in the research…... | See full bio The ICO boom of 2017–2018 was a digital gold rush. Some of the most well-funded projects failed spectacularly, due to scams, legal issues, or poor execution. These weren't just minor missteps; they burned through hundreds of millions of dollars and shattered investor trust across the crypto world. Using Ethereum's ERC-20 standard, projects could easily mint tokens, slap on a whitepaper, and raise millions, sometimes in minutes. Investors, driven by hype and the fear of missing out, poured over $20 billion into ICOs during this period. The ICO era saw billions raised on bold promises, many of which collapsed spectacularly. This ranked list spotlights the 10 most expensive ICO failures based on how much they raised before falling apart due to scams, legal issues, or mismanagement. AriseBank claimed to be the world's first decentralized bank but operated without regulatory approval. LoopX promised automated crypto trading powered by AI but disappeared overnight after collecting millions. Plexcoin lured investors with promises of 1,354% returns in under a month—an obvious red flag. COMSA, launched by Tech Bureau, aimed to streamline blockchain adoption in Japan. But after its parent exchange, Zaif was hacked, trust evaporated, and the project lost momentum. Envion promoted mobile crypto mining units and raised big, but quickly fell into legal disputes between the founders and investors. It resulted in a controversial Ethereum hard fork and permanently ended the project. Tezos raised massive funds but was paralyzed by internal legal conflicts between its founders and the foundation. Although it eventually launched, the delays and lawsuits damaged its reputation. Dragon Coin targeted the Asian gambling market and was allegedly linked to criminal syndicates. Despite its huge rise, it failed to deliver and left investors with near-worthless tokens. TON was one of the most ambitious ICOs ever, launched by Telegram to create a decentralized internet. Each one highlights different failure points, from outright fraud to mismanagement and security flaws. While each failure had its own story, many shared common red flags, like unrealistic promises, lack of a working product, and regulatory blind spots. Some failed ICOs disappeared without a trace, while others morphed into functioning, though diminished, projects. But with new trends constantly emerging, the question remains: Has the space truly learned, or is history set to repeat itself? But new fundraising formats like memecoin pre-sales, NFT-based raises, and DAO treasuries suggest that risk still lives on. They revealed what happens when greed outpaces governance, and how quickly billions can evaporate in the absence of structure. These stories are more than historic footnotes, they're reminders that in the Web3 world, transparency, trust, and accountability are the only true currencies of lasting value.
