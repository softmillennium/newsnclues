                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But if there's one thing Fifa likes, it's grossly expanded tournaments and the Club World Cup is no exception. Since the tournament started in 2000, it usually featured six or seven teams representing Fifa's various confederations. But this is a World Cup, so the teams are mainly made up of clubs who have won their respective continental championships over the last four years (so, for example, recent winners of the Champions League get in from Europe). There are more places for teams from stronger federations such as Europe's Uefa (12 slots) and South America's Conmebol (six slots) than weaker federations (Oceania's OFC gets just one). The US got an extra slot as tournament hosts, meaning their domestic champion from 2024 would qualify. Most fans would say that would be the MLS Cup champion, which is decided after a post-season playoff competition (the 2024 champion was Los Angeles Galaxy). The best two teams in New Zealand, Auckland FC and Wellington Phoenix, play in Australia's A-League, which is part of the Asian Football Confederation. Urawa Red Diamonds, Japan (winners of the 2022 AFC Champions League) Ulsan, South Korea (best-ranked eligible team in the AFC four-year ranking) Espérance de Tunis, Tunisia (best-ranked eligible team in the Caf four-year ranking) Mamelodi Sundowns, South Africa (second-best ranked eligible team in the Caf four-year ranking) River Plate, Argentina (best-ranked eligible team in the Conmebol four-year ranking) Boca Juniors, Argentina (second-best ranked eligible team in the Conmebol four-year ranking) Bayern Munich, Germany (best-ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking) Paris Saint-Germain, France (second-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking) Internazionale, Italy (fourth-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking) Porto, Portugal (fifth-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking) Benfica, Portugal (seventh-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking) Borussia Dortmund, Germany (Third-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking) Juventus, Italy (Eighth-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking) Atlético Madrid, Spain (Sixth-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking) Red Bull Salzburg, Austria (Ninth-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking) Fifpro, the global players' union, said adding another month to an already crowded calendar is a health risk. Just over half of that total goes to the clubs just for being there, and different teams have received differently-sized payouts for their participation, depending on where they hail from. South American sides get $15.21m, while European teams will get anywhere from $12.81m to $38.19m, depending on what Fifa calls “sporting and commercial criteria” (in other words: how famous and good they are). Different teams will distribute the winnings to players differently according to a number of factors, but that doesn't mean players are happy with that arrangement. Say one thing for the man: he's not easy to predict. Will host group stage matches, quarter-final, both semi-finals and final. Formerly known as the Citrus Bowl, it's hosted a number of major college gridiron football and in a previous live, games during the 1994 World Cup. This is the home stadium of MLS side Nashville SC, opened in 2022. This is the home stadium of MLS side FC Cincinnati, opened in 2021. The home venue for MLS side Orlando City, opened in 2017. The home venue of MLS side DC United, opened in 2018. Consider the tournament's opening match, between Inter Miami and Al Alhy. But it'll be fun to watch him in a tournament setting again. Omar Marmoush, Manchester City – The Egyptian made a big impact since joining City in January from Eintracht Frankfurt, scoring eight goals in all competitions including a memorable thunderbolt v Bournemouth. The England international leads a Chelsea team stocked with young talent. Real Madrid and River Plate are currently locked in transfer talks according to multiple reports – the only question now is if he'll stay with his current side through the Club World Cup, or move earlier. Thomas Müller, Bayern Munich – the 35-year-old had already bid goodbye to his home fans, but the Club World Cup will be his last competition in a Bayern Munich shirt. Weston McKennie, Juventus – Playing in his home country for the first time in competitive club matches, there's almost no telling what role McKennie will play for Juventus. The US international has played in just about every midfield spot and even occasionally at wingback in what was a disappointing season for Juve, which they'll hope to put behind them with a solid showing. Estêvão, Palmeiras – The 18-year-old forward, like Mastantuono, is one of his country's brightest young stars. He has agreed to join Chelsea in a transfer after the tournament, so this will be his last chance to make a mark before moving abroad. PSG are a decent bet, given their demolition of Inter in the Champions League final and their collection of young talent that is willing to work. Real Madrid, of course, can never be counted out in a tournament setting, and Trent Alexander-Arnold will be looking to impress in his first actions for his new club. Manchester City closed a disappointing Premier League season in great form. But given the other sides involved, it's hard to be all that confident.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brazil can punch their tickets to the 2026 FIFA World Cup when they take on Paraguay at Neo Química Arena. The Seleção got its CONMEBOL 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers off to a poor start under former manager Dorival Junior. Under new boss Carlo Ancelotti, Brazil are hoping to solidify their place in the United States, Canada and Mexico next summer as soon as possible. Let's take a look at just what results need to occur on June 10 for Brazil to qualify for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Brazil must defeat Paraguay in São Paulo if they want to have a chance of qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup on June 10. The easiest pathway to qualification for Brazil would be if Uruguay defeat Venezuela. La Celeste would normally be the favorites to walk away with a victory, but the team is coming off a poor 2–0 loss to Paraguay. Brazil will hope Uruguay can bounce back and secure three points to help the Seleção get one step closer to the 2026 FIFA World Cup. If Uruguay only manage a draw, then Brazil also need Argentina to defeat Colombia. Barring any delays, Brazil will have a good idea of Uruguay's result before they kick off. Should Venezuela come out with a victory, then Brazil cannot qualify for the 2026 FIFA World Cup on June 10 regardless of their result against Paraguay.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A year from now, the most expansive World Cup in history will kick off on North American soil, but you might not know it from walking through any of the 11 U.S. host cities. Any soccer-themed billboards or Instagram advertising splashes are conspicuously absent. That the World Cup is coming is no secret, but the visible signs that we're at a 12-month countdown are few and far between. So why hasn't there been more of a push? And why did the year-out marker pass by this week with so little domestic fanfare? “It is kind of like the Club World Cup. We did not see a lot of action around it either,” Dave Wakeman of Wakeman Consulting, a strategy firm focused on sports, told The Athletic. There are several reasons U.S. host cities have not moved faster. For starters, many key details are still up in the air. Host cities do not know which matches they'll stage, the official draw isn't until December, and unless you are eyeing premium hospitality packages that cost thousands of dollars, tickets for the general public aren't even on sale yet. With no significant financial help from FIFA, host cities are also juggling the responsibility of finding funds they need to use for promoting the event, multiple industry insiders told The Athletic. “You want to have an action plan that builds 90-180 days out. You are counting on people coming from around the world, but in the current environment, you have to rely on American tourists more than usual.” In most cases, the slow rollout appears to be a calculated move. At least that's the reason one host city, San Francisco, is making sure it is using its resources efficiently. Starting Wednesday, many host cities will kick off their “One Year Out” activations, following San Francisco's lead. Then on Sunday, which is exactly one year before Seattle hosts its first World Cup match, the host committee will team up with the Seattle Reign and Seattle Sounders to attempt a Guinness World Record for world's largest soccer clinic. In Houston, the host committee will host an exclusive event with city officials and potential donors, featuring former USMNT captain Carlos Bocanegra. Despite being thoughtful about a big marketing push later in 2026, San Francisco is also planning on kicking off the marketing campaign with a plaque unveiling at the stadium with the city of Santa Clara on Wednesday and a speaking event with some of the biggest names in soccer from the Bay Area, including San Jose Earthquakes coach Bruce Arena, Brady Stewart of Bay FC and Aly Wagner, former USWNT legend and one of the owners of Bay FC. There will also be a free, open clinic and a community festival in San Jose on Saturday for the public. Meanwhile, in Canada and Mexico, some of their host cities are already pitching things with posters revealed in public spaces to hype soccer fans. But perhaps one of the most bizarre ways to kick off the World Cup promotions happened a few weeks ago in New York. “The Lincoln Tunnel Challenge 5K is a perfect reflection of what FIFA World Cup 26 NYNJ is all about, connecting the two great states of NY and NJ, and the entire region through athleticism, passion, and community spirit,” a statement from Boden read. It may have been an odd way to build buzz around the World Cup, but for organizers, even a weird stunt like this signals a shift from vague hype to decisions and the beginning of the final push. “How does it feel to be one year out? “The good news is that the decisions start to get made instead of being in this phase where you're planning and thinking. Understanding that the World Cup is coming next year, and I think it's actually going to be a really, really great tournament.” She has reported on the global game since 2013, for TRT Sport, USA Today Sports, VICE, Forbes, and most recently was a staff writer at Sportico.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daichi Kamada scored twice as Japan rounded off their successful World Cup qualifying campaign with a 6-0 thrashing of Patrick Kluivert's Indonesia in Osaka. Kamada, an FA Cup winner with Crystal Palace in England this season, struck twice in Tuesday's first half as already-qualified Japan finished their campaign as Group C winners, scoring 30 goals in their 10 matches. Takefusa Kubo, Ryoya Morishita, Shuto Machino and substitute Mao Hosoya were also on target against Indonesia, who finished fourth in the group. Kluivert's side, who were backed by a large number of supporters who had travelled to Japan, advanced to a further round with five other teams to decide two more Asian qualifiers for next year's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico. His side will play friendlies against teams from outside Asia over the next 12 months, and Kamada is looking to learn from the experience. We need to come together as a team and overcome these problems when they crop up.” Japan have already lined up away friendlies against Mexico and the US in September and will face four as yet unnamed opponents at home before the end of the year. Moriyasu said his players need to keep improving “in all departments” and praised their attitude against Indonesia. “They did that in training and in the game, where they were never satisfied and always looking for the next goal and the next chance, which is great to see.” Japan lost their unbeaten qualifying record in a 1-0 defeat away to Australia last week, with coach Hajime Moriyasu fielding an experimental lineup with qualification already in the bag. He started with two more debutants against Indonesia, handing first caps to defender Junnosuke Suzuki and winger Shunsuke Mito. The Palace forward turned provider for his team's second, combining with Kubo before the Real Sociedad man fired past Indonesia goalkeeper Emil Audero. Indonesia lost defender Kevin Diks to injury midway through the first half, and his replacement, Yakob Sayuri, lasted only 15 minutes before he also had to go off after a clash of heads.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kante is on the books for Saudi Pro League rivals Al Ittihad. However, Al Hilal are the only Saudi side to qualify for the Club World Cup and are keen to take Kante with them. Al-Hilal and Al Ittihad are both controlled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, while central Saudi dealmakers also see value in Kante switching clubs believing he will raise Hilal's profile during the Club World Cup. Al Hilal begin their tournament against Real Madrid in Miami on June 18 and have been keen to add marquee names ahead of that fixture, which will also see former Inter boss Simone Inzaghi make his debut. Al Hilal retained the central budget originally allocated for Mohamed Salah's wages had he left Liverpool, giving them over £500m to spend this summer. The Riyadh-based club tried for Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes and Napoli striker Victor Osimhen and talkSPORT understands they even made a late call on Monday about Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko. Atlanta's Ederson, Inter's Nicola Barella and Aston Villa's Youri Tielemans were all also approached, while deals for Roma's Angelino and Milan's Theo Hernandez fell through. Hilal may revisit some of their these targets after the Club World Cup. Ronaldo is now expected to extend at Al Nassr. Kante is more open to a temporary switch. The 34-year-old has made 81 appearances for Al Ittiahd since leaving Chelsea in summer 2023, and won the Saudi Pro League title last season. Should an agreement be reached on Tuesday, Kante will join Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ruben Neves and be reunited with his former Chelsea teammate Kalidou Koulibaly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A lot of people are dismissing the new Club World Cup, but it could prove to be a very important tournament for Chelsea and their players. It is thought that Chelsea could earn up to £97m in prize money if they go on to win the whole thing. They have already signed Liam Delap from Ipswich Town to give them a boost heading into their opening game against Los Angeles FC. Delap, who was at Cobham on Monday despite not needing to report in until Tuesday, will be hoping to start that match. At one stage, it looked like AC Milan star Mike Maignan would be starting in goal for Chelsea at the Club World Cup. Chelsea were working on signing Maignan but eventually decided to exit talks with Milan after failing to reach an agreement with them over a transfer fee. No expectation currently that Chelsea will sign Mike Maignan today. As we stand it is not expected to happen in time for today's 7pm deadline #cfc After a fantastic season at Strasbourg, Petrovic may fancy his chances when competing against Robert Sanchez and Filip Jorgensen. And if Petrovic takes it, Chelsea may decide to keep hold of the 25-year-old this summer rather than sell him. In April, it was claimed that either Petrovic or Sanchez will be sold, with Chelsea wanting to keep hold of Jorgensen and Mike Penders</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SEATTLE — FIFA World Cup 2026 play may be one year out, but security plans for the major soccer event have been in the works for nearly two years. The goal is to make sure fans and players are safe while enjoying the thrill of matches played in host cities like Seattle. Former Seattle Police Chief John Diaz is the chief security officer for Seattle FIFA World Cup 2026 operations. Diaz said fans can expect to see a number of law enforcement officers and safety personnel, including police patrols, private security, World Cup ambassadors, and volunteers, in and around Lumen Field. Working with federal agencies like Homeland Security for years now, the FIFA World Cup's 16 host cities are primed to kick off their respective matches. Diaz told KING 5 the key to securing this magnitude of a sports event is collaboration. "Here in this state, it's going to require all the resources that we bring in - mutual aid and others from both the police and our fire, our state local and our federal resources," Diaz said. The federation not only established three host countries and 16 host cities - it has bumped up the number of teams that will play from 32 to 48. The first of six Seattle-based matches is set for June 15, 2026. By then - the Seattle security team will have logged about three years of planning efforts. "I think right now we have 27 work groups here in the state that have different pieces of the plan, and so we're looking at everything," Diaz said. An estimated 750,000 people are expected to descend upon the Emerald City and surrounding areas for FIFA World Cup 2026. Keeping that many people safe is a challenge and poses several potential risks. Security plans for FIFA World Cup 2026 will apply to the nine designated Fan Zones across Washington state.These zones were created to "ensure that as many Washingtonians as possible can be part of this historic event." FIFA said Specific locations within each city will be announced ahead of the tournament. What can you do to make World Cup match days fun and safe? -Arrive early and don't linger outside Lumen Field. Exterior areas need to be secured as well. This policy is likely new for international visitors.</p>

Diego Luna woke up in a daze, unaware of his newfound US men's national team cult-hero status.

Real Salt Lake's star midfielder had just gotten out of surgery to repair a broken nose sustained during a 3-0 friendly win over Costa Rica in January – a defining performance that was equal parts guts and talent, with the 21-year-old sporting gauze to stop the bleeding while he assisted Brian White's opening strike at Inter&Co Stadium.

“My family was there and my agents, and they were calling me ‘Big Balls' and all this stuff,” Luna said in Off The Ball, the league's new video feature series.

“It was hilarious. I thought my robe was showing or something.”

Little did Luna know, the moniker came from none other than USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino, who famously praised the 2024 MLS Young Player of the Year's proverbial testicular fortitude during a memorable post-game interview.

“He meant that I was determined to play for my country, fighting through things and stuff like that,” Luna said. “It was super cool and I think it might've been the best decision of my life to continue to play with a broken nose, right?

“'Cause it's shown people a side of me and it's opened doors.”

Luna, who will look to open more doors at this summer's 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup with the USMNT, discussed his rising profile, focus on mental health and love of body art – all while getting a new tattoo – in the premiere episode of Off The Ball.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Harriel's ability to be a man of many positions earned him his senior debut for the national team. Harriel rebounded from an early-season injury and returned to the pitch in late March. From the inside looking out, everyone who works with Harriel, from coaches to teammates, attests to a work ethic that made it little surprise when his name ended up on the U.S. men's national team roster for summer training camp. “It's always an honor to be on that list for the U.S. national team,” Harriel said shortly before leaving to join the team's camp last week in Chicago. Harriel's intangibles are not quite what you'd expect from the typical defensive-minded player. For starters, he's unafraid to break out of the Union's third and attack opposing defenders, using his speed to zoom past. He won't necessarily outsmart foes with impressive moves; he instead relies on every inch of a 5-foot-10, 150-pound frame to keep defenders at bay and pose a consistent threat in the final third. Early this season, Harriel missed multiple weeks with a nagging thigh injury. Still, with two goals this year, he's already matched his total from last season. His first goal came May 14 vs. the L.A. Galaxy, and the second was a well-timed header off a Union restart that Toronto goalkeeper Sean Johnson had no chance of snagging. “He's excellent in the air,” said Union manager Bradley Carnell. So, really, he has a good range and awareness of when to do what [he has to do to create opportunities], and that's what brought him into this window of selection for the Gold Cup.” Harriel's versatility for the Union undoubtedly is what got him noticed by U.S. boss Mauricio Pochettino. Harriel admitted that his game is always a work in progress, but it's gotten him looks from Pochettino just one year out from the World Cup, a tournament with a great deal of uncertainty for American fans — and even for some players. » READ MORE: USMNT's Mauricio Pochettino gives ‘guarantee that we are going to compete' at Gold Cup Harriel's thigh injury “was really unfortunate timing,” Carnell said. We've had him in multiple positions, but that's because of the qualities he possesses as a player.” “Like I said before, playing for your country is an honor that not many players will get to do. » READ MORE: Follow the Inquirer's complete coverage of all things soccer right here!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Transfer news latest as clubs have until 19:00 BST to make new signings - Tuesday's timings Latest: BVB reject Chelsea's €50m Gittens offer | Will Reijnders sign before CWC? | Cherki updates | Man Utd set to open Mbeumo talks - plus the latest on some of this summer's big deals Get Involved: #bbcfootball, via WhatsApp on 03301231826 or text 81111 (UK only, standard message rates apply) Ian Wright was around 27/28 when he joined Arsenal and went on to score 128 league goals in the top flight for them, on top of the 28 league goals he'd already got in the First Division for Palace. Viktor Gyokeres might also be a "late bloomer" so his age is pretty irrelevant at this stage. With just 30 minutes to go before today's transfer deadline, here is a reminder of the main stories and completed deals we have had so far: With Rayan Ait-Nouri already through the door and Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki expected to follow imminently [just over 30 minutes to complete] - Manchester City could be fielding a new-look XI when they take on Wydad AC at the Club World Cup on 18 June. Should Reijnders and Cherki get done in time for the competition getting under way - this could be the starting side that Pep Guardiola fields next week. For example, Man united will look to sign Mbuemo in the next transfer window as it will effectively knock on PSR incomes/losses to the following year. Hence why most of us know Mbeumo is going to United but none of that deal will officially happen until the next deadline as it makes sound business sense to wait. Arsenal have long been admirers of Benjamin Sesko, but interest from Saudi Arabia may drive up RB Leipzig's asking price for the striker. Leipzig reportedly wanted 80m euros (£68m), but according to the Telegraph, external, interest from two Saudi Arabian clubs could increase that. During his stint in the Championship with Coventry, the Sporting striker - who has been linked with a move to Manchester United - has scored three goals against Stoke in five games. He is also considerably cheaper than Ekitike, Sesko and Osimhen. As well as Tijjani Reijnders, Manchester City are hoping to complete the signing of Lyon midfielder Rayan Cherki before tonight's transfer deadline in less than an hour. City and Lyon have reportedly agreed upon a £30.5m fee, plus add-ons worth about £4.2m. Both Chelsea and Manchester City know that, if they want to register a new player in time to join their squad for the upcoming Club World Cup, this is the time. They must submit those squads by the end of today. Gyokeres has scored precisely zero goals in a top five league - he is 27! One transfer that has got over the line during this window is Spain defender Dean Huijsen's switch from Bournemouth to Real Madrid for £50million. He signed his contract at the club's training ground, alongside president Florentino Perez. Huijsen, who was born in the Netherlands but moved to Spain aged five, has earned four senior caps for the Spanish national team following a breakout season. "I've wanted to be here since day one," Huijsen said. "Since Madrid called, I've had no other team in mind." "I'm coming to the best club in the world and I'm here to give it my all with humility, and hopefully we can win many trophies together. It's been almost a week since Manchester City agreed a 55m euros (£46.3m) deal with AC Milan for Netherlands midfielder Tijjani Reijnders - so why hasn't he joined yet? According to multiple reports - including Fabrizio , externalRomano - Reijnders completed a medical with City over the weekend, and has now agreed personal terms. His transfer should be officially completed tonight, barring unforeseen complications. There is no sense that an agreement has been reached, but how many transfer sagas have run on past a midnight deadline in the past? This transfer saga may be over - for now - but let's not rule anything out just yet. He is not going to suddenly change his mind for Spurs now! Gittens, 20, is a Borussia Dortmund player, as it stands, after the Bundesliga side rejected an offer of 50m euros (£42.2m). But if Chelsea up their bid before today's 7pm transfer deadline then that could change. If that happens, will Gittens be wearing blue or yellow? With 90 minutes to go before today's transfer deadline, let's recap the main stories and completed deals we have had so far: Brown was Tierney's team-mate when he broke through at the Scottish champions and believes the deal is a “really good fit” for both parties. “Longer term, Kieran will be Celtic captain,” Brown told BBC Sport Scotland. “He's nowhere near coming to the end of his career. #bbcfootball, via WhatsApp on 03301231826 or text 81111 (UK only, standard message rates apply) Don't worry about those Man City deals for Cherki and Reijnders as they are done. Club just waiting to announce them with the right content package. Kevin de Bruyne finally looks set to sign a contract with Napoli, which will take effect when his contract at Manchester City expires later this month. According to journalists Matteo Moretto, external and Fabrizio Romano, external, De Bruyne, 33, and Napoli have agreed upon a two-year contract with the option of an additional year.</p>

CARY, N.C. — Former U.S. women's national team stars Carli Lloyd, Ali Krieger, Heather O'Reilly, and the US Women claimed their second consecutive $1 million prize in The Soccer Tournament's women's bracket on Monday. Looking to repeat their triumph from the inaugural women's event last summer, the US Women reloaded with additional USWNT veterans and five current players from the University of North Carolina. After joining the staff as an assistant coach in 2024, Lloyd returned to the field as a player for TST 2025, marking her first competitive appearance since retiring in 2021. Evelyn Shores slotted home the winning goal off a O'Reilly assist 13 minutes into Target Score Time to secure the team's second straight title. In the men's final, Bumpy Pitch FC defeated Pumas de Alabama, 2-1. Trailing 1-0 entering Target Score Time, Bumpy Pitch capitalized on mistakes from Pumas de Alabama, scoring two goals — including the $1 million winner from Charlie Gonzalez. The men's bracket all-tournament team included: Sergio Agüero (Seleccion Potrero), Oumar Niasse (Pasha Luxury FC), Ricardinho (Nani FC), Drew Ruggles (The CONCAFA SC), Jose Antonio Medina Alvarado (Pumas de Alabama), Cristian Martinez Borja (Bumpy Pitch FC), and Hugo Gomez (Bumpy Pitch FC). The Soccer Tournament welcomed more than 50,000 attendees over six days, and featured players from 34 countries. More information about TST and the 2025 tournament can be found at tst7v7.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Club World Cup ‘Harms La Liga': Tebas Warns of Madrid Fixture Chaos originally appeared on Athlon Sports. This newly formatted competition has had a mixed reaction from soccer fans around the world. Many fans dreamed of watching the worlds top clubs face off around the world have the chance to play each other, but others find it unnecessary to bring this competition to life. La Liga President Javier Tebas spoke to COPE and was asked his opinion of the Madrid clubs participating in the competition. Tebas doesn't understand the point of having the competition other than being a financial benefit for clubs participating in it. Javier Tebas: "The Club World Cup is a complete nonsense. And then there is the other issue, when will Real Madrid and Atlético be able to start the league matches." With Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid being top clubs, it is possible for them to reach the latest rounds of the Club World Cup. Along with that, rest time for players will be significantly reduced. Tebas is remains firmly opposed to the Club World Cup and does not want to change calendar dates for the new season. Javier Tebas: "We have to see and study it. It cannot be that we are constantly changing our calendars for other competitions, FIFA expects all leagues to adapt without consulting us. A Madrid derby in the first matchday is impossible." COPE reports that the Association of Spanish Footballers (AFE) has spoken with Real Madrid's Dani Carvajal and Atletico Madrid's Koke on a potential delay in the upcoming La Liga season. It could be as late as August 24 that either or both clubs could play their first league game of the new season if they become the last eight teams of the Club World Cup this summer. Real Madrid is in Group H with Al Hilal, Pachuca, and RB Salzburg. Atletico Madrid is in Group B along with Botafogo, Seattle Sounders, and PSG. They will make their debut on Sunday, June 15, against the newly crowned European Champions, PSG.
