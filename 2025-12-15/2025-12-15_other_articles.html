                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adam Scott has plenty of experience with the horrific and weird, having starred in the likes of Severance, Little Evil, Krampus, Piranha 3D, and Hellraiser: Bloodline. Earlier this year, we learned that he's adding to his genre résumé with the supernatural horror film Hokum, which was filmed on location in Ireland. A few months ago, it was announced that NEON and Waypoint Entertainment's Cweature Features have boarded the project, with NEON planning to give the film a theatrical release in the United States on May 1, 2026. Hokum is coming our way from writer/director Damian McCarthy, whose horror film Oddity is said to have “caused a stir after premiering at SXSW, where it won the audience award in the Midnighter section.” That movie made its way out into the world last summer, telling the story of “a blind medium and curio shopkeeper who is still grieving the death of her twin sister a year prior when a wooden mannequin from her collection becomes crucial to her quest to uncover the truth about her sister's murder.” The story McCarthy has crafted for Hokum will see Scott taking on the role of a horror novelist who visits a remote Irish inn to spread his parents' ashes, unaware the place is rumored to be haunted by a witch. Here's the synopsis: When reclusive novelist Ohm Bauman (Scott) retreats to a remote Irish inn to scatter his parents' ashes, the staff's tales of an ancient witch haunting the honeymoon suite take hold of his mind. Scott is joined in the cast by Peter Coonan (Bad Sisters) and David Wilmot (Bodkin). Ben Ross, Dan Kagan, Rami Yasin, and Andrew Childs serve as executive producers. Cweature Features' Ken Kao and Josh Rosenbaum are executive producers as well. The project is also supported by co-production funding from Screen Ireland/ Fís Éireann.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Individuals on the political right are more vulnerable to conspiracy theories than those on the left, according to a new study. Aspernäs found that while the political left and right are equally prone to certain kinds of flawed reasoning, those on the political right are more susceptible to conspiracy theories. However, her analysis also revealed that almost everyone, regardless of ideology, tends to accept political claims that align with their own beliefs. In a series of specifically designed tests, they looked at three major categories of misinformation: logical fallacies, conspiracy theories and pseudo-profound nonsense. In examining logical fallacies, participants were presented with a series of politically charged syllogisms—logical statements requiring deduction. Some of these statements leaned left, others right. The researchers found that when a syllogism spoke to an individual's ideological concerns, whether left or right-leaning, they always demonstrated a similar impairment in reasoning and made logical errors regardless of their political alignment. Explaining this response, Aspernäs said in a statement that “we simply become worse at evaluating information in areas that matter to us, where it affects our self-image.” When it came to looking at conspiracy theories, participants were tasked with looking at a series of statements claiming there were covert plots behind major societal events. The results highlighted how those identifying themselves as right-leaning are more likely to accept conspiracy theories than left-leaning individuals. Researchers then gauged participants' openness to “pseudo-profound nonsense—abstract, seemingly meaningful statements devoid of real substance." Here no significant ideological difference emerged with both groups being equally susceptible. Reflecting on the findings, Aspernäs offered up several hypotheses as to why the political right seems more inclined to fall for conspiracy theories. She believes that right-wing communities may circulate a disproportionate number of conspiracy theories, therefore increasing individual exposure and normalising acceptance. Aspernäs also noted that conservative thinkers often adopt a precautionary, threat-focused worldview that may make them more receptive to conspiratorial explanations involving malevolent forces. She added that a tendency toward anti-democratic sentiments—which stretch across the ideological spectrum—might too facilitate openness to conspiracy theories. Despite her findings, Aspernäs stressed that the overall correlation was weak. “I don't know whether it helps us move forward, for example in public debate, by singling out certain groups,” she said. “The correlations we see, where right-leaning people stand out, are not very strong.” Ultimately, Aspernäs believes further exploration is required in order to better clarify causation and find out whether the right-wing predisposition is fundamental, or a byproduct of social environment and psychological traits. While conservatives were often reported to have stronger conspiracy beliefs, the strength and direction of this link varied across different theories and national settings. Do you have a question about conspiracy theories? Are Republicans and Conservatives More Likely to Believe Conspiracy Theories?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Age of Disclosure was granted a Capitol Hill screening and has broken digital rental records but does it really offer proof of alien life? It has been hailed as a game changer in public attitudes towards UFOs, ending a culture of silence around claims once dismissed as the preserve of conspiracy theorists and crackpots. It broke the record for highest-grossing documentary on Amazon's Prime Video within 48 hours of its release, Deadline reported this week. But not everyone is impressed by the film's claims that UFOs – now called UAPs (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) – are real and that governments have been hiding evidence for decades. Several sceptics have gone online to push back at The Age of Disclosure, contending that it has been over-hyped and fails to present new or compelling evidence. In their telling, the documentary has slick production values but rehashes familiar, decades-old grainy infrared videos and anecdotal pilot testimonies insufficient to support extraordinary claims of alien technology. Michael Shermer, the founding publisher of Skeptic magazine, says by phone from Santa Barbara, California: “All we have are blurry photographs, grainy videos and anecdotes from people that say they know somebody who knows something, or they know somebody who said they saw the spaceship, touched the aliens or worked on back engineering the spaceships and so on. ‘No, but here's this grainy video of this blob that was taken from a navy pilot 14 years ago off the coast of San Diego. Shermer, who for 30 years taught college and university courses in critical thinking and has written books including Why People Believe Weird Things, adds: “From a scientific point of view, none of this is valuable other than well, there might be something interesting here, let's go find out. It features interviews with 34 individuals from US government, military and intelligence backgrounds. Their presence has been seen as giving the film heft and helping reduce the stigma long felt by alleged UAP witnesses. He did not attack the documentary or seek to disown his remarks – but he did seek to add some context. “First of all, I'm not disavowing that,” Rubio said. Sceptics argue that UAP sightings are better explained by a combination of misidentification of mundane objects (balloons, satellites, drones), perceptual errors in low-information environments, secret terrestrial technologies and misunderstood optical and sensor phenomena. Jason Colavito, author of The Cult of Alien Gods: HP Lovecraft and Extraterrestrial Pop Culture, comments: “While I can't possibly give a single explanation for UFOs, or categorically say that no UFO has ever been an alien spaceship, every UFO that has ever been identified has turned out to be a prosaic – either natural or human made – object, and there's no reason to suspect that any of the objects seen in that movie are anything but that.” Colavito was left cold by The Age of Disclosure. “I found the film to basically be an Ancient Aliens episode with better lighting,” he says. “It was a rehash of material that has been used many times before. I thought that it was old stuff in a slick new package. “The only surprising thing was that they actually went into some of the more extreme and ridiculous pseudoscientific claims they make about how we can't photograph UFOs clearly because they're in a space time quantum bubble that distorts all the light around them so we can't see them. Colavito notes that the film has had an extensive and expensive publicity campaign including a Hollywood-style premiere. He sees it as part of a sophisticated media campaign aimed at securing government funding for defence contractors and associated thinktanks. “One of the things that surprised me is how much of the film seemed to be an advertisement for investing in UFO-themed energy research. “Luis Elizondo [an author and UAP disclosure activist who also serves as an executive producer on the film], for example, works for a defence contracting company, or at least did until recently, and many of the others also have current or former ties to defence contractors and other businesses and entities that make money from government contracts and government investment.” “This was the kind of thing that has a big publicity campaign leading up to it but then, once people begin to see the actual product, interest falls off rapidly because there is nothing new and nothing convincing in the film. There are a lot of stories but very few facts.” Joshua Semeter, director of Boston University's Center for Space Physics, has only seen the trailer for The Age of Disclosure and was unimpressed. “There's a lot of money to be made by keeping things in the spooky category. Semeter, who served on a Nasa team studying the origin of UAPs, believes that the film is unlikely to create a lasting cultural shift or mainstream acceptance of its claims. This production was an effort to grab the last little bits as we head out of the current UAP bubble.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It sounds like the plot of a sci-fi thriller, but a former Russian president insists it is his real life story. Kirsan Ilyumzinov has publicly claimed that he was taken aboard an alien spacecraft while he was still in office, and that some of the most powerful leaders on Earth were aware of similar encounters but stayed silent. According to Ilyumzinov, the extraordinary event took place in September 1997 while he was president of the Russian republic of Kalmykia. He recalled returning to his Moscow apartment after work, switching on the television, and preparing to sleep. From his open window, he claimed to see a glowing, translucent tube forming in the air. 'There was something like a translucent pipe glowing, made of some matter,' he said. Inside, he claimed to see beings who looked strikingly similar to humans, dressed in yellow garments, communicating not with speech but through thoughts. He said the air initially felt thin until one of the beings gestured for him to press on his chest, after which breathing became easy. I was not nervous,' he said, adding that the space smelled faintly like the sea or a forest. He claimed the beings showed him parts of the ship, including large window like openings through which he could see what looked like a fiery planet giving off heat. Comparing humans to ants, the beings allegedly told him that civilisations exist at different levels of development, and that Earth was still too violent and destructive to engage openly with others. He insists there were witnesses to his sudden disappearance. His chief of staff later confirmed that when colleagues arrived at his apartment the next morning to take him to the airport, he was nowhere to be found. Phones, clothes and slippers were still in place. Then, after more than an hour of confusion and even a call to the police, Ilyumzinov allegedly walked calmly out of the bedroom. 'He laughed and said, well, aliens took me,' his longtime aide recalled. Ilyumzinov himself said he was surprised by how normal he felt afterwards, suggesting the beings may have influenced his mental state to prevent panic or trauma. The former president went even further, alleging that knowledge of extraterrestrial contact is quietly shared among global elites. He said he discussed UFOs with figures such as Mikhail Gorbachev and Henry Kissinger, and claimed that US and Soviet officials once exchanged information on the subject. Most explosively, Ilyumzinov claimed that another sitting president of a major nation privately confided in him about a similar alien encounter during a fishing trip, but refused to go public for fear of political ruin. He suggested leaders like Putin, Trump and Xi Jinping are likely aware of UFO programmes and extraterrestrial presence, but choose silence to avoid public panic and ridicule. Whether seen as a sincere belief, a mystical experience, or an extraordinary claim demanding extraordinary proof, Ilyumzinov's story has reignited debate about UFOs and what the world's most powerful figures may really know. When a former head of state says he was taken by aliens while in office, people are bound to listen.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new effort with the U.N. and NASA aims to better chart these visitors using 3I/ATLAS. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. As the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS prepares for its closest approach to Earth on Dec. 19, it's being monitored not just by space agencies but also the United Nations. The comet, which will come within roughly 167 million miles (270 million kilometers) of our planet, will be tracked by telescopes around the world so astronomers can pinpoint its location and make predictions about future objects like it. The U.N.'s International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) is about halfway through its 3I/ATLAS observing campaign and expects to publish its findings in a peer-reviewed journal next year, James Bauer, a small-bodies node principal investigator at IAWN and a research professor in the University of Maryland's astronomy department, told Live Science. The network consists of more than 80 observatories and citizen scientists around the world doing active research on near-Earth objects, such as comets and asteroids. "The idea behind these campaigns is really to strengthen the technical capabilities for measuring sky positions, which we call astrometry, for asteroids and comets," Bauer said of IAWN's work. The investigators will be testing a new astrometry technique to track the pathway for 3I/ATLAS, which can be helpful for determining how to send a spacecraft to a similar comet in the future. (Bauer also serves as principal investigator for the NASA Planetary Data System's small bodies node, which archives, catalogs and distributes scientific data related to comets, asteroids and interplanetary dust.) IAWN had been planning an observing campaign like this since October 2024, so 3I/ATLAS was a late-but-fortuitous arrival when it was first spotted in late June. The interstellar comet's upcoming close approach coincides well with the team's planned observing schedule, and because 3I/ATLAS was visible in the network's observatories and of high interest, it seemed like a great fit, Bauer said.

For example, it includes components like water and carbon dioxide that are behaving similarly to normal solar system comets. —Mars orbiter narrows down the exact path of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS by 'ten-fold,' surprising scientists —New NASA, ESA images show 3I/ATLAS getting active ahead of its close encounter with Earth Citizen scientists, observatories large and small, and scientific organizations formed a record 171 campaign participants at the kickoff of IAWN's 3I/ATLAS campaign meeting in October. The mid-campaign teleconference, held Dec. 9 and days before Bauer's interview with Live Science, had 100 campaign participants. He said he's grateful for the community's time and interest, as it is helping astronomers refine their ability to report the positions of objects in the sky — including "vigilance" for other near-Earth asteroids and objects that come much closer to our planet. Elizabeth's reporting includes multiple exclusives with the White House, speaking several times with the International Space Station, witnessing five human spaceflight launches on two continents, flying parabolic, working inside a spacesuit, and participating in a simulated Mars mission.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Erika Kirk said she and Candace Owens will meet Monday, days after Charlie Kirk's widow joined a CBS town hall and said she wanted Owens to stop peddling conspiracy theories about her late husband's assassination. Kirk said on X that she and Owens would have a "private, in-person meeting" Monday. She added that they "agreed that public discussions, livestreams, and tweets are on hold until after this meeting" and that she's looking forward to a "productive discussion." Owens wrote on X that she's "very much looking forward to this discussion." Erika Kirk sat down with CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss last week for a town hall that aired Saturday on CBS. Weiss asked Erika Kirk what she would want to say to Owens, who has been amplifying conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk's assassination. Owens, a onetime friend of Charlie Kirk's and a former employee of his conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA, previously compared their relationship to that of a "brother and sister." The day after his assassination, she posted a lengthy video, saying she wanted him to be remembered for his career and ideas. In the months since, Owens has pushed conspiracy theories about his murder and made unfounded fraud allegations about the finances at Turning Point, which Erika Kirk now runs.
