                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing—and quietly advancing—challenges facing modern medicine. Among the most dangerous bacterial pathogens driving this crisis is Klebsiella pneumoniae, a microorganism capable of causing severe infections while evading both antibiotics and the human immune system. Now, a research team led by Prof. Dr. Füsun Can at Koç University School of Medicine has developed a novel diagnostic approach that enables the rapid and simultaneous detection of both antibiotic resistance and high virulence in Klebsiella pneumoniae. In recent years, especially concerning strains have emerged that combine multidrug resistance with hypervirulence, making infections both harder to treat and more severe. Until now, these features could only be assessed separately, often through time-consuming procedures that delayed effective treatment. The ability to capture this critical information simultaneously represents a significant advance in molecular diagnostics. Unlike viral outbreaks, bacterial resistance does not erupt suddenly—but its cumulative impact is profound. Delayed or inappropriate antibiotic treatment increases mortality risk, prolongs hospital stays, and accelerates the spread of resistant strains. Rapid, accurate diagnosis is therefore central to effective clinical decision-making. By enabling clinicians to identify the most dangerous Klebsiella strains at an early stage, this new approach supports timely, targeted therapy and strengthens infection-control strategies in healthcare settings. The Nature MDx Impact Award is presented to research that not only advances diagnostic science but also addresses urgent clinical needs. In its evaluation, Nature highlighted the project's originality, translational relevance, and potential for broad implementation. The project is supported by international industry collaboration, further strengthening its pathway toward clinical application. Beyond diagnostics, Prof. Dr. Can's research program aims to unravel how Klebsiella pneumoniae evades the immune system—a key step toward developing next-generation treatment strategies. Understanding these mechanisms could enable the design of novel therapeutic molecules, potentially supported by artificial intelligence-driven drug discovery.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the future, scientists could use drugs made from cannabis to fight ovarian cancer. A team of scientists testing the effects of two chemical compounds sourced from cannabis on ovarian cancer cells have found that both show promising anti-cancer effects. "Ovarian cancer remains one of the deadliest gynecological malignancies, characterized by late diagnosis, high recurrence rates, and limited effective treatment options," said Dr. Siyao Tong of Khon Kaen University, lead author of the article in Frontiers in Pharmacology. "Our goal is to find alternative drugs that can improve efficacy and potentially reduce toxicity, ultimately bringing new hope to patients facing this challenging disease." Of all the gynecological cancers, ovarian cancer kills most patients. Although there have been advances in treatment strategies, available drugs are not always effective and come with formidable side effects. Since CBD (cannabidiol, which is not psychoactive) and THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, which is) have shown potential against other cancers, the research team decided to test them against ovarian cancer cells. They took two different lines of ovarian cancer cells, one of which is sensitive to platinum-derived drugs and one of which is resistant, and challenged the lines with CBD, THC, or both, to see if the cells could survive and reproduce after exposure. They found that cells for both cancer lines which had been treated with CBD or THC formed fewer and smaller colonies of cells. Though both compounds worked to prevent cancer cells reproducing, combining them gave particularly good results. And although neither compound alone killed a large proportion of cancer cells, a combination of the two was very successful. It's possible that THC and CBD act on the cancer cells in different ways, and when used together, their effects are amplified. Notably, the inhibitory effect was most pronounced when CBD and THC were used in a 1:1 ratio." Additional assays showed that the compounds prevented cells from migrating, which means they might be able to stop ovarian cancer spreading to other parts of the body. Many patients die of metastases, so a treatment which prevents metastasis could save lives. Both cell lines were similarly affected, suggesting that the compounds could work equally well for different types of ovarian cancer. The compounds and their combinations also had minimal effects on healthy cells, which suggests that patients might find treatments made from them less toxic and easier to tolerate than current drugs. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is overactivated in ovarian cancer cells, which contributes to tumor development and treatment resistance. The scientists call for further research which can establish if and how these compounds can be used as effective new ovarian cancer therapies. "Although our study is still preliminary, it lays an important foundation for future research into the potential applications of CBD and THC in ovarian cancer treatment," said Tong. "By confirming their anti-cancer activity and identifying key molecular mechanisms, our findings are expected to drive further preclinical research. If future studies confirm these effects, CBD-THC combination therapy may ultimately contribute to the development of new treatment strategies." "All experiments were conducted in vitro, so the results may not fully reflect the complexity of tumor behavior in living organisms. We did not include in vivo models and pharmacokinetic data, which are crucial for determining whether CBD/THC can be safely and effectively used clinically. Finally, regulatory and legal issues surrounding cannabinoid therapy may also affect future translational research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research shows that 1 in 4 children with major traumatic injury do not receive care in a pediatric trauma center, where outcomes are generally better than in adult centers. The authors of the study, published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.250625, recommend evidence-based strategies to improve care for this vulnerable age group. "Given the strong evidence of improved clinical outcomes associated with care in pediatric trauma centers, access to these centers in Canada must be improved urgently," writes Dr. Lynne Moore, professor, Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, Quebec, with coauthors. "Since most severely injured children first present to nonpediatric hospitals, the most effective strategies lie in strengthening decision support in prehospital environments and nonpediatric hospitals, not in costly new infrastructure." Researchers found that in a study across 9 Canadian provinces over 5 years (2016 to 2021), 3007 children were admitted to an acute care hospital with major traumatic injuries. Of these, 2335 (77%) were directly transported (879, 29%) or transferred (1456, 48%) to a pediatric trauma center. A standardized prehospital triage tool adapted to pediatric patients, pediatric readiness assessments for nonpediatric hospitals, and teleconsultation pathways between referring hospitals and pediatric centers are some strategies. "Immediate implementation of evidence-based strategies to improve care for children with major trauma, coupled with targeted research and national data coordination, would save lives and provide more equitable trauma care for children in Canada, regardless of where they live," the authors conclude.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dementia is a group of disorders that gradually impair memory, thinking and daily functioning. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, affects about 7.2 million Americans aged 65 and older in 2025. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), while rarer, is the second most common cause of early-onset dementia, often striking people in their 40s to 60s. Although both diseases damage the brain, they do so in distinct ways. Because their symptoms can overlap, it often leads to misdiagnosis. Distinguishing between them is not just a scientific challenge but a clinical necessity, as accurate diagnosis can profoundly affect treatment, care and quality of life. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a portable, non-invasive and affordable alternative by measuring brain activity with sensors across various frequency bands. However, signals are often noisy and vary between individuals, making analysis difficult. Even with machine learning applications to EEG data, results are inconsistent and differentiating AD from FTD remains difficult. It boosts EEG accuracy and interpretability by analyzing both frequency- and time-based brain activity patterns linked to each disease. These differences help explain why AD is typically easier to detect than FTD. The model achieved more than 90% accuracy in distinguishing individuals with dementia (AD or FTD) from cognitively normal participants. Their two-stage design – first detecting healthy individuals, then separating AD from FTD – achieved 84% accuracy, ranking among the best EEG-based methods so far. The model merges convolutional neural networks and attention-based LSTMs to detect both the type and severity of dementia from EEG data. Grad-CAM shows which brain signals influenced the model, helping clinicians understand its decisions. This approach offers a new view of how brain activity evolves and which regions and frequencies drive diagnosis – something traditional tools rarely capture. What makes our study novel is how we used deep learning to extract both spatial and temporal information from EEG signals. By doing this, we can detect subtle brainwave patterns linked to Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia that would otherwise go unnoticed. Our model doesn't just identify the disease – it also estimates how severe it is, offering a more complete picture of each patient's condition." The findings also revealed that AD tends to be more severe, impacting a wider range of brain areas and leading to lower cognitive scores, while FTD's effects are more localized to the frontal and temporal lobes. These insights align with previous neuroimaging studies but add new depth by showing how these patterns appear in EEG data – an inexpensive and noninvasive diagnostic tool. "This difference explains why Alzheimer's is often easier to detect. However, our work also shows that careful feature selection can significantly improve how well we distinguish FTD from Alzheimer's." Overall, the study shows that deep learning can streamline dementia diagnosis by combining detection and severity assessment in one system, cutting down on lengthy evaluations and giving clinicians real-time tools to track disease progression. With millions affected by Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia, breakthroughs like this open the door to earlier detection, more personalized care, and interventions that can truly improve lives."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Obesity-related cancers include thyroid, pancreatic, breast, kidney, colorectal, esophageal, liver, gallbladder, ovarian, gastric, and endometrial cancers, as well as the plasma cell cancer multiple myeloma and meningioma, which is a tumor that grows between the skull and spinal cord. Now, a new study published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine provides evidence suggesting that the currently popular glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist medications for weight loss, such as Wegovy and Zepbound, likely have little to no impact on a person's obesity-related cancer risk. For this study, researchers analyzed findings from 48 previously-conducted trials examining the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 drugs on people with type 2 diabetes, overweight, or obesity, involving a total of more than 94,000 participants. “GLP-1 receptor agonists are now being used by millions of people worldwide for diabetes and obesity, yet their long-term cancer safety has remained uncertain,” Cho-Han Chiang, MD, MMSc, clinician investigator in the Department of Medicine in Mount Auburn Hospital at Harvard Medical School in Massachusetts, and corresponding author of this study, told Medical News Today. Chiang said they chose to specifically study obesity-related cancers because these cancers are strongly influenced by excess adiposity, chronic inflammation, and metabolic dysregulation. “Obesity increases the risk of these malignancies — there are 13 types of cancer recognized as associated with obesity — and GLP-1 receptor agonists produce meaningful and sustained weight loss,” he continued. “However, these are data from non-randomized studies with [the] possibility of confounding factors at play,” Chiang noted. “Our study pulls together cancer events across large randomized clinical trials to provide a more rigorous and comprehensive assessment of cancer risk with GLP-1RAs,“ he told us. “It helps fill a critical gap for clinicians, regulators, and patients who must balance substantial metabolic and cardiovascular benefits against theoretical long-term cancer risks.” At the study's conclusion, researchers determined that GLP-1 drugs probably had little to no impact on the risk for thyroid, pancreatic, breast, or kidney cancers. “The significance of this finding is that it directly addresses several long-standing safety concerns,” Chiang said. “At the same time, it is important to emphasize that trial follow-up is still relatively short for cancers that develop over many years,” Chiang continued. “Our results suggest that current GLP-1RA use does not appear to meaningfully increase short- to intermediate-term risk, but they do not rule out the possibility of effects, harmful or beneficial, over longer durations. “The significance of these findings is that they highlight areas where current evidence is simply too limited to draw firm conclusions, even across large randomized trials,” Chiang explained. As this study shows that GLP-1 medications probably have little or no effect on obesity-related cancer risk, MNT asked Chiang if it is possible that these drugs may offer a protective effect against these cancers. “Based on our analysis of randomized trials, GLP-1 medications probably have little or no effect on obesity-related cancer risk within the follow-up periods studied,” he responded. “However, this does not rule out the possibility of a protective effect over longer durations. In fact, there are several reasons why a protective effect has been hypothesized.” “GLP-1 receptor agonists produce substantial weight loss and improve metabolic health, which could theoretically reduce the incidence of obesity-related cancers over time. Second, several recent observational studies have reported lower rates of certain cancers among GLP-1RA users,” he explained. “Because randomized trials to date have relatively short follow-up and few cancer events, they may not yet capture long-term or delayed protective effects,” Chiang continued. MNT had the opportunity to speak with Anton Bilchik, MD, PhD, surgical oncologist, chief of medicine, and director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Providence Saint John's Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA, about this study. “The other issue with the study is that cancer was not a primary endpoint of the trials that they looked at […] so that in itself is certainly an issue in how this data is interpreted,” Bilchik continued. “And finally, which I think is most important and a lot more research has to be done, is we do not know how long the people in these trials have been obese for. Suggesting that obesity-related cancers may start occurring earlier on, and then patients get these GLP-1 drugs that reduce weight, at which point the cancer cells have already started forming,” he told us. “Given the fact that we have this very effective way of treating what is an epidemic in this country, […] we need to know every possible aspect about these drugs, both the good and the bad,” noted Bilchik. MNT also spoke with Mir Ali, MD, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon, and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this research. People with obesity have an increased level of biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease in their blood, a new study has found.

Mauricio Wajngarten, MD, PhD, has disclosed no relevant financial relationships. It is generally accepted that patients who experience a first episode of unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) — meaning without reversible risk factors — should receive prolonged oral anticoagulation (OAC). A recent study compared the effects of continuing or stopping OAC treatment on clinical outcomes in patients with unprovoked VTE following an initial treatment period of at least 90 days. The study included adults diagnosed with VTE who started OAC treatment — either warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) — within 30 days of first hospital admission for unprovoked VTE without reversible risk factors. The cohort was matched 1:1 by propensity score, creating 30,554 matched pairs of patients who continued or stopped OAC treatment (mean age, 74 years; 57% women). After the initial OAC treatment period of at least 90 days, patients who stopped treatment had significantly lower rates of recurrent VTE, higher rates of major bleeding, lower mortality, and a greater net clinical benefit. The study concluded that continuing OAC therapy for at least 90 days was associated with a lower risk of recurrent VTE but a higher risk of major bleeding. An accompanying editorial points to ongoing uncertainties about how to identify patients with different risk profiles for bleeding and thromboembolic events. Such information would be invaluable for personalizing treatment plans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers in Sweden are testing whether a brain-healthy MIND diet can be realistically adopted by adults with obesity, laying the groundwork for future trials linking diet, gut health, and mental well-being. In a recent study protocol published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition, researchers described an ongoing investigation into whether a Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet is practical, acceptable, and feasible for adults with obesity. The results of this study will provide feasibility data and preliminary evidence to inform future trials examining links among diet, the gut microbiome, mental health, and obesity, thereby guiding strategies to promote physical and psychological well-being. The pathways linking these conditions remain unclear, but growing evidence suggests diet plays a meaningful role in both weight management and emotional well-being. In Sweden, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has steadily increased over the past two decades, particularly among young adults. More than half of Swedish adults are now above a healthy weight, with marked differences across sex, country of birth, and education levels. These trends underscore the need for preventive strategies that address both physical and mental health. Diet-induced weight loss has been associated with improved mood in people with obesity, but psychological benefits may also arise through diet–microbiota interactions. Dietary patterns shape the gut microbiome, which is involved in metabolic regulation and stress- and mood-related pathways. The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet prioritizes foods rich in antioxidants, fiber, and healthy fats that support cognitive and gut health. Rather than fully combining Mediterranean and DASH diets, the MIND diet selectively emphasizes components thought to benefit brain and metabolic health. If shown to be practical and acceptable, this pattern may support weight loss and mental well-being in Sweden. A total of 126 adults aged 25 to 50 years with obesity will be recruited from primary care clinics and the community in the Västra Götaland Region of Sweden. The sample size allows robust feasibility estimates while accounting for expected dropout. Participants must have a body mass index (BMI) of at least 30 kg/m², internet access, and willingness to complete all procedures. If recruitment is challenging, the BMI threshold may be lowered to 27 kg/m². Exclusion criteria include conditions or treatments that could interfere with dietary change, gut microbiota composition, or mental health outcomes, such as use of weight-loss medication, diabetes, or polycystic ovary syndrome. Participants will complete online questionnaires assessing demographics, lifestyle behaviors, psychosocial well-being, eating attitudes, gut symptoms, and dietary intake. Mental health outcomes are assessed using validated self-report instruments measuring anxiety, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress rather than clinical diagnoses. Adherence is measured using a simplified food checklist targeting key MIND diet components at baseline, week 6, and week 12. Intervention participants receive a structured MIND-diet meal plan emphasizing leafy greens, berries, olive oil, whole grains, legumes, nuts, poultry, and fish. Control participants receive standard dietary advice aligned with Swedish guidelines without targeted MIND components. After 12 weeks, participants complete qualitative interviews exploring acceptability, barriers, and suggestions for improvement. Samples are stored at home and deferred if there is a recent illness, fever, diarrhea, or antibiotic use that could affect results. Laboratory processing is randomized to reduce batch effects. Primary outcomes include adherence, retention, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes include changes in gut microbiota, anxiety, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, weight, fat mass, waist-to-hip ratio, and BMI. Analyses are exploratory and intended to inform future efficacy trials. This protocol evaluates whether a MIND-diet–based intervention can be realistically implemented in adults with obesity, a necessary step before scaling interventions targeting both physical and mental health. If feasible, this approach could inform personalized dietary strategies and public health policies promoting brain-healthy eating. By integrating diet quality, emotional well-being, and gut microbiota, the study aims to provide foundational evidence for future large-scale trials addressing multiple dimensions of obesity-related health.
