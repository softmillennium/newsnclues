                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) continued to lean aggressively into Bitcoin (BTC-USD), stepping up purchases for a second consecutive week as prices pulled back. Between Dec. 8 and Dec. 14, the company acquired $980.3 million worth of Bitcoin, its largest weekly purchase since July and the second straight week of adding more than 10,000 coins to its balance sheet, something it had not done since January. The move reinforces Strategy's positioning as a dedicated digital asset treasury company at a moment when volatility has returned to the crypto market. Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator. That funding approach has revived concerns among critics who argue repeated equity issuance could be dilutive and may be pressuring the premium the shares trade at versus the firm's roughly $59 billion Bitcoin holdings. Shares fell about 6.7% to $164.60 in New York trading, while Bitcoin declined around 1.8% to $86,885, leaving the cryptocurrency roughly 30% below its early October peak of just over $126,000. Attention has also shifted to index dynamics. After speculation about a potential removal, the Nasdaq 100 decided late Friday to keep Strategy in the index following its annual reconstitution, easing fears of near-term forced selling. Separately, the company has urged MSCI to abandon a proposal that could remove digital asset treasury firms whose crypto holdings exceed half of total assets from global equity benchmarks, warning of potentially harmful consequences if adopted. MSCI is expected to announce its decision by Jan. 15, a date that could be closely watched as Strategy's shares continue to trade at a premium of about 1.1 times enterprise value.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AureaVault Trading Services Inc., a United States-based financial technology firm, today confirmed the expansion of its secure digital asset trading infrastructure to serve international markets, with a strategic focus on Mexico and Latin America. This move provides traders in high-growth emerging economies direct access to a platform operating under strict U.S. federal compliance standards. As cryptocurrency adoption accelerates across Mexico—driven by high-volume remittance corridors and demand for inflation-resistant assets—investors increasingly seek alternatives to unregulated local entities. AureaVault addresses this market gap by offering a trading environment secured by FinCEN Money Services Business (MSB) authorization (Registration #31000309349610). This federal oversight ensures that AureaVault adheres to rigorous Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols, providing a “safe harbor” for international capital. AureaVault eliminates this concern through an institutional-grade security architecture. The platform secures 98% of user funds in air-gapped cold storage facilities. This physical isolation protects assets from online threats. Additionally, the system employs multi-signature technology and Hardware Security Modules (HSM) to prevent unauthorized access. Unlike exchanges that rely on “hot wallets” for liquidity, AureaVault prioritizes asset safety above aggressive expansion. Beyond security, AureaVault delivers the technical performance required by professional traders. The platform's proprietary matching engine handles millions of transactions per second with ultra-low latency. Deep Liquidity: Ensuring competitive spreads on major trading pairs. 24/7 Stability: A microservices architecture ensures high availability, even during periods of extreme market volatility common in the crypto sector. AureaVault Trading Services Inc. is registered as a Money Services Business (MSB) with the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). This registration authorizes the company to operate as a money transmitter and dealer in foreign exchange across all U.S. states and territories. The vast majority of assets (98%) reside in offline cold storage. User accounts require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and real-time threat detection systems monitor for suspicious activity 24/7. AureaVault accepts users from compliant international jurisdictions, including Mexico. Our platform is designed to bridge the gap between emerging markets and U.S. financial standards, offering a secure venue for cross-border digital asset participation. AureaVault Trading Services Inc. is a premier digital asset exchange dedicated to transparency, security, and regulatory compliance. Headquartered in the United States, the company provides a seamless interface for retail and institutional clients to trade cryptocurrencies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BitMine Immersion Technology (BMNR), the largest Ethereum treasury company, continued its splurge, buying 102,259 in ether ETH$3,125.57 through last week, worth roughly $320 million at recent prices. The company kept its cash holdings steady at $1 billion, while its total holdings — including a minor bitcoin BTC$85,780.72 stack and stake in Worldcoin-focused digital asset treasury Eightco (ORBS) — stood at $13.2 billion. There's only a few exceptions such as BitMine and bitcoin-centric Strategy (MSTR) that kept adding to their holdings through the correction. However, BitMine is estimated to sitting on around $3 billion in unrealized losses on its ETH holdings, as the second-largest cryptocurrency is trading 36% lower than its August record-high. "2025 saw many positive developments in digital assets," said chairman Thomas Lee, who's also the founder of analytics firm Fundstrat, "including positive legislation passed by the US Congress and favorable regulations, and by strengthening support from Wall Street." "These strengthen our conviction that the best days for crypto are ahead and why we continue to accumulate ETH towards our 'alchemy of 5%' target," he added.

JPMorgan is set to offer clients access to a tokenized money market fund as part of Wall Street's latest crypto push. The bank announced that its asset management arm will launch a tokenized money-market fund that will run on the ethereum blockchain. My OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY) will be supported by Kinexys Digital Assets, the bank's tokenization platform. MONY will hold short-term debt and issue daily interest payouts in the same way traditional money market funds do. The new fund, which The Wall Street Journal reported will be offered to wealthy clients and institutions, will have a minimum investment of $1 million. It's also the latest crypto push from Wall Street broadly. JPMorgan analysts said recently that bitcoin could buck its latest downtrend and reach $170,000 in 2026. Asset tokenization has been in focus in 2025, with platforms like Robinhood framing it as a means of trading more efficiently or potentially gaining exposure to private investments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As BTC slips back under $90,000, Bitcoin's price has always relied on belief, not usage, and that ceiling is starting to show. Instead of trying to “upgrade” Bitcoin, Hyper builds around it. Execution lives in a high-speed environment, and applications finally get room to breathe. That's why investors are stacking HYPER, the token designed to sit at the center of Bitcoin's transition from a static asset to a living economic network. Yet, the latest dip has revived a harder question. Is Bitcoin's store-of-value narrative still enough on its own to keep prices moving higher? That question is also starting to surface in traditional markets. Strategy has come under pressure as index providers consider whether its heavy Bitcoin exposure justifies its inclusion in major benchmarks, such as the MSCI indices. JPMorgan analysts have warned that exclusion could trigger billions of dollars in passive fund outflows. Indeed, scarcity on its own may no longer be enough to drive Bitcoin higher. The base layer was intentionally designed to be minimal, conservative, and difficult to alter, i.e., a neutral settlement network that prioritizes security and verifiability above all else. That design choice is precisely why Bitcoin has survived for more than a decade without compromise. That is, if Bitcoin must remain simple, then complex execution has to live elsewhere. Execution moves into a separate environment, while Bitcoin remains the final judge of truth. Bitcoin was created to be an incorruptible form of money that no government, company, or small group could change, debase, or control. That's why Bitcoin relies on something as brutally simple as SHA-256: a one-way cryptographic function that does nothing fancy, but does one thing impossibly well. As mentioned, Bitcoin's base layer was intentionally kept minimal and conservative from the start. Advanced functionality was never meant to sit on Bitcoin's base layer, and forcing it there would undermine the very qualities that make Bitcoin valuable. This is precisely the impetus for creating Bitcoin Hyper. It introduces an additional layer above Bitcoin where advanced functionality can live without altering the base chain. That execution layer runs on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), removing execution from Bitcoin's slow base layer and placing it in an environment designed for speed and scale. What this creates is beyond just “hybrid apps,” but a structural shift. BTC flows through DeFi, gaming, and real economic activity at Solana-level speed, while final settlement still snaps back to Bitcoin. This Bitcoin Hyper system is designed to do one thing that Bitcoin has never been able to do at scale: make BTC usable in everyday economic activity. When applications require BTC to function, demand no longer depends solely on speculation or macro narratives but ultimately becomes structural. But Bitcoin Hyper isn't just creating a new use case for BTC. It's also creating a second half of the economy that early Bitcoin believers once had access to. The execution layer needs fuel, and that role belongs to HYPER. That's why more than $29.5 million has already flowed into the presale, as investors are placing early bets on the infrastructure they think Bitcoin will ultimately need to move higher. At its current presale price of $0.013425, many believe HYPER reflects the development-stage risk, rather than the value of a live ecosystem. HYPER already appears in Best Wallet's Upcoming Tokens section, which makes it easy to buy, track, and claim once the token goes live.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It also holds 193 BTC worth around $17 million, and has $1 billion in cash. Crypto prices have stabilized in the past week, further evidence that crypto prices have begun to recover after the price shock of October 10th,” said BitMine Chairman Tom Lee, in a statement. BitMine's latest acquisition continues an aggressive string of purchases in which the firm has added to its position as the leading ETH treasury firm, amid wobbling ETH prices. In the firm's previous purchase, disclosed last week, it bought around $429 million of ETH—its largest acquisition since October. In other words, Lee and his firm think that Ethereum has already hit its lowest price point this year. Beyond buying ETH, the firm is also making progress on a bespoke staking solution called The Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN), which will allow it to earn yield on its holdings. In a recent video interview with Farokh Sarmad—president of Dastan, Decrypt's parent company—Lee noted that the firm could make as much as $400 million in staking revenue annually from its holdings. Shares of BMNR are down nearly 7% since the opening bell on Monday, recently changing hands at $32.48. Since hitting a yearly peak of $161 on June 30, BMNR shares have now dropped nearly 80%. ETH is down more than 2% in the last 24 hours, recently trading hands at $3,010. The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto market is also at risk of further downward pressure due to macro factors such as the impending Japan rate hike. In an X post, Crypto Wimar revealed that Wintermute has dumped 40% of its holdings over the last three weeks, which has contributed to the crash in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP prices. The crypto pundit further noted that the market maker is still dumping millions in BTC and ETH on Binance, which puts these coins at risk of further declines. The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP prices are also crashing as crypto market investors brace for a Japan interest rate hike by the BOJ at their December 19 meeting. A Japan rate hike impacts the crypto market as it puts the yen carry trade in focus, with investors moving to sell their assets before the yen strengthens and their debt becomes more expensive. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP prices have crashed after every Fed rate cut this year. This similar price action is playing out as the Fed lowered rates by 25 bps last week. These crypto assets had seen a notable rebound prior to the Fed rate decision last week, indicating that the cut was already priced in. Demand for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP also appears to be dwindling, even among institutional investors. Ethereum treasury company BitMine is also the only company that has continued to accumulate ETH at an impressive pace amid this market downturn. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has indicated that the Bitcoin price could still drop below $50,000, which also puts Ethereum and XRP at risk of crashing. He noted that this is not a structure that market investors will typically want to see in a bull market. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.

We sometimes use affiliate links in our content, when clicking on those we might receive a commission at no extra cost to you. Under the OCC's announcement, five companies received conditional approval to either establish or convert into national trust banks. Once the regulator's requirements are fully met, they will join roughly 60 other national trust banks already overseen by the OCC. While the decision doesn't turn these crypto companies into full-service banks, it does grant them a regulated foothold inside the U.S. banking system. They are not allowed to take deposits or issue loans, but they can custody assets, process payments, and provide fiduciary services under federal supervision. All five firms must still satisfy capital, governance, compliance, and risk-management conditions before becoming fully operational. The approval builds on a precedent set in 2021 , when Anchorage Digital became the first crypto-focused firm to receive a national trust charter. Crypto companies largely welcomed the OCC's move as a long-awaited step toward regulatory clarity. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse celebrated the approval  as a “massive step forward,” particularly for Ripple's dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, which now sits under both federal oversight from the OCC and state supervision from the New York Department of Financial Services. In a statement released Friday, the Bank Policy Institute warned that the decision raised unresolved questions about regulatory consistency and oversight. The OCC's decision applies to Ripple's trust bank entity, which will focus on custody, payments infrastructure, and supporting stablecoin operations such as RLUSD. XRP remains a separate asset, and its regulatory status is unchanged by the charter. That said, the move could still have a lasting impact on XRP. Ripple's deeper integration into the federal banking system may encourage more financial institutions to use its payments infrastructure, where XRP can function as a bridge asset for cross-border transfers. Any such shift would likely play out gradually, as part of broader institutional adoption rather than a short-term market catalyst. XRP showed little immediate reaction to the news and was trading around $1.99, below the closely watched $2 level, amid a wider crypto market pullback in mid-December. Taken together, the approvals underscore a broader shift in U.S. crypto policy—from enforcement-heavy oversight toward conditional inclusion. By allowing firms like Ripple, Circle, Fidelity Digital Assets, BitGo, and Paxos to operate as national trust banks, the OCC is signaling that crypto companies can be part of the financial system, provided they meet the same supervisory standards as other federally regulated institutions. For critics, it is a test case that could redefine the boundaries of banking regulation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the data breach, more than 500 former post office workers who were wrongfully convicted during the Horizon IT scandal had their names and personal information leaked. This course of action has sparked strong criticism from privacy groups and advocates for the victims. Data breaches occurring in top governmental agencies like the post office once again bring into question the strength and readiness of public agencies' cybersecurity protocols. Amidst increasing occurrences of data and data breaches, cybersecurity experts are calling for government and federal agencies to adopt more stringent IT security measures. They highlight how the leaking of sensitive information can cause years of damage, like falling victim to online fraud or exploitation. Examples of this have been seen in the online entertainment industry, where users' email addresses and passwords have been leaked, causing mass account takeovers. Video streaming platforms and social media have become popular online forms of entertainment. These platforms have inherent security flaws though, as passwords can easily be hacked. For this reason, many online users are turning to platforms that run on more secure blockchain networks, such online games that include top crypto casinos. Firstly, these platforms offer much more entertainment value, providing users with access to thousands of online casino games. Thanks to blockchain networks, these platforms offer provably fair games, faster and more secure transactions, and strong data protection. Two months passed by before the file was finally removed. The presence of the file online was eventually brought to attention by an external law firm rather than internal safeguards. ICO officials made it clear that the leak was preventable should proper publishing controls and data-handling procedures had been followed. A few major issues were pointed out by the ICO, mainly the lack of quality-assurance processes for online publication. In addition, the regulator pointed to minimal staff training and a lack of technical systems to detect or prevent the upload of sensitive data. Many of the workers whose information was leaked spent years trying to clear their names. They faced bankruptcy, damaged reputations, and in some cases, imprisonment. Under its regulatory framework for the public sector, the ICO can impose financial penalties of up to £1.09 million for serious breaches. In the case of this leak, the ICO felt that a public admonishment would suffice instead of issuing a fine. This decision received strong criticism and backlash, especially from privacy advocates. Privacy advocates and cybersecurity groups argue that a public reprimand does nothing to remedy the situation. Instead, they argue, it gives public agencies the impression that they can continue to get away with data breaches unscathed. They pointed out that data relating to exonerated individuals carries unique risks. In their criticism, they highlighted that a lack of fines or any tangible consequences minimises the harm caused and reduces the pressure on the Post Office to improve its internal processes and systems. More than 500 post office employees, many of whom were sub-postmasters, were wrongfully accused of theft, fraud, and false accounting. These accusations were made after the Horizon software, which had software bugs, generated financial shortfalls in branch accounts. In the worst cases, some were even imprisoned or died before their names could be cleared. Compensation and Mitigation Measures Taken by the Post Office These services included fraud monitoring, credit alerts, and dark-web surveillance. Again, these interim measures are aimed at helping the immediate victims of the data breach, but legal experts are still calling for more robust security systems and risk mitigation protocols to be put in place so that future breaches can be avoided.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rachel Reeves wants to protect consumers by bringing digital money and assets into the ‘regulatory perimeter' The Treasury is drawing up rules that will require crypto companies to meet a set of standards overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Ministers have sought to overhaul the crypto market, which has ballooned in popularity as a way of investing money and making payments. Cryptocurrencies have not been subject to the same regulation as traditional financial products such as stocks and shares, which means that in many cases consumers do not enjoy the same level of protection. The cryptocurrency market has suffered from turbulence amid growing investor fears about a potential artificial intelligence bubble. Banking industry data in October showed that the amount of money lost to investment scams by UK consumers had surged by 55% in a year, with fake cryptocurrency thought to top the list. Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, orchestrated a fraud in China between 2014 and 2017 that left 128,000 people out of pocket. The 45-year-old stored the proceeds in bitcoin but UK authorities made a breakthrough in the case when they raided a Hampstead mansion in 2018 and seized devices from Qian holding 61,000 bitcoins, worth more than £5bn at current prices. Qian pleaded guilty at Southwark crown court on Monday to acquiring and possessing cryptocurrency that was criminal property. Ministers are also drawing up plans to ban political donations made with cryptocurrency, amid concerns that it is difficult to determine their origin and ownership. Nigel Farage's Reform UK, which became the country's first party to accept contributions in digital currency this year, is believed to have received its first registrable donations in cryptocurrency this autumn.</p>
