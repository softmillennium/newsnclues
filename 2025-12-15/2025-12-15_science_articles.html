                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We may earn commission if you buy from a link. While the Cambrian Explosion kickstarted complex life in a major way some 530 million years, the true timeline of life on Earth is much longer. But a study from an international team of scientists pushes that timeline back even further to some 4.2 billion years ago, while also discovering some fascinating details about what life for LUCA might've been like. First, the team compared genes in living species and counted the mutations that have occurred since sharing a common ancestor with LUCA. “We have to use complex evolutionary models to reconcile the evolutionary history of genes with the genealogy of species.” Not satisfied with just learning its age, the team took things a step further and retraced the physiological characteristics of living species to understand what LUCA must've been like 4.2 billion years ago—and the results gave some surprising answers. The scientists estimate that while LUCA was a simple prokaryote, it likely had an immune system, meaning it was already fighting off primordial viruses. “It's clear that LUCA was exploiting and changing its environment, but it is unlikely to have lived alone,” University of Exeter's Tim Lenton, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “Its waste would have been food for other microbes, like methanogens, that would have helped to create a recycling ecosystem.” While LUCA is the oldest common ancestor we know of, scientists still don't understand how life evolved from its very origins to the early communities of which LUCA is a part. Further studies will need to dive deeper into this primordial history and uncover exactly how you, me, and every other living thing, came to be.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Because they rely on hosts for a majority of functions, viruses aren't considered alive. At first glance, creating a definition for “life” seems somewhat straightforward. Sentient animals all the way down to single-celled organisms capable of reproduction are welcome on the tree of life, but there are other organisms that challenge this understanding, like viruses. Because virus don't grow, reproduce on their own, or make their own energy, they're typically excluded from definitions of life. But once a virus infects a potential host, it's immensely active, and can be responsible for world-altering events (see: Spanish flu, ebola, COVID-19, and so on). In a paper published on the bioRxiv server, researchers in Canada and Japan outlined how they identified a new cellular entity that appeared to challenge aspects of the typical definitions of cellular life. Currently named ‘Sukunaarchaeum mirabile' (after a deity in Japanese mythology known for its small stature), this entity—which the research team has concluded is a form of life—contains the necessary genes to create its own ribosomes and messenger RNA, something your typical virus lacks. But like a virus, it offloads certain biological functions onto its potential host and it appears singularly obsessed with replicating itself. “Its genome is profoundly stripped-down, lacking virtually all recognizable metabolic pathways, and primarily encoding the machinery for its replicative core: DNA replication, transcription, and translation,” the authors wrote. “This suggests an unprecedented level of metabolic dependence on a host, a condition that challenges the functional distinctions between minimal cellular life and viruses.” Within the genomic data, Harada and his team found a loop of DNA that didn't match with any known species. They eventually determined that the organism belonged to the domain Archaea—a group associated with prokaryotic cells, but from which eukaryotic cells (i.e. you and me) ultimately descended a couple billion years ago. Viruses, as Live Science points out, can contain many hundreds of thousands more base pairs, and can even reach up into the millions. As for fellow archaea, the smallest known complete genome within this group stretches to 490,000 base pairs, meaning that Sukunaarchaeum contains less than half the number of base pairs posessed by even the smallest archaeal genome.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While out on a stroll, the woman happened upon a roughly 900-year-old stash of more than 2,150 medieval silver coins known as denarii. “It was probably placed in its place during the first quarter of the 12th century, at a time of internal political instability,” he said. And the container certainly did it's job, even if the owner was never able to return for them—the coins weren't recovered for another 900 years. “But it was a huge amount, unimaginable for an ordinary person and at the same time unaffordable. It can be compared to winning a million in the jackpot.” The experts claim that a large collection of coins found in such a place could mean that they were originally meant to pay wages for soldiers, or were some sort of “war booty.” Early analysis of the haul shows both that the coins were minted in several places throughout the Kutnohorsk Region, and that they were likely created under the rule of three different Přemysl leaders (likely between 1085 and 1107): King Vratislav II and princes Břetislav II and Bořivoje II. The coins are made from an silver alloy that included copper, lead, and trace amounts of other metals. While we may never know the true intentions—or provenance—of the coin collection, experts still plan to puzzle out as much as possible. Mazačová said that museum staff will now register all the pieces of the collection, clean and restore the coins, and subject them to X-ray imaging and spectral analysis to determine their specific material composition.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A monumental staircase at Pompeii's House of Thiasus villa seemingly led nowhere. That nowhere turned into something special when researchers looked up. They've since determined that a “lost Pompeii” could once be found in now-destroyed towers rising above the ancient city's most elite villas. A research team employed digital archaeology to create models of villas of the super-rich, showing that Pompeii's largest villas likely once had towers, true symbols of power and wealth. The researchers from Berlin's Humboldt University and the Archaeological Park of Pompeii were most fascinated by the House of Thiasus, known for its banquet hall lined with frescoes. The villa, though, also features a monstrous staircase that seemingly leads nowhere. By scanning existing structures, the team designed digital replicas. Using clues, such as unconnected staircases and cut-off support beams, the team digitally designed architectural elements they believe previously existed. “This contrasted by the monumental external staircase that leads to the upper floor, suggesting a living space of a more elegant and representative character.” In an ancient city famous for what survived the horrific volcanic eruption, this digital approach demonstrates one way archaeologists can focus instead on what does not remain in the aftermath. “Archaeological research at Pompeii is extremely complex,” Zuchtriegal said. “As well as research carried out in the field with excavations that reveal well-preserved contexts providing insights into life in antiquity and new stories about the tragic eruption, another approach involves non-invasive research, based on studies and hypothetical reconstructions of what has not been preserved, but which adds to our knowledge of the site.” Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These Hummingbirds Joust Like Medieval Knights—Even to the Death The sharp, elongated bills of green hermit hummingbirds aren't just fine-tuned for feeding; they also allow males to joust like knights over mates The iridescent green hermit hummingbird is known for its elongated bill, which is fine-tuned for feasting on a particular tropical flower in the rainforests of Central and South America. But once mating season begins, its distinctive needle-pointed bill also becomes a weapon of war. According to new research published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, male green hermit hummingbirds use their bill—which is straighter and sharper than females'—to joust in a sparring match that can sometimes end in death. “We used to think that males and females had different bill curvature because they feed on different flowers, but now we see that the evolutionary purpose that shapes their beaks is also about fighting,” says lead study author Alejandro Rico-Guevara, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Washington.

Drug combinations are essential to modern medicine, but their discovery remains slow and inefficient as experimental complexity expands rapidly with each additional drug tested. Although modern liquid handling systems enable complex and highly customizable experimental designs, a lack of strategies integrating these technologies with combination-specific analytical methods has limited throughput. Here we introduce Combocat, an open-source and streamlined framework that combines acoustic liquid handling protocols with machine learning-based inference to achieve ultrahigh-throughput drug combination screening. Using Combocat, we generate a reference dataset of over 800 unique combinations in a dense 10 × 10 matrix format across multiple cell types, and use this to train a predictive model that accurately infers drug combination effects from sparse data, drastically reducing the number of experimental measurements required. As proof of concept, we screened 9,045 combinations in a neuroblastoma cell line—the largest number of combinations tested in a single cell line to date—achieved using minimal resources. By integrating advanced drug dispensing technologies with predictive computational modeling, Combocat provides a scalable solution to accelerate the discovery of novel drug combinations. The development of effective drug combinations is fundamental to modern therapeutic strategies1,2,3,4, particularly for cancers5,6 and infectious diseases2,7,8,9 where single-agent therapies often fail to achieve sustained efficacy. Combining drugs can have a synergistic effect on drug efficacy, overcoming resistance mechanisms and reducing the toxicity of treatment by requiring lower individual doses of each drug10,11. Synergy, in this context, is defined as a combination effect that exceeds expectations based on individual drug activities under established models like Bliss independence12 (Fig. a Practical representation of drug synergy, where the combined effect of two drugs exceeds the expected effect (“E”) based on models like additivity or Bliss independence. b Examples of traditional high-throughput screens employing small (e.g., 3 × 3), sparse, or asymmetric (e.g., 2 × 7) matrix formats, which limit dose density. c Combocat's streamlined approach for dense and reproducible drug combination screening. The 384-well plate format contains Drugs 1 and 2 (represented by upper and lower triangles, respectively), with concentrations shown ranging from low (blue) to high (red). Three replicate 10 × 10 combination matrices are generated for each drug pair, along with three replicates of each single-agent dose-response. Twelve replicates each of cell death (orange) and vehicle (yellow) controls are included for normalization. d Overview of the Combocat analytical pipeline. Raw data are mapped to corresponding combination matrices and subsequently normalized to percentage cell death using controls. Synergy is then quantified using the Bliss independence model. Results are summarized across the screen to identify top synergistic interactions. Combination therapy is a promising frontier—but also a vast one whose comprehensive exploration has been limited by the sheer number of possible drug combinations10. With each additional agent tested, the number of total possible 2-drug combinations increases quadratically, making exhaustive experimental testing impractical. While large-scale single-agent screens have evaluated tens of thousands of compounds13,14,15, drug combination screens have remained constrained by technical and resource limitations, preventing them from achieving comparable scale. These constraints often force researchers to choose between the number of combinations tested and the number of concentrations measured per drug, or dose density. This tradeoff can prove problematic, as dense measurements across a broad range of concentrations are crucial for capturing the nuanced dose-response landscapes needed to reliably detect synergy patterns16. Consequently, some of the largest reported combination studies have adopted smaller17, sparser18, or asymmetric19,20 matrix formats (Fig. Advancements in robotic liquid handling technologies, such as acoustic dispensing, have revolutionized compound transfer, enabling more flexible and precise experimental designs. Acoustic liquid handlers can dispense nanoliter volumes from any well of a source plate to any well of a destination plate without physical contact, enhancing throughput and minimizing resource consumption. Despite the promise of these technological advances, their impact on drug combination screening has so far been limited by a lack of integrated experimental and analytical platforms that fully leverage their capabilities. Here, we introduce Combocat, an open-source, end-to-end platform that integrates experimental and analytical workflows, underpinned by detailed protocols and documentation to enable reproducible, interpretable, and user-friendly drug combination screens. Combocat operates in two complementary modes, each facilitating fast and efficient combination screening. The “dense mode” measures all pairwise dose combinations in a dense 10 × 10 matrix format, tested in triplicate to ensure high fidelity and data quality. Using dense mode, we generated a comprehensive reference dataset of over 290,000 unique combination measurements (spanning 806 unique drug combinations) across diverse drugs and cell types. While this approach is ideal for high-quality data-rich screens, scaling dense mode to thousands of combinations is resource-intensive. To address this, we developed a machine learning-assisted “sparse mode”. Trained on the dense mode reference dataset, the predictive models in sparse mode enable ultrahigh-throughput screening with minimal resources. Notably, several other machine learning frameworks have been developed to predict synergy in different ways: TranSynergy21 leverages drug-target and gene-dependency features, SynToxProfiler22 computes integrated efficacy-toxicity-synergy surfaces, and comboFM23 uses tensor factorization to impute missing dose-response values. In contrast, Combocat's sparse mode measures only the 10 diagonal dose pairs and recovers the complete 10 × 10 response landscape via an ensemble of 90 per-pair regression models. As proof of concept, we used sparse mode to screen 9045 drug combinations in the neuroblastoma cell line CHP-134, representing the largest number of unique combinations tested in a single cell line to date. By integrating advanced liquid handling technologies with machine learning into an open-source and user-friendly platform, Combocat offers a scalable, efficient solution for accelerating the discovery of drug combinations. To address longstanding challenges in drug combination screens—such as limited dose density, poor interpretability, and operational complexity–we developed Combocat to integrate experimental and analytical workflows into a user-friendly framework. The “dense mode” workflow facilitates comprehensive, dense measurements by systematically evaluating all pairwise dose combinations in a 10 × 10 matrix format (Fig. A customized acoustic liquid handling protocol prepares each 384-well plate with two drugs at ten concentrations each, including three replicate 10 × 10 combination matrices, single-agent dose-response curves, and internal controls (for example, twelve replicates each of cell death and vehicle controls). This design ensures robust normalization and reproducibility while reducing the time and effort typically associated with high-throughput combination screens. Building on this experimental foundation, the analytical pipeline (Fig. 1d) maps raw data to their corresponding matrix positions, normalizes values to percentage cell death, and quantifies synergy using the Bliss independence model. Results are then filtered and ranked, enabling researchers to rapidly identify top-performing combinations and visualize complete synergy landscapes without extensive post-processing. By uniting dense measurements with a streamlined analytical workflow, Combocat's dense mode provides a high-fidelity framework for characterizing drug interactions in a reproducible and operationally straightforward manner. Applying dense mode, we generated a reference dataset of 806 drug combinations comprising over 290,000 individual measurements in the 10 × 10 matrix format (Supplementary Data 1). This dataset was designed to evaluate a diverse range of drugs and cell types, ensuring generalizability across multiple experimental contexts. Assay quality was high, as indicated by Z′ values (mean = 0.747; Supplementary Fig. a Distribution of single-agent standard deviations. The standard deviation is measured across each dose of all single-agent drugs across their respective three replicates. b Distribution of combination standard deviations. For each drug combination, the standard deviation is measured across all 100 dose pairs and their respective three replicates. c Mean adjusted Bliss synergy (Blissadj.) value across the 100 dose pairs per combination. d Dose-response curves for SMX (top) and TMP (bottom). Individual replicate values are represented by smaller gray dots. Horizontal dashed lines correspond to 50% cell death.

During analysis, we identified occasional spurious single-agent measurements, a common challenge in high-throughput screens24. These anomalies, often resulting from incomplete drug transfer or other technical issues, can distort synergy calculations by introducing outliers into the dataset (Supplementary Fig. To address this, we implemented a rigorous quality control (QC) pipeline that flags and adjusts anomalous data points using predefined thresholds for variability, dose-response residuals, and monotonicity (Supplementary Fig. Flagged values can be excluded from subsequent synergy calculations, yielding an “adjusted Bliss synergy” (Blissadj.) This QC approach ensures accurate synergy quantification by minimizing the impact of outliers. To evaluate the platform's capacity to identify and replicate known synergistic interactions, we first examined the top-ranked combination in our dataset: sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (TMP) in E. coli cells (Fig. This pair is a well-established example of synergistic drug behavior9, widely used to treat various bacterial infections25. Both SMX and TMP displayed sigmoidal dose-dependent relationships (Fig. 2d), and when combined, exhibited strong synergy (Fig. We further evaluated an additional known example of synergy included in our screen—the combination of AZD1390 and CX-5461—which has been reported as synergistic in Neuroblastoma cells26. The single-agent responses and strong synergy patterns (Fig. Collectively, these examples highlight Combocat's ability to faithfully reproduce known synergistic interactions and provide a framework for understanding complex combination landscapes. While dense mode offers high-quality, data-rich combination measurements, scaling it to thousands of combinations can become resource-intensive. To address this, we developed a “sparse mode” workflow, which minimizes direct experimental measurements while still capturing synergy information between drug pairs. The sparse mode assay is miniaturized into a 1536-well format and separates the single agents and combinations into their own plates (Supplementary Fig. Single-agent plates measure each drug across 10 doses, while combination plates only measure drug pairs at a relative 1:1 ratio—corresponding to the diagonal of a 10 × 10 matrix. Single-agent response values are mapped onto dose-response curves and integrated with combination data to assemble the sparse matrix (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d), which effectively cuts the required number of measurements by 90%. By dramatically decreasing the experimental resource consumption per combination, sparse mode increases throughput and efficiency. For example, the workflow supports up to 135 single agents, which yields 9045 combinations and would require just 73 plates when using six replicates of single-agent plates (Supplementary Fig. Consequently, sparse mode's miniaturized design and efficient plate usage make ultra-large-scale combination screens available with minimal resources. To enhance the utility of our sparse screening workflow, we developed an ensemble machine learning model capable of predicting the non-measured response values within a sparse matrix, effectively filling in the gaps to reconstruct the completed matrix. We leveraged the dense mode combination data to train the model, which provided fully-measured 10 × 10 matrices alongside their corresponding single-agent responses. From this, we curated a training set comprising 552 matrices (198,720 measurements) and a test set of 184 matrices (66,240 measurements) (Fig. Each non-measured index within the sparse matrix is predicted by a dedicated regression model within the ensemble, allowing all 90 models to be finely tuned for their respective targets (Fig. a Composition of training and test sets used to develop the ensemble model. The training set includes 552 fully-measured 10 × 10 combination matrices (light orange, 75% of total data), while the test set has 184 matrices (dark orange, 25% of total data). b Overview of the ensemble machine learning model architecture. Ninety individual models are each designed to predict the response of a single non-measured index of a sparse matrix. Fully-measured 10 × 10 matrices from the training set are downsampled to reflect the 30 measured values collected in sparse mode (treated as features) and the index a given model aims to predict (treated as the outcome variable). Each model undergoes hyperparameter tuning and is fit with the XGBoost regression model (see “Methods” section). e Comparison of observed versus predicted cell death response values for the model predicting index [1,2] across the test set. j Violin plot summarizing the Euclidean distances between the target index of a model and its corresponding feature index with the maximum importance value, across all 90 models. The dashed line represents the median Euclidean distance (d = 2) across all samples, with model [4,6] highlighted as an example (red dot). l Overall predictive performance of the model across all samples in the test set (n = 184). m Overview of the sparse mode workflow, integrating the experimental generation of sparse matrices with the machine learning-based imputation of non-measured response values. Analyzing variable importance (VI) revealed that predictions were most strongly influenced by measured values closest to the target index. For instance, the model predicting the response at row 1, column 2 (Model[1,2]), primarily relied on data from its two nearest measured indices (Fig. Despite relying heavily on only two of the 30 measured values, this model achieved strong predictive performance (r = 0.98) between the observed and predicted values in the test set (Fig. Similar patterns were observed throughout the ensemble, with strong performance across models predicting values near the diagonal (Fig. A broader analysis of all models confirmed a proximity-based dependency, with most predictions relying on measured indices within a Euclidean distance of 1 or 2 from the target index (Fig. These findings underscore the importance of leveraging local features for predicting sparse matrix values and highlight the advantage of training dedicated models for each of the 90 non-measured indices, enabling highly targeted predictions (Supplementary Data 2). To evaluate the ensemble's overall performance, we compared observed and predicted cell death responses across all non-measured indices in the test set. This yielded a strong correlation (r = 0.98, Supplementary Data 3) (Fig. 3l), demonstrating the ensemble's reliability in capturing key combination response effects. By predicting non-measured values, the ensemble model enriches the sparse screening workflow, providing detailed insights that enhance the interpretability of synergy results while preserving resource efficiency (Fig. To demonstrate the scalability and practical utility of Combocat, we applied the sparse mode workflow to screen 9045 drug combinations in the neuroblastoma cell line CHP-134 (Supplementary Data 4), representing the largest dense combination screen reported in a single cell line. We used 135 small molecules, encompassing approved chemotherapeutics, investigational compounds, and neuroblastoma-selective agents nominated from our earlier CRISPR screens27. Synergy was quantified for each pair by their mean Blissadj. (observed) score—the adjusted Bliss synergy averaged across the matrix diagonal (10 measured dose pairs) (Fig. Most combinations centered near zero (Fig. 4b), indicating a predominance of additive or non-synergistic interactions and aligning with prior findings that strong synergy is a rare phenomenon20,28,29. a Heatmap of the mean adjusted Bliss synergy scores (Blissadj.) across experimentally observed 10 dose pairs for each of the 9045 tested combinations.

The top 15 hits are labeled above. g–n Comparison of the top 2 hits from sparse mode (upper matrices) re-screened using dense mode (lower matrices). The cell death (g, h, k, l) and synergy (i, j, m, n) matrices are compared between the two modes. To prioritize drug combinations for further exploration, we used three filtering criteria that captured spatially coherent synergy patterns (Moran's I), data reliability (QC flag counts), and biological relevance (mean cell death response, Fig. After filtering, 594 top-scoring pairs remained, ranked by mean Blissadj. To validate these sparse mode predictions, we re-screened a subset of 40 combinations in dense mode: the top 30 from sparse mode (expected to display the highest synergy) plus 10 randomly selected combinations that had been excluded. Measuring these combinations in a fully sampled 10 × 10 format enabled a direct comparison to sparse mode results. Most top-ranked drug pairs retained strong synergy patterns, confirming that sparse mode can effectively prioritize synergistic combinations (Supplementary Fig. In contrast, the 10 random pairs exhibited weaker synergy in dense mode, matching their lower sparse mode scores. We additionally compared single-agent dose-response curves for the 47 unique drugs in the validation set and observed close alignment (rho = 0.858) of IC50 values and fitted dose-response curves (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c), reinforcing the consistency of single-agent measurements obtained in sparse mode. This aligns mechanistically with targeting complementary DNA damage repair pathways: PARP inhibition leads to accumulation of single-strand breaks, while ATM inhibition impairs the double-strand break repair response30. Re-testing these combinations in dense mode confirmed high agreement (Fig. 4h, j, l, n), meaning strong, reliable synergies could be identified from the starting set of over 9000 screened combinations. Collectively, these data establish Combocat's sparse mode as an efficient and scalable means of uncovering synergy even in ultra-large-scale screens. Combocat presents a step toward more comprehensive, flexible, and scalable drug combination screening. By uniting acoustic liquid handling and machine learning-assisted inference, we have demonstrated the feasibility of screening thousands of combinations while retaining the resolution and interpretability crucial to discovering strong synergistic interactions. The principles underpinning Combocat are broadly applicable, with a design that supports compatibility with various assay readouts that align with specified volumes and plate formats—such as luminescence, absorbance (Supplementary Fig. 6), fluorescence, mass spectrometry, or high-content imaging. Furthermore, the open-source acoustic liquid handler protocols ensure adaptability to other drug dispensing platforms with comparable capabilities, establishing Combocat as a scalable foundation for diverse experimental applications. The functionality and workflow of Combocat are designed to be straightforward, including its minimal and intuitive analytical pipeline (Supplementary Fig. This streamlined architecture, along with open-source and detailed documentation, ensures that researchers can easily implement and customize Combocat experiments according to their needs. Our goal is to pursue continual refinement and expansion of the platform. One of the most compelling aspects of Combocat lies in its potential for community-driven advancement. As more research groups generate dense combination data, these datasets can be anonymized and contributed back to the community for re-training and improving the ensemble machine learning model (Supplementary Fig. This communal effort could result in a dynamic resource capable of delivering progressively more accurate synergy estimates with minimal experimental overhead. While Combocat enables high-throughput combination screening in various contexts, some limitations are important to acknowledge. We tested three progressively stringent stratifications of our dense mode dataset (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c) and found essentially identical predictive performance (r≈0.97, Supplementary Fig. However, as new data are collaboratively added, preventing leakage through continuous hold-out testing will be essential to maintain the model's robustness and generalizability. Second, although dense and sparse modes' experimental measurements largely agree, they will differ in some circumstances. Sparse mode uses miniaturized volumes and a different plate format, which can occasionally introduce shifts in drug potency or dynamic range. This can be related to technical factors like compound dispersion in smaller volumes, plate layout effects, or variations in cell confluence in smaller wells. For example, Bliss can misestimate synergy for drugs targeting similar pathways, and Loewe cannot calculate synergy in the absence of dose-equivalence (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b)—making it undefined in 61.5% of sparse mode dose combinations tested (Supplementary Fig. We compared the mean synergy scores in our combinations passing QC and filtering steps (n = 800) and observed a modest agreement between the Bliss and Loewe models (Spearman rho = −0.672, p < 2.2e-16, Supplementary Fig. Importantly, additional reference models exist such as Highest Single Agent (HSA)31, Zero Interaction Potency (ZIP)32(which models changes in potency of the dose-response curves), and others, which can be evaluated in future extensions of the platform. We envision leveraging Combocat's scalability to investigate more of the vast unexplored drug combination space, mapping out the synergy landscapes of thousands of drug combinations across many cell lines (Supplementary Fig. By integrating sparse mode workflows with continuously evolving machine learning models, rich synergy datasets can be generated, capable of capturing complex biological responses. Such comprehensive synergy maps will empower researchers to identify conserved interactions, reveal lineage-specific vulnerabilities, and guide the rational selection of combination therapies. This study complied with all relevant ethical regulations. Mycoplasma was routinely tested using the MycoAlert mycoplasma detection kit (Lonza, catalog # LT07-118), and the cells were verified negative for contamination. For experiments with bacterial cultures, the Escherichia coli BW25113 strain (Horizon Discovery Ltd.) was cultured at 37 °C in Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar or broth (BBL). Compounds were sourced from commercial vendors (see Supplementary Data 5). Across all assays, compounds were screened at 10 concentrations using 3-fold serial dilutions, typically with an upper limit of 25 µM. Most compounds were screened below and above their physiologically-relevant doses, and in a way positioning their suspected IC50s as the midpoint to attempt achieving a complete dose-response effect. The choice of 135 compounds used in sparse mode comes from drugs targeting the top neuroblastoma-selective sensitizers from earlier CRISPR-anchor screens27. Specifically, drugs were chosen using the following approach: Our previous CRISPR knockout-anchor screens investigated 18 cell lines using 7 neuroblastoma standard-of-care drugs and 1 investigational compound (Doxorubicin, Etoposide, Retinoic Acid, Topotecan, Vincristine, Cisplatin, Phosphoramide Mustard, and JQAD1). The CRISPR knockout library was designed to target 655 known druggable genes. These screens were designed to identify druggable gene knockouts that sensitize cancer cells to standard-of-care neuroblastoma drugs. To identify these high-potential drug-sensitizing gene knockouts from the resulting dataset, we applied a custom Bayesian hierarchical model (described in the “Methods” section of Lee and Wright et al.) to nominate genes with differential sensitization effects in the Neuroblastoma group, relative to the outgroup cell. We then compiled the list of drugs that targeted the resulting neuroblastoma-selective sensitizing gene knockouts. For genes targetable by >1 drug, the list was reduced manually, considering factors such as clinical approval, redundancy with other drugs, number of analogs, and compound availability. Finally, we manually added high-priority investigational compounds to the list after consultation with multiple pediatric oncologists at St. Jude, yielding the final number of 135 unique drugs. The list of drugs is available in Supplementary Data 5. To enable comprehensive and reproducible measurement of pairwise dose combinations in a 10 × 10 matrix format, we designed a 384-well plate template that accommodates three replicate 10 × 10 combination matrices in a 384-well plate format, along with three replicates of the dose-response curves for each single-agent and twelve replicates of each positive and negative control (Fig. In each well, 200 nL of total compound was transferred via an Echo 655 acoustic liquid handler (Beckman Coulter): 100 nL of compound + 100 nL of DMSO for single-agent wells, or 100 nL of each compound for combination wells. This was followed by 40 μL of cells, added using a Multidrop combi (Thermo Fisher). Maintaining a 40 μL volume of cells minimized edge effects arising from evaporation. Each dense mode plate tested exactly one drug combination, making the total plate count for a dense mode experiment scale linearly with the number of drug pairs. Sparse mode was designed to increase throughput and reduce resource usage by miniaturizing the assay into a 1536-well plate format (Supplementary Fig. Three key features enable ultra-large combination screens in sparse mode: Edge wells are filled with culture medium to mitigate evaporation. Doses are interleaved to minimize well-to-well signal contamination. Measurement of the diagonal only: Each 10 × 10 matrix is represented by 10 dose pairs that combine each drug at a relative 1:1 ratio. For example, the 6th-highest tested dose of Drug 1 with the 6th-highest tested dose of Drug 2. This reduces the total measured dose pairs by 90%, compared to a fully-measured 10 × 10 matrix (Supplementary Fig. Separate single-agent and combination plates: Single-agent and combination plates are tested separately, with single-agents testing each drug's 10-dose series, and combinations testing only the diagonal dose pairs. This allows single agents to be mapped onto combination matrices without being re-measured. For example, to screen the combinations A_B and A_C, dense mode would measure A twice, whereas sparse mode would measure A once. Within-plate controls facilitate normalization before integration into assembled matrices. The total number of plates required for a sparse mode screen can be calculated as: where c is the total number of cell lines, r is the total number of single-agent plate replicates, and n is the number of unique drugs. For both dense and sparse modes, compounds were transferred into empty 384- or 1536-well plates (Corning) using the Echo 655 acoustic liquid handler with Combocat protocol files (available at combocat.stjude.org). After compound transfer, cells were dispensed at seeding densities of 1000 cells/well in 384-well plates or 200 cells/well in 1536-well plates. For E. coli cells (which were only screened in 384-well plates), an OD600 of 0.0005 was used. In 1536-well plates, cells were strained through a 70 µM cell strainer before being dispensed. The final DMSO concentration after cell addition was 0.5% in all wells. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. Cell viability was assessed after the 3-day treatment using CellTiter-Glo (or BacTiter-Glo for bacterial cells) by adding either 25 µL (to 384-well plates) or 2 µL (to 1536-well plates) of prepared reagent and reading luminescence on an EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer). The MTS reagent was incubated with cells for 3 h, and plates were read at 490 nanometers on a Cytation 5 plate reader (BioTek). The quality of all screened assay plates was assessed using the Z′ metric33, which measures quality as a function of signal window and data variation, given by: The Combocat ensemble machine learning model was developed as a collection of 90 individual models, each built to predict one of the 90 non-measured indices of a sparse matrix. To construct these models, an input dataset was first assembled containing all fully-measured data collected via dense mode, totaling over 800 combination matrices and their single-agent response values (Supplementary Data 1). The input dataset was first filtered to remove any matrices with a mean cell death value < 10%. This resulted in a training set of 552 matrices (198,720 measurements) and a test set of 184 matrices (66,240 measurements). This format was used for associating a model with its respective index. Each model was trained on 30 features: response values from 10 single-agent indices each from Drug 1 and Drug 2, and 10 indices corresponding to the matrix diagonal, which represent each drug's concentration combined at a relative 1:1 ratio (Supplementary Fig. These 30 features correspond to the 30 indices measured experimentally in the sparse mode workflow (Supplementary Fig. Hyperparameter tuning was enabled to optimize model performance, which was accomplished using a space-filling grid design to efficiently test 40 combinations of the hyperparameters (detailed in Supplementary Data 6). A 10-fold cross-validation was used to select the optimal set of hyperparameters based on the lowest R2 value. Once identified, each model was trained using its respective optimal hyperparameters on the entire training set. The performance of each model was evaluated across all folds, gauged by R2 and RMSE. For each model, the variable importance was measured across each of the 30 features (30 measured response values from sparse matrices) to evaluate their predictive impact (Supplementary Data 7). Next, the trained models were validated on their test sets to ensure their predictive capability by comparing the observed vs. predicted cell death response values. Finally, the ensemble model was serialized in a format that allows for rapid deployment for future sparse matrix predictions. All model generation was performed using the tidymodels framework (tidymodels.org). To ensure data integrity and mitigate the impact of spurious measurements, we implemented a rigorous quality control (QC) procedure focusing on three key metrics: single-agent standard deviation, residuals from single-agent dose-response curves, and monotonicity of the cell death response. For each single-agent drug, we first calculated the standard deviation of the percentage cell death (% cell death) values across all replicates at each dose level, resulting in ten standard deviation values per agent corresponding to the ten doses tested. Any dose with a percentage cell death standard deviation exceeding a predefined threshold (Tdefault) of 29 was flagged for disqualification. All combination data points involving that particular dose were also flagged for disqualification (Supplementary Fig. Next, we fitted a four-parameter log-logistic model to the dose-response data for each single-agent drug. Doses with residuals whose absolute value exceeded the Tdefault threshold of 15% were disqualified (Supplementary Fig. Finally, we assessed the monotonicity of the cell death response, under the assumption that percentage cell death should increase monotonically with increasing drug concentration. If any of these combination responses decreased by more than 16% compared to the previous dose pair, that specific combination value was disqualified (Supplementary Fig. After assessing a combination matrix using all three QC metrics, the flagged values were tracked and could be excluded from summary statistics if desired. For example, a combination matrix could be summarized by its mean Bliss synergy score (which averages over all 100 Bliss synergy values of the 10 × 10 matrix), or by its “adjusted” Bliss synergy score (which only averages over the non-disqualified Bliss synergy values). A pairwise combination screen of 135 drugs was performed in the CHP-134 cells. Each single-agent plate was replicated six times. Drug combinations were prioritized for further exploration by first applying a series of filtering criteria: Moran's I, a measure of spatial autocorrelation35, was used to assess the distribution of synergy across each 10 × 10 combination matrix. Moran's I quantifies the degree to which similar scores cluster together in space and was applied to all synergy matrices (Supplementary fig. A high Moran's I indicates that similar synergy scores are similarly clustered, forming cohesive patterns, whereas low values suggest a random distribution with no discernible pattern. We reasoned that synergy matrices exhibited such localized motifs likely reflect coherent biological effects, while sporadic patterns are more likely to signify noise or spurious results. All matrices with a Moran's I value of <0.6 were filtered out to retain only those with strong patterns of spatial autocorrelation. All combination matrices were subjected to a filter based on the quality of the measured values. If more than six of these ten measured values were flagged by the QC pipeline as unreliable, the matrices were excluded. The mean percentage cell death was also used as a filter for the screening data. For all 100 dose pairs per combination, the mean was calculated, and only matrices with ≥20% cell death were retained for further analysis. This ensured that the high-ranking synergy was also meaningful in terms of inducing cell death. This metric is simply the mean of the 10 measured values per combination after they were subjected to QC (Fig. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Geoscientist Mengran Du and her team reported the deepest ecosystem known to host animals this year.Credit: Billy H.C. Kwok for Nature That is how many researchers in the United States, at least, will remember 2025. Throughout the world, financial pressures, political interference and rising nationalist sentiment have put increased strain on a scientific enterprise that thrives on independence, openness and diversity, as Nature's special series on the future of universities has reported over the past few months. Some stood up for scientific values, such as Susan Monarez, who was fired after a brief tenure as head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, during which time she was asked to pre-approve vaccine recommendations without considering the relevant data. Negotiations leader Precious Matsoso, a former director-general of South Africa's health department, describes the gruelling process, and how persistence, humour and a constructive approach paid off.

There is still much about our planet that we don't understand, but a thriving global enterprise of science can uncover its mysteries. Among them is entrepreneur Liang Wenfeng in Hangzhou, China, whose company created the country's home-grown artificial-intelligence model DeepSeek-R1. Entomologist Luciano Moreira established a company in Curitiba, Brazil, that infects Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with a bacterium called Wolbachia, curbing the insects' ability to transmit human pathogens. Besides being at the cutting edge of their fields, Moreira and Merbl share something else: they both studied in the United States before returning home. That network now seems at risk as an immigration crackdown makes it more difficult, more expensive and less attractive for researchers globally to study and work not just in the United States, but in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, too.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Back pain affects many people, yet a surprising number of misunderstandings continue to circulate. Meghan Murphy, M.D., a neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato, reviews eight common beliefs and explains what research and clinical experience actually show. Myth: Lifting heavy objects is the main cause of back pain. Fact: Lifting heavy objects with poor form can contribute to back pain, but the major culprits are a sedentary lifestyle, poor posture, obesity and genetic factors. Myth: Bed rest will make my back pain better. Fact: Probably not, but it depends on the cause of your pain. However, bed rest can also make back pain last longer or even worsen. If your pain is from nerve compression, a disc issue or joint degeneration, inactivity can cause muscles to tighten, pain to worsen, loss of physical condition and more debility. In these cases, you should modify your activities, switch to low-impact exercises like walking and swimming, and avoid movements like bending, twisting or lifting. Maintaining some degree of physical activity can help you heal faster. Myth: Back pain is caused by sitting on a fat wallet. Fact: Sitting with a large wallet in your back pocket can cause leg or hip pain and numbness, but typically not back pain. After sitting for a long time, you may find walking difficult or feel pins and needles in your legs. First, try removing the wallet and taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications. If the leg pain persists, check with a healthcare professional. Myth: Back pain is always due to a serious underlying condition. Fact: Back pain is usually caused by muscle strains or sprains, not by a serious condition like a disc or vertebrae issue. If something isn't getting better or grows progressively worse, contact a healthcare professional for an evaluation. Myth: Surgery is the only solution for chronic back pain. Fact: Back pain is often caused by issues that aren't relieved with surgery. Seek an immediate medical evaluation if you experience any of these symptoms. Myth: A firm mattress is the best for alleviating back pain. Myth: Poor posture doesn't contribute to back pain. Fact: Many people spend hours slouching while staring at a computer or focusing on cellphones that draw the eyes down and curve the neck. These habits can strain muscles and joints, causing body pain over time. Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For many people living with long COVID, ongoing issues such as breathlessness, fatigue and brain fog remain difficult to explain. A team of prominent microbiologists now believes they may have uncovered an important clue. A review published in eLife by 17 experts, including researchers at Rutgers Health, suggests that co-infections acquired before or during a bout of COVID may help drive long-lasting symptoms. "This is an aspect of long COVID that is not talked about a lot," said Maria Laura Gennaro, a microbiologist at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School who chaired the Microbiology Task Force for the National Institutes of Health's Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery initiative, a large-scale study of long COVID. It can involve the brain, heart, lungs and digestive system. Despite its widespread impact, no proven treatments exist because the underlying cause remains unclear. The new review brings together existing scientific findings and expert opinion to highlight an idea that has received relatively little attention: infections other than the coronavirus itself may be important contributors. Roughly 95 percent of adults carry EBV in a latent form that usually remains silent until an immune challenge such as COVID triggers its reactivation. In one early study, researchers reported that two-thirds of people with long COVID showed markers of recent EBV activity, and those with more symptoms had higher antibody levels. Subsequent studies also linked EBV reactivation with well known features of long COVID, including fatigue and cognitive difficulties. Infections that occur before COVID may weaken the immune system. Infections that arise after recovery could take advantage of lingering immune dysfunction caused by COVID. One idea they discuss, known as "immunity theft," proposes that an episode of acute COVID may leave people more susceptible to other infections. If co-infections truly contribute to long COVID, treatments already available could potentially help. Existing antibiotics and antivirals might be repurposed to target specific underlying infections, and clinical trials could examine whether treating these infections improves long COVID symptoms. No causal relationship has been confirmed between any co-infection and long COVID. She added that verifying the hypothesis would require large epidemiological studies and animal research, yet this work is made more difficult by the lack of reliable animal models for long COVID. The authors hope their findings will encourage more investigation into how co-infections might shape long COVID. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.
