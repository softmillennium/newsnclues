                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Perot Museum of Nature and Science's interactive soccer exhibit has two top-tier sponsors — Verizon and Amazon — and a host of other corporate partners as it gears up for its March opening a few months before FIFA World Cup matches begin in Dallas-Fort Worth. The “Soccer: More Than a Game” exhibit is a 10,000-square-foot project that will allow visitors to test their kicking skills, work on game strategy and learn about how innovation is reshaping the sport. They will see some of the other sponsor names as well.” By signing up, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Michelle Miller, senior vice president at Verizon, said emphasizing the theme “‘Dallas, we've got you covered' is really something that we've been championing across the board. With the World Cup games coming here to Dallas, it was just a perfect connection. We love the fact that it equips visitors with hands-on experiences, so that science and technology and data analytics really are what inspire the future innovators of our community.” Vickie Yakunin, Amazon's head of community affairs for Texas, said in a statement that because soccer on a global scale embodies “curiosity, creativity and shared purpose,” it aligns well with Amazon's values. Amazon is the presenting sponsor of the Coaching Lab for Excellence in Athletics, Technology and Science, which will give visitors a deep dive into game strategy and data analytics. Currently being built in Salt Lake City, the exhibit opens March 7. It will include numerous stations, including one to build a soccer stadium with Lego-like blocks and scan it into a digital model. The exercise pushes designers to consider energy and water efficiency in their stadium builds. Since 2022, when Dallas was named a World Cup host city, the Perot has collaborated with Mexico City's Museo Interactivo de Economía, which is known for its interactive takes on economics, finance and sustainability. “We've also approached sponsors together, because sponsors who want one leg in Mexico City and one leg in Dallas, this is the perfect opportunity for them to get exposure in two countries,” Silver said.

Scotland have been drawn against Brazil, Morocco and Haiti in Group C, with tickets costing between £134 to £524. Speaking on the day that supporter club members can apply for tickets against Haiti and Morocco in Boston, as well as the fixture against Brazil in Miami, Clarke pleaded with the fanbase to not exceed their financial capabilities to attend the tournament. Fans who do not receive any through the Scotland Supporters Club will have to deal with FIFA's dynamic pricing model and resale costs. "We can't control the prices," Clarke told Sky Sports News. "If you can afford to go, then great. But if you can't afford to go, then understand it. Don't put yourself and your family into debt. My biggest wish is that people don't put themselves into too much debt trying to get there. So it's always going to be an expensive World Cup. "I think that's a big thing for me. I'm talking about going to the far-flung places, but maybe only 1,200 people will turn up. I'm quite sure they'll find some great ways to do that." Football Supporters Europe (FSE) stated that rather than adopting a standard price across all group matches, pricing appeared to have been calculated "dependent on vague criteria such as the perceived attractiveness of the fixture". Dynamic pricing will be used in some phases of World Cup ticket sales. Tickets for the Euro 2024 final between England and Spain in Berlin were available from £83. FIFA is refusing to comment after releasing the World Cup ticket prices although it did say that there had been five million ticket requests in 24 hours, which "underlines soaring global demand". FIFA's position on ticket prices has always been that it is a non-profit organisation and any money it makes from ticket sales is reinvested in football. Meanwhile, the Scottish Football Supporters Association (SFSA) have written to SFA CEO Ian Maxwell, regarding ticket pricing after revealing they have been inundated with correspondence from members.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Injury-plagued former Arsenal defender Takehiro Tomiyasu is finally set to return to football after finding a new club following his exit from the Emirates Stadium. Tomiyasu left Arsenal after four years, having played just six minutes of football in the 2024-25 season due to knee surgery. At the time of his release, the defender was not expected to return to full fitness for another five months. The official statement from the Gunners had read: "We have reached a mutual agreement with Takehiro Tomiyasu to end his contract with immediate effect. The 26-year-old defender, who joined us from Bologna in August 2021, made 84 appearances in all competitions during his time with the club. It was therefore mutually agreed to end Tomi's contract in order for him to start a new chapter in his career. Everyone at Arsenal Football Club would like to thank Tomi for his contribution to the club and we wish him and his family all the best for the future." According to Fabrizio Romano, Tomiyasu has now verbally agreed to join Dutch giants Ajax on a short-term deal, which will be valid until 2026. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Known as a reliable performer and strong defender, Tomiyasu has not been able to stay consistently fit in the last few years and this had curtailed his time in north London. But with the emergence of the likes of Jurrien Timber, Riccardo Calafiori and Myles Lewis-Skelly as full-backs since last season, in addition to Tomiyasu's former right-back competitor Ben White still amongst the ranks, Mikel Arteta might have felt that his squad had moved on in Tomiyasu's extended absence. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting While Arsenal continue to lead the Premier League title race and are two points clear of Manchester City in the table, their performance in recent matches has dipped after starting the 2025-26 season in red-hot form. The Spaniard said: "It was a relief, but we have a very clear understanding that the margins should have been bigger. We generated more chances in the second half, but after that we had a period of two or three minutes in deep, totally passive, with horrible defensive habits that are nowhere near the levels required. We should have stopped the shots before, and that is on us." "The longer the game went on, they had hope and we had to accelerate our game and take more risks. We did find a way and that's a very positive thing, if not we'd be very frustrated and rightly so, but there are things to improve obviously."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Africa Cup of Nations 2025 will take place in Morocco from 21 December 2025 to 18 January 2026. Twenty-four men's national football teams from Africa will play in the 2025 CAF Africa Cup of Nations, which is due to be held in Morocco from 21 December 2025 to 18 January 2026. With seven of Africa's nine confirmed 2026 FIFA World Cup teams participating at this year's AFCON, the tournament will also serve as a crucial testing ground ahead of next summer's showpiece in the USA, Canada, and Mexico. In many ways, it will also serve as a test event for Morocco, which is set to co-host the FIFA World Cup 2030 alongside Portugal and Spain. Discover what you need to know about AFCON 2025 below. His name, which means 'lion' in Arabic, reflects strength, pride and leadership, qualities closely linked to both Moroccan heritage and African football. Another distinctive feature of the Africa Cup of Nations is its official song, which often blends sounds from across the continent to create a unifying anthem that resonates with fans both within and beyond Africa. While the official song for AFCON 2025 is expected to be released this week ahead of kick-off, if previous editions are anything to go by, another classic is on the way. All eyes will be on host nation Morocco, whose squad is widely regarded as a golden generation and will be desperate to secure an AFCON title to cement that legacy. After making history as the first African team to reach the semi-finals of a FIFA World Cup in 2022, Morocco suffered a shock Round of 16 exit at the last AFCON tournament in Côte d'Ivoire, despite being considered favourites. They quickly put that disappointment behind them by becoming the first African side to qualify for the FIFA World Cup 2026. The Paris St. Germain defender picked up an ankle injury in November and now faces a race against time to be ready for the competition. Another team carrying significant pressure into the tournament is Nigeria. But a disappointing World Cup qualifying campaign, where they failed to reach back-to-back tournaments, means only lifting the trophy in Morocco will feel like proper compensation. AFCON 2021 (played in 2022) champions Senegal find themselves in Group D, alongside the Democratic Republic of Congo, who are just one intercontinental play-off against New Caledonia away from qualifying for their first FIFA World Cup in 51 years. Familiar names such as London 2012 Olympian Sadio Mané, Kalidou Koulibaly, Nicolas Jackson and Idrissa Gana Gueye were instrumental in securing Senegal's place at the 2026 World Cup, where they kept eight clean sheets in ten qualifying matches. Defending champions Cote d'Ivoire are another team to watch. They took an unlikely route to glory on home soil last January, sacking their head coach after losing their first two group games. Faé has since been appointed on a permanent basis and guided the team through a flawless World Cup qualifying campaign. Inspired by Manchester United's Amad Diallo, the Elephants are widely tipped to be contenders once again. Then there is London 2012 Olympian Mohamed Salah and Egypt. The record seven-time champions have not lifted the trophy since 2010, when they completed an unprecedented hat-trick of consecutive AFCON titles. Salah, then an 18-year-old learning his trade at Al-Mokawloon, has since become one of the greatest players of his generation, yet AFCON success continues to elude him. He has reached two finals (2017 and 2021) but lost both, and with Egypt already qualified for the World Cup, AFCON 2025 is widely seen as a last major opportunity for the 33-year-old Liverpool forward to secure the title that would cement his status as the country's greatest-ever footballer. He will have able support in the likes of Manchester City's Omar Marmoush and Mostafa Mohamed of FC Nantes, who are expected to provide attacking dynamism and depth. A turbulent World Cup qualifying campaign in which they failed to reach the finals was followed by even more upheaval. Federation president Samuel Eto'o Fils, the Barcelona legend and Olympic gold medallist from Sydney 2000, replaced Belgian coach Marc Brys with local trainer David Pagou just three weeks before the tournament. Pagou then omitted star goalkeeper André Onana and influential captain Vincent Aboubakar from the squad for Morocco. Manchester United forward Bryan Mbeumo is expected to be the focal point of their push for a sixth continental crown. South Africa, who surprised many by finishing third in Côte d'Ivoire, will believe they can go even further this time. AFCON 2019 champions Algeria and perennial contenders Tunisia are also expected to mount strong challenges for the most coveted trophy in African football.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Craig Burley and Frank Leboeuf look at Group C, with Brazil, Morocco, Haiti and Burley's Scotland looking to qualify. Scotland will play Haiti and Morocco in Boston and Brazil in Miami but there has been uproar at some of the ticket prices which range from £134 to £524. Fans who do not receive any through the Scotland Supporters Club will have to deal with FIFA's dynamic pricing model and resale costs and the Association of Tartan Army Clubs (ATAC) branded the costs "disgraceful and disgusting". "Tickets are going to be tight," said Clarke, who will not rule out the recruitment of Newcastle attacker Harvey Barnes. "Some of the figures are eye-watering, if you look at them. "One of my biggest wishes is that people don't put themselves too much into debt trying to buy tickets. Even the cheapest ones look to be pretty pricey. "But listen, it's a World Cup, FIFA will tell you they've had five million applications for two million tickets, which shows you the will is there, people want to be there. - Thiago Silva, 41, aiming for Brazil World Cup spot - Wilfried Nancy nightmare start continues as St. Mirren beat Celtic to Scottish League Cup - Harry Kane hits career first with 50th Bayern goal of 2025 "If you go on holiday to America, it's expensive. It's going to be expensive, just make sure people don't put themselves into too much debt. After Scotland's historic win over Denmark, the 28-year-old Newcastle player was asked by Sky Sports if the door had closed on potentially playing for Scotland and said: "No, of course it's not. "It's just one of those things that it's probably too difficult to talk about because you don't know what's going to happen. "Maybe Harvey thinks he's going to get picked for England. He's in a really good vein of form at the moment so let's see what happens. "We've tried to build that across the years, but there are always spaces. "There's always injuries and loss of form to take into account."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here's how Europe's USMNT stars fared at the weekend… Finally, after months of uncertainty at his new club, this is what Gio Reyna needed. Injuries, fitness and subsequent fitful form had reduced him to the periphery at his previous side, Borussia Dortmund, endangering the international spot of a player considered a natural and game-changing talent. But until recently, his only start for the club had come in September's 4-0 home defeat against Werder Bremen. To compound matters, Gladbach's rocky performances led to the sacking of Gerardo Seoane, the head coach who was involved in signing Reyna. National team coach Mauricio Pochettino is an admirer, but it became harder to select a player who was playing so little. The club appointed former reserve-team boss Eugen Polanski as interim coach, and made his appointment permanent in November. It has been a positive development for Reyna, as the 39-year-old clearly values him. Speaking before Saturday's game, Polanski told the Bundesliga website: “We wanted to gradually integrate him and generate more playing time. Although Reyna must compete with midfielder Florian Neuhaus for the starting spot, the German's injury problems have led to opportunities, which have been taken. “We can almost replace Neuhaus like-for-like,” Polanski explained. A direct assist or goal is yet to arrive, but he reminded everyone that he has that threat in his locker against Paraguay and Uruguay last month, when he registered one of each. Initially, there was hope he would be fit to make his belated return in time for Fulham's Carabao Cup quarter-final against Newcastle United on Wednesday. But such was the relief of pain and increased strength after working with a specialist in the north west, former Liverpool head physio Andy Renshaw, that he trained well throughout last week. He started Saturday's 3-2 win over Burnley at Turf Moor and played the full game. “Jedi (Robinson) had a good week,” Silva told Fulham's website after the game. “After two or three months without a game, it's never easy, but we knew that from a physical point of view he'd be ready and he showed that. “I didn't take the decision to change him and let him play the full 96 minutes because he's a great athlete, we know that. In Milan, Christian Pulisic did not quite reach the levels he has been hitting lately. It was a frustrating afternoon for Milan, who only drew 2-2 with Sassuolo at the San Siro. The result saw them drop to second place behind rivals Inter, who beat Genoa 2-1. Extra frustration for Pulisic came from a ruled-out ‘goal' — he was in the right place to convert from close range on 57 minutes but Ruben Loftus-Cheek was adjudged to have fouled a defender. Afterwards, Massimiliano Allegri explained why he took the American off after 73 minutes, even with his side chasing a win — and in the process, the Milan head coach highlighted how Pulisic scored his double against Torino when he was unwell. “I would have done it anyway,” Allegri told DAZN. “Christian had joined us in Turin after a fever and then trained. ”He played well for 72 minutes, but at that moment, we needed one more midfielder.” Teenage centre-back Noahkai Banks played the full 90 minutes of Augsburg's 1-0 defeat against Eintracht Frankfurt. It was his ninth consecutive start in the Bundesliga — not bad for a 19-year-old defender in one of Europe's top divisions. Also in Germany, Malik Tillman impressed for Bayer Leverkusen in their 2-0 win against Koln, and James Sands played the full game for St Pauli as they beat Heidenheim 2-1. Compatriot Sergino Dest shone too, setting up the game's winner with a sublime first touch and run that gave Guus Til a goal to make it 4-3 against Heracles Almelo. In the Premier League, there was a rare setback for Chris Richards and Crystal Palace, who lost 3-0 at Selhurst Park to an Erling Haaland-inspired Manchester City.

Vice-president of German parliament slams ‘disgusting' ceremony in which Donald Trump received peace prize, and calls ticket prices ‘insane'

A vice-president of Germany's parliament has hit out at Fifa over a “disgusting” World Cup draw ceremony where US President Donald Trump played a big role and “completely insane” ticket prices for the tournament.

Omid Nouripour from the Green Party, one of the vice-presidents of the lower house Bundestag, said on Sunday that “Fifa is not doing itself a favour in the long run. The neutrality is broken in quite a bad way.”

Trump was honoured with a new Fifa peace prize at the December 5 draw in Washington for the 2026 tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Fifa countered criticism on the closeness of its president Gianni Infantino to Trump by saying that such “good relationships” to top politicians of host countries were essential to guarantee a successful event.

Nouripour called the ceremony “disgusting” and also joined the criticism on the ticket prices for fans by saying the costs are “completely insane”.

Listing the prices for fans of its match contingents, the German FA said that the cheapest group stage ticket would cost €155 (US$180) and that a fan interested in attending every Germany match including the final – if the team makes it – would have to splash out at least €5,975.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2026 World Cup is now less than six months away for the U.S. men's national team, who will get their tournament underway in Los Angeles, California. While they know they will face Australia, Paraguay, and one of Slovakia, Kosovo, Türkiye or Romania in the group stage, the roster is still very much in flux, especially as Mauricio Pochettino sees stellar form from some hopeful World Cup talents in Europe. Unlike past years, the USMNT won't have a January camp to see some players in person, meaning their next games come in the March window, where they will hope to fine-tune what the final roster could look like. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. Likely the leading choice to start the USMNT's first World Cup match, Folarin Balogun continued his strong form this season in Ligue 1 and the Champions League.The 24-year-old scored the winning goal in Monaco's 1–0 win over Galatasaray—his seventh goal of the campaign and third in Europe—and then saw an effort ruled out for offside during the weekend defeat to Tim Weah's Marseille.Though that game didn't go the way Balogun wanted it to, he put in a decent shift up front for Monaco, completing four dribbles and taking three shots on goal. Malik Tillman continues to settle in at Bayer Leverkusen after his blockbuster signing in the summer and helped the club to a 2–0 Rhine Derby win over rivals FC Köln.The dynamic attacking midfielder had two shots and created two chances while playing alongside Jonas Hoffman and also stepped up with five defensive contributions. Playing in a 3-5-1-1 formation for Leverkusen, he has shown his ability to work the ball centrally but also engage in overlapping runs from the wingbacks, a factor which could be valuable to Pochettino after his switch to using a back three. The 22-year-old American scored in UEFA Champions League action against Atlético Madrid midweek, then scored a perfectly placed penalty kick against Heracles Almelo in Eredivisie action on the weekend.Pepi has now scored in four-straight matches across all competitions, becoming the first American to do so for an Eredivisie club since Aron Jóhannsson for AZ in 2013-14.The former FC Dallas starlet has nine goals in all competitions this season and will look to close out 2025 in strong form, setting the stage for the 2026 World Cup year. This Weston McKennie goal in slow-mo is a work of art 🔥🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/wXWihmBLiM Weston McKennie continued to impress with Juventus this season, scoring a goal in a 2–0 midweek Champions League win against Pafos, before playing 90 minutes in the 1–0 Serie A victory over Bologna. Although he has yet to find the back of the net in Serie A action and was unable to make the most of extra space after Bologna's red card on Sunday, he has shown an ability to be clinical in the biggest matches on European soccer's biggest stage.At the same time, his growth as a balanced wide midfielder is commendable, and the 27-year-old looks more comfortable as Juventus continues to grow under midseason managerial appointment, Luciano Spalletti. Antonee Robinson impressed in his first Premier League start of the season with Fulham on Saturday, returning to the lineup after undergoing knee surgery prior to the 2025–26 campaign.Robinson, 28, played the full 90 minutes in a 3–2 win over Burnley, moving his side up to 13th in the Premier League and boosting his stock with the USMNT as Pochettino seeks options for a three and five-man backline.He was significantly productive in the match as well, completing eight passes into the final third, while posting six recoveries, four tackles and two interceptions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Because of the things I've heard in the last 48 hours, from various reliable people including our own Simon, that all changed. Head Coach Enzo Maresca's comments about the worst 48 hours of his Chelsea career, and the subsequent reports from Simon, Ben Jacobs and others, have made clear there's some major issues at the top of Chelsea FC. The response of the club was to dismiss them as an emotional overreaction, reiterate their commitment to their strategy, and also things which I took as a brief against Maresca. I read a brief saying they'd recommended a rotation policy to Maresca which he supported and enacted. But when it didn't work, suddenly they put all the blame onto him for the rotations….ones THEY recommended. Maresca publicly took responsibility for Leeds, rightly so. But he expects those above him to take responsibility for their mistakes and not make him the sole scapegoat for it. We've seen this before with the current Sporting Directors, so its no surprise. They had also briefed, separately,  last Thursday, that Maresca will be pressured to make the most of what he has for the rest of the season. Basically shutting down any requests for January signings (which we need, but who cares, its not like we're trying to be successful, eh? Not to mention there was a briefing saying “Maresca is expected to address these comments in his press conference on Monday”. Which to me suggests he's being pressured to toe the club line and say he was being emotional. But either way, its clear things are very tense at the top. I believe in the clubs overall long term strategy. We've signed some excellent players, built a top 4 squad which can win cups and appointed an excellent manager in Enzo Maresca. Fair play to the owners and Sporting Directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley for that, credit where its due. But I'm just done with the at times shoddy man management and abysmal treatment of certain players and staff by the Sporting Directors, and their overall conduct. They have now fallen out with and failed to adequately back multiple head coaches, all whilst keeping their jobs and getting longer contracts. Not to mention very publicly trying to force talented, respected players out of the club multiple times, sometimes succeeding, sometimes not. Then there's the constant insults to fans' intelligence with their ridiculous briefings which everyone knows are complete bullshit and media spin. They've broken trust with fans, most of who don't trust them anymore and never will. Finally of course there's their complete and utter inability to build a squad capable of competing for Premier League titles, which is or should be the ultimate goal. Because if they think adding more raw, unproven young talent with no PL experience next summer to a squad which already has tons of raw players, is going create a title challenge next year, they're kidding themselves. The two people running the football side, have yet to show they have a clue how to do that. Neither have ever worked at a big club before, never been in an elite performance environment in their life. Because of that, we don't have one at Chelsea yet. They DO deserve credit for getting us back to being a steady top 4 squad who can win knockout competitions. They can spot and sign young talent well. I'm always happy to give credit where its due, this isn't an agenda driven post and I won't make personal attacks, this is a professional critique. I don't believe they have what it takes to help Chelsea take the next step, and quite frankly I don't like the way they conduct their jobs and treat players and staff who are not wanted, as I mentioned above. They are not the best in class. Best in class prove it before they join Chelsea. We're not a work experience program for aspiring sporting directors who'd never won a thing before they came here and worked only at smaller clubs. Even now, when so many can see it, even pundits, they won't accept or acknowledge they've made mistakes or shoulder responsibility. Enzo Maresca has won two trophies, got top four, beaten several of the top teams and top managers in Europe, and got us 4th in the PL this year, third highest scorers, third best defence, without Levi Colwill, Cole Palmer or a 9 most of the season, and with a litany of injuries leaving us to overplay Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez, combined with fatigue from the Club World Cup and a short pre season. Maresca HAS made mistakes and bad decisions, but I'd be surprised if any coach could do much better this year given the circumstances - some circumstances directly caused by the Sporting Directors. It's become clear the club heirarchy don't care at all or listen to what fans think, they don't even respect us or our views, or listen to us. It takes a better man to admit he was wrong and learn from it, than one who passes the buck to someone, and damages the club in the process My dream for Chelsea is becoming consistent PL challengers and winners again, and a dominant side in Europe. With the money spent, that's where we should be heading. We have wasted so much money that probably would have made us contenders now, and we could still have kept within our strategy of signing under 25s too. That's what's so annoying, is the strategy from the club CAN work, but they've handled it awfully. Not winning it maybe, but in the race till April or so, finishing 2nd ideally, or 3rd, single digit points off the top. If we're not in a position to challenge next season, the people who've overseen this rebuild and recruited two managers so far to oversee it are the ones solely to blame. A head coach can only work with the tools he's been given. That's why Maresca is so frustrated, because the potential is there in this squad, but there's some gaping holes which remain unaddressed, and which will remain so at least till the summer, and then they'll sign more raw talent which will mean whoever is head coach will have to develop them, rather than go for a title. Signing raw talent is bad, but bringing new raw talent into the squad for more proven players every year will keep you stagnating, not win Premier Leagues. In almost any high performance organisation, an employee cannot remain in post if they have had time, money, authority to make big decisions and not delivered. And with the target of dominating Europe and the PL, if we don't start delivering soon, then things need to change right at the top. The media are already noticing it, thanks in part to Maresca's statement, as well as their own feelings on our recruitment, so eventually, there'll be nowhere to hide. I won't buy it, but some will. There's no good, football based reason for Enzo Maresca to leave Chelsea, not backing him, hanging him out to dry and letting him go is absolute madness and unless we hire someone of the calibre of Thomas Tuchel, Xabi Alonso or Oliver Glasner, could set the club back a year or two. If the SD's stay in post with the next manager, I'd bet good money we'll be here again a couple of years with the same issues, and it will be the same people to blame, undoubtedly. Then they'll try to scapegoat someone that manager, without a doubt. Anything to avoid showing some actual cajones and genuinely taking responsibility for their actions. The day they are shifted to other roles and Dave Fallows takes their job, I will feel some hope of being a major force again. He's proven he's a winner, and a best in class operator, and that's what Chelsea need in charge now. THAT'S how serious, elite football clubs operate.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker's grand plan for a "U.S. Way" sounds at first like talking down from the top. Sometimes, it feels like there's a distance between the U.S. men's and women's soccer teams, even though they wear the same crest. Over the years, various people involved with both programs have tried to close that gap, including at U.S. Soccer headquarters. In some countries, every national team would be required to play the same way. » READ MORE: Mauricio Pochettino reflects on the USMNT's progress during his tenure so far His experience gives him power if he wants to exercise it. Before joining U.S. Soccer in 2023, previous stops for the native Welshman included seven years at English soccer's governing body, the Football Association. “But ultimately their job is to provide winning teams, and I think they're doing a pretty good job at doing that. If you're deep in the sport, especially the American game, you know it matters to hear that from someone so high-ranking. “The way I see it is, my job is not to dictate every single detail of how everything needs to look or feel,” Crocker said. “I need to use their experiences, because they've got more than me in those areas of what winning looks like.” She knew Pochettino before taking the U.S. job because they overlapped at English club Chelsea, and she knew American soccer from many years of working here before returning to her native London in 2012. “And we both have an appreciation that American players have their own unique set of qualities that we can lean into.” » READ MORE: Alex Morgan looks back at her history in Chester — and forward to the USWNT's bright future How they execute from there is up to them. “But within that, some of those differences are in and around the game model.” That might not sound like much, but it really does matter. That, too, has seemed deliberate at times, with so many factions in the sport wanting to do what they want instead of working together for the game as a whole. America's youth soccer landscape, which better resembles an industrial complex — and really feels that big, in terms of scale — has a long history of rebelling against being told what to do by U.S. Soccer. Crocker quickly became well-versed in this when he took his job, and has spent a lot of time trying to change the tone. » READ MORE: There are 72 group stage games in next summer's World Cup. “I think we have to recognize that what we do in state X can't just be replicated and put into state Y,” he said. But we've also got to be clear on the framework of the things that are fundamental, and that we are going to do irrespective.” “You could bring every county FA to St. George's Park, all of which were within a three-hour drive [from the national training center],” Crocker said. Doing this is something I've never experienced before.” That literal geography, not just youth soccer politics, influenced his journey to now. “I don't think there's one silver bullet that you need to take, or you go, ‘It's not going to work because of X,'” he said. “I just think we have to recognize the uniqueness of the country, build on that as a positive, but also remember not to make the same mistakes as others that have gone before us.” Then came words that a lot of people — especially the youth coaches out there — have wanted to hear. But the hardest part is yet to come, as a recent moment showed. » READ MORE: Philly fans are ready for the ‘once in a lifetime experience' of hosting a World Cup in their hometown Earlier this month, Crocker spoke to a crowd of the governing body's sponsors and donors. “For those who are not familiar with the youth soccer landscape in this country, it's a bit of a disaster, right?” Donovan said. He spoke of a local club near his home in southern California, but knew it could have been countless others. “So what's the incentive now for these clubs to change? “There's been a lot of talk about, there's a player that plays in this league over here that has to drive or fly thousands of miles because this league is falling out with this league, and they won't play each other. “I think it's being respectful to environments that have already been created,” he said. “Us as U.S. Soccer, being the national federation, the people that should be really saying, ‘Hey this is what player development and the game could look like in this country' — it's about time we spoke up and started to share some of that. Crocker's plans are due to be published in January, the same month Philadelphia will host the 2026 United Soccer Coaches convention. It won't be easy for him to get that crowd on his side, for the reasons Donovan made clear. » READ MORE: Brazil and France headline the teams coming to Philadelphia for next year's World Cup</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Isolina de la Vega was hooked on soccer from the first time she saw a match. But de la Vega's great grandfather was the president of a local soccer club, and her father was a big fan, too. “One day I say (to) my father, ‘Okay, I want to go and see one match, and if I like, you pay the ticket for me for all time,'” de la Vega said. De la Vega moved to Kansas City with her husband, Dario, three and a half years ago and opened Los Hornos Argentinian Flavors in the Northland. She doesn't see as many matches these days, but she's still a passionate soccer fan — especially of reigning World Cup champion Argentina. When Argentinian soccer superstar Lionel Messi visited Kansas City for a match between Inter Miami, his Major League Soccer team, and Sporting KC, she tracked down Inter Miami's chef and delivered empanadas to give to Messi. Messi gifted her a signed jersey and flag in return. De la Vega attended the FIFA Final Draw watch party at Power and Light when organizers announced Argentina would play a group-stage match in Kansas City. “We are super excited and waiting for the World Cup,” she said. Argentina and six other nations will play matches in Kansas City during the World Cup next year. Orlando Cachiguango already had a World Cup game on his bucket list, and when FIFA announced the United States would co-host with Mexico and Canada, he knew he had to try to go. That feeling has only compounded since he found out Ecuador will play a match against Curaçao in Kansas City during the first round of the tournament. “Even if Ecuador played in another city I was planning to see, you know, it's once in a lifetime, ” he said. “It's something that every soccer fan would like to have, you know? Cachiguango hasn't secured his seats to the game yet. But fans can apply for tickets in FIFA's Random Selection Draw, which runs until Jan. 13. Prices currently range from a minimum of $140 for the match between Algeria and Austria to as high as $1,265 for Kansas City's quarterfinal match. Kansas City expects to welcome at least 650,000 visitors during its month of hosting matches. For those with ties to Kansas City and the countries that will play, it's an opportunity to share their culture with Kansas City, and Kansas City with their home countries. “It's kind of like football here in Kansas… how people follow the Chiefs here, I would say it's the same, or a little bit more.” Algeria will play two matches at Arrowhead Stadium during the group stage, and Malem is confident his home country will pick Kansas City as a base camp. Patrick Bakker, a Dutch citizen who has lived in Overland Park since 2002, says he's excited to share game-day traditions with Americans. Claudia Luna West, who owns Buenos Aires Restaurant in Shawnee, hopes more Kansas Citians will appreciate Argentine culture with the national team coming to play. It's so rich, the cultural impact from Argentina,” West said. “If someone visits my restaurant they can see it.” West also wants to capitalize on the opportunity. And she plans to serve as a tour guide for visiting Argentinians. She's already heard from one group asking for places to go when they visit. It qualified for the first time ever this year, in a 0-0 draw against Jamaica. Sonya Kieffer, a Curaçao resident who grew up in Kansas City, says the country is full of national pride right now. A lot of people, they don't even know how to pronounce Curaçao,” Kieffer said. “I don't know if you caught when they were drawing the names, and (Wayne Gretzky) said it wrong. Kieffer won't make it home to Kansas City for the June 20 match against Ecuador, but she's okay with it. “If I could choose, I'd rather stay here with all the locals to watch the game together,” she said. And Kansas City would not be on the map,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester United's Mason Mount has made 13 appearances and scored three goals so far this season Ruben Amorim's first public observations on Mason Mount after his appointment as Manchester United head coach just over a year ago have stood the test of time. It has taken longer than hoped for United's fanbase to come to the same conclusion, but Mount's goal and overall performance at Wolves last week had them purring. Now the phrase most used about him is: "His quality was never in doubt." Almost two and a half years into the five-year contract he signed in July 2023, Mount's own bold declarations about the future have some meaning. "I am hugely ambitious," he said on his arrival at Old Trafford. "I will be giving everything to experience that again at Manchester United." It is fair to say the statement of intent Mount made after completing his £55m move from Chelsea is yet to be fulfilled. A Champions League and Club World Cup winner with Chelsea, Mount was an injury-time substitute for United's 2024 FA Cup final victory over Manchester City. Speak privately to people who know Mount well and you get the impression restoring United's fortunes offered the kind of challenge that enthused him. "He's a very smart player," was Amorim's response when asked about Mount on Friday before Monday's Premier League game with Bournemouth. "Sometimes being a technical player is not just having fun with the ball. Amorim is not alone at United's Carrington training ground in recognising Mount's qualities. He is certainly not the only one genuinely glad a player who can offer so much is able to put injury issues to one side and deliver performances on a consistent basis. No-one would argue the past couple of years have been easy. Mount himself has admitted dealing with two extended absences and a couple of smaller frustrating ones was tough. But staff around Carrington admired the professional attitude Mount adopted throughout his various recoveries. He is regarded as a link within Amorim's squad - someone who knits groups of players together - which has been particularly evident this season when, it is generally acknowledged, United's players have remained tight and focused on delivering better results. He spends time with a couple of kids who are regulars outside the training ground, has spoken with them and their parents and still wears a bracelet one of them gave him. Outstanding in the win at Crystal Palace on 30 November, Mount followed up with an excellent performance against Wolves, who were admittedly poor at Molineux but proved they can be obdurate and diligent in their unlucky loss at Arsenal. Goals in both victories have taken his overall tally for United to seven, to match his shirt number, a fact not lost on the club's content creators who put them all on the app and launched a vote for which was the best. Will Mount be reunited with Tuchel at international level? The pair were spotted chatting after last month's home defeat by Everton and while competition for World Cup places is fierce and Mount is rated as unlikely to break in at this stage, it cannot entirely be discounted. The player himself is not setting that as a target. Mount has missed one game so far this season though injury. Ask about Man Utd - what do you want to know?

The last may not have been heard about the Super Eagles qualification for the 2026 World Cup after senior officials expressed confidence that DR Congo will be thrown out of the competition for parading several ineligible players.

“The chances of the petition against DR Congo sailing through is even better than when South Africa were docked three points and three goals for fielding an ineligible player against Lesotho in a qualifier,” a top source told SCORENigeria

“A petition has been fired against DRC in respect of the eligibility of several of their players who featured in the World Cup Playoffs in Morocco.

“There's still hope for the Super Eagles as long as the Intercontinental Playoffs in Mexico has not been played.”

SCORENigeria further learnt that this petition has the full backing of the Federal Government of Nigeria.

In November, DRC qualified for the Intercontinental Playoffs after they beat the Super Eagles on penalties after both teams were tied on 1-1 even after extra time.
