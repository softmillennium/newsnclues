FBI Assistant Director in Charge Akil Davis announces developments on a terrorism investigation during a press conference Monday, Dec. 15, 2025, in Los Angeles. First Assistant United States Attorney Bill Essayli, right, speaks in front of LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell during a press conference announcing developments on a terrorism investigation Monday, Dec. 15, 2025, in Los Angeles. LOS ANGELES (AP) — Federal authorities said Monday that they foiled a plot to bomb multiple U.S. companies on New Year's Eve in Southern California, announcing the arrests of members of an extremist anti-capitalist and anti-government group. The four suspects were arrested Friday as they were testing explosives in the desert east of Los Angeles, First Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said during a news conference. Officials showed reporters surveillance aerial footage of the four suspects moving a large black object in the desert to a table shortly before their arrests. They are all from the Los Angeles area, Essayli said. Officials did not describe a motive but said they are members of an offshoot of a pro-Palestinian group dubbed the Turtle Island Liberation Front. Each faces charges including conspiracy and possession of a destructive device, Essayli said, adding that additional charges were expected in coming weeks. Essayli said Carroll last month created a detailed plan to bomb five or more locations across Southern California on New Year's Eve and were trying to hit multiple companies. He declined to name the companies but described them as “Amazon-type” logistical centers. The plan included planting backpacks filled with explosive devices at multiple businesses that were set to blow up simultaneously at midnight on New Year's Eve, according to officials and the criminal complaint. Two of the group's members also had discussed plans for future attacks including targeting Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and vehicles with pipe bombs in 2026, according to the criminal complaint. “Carroll stated that some of those plans would quote ‘take some of them out and scare the rest,'” Essayli said. The plans were discussed both at an in-person meeting with members in Los Angeles and through an encrypted messaging app, Essayli said. Evidence photos included in the court documents show a desert campsite with what investigators said were bomb-making materials strewn across plastic folding tables. The suspects “all brought bomb-making components to the campsite, including various sizes of PVC pipes, suspected potassium nitrate, charcoal, charcoal powder, sulfur powder, and material to be used as fuses, among others,” the complaint states. The plan stated that the backpacks would contain complex pipe bombs and included instructions on how to manufacture them and also how to avoid leaving evidence behind tracing anything back to the group, officials said. The suspects recently had acquired precursor chemicals and other items, they added. Last week they were rehearsing their attack and testing devices in the desert near Twentynine Palms, California, before federal authorities moved in, officials said. Authorities issued search warrants and found posters for the Turtle Island Liberation Front at Carroll's home that called for “Death to America,” and “Death to ICE,” Essayli said. In Page's residence, police found a copy of the detailed bomb plan, he added. Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said while federal and local officials disagree on the Trump administration's immigration raids, they come together still to protect residents. The LAPD does not stop people or take action for any reason related to immigration status, and it doesn't enforce immigration laws, a practice that has been in place for 45 years.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reacts during a press conference with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, Monday, Dec. 15, 2025. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrives at the Bellevue Palace for talks with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in Berlin, Germany, Monday, Dec. 15, 2025. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, center left, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, center right, attend the German-Ukrainian Economic Forum in Berlin, Germany, Monday, Dec. 15, 2025. BERLIN (AP) — The U.S. has agreed to provide unspecified security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal to end Russia's nearly four-year war, and more talks are likely this weekend, U.S. officials said Monday following the latest discussions with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin. The officials said talks with President Donald Trump's envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, led to narrowing differences on security guarantees that Kyiv said must be provided, as well as Moscow's demand that Ukraine concede land in the Donbas region in the country's east. Trump was expected to dial into a dinner Monday evening with negotiators and European leaders, and more talks are likely this weekend in Miami or elsewhere in the United States, according to the U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly by the White House. The U.S. officials also said there is consensus on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan, and that Russia has indicated it is open to Ukraine joining the European Union, something it previously said it did not object to. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the Ukrainians, Americans and Europeans agree that “a ceasefire should be secured by substantial legal and material security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe,” calling it a “truly far-reaching, substantial agreement that we did not have before, namely that both Europe and the U.S. are jointly prepared to do this.” Zelenskyy has emphasized that any Western security assurances would need to be legally binding and supported by the U.S. Congress. But Ukraine's preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression. Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of Donetsk region still under its control as a key condition for peace. The Russian president has cast Ukraine's bid to join NATO as a major threat to Moscow's security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine renounce the bid for alliance membership as part of any prospective peace settlement. He is absolutely not open to any tricks aimed at stalling for time.” Putin has denied plans to attack any European allies. Russia fired 153 drones of various types at Ukraine overnight Sunday into Monday, according to Ukraine's Air Force, which said 133 drones were neutralized, while 17 more hit their targets. In Russia, the Defense Ministry on Monday said forces destroyed 130 Ukrainian drones overnight. An additional 16 drones were destroyed between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. local time. Eighteen drones were shot down over Moscow itself, the defense ministry said. Flights were temporarily halted at the city's Domodedovo and Zhukovsky airports as part of safety measures, officials said. Damage details and casualty figures were not immediately available.

Police Chief Jim McDonnell said Nick Reiner, 32, has been “booked for murder” and is being held on $4 million bail in connection with the deaths of his parents. “They worked throughout the night on this case and were able to take into custody Nick Reiner, a suspect in this case,” McDonnell said.

Relatives of Lear, the legendary producer who died in 2023, said their deaths left them bereft. “Norman often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary, to us and the world,” said a Lear family statement. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called it a devastating loss for the city. “An acclaimed actor, director, producer, writer, and engaged political activist, he always used his gifts in service of others.” Associated Press Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton in Los Angeles contributed.</p>

Jurors have convicted Brian Walshe of murdering his wife, Ana, after she disappeared on New Year's Day in 2023. The decision was reached Monday morning after jurors began deliberating on Friday. Brian's lawyers rested their case on Thursday morning without calling him to the stand. He previously pleaded guilty to lying to police officers after Ana disappeared and improperly disposing of her body, but he denied killing her. Prosecutors said Brian killed his wife before disposing of her remains. Brian Walshe appears at Quincy District Court on a charge of murdering his wife Ana Walshe, in Quincy, Massachusetts, U.S. on January 18, 2023. Larry Tipton, Brian's attorney, said during closing arguments that his client "loved Ana Walshe, the mother of his three children." "There's no evidence that he deliberately premeditated the murder. There's no evidence that he ever intended to kill Ana Walshe. Assistant Norfolk County DA Anne Yas, however, said that Brian murdered Ana then hid her body to hide the crime.

Former Vice President Kamala thanked her supporters Friday at the Democratic National Committee's annual winter meeting for "standing up for our democracy" and "the rule of law." It appears to be game on in the race for the next Democratic presidential nomination, as two of the party's most high-profile politicians, who are considered potential top-tier 2028 contenders, stirred more speculation at a major Democratic Party summit. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrats' 2024 standard-bearer after then-President Joe Biden exited the race, showcased an edgier stump speech as she railed against both major parties and the political status quo in an address at the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) winter meeting this past weekend. Gavin Newsom landed the red carpet treatment, as he mingled with delegates during the opening day of the DNC's confab, which was held this year in Los Angeles, home turf to both Harris and Newsom. The main focus for the hundreds of committee members and party officials who attended the summit was reviewing the party's decisive victories in last month's 2025 elections and better than expected performances in this year's special elections, and training sessions to prepare for next year's crucial midterm contests. Former Vice President Kamala, seen speaking at an event in San Francisco in April, delivered a major address on Friday at the Democratic National Committee's winter meeting, which was held in Los Angeles. "Obviously, we must focus on the midterms," Harris said in her Friday speech. "But Democrats, we must also have a clear vision for what comes after the midterms. Harris argued that "both parties have failed to hold the public's trust" and that "people are done with the status quo, and they're ready to break things to force change." And Harris, who was swept by President Donald Trump in all key battleground states in the 2024 election, said that Trump is representative of a bigger problem plaguing the nation's politics. "He and the rise of the MAGA movement, I believe, are a symptom of a failed system that is the result of years of outsourcing and offshoring, financial deregulation, growing income inequality, a broken campaign finance system and endless partisan gridlock all contributing to how we got here today," she emphasized. And when she alluded to who would be in contention for the 2028 nomination, some in the room shouted, "You." According to those in the room, Harris also landed a warm welcome less than 24 hours earlier as she spoke at the United Farm Workers annual gala. Expect to see more of Harris in the new year, helping Democrats from coast to coast as the party works to win back congressional majorities in the midterms. Among the stops is one in South Carolina, a crucial early-voting primary state in the Democratic Party's presidential nominating calendar. While Newsom didn't address the delegates at Friday's general session, he was treated like a VIP on Thursday as he held meetings and mingled with delegates during the opening day of the winter meeting. A DNC committee member who witnessed the commotion told Fox News Digital, "Newsom received a rock star reception as he was mobbed by party leaders and activists alike while he attempted to walk from meeting to meeting." Newsom on Thursday met with the Democratic Party chairs from New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state, and Nevada, another crucial early voting state. Gavin Newsom, seen speaking at the 2025 New York Times DealBook Summit in New York City on Dec. 3, enjoyed a very warm reception as he held meetings at the Democratic National Committee's winter meeting, on Thursday in Los Angeles. "We had a great discussion on a wide range of issues," longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley told Fox News Digital. Newsom's stature in his own party has soared this year, thanks to his very vocal and visual pushback against the president, including his viral social media trolling of Trump and his successful California push to counter the Republican congressional redistricting effort. "Newsom has shown an ability to stand up to Trump in a bold and highly effective manner without shying away from core democratic values," veteran Democratic strategist Joe Caiazzo told Fox News Digital. While both Newsom and Harris made a splash at the DNC winter meeting, they both have plenty of detractors who worry that neither would be electable in 2028 when the Democrats try to win back the White House. And if one or both of them launch presidential campaigns, they'll likely be joined by a large crowd of other contenders. One of those possible White House hopefuls is Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, seen attending a Veterans Day ceremony in Chicago's Little Village neighborhood on Nov. 11, 2025, held a major fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee, on the sidlelines of its winter meeting, in Los Angeles on Thursday. Fox News Digital confirmed that the billionaire governor helped raise over $1 million for the DNC at a fundraiser Thursday night. A DNC insider said the appearances by Harris, Newsom and Pritzker gave "them an opportunity to start honing in on a winning message for Democrats in 2028." There are more than a dozen other Democrats thought to be potential 2028 White House contenders. And most of them have also been paying visits to the early voting states, as well as parachuting onto the 2025 campaign trail.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal authorities disrupted what the Justice Department described as a “massive and horrific” terrorist plot targeting Los Angeles on New Year's Eve, arresting multiple alleged members of a left-wing extremist group accused of planning coordinated bombings across Southern California. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced on Monday that the DOJ, working with the FBI, prevented a series of planned attacks by a group that calls itself the Turtle Island Liberation Front, which officials characterized as pro-Palestinian, anti-government, anti-capitalist, and hostile toward law enforcement. After an intense investigation, the Department of Justice, working with our @FBI, prevented what would have been a massive and horrific terror plot in the Central District of California (Orange County and Los Angeles).The Turtle Island Liberation Front—a far-left,… “After an intense investigation, the Department of Justice, working with our FBI, prevented what would have been a massive and horrific terror plot in the Central District of California,” Bondi said in a statement posted to X. According to federal authorities, four alleged members of the group were arrested over the weekend in Lucerne Valley, a desert area northeast of Los Angeles, where authorities believe they were preparing to test improvised explosive devices ahead of the planned attacks. The suspects identified themselves as part of a radical offshoot of the Turtle Island Liberation Front and were allegedly plotting coordinated IED attacks on five separate locations in Los Angeles. Bondi described the group as motivated by pro-Palestinian, anti-law-enforcement, and anti-government ideology. That suspect is accused of planning a separate attack and faces related federal charges, according to the FBI. An Instagram account attributed to the groups says its founding chapter is based in Los Angeles and calls for the liberation of “Turtle Island,” an Indigenous term often used to describe North America, from what it describes as the “illegal American empire.” Other posts feature images of masked demonstrators wearing keffiyehs and holding signs that say “DEATH TO ICE!! A post shared by Turtle Island Liberation Front (@turtleislandliberationfrontla) Attorneys' Offices and the FBI to ensure Americans can live in peace,” she said. Federal authorities said additional charges or arrests are possible as the investigation continues.</p>

Day 15 of the 2025 Space Telescope Advent Calendar

Day 15 of the 2025 Space Telescope Advent Calendar: A Turbulent Lagoon. Back in 2018, to celebrate its 28th anniversary in space, scientists pointed the Hubble Space Telescope at the Lagoon Nebula, a roiling cloud of gas and dust about 4,000 light-years away, to capture this image, which shows just a small section of a much larger star-forming region.

See the full advent calendar here, where a new image will be revealed each day until December 25.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Film director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead in their California home this weekend, sparking many questions. Nick Reiner, the couple's 32-year-old son, was arrested on Sunday and is being held on a felony charge with a $4 million bail, according to Los Angeles Police Department jail records reviewed by the Washington Examiner. Here's what we know about the incident so far. Police found two bodies at the Reiners' home around 3:40 p.m. on Sunday after responding to a death investigation. Deputy LAPD Chief Alan Hamilton said authorities were trying to obtain a search warrant for the home. A family member found the couple with their throats cut, TMZ reported, and told police a different family member murdered them. “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner,” the family said in a statement. Several major Democrats also mourned Reiner, a large donor to liberal causes. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), and former Vice President Kamala Harris expressed their sorrow on social media. He backed Harris in the 2024 presidential election and contributed more than $12,000 to her campaign. “Michelle and I are heartbroken by the tragic passing of Rob Reiner and his beloved wife, Michele,” Obama wrote on X. “Rob's achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen,” he added. “But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people—and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action.” Newsom and his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, said they are “heartbroken by the tragic loss of Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner,” with the governor adding, “Rob will be remembered for his remarkable filmography and for his extraordinary contribution to humanity.” Harris, a possible 2028 presidential candidate, said Reiner “has impacted generations of Americans.” “The characters, dialogue, and visuals he brought to life in film and television are woven throughout our culture,” she wrote on X. Reiner directed entertainment hits in the 1980s and 1990s, such as Stand by Me, This Is Spinal Tap, A Few Good Men, When Harry Met Sally, and The Princess Bride. He earned nominations at the Golden Globe Awards for three of those movies, as well as one for 1995's The American President. The Los Angeles Times described his work as having an “astonishing versatility,” as he directed everything from an intense courtroom drama to a romantic comedy. Reiner also worked as an actor, making his mark as Mike “Meathead” Stivic on CBS's All in the Family, which ran from 1971 to 1979. He earned two Emmys for his performance as Stivic. Among his most notable recent acting roles was a supporting part in 2013's The Wolf of Wall Street, directed by Martin Scorsese. Singer Reiner worked as a photographer, producer, and actress on some of her husband's projects and was nominated for an Emmy for his 2024 documentary, Albert Brooks: Defending My Life.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The couple was found dead on Sunday in what police are calling an “apparent homicide.” Nick Reiner, the couple's 32-year-old son, was arrested on Sunday and is being held on a felony charge with a $4 million bail, according to LAPD jail records reviewed by the Washington Examiner. “Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.” Trump often says his opponents are afflicted with “Trump Derangement Syndrome,” an ailment once defined by Urban Dictionary as a “mental condition in which a person has been driven effectively insane due to their dislike of Donald Trump, to the point at which they will abandon all logic and reason.” “He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession with President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before,” Trump concluded. Reiner, a prominent Democratic donor, expressed fierce opposition to Trump online and deleted his X account following the 2024 election. Trump's Truth Social post triggered negative reactions from across the political spectrum. In related news, Trump's grave will reek of ammonia for all eternity,” Lincoln Project co-founder Rick Wilson wrote on X. Reps. Marjorie Taylor-Greene (R-GA) and Thomas Massie (R-KY) called the president out for his social media post, suggesting it was in poor taste. This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies,” Greene wrote on X, adding that the situation “should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.” I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the [vice president], and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid?</p>

FIRST ON FOX — Federal authorities say they disrupted a credible terrorist threat over the weekend, arresting four alleged members of a radical pro-Palestinian extremist group accused of planning coordinated New Year's Eve bombings in Los Angeles. The FBI told Fox News Digital that the members self-identified as part of a radical offshoot of the Turtle Island Liberation Front (TILF), an extremist group motivated by pro-Palestinian, anti-law-enforcement, and anti-government ideology. According to the FBI, they were allegedly planning coordinated bombing attacks on New Year's Eve using improvised explosive devices, targeting five separate locations across Los Angeles. The agency said the four were arrested in Lucerne Valley, where they were believed to be preparing to test explosive devices ahead of the planned attacks. They have each been charged with conspiracy and possession of a destructive device. A break in the weather offers a clear view north along Avalon Boulevard in South Los Angeles on Nov. 9, 2022, after a record-setting storm swept through the region. The FBI said Monday that a fifth individual believed to be connected to the same TILF extremist group was arrested in New Orleans for allegedly planning a separate attack. A TILF Instagram account said its founding chapter is in Los Angeles, and its goal is to free "Turtle Island," an Indigenous name used to refer to North America, from the "illegal American empire." "Freeing the world from American imperialism is the only way to a safe and peaceful future," it continued. She said TILF was also planning to target United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and vehicles. The J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building, home to the FBI headquarters, is seen on June 9, 2023, in Washington. "This was an incredible effort by our U.S. Attorneys' Offices and the FBI to ensure Americans can live in peace," Bondi wrote. Ashley Carnahan is a writer at Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A jury in Dedham, Massachusetts, convicted Brian Walshe of first-degree murder Monday morning in the 2023 killing of his wife, Ana Walshe, whose body was never found. The panel deliberated for around six hours before returning its decision. Walshe is expected to be sentenced on Wednesday to life in prison without the possibility of parole – the mandatory punishment for first-degree murder in Massachusetts. Walshe had no visible reaction when the verdict was read. Walshe was accused of killing his wife, Ana, on January 1, 2023, hours after ringing in the new year and with their three young children still in the house. Prosecutors said Walshe dismembered her body and disposed of her remains in area dumpsters near their home in Cohasset, Massachusetts. Before the trial, Walshe pleaded guilty to misleading police and illegally disposing of his wife's body, so he's expected to face additional prison time for those convictions. Walshe now faces up to 20 years for misleading police – an enhancement triggered by the murder conviction – and can be sentenced to another three years for pleading guilty to the illegal conveyance of a body. Norfolk County District Attorney Michael Morrissey thanked the jury for their work on “a very difficult case” and “an incredible effort” on the journey to a conviction in a news conference after the verdict. And this was the right answer,” Morrissey said. While the family of Ana Walshe hasn't publicly shared a statement following the verdict, her sister told Morrissey, “Justice has been served.” Walshe has denied killing his wife, ﻿and his attorneys have said he found her inexplicably dead in their bed that morning. Ana Walshe, 39, wasn't reported missing until January 4, 2023, when Brian Walshe called her employer in Washington, DC, where she worked and lived part time. The prosecution called about 50 witnesses over eight days, including two of Ana's close friends and others who described their interactions with her in the final days of her life. Walshe ultimately chose not to testify, and the defense rested its case without presenting any evidence. The commonwealth did not offer the jury a theory of how Walshe killed his wife, but prosecutors say it's fair to infer she met a violent death in her family home. During deliberations Friday, the jury sent a note asking to see a photo of Ana Walshe lying on a rug in the living room of their Cohasset home that prosecutors had submitted as trial evidence. Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Anne Yas in her closing argument pointed to that rug as evidence of the murder: Investigators recovered pieces of a rug from a dumpster at the apartment complex where Brian Walshe's mother lived. The rug was cut up and covered in Ana's blood, prosecutors say, with a piece of necklace stuck in the fibers. Prosecutors say Brian Walshe threw away that rug, which was covered in blood, and bought a new one at HomeGoods on January 2, 2023. Jury deliberations resume Monday in the Brian Walshe murder trial Prosecutors have suggested Walshe was motivated to kill his wife after learning of her monthslong affair with a man she met in DC. Walshe's defense team, however, says he panicked after discovering her dead in their bed, thinking no one would believe he had nothing to do with her death. And while defense attorney Larry Tipton argued there's no evidence Walshe knew about his wife's affair before her death, he acknowledged to the jury there's evidence he disposed of Ana's body and then lied to police about it. The defense strategy to admit Walshe disposed of his wife's body and then misled police could effectively take the sting out of the commonwealth's strongest evidence for a first-degree murder conviction, Boston defense attorney J.W. Brian Walshe is on trial for the murder of his wife Ana. During the commonwealth's case, the jury saw digital data revealing extensive internet searches made on Brian Walshe's devices about how to dispose of a body and how to clean up blood – searches his attorney admitted were “dark” and “troubling.” But there's no evidence Walshe planned to kill his wife, the defense attorney said – only evidence he reacted after her death. “Why is the man searching now if he had planned to kill his wife?” Tipton asked. That sentence is set to run concurrently with his prison time for the state case connected to his wife's death. Victim impact statements from Ana Walshe's family are expected to be read at Wednesday's sentencing.</p>

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? There's a reason dengue infections are also called “breakbone fever.” In severe cases, blood vessels begin to leak. And in the worst cases, that can lead to organ failure. More than 14 million people contracted dengue last year, and the real number is likely several times higher. While it remains most common in South Asia and Latin America, it's no longer just a tropical disease. Warming temperatures are pushing dengue into southern Europe and the United States. Last year, Texas saw its highest case count in two decades, including locally acquired infections, meaning the virus is now circulating here, not just arriving with travelers. The public health tools we have — the dengue vaccines, bed nets, fogging campaigns, public awareness to drain standing water — are all aimed at keeping mosquitos at bay and preventing infections in the first place. Once you're sick, the strategy is just supportive care and hope. A new antiviral pill for dengue called mosnodenvir showed promising results in early phase 2 trials. In a study where volunteers were deliberately exposed to dengue, roughly half of those who received the highest dose never got sick at all. For a field that has struggled for decades to find an effective antiviral, it's the clearest evidence yet that a drug can prevent dengue — and researchers believe the same pill could eventually treat people who are already infected. Last year J&J announced it would wind down its dengue antiviral work, with a “strategic reprioritization” of its research toward non-communicable diseases like cancer and obesity. What this means is that one of the most promising dengue drugs ever tested is now without a pharma sponsor, waiting for someone else to carry it forward. André Siqueira, who heads the dengue program at the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), said mosnodenvir is “very, very promising” and said he wants to see it pushed into further trials “as quickly as possible.” But why — if the drug shows much promise — would its maker walk away? J&J's exit isn't an outlier; it's part of a broader retreat from infectious disease research across the pharmaceutical industry, as companies shift toward drugs for wealthier markets: cancer, obesity, autoimmune disorders. Dengue already kills thousands every year, and it's getting worse. By 2080, climate models suggest, nearly 60 percent of the world's population could be living in areas where dengue spreads. To test whether mosnodenvir actually works, researchers did something uncommon: They deliberately infected people with dengue. Over the past three years, 31 volunteers in Baltimore and Vermont, in what's called a challenge trial, agreed to take a pill for several days and then get injected with a weakened dengue virus. It's a faster way to get answers than waiting for people to get sick naturally, but it requires volunteers willing to sign up for a controlled case of dengue. The other four had much lower levels of virus in their blood and milder symptoms than the placebo group, where everyone got sick. At lower doses, the drug delayed infection but didn't prevent it — a clear signal that the higher dose was doing something real. In 2023, J&J launched a trial across more than 30 sites in South America and Asia to test whether the drug could protect people in the same household who are at high risk of getting bitten by the same mosquitoes. Among 265 people who received the highest dose, not a single person developed symptomatic dengue. (This data hasn't been formally peer-reviewed yet, but it's posted publicly.) “It's a huge scientific breakthrough just doing the study,” she said, referring to the design of the challenge trial itself, which had never been done for a dengue antiviral before. For a disease with no approved treatment, this is as close to proof of concept as it gets. The trial proved that mosnodenvir can prevent infection, a first for any dengue drug. But prevention isn't what dengue doctors need most. What they need is a treatment, something to give patients who are already sick to keep them from getting worse. Prevention strategies have a ceiling; you can reduce mosquito populations, but you can't eliminate them, and warming temperatures keep pushing them into new territory. A drug that works after exposure would be the first tool that doesn't depend on stopping the mosquito first. Mosnodenvir works by blocking the virus from replicating, and, in theory, that should help whether you take it before you're infected or shortly after. As a global health reporter, this story felt grimly familiar. The things we pay attention to get solved, and so-called neglected tropical diseases have become something that just happens elsewhere. This line from a 2004 article captures this quite well: “Probably the worst thing that ever happened to malaria in poor nations was its eradication in rich ones.” I grew up in Mumbai, where dengue was a regular occurrence every monsoon season. But the disease isn't staying there anymore. It's spreading — into southern Europe, into the United States — and the question of who develops drugs for it is no longer someone else's problem. This is why antivirals have been so hard to develop for dengue. The window to intervene can be narrow, and for many patients, it's already closing by the time they show up. The scientists who developed mosnodenvir believe it could work as a treatment. The logic is in line with how antivirals for, say Covid, work, but this hypothesis hasn't been tested in humans. Treatment trials were planned in Singapore, but the Covid pandemic made them impossible. And some dengue strains already circulating in nature appear to be harder to treat with this type of drug. Mosnodenvir alone probably isn't a long-term solution, because, eventually, the virus might adapt. But that problem is a familiar one for drug makers. HIV and malaria both evolved resistance to early drugs, and the answer was combination therapy: multiple drugs that attack the virus in different ways, making it far harder to escape all of them at once. Over the past two decades, Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis, AstraZeneca, and other major drugmakers have all scaled back or abandoned infectious disease research, judging that these drugs simply couldn't compete with cancer and obesity blockbusters. “We will do all we can to make sure that mosnodenvir is further developed in clinical trials as soon as possible,” said Patrick Chaltin, who directs the university's drug discovery center. To do that, the university is working with the Wellcome Trust, a major global health funder, to find new partners and funding. In countries where dengue has always circulated — India, Brazil, the Philippines, Sri Lanka — people have learned to live around it, says Malavige. But dengue isn't locked in those places anymore.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For nine hours, students at Brown University crouched under desks and behind locked door, making panicked phone calls and sending “I love you” texts that felt dangerously close to goodbyes. An active shooter was on campus — and police were still searching for a suspect. By the time Brown's campus lockdown lifted at 5:40 a.m., two students were dead and nine others had been injured, according to the university. So far in 2025, there have been at least 391 mass shootings and 13,929 shooting deaths in the United States, according to the Gun Violence Archive. At the private university in Providence, Rhode Island, the nightmare began on a winter afternoon just two weeks before Christmas. Students were studying for finals at the library or taking exams. Others were attending review sessions, and some were hanging out with friends visiting the Ivy League campus when the first alert reached their phones at 4:22 p.m. “Urgent: There's an active shooter near Barus & Holley Engineering,” the alert read. Students should lock the doors, silence phones and hide until further notice, it said, adding to run and evacuate safely if you could. “FIGHT, as a last resort, take action to protect yourself,” the alert said. Ten more alerts would follow, reminding the community to stay sheltered in place and keep doors locked, letting students know where police were and which buildings were being evacuated, and, finally, telling them the shelter-in-place order had ended. Zoe Weissman was in middle school when she witnessed the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead. “I think the sadness will set in when we get all the victims identified and find out who we lost as a community,” Weissman told CNN. “But right now, I'm just angry that there are kids like me in this country who have had to go through this not once but twice.” Many were entering the engineering building at Barus and Holley where final exams and review sessions were underway. The session ended just after 4 p.m., a little later than planned. Oduro, who helps teach economics to undergraduates, was delivering closing remarks to his class and watching his students stand up to leave when the sound of gunfire cut through the room. “He came in, pointed the gun, and then screamed something,” Oduro recalled. “Then he just started shooting right after that.” One of his students was shot in the legs. There wasn't much space behind the desk, Oduro said. He estimated it to be about 10 feet long. It “felt like an eternity” before the gunfire stopped, Oduro said. He didn't lift his head until campus public safety officers entered the room and told them it was safe to leave. Sophia Holman was searching for a classroom to study in at the engineering building when she heard gunshots. At first, she thought it was sound from the school's woodshop, or an “experiment gone wrong,” she told CNN. She ran one block east and then called police. Police searched the engineering building but couldn't find any suspect. The figure's face, officials said, was obscured, and witnesses told police he may have been wearing a gray camouflage mask. An early alert from the university initially said police had a person in custody. Everyone in the library, he said, was “very on edge” as law enforcement cleared every classroom and patrolled the building. “It didn't seem real,” Schenker, a former CNN intern, said. About 160 students were in lockdown in the gym, according to Lydell Dyer, a Brown student and former CNN intern. Went to the third floor of our building. We had to turn off the lights, close the blinds, and then we sat there in silence and darkness for hours,” Dyer said. They were eventually moved to the school's track facility building, he said. “I was there until 3:30 in the morning until they finally found a way to get us a shuttle and get us back to our dorms,” Dyer said. At a Hampton Inn in Coventry, Rhode Island, unsuspecting visitors and travelers were jolted awake shortly before dawn. Law enforcement banged on one hotel door, ordering the man inside to open up, sources said. At least 20 officers — including local police, US marshals and FBI agents — filled the hotel corridors as they entered the room, CNN witnessed. Once inside, they asked where he had been that day and evening. “We have a warrant for your apartment,” one officer said. But late Sunday night, officials released the man. The evidence “points in a different direction,” said Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha. There are still a “lot of steps left to take” in the investigation, Rhode Island Gov. “After 30 years in law enforcement, there were a lot of twists and a lot of roads that I've walked down,” McKee said. “I can't tell you what direction it's going to take right now, but we're going to solve (this case).” By Sunday afternoon, not all victims' families had been notified, a delay made more painful by timing and distance, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said. Mia Tretta knows the cost of gun violence in ways few people ever should. A junior at Brown University, Tretta survived the 2019 Saugus High School shooting in Santa Clarita, California. Tretta was shot in the stomach and lives with lasting physical complications. When it came time to choose a college, Tretta deliberately sought out a campus that felt small, contained and safe, a place she believed might finally put distance between her and the violence that had already marked her life, she said. So, when her phone first buzzed with an alert warning of a shooter in Brown's engineering building, she initially dismissed it. “I didn't really think it was real,” she said. “It was just a really confusing time for everyone. I have friends who were stuck in basements of buildings and/or in the hallway of the library,” she said. The night, Tretta said, carried brutal familiarity and proof that survival offers no immunity. “Unfortunately,” she said, “gun violence doesn't care if you've already been shot in a school shooting.” Smiley noted the generational impact of such violence: “We have a generation of kids who have had to do active shooter trainings. “Unfortunately, that's just part of the society we live in today,” he said. His heart goes out to students who didn't make it out of the room or are in the hospital. “I haven't really had the chance to process things myself, but I just want to make sure everybody else is OK,” Oduro said.
