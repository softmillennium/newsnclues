            Former Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been found guilty on two national security charges and a lesser sedition charge, in a landmark two-year trial widely viewed as a measure of the city's shrinking freedoms under Beijing's rule.
    


            Self-made billionaire Lai, 78, is one of the highest-profile critics of Beijing charged under a sweeping security law imposed on the semi-autonomous city in 2020 following months of huge and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests.
    


            He founded Apple Daily, a fiercely pro-democracy tabloid newspaper known for its blistering broadsides against the Chinese Communist Party until its forced closure in 2021.
    


            Lai had pleaded not guilty to all charges, and now faces possible life in prison. Monday's verdict marks the end of a tumultuous legal saga that had drawn condemnation from supporters and foreign leaders around the world, including US President Donald Trump – who had once vowed to “get him out.”
    


            The imposition of the national security law has transformed Hong Kong, with authorities jailing dozens of political opponents, forcing civil society groups and outspoken media outlets to disband, and transforming the once-freewheeling city into one ruled by “patriots only.”
    


            Hong Kong and China's leaders say it has “restored stability” following the 2019 protests.
    


            Lai is a British citizen, and the UK government has previously called for his release.
    


            At a news conference in London on Monday, Lai's son, Sebastian, said he was “heartbroken” about his father's condition and called on the UK government to do more to secure his freedom.
    


            “Now it's time to put action behind words, and make my father's release a precondition to closer relationships with China,” Lai said. “Because how can you expect a fruitful relationship if they can't even put a 70-year-old man – who's in such ill health – on a plane and send him back home here in the UK where he belongs?”
    


            UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper on Monday condemned Lai's verdict as “politically motivated,” saying Beijing's national security law had been imposed to silence China's critics.
    


            In delivering their verdict, judges said there was “no doubt that (Lai) had harbored his resentment and hatred of the PRC (People's Republic of China) for many of his adult years.”
    


            They pointed to Lai's lobbying of US politicians during Trump's first term – much of it before the security law was enacted – as evidence of sedition and colluding with foreign forces, including his meetings with then-Vice President Mike Pence, then-State Secretary Mike Pompeo, and attempts to meet Trump himself.
    


            They also pointed to his WhatsApp messages with other pro-democracy activists and Apple Daily leaders, and a New York Times opinion piece he had written in May 2020 – in which he suggested ways to punish China for its repression of Hong Kong, such as revoking student visas for the children of government officials.
    


            His urging US officials to take actions against China in the name of helping the Hong Kong public “would be analogous to the situation where an American national asks for help from Russia to bring down the US Government under the guise of helping the State of California,” the judges said in their ruling.
    


            “We are satisfied that (Lai) was the mastermind of the conspiracies” laid out in all three charges, they concluded. They added that the evidence showed Lai's “only intent … was to seek the downfall of the (Chinese Communist Party).”
    


            The judges said they would announce the date of his sentencing at a later point. Collusion is punishable by life imprisonment under the security law.
    


            The judges had earlier warned everyone inside to maintain “absolute silence” as their verdict was read out.
    


            Lai appeared calm throughout, greeting his wife and son at the start with a wave. He did not respond when the verdict came down but took off his glasses and wiped his face before he was led out of the courtroom.
    


            Throughout his trial, prosecutors accused Lai of using his Apple Daily newspaper to call for sanctions against Hong Kong and China during the 2019 protests, and after the national security law was introduced.
    


            He was arrested under the law in late 2020, and has spent more than 1,800 days in a maximum-security prison, much of it in solitary confinement. In 2022, he was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison on unrelated charges of fraud.
    


            Lai's supporters – many of whom had stood in line overnight to secure a seat inside the courtroom – expressed dismay but not surprise at the verdict, with many saying they no longer held faith in Hong Kong's judicial system.
    


            “I've got no anticipation (that) Jimmy Lai will be released,” one woman told CNN, describing the city's transformation as “too sad.”
    


            Another supporter said he, too, had held no hope for Lai's release, and described feeling numb to Beijing's crackdown on the city. But, he said, “We're still here … You can't really arrest us all.”
    


            Both supporters asked not to be named.
    


            Lai was born in mainland China and arrived in British-ruled Hong Kong at 12 years old, working his way up from factory laborer to clothing tycoon.
    


            He then pivoted to media and founded Apple Daily in 1995, two years before Hong Kong was handed over to China. The outspoken publisher and his newspaper were at the forefront of the city's pro-democracy movement.
    


            A vocal supporter of Trump, Lai traveled to Washington at the height of the 2019 protests, meeting with Pence and other US politicians to discuss the situation.
    


            At the time, massive demonstrations sparked by a controversial piece of legislation were drawing hundreds of thousands onto the streets – many of whom feared that Beijing could encroach on the city's autonomy and rare freedoms of speech, press and assembly.
    


Trump has vowed to free Jimmy Lai. A Hong Kong court is about to decide the media mogul's fate



            “Mr. President, you're the only one who can save us,” Lai said in an interview with CNN in 2020 weeks before he was arrested, addressing Trump. “If you save us, you can stop China's aggressions. You can also save the world.”
    


            Taking the stand in his own defense during the trial, Lai said he had never spoken with Trump.
    


            Trump had raised Lai's case when he met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, an administration official told CNN. The official added that Trump believes Lai should be released and wants to see that happen.
    


            Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997, has a separate judicial system to that of mainland China.
    


            Both the Chinese Embassy in Washington and the Hong Kong government have warned against “external forces” interfering with internal affairs and judicial process.
    


            Following Lai's conviction, China's foreign ministry said the central government “firmly supports (Hong Kong) in safeguarding national security and punishing crimes endangering national security in accordance with the law.”
    


            In a separate statement on Friday, responding to a US congressional committee report on China's human rights record, which included criticism of Lai's imprisonment and treatment, the Hong Kong government accused US officials of trying to “interfere with the judicial proceedings in (Hong Kong) by means of political power in order to procure a defendant's evasion of the criminal justice process.”
    


            Critics fear the national security law has brought Beijing's authoritarian and opaque judicial norms to Hong Kong, with all national security trials so far heard by a panel of specially selected judges, not juries – a departure from the city's common-law tradition.
    


            The final stretch of the trial was marked by health concerns for Lai. His lawyers told the court that Lai had been experiencing palpitations and episodes of light-headedness; his son Sebastien said at the time he was deeply concerned about his father's deteriorating health, including his old age and diabetes.
    


            In an opinion piece in The Washington Post last Tuesday, his daughter Claire Lai wrote that “solitary confinement is taking its toll on his body,” and claimed the family had little knowledge what medical care he was receiving as no outside physicians were allowed to examine her father.
    


            In its statement on Friday, the Hong Kong government said Lai had received “adequate and comprehensive” medical services while in custody, and the prison had arranged “daily medical checkups” for Lai. There had been “no complaints at all regarding the medical services he was receiving,” it said.
    


            It added that he had been placed in solitary confinement “at his own request.”

Live Updates


            • Death toll rises: At least 15 people have been killed and 27 are in hospitals after a shooting at Sydney's Bondi Beach yesterday. The attack, declared a terrorist incident, targeted Jewish Australians and is the country's worst mass shooting in almost 30 years.
    


            • The victims: Those killed were aged between 10 and 87.  A Holocaust survivor, as well as two rabbis are among the victims. A “heroic” bystander who wrestled the gun from one attacker is recovering in the hospital.
    


            • The suspects: The father-son duo were identified as 50-year-old Sajid Akram, who moved to the country in 1998 and was killed at the scene, and 24-year-old Naveed Akram, who was born in Australia and is in custody. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said they were “driven” by extreme ideology, and were interviewed by security services in 2019 but “weren't part of a wider cell.”



• Gun laws: Albanese announced Australia's plans to strengthen its already tough gun laws with new measures that will restrict who gets a license.
    


            It's the early hours of Tuesday morning in Sydney, and we are tracking the latest developments on the Bondi Beach shooting as the city begins to wake up.
    


For those just joining us, here's what we've been covering on the terror attack today:



Victims named: The identities of some of those who were killed in Sunday's attack have been released. Among the 15 killed are a 10-year-old girl named Matilda and a Holocaust survivor, as well as two rabbis and at least two foreign nationals.



Injured in hospital: At least 27 people are in hospitals following the attack, including a police officer who is in serious but stable condition and a bystander who wrestled a gun from one of the alleged attackers. Ahmed al Ahmed was described as a “real-life hero” by New South Wales Premier Chris Minns.
    


The suspects: A 50-year-old man and his 24-year-old son have been named by Australian media as the suspected perpetrators of the attack. Sajid Akram, the father, was killed at the scene, while Naveed Akram is in custody. Australian authorities believe the suspects “weren't part of a wider cell,” helping them to evade detection, though they were interviewed by security services in 2019, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told public broadcaster ABC.
    


The reaction: Tributes to those impacted by the shooting have come from around the world. People have left flowers and candles at a memorial near the site of the shooting, while money has been raised for the “heroic” bystander. Pope Leo also called for an end to antisemitic violence in a post on X.
    


CNN's Helen Regan, Kunal Seghal, Issy Ronald, Sandi Sidhu, Todd Symons, Lex Harvey and Billy Stockwell contributed to this reporting.



            A man who has the same name as one of the suspected Bondi Beach shooters has released a video urging people not to share his information in relation to the attack.
    


            Naveed Akram, a Pakistani man who lives in Sydney, said that pictures of him have been circulated online claiming that he is the shooter.
    


                    “I have nothing to do with that incident or with that person. That is a different person, and I am completely outside of this matter,” he said in a video posted to Facebook by the Pakistan Consulate General in Sydney.
                





            “This issue is very serious, and I'm very stressed and scared about this, and I cannot even go outside safely. So I just want everyone's help, to help me stop this propaganda,” Akram said, calling on the public to report any social media posts accusing him of being the shooter.
    


            Among the victims of yesterday's fatal shooting at Sydney's Bondi Beach were two rabbis: Rabbi Eli Schlanger and Rabbi ​Yaakov Levitan, both of whom worked at the Chabad of Bondi.
    


            Schlanger was a key organizer of the “Chanukah by the Sea” event at Bondi Beach and served as assistant rabbi at the Chabad of Bondi, according to the Jewish organization.
    


            Aged 41, he had five children, including a baby boy born just two months ago, Chabad said.
    


            Born in London, Schlanger studied in France before being ordained as a rabbi in Brooklyn, New York City, the organization said.
    


            As well as working as an assistant rabbi, he also served as a community chaplain in hospitals and prisons, “working tirelessly to bring warmth, faith, and Jewish pride to everyone he encountered,” a crowdfunding page endorsed by Chabad and dedicated to Schlanger said.
    


            “I remember him as passionate, energetic, he was a happy personality,” Rabbi Zalmy Fogelman, a rabbi who studied with Schlanger, told Chabad.
    


            Schlanger will be laid to rest in Jerusalem, Chabad said.
    


            Levitan was a “profoundly beloved and active member of the Sydney Jewish community,” according to a crowdfunding page endorsed by Chabad.
    


            A husband and father, Levitan was the “cornerstone of his family,” the crowdfunding page said, calling him a “a man of quiet devotion, known for his kindness and tireless work in assisting others.”
    


            As well as serving as general manager at the Chabad of Bondi, he was also a secretary at the Sydney Beth Din, which Chabad describes as a Jewish court of law. Levitan was a “key figure” in educational initiatives at BINA, an organization which describes itself as a “Jewish center of learning,” according to the crowdfunding page.
    


            More than 1.4 million Australian dollars (around $950,000 US dollars) has been donated to a GoFundMe page in support of the bystander who wrestled a gun from one of the alleged attackers during the mass shooting at Sydney's Bondi Beach.
    


                    “After witnessing the extraordinary actions of the hero who helped disarm one of the attackers during the Bondi tragedy, an act that prevented the loss of countless more lives, we felt compelled to act,” the fundraiser's organizers said in a statement posted on the crowdfunding platform.
                





            Earlier Monday, the bystander was identified as Ahmed al Ahmed, whose refugee parents had just arrived from Syria, according to Australian officials and media.
    


            Fundraiser organisers said the campaign was launched to “honour this absolute hero and help support him through recovery.”
    


            GoFundMe confirmed to CNN on Monday that it was working “directly with the fundraiser organizers to help ensure funds raised safely reach Ahmed,” as well as his family.
    


                    “All funds remain held with payment processors during our verification process until we can make sure funds can be transferred safely to him,” GoFundMe said.
                





            More now from Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who spoke to public broadcaster ABC earlier on Monday. He rejected Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's accusation that recognizing a Palestinian state fuelled antisemitism following the deadly attack on Bondi Beach, which targeted a Jewish gathering.
    


            Asked about the criticism from Netanyahu, Albanese told ABC he did not see a link between the two events.
    


            “And overwhelmingly, most of the world recognizes a two-state solution as being the way forward in the Middle East,” Albanese added. His government recognized a Palestinian state in September, alongside several other countries like Britain, Canada and France.
    


For context: Jewish leaders had warned the Australian government about rising antisemitism for years. A report by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry found that there were 1,654 antisemitic incidents last year, a threefold annual increase since the October 7 attacks in 2023.
    


            Albanese appointed a Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism last year as well as an anti-Islamophobia envoy, to address retaliation against the Palestinian community and their supporters.
    


            Following the attack, Albanese said on Sunday his role was to “bring the nation together” in a “moment of national unity.”
    


            Mourners gathered today near the scene of yesterdays' fatal shooting at Bondi Beach, paying tribute to the victims of the attack.
    


            Flowers and candles were laid at the memorial site, with Israeli flags also among the tributes being left. A menorah was lit by Rabbi Levi Wolff at the scene.
    


            See some images below from the tribute:
    


            Long queues formed at a Sydney blood donation center today, as people showed up to support their community following yesterday's fatal Bondi Beach shooting.
    


            Around 40,000 people booked appointments to donate blood across Australia on Monday, the Australian Red Cross told CNN in an email – an increase of 30,000 appointments compared to a usual day.
    


            “This has been the biggest community response we've seen since the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009,” the Australian Red Cross told CNN, referencing a tragedy in the state of Victoria in southern Australia that claimed 173 lives.
    


            “I just want to donate blood because I felt super helpless at home just sitting and doing nothing and I felt that there was something that you have to do, so I just came here and here we are,” one woman waiting at the donation center told Australia's Seven Network
    


            “We just wanted to help, we just wanted to do something,” another woman told Seven Network. “It's the most minuscule thing that we can do to help,” she added.
    


            Antisemitism should have been taken seriously sooner, according to the Australian Jewish Association CEO.
    


            Speaking with CNN's Rosemary Church on “Newsroom” earlier, Robert Gregory described how grief has turned to anger toward the government in the wake of Sunday's deadly terror attack at Bondi Beach, as he said lawmakers have missed opportunities to tackle a reported rise in antisemitic sentiment in the country.
    


            “The government appointed a commissioner on antisemitism that's made some recommendations which have not been adopted yet,” Gregory explained, citing university campuses and media outlets as identified “hotspots” for antisemitism.
    


            He claimed that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's swift commitment to tighten gun laws is a “deflection” and will not implement meaningful change, which Gregory said must address the issue at its root.
    


            “We want the government to focus on fighting the root cause, fighting the incitement,” Gregory said, before adding that the protection of Jewish community buildings including children's nurseries must now be prioritized as the community is “bearing a very heavy burden.”
    


For context: In an address to the nation yesterday, Albanese condemned the attack and urged Australians to hold onto the “true character” of Australia. When asked by a journalist how his government is responding to reports of rising antisemitism in the country since October 7, 2023, he said, “Yes we have taken it seriously, and we've continued to act.”
    


            The proportion of Jewish people in Bondi Beach is 34 times the national average, census data shows.
    


            A total of 4,441 people in the area gave their religion as Judaism in the country's latest census, making up 13.6% of the Bondi Beach postcode's population. Across all of Australia, Jewish people make up just 0.4% of the population, or 99,956 people, the census said.
    


            An analysis of the census by the Jewish Communal Appeal (JCA) found that the majority of Jewish people in Australia live in either Melbourne or Sydney.
    


            According to the JCA analysis, Australia had the eight largest Jewish population in the world in 2021, with 0.8% of the estimated global Jewish population living in the country.
    


            Germany was also home to 0.8% of the world's Jewish population in 2021, the JCA said, with the majority of Jewish people living in either Israel or the United States.
    


            Pope Leo has posted about yesterday's Bondi Beach shooting on X, calling for an end to antisemitic violence and offering prayers for the victims of the attack.
    


            “Let us #PrayTogether for all those who suffer due to war and violence. Today I particularly wish to entrust to the Lord the victims of the terrorist massacre carried out yesterday in #Sydney against the Jewish community,” Leo said.
    


            “Enough with this antisemitic violence!” he continued. “Let us eliminate hatred from our hearts.”
    


            It has been more than a day since two men opened fire on Sydney's Bondi Beach, killing at least 15 people and injuring dozens more.
    


            Here's what we've learned about the fatal shooting so far today:
    


Victims identified: The names of some of those who were killed in the shooting are beginning to be released. A ten-year-old-girl, two rabbis, and a Holocaust survivor are among those who were killed, as well as a French national and a Slovak citizen.
    


Hero bystander: The man who was filmed tackling and disarming one of the attackers has been named as Ahmed al Ahmed. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns met with Ahmed in hospital, calling him a “real-life hero.”



Suspects named: The suspected perpetrators of the terror attack have been named by Australian media as 50-year-old Sajid Akram and his 24-year-old son Naveed Akram. The younger man was born in Australia while his father immigrated to the country in 1998, according to Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke.
    


Injured officers: The two police officers who were injured in the shooting are in a serious but stable condition, New South Wales (NSW) Police said today. One of the officers was named as Constable Scott Dyson. He had been attached to Eastern Suburbs Police Area Command for 18 months, according to NSW Police.
    


Tightening gun laws: Australia plans to strengthen its gun laws with new measures that will restrict who gets a license, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced earlier. Under the plan, only Australian citizens will be entitled to hold a gun license, with limits on the number of guns they can own and the type of firearms that can be bought.
    


CNN's Hilary Whiteman, Helen Regan, Sandi Sidhu, Todd Symons, Lex Harvey, Laura Sharman, Kunal Seghal and Issy Ronald contributed to this reporting.



            A rise in antisemitic attacks across Australia caused the Jewish community to fear a violent incident, according to the communications manager for the Australia Israel Jewish Affairs Council.
    


            Speaking to CNN's Audie Cornish, Dionne Taylor described Sunday's Bondi Beach event, which marked the first night of the Jewish festival Hanukkah, as a joyous celebration turned tragedy.
    


            “We are not surprised by last night's attack. We are shocked, but we are not surprised,” Taylor revealed, adding, “Every attack that has happened up until last night was the warning sign that last night was inevitable.”
    


            The Executive Council of Australian Jewry's record of antisemitic incidents shows that in 2024 there were 1,713 episodes of antisemitism recorded, up from 2023's 1,200 reports. Taylor said the rise has been clear since October 2023, when she said antisemitic acts of graffiti, hate speech, physical violence and arson attacks started to become more common, “And now, murder,” she added.
    


            Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told journalists at a conference on Monday that Australia is a nation committed to protecting its people, listing the criminalization of hate speech and a ban on the Nazi salute and other hate symbols, which could result in massive fines or imprisonment, among evidence for this.
    


            But Taylor claimed the measures have not been effectively implemented, “Our government has been particularly weak in enforcing any of the laws that they have,” she said, adding, “The Jewish community … has been calling out the government's weak leadership”
    


            Australian authorities believe the two men suspected of killing 15 people on Sydney's Bondi Beach “weren't part of a wider cell,” helping them to evade detection, though they were interviewed by security services in 2019, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told public broadcaster ABC.
    


As we've reported, the suspects have been named by Australian media as 50-year-old Sajid Akram and his 24-year-old son Naveed Akram, but Albanese did not name the father-son duo in his interview.
    


                    “There's no evidence that these people were part of a cell,” Albanese said, while underlining that they were motivated by an extremist, antisemitic ideology. “It's extreme perversion of Islam that has resulted in these catastrophic consequences,” Albanese added.
                





            Police made the assessment that the suspected duo acted alone based on searching two premises connected to them, since they have not been able to interview the surviving suspect who remains in hospital, Albanese said.
    


            The pair were known to security services, he said. The son was investigated for six months by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) in 2019 “because of his connections with two people who subsequently … went to jail,” but that investigation concluded there was “no evidence” he had been radicalized, Albanese said.
    


            The father was interviewed as part of that investigation, but also showed “no indication of any radicalization,” Albanese added. He said he did not know if authorities questioned whether the father possessed weapons at the time.
    


Some context: The father has held a firearms license since 2015, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told reporters at a separate news conference, adding that police “know very little about them.”
    


            One of the people killed in yesterday's shooting on Sydney's Bondi Beach was a Slovak citizen named Marika Pogány, according to the Slovak Jewish Association.
    


            Slovakia's President Peter Pellegrini also confirmed this, writing on X that a Slovak woman named Marika was among the victims of the “senseless, violent rampage.”
    


            Pogány was “active, smiley and humane,” the Slovak Jewish Association said in a statement on its official Facebook page. She was a close family friend of Slovakia's former President Zuzana Čaputová, who said she first met Pogány during a visit to the Auschwitz Nazi Concentration Camp.
    


                    “Only her mother and her uncle came back from Auschwitz. No other member of this prominent family from Rožňava survived. Sydney was a safe haven for her, away from fascism and communism,” Čaputová said in a statement posted on the organization's Facebook page.
                





            The former president said Pogány began visiting Slovakia every year following the 1989 Velvet Revolution, which saw the end of the communist regime in the then Czechoslovakia.
    


            Pogány was an “extraordinary woman who lived her life to the fullest,” Čaputová said. “In her last message to me, Marika said ‘Live is a fight, take it as it is'.”
    


            In his post on X, Pellegrini said that “it is terrifying to see how far sick, faceless hatred toward strangers can go — hatred fueled simply by differences in faith, skin color, origin, or orientation.” He offered his “heartfelt and sincere condolences to Marika's family and loved ones.”
    


            The two police officers who were injured in Sunday's Bondi Beach shooting are in a serious but stable condition, New South Wales Police said today.
    


            Constable Scott Dyson, one of the injured officers, had been attached to Eastern Suburbs Police Area Command for 18 months, NSW Police said. No further details have been released about the second injured officer.
    


            In a statement, the families of the injured officers offered their “thoughts to the loved ones of those who were killed and injured in the Bondi shooting tragedy.”
    


                    They also expressed their “heartfelt gratitude to all first responders who acted with courage, in particular the police officers and paramedics who responded. They also wish to thank their hospital team, and especially those in ICU.”
                





            In the statement, the families thanked the community for its support, but also asked for privacy while their loved ones “focus on recovery and healing.”
    


            Intelligence agencies are forced to make difficult decisions using limited resources, according to Levi West, an expert in the field of terrorism and counter terrorism who spoke to CNN.
    


            “There's a significant difference … between people who have been radicalized to use the language that we would usually use to refer to people who've adopted extremist positions, and people who are actually going to follow through and undertake something like what happened yesterday,” West told CNN's Polo Sandoval on Monday.
    


            West's comments followed news that the younger suspect in the deadly Bondi Beach attack, named by Australian media as Naveed Akram, came to the attention of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) in 2019.
    


            West explained the number of people who adopt extreme views outweigh those who risk committing violence, “and so the challenge for any intelligence service is always trying to sift between those who might … present with having … Islamic state ideology or Al Qaeda ideology or neo-Nazi ideology, and those who actually appear as if they're going to go and do something.”
    


            Akram, the 24-year-old currently in hospital suspected of orchestrating the attack which killed at least 15 people with his father, was investigated by ASIO in 2019 for an alleged proximity to other people on their radar. Despite a six month assessment, it was determined he was not an ongoing threat for engaging in violence, a decision revisited by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese during a news conference on Monday.
    


            “There's every possibility the assessment … he wasn't an imminent risk of violence was entirely accurate at the time,” West said before observing, “Counter-terrorism resources are a finite pie, and decisions have to be made about what to prioritize.”
    


            Ahmed al Ahmed, the bystander who wrestled a gun from one of the alleged attackers, has been pictured in hospital recovering from the gunshot wounds he sustained during the incident.
    


            The 43-year-old met with New South Wales Premier Chris Minns on Monday, who praised him as a “real-life hero” whose “incredible bravery no doubt saved countless lives when he disarmed a terrorist at enormous personal risk.”
    


            Ahmed, a father of two girls, was shot several times in the shoulder, his parents said, according to ABC.
    


            A man seen running toward one of the Bondi shooters in footage on social media has been identified by his lawyer as a Middle Eastern refugee and father of two.
    


            Lawyer Alison Battisson told CNN that her client, who lacks permanent legal status in Australia, hid behind a tree with a detective and waited for the shooter to reload. After the attacker was struck by police fire, he ran towards the shooter and kicked away his gun.
    


            She declined to give her client's name but identified him as “AB”.
    


            Footage circulating on social media showed Naveed Akram, the younger of the two shooters, firing repeatedly from a bridge and then dropping to the ground after being struck.
    


            AB, dressed in black, can then be seen approaching the downed shooter with his hands raised.
    


            “He ran towards the shooting, yelling for help,” Battisson, Director Principal for Human Rights for All and Heretic Law, told CNN after speaking with her client.
    


            “The government won't give him a permanent visa. He has no right to stay here, yet he still ran forward to assist the Australian community.”
    


            AB, whose pregnant wife and two children are Australian citizens, sprang into action when he arrived at Bondi Beach by taxi and heard gunshots erupt, Battisson said.
    


                    “He comes from a country where you know when there is gunfire,” Battisson said. “He just knew he needed to run towards it to help stop it.”
                





            AB approached the shooter on the bridge and took cover behind a pine tree with a detective, Battisson said.
    


                    “He worked his way to the stairs and when the shooter went down, he ran up the stairs,” she added. “The shooter was still holding his gun and he kicked the gun away.”
                





            Approaching the gunman, AB stepped into the line of police fire, according to Battisson who said it was not clear if the officers “knew the shooter was properly down.”
    


            “He kicked the gun away and it got a bit confusing as people thought he was the shooter so the police shot at him,” Battisson said.
    


            “Then the detective ran up and said ‘no, he's with me.'”
    


            CNN has contacted New South Wales Police for comment.
    


            The father and son duo suspected to have carried out the massacre at Sydney's Bondi Beach in which 15 people were killed have been named by Australian media as 50-year-old Sajid Akram and his 24-year-old son Naveed Akram.
    


            Public broadcaster ABC as well as 9News and 7News – both CNN affiliates – named the two Akrams, citing sources, as did the Sydney Morning Herald.
    


            New South Wales police declined to comment.
    


             Separately, an imam who provided Quran lessons to Naveed Akram at Sydney's Al Murad Institute told CNN he was able to identify the younger shooter from video of the attack as the man he had taught.
    


            Sheikh Adam Ismail said in statement that Akram had approached the center for lessons in 2019 seeking Quran recitation and Arabic language classes. He continued his lessons for a year.
    


            “I condemn this act of violence without any hesitation,” said Ismail in a video message. “What I find deeply ironic is that the very Quran he was learning to recite clearly states that taking one innocent life is like killing all of humanity. This makes it clear that what unfolded yesterday at (Bondi) is completely forbidden in Islam.”
    


                    “Not everyone who recites the Quran understands it or lives by its teachings, and sadly, this appears to be the case here,” he said.
                





            Ismail said he produced a video message to clarify his relationship with Naveed Akram after a photograph was circulated of them together from the Al Murad Institute in 2022.
    


            Australian authorities have yet to formally name the Akrams but they have given details about the two suspects in multiple briefings to the media.
    


            The younger man was born in Australia while his father, who was killed in an exchange of gunfire with police at the scene, had immigrated to the country in 1998, Home Affairs minister Tony Burke said on Monday.
    


Raids were conducted at properties linked to the pair on Monday, including a short-term rental address in the southwest suburb of Campsie which is believed to have been where the pair stayed in the lead up to the attack. Two firearms and several suitcases were taken from the property by police on Monday afternoon, according to CNN affiliate 9News.
    


            The 24-year-old is currently in hospital and is likely to face criminal charges linked to the shooting, police said on Monday.
    


            He had previously come to the attention of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) which spent six months assessing his links to other people on their radar in 2019.
    


            “The assessment was made that there was no indication of any ongoing threat or threat of him engaging in violence,” said Prime Minister Anthony Albanese during a news conference on Monday.
    


            Naveed's father Sajid Akram had arrived in Australia in 1998 on a student visa and later transferred to a partner visa in 2001.
    


            In the years since then, he had taken just three trips overseas, returning on a resident return visa each time, said Burke. Police have yet to officially name the pair and officials would not confirm Sajid Akram's country of origin.
    


            He had held a firearms license for about 10 years, according to police, who seized six guns he owned following the attacks.
    


                    “The father has held a firearms license since 2015. We are very much working through the background of both persons” said New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon. But he added that police “know very little about them.”
                





            “He met the eligibility criteria for a firearms license” and held a “recreational hunting license,” Lanyon said
    


            There are two types of hunting licenses, Lanyon said: the ability to hunt on a property or also as part of a hunting club — or “gun club” — which is the type of license the suspect held.
    


            A property connected to the men in the southwest suburb of Bonnyrigg, was also swarmed by police following the attack.
    


            Residents living nearby described CNN scenes of chaos and fear as officers swarmed their normally quiet street.
    


            Renato Padilla, who has been living in Bonnyrigg for more than 25 years, said the street quickly filled with police vehicles as authorities launched a raid on a nearby house believed to be connected to the attack.
    


CNN's Rhea Mogul, Hilary Whiteman & Helen Regan contributed reporting



            A 10-year-old girl, a Holocaust survivor and a young French national were among at least 15 people killed in the Bondi Beach attack on Sunday.
    


            The victims of Australia's worst mass shooting in almost 30 years are yet to officially be identified, but their families and friends are paying tribute to those they have lost.

Vladimir Zelensky's statement of Kiev's willingness to drop its much-discussed but unrequited aspirations to join NATO in exchange for Western security guarantees reads more like a belated acknowledgment of a reality that has existed for years, which is that Ukraine was never going to be admitted to the bloc in the first place.

Zelensky's “compromise” may also be little more than a semantic maneuver. Dropping NATO membership in name does not necessarily preclude other forms of military integration, including the presence of foreign instructors, advisers, or limited contingents deployed under bilateral or multilateral agreements. 

Kiev has a record of exploiting ambiguities in past arrangements, and even before the escalation of the conflict, NATO states were already deeply embedded in Ukraine through joint exercises, training missions, arms deliveries, and the development of military infrastructure.

Ukraine's courtship of NATO began shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Kiev joined the bloc's Partnership for Peace program in 1994, cooperating through joint exercises and political dialogue. 

The process culminated in NATO's 2008 Bucharest Summit, where the bloc declared that Ukraine and Georgia “will become members” at some point in the future. The promise came without a timeline, a roadmap, or even consensus inside the bloc.

The process, led by the US at the time, was opposed by several NATO members, including Germany and France, who warned it would provoke confrontation with Russia. Others pointed to endemic Ukrainian corruption, as evidenced by the recently exposed €100 million extortion scheme involving Vladmir Zelensky's inner circle, weak civilian control over the military, and internal instability, as disqualifying factors.

Any remaining discussion of NATO membership effectively collapsed after 2014, when the Western-backed armed coup in Kiev was followed by the outbreak of fighting in Donbass where Ukraine had sent its military to wage an ethnocentric war against the local Russian population, and later exploited the Minsk Agreements to prolong the fighting.

Ukraine found itself in a domestic conflict with unresolved territorial disputes, while its military lagged behind NATO standards. Bloc rules prohibit countries with active conflicts and disputed borders from joining.

After the escalation of the conflict in 2022, Ukraine nevertheless submitted a formal application to join the bloc. What followed was a prolonged exercise in political theater. Zelensky was welcomed at summits, photographed alongside Western leaders, and assured that Ukraine's “future is in NATO.” Yet the bloc repeatedly refused to offer even a provisional timeline. 

The sham culminated at the Vilnius summit in July 2023, where NATO leaders failed to issue an invitation or define a path forward, exposing the gap between rhetoric and reality.

Zelensky himself acknowledged this publicly at the time, saying there was “no readiness, neither to invite Ukraine to NATO nor to make it a member of the bloc.” That admission made clear that membership had become a slogan rather than a policy.

We value our allies. We value our shared security. And we always appreciate an open conversation.Ukraine will be represented at the NATO summit in Vilnius. Because it is about respect.But Ukraine also deserves respect. Now, on the way to Vilnius, we received signals that…



Western media are now portraying Zelensky's latest statement as a diplomatic breakthrough while in practice, it is a concession only in name. Kiev is giving up something it never had – and was never going to get.

Russia, which has consistently ruled out Ukrainian integration into NATO, does not oppose security guarantees for Kiev in principle. 

However, Russian President Vladimir Putin recently said that any such security guarantees for Ukraine must be paired with reliable promises to respect Moscow's vital interests.

Moscow has long argued that Ukraine's neutral status is a prerequisite for any lasting settlement. Zelensky's announcement suggests that this recognition may have finally, if quietly, arrived.

India has continued to take a firm stand on refusing to open up its market for US agricultural products in trade talks, government sources told RT on Monday.

New Delhi may consider importing a marginally higher quantity of US rice, as it would not materially impact Indian farmers, the sources said, discussing the latest round of trade negotiations between the two countries.

The Indian government, however, “remains unequivocal on agriculture,” arguing that it is directly tied to rural livelihoods and food security and cannot be opened to foreign competition under a trade pact, according to the sources.

India is willing to make commitments in defense, clean energy, and LNG, viewed as strategic and high-value sectors, they added.

A delegation led by Deputy US Trade Representative Rick Switzer visited India for trade negotiations last week. The trip was the second by US officials to India since Washington imposed a 25% reciprocal tariff and an additional 25% levy on New Delhi for the purchase of Russian oil.

India has dismissed criticism over its Russian oil imports and maintains its energy policy is driven by “national interest,” though it is also expanding trade with the US.

In November, India announced a major contract for sourcing liquified petroleum gas (LPG) from the US.

Though officials are optimistic about a trade pact, US President Donald Trump threatened additional sanctions earlier this month, accusing India of dumping rice into the US markets.

India has made its best offers so far to the US in ongoing trade talks, a top official told a Senate panel last week.



The US is India's largest export market, accounting for exports worth $52 billion in the first seven months of the current fiscal year.

NEW YORK, December 14. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has threatened Thailand and Cambodia with more duties if they do not stop hostilities, he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.

""I just used tariffs 10 minutes ago, just before you came, to settle the new inflammation that took place with Thailand and Cambodia,"" Trump said. ""And I told them, ‘If you have the war, not only am I going to break the trade deal we have, but I'm going to put tariffs on your country.'"" He added, ""Nobody can do that but me.""

The Wall Street Journal said the interview was recorded on Friday. Trump was apparently referring to telephone conversations earlier in the day with the Prime Ministers of Thailand and Cambodia, Anutin Charnvirakul and Hun Manet.

Trump said he was sure that the duties is an important tool in the foreign policy for his administration. As Trump said, it would be ""terrible"" for the US if the US Supreme Court declared some of the duties imposed by him illegal. However, the American leader assured that in this case he would find legal grounds for further duties. The U.S. Supreme Court continues to consider this issue.

Trump said on Friday that he had spoken by phone with the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia and that the two leaders agreed to cease hostilities within 24 hours and return to the implementation of peace agreements. However, after that fighting continued.

In October, the Prime Ministers of Cambodia and Thailand signed a joint declaration in Trump's presence on the sidelines of the 47th ASEAN Summit, which formulated further steps for a peaceful settlement of the border conflict. The parties said they commit to contribute to de-escalating tensions, restoring trust and mutually beneficial relations.

Armed clashes with the use of small arms took place along the Cambodian-Thai border on December 7. The Royal Thai Army said that Cambodian forces began shelling Thai positions in the border area in the early morning. The Thai Air Force responded by attacking Cambodia's military infrastructure. There was information about casualties among the military. The Russian embassies in both countries advised Russian tourists to refrain from visiting the border areas.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

BRUSSELS, December 15. /TASS/. EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas said that, now that Ukraine's membership in the North Atlantic Alliance is ""out of the question,"" the European Union would need to provide concrete security guarantees to the former Soviet republic.

""Now if this [Ukraine's NATO membership] is not in question, or this is out of the question, then we need to see what are the security guarantees that are tangible. They can't be papers, or promises, they have to be real troops, real capabilities,"" she explained to reporters in a doorstep interview ahead of an EU Foreign Ministers meeting.

Kallas reiterated that ""in the last 100 years, Russia has attacked at least 19 countries,"" a remark she has lately been using in any comment on Russia. Based on this, she claimed that ""the security guarantees are needed for all other members"" in the EU.

The EU foreign policy chief also called for enhancing efforts to provide military aid for Ukraine as she emphasized that the EU delivered on its promise to supply Kiev with 2 million artillery shells this year, without elaborating.

Earlier, Vladimir Medinsky, a Kremlin aide who chairs the Russian Military Historical Society, said, commenting on Kallas' remark about the ""19 countries"" allegedly attacked by Russia, that he is ready to personally give a detailed history lesson to the EU's chief diplomat.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, December 15. /TASS/. Russia welcomes the decision of the General Assembly of the International Chess Federation (FIDE) to allow Russian chess players to compete at international tournaments under the national flag and to the tune of the country's anthem, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

""We welcome the decision of the General Assembly of the International Chess Federation to allow our athletes and our chess teams to participate in international competitions under the national flag and anthem. We deeply appreciate this decision made following the vote of the General Assembly,"" Peskov, who is also the chairman of the Russian Chess Federation's (RCF) Board of Trustees, told journalists.

""We believe that it was the right step towards the depoliticization of sports, especially in such field as chess,"" he continued.

""And we hope that this decision of the international federation reflects it in full. Other interpretations of fair voting may only provoke our disappointment,"" Peskov added.

On February 28, 2022, FIDE announced that chess players from Russia and Belarus would be allowed to participate in international competitions under a neutral status, adding, however, that the federation had barred both countries from hosting official chess competitions.

On March 16, 2022, the world governing body of chess barred teams representing Russia and Belarus from all international competition.

On June 7, 2024, the FIDE Ethics Commission ruled to suspend the membership of the Russian Chess Federation (RCF) with the global federation for the two-year period because the RCF included as its members chess associations from the country's new territories.

On June 26, 2024, Russia's governing chess body filed an appeal against the decision of the FIDE Ethics Commission and requested a complete overhaul of the Ethics Commission, as well as the return of the flag and anthem to Russian athletes.

On September 13, 2024, the Appeals Chamber of the FIA Ethics Commission overturned the body's earlier decision to revoke the RCF's membership, upholding the appeal of the Russian Chess Federation.

In July, 2025, FIDE allowed the Russian women's national team to participate in the World Team Championship under the FIDE banner while the European Chess Union (ECU) opposed this decision. The Russian team eventually won the tournament.

On December 14, 2025, FIDE ruled that ""youth athletes with a Russian or Belarusian passport should no longer be restricted in their access to international youth competitions, in both individual and team sports… In addition, the standard protocols of the IF [International Federations] or the International Sports Event Organizer regarding flags, anthems, uniforms and other elements should apply, provided that the national sports organization concerned is in good standing."".","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Representative says her son was let go once he showed ID as Trump ramps up operation targeting Somali population in Minneapolis

Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar told a Minneapolis broadcaster that her son had been stopped over the weekend by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, after Donald Trump ordered an operation targeting the Minnesota city's Somali population.

“Yesterday, after he made a stop at Target, he did get pulled over by [ICE] agents, and once he was able to produce his passport ID, they did let him go,” Omar said on Sunday in an interview with WCCO.

She added that her son, who she did not name, had earlier been praying at a mosque when ICE agents arrived and entered, before leaving without incident. She noted that he “always carries” his passport with him.

Following that encounter, Omar said she told her son, “just how worried I am, because all of these areas that they are talking about are areas where he could possibly find himself in and they are racially profiling, they are looking for young men who look Somali that they think are undocumented.”

Omar, who has represented Minnesota's largest city in the House of Representatives since 2019, is the first Somali American congresswoman, and a frequent target of attacks from Trump and his allies.

The president recently went on a racist rant against Somalis, calling them “garbage” and saying Omar “should be thrown the hell out of our country”. Omar was born in Somalia but became a US citizen in 2000.

The Trump administration has deployed immigration agents to Minnesota's Twin Cities area to target undocumented Somalis and Latinos. Last week, Omar sent a letter to Kristi Noem, the US homeland security secretary, and Todd Lyons, the acting ICE director, saying the enforcement, dubbed “Operation Metro Surge”, has resulted in “blatant racial profiling, an egregious level of unnecessary force, and activity that appears designed for social media rather than befitting a law enforcement agency.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Tributes paid to two people killed as authorities search for a gunman who also injured nine others in Providence, Rhode Island, on Saturday

Two victims named in Brown University shooting as police continue search for killer

The two people killed in Saturday's shooting have been identified as Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov and Ella Cook, according to reports.

Aspiring neurosurgeon Umurzokov was identified by his family in a Gofundme page. In a message on the site, they said: “He was incredibly kind, funny, and smart. He had big dreams of becoming a neurosurgeon and helping people. He continues to be my family's biggest role model in all aspects.

“He always lent a helping hand to anyone in need without hesitation, and was the most kind-hearted person our family knew. Our family is incredibly devastated by this loss.”

The Gofundme appeal had raised nearly $230,000 by Monday morning.

The Providence Journal reports that Cook's death was announced during a service at the Cathedral Church of the Advent in Birmingham, Alabama, where she was reportedly a parishioner. The Rev Craig Smalley said in livestreamed remarks: “Many of you heard about the tragedy ... And sadly, tragically, one of those people is one of our parishioners.”

Smalley said Cook was a “bright light”, “incredibly grounded and generous and faithful”.

We are going to be taking a brief break in this blog while we await more updates, as authorities continue to search for the gunman who killed two students and injured nine others.

Here is a quick summary of the latest:

On Sunday night, officials said that the hunt for the gunman was continuing and announced that they were releasing a person of interest that had been detained in connection with the shooting.

The Providence Police also said that since the first call to 911, they have “not received any specific threats to our community.”

One of the victims fatally shot has been identified as Ella Cook. She was identified as one of the victims during a church service at the Cathedral Church of the Advent in Birmingham, Alabama, where the Reverend said she attended.

Both Alabama Senators paid tribute to Cook, as did Martin Bertao, the president of the College Republicans of America, who said that Cook was the vice President of the Brown College Republicans

Another victim was named as MuhammadAziz Umurzakov, from Uzbekistan. Umurzokov was identified by his family in a Gofundme page. They described him as “incredibly kind, funny, and smart. He had big dreams of becoming a neurosurgeon and helping people. He continues to be my family's biggest role model in all aspects.”

The US ambassador to Uzbekistan also paid tribute to Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, as did Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin and Virginia's governor-elect Abigail Spanberger.

Brown University announced that it was temporarily delaying the release of admissions decisions for applicants who were meant to find out whether they had been admitted to the school today.

On Sunday, Brown University said that the school had cancelled “all remaining in-person exams” for Fall 2025 courses in the wake of the shooting.

FBI director, Kash Patel, said on Sunday that the FBI had activated its “cellular analysis survey team to provide critical geolocation capabilities” to aid with the investigation.

The University of Rhode Island said that it will not hold in person exams today.

As the investigation continues, authorities in Rhode Island have asked “anyone with relevant information, including video or photo evidence, to submit it by phone or through the FBI tip line”.

Michelle R Smith reporting from Providence, Rhode Island:

Tensions ran high in Providence on Monday near the Brown University campus, after authorities said they were still searching for a suspect and would release a person of interest they detained over the weekend.

In midmorning, sirens could be heard racing through the city's East Side, where Brown is located. Police later said in a post on X that they responded to a call of shots fired at an apartment complex a few blocks from Brown's campus. Police said the reports were unfounded: the loud noise came from a boiler backfire in the building. But they said they set up a perimeter around the area and cleared the building as a precaution.

Meanwhile, all Providence public schools were open with what the district told parents would be an increased safety presence, while many private schools in the neighborhood closed.

Foot and car traffic in the area around Brown was notably diminished from a typical Monday in early December, and a news helicopter circled the neighborhood all morning.

US Representative Seth Magaziner, a Democrat of Rhode Island, who is an alumni of Brown University, told MS NOW that people in Providence are feeling “shocked” “sad and upset”. 

“The last couple of days, people have really been stepping up to look out for each other” Magaziner said. “Rhode Island's a small state, providence is a small, tight-knit city. It's a place where people help each other and grieve together. This is also a place where things like this do not happen often. “

“Prior to the terrible shooting at Brown, there had only been two homicides in the city of Providence all year, and so I think the mood here is that people are feeling shocked, people are sad and upset” the Congressman added. “But more than anything else, I think people are looking out for each other.”

Magaziner said that he spoke with the director of the Rhode Island Blood Center, who told him that Sunday was the busiest day the center had had “since 9/11” because “so many people had turned out to donate blood”.

Magaziner said now that authorities do not have anyone in custody, “everyone's concerned and people are taking precautions, some schools in the area have been shut down, for example.”

He said that he knows that the authorities and police are going to “work around the clock as hard as they can for as long as it takes until they find this guy.'

Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin said on social media that he was praying “for the victims of the horrendous act of evil at Brown University”.

“Ella Cook from Birmingham, Alabama, and Midlothian High School's own Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov” he wrote. “We lift up their families, friends and communities in a prayer of comfort and peace.”

Virginia's governor-elect Abigail Spanberger has also paid tribute to one of the two shooting victims, Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov.

“I am heartbroken to learn that Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov — who just graduated from Midlothian High School — is among the victims of the horrific act of violence at Brown University” Spanberger said on X. “Adam and I are praying for his family and all those impacted by this tragedy.”

On Sunday, Brown University President Christina Paxson said that in addition to the two students who were killed in the shooting, seven students were in critical but stable condition, one student remained in critical condition, and said that one student was treated on Saturday and released.

“Our prayers continue to be with them and their families” Paxson said on Sunday. “We have reached out to the families of all the hospitalized shooting victims and are offering any support we can. I have spoken to some of the families and expect to speak to others soon. Our hearts go out to all of them, and we stand ready to give them anything they need.”

Jack Reed, Democratic senator of Rhode Island, said that the shooting has “touched everyone in Rhode Island, particularly our law enforcement officers”.  He added that the officers will “not rest until they have brought this individual to justice, and they are working overtime, triple time to get the job done”.

In an interview with CNN on Monday, Reed said that “as the mayor has indicated, he's doing an excellent job, along with state officials and all of our law enforcement personnel, they have gathered a great deal of information.”

Reed said that authorities had thought that the evidence “pointed towards the individual they took into custody” but that then, “they were able, I think appropriately, to determine that was not accurate” he said. “But they are relentless.”

“I think we'll get there,” he added, “but this is a disappointing setback. What they've done is determined that shelter in place is not necessary, but they've intensified police operations in the city, particularly around the campus.”

The mayor of Providence conceded on Monday that the release of the person of interest arrested a day earlier in connection with the Brown University shooting was a “setback”.

But Brett Smiley stressed the investigation had proceeded “at full speed” while the person was in custody, and repeated his belief that there was no threat to the community even while the gunman remained at large.

The Democrat was speaking on CNN, where he said investigators were “running down tips that have come in [and] leads that have been developed”.

Smiley said: “I want to be clear that while we certainly were focused on processing evidence for the person of interest who was detained, that didn't mean that the other pieces of the investigation were stopped or in any way paused.

“Obviously we're disappointed that the person needed to be released because of the evidence that had been examined, and it's a setback, to be clear. Those frustrations, I'm sure, are being felt by more than just me.”

Smiley said the lack of a “credible or specific threat” since the shooting at about 4pm on Saturday assured him that there was no further threat to public safety.

He said several “false” calls were received, but “we believe it is safe and appropriate for residents in Providence to be sending their kids to school today, and to be out in the community”.

“The setback is not necessarily in terms of the investigation. Other aspects of the investigation remain at full speed,” he said.

He said it was “an emotional letdown” to release the person: “The 24 hours where we thought we had a person of interest that might lead to something more concrete… [it] turns out that we've got a lot more work to do.”

As the investigation continues, authorities in Rhode Island are asking “anyone with relevant information, including video or photo evidence, to submit it by phone or through the FBI tip line”.

Alabama senators have paid tribute to Ella Cook, one of the victims of the shooting, who was from Alabama.

“I am heartbroken to hear that Mountain Brook's Ella Cook was among those killed over the weekend at Brown University” Senator Tommy Tuberville said. “Our hearts and our prayers are with the Cook family and everyone impacted by this senseless killing.”

In another post, Senator Katie Britt said that she joins the “Mountain Brook community and all of Alabama in mourning the heartbreaking loss of one of our own, Ella Cook, who was senselessly killed over the weekend on Brown University's campus.”

“There are no words that can ease the pain Ella's family and friends are enduring right now” she said.

The University of Rhode Island said that it will not hold in person exams today.

Online exams, the school said, will proceed as scheduled.

“Importantly, there is no known threat to our campuses” the university said. “This decision follows consideration of concerns shared by members of our community.”

Providence mayor Brett Smiley appeared on Good Morning America this morning, and said that after authorities reviewed the evidence in the case, it was “determined that this person of interest needed to be released”.

“We continue with our investigation” Smiley said. “To be clear, we've never stopped our investigation. Providence police and our partners at the State Police, the FBI and others have continuously run down leads and worked this case beyond the person of interest who had been detained.”

“As you have seen many times, we do have a short small clip of video footage that we do believe is the person that we're looking for” he said. “And right now we don't have any evidence to suggest that it was more than that individual which has been seen in that video.”

The mayor said that there is currently enhanced police presence both on campus at Brown and throughout the city of Providence.

One of the victims killed in Saturday's shooting has been identified as student Ella Cook, who was from Alabama.

Her name was announced during a church service at the Cathedral Church of the Advent in Birmingham, Alabama, where the Reverend said she attended.

“Tragically, one of our parishioners, Ella Cook, was one of those who was killed yesterday,” Reverend Craig Smalley said during the service on Sunday, which was live streamed. “And those of you who knew her, those of you who know her, she was an incredible, grounded, faithful bright light.

“Not only here growing up here at the Advent in the myriad ways in which she served faithfully and the ways in which she encouraged and lift up those around her, but at Brown University she was an incredible light in that particular place,” Smalley said.

The New York Young Republican Club also put out a statement on Sunday expressing their “deepest condolences to the family of Ella Cook” who they said was “the Vice President of the College Republicans at Brown University.”

In another statement, Martin Bertao, the president of the College Republicans of America, said that “we are devastated to learn of the loss of our Brown College Republicans Vice President, Ella Cook.”

“Ella was known for her bold, brave, and kind heart as she served her chapter and her fellow classmates” they added.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reposted the College Republicans of America post, and wrote: “There are no words. Thinking of her family and friends, especially her parents. God please bless them.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Former House speaker, 85, expects woman to assume Oval Office this generation but concedes she may not live to see it

Nancy Pelosi, the outgoing congresswoman and former House speaker, has conceded that she may not see a woman be elected US president in her lifetime.

The California Democrat said as much in a USA Today interview published on Sunday with her retirement looming after four decades in Congress – and invoked a turn of phrase referring to a metaphorical barrier impeding advancement in a profession that often confronts women and racial minorities.

“It's not a glass ceiling. It's a marble ceiling,” Pelosi told the publication while discussing the defeats her party colleagues Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris respectively endured against Donald Trump in the 2016 and 2024 presidential elections – as well as institutional resistance she met during her own rise on Capitol Hill.

“I thought certainly the American people are far ahead of the Congress in terms of their acceptance or their enthusiasm for a woman to be president of the United States.”

She added: “I always thought that a woman would be president of the United States long before a woman would be speaker of the House.”

With that not occurring, USA Today reported that Pelosi had adjusted her timetable – and even “tempered” her optimism – for when a woman may assume the Oval Office.

“I think it's … maybe not in my lifetime,” Pelosi, who turns 86 in March, said to the outlet. But she made it a point to predict “within this next generation, there'll be a woman” serving as US president.

Pelosi's comments in some ways mirror ones delivered by former first lady Michelle Obama in November about whether the US could soon join its North American neighbors Mexico and Canada in having a female chief executive.

“Sadly, we ain't ready,” the attorney, author and wife of Barack Obama – the US president between 2009 and 2017 – said during a conversation posted on her YouTube page.

“That's why I'm like: ‘Don't look at me about running ‘cause you all are lying – you are not ready for a woman.' We got a lot of growing up to do and there's still … a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it.”

Nonetheless, Harris, the former US vice-president, has been leading or placing highly in polls of potential 2028 Democratic candidates for the White House. As Axios noted, she also expanded a tour promoting her 2024 campaign memoir 107 Days and appeared before the Democratic National Committee in moves interpreted by many as signs that she is potentially gearing up for another presidential run.

Pelosi joined Congress in 1988 to represent San Francisco. She won election to the post 20 times and was the first woman to serve as US House speaker, a role she held from 2007 to 2011 and 2019 to 2023.

In the USA Today interview, she revisited her role in convincing Joe Biden, her fellow Democrat and longtime political friend, to drop out of seeking re-election to the White House in 2024. She said she and Biden have not spoken ever since he shelved his 2024 campaign before Trump – whom he defeated four years earlier – won a second term.

“I'm saddened by it because I love him and I respect him,” Pelosi told USA Today of her estrangement from Biden. “But I respect his decision in that regard.”

Pelosi did say that she was grateful Biden issued a statement declaring her “the best speaker of the House in American history” when she announced in November that she would retire at the end of her final term in January 2027.

Of her decision to retire as an octogenarian, Pelosi said to the publication, “It was time. I mean – I've been ready for a while.”

Pelosi also reportedly said, with an exasperated tone, that she is commonly asked: “What are you going to do next?”

Pelosi told USA Today she mostly replies with something to the effect of: “I don't have to do anything – I'm old!”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

As the year comes to an end, economists at the IMF, the World Bank and several major research institutions have unveiled their assessments for this year and expectations for next year. 

The global economy has experienced a limited recovery so far this year, given lukewarm macroeconomic conditions, they said, forecasting that the world economy would expand by between 2.8 percent and 3.2 percent this year. 

Next year, global economic growth is set to slow from this year's pace due to prolonged geopolitical uncertainty, more trade protectionism and a tighter labor supply, the economists said. Still they predict next year's global economy to increase by 2.7 percent to 3.1 percent, benefiting mainly from artificial intelligence (AI) investments by governments and businesses around the world. 

The US, Europe and major Asian countries are expected to accelerate their construction of AI infrastructure, with capital investments in semiconductors, data centers, fiber optics, cloud equipment and energy systems, economists said, adding that global technology giants, especially major cloud service providers, are likely to further raise their capital expenditures, with AI outlays as the core equipment investment.

Most economists also believe that expansionary fiscal policies worldwide would lend support to the global economy next year. For example, fiscal spending in the US is expected to further expand under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, while many European countries would likely continue to increase their defense and energy budgets to support their economic activities and fend off Russia.

In Asia, the Chinese government is rolling out a 500 billion yuan (US$70.9 billion) initiative to promote tech-driven projects and urban renewal programs, while Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has pledged to adopt a relatively proactive fiscal policy to protect people's livelihoods and build a robust economy. Emerging markets such as Indonesia, India and Malaysia have also proposed tax cuts, infrastructure programs and government spending plans to boost domestic demand and employment, thereby driving regional economic growth.

Furthermore, the US Federal Reserve's accommodative monetary policy is projected to help the world economy maintain its uptrend, despite market volatility, economists said. The rationale is that US interest rate changes are more than just a domestic issue — they also influence global trade in many aspects, from the strength of the US dollar to global capital flows, and from the financing costs of international trade to shifts in economic strategies worldwide, they added.

As widely expected, the US central bank concluded its final monetary policy committee meeting of the year on Wednesday last week by delivering a third 25-basis-point reduction to its key policy rate. The market consensus is that the appointment of the next Fed chair, who would take over in May next year, is likely to lower borrowing costs further and at a quicker pace amid public pressure from the White House, regardless of whether US National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett or former Fed governor Kevin Warsh gets the position.

Against this backdrop, Taiwan's economy has so far delivered a strong performance despite headwinds from tariff uncertainties and foreign exchange volatility from US President Donald Trump's trade policy, thanks to the global AI boom, as well as local businesses pushing for digitalization and low-carbon transformation. 

The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics last month raised its GDP growth forecast for this year to 7.37 percent, the highest in 15 years. However, the nation's economy is expected to slow slightly next year compared with this year due to a high base effect. 

The agency also predicted a 3.58 percent growth on the back of solid momentum in exports and domestic investments. While a robust stock market and a stable labor market would help boost consumer spending, the increasing gap between tech and non-tech sectors warrants closer attention. Firms in some non-tech manufacturing, construction and service industries might face pressure from unpaid leaves or layoffs due to US tariffs and China's sluggish economy, which the government must respond to in a timely and effective manner.

In a speech at the event, Lai highlighted similarities in the geopolitical challenges faced by Israel and Taiwan, saying that the two countries “stand on the front line against authoritarianism.”
Lai noted how Taiwan had “immediately condemned” the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas and had provided humanitarian aid.
Lai was heavily criticized from some quarters for standing with AIPAC and Israel.

A person of interest detained after a Brown University shooting that killed two students and injured nine was to be released after law enforcement authorities determined there was no basis to keep the individual in custody, officials said on Sunday night.

The disclosure, made at a hastily convened late-night news conference, represents a dramatic setback in an investigation into killings that set off hours of chaos on the Ivy League campus and unravels progress that authorities thought they had made earlier in the day when they detained a man at a Rhode Island hotel in connection with the attack.

The release of the lone person of interest leaves law enforcement without any known suspect, with officials pledging to redouble efforts in the investigation by canvassing for video surveillance that could help pinpoint the killer's identity.

“We have a murderer out there,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said, while Providence Mayor Brett Smiley acknowledged that ”the news is likely to cause fresh anxiety for our community.”

LOCKDOWN LIFTED

Despite an enhanced police presence at Brown, officials are not recommending another shelter-in-place order like the one that followed the Saturday afternoon shooting, when hundreds of officers searched for the shooter, and urged students and staff to shelter in place. The lockdown, which stretched into the night, was lifted early on Sunday, but authorities had not yet released information about a potential motive.

On Sunday morning, officials took into custody a person of interest at a Hampton Inn hotel in Coventry, Rhode Island, about 32km from Providence. Two people familiar with the matter identified that individual as a 24-year-old man from Wisconsin, though authorities never released the person's name.

“I've been around long enough to know that sometimes you head in one direction and then you have to regroup and go in another, and that's exactly what has happened over the last 24 hours or so,” Neronha said.

He said that “certainly there was some degree of evidence that pointed to the individual” who had been taken into custody, but “that evidence needed to be corroborated and confirmed, and over the last 24 hours leading into just very, very recently, that evidence now points in a different direction.”

The shooting occurred during one of the busiest moments of the academic calendar, as final exams were under way. Brown canceled all remaining classes, exams, papers and projects for the semester and told students they could leave campus, underscoring the scale of the disruption and the gravity of the attack.

As police scoured the area for the shooter, many students remained barricaded in rooms while others hid behind furniture and bookshelves. One video showed students in a library shaking and wincing, as they heard loud bangs just before police entered the room to clear the building.

MUTUAL SUPPORT

University president Christina Paxson teared up while describing her conversations with students both on campus and in the hospital.

“They are amazing and they're supporting each other,” she said at a news conference. “There's just a lot of gratitude.”

The gunman opened fire inside a classroom in the engineering building, firing more than 40 rounds from a 9mm handgun, a law enforcement official said.

Two handguns were recovered when the person of interest was taken into custody and authorities also found two loaded 30-round magazines, the official said. 

One of the firearms was equipped with a laser sight that projects a dot to aid in targeting, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.


PARLIAMENT CHAOS:

Bolsonaro has been serving a 27-year term since last month after his conviction for a scheme to stop Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office after the 2022 election.
Lawmakers had been discussing a bill that would significantly reduce sentences for several crimes, including attempting a coup d'etat — opening up the prospect that Bolsonaro, 70, could have his sentence cut to

Dense toxic smog yesterday blanketed India's national capital, pushing air pollution levels to their worst levels in weeks, disrupting travel and causing authorities to impose the strictest containment measures.

More than 40 flights were canceled and several dozens delayed. More than 50 trains arriving and departing from New Delhi were delayed by several hours, authorities said.

Healthcare experts warned residents to avoid all outdoor activities, as hospitals reported an influx of patients with breathing difficulties and eye irritation.

“New Delhi is a gas chamber right now. Air purifiers can help only a bit, so it's high time the government comes up with some permanent solutions,” said Naresh Dang, a physician at Max Healthcare.

Delhi's air pollution levels have remained at what the federal government calls a “severe” level for the past two days, which the government says can cause respiratory effects on healthy people and seriously affect the health of people with heart or lung disease.

On Sunday, official index readings were over 450 at several monitoring stations, up from 430 on Saturday and the highest so far this winter season, as per data from Central Pollution Control Board. Yesterday, it stood at 449. Readings below 50 are considered good. 

During periods of severe air pollution, the government advises people to avoid going outdoors as much as possible and wear N95 masks when going outside. 

Children, pregnant women, elderly people and those with pre-existing respiratory or cardiovascular conditions are at higher risk and officials advise them to be extra cautious.

“I have never seen this kind of pollution ever. Last year I came to Delhi, it was polluted. This year it is more polluted. I can feel the smoke while I breathe the air,” said Tiam Patel, a tourist.

To stem pollution, Indian authorities have banned construction activities and restricted use of diesel generators and cars. Water sprinklers have been deployed to control the haze. Schools and offices are allowing many students and workers to stay home.

However, environmentalists say that the country's air pollution crisis requires long-term changes.

New Delhi and its surrounding region, home to more than 30 million people, routinely rank among the world's most polluted. 

India has six of the world's 10 most polluted cities, and New Delhi is the most polluted national capital, a report from Switzerland-based air quality monitoring database IQAir earlier this year said.

Bolsonaro has been serving a 27-year term since last month after his conviction for a scheme to stop Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office after the 2022 election.
Lawmakers had been discussing a bill that would significantly reduce sentences for several crimes, including attempting a coup d'etat — opening up the prospect that Bolsonaro, 70, could have his sentence cut to

Beijing has raged at Tokyo since Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi last month said that a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Japan.
China and Japan have long sparred over their painful history. China consistently reminds its people of the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, in which it says Japanese troops killed 300,000 people in what was then its capital.

Less than one-tenth of Ukrainians support holding immediate elections, even in the absence of a ceasefire with Russia, according to a poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on Dec. 15.

Some 25% of respondents spoke in favor of holding elections if there is a ceasefire backed by security guarantees, while 57% said holding a vote would be possible only after a final peace agreement.

The news comes as the U.S. once again raised the issue of elections in Ukraine as Washington pushes to broker a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow by the end of the year.

Ukraine has not held presidential and parliamentary elections since 2019, as the Constitution prohibits holding the vote under martial law, which was declared at the outbreak of the full-scale Russian invasion.

The latest poll was conducted between Nov. 23 and Dec. 13 and was based on responses from 547 respondents living in Ukraine-held territories.

The scale of support for holding immediate elections, even without a ceasefire, has been largely consistent throughout the year, changing only slightly from 10% in March and 11% in September to 9% in December.

Compared with the spring, support for holding elections immediately after a ceasefire has grown, while the share of respondents who say a complete end to the war is a prerequisite has declined. 

In March, 9% of Ukrainians favored elections following a ceasefire, whereas 78% said a final peace agreement should come first.

Earlier in December, U.S. President Donald Trump mused in a meeting with reporters about ""how long is it going to be before they (Ukraine) have an election.""

""It's a democracy. It's been a long time,"" Trump said.

In an expected shift, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine could be ready to hold elections even during the war, provided that the U.S. and European allies ensure security.

The president added that he had discussed the issue with lawmakers and requested that parliament propose measures for holding elections during wartime.

The General Staff of Poland's Armed Forces confirmed on Dec. 10 that talks on transferring remaining Polish MiGs to Ukraine are ongoing, though Polish President Karol Nawrocki said a day later he had not been informed about the discussions.

Warsaw confirmed transferring 14 MiG-29 jets to Ukraine in the spring of 2023, being the first country to supply Kyiv with warplanes amid Russia's all-out invasion.

Ukraine's Air Force was also bolstered by additional MiG-29 jets provided by Slovakia the same year, as well as F-16 jets from the Netherlands and Denmark in 2024.

Poland has been a key ally of Ukraine during the full-scale war, providing significant military aid and serving as a hub for defense assistance flowing to the war-torn country.

Russia has indicated it's open to Ukraine joining the European Union as part of a potential peace deal aimed at ending Russia's war on Ukraine, and there's now consensus on about 90 per cent of the U.S.-authored peace plan, U.S. officials said Monday.

The officials said that robust negotiations between President Donald Trump's envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his team led to progress on narrowing differences on security guarantees Kyiv said must be provided to Ukraine as well as the contentious issue on Moscow's demand that Ukraine concede land in the eastern Donbas.

Kushner and Witkoff are expected to meet over dinner on Monday evening with Ukrainian as well British, German and French leaders for further talks. Trump, who has been briefed twice on the Berlin talks, plans to dial in to the dinner from Washington.

The negotiators and others involved in the peace talks will likely meet in Miami or elsewhere in the United States this weekend to continue their work, according to the U.S. officials.

The U.S. officials also said the administration plans to put forward the security guarantees agreement before the Senate for its approval, although they didn't specify whether it would be ratified like a treaty, which needs two-thirds approval from the chamber.

The U.S. officials who briefed reporters after Witkoff and Kushner met with Zelensky and other European officials in Berlin over the last two days said that such an offer over Ukraine joining the EU would be a major concession by Moscow. But Russia has previously said it does not object to Ukraine joining the EU.

The U.S. officials, who were not authorized to comment publicly by the White House and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the U.S. has also agreed to provide unspecified security guarantees to Kyiv as part of the deal but that such an offer won't be on the table “forever.”

The latest round of talks between Zelensky and U.S. envoys ended Monday as Kyiv faces Washington's pressure to swiftly accept a U.S.-brokered peace deal while confronting an increasingly assertive Moscow.

Ukraine's lead negotiator, Rustem Umerov, said on social media that “real progress” had been achieved at the talks in Berlin with President Donald Trump's special envoy Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Kushner as well as European officials. The talks lasted roughly 90 minutes, after a five-hour session Sunday.

The U.S. government said in a social media post on Witkoff's account after Sunday's meeting that “a lot of progress was made.”

The search for possible compromises has run into major obstacles, including control of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, which is mostly occupied by Russian forces.

Zelensky has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine's bid to join the NATO military alliance if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to NATO members. But Ukraine's preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression however this option doesn't currently have full backing from all allies.

Zelensky ditches NATO ambition as U.S. envoy Witkoff sees progress in peace talks

Still, Ukraine has continued to reject the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of Donetsk region still under its control as one of the key conditions for peace.

Zelensky's itinerary on Monday also included meetings with German and other European leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron's office confirmed he would travel to Berlin later Monday.

“The issue of security in particular will ultimately determine whether this war actually comes to a standstill and whether it flares up again,” a spokesperson for German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Stefan Kornelius, told reporters.

The Russian president has cast Ukraine's bid to join NATO as a major threat to Moscow's security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February, 2022. The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine renounce the bid for alliance membership as part of any prospective peace settlement.

Zelensky emphasized that any Western security assurances would need to be legally binding and supported by the U.S. Congress.

The Kremlin said Monday it expected to be updated on the Berlin talks by the U.S. side.

Asked whether the negotiations could be over by Christmas, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said trying to predict a potential time frame for a peace deal was a “thankless task.”

“I can only speak for the Russian side, for President Putin,” Peskov said. “He is open to peace, to a serious peace and serious decisions. He is absolutely not open to any tricks aimed at stalling for time.”

Putin has denied plans to attack any European allies.

In London, meanwhile, the new head of the MI6 spy agency was set to warn on Monday how Putin's determination to export chaos around the world is rewriting the rules of conflict and creating new security challenges.

Blaise Metreweli was using her first public speech as chief of the United Kingdom's foreign intelligence service to say that Britain faces increasingly unpredictable and interconnected threats, with emphasis on “aggressive, expansionist” Russia.

Michele Singer Reiner and Rob Reiner were found dead in their Los Angeles home on Sunday, officials said.KEVIN WOLF/AP

The son of filmmaker Rob Reiner was arrested on homicide charges after the director of beloved movies like When Harry Met Sally ... and his wife were found dead in their Los Angeles home, a police official said on Monday.

Nick Reiner was being held in a Los Angeles County jail on a US$4-million bond, according to jail records. An official with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department said he had been arrested on homicide charges.

Police said they found two bodies at the Reiners' home at 3:40 p.m. Pacific Time in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles on Sunday, whom they did not identify. Other officials confirmed the victims were Reiner, 78, and his wife Michele, 68.

Local media reported the couple had been stabbed to death. Nick Reiner spoke openly over the years about his struggles with substance abuse and about being homeless at times when he was on the run and refusing to go into rehab. He told People Magazine in a 2016 interview that he first went into rehab for drug abuse at age 15 – and that he eventually had at least 17 stays in rehab facilities over the years.

Rob and Nick Reiner co-wrote the film Being Charlie, based on Nick's experiences with heroin addiction and homelessness. “It was the most personal thing I've ever been involved in,” Rob Reiner told podcaster Marc Maron in 2016.

Nick told People, “when I was out there, I could've died.” Tributes poured in for Rob Reiner, who was active in politics, supporting liberal causes.

“This is a devastating loss for our city and our country. Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement.

As an actor, Reiner was best remembered for his role on the 1970s CBS television comedy hit All in the Family as Mike “Meathead” Stivic, the son-in-law and liberal foil of the lead character.

The role garnered Reiner two Emmy awards for outstanding supporting actor.

Reiner went on to have a prolific Hollywood career as a director, starting with This is Spinal Tap, a 1984 mockumentary about a fictional hard rock band. The film became a cult classic, known for its mostly improvised script, with Reiner playing the faux documentary filmmaker Marty DiBergi.

“That was the trick – to make fun of it and at the same time, honour it,” Reiner told CBS' 60 Minutes this year as he promoted a sequel, Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.

Reiner directed nearly two dozen films in all, including classics such as Stand by Me, a 1986 coming-of-age drama about four boys who set out to find the body of a missing youth, as well as 1989's When Harry Met Sally ..., often cited as one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time.

That movie featured the famed line, “I'll have what she's having,” delivered by the director's real-life mother, Estelle Reiner, reacting to a faked orgasm in a restaurant.

Reiner also directed the 1987 fairy-tale adventure The Princess Bride, the 1990 psychological thriller Misery, and the 1992 military courtroom drama A Few Good Men.

Michele Reiner was at one time a photographer who captured the image of Donald Trump that appears on the cover of his book Trump: The Art of the Deal. 

Rob Reiner, the son of the late comedy writer and actor Carl Reiner, also made campaign ads for 2004 Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry and campaigned against a 2008 California effort to ban same-sex marriages.

Prior to Nick Reiner's arrest, Trump said on social media that their deaths were “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.”

Reiner was first married to Penny Marshall, who starred in the TV sitcom Laverne & Shirley, and was also a producer and director. He was an adoptive father to Marshall's daughter and had three children with Michele Singer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","How the world's first global trader, Jakob Fugger, got rich","https://www.dw.com/en/how-the-worlds-first-global-trader-jakob-fugger-got-rich/a-75133701","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 10:45:03 GMT","

Some 500 years ago, Jakob Fugger was the richest man alive. The German financed emperors and popes, and reshaped global trade and banking to set the economic course for the modern world. 

For Greg Steinmetz, the Augsburg, Germany-born Jakob Fugger was ""the first person to conduct trade on a truly global scale.""

Steinmetz, a former correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, profiled Fugger in the 2015 biography The Richest Man Who Ever Lived.

Speaking with DW, Steinmetz said global commerce barely existed at the time, until German Emperor Charles V extended European control into South America during his reign as Holy Roman emperor and king of Spain in the 16th century.

There wasn't much of a globe to trade with, Steinmetz noted, apart from trade with India, and what is now Indonesia and China.

But merchants could only travel west after Columbus had discovered America in 1492, meaning ""only half the globe"" had been known to Europeans, and Fugger was ""at the beginning of that phenomenon"" later known as global trade.

Born into a prosperous Augsburg family whose wealth began with his grandfather, master weaver Hans Fugger, Jakob received his commercial training in Venice, Italy. The city not only shaped Jakob's taste for the Renaissance but also introduced him to a breakthrough that would accelerate his rise: double-entry bookkeeping.

Since there were no business schools back then, Steinmetz said, merchant families would ""send their boys out to become apprentices,"" and Germans heavily traded with Venice.

""He [Fugger] took all of those Venetian secrets, including double-entry bookkeeping, back to Germany with him. And he was the first in Germany to employ these modern methods,"" Steinmetz said.

With meticulous records, Fugger always knew where his finances stood — unlike many rivals. He also built an intelligence network of agents across major European cities and even small German towns.

""People would feed him with information, by courier and horses … so that he would know about things before his competitors did, and he could use that to his advantage. Information today is everything, and it was everything back then, too,"" Steinmetz said.

After his brothers died, Jakob Fugger took sole control of the family enterprise in 1510 and strengthened its ties to the Habsburg monarchy, lending aggressively to Emperors Maximilian I and Charles V.

In return, he secured access to lucrative silver and copper operations in Tyrol and what was then Hungary. He did not own the mines outright, but held rights and stakes that proved extraordinarily profitable.

Europe had little to offer Asia at the time besides precious metals. ""Europe wasn't exporting technology or luxury goods,"" Steinmetz explained. ""But it had silver, gold, and copper — and that's where Fugger became indispensable.""

Martin Kluger, CEO of the Context publishing house in Augsburg and Nuremberg, and also an author of several books on the Fugger family, said India — then technologically and economically ahead of Europe — suffered a chronic shortage of copper, which was a ""stroke of extremely good luck"" for the Fugger mining interests.

And timing amplified that advantage: ""Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route to India in 1498, just three years after the Fuggers moved into large-scale copper mining in Neusohl [today Banska Bystrica in Slovakia]. Demand soared, and the Fuggers held the supply,"" said Kluger.

Copper consumption was rising in Europe as well — in shipbuilding, weaponry, cookware and monumental architecture. Kluger noted that the Habsburgs and the Hungarian crown often repaid debts by granting mining rights because they lacked other means.

""The aristocracy's limited commercial knowledge worked in the Fuggers' favor,"" he added.

Fugger also ensured that powerful yet hugely indebted borrowers kept paying. His strategy, Steinmetz said, was to ""make himself indispensable.""

""Emperor Maximilian was constantly fighting wars and had to pay mercenaries. The only one who could come up with money when Maximilian needed it quickly was Fugger.""

Lars Börner, a German economic history expert, believes Fugger reshaped European finance because he persuaded the pope to relax the Catholic Church's ban on charging interest, which opened the door to modern lending practices.

""It's no secret that the pope also liked to pull in the highest returns possible. Interest ban or not,"" Börner recently told German public radio Deutschlandfunk.

In exchange, he said, Fugger shared in church revenues, including the controversial sale of indulgences used to fund St. Peter's Basilica in Rome — a practice that eventually sparked Protestant revolt, the Reformation.

Yet Fugger's most visible legacy is situated in his Bavarian hometown of Augsburg: the so-called Fuggerei, the world's first social housing complex, founded in 1521.

It still operates today, and like 500 years ago, residents pay only a nominal rent. Visitors from around the world tour the community, which remains a tangible symbol of his influence.

Historians estimate Fugger's total wealth at the equivalent of $300 billion to $400 billion today (€255 billion to €340 billion). In Fugger's time, this amounted to between 2% and 10% of the entire economic output of Europe — and well above the current wealth of Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos in comparison to the US gross domestic product.

While modern-day philanthropists such as Bill Gates work to shape their legacies through foundations, corporate historian Boris Gehlen told DW they are unlikely to match Fugger's long-term impact. ""Their legacy won't be as significant as Fugger's,"" he said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Berlin for talks with Germany's Friedrich Merz and other European allies. Meanwhile, Brussels continues a debate on reparations loans to Kyiv. Follow DW for more.

Continue reading for the main headlines from Russia's war in Ukraine on Monday, December 15.

Talks on ending Russia's war against Ukraine are continuing in Berlin and have not concluded with the joint press conference with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Afterwards, both men are set to attend a dinner with several European leaders.

Participants include British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Kyiv and Washington remain divided over territorial issues after two days of talks in Berlin on ending Russia's war.

Speaking to reporters after the talks in Berlin, Zelenskyy said, ""There has been sufficient dialogue on the territory, and I think that, frankly speaking, we still have different positions, but I believe that my colleagues have heard my personal position.""

He said the issue of territory remains painful but added he believes the United States will help Ukraine find a compromise. Zelenskyy said Ukraine is ready for fair work toward a strong peace agreement and that talks with US counterparts will continue.

Zelenskyy also said the United States is not making its own territorial demands on Ukraine. He said the US delegation had conveyed Russian demands and he stressed that Ukraine needs clear security guarantees before any decisions are made about front lines.

Earlier, Zelenskyy said negotiations with the US delegation would continue and repeated that while positions differ on territory, Ukraine remains committed to achieving a fair and lasting peace deal.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said diplomatic momentum on Ukraine has intensified, calling it possibly the strongest since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Speaking after talks in Berlin, Merz said there was now a real chance for a peace process, adding, ""This plant is still small, but the chance is real.""

Merz thanked US President Donald Trump, saying the progress would not have been possible without his engagement.

He said he was satisfied with talks in Berlin between US and Ukrainian representatives on ending Russia's war.

At a joint news conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Merz said any ceasefire must be backed by strong guarantees.

""This ceasefire must be secured by substantial legal and material security guarantees from the USA and the Europeans,"" he said.

Merz added that proposals presented by the United States in Berlin marked significant progress.

""What the USA has put on the table here in Berlin in terms of legal and material guarantees is really remarkable. That is a very important step forward, which I very much welcome,"" he said.

""Negotiators from President Trump played a key role, and I want to make this clear: without their tireless efforts and without President Trump's commitment, we would not have the positive momentum we are experiencing here at this very moment,"" Merz said.

Ukraine talks in Berlin have been really positive, with broad consensus emerging on a number of issues, a US official has told the Reuters news agency.

The official said discussions had produced agreement in several areas, while some issues had been delegated to working groups for further talks.

The official praised European participants, saying European representatives had been outstanding, and added that President Trump was pleased with the current state of negotiations.

The official said there was hope the process was on a path to peace.

Security guarantees have made significant progress, according to the official, including work on Article 5-like guarantees.

The official said these guarantees would not remain on the table indefinitely and added that Trump was focused on stopping Russian forces from moving west.

AP news agency reported, also citing the US side, that Russia indicated it is open to Ukraine joining the EU as part of a peace deal.

Ukraine's security service has carried out what it calls a unique special operation in the port of Novorossiysk, using underwater drones to strike a Russian submarine.

The SBU said in a statement on Telegram that underwater drones known as ""Sub Sea Baby"" hit a Project 636.3 submarine, known as the Varshavyanka class, or Kilo class in NATO terminology.

""For the first time in history, underwater drones 'Sub Sea Baby' blew up a Russian Project 636.3 Varshavyanka-class submarine,"" the SBU said.

""As a result of the explosion, the submarine sustained critical damage and has effectively been put out of action.""

The SBU said the submarine was carrying four Kalibr cruise missile launchers, which Russia has used to strike targets in Ukraine.

The latest round of talks between Ukrainian and US officials in Berlin has ended, Ukrainian media have reported.

The top Ukrainian negotiator with the United States has said two days of discussions in Berlin had been ""constructive and productive, with real progress achieved."" 

Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, in a post on X, also thanked US President Trump and praised the US team led by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner for "" working extremely constructively to help Ukraine find a way to a peace agreement that lasts.""

Germany will deepen its commitment to Ukraine's defense through joint ventures, market integration and possible investment guarantees under a 10-point plan unveiled on Monday during  Zelenskyy's visit to Berlin.

""A strong Ukrainian defense industry is crucial for defense against Russia's war of aggression and is an important element of security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression,"" said the document.

Both countries' defense ministries will hold regular, high-level consultations and will cooperate more closely on defense-related research, joint ventures and procurement, with Germany, Ukraine's largest supporter in Europe, looking into the use of federal investment guarantees, according to a statement.

Berlin and Kyiv would also take measures to prevent corruption, the document said, acknowledging concerns about Kyiv's biggest graft scandal of the war that prompted the resignation of two ministers and Zelenskyy's chief of staff.

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier received Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy while the Ukrainian leader is in Berlin for talks with US envoys and European leaders.

Steinmeier welcomed Zelensky at Bellevue Palace, where the two leaders embraced on the steps upon Zelensky's arrival. 

Police cordoned off the area around Bellevue Palace, the president's official residence, while snipers were positioned on the building's roof, and a helicopter circled overhead.

As the head of state, Steinmeier has mainly ceremonial duties while Chancellor Friedrich Merz is responsible for the day-to-day running of the country. Merz is scheduled to host Zelenskyy at an economic forum and talks with other European leaders later on Monday (see entry below for Zelenskyy's schedule in Berlin).

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy took part in talks with US special envoy Steve Wikoff and US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner in Berlin.  

There were no immediate public statements on the talks, which lasted roughly 90 minutes after a five-hour session on Sunday.

An official briefed on the discussions told the AFP news agency the US is continuing to push Ukraine to withdraw from the eastern Donbas region as a condition of peace talks with Russia. Zelenskyy has earlier made clear that such a step is a non-starter for Kyiv. 

""Putin wants territory,"" the official told AFP, adding that Ukraine was ""not agreeing"" to the demand.

""It's a bit striking that the Americans are taking the Russians' position on this issue,"" the official added.

The most recent uptick in international negotiations for an end to Russia's invasion of Ukraine began when Witkoff presented a plan drafted with Russian counterpart Kirill Dmitriev that was widely regarded as favorable to Russia.

That plan was later revised by Zelenskyy and European leaders and presented to the US.

Russia declared the anti-Kremlin feminist protest punk band Pussy Riot ""extremist"" — a label often used in Russia to outlaw critics of President Vladimir Putin. The label makes any interaction with the band, even posts on social media, illegal in Russia

A Moscow court upheld prosecution submissions ""to recognize the punk band Pussy Riot as an extremist organization and ban its activities on the territory of the Russian Federation.""

The ruling makes it easier for authorities to go after the band's supporters inside Russia or people who have worked with them in the past.

Pussy Riot's exiled members have repeatedly spoken out against the Russian war in Ukraine, and the band's songs and videos have been banned in Russia since 2012.

A court in September issued them jail sentences in absentia of up to 13 years after convicting them of telling lies about the Russian army. Pussy Riot gained international notoriety in 2012 after performing an anti-Putin protest in a church.

Leonid Solovyov, the band's lawyer, told the independent outlet SOTAvision that the ruling was ""another action that shuts up those who speak out of turn.""

Band members, long-time opponents of the Kremlin, were expecting the decision.

""The law is designed to erase Pussy Riot from the minds of Russian citizens"" they said on social media last week.

Founding member Nadya Tolokonnikova, who has recently been performing in the United States and whose arrest the Russian authorities are seeking even after having spent two years in jail for the church protest song, shrugged off the move to designate the group as extremist.

""Extremism is invading other countries and committing war crimes. Punks, artists, tricksters, blissful people — they are the voice of common sense in the country,"" she wrote on X late last month.

Most Ukrainians don't see the war ending soon, according to a poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. 

It also found a steep drop in trust of the United States, and that most Ukrainians were committed to endure a longer war in exchange for a better peace deal and a wide majority is against withdrawing from the Donbas region.  

72% of Ukrainians would approve a peace plan that includes freezing the situation behind the current frontline along with security guarantees for Ukraine and without officially recognizing the occupied territories as part of Russia

The results were based on telephone interviews of 547 randomly sampled Ukrainians over the age of 18 in territory controlled by the government in Kyiv.

Russian presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Putin was ""open to peace"" in Ukraine but was against a temporary ceasefire.

""[Putin] is open to peace, to serious peace, to serious decisions,"" Peskov said Monday, according to the state-owned TASS news agency. ""He is absolutely not open to aand creating artificial respites.""

Peskov added that Ukraine refraining from joining the NATO alliance was fundamental to a potential settlement of the war.

""Naturally this issue is one of the cornerstones and, of course, it is subject to special discussion,"" he said.

Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine renounce its NATO ambitions and withdraw troops from about 10% of the Donbas region that Kyiv still controls. The Russian leader has also said Ukraine must be a neutral country and that no NATO troops can be stationed in Ukraine.

Many of the peace terms Putin has sought to dictate have been rejected by Ukrainian officials and have complicated international efforts to ensure Ukraine's security following the Russian invasion.

Peskov said he expected Russia to be updated on the state of talks among Ukrainian and European leaders on Monday in Berlin by the US envoys also in the German capital.

Nearly four years into Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, fighting continued Monday. Russian forces captured the town of Pishchane in Ukraine's eastern Dnipropetrovsk region.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's energy minister said on Monday that Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have left over 430,000 people without power in the Odesa Oblast in southern Ukraine following massive weekend attacks.

Russian forces have repeatedly targeted Ukrainian electricity production with drone and missile strikes as winter temperatures leave people in the cold.

Too old for combat, some Ukrainians in their mid-60s have formed the volunteer unit ""Steppe Wolves."" Driven by personal loss and a sense of duty, the men do the tasks that regular soldiers can't close to the front line in southern Ukraine.

As Russian advances stretch Ukraine's military thin in the Zaporizhzhia region, the group helps fill critical gaps.

Low visibility from the haze disrupted air and rail travel on Monday.

Over 40 flights were reported to have been cancelled while dozen others were delayed. 

The Delhi airport had earlier issued a travel advisory, warning passengers of disruptions.

Donald Trump issued a bizarre statement in which he claimed director Rob Reiner, and his wife, succumbed to “Trump derangement syndrome” after they were found dead in their home.

Nick Rainer, 32, the couple's son, was arrested after they were reportedly found dead by their daughter with their throats slit at their LA home.

Mr Trump issued a statement in which he suggested Reiner's “obsession” with him contributed to his death.

“A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood. Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as Trump derangement syndrome,” the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform.

He continued: “He [Reiner] was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before. May Rob and Michele rest in peace!”

Nick previously struggled with drug addiction, which began in his early teens and left him living intermittently on the streets.

In 2016, he told People: “I was homeless in Maine. I was homeless in New Jersey. I was homeless in Texas. I spent nights on the street. I spent weeks on the street. It was not fun.”

His experience later became the story of a semi-autobiographical film, Being Charlie, which he co-wrote and his father directed. Nick, who admitted in interviews that he “didn't bond” with his father, said the film had brought them closer together.

The Los Angeles Fire Department said it responded to a medical aid request shortly after 3.30pm on Sunday and found a 78-year-old man and 68-year-old woman dead inside the building. Reiner turned 78 in March.

Showbusiness website TMZ reported that the Reiners had their throats slit, allegedly by a family member.

Reiner was one of the most prolific directors in Hollywood. His work included some of the most memorable films of the 1980s and 90s, including This is Spinal Tap, A Few Good Men, When Harry Met Sally and The Princess Bride. He also acted, starring in Sleepless in Seattle and The Wolf of Wall Street, among others.

Michele Reiner was ‍at one time a photographer, and took the image of Mr Trump that appears on the cover of his book Trump: The Art of the ⁠Deal.

A spokesman for the Reiner family said: “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.”

Billy Crystal, who starred in When Harry Met Sally alongside Meg Ryan, was seen at the Reiner family home looking distraught hours after the bodies were discovered. Crystal was accompanied by his wife Janice, who appeared to be wiping a tear from her eye.

The comedian and actor Larry David, who was friends with Reiner, was also seen at the home and appeared upset too, a neighbour said.

Reiner, the son of the actor and screenwriter Carl Reiner, met his wife while he was directing When Harry Met Sally. They married in 1989 and had three children together, Jake, 34, Nick, and Romy.

Reiner also adopted a daughter, Tracy Reiner, 61, with his first wife, Penny Marshall, who played Laverne in Laverne & Shirley.

Jake, a former sports reporter, was inspired by his father's love of baseball. He later moved into acting and producing.

Romy, who has a few small acting credits in American films, was often pictured on the red carpet and on holiday with her parents.

Reiner was a Democrat, backing John Kerry in 2004 and featured in advertisements ‍taking aim at the incumbent president George W Bush. He also supported the Democratic presidential hopefuls Al Gore and Hillary Clinton, and was a critic of Mr Trump.

Barack Obama, the former president, paid tribute, writing on X: “Rob's achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen.

“But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people – and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action.”

Actor Jerry O'Connell, who starred in the 1986 film Stand By Me, which Reiner directed, told CBS News that the late director earned his respect because he “did the work”.

O'Connell said: “Rob was a nepo baby. His father was a huge comedy star but Rob did the work.

“On All In The Family they did maybe close to 200 episodes... he had so much experience by the time he was directing Stand By Me.

“I was talking to (co-stars) Corey Feldman and Wil Wheaton about it last night, he would feed us new lines that weren't written, ad lib lines.

“That was just from hundreds of hours of television, thousands of hours working there. The guy did the work, he had so much experience.”

O'Connell told CBS: “I don't mean this as any offence to my parents. Rob was like a father to me. It's just surreal, it really is. Everything I have is because of Rob Reiner.”

Karen Bass, the Los Angeles mayor, called Reiner's death a devastating loss for the city.

She said in a statement: “Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice.

“An acclaimed actor, director, producer, writer, and engaged political activist, he always used his gifts in service of others.”

Eric Idle, the British actor and star of Monty Python, revealed he spoke to Reiner hours before his death. In a tribute, he wrote: “Rob Reiner was a lovely man. I spoke to him last night for over an hour. I always enjoyed his company.

“Last thing he said to me was: ‘See you next year.' Such a terrible end. Such a sweet man.”

He also said they discussed “filming at Stonehenge and his thoughts for the future”.

In a statement, actress Jamie Lee Curtis and her husband Christopher Guest said: “Christopher and I are numb and sad and shocked about the violent, tragic deaths of our dear friends Rob and Michele Singer Reiner and our only focus and care right now is for their children and immediate families and we will offer all support possible to help them.

“There will be plenty of time later to discuss the creative lives we shared and the great political and social impact they both had on the entertainment industry, early childhood development, the fight for gay marriage and their global care for a world in crisis. We have lost great friends. Please give us time to grieve.”

Donald Trump issued a sabre-rattling ultimatum to Indiana Republicans on Thursday.

“Anybody that votes against redistricting, and the SUCCESS of the Republican Party in DC, will be, I am sure, met with a MAGA primary in the spring,” the president warned.

Yet despite the president's threats, the state legislature torpedoed the proposal, designed to help flip two seats for the party in next year's midterm elections, with a remarkable 21 Republicans crossing the aisle to join all 10 Democrats in a 31-19 vote.

The startling display of defiance was the latest sign that the president's vice-like grip on his party is loosening, amid grumblings in the halls of Congress over affordability, rising healthcare costs and Venezuela boat strikes — not to mention the lingering spectre of the Epstein files.

Where absolute loyalty was once the calling card for this administration, blind obedience has evaporated in recent months. In its place, a growing number of Republicans are speaking out as the president's priorities clash with the interests of voters.

“The midterms are about fighting for your own political survival, and the fact is Trump's not running again,” said John Feehery, a Republican strategist.

Pressure on Indiana Republicans could hardly have been greater.

JD Vance, the vice-president, was twice dispatched to the state to lobby senators in person. Mike Johnson, the House Speaker, made calls to individual senators to bring them on side. Mr Trump allegedly threatened to withhold funding from the state. And a handful of state legislators were subject to bomb threats as the temperature soared.

The coordinated push for the state to redraw its maps – as Texas, Missouri and North Carolina have all offered to – was part of a bid to maintain the party's narrow 220-213 majority in the House.

Relinquishing the lower chamber could see the Democrats thwart the president's agenda and launch investigations into his administration.

Yet for local Republicans, many of whom long pre-date the Maga movement, it became a question of principle – and a golden opportunity to stick it to the White House.

“Hoosiers (people from Indiana) are very independent,” Vaneta Becker, a veteran state senator, told The Washington Post. “And they're not used to Washington trying to tell us what to do.”

In the wake of the landslide defeat, Mr Trump was cold-eyed. “He'll probably lose his next primary, whenever that is. I hope he does, because he's done a tremendous disservice,” he said of one legislator who defied him.

The local redistricting defeat comes as Mr Johnson is facing down a revolt from disgruntled House Republicans, who have criticised him for ignoring the concerns of the party rank and file to appease the administration.

“You got moderates who are trying to deliver for their constituents and avoid poking the Trump bear,” said Mr Feehery. “Others are trying to be the next big thing.”

Last week, Elise Stefanik, the New York representative, accused Mr Johnson of lying after he left out a provision she had championed in a defence bill.

Nancy Mace, the South Carolina representative, penned an op-ed for The New York Times in which she accused House leadership of marginalising female members.

Meanwhile, the president's explosive fallout with Marjorie Taylor-Greene, the former Maga firebrand who has announced she will retire in January, has driven a wedge between him and a faction of his Maga base.

Central to their fallout was Ms Taylor Greene's increasingly strident opposition to the administration's adventurist foreign policy and failure to renew the premium health insurance tax credits relied on by millions of Americans.

With healthcare premiums set to spike when subsidies expire at the end of the year, several Republicans from battleground districts have broken ranks to approve a Democratic proposal to extend them.

“We need to actually pass something that will become law that will stop that healthcare cliff,” Kevin Kiley, the California representative, said.

Amid the chaos, Ms Taylor Greene is said to be taking the signatures of members in an effort to oust Mr Johnson, according to MS Now. The Georgia representative has denied the reports but is at loggerheads with Mr Johnson, whom she claimed earlier this week does not take women seriously.

Unsettled by a spate of Democratic wins in off-year elections, Senate Republicans have been urging the president to do more to respond to voters' concerns around the cost of living.

Mr Trump took to the campaign trail for the first time in months last week for the first stop in his affordability tour. However, his insistence that financial pains are a “con job” manufactured by the Democrats did little to appease party officials.

“You can't call it a hoax and suggest that people are going to believe it,” said Lisa Murkowski, the senator for Alaska.

Critics have dismissed the president's strikes on boats off Venezuela as a “wag the dog” tactic designed to distract from his economic woes.

Yet a double-tap strike that tested the limits of international law has angered traditional conservatives and isolationists alike, sparking calls from Republican senators for footage of the attack to be released.

These come on top of the president's decision last month to sign a bill ordering the release of the Epstein files, after he was forced into a bruising U-turn following pressure from within his own party.

“Clearly there's a sense that Trump has become more of a lame duck so people are trying to figure out their own political future,” said Mr Feehery. “Trump is still the 800lb gorilla in the Republican Party so people don't necessarily want to pick a fight, but they are doing it strategically on issues that work for them.”

Talk of a lame duck presidency may be premature. But as Republicans look ahead to 2026, some are starting to test whether running against their party may provide the surest path to victory.

Zionism turned the moral of the Hanukkah story on its head to praise militarism. In truth, it is a holiday of peace.

Zionism turned the moral of the Hanukkah story on its head to praise militarism. In truth, it is a holiday of peace.

As we produce journalism that combats authoritarianism, censorship, injustice, and misinformation, your support is urgently needed. Please make a year-end gift to Truthout today.

When I was 19 years old, I traveled to Israel to find long-lost relatives who had survived the Holocaust. While I was there, I was “picked up” on the street by an ultra-orthodox woman who offered me free lodging in a hostel exclusively for Jewish travelers in the Old City of Jerusalem. I was a broke teenager at the time, so I said yes. It was Hanukkah, and all across the Jewish Quarter, picturesque oil menorahs twinkled in the windows and doorways of ancient-looking buildings built from a pearly-pink marble called “Jerusalem stone.” 

I didn't grow up celebrating Hanukkah, so my hosts explained to me that in 167 BCE, the ancient Jewish Temple, which once stood just around the corner from where I was staying, had been occupied by the mighty Hellenistic Seleucid Empire. Luckily, a small group of rebels known as the Maccabees fought back and recaptured the Temple. Since then, they said, Jews have kindled Hanukkah candles every year in honor of this marvelous battle, and dreamed of a return to reoccupy these very homes, in this exact neighborhood. The fact that we were finally there, they said, was the Hanukkah miracle come true.

I was captivated. It was an inspiring story, perfectly matched by the stirring ancient setting. Unfortunately, almost none of it was true. 

The pearlescent stone buildings that looked age-old to my teenage eyes had actually mostly been constructed in the last few decades, on top of Palestinian homes that were bulldozed after Jerusalem was seized by the Israeli military in 1967. John Tleel, a Palestinian whose family lived in the Old City for 400 years, describes how the residents of the neighborhood where I was staying were given only 12 hours to evacuate. New homes and plazas were hastily built over what is now known as the Jewish Quarter, and constructed to look as if they'd always been there.

Likewise, Hanukkah, as a tale of a glorious battle, is a thin Zionist facade, pasted onto an old story that conveyed the opposite meaning for thousands of years. Traditionally, Hanukkah was a quiet, pacifist festival that taught an age-old lesson about the dangers of zealotry and the wisdom of gentleness in the face of force. 

It is true that in 167 BCE, there was a Jewish uprising against the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire, led by a group of rebels known as the Maccabees, which means “the hammers.” However, the Maccabees were not just fighting against the Hellenists. They were also fighting with many other Jewish groups who they saw as weak collaborationists because they wanted to negotiate with, instead of fight, the Seleucid Empire. In the end, the Maccabees' military tactics led to a lot of bloodshed and a short-lived victory. The Temple was soon destroyed. For the next two thousand years, Jews lived all over the world, ate different foods, and spoke different languages. It was not retaking the land or rebuilding an army that led to our cultural survival, but telling shared stories that fostered a sense of belonging across generations and around the world. 

Hanukkah was a quiet, pacifist festival that taught an age-old lesson about the dangers of zealotry and the wisdom of gentleness in the face of force. 

For centuries, the Maccabees didn't make it into these Jewish sacred stories. The Book of Maccabees, which records their battle, is a holy text in Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christianity, but it's not included in Jewish holy books. In the Talmud, the ancient texts that lie at the center of all Jewish laws and practices, the rabbis ask: “What is Hanukkah about, anyway?” They knew the history of the Maccabees, but their question implies that they didn't see this event as worthy of celebration. Instead, they offer a very different tale to explain the season: “For when the Hellenists entered the Temple, they defiled all the oils in it, and when the Hasmonean dynasty prevailed over them and defeated them, they searched and found only one bottle of oil sealed by the High Priest. It contained only enough for one day's lighting. Yet a miracle was brought about with it, and they lit with that oil for eight days.” (Shabbat 21b)

Early Zionists took the Maccabees from obscurity and claimed them as heroes precisely because traditional Judaism had dismissed them as unpleasant zealots.

This story is a consciously gentle miracle. Instead of celebrating the Maccabees' military might, it lifts up spiritual values of faith, trust, and patience in a little bit going a long way. The choice to remember the perseverance of small flickering lights, and not a battle, is a decision to not canonize bloodshed even when “our” side is the winner. This message is explicit in the prophetic biblical passage from the Book of Zechariah read on the shabbat of Hanukkah in synagogue: “Not by might, nor by power, but by My spirit.” 

Zionism arose in the late 19th century as a secular European colonial movement, and many of its early tropes were explicitly a rebuke of religious Judaism. Early Zionists took the Maccabees from obscurity and claimed them as heroes precisely because traditional Judaism had dismissed them as unpleasant zealots. Early Zionists named sports clubs and athletics contests after the Maccabees, and argued that they were models for a new “muscular Jewry.” Israeli pop songs scoffed at the miracle of oil, and instead reframed the Hanukkah miracle to glorify the newly established gangs of Zionist militias that were chasing Palestinians off their lands. 

This was a completely new and intentionally irreligious version of Hanukkah. And yet historical memory can be very short. Today, many people, including leftists, have forgotten that there is another, more ancient version of Hanukkah underneath the modern, Zionist facade. In this time of ongoing genocide in Palestine and cascading worldwide catastrophes, remembering the original meaning of Hanukkah, and its refusal to celebrate violence, is particularly important. 

The word Hanukkah means rededication, because the Temple was defiled by the Hellenist Empire, and the menorah needed to be kindled to rededicate it. Since October 7, 2023, ancient Jewish symbols like the Star of David have been burned into Palestinian farmlands and branded onto the cheeks of Palestinians as signs of domination. Today, we again need to rededicate what has been defiled by this monstrous disregard of life. 

As authoritarianism rises worldwide and many of our systems of care fragment, we need to save our age-old stories like seeds in a seed bank, as they contain vital spiritual nourishment. Within the story of Hanukkah's oil, there are timeless, universal truths that we will need in order to survive this era: tales last longer than Temples, and faith can be more powerful than force. The night is often long, with only a little bit of fuel to warm and light it, but when we work together in solidarity, there is enough for everyone.

 Why the Lessons of Ukraine Don't Apply to a Conflict With China

 Justin Bronk

After nearly four years of fighting, few aspects of Russia's war in Ukraine have gained as much attention among Western militaries as the rapid expansion of drone warfare. Since 2023, both sides have deployed millions of cheap quadcopter-type drones across the battlefield. In some parts of the front, these small drones now account for up to 70 percent of battlefield casualties. Meanwhile, Russia is using thousands of Geran-2 and Geran-3 propeller-powered one-way attack drones in almost nightly long-range strikes on Ukrainian cities, and Ukraine has been using a wide array of its own one-way attack drones for regular strikes on Russian bases, factories, and energy infrastructure.

Watching these developments, many Western defense strategists have made urgent calls to shift military priorities. In June, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to accelerate drone production. Since then, the U.S. Department of Defense has made several policy changes to facilitate the rapid integration of low-cost drones into the U.S. arsenal, and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has called for the United States to establish “drone dominance.” In the private sector, meanwhile, software and AI companies that have bet heavily on developing uncrewed military technologies, such as Anduril, Palantir, and Shield AI, are racing to win lucrative new defense contracts. It is certainly the case that small uncrewed aircraft systems have fundamentally changed the way that infantry combat is fought, and that the U.S. Army and other parts of the force are behind on these capabilities—and, more concerning, on counter-UAS technologies—compared to Russian or Chinese forces.

But the assumption that large-scale acquisition of AI-enabled drones will strengthen U.S. defenses against China is misguided. For one thing, lessons from the war in Ukraine—an attritional, inconclusive struggle between two fundamentally land-centric armed forces—often do not apply directly to other kinds of conflicts. The realities of Beijing's military arsenal and the likely nature of any potential confrontation in the Indo-Pacific mean that such a conflict would be decided by very different factors. Despite having the largest and most advanced drone industry in the world, China has actually been prioritizing crewed military hardware. Each year, the People's Liberation Army receives eye-watering numbers of modern and highly capable combat aircraft, large warships, and cutting-edge ground-based, maritime, and air-launched missile systems. If the United States focuses too heavily on drone development and acquisition, it risks losing its slim remaining edge over the PLA in the high-end air force and navy capabilities that would dominate any Indo-Pacific conflict.

Over the past few years, military analysts and defense industry executives alike have focused on the lessons that Western militaries should supposedly take from Ukraine's remarkable defense against Russia. One result of this interest has been an oversaturation of new defense products and technologies that are being marketed to Western militaries as “transformational,” based on vaguely described combat use in Ukraine. In fact, many such systems, especially Western-made drones from tech startup firms, have proved ineffective or even failed outright on the battlefield in the face of omnipresent Russian (and Ukrainian) electronic warfare and hard environmental conditions.

A larger problem, however, is that the war in Ukraine features many characteristics that would not apply to U.S. and Chinese forces in an Indo-Pacific context. Russia's ongoing ground invasion of Ukraine has resulted in sparsely manned frontlines stretching more than 600 miles from Kharkiv Oblast in the north to Kherson in the south. Neither side has achieved air superiority, making airpower far less significant than in other modern conflicts. Since both Russian and Ukrainian armored formations and other elite units suffered catastrophic losses in the early phases of the war, neither side has been able to conduct large-scale combined-arms maneuver warfare since mid-2023. As a result, both armies have had to rely heavily on small infantry units with attached tank, artillery, and drone support to make probing attacks through minefields against fixed defensive lines. Progress is grindingly slow and costly in both directions.

Under these conditions, short-range, lightweight, cheap, and mass-produced quadcopter-type drones have proved highly effective. Especially as conventional artillery and long-range rocket artillery ammunition and launchers have become increasingly scarce, both sides have used cheap drones to inflict attrition and suppress the enemy's resupply and tactical movements within six to 12 miles of the frontlines. By 2024, frontline combat had indeed come to be dominated by ever greater numbers of drones and the constant development of new technologies such as fiber-optic drones and AI-assisted terminal imaging guidance. Counterdrone defenses such as netting, electronic jamming, and specialized shotgun and cannon ammunition types have likewise become critical and continue to evolve rapidly. However, many active counterdrone defense systems are overstretched in Ukraine due to the widely dispersed nature of forces on the frontlines and constant attrition.

Even so, the expansion of drone warfare is arguably not what has prevented Ukrainian forces from holding key positions against Russian forces in 2024 and 2025. Instead, it is the hundreds of heavy glide bombs that Russia is delivering by Su-34 fighter-bombers against the frontlines each week. These 500kg–3000kg glide bombs can demolish even deep, hardened fighting positions and kill dug-in troops far more effectively than small drones, and Ukraine still lacks an effective way to intercept the launch aircraft that release the bombs from more than 40 miles behind the frontlines. Drones inflict the majority of day-to-day attrition against infantry and vehicles on the move in and around the frontlines, but concentrated glide bomb attacks pose a much greater threat to dug-in troops. Relentless Russian glide bomb strikes on key positions have been particularly difficult for Ukrainian troops fighting to hold heavily fortified strategic locations, such as the hilltop city of Chasiv Yar in Donetsk Oblast.

In sharp contrast to the operational conditions in Ukraine, any likely conflict between U.S. forces and China's People's Liberation Army would unfold predominantly in the air and at sea, with combat between land forces likely limited to key islands such as Taiwan or the Senkakus (known in China as the Diaoyus). In this context, success for the United States would depend on the ability to rapidly and repeatedly bring decisive airborne and maritime firepower to bear at those key points at critical moments. This would mean projecting power across thousands of miles of ocean against numerous highly advanced Chinese missile, air, and maritime threats. Such operations would require highly trained personnel manning advanced fighter aircraft, bombers, and warships conducting mutually supporting actions in carefully synchronized joint operations. In other words, the conflict would involve very different kinds of forces and equipment from what either Ukraine or Russia is using in the current war.

In an Indo-Pacific conflict, drones would likely still play a significant role in land and amphibious operations. Taiwan, for example, could greatly benefit from being able to deploy hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of small drones to repel a PLA landing force on its beaches. It would also be essential for Taiwanese forces to have counterdrone capabilities that could sustainably intercept and jam PLA one-way attack drones and surveillance drones flying from the mainland or from ships off the beaches. Yet such uncrewed systems would be useless to the U.S. Air Force and Navy in their efforts to assist with air cover and, ultimately, maritime support, which would require projecting power from Guam or other distant U.S. bases.

Distances are punishing in the Indo-Pacific. The greatest shortcoming of the current generation of “exquisite” American fighter aircraft—the F-22, F-35, and F/A-18E/F—against growing Chinese threats is not that they are expensive and comparatively few. It is their comparatively limited range. With combat radii of between 350 and 600 miles, they require aerial refueling tankers to reach contested areas from viable bases, which in conflict would have to fly dangerously close to Chinese missile and fighter aircraft threats. Small drones cannot solve this problem. Even the longest-range fiber-optic-cable-equipped first-person view drones in common use in Ukraine are limited to around 15 miles, and most small FPVs have significantly shorter ranges than that. In other words, the one weapons system that has made combat in Ukraine significantly different from that of previous state-on-state wars would be largely irrelevant in the critical early phases of a conflict between Chinese and American forces.



Even if small drones could be delivered rapidly across the required ranges, none of the varieties currently in use in Ukraine by either side could effectively defend U.S. forces against Chinese attacks. Beijing already operates thousands of high-end ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles that would be used to strike U.S. forward bases, aircraft carriers, tanker aircraft, and other key large assets. To counter such threats, the U.S. military would unavoidably have to rely on multimillion-dollar missile defense systems such as the Patriot PAC-3 MSE, THAAD, SM-6, and SM-3. Intercepting hundreds of increasingly capable Chinese combat aircraft will, likewise, require large quantities of advanced air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-260 JATM and the AIM-174B, as well as the AIM-120D AMRAAM. These will be needed in large quantities regardless of whether they are launched by crewed fighters or, potentially, in the future by AI-enabled uncrewed systems. Small drones simply cannot intercept combat aircraft operating at high altitudes and speeds.

Moreover, the many types of uncrewed systems that would potentially be far more useful in the Indo-Pacific will entail large costs of their own. For example, stealthy Collaborative Combat Aircraft—automated or AI-enabled uncrewed combat aircraft intended to accompany and support traditional fighters—are expected to cost as much as $20 million to $30 million apiece. The less ambitious designs that are intended to be little more than forward sensors and weapon-launching “trucks” will still cost many millions of dollars. There may well be significant benefits to their development and adoption, but they cannot be “swarmed” or expended en masse on a regular basis given their cost.

Operating these systems will also require large numbers of human maintainers, armorers, logisticians, force protection personnel, and other specialists to prepare them for flight, recover them after use, maintain them, and move them to launch locations in theater—personnel who will have to be reassigned from other activities. CCAs also will not fundamentally change the U.S. military's position relative to the PLA, since China is developing similar systems.

Simpler, one-way attack, decoy, or stand-in jamming-type drones can be somewhat cheaper to produce and could still perform vital roles within a complex joint strike package. But even these drones will likely cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to be able to have the required range and performance. AI-enabled swarming behavio­rs in flight may increase the effectiveness of such drones or missiles in various tactical situations, but the data links and processing power required will further increase unit cost, and thus quantities will remain limited. Weapons that serve much the same purposes—smart stand-off attack, decoys, and stand-in jammers—have already existed for decades in the form of cruise missiles and decoys such as the ADM-160 MALD-X. The issue is not that these existing tools are unable to perform the required roles; it is that the United States does not have enough of them.

For the United States, it is unavoidably clear that a significant peer conflict will require very different resourcing than the overseas interventions and counterinsurgency operations that it has conducted in recent decades. In any confrontation with China, the U.S. military would need vast stockpiles of ammunition, spare parts, medical supplies, and other logistical necessities. Washington currently has significant shortfalls of key long-range strike, antiship, and interceptor missiles, and most of its allies lack them to a greater degree still. The United States also has a shrinking and increasingly aging conventional force structure thanks to more than a decade of deferred air force and navy modernization during the global war on terrorism. The sheer cost of bringing back “combat mass” with conventional high-end military systems has driven an almost frantic search by many defense analysts and policymakers for a way to get AI-enabled technology, including drones, to deliver “cheap mass.”

The PLA, by contrast, increasingly has both mass and quality. Strikingly, despite having by far the world's largest and most advanced drone-manufacturing industrial base, China's major military focus is on acquiring more crewed combat aircraft, large warships, and advanced missile systems. The People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) is on course to have a fleet of around 1,000 J-20s—China's primary fifth-generation stealth fighter—by 2030. China is also building many hundreds of advanced antiship and long-range surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles, and tens of advanced destroyers and cruisers per year. Especially in the air-to-air and surface-to-air missile domain, many of these Chinese systems are starting to exceed the performance of their U.S. equivalents in some key areas. Almost all of this production is going to the PLA rather than to export customers like Pakistan, and much of it would likely be brought to bear in any Chinese attempt to capture Taiwan, as well as any other conflict involving Beijing in the East China or South China Seas.

By comparison, while Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighters are being built at a slightly higher rate than China's J-20A and J-20S, only some of that production is being purchased by the U.S. military. The U.S. Air Force purchased just 48 F-35As in 2025 and plans to purchase fewer than that in each of the remaining years of the current decade. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps are acquiring other variants of the fighter, but most of the balance of Lockheed Martin's current output is destined for U.S. allies in Europe and Asia. The next generation F-47 fighter, which is expected to cost more than $300 million apiece, is not scheduled to enter U.S. Air Force service until the early 2030s as a production standard combat asset. An equivalent next-generation program for the U.S. Navy, called F/A-XX, will come even later still, assuming the program goes ahead. By that point, however, the next-generation Chinese J-36, J-XDS, and J-50 equivalents, all of which are already in flight testing, will likely also be in service. They may be marginally less capable than the F-47 on a per-aircraft basis but they will likely be produced faster and in greater numbers.



Another area in which China's high-end capabilities are already outstripping those of the United States is in airborne long-range early warning and command system (AWACS) aircraft. These aircraft are huge force multipliers because they provide air forces and joint forces with long-range, wide-area radar coverage for early warning, battlespace management, and targeting. The PLA already has roughly 60 modern AWACS, all equipped with the latest active electronically scanned array-type radars and advanced data link and satellite communications capabilities to act as network nodes. More are being produced each year.

By contrast, the U.S. Air Force has only 16 serviceable AWACS, and these are the nearly obsolete and badly worn-out E-3G Sentry. The plan to acquire the Boeing E-7A Wedgetail to replace this rapidly shrinking fleet was canceled by Hegseth in June 2025, citing concerns over cost overruns, delays, and operational vulnerability. Congress included $400 million to continue the program in the bipartisan bill to end the U.S. government shutdown in November, but even if the program does survive, it may be downsized and still faces significant delays. That means that the United States will face an airborne sensor and airborne networking and battle management node gap with China for at least a decade. Both nations are pursuing advanced space-based sensor and networking capabilities, but these are not yet ready to replace AWACS coverage.

The uncomfortable fact is that there are no easy answers to the challenge posed by China's growing air, maritime, and missile capabilities in the Indo-Pacific. To an overwhelming degree, the U.S. military relies on its air force and navy to credibly deter Chinese military aggression against Taiwan or elsewhere. There is no way to change the entire joint force to a fundamentally different structure in time to face the threat in the coming years. Trying to replicate Ukraine's emphasis on drones at a vast scale will not solve the problem. American military and political decision-makers should focus instead on fixing the increasingly large gaps in existing conventional air and maritime forces. To do this, Washington has few alternatives to urgent, heavy investment in far greater production capacity and rapid procurement of existing long-range air-to-air, surface-to-air, and air-to-surface missiles, as well as F-35, F-47, and B-21 combat aircraft and nuclear attack submarines.

Dealing with these critical shortfalls will require either major budget increases—unlikely in the current environment—or major cuts elsewhere in the joint force structure. But unless the United States can maintain air and maritime superiority over key contested areas, it will find that the rest of its military force structure will struggle to produce relevant combat power against China in any Indo-Pacific clash. Millions of battlefield quadcopters and tens of thousands of one-way attack drones have not enabled Russia to defeat Ukraine, or vice versa. Even if the Pentagon acquires similar capabilities, they will not change its rapidly degrading balance of power with China in the Indo-Pacific, no matter how good swarms of AI-enabled drones might look on PowerPoint slides.

 Despite the Bombastic Rhetoric, America Isn't Retreating

 Rebeccah Heinrichs

The Trump administration's 2025 National Security Strategy is, in many ways, unlike any in U.S. history. Most strategy documents of this kind articulate the threats that the United States' adversaries pose to Washington and its allies, and they explain how officials can respond to these challenges. But this one seems kinder to the United States' foes than to its friends. It rebukes Europe in an astonishingly blunt fashion, arguing that some of the continent's domestic policies are damaging democracy and risking “civilizational erasure.” It says remarkably little, by contrast, about the threats posed by China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea. As a result, the response to the NSS among Washington's traditional foreign policy elite has been overwhelmingly angry—and panicked.

But anxious analysts should take a breath. Dig a little deeper, and the new document, almost certainly written by many hands, is more complex than it appears at first glance. In fact, it reflects more continuity with the last several strategies than its most attention-grabbing passages suggest. The strategy does not call for the United States to abandon Europe or its other traditional allies. It does not open the door to Chinese expansionism. And it does not indicate that Washington is preparing to withdraw from much of the world. Quite the contrary: it suggests that the United States still has globe-spanning shared interests with its historical allies, and that the country is planning to expand its geographical interests.

U.S. allies, in particular, should focus on the dimensions of the strategy that pertain to vital American interests. The document, for example, makes clear that Washington can and should increase military collaboration with its partners. The strategy also suggests that officials can boost and adapt Washington's extended nuclear deterrent. And it provides reasons for strengthening allied conventional defenses and maintaining the United States' forward military deployments. Washington's friends and partners should use the new strategy as a reason to keep doing much of what they already are doing or plan to do—but with a renewed sense of urgency.

The new strategy may not be the catastrophe that its critics suggest. But there's no whitewashing its flaws. For starters, it pointedly neglects to name and describe the primary threat that the United States and its allies face: the authoritarian bloc of China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Trump's 2017 national security strategy made it clear that “China and Russia challenge American power, influence, and interests” and described “the dictatorships of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Islamic Republic of Iran” as “determined to destabilize regions, threaten Americans and our allies, and brutalize their own people.” But even though this bloc of states has expanded its military capabilities and heightened its collaboration in the intervening years, the 2025 strategy does not describe them or the risk that they pose to American security. One of the countries, North Korea, isn't even mentioned.

Instead, the document trains most of its ire on Europe. The continent's governments, it declares, are eroding free speech, strangling economic growth, and letting in unvetted foreigners who do not assimilate. These claims are largely accurate, but putting them in the report only offers ammunition to Washington and Europe's common adversaries—and makes it harder for Europe to address the problems. Many politicians in Europe strongly agree with Trump's criticisms and have been fighting hard to get their countries to change course. But as one European diplomat told me, the strategy's harsh condemnations could harm such politicians' electoral fortunes. Instead of publicly rebuking Europe, the Trump administration would have been better off raising these concerns in private, as one does when dealing with struggling friends.

The strategy is also incoherent when it discusses Trump's preferred political movements inside Europe. It seems set on bolstering what the document calls “those European forces that openly embrace their national character and history”—a not-so-veiled reference to far-right parties such as the Netherlands' Party for Freedom, Reform UK, and the Alternative for Germany (AfD). But these parties advocate for polices at odds with other Trump goals, such as European rearmament, even if they agree with some Republicans on cultural matters. If the AfD had its way, Germany would close its borders to migrants, but it would remain defenseless against rising revanchist powers. Worst of all, the AfD supports the appeasement of Russia. Many members of the AfD even align with Russia, advocating for resumption of trade, opposing efforts to end Germany's dependence on Russian oil, and are hostile to NATO.

Unfortunately, Trump seeks a “reset” with Russia that echoes the failed one attempted by the progressive President Barack Obama in 2009. He has focused on creating incentives for Russia to end its war against Ukraine rather than on increasing pressure and bolstering deterrence. The document calls for stabilizing ties with Russia and declares that Washington “finds itself at odds with European officials who hold unrealistic expectations for the war” in Ukraine. It then says that “a large European majority wants peace, yet that desire is not translated into policy, in large measure because of those governments' subversion of democratic processes.” But this argument is incorrect. When Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel and were in office, Europe was far more divided on how to treat Moscow than it is now, and it was far less supportive of investing in hard power to deter Russian aggression. Today, Europeans are broadly supportive of rearming and taking on a bigger share of NATO's defense. They view Russia as a clear and acute threat and agree that they must stop Russian aggression through military strength and by ending their dependence on Russian energy.

If U.S. officials are really interested in the views of unrepresented citizens, they should instead look at their own. According to the December 2025 Reagan National Defense Survey, a majority of Americans from both political parties support Ukraine over Russia. The number who support sending U.S. weapons to Ukraine has climbed from 55 percent to 64 percent since last year. Support for NATO has also surged to 68 percent from 62 percent.

But criticism of Europe and skepticism toward Ukraine are only two parts of the new strategy. Elsewhere, the document is much more in keeping with earlier articulations of American foreign policy. Despite loud calls from the American far right to abandon commitments abroad, for example, the new document rightly asserts that U.S. interests span the planet. According to the document, Washington's “core” interests are in the Western Hemisphere, the Indo-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and “all crucial sea lanes.” The so-called pivot to Asia pushed by Obama and the current Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby remains elusive. In fact, the United States is not only maintaining Asia, Europe, and the Middle East as regions of core interest but also adding the Americas, which U.S. officials spent decades neglecting. This is not the strategy of a retrenching United States.

The strategy makes it especially clear that the United States won't cede ground to China—a fact that should come as a relief to many observers. In the run-up to the document's publication, NBC News reported that White House aides were worried that Chinese leader Xi Jinping might persuade Trump to formally declare that Washington “opposes” Taiwanese independence. But the document maintains Washington's long-standing policy of keeping its commitment to the island ambiguous, stating that the United States “does not support unilateral change to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.” Before the document came out, analysts also worried that Washington would pull back from the Quad, the U.S. led-security framework featuring Australia, India, and Japan. Yet the new strategy reaffirms Washington's commitment to the group and to a free and open Indo-Pacific in general. Meanwhile, just days after the document was released, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth met with security officials in Australia and the United Kingdom to bolster the three countries' commitment to their AUKUS pact. In doing so, he dealt a setback to so-called restrainers in the United States who want to abandon AUKUS, through which Washington plans to supply nuclear submarines to Australia.

And despite the critiques of some current European governments, the new strategy makes it emphatically clear that the United States wants Europe to be strong. The document lauds the commitments from NATO allies to boost defense spending, and it declares that “Europe remains strategically and culturally vital to the United States.” It says that “transatlantic trade remains one of the pillars of the global economy and of American prosperity” and that “European sectors from manufacturing to technology to energy remain among the world's most robust.” It notes that Europe “is home to cutting-edge scientific research and world-leading cultural institutions.” And it says that Washington cannot “afford to write Europe off,” because doing so “would be self-defeating for what this strategy aims to achieve.”



For all its flaws, then, the new strategy does not set back U.S. efforts to deter authoritarian powers. It suggests that policymakers in the United States and allied countries should keep advancing their partnerships. They can seize on the strategy's declarations, for instance, to promote traditional rearmament, pointing to the document's praise for European defense commitments and its promise that the United States “stands ready” to convene and support those efforts.

The strategy also provides space for nuclear rearmament by calling for Washington to restore strategic nuclear stability with Moscow. American officials appear to be doing just that. Shortly after the release of the strategy, Hegseth said in a speech at the Ronald Reagan Defense Forum that nuclear deterrence is the “foundation of our national defense” and reiterated the department's commitment to modernizing its nuclear arsenal. Hegseth also acknowledged that the United States faces “two other major nuclear armed powers.” This statement is important and necessary because it demonstrates that Washington will continue its role in maintaining the global nuclear peace even as Beijing and Moscow invest heavily in nuclear weapons to undergird their imperialistic aims.

Congress, meanwhile, is pushing to maintain Washington's forward troop deployments. Its just-released National Defense Authorization Act features provisions limiting troop reductions in Europe and South Korea. (The inclusion of the latter country is important and helps make up for the fact that North Korea receives no mention in the strategy document.) The House and Senate leadership understand how foolish it would be to withdraw American forces from allied countries while Russia refuses to agree to a cease-fire with Ukraine and is conducting hybrid operations in Europe, and as other authoritarian states meddle in their U.S.-aligned neighbors. Congress should ensure that Americans understand the nature and the scope of this authoritarian menace, too. Representatives should, for instance, explain to their constituents that China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are a bloc, and that this bloc is confrontational and capable of inflicting substantial damage on the United States, American interests, and Washington's partners.

Allies should not simply hope for a more conciliatory American president and hold off on making difficult but overdue decisions. They should get busy making themselves stronger—and therefore more valuable to the United States in the fight to stave off authoritarianism. As Trump's new strategy makes clear, the U.S. government expects its allies to take on more of the military burden in defense of our shared interests. But despite its blunt criticisms of American partners, the new strategy does not write them off. And, ultimately, it reaffirms Washington's many global commitments and the need for the United States to play a leading role in the world.

 How to Rescue Washington's Most Important Partnership in Latin America 

 Kevin Whitaker

On January 26, days after U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated for the second time, Colombian President Gustavo Petro provoked his country's most significant bilateral crisis with Washington in over 30 years by refusing to accept Colombian deportees from the United States. The Trump administration immediately retaliated with 25 percent tariffs on imports from Colombia, a ban on Colombian government officials' entering the United States, and a slowdown in inspections of incoming Colombian cargo and visitors. Colombia capitulated within hours, and the crisis was resolved. But the confrontation set the tone for relations going forward.

In the months since, the two countries have careened from crisis to crisis. Petro's outspoken condemnation of U.S. policies irritated Washington, as did his failure to distance himself from China and Venezuela, two U.S. adversaries. Petro repeatedly denounced U.S. military strikes on alleged drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, going so far as to call Trump a war criminal and urging American troops to disobey his orders. In response, the U.S. State Department revoked the American visas of Petro and members of his inner circle and applied sanctions against other Colombian officials, freezing their assets in the United States and denying them access to the U.S. banking system.

Separately, Petro's failure to control crime and narcotics production within Colombia, an enforcement effort that had been at the heart of the traditional bilateral relationship, merited and received a sharp response from Washington. In September, the United States “decertified” Colombia—that is, found that it had not met its international counternarcotic obligations—for the first time in nearly 30 years. The following month, Trump called Petro an “illegal drug dealer” and announced an end to all U.S. aid to Colombia. Secretary of State Marco Rubio later hedged, suggesting that U.S. support for some security activities might continue. (In 2024, the United States provided Colombia with nearly $590 million, according to the U.S. State Department.)

After decades of successful cooperation on fighting drug trafficking and transnational crime, relations between Colombia and the United States are at a historic nadir and precipitously getting worse. “I hear Colombia, the country of Colombia, is making cocaine,” Trump told reporters earlier this month. “They have cocaine manufacturing plants, OK, and then they sell us their cocaine. . . . Anybody that's doing that and selling it into our country is subject to attack.” Responding on social media, Petro invited Trump to come to Colombia to observe the destruction of cocaine laboratories, which he said happens at a rate of one every 40 minutes. He added, “Do not threaten our sovereignty, because you will awaken the jaguar.” Petro has also warned against U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, calling any such operation an “aggression against Latin America.” Speaking to reporters a week later, Trump doubled down on his threat to move on Colombia, singling out Petro: “He better wise up—or he'll be next.”

It is now possible that the U.S.-Colombian relationship could collapse entirely, bringing an end to the array of political, diplomatic, law enforcement, military, and judicial cooperation developed over the last four decades. For Colombia, a definitive break would dramatically worsen security, especially in rural areas, and enable armed groups to extend their reach in neighboring countries and potentially foment instability on Colombia's borders. The United States, having lost a key partner in the region, would see its ability to confront transnational crime curtailed. A rupture is an outcome neither side should want—but under the current administrations in Bogotá and Washington, it may be difficult to avoid.

Cooperation on security and law enforcement between the United States and Colombia began in the 1980s at the height of what came to be known as the Escobar era, a time when the infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar and his Medellín cartel were smuggling more than 80 tons of cocaine into the United States each month while terrorizing the Colombian people. By the late 1990s, a Marxist insurgency, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (known by its Spanish acronym, FARC), used profits from the cocaine trade to create a 14,000-member army that represented an existential threat to the Colombian state. In response, the Clinton administration established Plan Colombia, a multifaceted assistance program to confront drug trafficking, defeat the insurgency, and restore the effectiveness of the government.

For the next decade and a half, the United States invested substantial resources to keep Colombia, a liberal democracy, from becoming a failed state. At first, most of the support went to the security forces. The United States trained Colombian troops and has supplied nearly $6 billion in military and police support since 2000, including training and modern helicopters and other equipment. This assistance gave Colombian security forces the strength and mobility required to take on the armed rebels. Over time, this military pressure forced the FARC to relocate to ever more remote areas.

Law enforcement cooperation was another pillar of Plan Colombia. Colombian and U.S. investigators worked jointly, developing confidential sources and using legal wiretaps and other tools to bring the leaders of drug trafficking organizations to justice. The judicial efforts yielded impressive results: since 2002, more than 2,000 Colombian nationals have been extradited to the United States for prosecution, yielding a conviction rate of over 95 percent.

All told, U.S. assistance to Colombia under Plan Colombia amounted to around $14 billion, which included humanitarian and development assistance. Deploying resources that were orders of magnitude smaller than U.S. investments in Afghanistan and Iraq, the United States appeared to have achieved durable, positive results. In 2012, Colombia's security and legal entities were so respected and effective that the United States created and funded a multiyear effort, the U.S.-Colombia Action Plan on Regional Security Cooperation, through which Colombian police officers and prosecutors trained Central American counterparts.

By the end of 2015, the year Plan Colombia officially expired, every security indicator had moved in the right direction. Murders, kidnappings, and extortion were down. Coca acreage, which reached a low in 2009, was on the rise but under control. The following year, the Colombian government negotiated and signed a peace accord with the FARC, ending what was then one of the world's longest insurgencies, and the Obama administration launched Peace Colombia, a new aid program focused on helping Colombia consolidate its hard-won gains in security. In 2022, the Biden administration even designated Colombia a “major non-NATO ally,” a clear signal of the excellence of the Colombian security establishment.

Over the last three years, however, Colombia's security forces have become significantly less effective than at any time since the beginning of Plan Colombia, as 40 percent of army generals and over half of police generals have been forced to retire or were simply fired by the Petro administration. Petro seemed to be seeking to put his stamp on the security forces, ensuring that senior leaders were on board with his new approach on security. The size of the exodus of top officers meant that some of those who replaced the generals lacked the background and contacts to plan, coordinate, and execute effective counterdrug and counterterrorism operations as successfully as previous military leadership. The national Police Intelligence Directorate has been particularly affected; DIPOL was among the most capable partners in the United States' efforts against criminal groups in the region. Many of the directorate's former senior officers had extensive experience working with U.S. counterparts, so their departure leaves a gap in the bilateral relationship and marks a significant loss of institutional knowledge in combating crime and narcotics trafficking.

To make matters worse, on Petro's instruction, the Colombian military has largely discontinued operations in the most conflict-ridden areas. Since taking office in 2022 to fulfill a four-year term, Petro has implemented his so-called Paz Total (Total Peace) effort, designed to reach political accords with every criminal group in the country. Rather than continue aggressive anticrime efforts while negotiating, Petro halted most military actions against criminal groups and ceased the eradication of coca crops. According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, these policies drove up coca cultivation to 625,000 acres as of 2023, a record high at the time. Meanwhile, armed groups have greatly expanded their reach, and some have pulled back from negotiations with the government.

The end of U.S. assistance would worsen an already deteriorated security situation. U.S. intelligence support has long underpinned critical Colombian military operations. In 2024, the U.S. embassy provided over $60 million to the army and police to support the helicopter operations that enable Bogotá to move these forces around the country; it also sent five additional helicopters to the Colombian police. Without U.S. intelligence and U.S. funding, Colombia's army and police will lose much of their agility and their capacity to find and confront illegal armed groups, including the National Liberation Army (ELN), the Gaitanista Self-Defense Force of Colombia (also known as the Clan del Golfo), and several factions of FARC dissidents.

In response, these groups will seek to expand into new territory in pursuit of greater profits from drug production and trafficking, illegal mining, migrant smuggling, extortion, and other crime. At the height of Plan Colombia, in the early 2010s, armed groups had been confined to less than 20 percent of Colombian municipalities; according to the independent state Ombudsman's Office, illegal armed groups now operate in three of every four Colombian municipalities and have de facto control of a third of all municipalities. Those numbers are likely to rise as criminal enterprises grow more ambitious. And wherever they are present, particularly in rural areas, legal enterprises in Colombia's palm, rice, banana, cut-flower, and coffee industries are susceptible to extortion.

Another likely consequence is increased competition among criminal groups for territory. The productive areas and transport routes controlled by one group will always be attractive to others. Such disputes are invariably settled with violence, often resulting in significant dislocation of civilian populations. In the past, an effective government security presence could deter such violence, but Colombian forces are increasingly less able to execute this basic function. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, more than seven million Colombians are internally displaced because of previous waves of violence. That figure could soon grow.



Another predictable outcome is a resurgence of paramilitarism. In the 1980s and 1990s, so-called self-defense groups were organized by local populations and wealthy landowners to protect life and property from illegal armed groups when the government could not. The most prominent such group, the far-right United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), claimed to have been established to defend the public. Although that may have been the case, over time the AUC became a brutal criminal organization responsible for some of the worst massacres and forced displacements in Colombian history. Should paramilitary groups now form in response to the deteriorating security situation, there would be justifiable concerns that history may repeat itself.

Finally, the atrophying of the Colombian security forces' capabilities, exacerbated by the end of U.S. material and intelligence assistance, will permit illegal armed groups to extend their reach not only in Colombia but beyond as well, to neighboring Venezuela and Ecuador, where FARC dissidents and the ELN have long maintained a presence. A broadened criminal presence in Venezuela and Ecuador will surely represent a threat to stability in those countries, with knock-on effects such as a surge in emigration, with many people trying to flee to the United States.

Increased immigration is not the only consequence of a U.S.-Colombian rupture that would be felt by the United States. The loss of Colombia's security and intelligence partnership risks damaging Washington's capabilities to combat transnational crime, such as the smuggling of narcotics and human trafficking, and to stem the growth of far-flung criminal organizations that increasingly operate in the region, such as the Italian Mafia, the 'Ndrangheta, and Albanian gangs. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and Department of Justice in particular count on Colombian partners' insights, confidential informants, and wiretaps to track criminal groups and identify their current and emerging leaders. Even with help from Colombia, staying ahead of these evolving and fiercely competitive groups is difficult. Without Colombian partnership, the United States' crime-fighting capabilities in the region will be severely compromised.

Discontinuing bilateral cooperation would also end extraditions to the United States. U.S. law enforcement relies on extraditions of Colombian criminals to dismantle criminal organizations that are active within the United States and uses the information they provide in plea agreements to advance investigations. Without these processes, U.S. investigators and prosecutors will be partially blinded. And the U.S. military will find its knowledge curtailed when it comes to modern guerrilla warfare: Colombian army and marine units have pioneered new methods for planning and executing complex operations in a highly challenging environment and have advanced the U.S. military's understanding in these areas. An end to cooperation will mean losing access to the Colombians' expertise.

A collapse of the bilateral relationship could have global consequences, too. Colombia was a strong post–Cold War example of successful U.S. assistance to an ally in need. A definitive break between the two countries would discredit the United States as a reliable partner—and China would seek to benefit. Although Beijing largely ignored Colombia in the past, it has of late increased its engagement with the country, opening its markets to Colombian products and executing major infrastructure projects, such as the ongoing construction of the $4 billion Bogotá metro system. As part of its soft-power strategy in the region, Beijing has over the past several years invited hundreds of Colombian government officials, business leaders, academics, journalists, and artists to visit China. If the United States further retrenches from Colombia, Beijing will seek to deepen its influence. Chinese leaders will be able to argue, credibly, that the U.S. model of friendship and assistance proved unworkable in Colombia, heretofore Washington's closest friend and ally in South America. And other countries hedging between Washington and Beijing will take note.

There will be no rapprochement between the Petro and Trump administrations. Conflicting ideologies and worldviews have created an unbridgeable gulf of mistrust and animus. Worse, it seems that both administrations welcome this state of affairs. Petro revels in his role as an outspoken Trump critic and believes that he gains politically from it. Meanwhile, Trump continues to attack Petro over policy disagreements on narcotics, security, migration, and other issues.

The good news is that the 2026 Colombian presidential elections represent an opportunity for a reset. Colombian presidents serve a single four-year term, and all the candidates to succeed Petro from the center and right have stated their intention to repair the bilateral relationship, strengthen law enforcement and security cooperation, and support a democratic transition in Venezuela. On the left, the Petro-allied senator Iván Cepeda is now leading the polls. Although Cepeda has criticized specific U.S. policies, especially the strikes on alleged drug vessels, as a legislator he has been responsive to citizens' concerns over Colombia's unraveling security situation. If he is elected president in May, he may well learn from his predecessor's mistakes and reorient Colombia toward a more productive relationship with the United States.

Additionally, a large number of powerful stakeholders are invested in rapprochement. The former presidents Álvaro Uribe, Juan Manuel Santos, and Iván Duque have all spoken of the need to repair the relationship. And the U.S. legislative leaders most focused on Colombia, such as Mario Díaz-Balart of Florida and Gregory Meeks of New York in the House and Bernie Moreno of Ohio and Ruben Gallego of Arizona in the Senate, will likely welcome a more stable and cooperative relationship with a new Colombian president. Economic leaders, especially in the American Chambers of Commerce and the National Association of Entrepreneurs of Colombia, have made clear their interest in mending ties between the two countries. Local governments can help, too: the talented mayors of major Colombian cities are now reaching out to contacts in the Colombian and U.S. legislatures, executive branches, and news media to emphasize their support for a reset. Finally, American companies with investments or substantial business in Colombia, especially in the agricultural and energy sectors, have reason to support a more collaborative and predictable bilateral relationship.

Of course, any attempt at improving relations must take into account the unique nature of the Trump administration. The next Colombian administration would be unwise to advocate for a mere return to the status quo ante, which Trump clearly views as having benefited Colombia more than the United States. Rather, it should focus on the critical interests that Trump has identified in the region—drugs, migration, Venezuela, and Chinese influence—and determine how best to collaborate with the United States in one or more of those areas. As the successes of Plan Colombia demonstrate, a fruitful partnership between Bogotá and Washington is not just possible but desirable as well.

    Chris Mooney is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and a CNN Climate contributor. He is currently a professor of practice in the Environmental Institute at the University of Virginia.



            Planet-warming pollution rates exploded after the end of World War II. James Watt's steam engine launched the Industrial Revolution in 1769. Before that, for thousands of years, humans were clearing forested land for farming, releasing carbon from trees and plants into the atmosphere.
    


            The severity of global warming has long depended on your frame of reference — on what temperature you think was normal for the Earth before humans began changing it. But what year should mark that moment?
    


            That's what makes a groundbreaking new temperature dataset released by a group of scientists based in the United Kingdom so striking. The datasets used to diagnose the modern history of the planet's climate — and to proclaim that the world is now very near to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming — typically begin with the year 1850.
    


            The new one goes all the way back to 1781.
    


            This extended time frame matters because greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increased 2.5 percent between 1750 and 1850, enough to have caused some warming that the data hasn't accounted for.
    


            The new temperature record, dubbed GloSAT, helps contribute to the growing sense among scientists that the Earth has warmed more than what calculations based on the 1850 starting year would suggest.
    


            “That 1850 start time is one that's chosen for essentially practical considerations, given the information that's available,” said Colin Morice, lead author of the new study and a scientist with the Met Office Hadley Centre in the UK. “For sure, 1850 is not the start of industrialization.”
    


            The new dataset, published in Earth System Science Data by 16 scientists, shows a significantly cooler Earth from the late 1700s through 1849 compared with 1850-1900 — the latter being what scientists have defined as the “preindustrial” baseline period used to assess the planet's temperature change.
    


            However, not all of the warming between the two early periods can be attributed to human activities, scientists caution.
    


            Among other factors, two very powerful volcanic eruptions in the early 1800s had a marked cooling effect on the Earth. Particles from those eruptions spread around the planet's stratosphere and blocked some sunlight.
    


            “We know 1815 was Tambora, with well documented impacts,” said Ed Hawkins, a researcher with the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and one of the study's authors. “The 1808 eruption was nearly as big, but we have no idea where it happened.”
    


            Some of the warming that occurred by the late 19th century is a natural recovery from the cooling effect of these eruptions. But perhaps not only.
    


            The leading climate science authority, the U.N. Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change, concluded in 2021 that there had probably been some human-caused warming between 1750 and 1850, assessing that it was between 0 and 0.2 degrees.
    


            The scientists behind GloSAT come down right in the middle of that range.
    


            Morice and many of the same researchers contributed to a second study, accepted in the journal Environmental Research Letters, which uses the new dataset and climate models to analyze how much additional warming humans may have caused between 1750 and 1850. That study, led by Andrew Ballinger of the University of Edinburgh, determined that 0.09 degrees of warming occurred that was attributable to humans, as opposed to other factors, such as the waning effect of the large volcanic eruptions seen in the early 1800s.
    


            “This period of time is just so interesting, it's got this large amount of volcanism in it,” said Andrew Schurer, one of that study's authors and a researcher at the University of Edinburgh in the UK.
    


            Piers Forster, a climate scientist at the University of Leeds in the UK, landed on a similar number using a very different approach in a study last year. Forster used the very strong and simple relationship between the planet's temperature and how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere.
    


            It led him to conclude that the very early rise in carbon dioxide levels would have had a significant effect.
    


            “We think you get between an extra .1 and .2 degrees if you try and look at the total effect of human activity going back a bit further,” Forster said.
    


            No one was keeping track of global temperature changes 300 years ago. But there were lots of people documenting local temperature change. Combinging their efforts helps modern researchers understand what was happening at a global scale.
    


            The study of the oldest temperatures recorded by human observers is interwoven with the history of science, exploration and, frequently, the commercial activities that required businesses to collect the data.
    


            Early modern records go back to the 17th century. Following the path of the scientific revolution generally, measurements began in Europe — and then spread to North America and around the globe. The Central England Temperature series, the longest of its kind, begins in 1659, stitching together the work of many observers. A temperature record in Uppsala, Sweden began in 1722, aided by the work of Anders Celsius, himself.
    


            These very old temperature records feed into the new GloSAT analysis — and in some locations, they show a very large amount of warming.
    


            Consider a record that has been kept in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps at Hohenpeissenberg since 1781, when Augustinian clerics first began recording temperatures. They were contributing to the Societas Meteorologica Palatina, an early coordinated scientific effort that created a network of weather stations centered in today's Germany, but extending as far afield as St. Petersburg in Russia.
    


            This record is lucky to have survived, said Wolfgang Steinbrecht, a scientist with the German Weather Service who works at the observatory.
    


            “During the Napoleonic wars, all the monasteries were disbanded,” Steinbrecht said. “All the measurements were taken by people at monasteries, they were the ones who could read and write. But Hohenpeissenberg survived, now we have measurements more or less without gaps.”
    


            The Hohenpeissenberg temperature record shows nearly 3 degrees of regional warming when the last 10 years are compared with temperatures between 1781 and 1849.
    


            But how many local measurements, like this one, do you need before you can begin to deduce the  the temperature of the entire planet? And how do you deal with the oceans?
    


            After all, measurements at Uppsala, Hoehenpeissenberg and other similar locations track early temperature changes on Earth's land. But oceans cover about 70% of the planet. Reconstructing temperatures here, too, is a key addition of the GloSAT record.
    


            Ships measured temperature in the 18th century, though not as systematically as people did on land. The British East India Company for instance, often took air pressure, temperature and other measurements as they sailed and traded silk, spices and sometimes slaves between Europe and India, China, and other locations in the late 18th century.
    


            These ships provide a particularly detailed record, although scientists have had to carefully adjust the measurements because of biases — ships heat up dramatically during the day, for instance — and other factors.
    


            “The East India Company made their measurements for competitive advantage,” said Elizabeth Kent, a scientist with the National Oceanography Centre in the UK and one of the study's authors.
    


            “They wanted to know the prevailing winds so they could do their trading faster, and the temperature of the currents helped them understand if they were catching the currents,” Kent continued. “So, we know that they were seriously trying to measure these things as well as they [could].”
    


            Many whaling vessels also took temperature measurements in the Atlantic ocean off the US coastline, and their records were compiled by Matthew Fountaine Maury, a US naval officer and early oceanographer. Trade routes meant ocean air temperatures were far better measured in the Atlantic and Indian oceans than over the vast Pacific.
    


            The new dataset relies on all of these sources. It uses a measurement of marine air temperatures – not the temperature of the water itself, as in other datasets – because these were more frequently taken aboard ships in these early years. (This approach actually shows a slightly lower level of warming during the years of overlap with current temprature datasets, the authors note.)
    


            The scientists fully admit that measurements become much more sparse as one goes back further in time, and indeed, their map of the Earth's temperatures in the period from 1781-1800 comes with a lot of gaps. For this reason, the researchers ascribe a higher level of uncertainty to their estimates of the Earth's true temperature during these early years.
    


            “As the authors themselves make clear, there is larger uncertainty prior to 1850. But it is cooler, it's undoubtedly cooler,” said Peter Thorne, a climate scientist at Maynooth University in Ireland, who served as a reviewer for the new study.
    


            If that additional bit of warming did occur, though, what might it mean for how we understand the state of the planet today, and how much humans have changed it?
    


            It might seem daunting or disheartening to contemplate that climate change is an even bigger problem than we thought, or that we've done more to cause it than we realized. But it's not so simple, scientists say.
    


            Zeke Hausfather, a researcher with Berkeley Earth who is familiar with the GloSAT work, says he thinks it's a significant advance. But he cautions about leaping to the conclusion that this realization of some additional early warming undermines climate goals, such as those written into the Paris climate agreement, as those are generally understood to be based on the 1850 to 1900 baseline.
    


            “I think it tells us something about pre-1850 warming,” Hausfather said, “I just don't think we should read too much into what that implies for our ability to meet climate goals.”
    


            Thorne, who reviewed the new study, agrees to a point. But he says the finding of earlier warming isn't irrelevant — you just need to think carefully about what it means and doesn't mean.
    


            “It does mean we warmed the Earth more, but it doesn't mean the impacts are suddenly going to occur sooner,” Thorne said. “They are where they are. And they've almost invariably been calculated relative to a much more recent reference period.”
    


            Still, that additional warming can't be ignored in assessing the total human impact on the Earth. It could even be part of what forced changes in some Earth systems.
    


            Ultimately, for Thorne, it's all part of a picture in which we should be increasingly concerned about the potential for mounting impacts.
    


            “It changes our perception of how far we have already pushed the climate system in important ways,” he said.

            For nine hours, students at Brown University crouched under desks and behind locked door, making panicked phone calls and sending “I love you” texts that felt dangerously close to goodbyes.
    


An active shooter was on campus — and police were still searching for a suspect.
    


            Late Saturday night into Sunday morning, they listened for footsteps, for sirens, for anything that might signal the end of another American nightmare.
    


            It is a kind of story Americans know too well, and one that repeats with numbing regularity — again and again and again.
    


            By the time Brown's campus lockdown lifted at 5:40 a.m., two students were dead and nine others had been injured, according to the university. One victim remains in critical condition, another is listed as stable and one person was treated and released.
    


            So far in 2025, there have been at least 391 mass shootings and 13,929 shooting deaths in the United States, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Each number represents a shattered family, a traumatized community, another generation learning too early how to survive gunfire.
    


            At the private university in Providence, Rhode Island, the nightmare began on a winter afternoon just two weeks before Christmas. Students were studying for finals at the library or taking exams. Others were attending review sessions, and some were hanging out with friends visiting the Ivy League campus when the first alert reached their phones at 4:22 p.m.
    


            “Urgent: There's an active shooter near Barus & Holley Engineering,” the alert read.
    


            Students should lock the doors, silence phones and hide until further notice, it said, adding to run and evacuate safely if you could.
    


            “FIGHT, as a last resort, take action to protect yourself,” the alert said.
    


            Ten more alerts would follow, reminding the community to stay sheltered in place and keep doors locked, letting students know where police were and which buildings were being evacuated, and, finally, telling them the shelter-in-place order had ended.
    


            Saturday's shooting came on the eve of the 13th anniversary of the Sandy Hook school massacre, which claimed the lives of 26 people, including 20 elementary students.
    


            At least two students at Brown had survived previous school shootings.
    


            Zoe Weissman was in middle school when she witnessed the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead.
    


            The sophomore said she is overwhelmed not just by grief but by anger.
    


            “I think the sadness will set in when we get all the victims identified and find out who we lost as a community,” Weissman told CNN.
    


            “But right now, I'm just angry that there are kids like me in this country who have had to go through this not once but twice.”
    


            Students were hustling around campus, coming and going on the penultimate Saturday of the semester. Many were entering the engineering building at Barus and Holley where final exams and review sessions were underway. The exterior doors were unlocked.
    


            In room 166, one of the largest classrooms in the building, Joseph Oduro, a 21-year-old teaching assistant, was holding his final review session of the year. The session ended just after 4 p.m., a little later than planned.
    


            Oduro, who helps teach economics to undergraduates, was delivering closing remarks to his class and watching his students stand up to leave when the sound of gunfire cut through the room.
    


            Then came the screams.
    


            Moments later, Oduro said, the gunman entered the auditorium from the back of the room and locked eyes with him.
    


            “He came in, pointed the gun, and then screamed something,” Oduro recalled. “Then he just started shooting right after that.”
    


            The first shots ripped into the chalkboard, exactly where Oduro had been standing seconds earlier. One of his students was shot in the legs.
    


            Oduro and about 20 students ducked and huddled behind a desk in front of the auditorium, the only refuge available, and called 911. There wasn't much space behind the desk, Oduro said. He estimated it to be about 10 feet long.
    


            “We made do,” Oduro said. “Because at the end of the day, we just all wanted to survive.”
    


            It “felt like an eternity” before the gunfire stopped, Oduro said. He didn't lift his head until campus public safety officers entered the room and told them it was safe to leave.
    


            Sophia Holman was searching for a classroom to study in at the engineering building when she heard gunshots.
    


            At first, she thought it was sound from the school's woodshop, or an “experiment gone wrong,” she told CNN.
    


            But then she saw someone run past her — so she started running, too. She ran one block east and then called police.
    


            Police searched the engineering building but couldn't find any suspect. Over 400 local, state and federal law enforcement officials fanned out across the Brown campus, searching for the gunman they believed exited the building on Hope Street.
    


            Law enforcement later said the suspect was dressed in dark clothing and believed to be in his 30s. The figure's face, officials said, was obscured, and witnesses told police he may have been wearing a gray camouflage mask.
    


            An early alert from the university initially said police had a person in custody. But the person was later determined not to be the shooting suspect, the school said, and students were urged to remain vigilant.
    


            Ethan Schenker, who was studying in the basement of a campus library when the lockdown began, described the hours as startling. Everyone in the library, he said, was “very on edge” as law enforcement cleared every classroom and patrolled the building.
    


            “It didn't seem real,” Schenker, a former CNN intern, said.
    


Students sheltering in a library huddled on the ground as police banged on the door, video shows. Officers in tactical gear with long guns entered and cleared the room and escorted the students out.
    


            About 160 students were in lockdown in the gym, according to Lydell Dyer, a Brown student and former CNN intern.
    


            “We gathered everybody up. Went to the third floor of our building. We locked the doors. We had to turn off the lights, close the blinds, and then we sat there in silence and darkness for hours,” Dyer said. They were eventually moved to the school's track facility building, he said.
    


            “I was there until 3:30 in the morning until they finally found a way to get us a shuttle and get us back to our dorms,” Dyer said.
    


            By early Sunday morning, about 12 hours after the shooting, the school sent another alert, saying the shelter-in-place order had ended.
    


            Investigators, meanwhile, had zeroed in on a person of interest — and a Hampton Inn — about 20 miles from Providence.
    


            At a Hampton Inn in Coventry, Rhode Island, unsuspecting visitors and travelers were jolted awake shortly before dawn.
    


            Law enforcement banged on one hotel door, ordering the man inside to open up, sources said. At least 20 officers — including local police, US marshals and FBI agents — filled the hotel corridors as they entered the room, CNN witnessed. Once inside, they asked where he had been that day and evening.
    


            In the hotel the whole time, he responded.
    


            “We have a warrant for your apartment,” one officer said. Moments later, the man inside was told he would be taken “back to the cruiser.”
    


            But late Sunday night, officials released the man. The evidence “points in a different direction,” said Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha.
    


            “It's fair to say that there is no basis to consider him a person of interest,” Neronha said. “So, that's why he's being released.”
    


            There are still a “lot of steps left to take” in the investigation, Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said.
    


            “After 30 years in law enforcement, there were a lot of twists and a lot of roads that I've walked down,” McKee said. “I can't tell you what direction it's going to take right now, but we're going to solve (this case).”
    


            By Sunday afternoon, not all victims' families had been notified, a delay made more painful by timing and distance, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said.
    


            For survivors, the horror of what unfolded inside the building is still coming into focus.
    


            Mia Tretta knows the cost of gun violence in ways few people ever should.
    


            A junior at Brown University, Tretta survived the 2019 Saugus High School shooting in Santa Clarita, California. Tretta was shot in the stomach and lives with lasting physical complications.
    


            When it came time to choose a college, Tretta deliberately sought out a campus that felt small, contained and safe, a place she believed might finally put distance between her and the violence that had already marked her life, she said.
    


            So, when her phone first buzzed with an alert warning of a shooter in Brown's engineering building, she initially dismissed it.
    


            “I didn't really think it was real,” she said.
    


            That disbelief shattered as message after message flooded in.
    


            As authorities searched for the gunman, panic spread across campus, and confusion ruled the night, Tretta said.
    


            “It was just a really confusing time for everyone. I have friends who were stuck in basements of buildings and/or in the hallway of the library,” she said.
    


            The night, Tretta said, carried brutal familiarity and proof that survival offers no immunity.
    


            “Unfortunately,” she said, “gun violence doesn't care if you've already been shot in a school shooting.”
    


            Smiley noted the generational impact of such violence: “We have a generation of kids who have had to do active shooter trainings. That's not something I had to do when I was a kid,” the mayor said.
    


            For Oduro, the teaching assistant, the weight of what happened has barely begun to settle. He is now a survivor and a part of a generation all too familiar with mass shootings.
    


            “Unfortunately, that's just part of the society we live in today,” he said.
    


            His heart goes out to students who didn't make it out of the room or are in the hospital.
    


            “I haven't really had the chance to process things myself, but I just want to make sure everybody else is OK,” Oduro said.
    


            For Weissman, the Parkland high school graduate, the Brown attack reopened wounds from 2018. She immediately called her mother after Saturday's gunfire, just as she did years ago.
    


            “It feels like I'm 12 again,” she said. “It feels like it's 2018 again for my family as well. We're going through the exact same emotions.”

            Donald Trump's return to the White House set off a gold rush on Wall Street and in the crypto world.
    


            Companies and crypto projects linked to Trump and his family exploded in value as traders bet they would benefit from the president's return to power.
    


            A year later, some of those Trump-related bets have paid off. But many others have imploded, costing investors who rushed in during the initial boom dearly.
    


            The crash back to earth for many of these assets reflects the fact that many of these bets were hard to make sense of in the first place.
    


            “Sometimes irrational exuberance meets the brick wall of logic,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth.
    


            Exhibit A is Trump Media & Technology Group, the owner of Truth Social, whose ticker symbol is DJT, the president's initials.
    


            Trump Media became a proxy for Trump's election fortunes. Traders who sniffed out Trump's looming victory gobbled up the stock, which tripled in value in the five weeks leading up to late October 2024.
    


            Even though Trump Media had never made money and generated little revenue, the company was valued on Wall Street at a staggering $11 billion just days before the election.
    


            Flash forward to today: Trump Media plunged below $11 a share on Friday, leaving it down roughly 80% from the pre-election peak and worth less than $3 billion.
    


            Despite the fact that Trump uses Truth Social as his preferred platform for presidential communications, the social media network hasn't become the go-to platform traders suspected it might be. Truth Social drew just 1.5 million monthly active US users on iOS and Android in November, a far cry from X's 54.2 million and Reddit's 59.8 million, according to Similarweb data shared with CNN.
    


            Even Bluesky is more popular, with 2.4 million monthly active users.
    


            Trump Media has pivoted this year to expand into financial services, crypto and artificial intelligence, but it's too early to say if those moves will pay off.
    


            Some other Trump-related bets have fared even worse than Trump Media.
    


            For instance, the official Trump meme coin launched just days before he was sworn in, much to the dismay of ethics experts.
    


            The Trump coin rapidly spiked to as high as $45.57 on January 19, giving it a $9 billion value, according to Coinmarketcap.
    


            The gains padded Trump's net worth, at least on paper, because 80% of the supply was held by Trump Organization-affiliates.
    


            But today, the Trump meme coin is trading at around $5.60, or just $1.1 billion. It has lost 88% of its value from the peak.
    


            First Lady Melania Trump's meme coin suffered even steeper losses.
    


            Melania coin peaked at $8.48 on January 19, giving it a market capitalization of $1.6 billion, according to Coinmarketcap.
    


            But by February the Melanie meme coin fell below $2, and today it's worth just 11 cents, valued at barely $100 million. That means anyone who bought at the top and held on has lost 99% of their investment.
    


            More recently, American Bitcoin, a bitcoin miner backed by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, debuted on the Nasdaq in September after merging with Gryphon Digital Mining.
    


            American Bitcoin's share price initially popped, climbing to as high as $9.31 on September 9. But those gains have since vanished amid a broader crypto pullback, and American Bitcoin dropped below $2 last week.
    


            Likewise, World Liberty Financial, a firm Trump and Steve Witkoff co-founded last year along with their sons, started trading a new token in September. It rose to 25 cents in late September but has yet to take off and on Friday fell to 14 cents.
    


            Trump's election also drove up shares of private prison stocks as investors expected looming immigration crackdowns would drive up demand for detention facilities.
    


            For instance, shares of GEO Group, which operates immigration detention centers for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), spiked to an all-time high of $35.35 days before Trump took office. That represented a 175% spike from where it ended the prior September.
    


            But private prison companies haven't experienced the surge in demand that many anticipated as the Trump administration has relied more heavily in deportations.
    


            GEO Group's share price has lost more than half its value from the peak.
    


            “I've given up on private prisons,” said Matthew Tuttle, CEO and chief investment officer at Tuttle Capital Management. “A lot of people, myself included, thought ICE would round up people and they would sit in private prisons. I was not expecting sending people to El Salvador and other places.”
    


            Some Trump-related bets did pay off though.
    


            For example, European aerospace and defense stocks continue to fly high as they benefit from higher demand caused in part by Trump's pressure on NATO allies to ramp up defense spending.
    


            The Select STOXX Europe Aerospace & Defense ETF, a US-listed fund launched by Tuttle that invests in European defense companies, is up more than 70% so far this year.
    


            Tuttle said the European defense contractors were “such an under-loved trade” prior to the election but the ETF received $1 billion of inflows shortly after Trump won.
    


            “It was crazy,” Tuttle said.
    


            Another big winner is bitcoin.
    


            Bitcoin skyrocketed after the victory by Trump, who promised to make America the crypto capital of the world by launching a national stockpile and replacing Biden-era regulators who were skeptical of the leading cryptocurrency.
    


            Even though bitcoin has pulled back sharply from record highs set this past October, its current price of around $90,000 is well above the $63,000 level it ended September 2024 at.

Legendary Hollywood director Rob Reiner and his wife Michele Reiner have died, according to their family. Homicide detectives from LAPD are investigating it as an “apparent homicide.”

President Trump offered condolences after the deadly attack at Sydney's Bondi Beach and the shooting at Brown University, saying those responsible would face consequences.

As a delegation of Americans, including special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Berlin, in hopes of negotiating an end to the conflict with Russia, CNN's Fred Pleitgen breaks down the progress that has been made.

The father of the Bondi Beach bystander who was seen in a viral social media video tackling and disarming one of the alleged gunmen during Sunday's mass shooting praised his son's bravery in an interview with national broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

Police are continuing to search for a shooter after two people were killed and nine others were injured at Brown University. Providence police released a person of interest in the investigation. Rhode Island's Attorney General Peter Neronha said the evidence ""now points in a different direction,"" but didn't give any further details.

President Donald Trump pledges retaliation after two US soldiers and one civilian interpreter were killed in an ambush in Syria. CNN's Julia Benbrook reports.

Four players from Ohio State are among 10 first-team picks from the Big Ten on The Associated Press All-America team released Monday, a group headed by repeat selection Caleb Downs of the Buckeyes and AP Player of the Year Fernando Mendoza of Indiana.

The AP has named an All-America team every year since 1925, and Notre Dame's two first-team picks this season increased its all-time lead to 87.

Downs, the Big Ten defensive player of the year, has made the first team each of his two seasons at Ohio State after landing on the second team as a freshman at Alabama in 2023. He is one of 12 players on the 27-man first team who did not start their careers at their current school. Downs is joined on the first team by fellow Buckeyes Jeremiah Smith, Kayden McDonald and Arvell Reese.

Mendoza, who won the Heisman Trophy over the weekend, led the top-ranked Hoosiers to a 13-0 record and the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff after transferring from California. He has thrown a nation-leading 33 touchdown passes and is the catalyst of one of the most productive offenses in the country.

A total of 18 schools are represented on the first team, including seven of the 12 in the CFP. 

Iowa has had at least one first-team player seven straight years and in 10 of the last 12. This is the fourth year in a row Miami, Notre Dame and Ohio State have had at least one.

Punter Cole Maynard gave Western Kentucky its first-ever first-team pick. Defensive lineman Landon Robinson is Navy's first since 1975 and kicker Kansei Matsuzawa is Hawaii's first since 1986.

Officials in Providence, Rhode Island say they will release a person of interest detained in a Brown University shooting that killed two students and injured nine. Officials made the disclosure at a hastily convened news conference on Sunday night, more than 12 hours after revealing that they had detained a person in connection with the attack.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Police renewed their search Monday for the gunman who killed two Brown University students and wounded nine others, a day after they released a person of interest after determining the evidence pointed in a different direction.

Officials announced the man's release at news conference late Sunday, marking a setback in the investigation of Saturday's attack on the Ivy League school's campus. It also added to mounting questions about the shooting and investigation, including an apparent lack of video evidence and whether the focus on the person of interest might have given the killer more time to escape justice. 

Providence residents and students were relieved early Sunday when officials announced they had detained a man at a Rhode Island hotel in connection with the attack and lifted a lockdown. But that relief was short-lived, as Mayor Brett Smiley said hours later that investigators didn't know whether the gunman was still in the area.

Colin Moussette, who has friends at Brown and is considering enrolling next fall, said he felt uneasy knowing that the suspect has not been caught.

“How someone got away, like in the middle of the day is, to me, not only heartbreaking but very concerning,” he said while visiting the campus Monday. “How they got access to the building is concerning.”

The last known sighting of the gunman was minutes after shooting. Authorities released a short clip of video of the suspect walking away from the scene, but his face wasn't visible.

The release of the person of interest left law enforcement without a known suspect, with officials pledging to redouble their efforts by asking neighborhood residents and businesses for video surveillance that might help identify the attacker.




“We have a murderer out there,” state Attorney General Peter Neronha said.

Authorities said Sunday that one of the reasons they lacked video of the shooter was because Brown's engineering building doesn't have many cameras.

The mayor said there have been no credible threats of further violence since the shooting, and the city's schools were open Monday. 

Colleges and universities, including in the Providence and some Ivy League schools, are increasing security in the wake of the shootings. Yale said extra security would also be in place for Hanukkah celebrations.

On Sunday morning, officials took into custody a person of interest at a Hampton Inn in Coventry, Rhode Island, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from Providence. Two people familiar with the matter identified that individual as a 24-year-old man from Wisconsin, though authorities never released his name.

“I've been around long enough to know that sometimes you head in one direction and then you have to regroup and go in another, and that's exactly what has happened over the last 24 hours or so,” Neronha said.

He said there was some evidence that pointed to the man authorities detained, but “that evidence needed to be corroborated and confirmed. And over the last 24 hours leading into just very, very recently, that evidence now points in a different direction.”

“Right now, we don't have any evidence to suggest that it was more than that individual,” Smiley said Monday on ABC's “Good Morning America.” 

Despite an enhanced police presence at Brown, officials are not recommending another shelter-in-place order like the one that followed the Saturday afternoon shooting, when hundreds of officers searched for the attacker and urged students and staff to remain indoors.

The shooting occurred as final exams were underway at Brown, one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious schools.

The gunman opened fire inside a classroom in the engineering building, getting off more than 40 rounds from a 9 mm handgun, a law enforcement official told AP. Two handguns were recovered when the person of interest was taken into custody and authorities also found two loaded 30-round magazines, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke to AP on the condition of anonymity.

Investigators were not immediately sure how the shooter got inside the first-floor classroom.

The attack set off hours of chaos on campus and in the surrounding neighborhoods, as hundreds of officers searched for the shooter. During the lockdown, which wasn't lifted until Sunday, after the person of interest was taken into custody, many students barricaded there rooms and hid behind furniture and bookshelves. 

One of the nine wounded students has been released from the hospital, Paxson said Sunday. Seven others were in critical but stable condition, and one was in critical condition.

The mayor said he visited some wounded students and was inspired by their courage, hope and gratitude. “The resilience that these survivors showed and shared with me, is frankly pretty overwhelming,” Smiley said.

Director-actor Rob Reiner and his wife Michele were the two people found dead Sunday at a Los Angeles home owned by Reiner, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.

Actor, director and activist Rob Reiner has died at age 78. Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead Sunday afternoon in their home in Los Angeles, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. Authorities were investigating it as an “apparent homicide.” Reiner was an actor and director, helming films like “When Harry Met Sally” and “The Princess Bride. (Dec. 15)

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Rob Reiner's younger son, Nick Reiner, was in police custody Monday for what investigators believe was the fatal stabbing of the director-actor and his wife at their Los Angeles home a day earlier, police said. 

Police Chief Jim McDonnell said Nick Reiner, 32, has been “booked for murder” and is being held on $4 million bail in connection with the deaths of his parents. McDonnell said the department's robbery and homicide division is handling the investigation. 

“They worked throughout the night on this case and were able to take into custody Nick Reiner, a suspect in this case,” McDonnell said. He was held on $4 million bail. 

McDonnell called the deaths “a very tragic incident.”

Representatives for Reiner's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment and it wasn't immediately clear if Nick Reiner had an attorney who could speak on his behalf. 

Nick Reiner has spoken publicly of his struggles with addiction. By 18, he had cycled in and out of treatment facilities with bouts of homelessness and relapses in between. Rob and Nick Reiner explored their difficult relationship and Nick Reiner's struggles with drugs in a semi-autobiographical 2016 film, “ Being Charlie.” 

Rob and Michele Singer Reiner were found dead Sunday at their home in Los Angeles, and investigators believe they suffered stab wounds, the law enforcement official said.




The Los Angeles Fire Department said it responded to a medical aid request shortly after 3:30 p.m. and found a 78-year-old man and 68-year-old woman dead inside. Reiner turned 78 in March. 

Detectives with the Robbery Homicide Division were investigating an “apparent homicide” at Reiner's home, said Capt. Mike Bland with the Los Angeles Police Department.

Los Angeles authorities have not confirmed the identities of the people found dead at the residence in the upscale Brentwood neighborhood on the city's west side that's home to many celebrities.

Reiner was long one of the most prolific directors in Hollywood, and his work included some of the most memorable movies of the 1980s and '90s, including “This is Spinal Tap,” “A Few Good Men,” “When Harry Met Sally,” and “The Princess Bride.”

His role as Meathead in Norman Lear's 1970s TV classic “All in the Family,” as a liberal foil to O'Connor's Archie Bunker, catapulted him to fame and won him two Emmy Awards.

The son of comedy legend Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner was married to photographer Michele Singer Reiner since 1989. The two met while he was directing “When Harry Met Sally” and had three children together: Nick, Jake and Romy.

Relatives of Lear, the legendary producer who died in 2023, said their deaths left them bereft. 

“Norman often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary, to us and the world,” said a Lear family statement. “Norman would have wanted to remind us that Rob and Michele spent every breath trying to make this country a better place, and they pursued that through their art, their activism, their philanthropy, and their love for family and friends.”

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called it a devastating loss for the city. 

“Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,” Bass said in a statement. “An acclaimed actor, director, producer, writer, and engaged political activist, he always used his gifts in service of others.”

Reiner was previously married to actor-director Penny Marshall from 1971 to 1981. He adopted her daughter, Tracy Reiner. Carl Reiner died in 2020 at age 98 and Marshall died in 2018.

Killings are rare in the Brentwood neighborhood. The scene is about a mile from the home where O.J. Simpson's wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman were killed in 1994.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The fight over California's new congressional map designed to help Democrats flip congressional House seats will go to court Monday as a panel of federal judges considers whether the district boundaries approved by voters last month can be used in elections. 

The hearing in Los Angeles sets the stage for a high-stakes legal and political fight between the Trump administration and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who's been eyeing a 2028 presidential run. The lawsuit asks a three-judge panel to grant a temporary restraining order by Dec. 19 — the date candidates can take the first official steps to run in the 2026 election.

Voters approved California's new U.S. House map in November through Proposition 50. It's designed to help Democrats flip as many as five congressional House seats in the midterm elections next year. It was Newsom's response to a Republican-led effort in Texas backed by President Donald Trump. 

The redistricting showdown between the nation's two most populous states has spread nationally, with efforts aiming to determine which party controls Congress for the second half of Trump's term. Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio have adopted new district lines that could provide a partisan advantage. 

Some plans are facing legal challenges, but the Supreme Court ruled earlier this month to allow Texas to use its new map for the 2026 election. The Justice Department has only sued California.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




The U.S. Justice Department, joining a case brought by the California Republican Party, has accused California of gerrymandering its map in violation of the Constitution by using race as a factor to favor Hispanic voters. Republicans want the court to prohibit California from using the new map. Voters approved the map for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections. State Democrats said they're confident the lawsuit will fail. 




“In letting Texas use its gerrymandered maps, the Supreme Court noted that California's maps, like Texas's, were drawn for lawful reasons,” Newsom's spokesperson Brandon Richards said in a statement. “That should be the beginning and the end of this Republican effort to silence the voters of California.”

New U.S. House maps are drawn across the country after the Census every 10 years. Some states like California rely on an independent commission to draw maps, while others like Texas let politicians draw them. The effort to create new maps in the middle of the decade is highly unusual.

Paul Mitchell, a redistricting consultant who drew the map for Democrats, is expected to offer testimony. The Justice Department alleges that Mitchell and state leaders admitted that they redrew some districts to have a Latino majority. 

The lawsuit cites a news release from state Democrats that says the new map “retains and expands Voting Rights Act districts that empower Latino voters” while making no changes to Black majority districts in the Oakland and Los Angeles areas. The federal Voting Rights Act, passed in the 1960s, sets rules for drawing districts to ensure minority groups have adequate political power. The lawsuit also cites a Cal Poly Pomona and Caltech study that concludes the new map would increase Latino voting power.

“Race cannot be used as a proxy to advance political interests, but that is precisely what the California General Assembly did with Proposition 50 — the recent ballot initiative that junked California's pre-existing electoral map in favor of a rush-job rejiggering of California's congressional district lines,” the lawsuit said.

House Democrats need to gain just a handful of seats next year to take control of the chamber, which would imperil Trump's agenda for the remainder of his term and open the way for congressional investigations into his administration. Republicans hold 219 seats, to Democrats' 214.

Rob Reiner, the son of a comedy giant who became one himself as one of the preeminent filmmakers of his generation with movies such as “The Princess Bride,” “When Harry Met Sally …” and “This Is Spinal Tap,” has died. He was 78.

Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found fatally stabbed Sunday at their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Police Department on Monday arrested the Reiners' 32-year-old son, Nick Reiner, and booked him on suspicion of killing his parents. 

It was a tragic, shocking end to a life and career that began with a complicated father-son relationship. Reiner grew up thinking his father, the legendary funnyman Carl Reiner, didn't understand him or find him funny. But the younger Reiner would in many ways follow in his father's footsteps, working both in front and behind the camera, in comedies that stretched from broad sketch work to accomplished dramedies.

“My father thought, ‘Oh, my God, this poor kid is worried about being in the shadow of a famous father,'” Reiner told “60 Minutes” in October, recalling the temptation to change his name. “And he says, ‘What do you want to change your name to?' And I said, ‘Carl.' I just wanted to be like him.”

After starting out as a writer for “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,” Reiner's breakthrough came when he was, at age 23, cast in Norman Lear's “All in the Family” as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael “Meathead” Stivic. But by the 1980s, Reiner began as a feature film director, churning out some of the most beloved films of that, or any, era. His first film, the largely improvised 1984 cult classic “This Is Spinal Tap,” remains the quintessential mockumentary. 

After the 1985 John Cusack summer comedy, “The Sure Thing,” Reiner made “Stand By Me” (1986), “The Princess Bride” (1987) and “When Harry Met Sally …” (1989), a four-year stretch that resulted in a trio of American classics, all of them among the most often quoted movies of the 20th century.

For the next four decades, Reiner, a warm and gregarious presence on screen and an outspoken liberal advocate off it, remained a constant fixture in Hollywood. The production company he co-founded, Castle Rock Entertainment, launched an enviable string of hits, including “Seinfeld” and “The Shawshank Redemption.” By the turn of the century, its success rate had fallen considerably, but Reiner revived it, and this fall released the long-in-coming sequel “Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.”

All the while, Reiner was one of the film industry's most passionate Democrat activists, regularly hosting fundraisers and campaigning for liberal issues. He was co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which challenged in court California's ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8. He also chaired the campaign for Prop 10, a California initiative to fund early childhood development services with a tax on tobacco products. And Reiner was an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump. 

“Beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people — and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action,” former President Barack Obama said in a statement. 

Political engagement ran in the family, too. Reiner's father opposed the Communist hunt of McCarthyism in the 1950s and his mother, Estelle Reiner, a singer and actor, protested the Vietnam War. 

“If you're a nepo baby, doors will open,” Reiner told the Guardian in 2024. “But you have to deliver. If you don't deliver, the door will close just as fast as it opened.”



Robert Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947. As a young man, he quickly set out to follow his father into entertainment. He studied at the University of California, Los Angeles film school and, in the 1960s, began appearing in small parts in various television shows.

But when Lear saw Reiner as a key cast member in “All in the Family,” it came as a surprise to the elder Reiner.

“Norman says to my dad, ‘You know, this kid is really funny.' And I think my dad said, ‘What? That kid? That kid? He's sullen. He sits quiet. He doesn't, you know, he's not funny.' He didn't think I was anyway,” Reiner told “60 Minutes.” 

On “All in the Family,” Reiner served as a pivotal foil to Carroll O'Connor's bigoted, conservative Archie Bunker. Reiner was seven times nominated for an Emmy for his performance on the show, winning in 1974 and 1978. In Lear, Reiner also found a mentor. He called him “a second father.” 

“It wasn't just that he hired me for ‘All in the Family,'” Reiner told “American Masters” in 2005. “It was that I saw, in how he conducted his life, that there was room to be an activist as well. That you could use your celebrity, your good fortune, to help make some change.”

Lear also helped launch Reiner as a filmmaker. He put $7.5 million of his own money to help finance “Stand By Me,” Reiner's adaptation of the Stephen King novella “The Body.” The movie, about four boys who go looking for the dead body of a missing boy, became a coming-of-age classic, made breakthroughs of its young cast (particularly River Phoenix) and even earned the praise of King.

“Rest in peace, Rob,” King said Monday on X. “You always stood by me.”

With his stock rising, Reiner devoted himself to adapting William Goldman's 1973's “The Princess Bride,” a book Reiner had loved since his father gave him a copy as a gift. Everyone from François Truffaut to Robert Redford had considered adapting Goldman's book. It ultimately fell to Reiner (from Goldman's own script) to capture the unique comic tone of “The Princess Bride.” But only once he had Goldman's blessing.

“At the door he greeted me and he said, ‘This is my baby. I want this on my tombstone. This is my favorite thing I've ever written in my life. What are you going to do with it?'” Reiner recalled in a Television Academy interview. “And we sat down with him and started going through what I thought should be done with the film.”

Though only a modest success in theaters, the movie — starring Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, André the Giant and Robin Wright — would grow in stature over the years, leading to countless impressions of Inigo Montoya's vow of revenge and the risky nature of land wars in Asia. 



Reiner was married to Penny Marshall, the actor and filmmaker, for 10 years beginning in 1971. Like Reiner, Marshall experienced sitcom fame, with “Laverne & Shirley,” but found a more lasting legacy behind the camera. 

After their divorce, Reiner, at a lunch with Nora Ephron, suggested a comedy about dating. In writing what became “When Harry Met Sally …” Ephron and Reiner charted a relationship between a man and a woman (played in the film by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan) over the course of 12 years.

Along the way, the movie's ending changed, as did some of the film's indelible moments. The famous line, “I'll have what she's having,” said after witnessing Ryan's fake orgasm at Katz's Delicatessen, was a suggestion by Crystal — delivered by none other than Reiner's mother, Estelle.

The movie's happy ending also had some real-life basis. Reiner met Michele Singer, a photographer, on the set of “When Harry Met Sally …” In 1989, they were wed. They had three children together: Nick, Jake and Romy.

Reiner's subsequent films included another King adaptation, “Misery” (1990) and a pair of Aaron Sorkin-penned dramas: the military courtroom tale “A Few Good Men” (1992) and 1995's “The American President.”

By the late '90s, Reiner's films (1996's “Ghosts of Mississippi,” 2007's “The Bucket List”) no longer had the same success rate. But he remained a frequent actor, often memorably enlivening films like “Sleepless in Seattle” (1993) and “The Wolf of Wall Street” (2013). In 2023, he directed the documentary “Albert Brooks: Defending My Life.”

In an interview earlier this year with Seth Rogen, Reiner suggested everything in his career boiled down to one thing.

“All I've ever done is say, ‘Is this something that is an extension of me?' For ‘Stand by Me,' I didn't know if it was going to be successful or not. All I thought was, ‘I like this because I know what it feels like.'”

Former Vice President Kamala thanked her supporters Friday at the Democratic National Committee's annual winter meeting for ""standing up for our democracy"" and ""the rule of law."" 

It appears to be game on in the race for the next Democratic presidential nomination, as two of the party's most high-profile politicians, who are considered potential top-tier 2028 contenders, stirred more speculation at a major Democratic Party summit.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrats' 2024 standard-bearer after then-President Joe Biden exited the race, showcased an edgier stump speech as she railed against both major parties and the political status quo in an address at the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) winter meeting this past weekend.

And California Gov. Gavin Newsom landed the red carpet treatment, as he mingled with delegates during the opening day of the DNC's confab, which was held this year in Los Angeles, home turf to both Harris and Newsom.

The main focus for the hundreds of committee members and party officials who attended the summit was reviewing the party's decisive victories in last month's 2025 elections and better than expected performances in this year's special elections, and training sessions to prepare for next year's crucial midterm contests.

But with the unofficial start of the next White House race less than a year away, and what's likely to be a bruising battle among Democrats over the party's presidential nominating calendar getting underway, 2028 was also in the spotlight.

""Obviously, we must focus on the midterms,"" Harris said in her Friday speech. ""But Democrats, we must also have a clear vision for what comes after the midterms. And then after Trump. We need to answer the question. We need to answer the question: what comes next for our party and our democracy?""

Harris argued that ""both parties have failed to hold the public's trust"" and that ""people are done with the status quo, and they're ready to break things to force change.""

2028 LOOMS LARGE: HARRIS, NEWSOM, PRITZKER CONVERGE AT MAJOR DNC MEETING

And Harris, who was swept by President Donald Trump in all key battleground states in the 2024 election, said that Trump is representative of a bigger problem plaguing the nation's politics.

""He and the rise of the MAGA movement, I believe, are a symptom of a failed system that is the result of years of outsourcing and offshoring, financial deregulation, growing income inequality, a broken campaign finance system and endless partisan gridlock all contributing to how we got here today,"" she emphasized.

""The vice president received a very warm and enthusiastic reception,"" a committee member told Fox News Digital.

And when she alluded to who would be in contention for the 2028 nomination, some in the room shouted, ""You.""

According to those in the room, Harris also landed a warm welcome less than 24 hours earlier as she spoke at the United Farm Workers annual gala.

Expect to see more of Harris in the new year, helping Democrats from coast to coast as the party works to win back congressional majorities in the midterms.

And Harris has added more 2026 stops to her book tour promoting ""107 Days,"" her reflections on her abbreviated 2024 presidential campaign. Among the stops is one in South Carolina, a crucial early-voting primary state in the Democratic Party's presidential nominating calendar.

SUCCEEDING TRUMP IN 2028: SIX REPUBLICANS TO KEEP YOUR EYES ON

While Newsom didn't address the delegates at Friday's general session, he was treated like a VIP on Thursday as he held meetings and mingled with delegates during the opening day of the winter meeting.

A DNC committee member who witnessed the commotion told Fox News Digital, ""Newsom received a rock star reception as he was mobbed by party leaders and activists alike while he attempted to walk from meeting to meeting.""

Newsom on Thursday met with the Democratic Party chairs from New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state, and Nevada, another crucial early voting state.

""We had a great discussion on a wide range of issues,"" longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley told Fox News Digital.

Newsom's stature in his own party has soared this year, thanks to his very vocal and visual pushback against the president, including his viral social media trolling of Trump and his successful California push to counter the Republican congressional redistricting effort.

""Newsom has shown an ability to stand up to Trump in a bold and highly effective manner without shying away from core democratic values,"" veteran Democratic strategist Joe Caiazzo told Fox News Digital.

While both Newsom and Harris made a splash at the DNC winter meeting, they both have plenty of detractors who worry that neither would be electable in 2028 when the Democrats try to win back the White House.

And if one or both of them launch presidential campaigns, they'll likely be joined by a large crowd of other contenders.

One of those possible White House hopefuls is Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who was also making the rounds during the opening day of the DNC meeting.

Fox News Digital confirmed that the billionaire governor helped raise over $1 million for the DNC at a fundraiser Thursday night.

A DNC insider said the appearances by Harris, Newsom and Pritzker gave ""them an opportunity to start honing in on a winning message for Democrats in 2028.""

The Department of the Army on Monday identified two Iowa National Guard soldiers who were killed in Palmyra, Syria.

Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, 25, of Des Moines, Iowa, and Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, 29, of Marshalltown, Iowa, were killed Saturday while supporting Operation Inherent Resolve.  

Torres-Tovar and Howard were assigned to 1st Squadron, 113th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division of the Iowa National Guard.

The Army said the incident remains under investigation.

 Meskwaki Nation Police Chief Jeffrey Bunn had identified his son Nate as one of the U.S. service members who was killed in the attack in a Sunday Facebook post.

""My wife Misty and I had that visit from Army Commanders you never want to have. Our son Nate was one of the Soldiers that paid the ultimate sacrifice for all of us, to keep us all safer. He loved what he was doing and would be the first in and last out, no one left behind. Please pray for our Soldiers all around this cruel world. We will see you again son, until then we have i[t] from here,"" Bunn wrote.

Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said Saturday that two Army soldiers and one civilian U.S. interpreter were killed, and three were wounded during the attack.

The service members had been conducting a key leader engagement with local partners in support of ongoing counter-ISIS operations when the attacker opened fire.

A Pentagon official told Fox News Digital the attack occurred in an area outside the control of interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, and that initial assessments indicate it was likely carried out by ISIS.

Syria's Ministry of Interior said Sunday its forces carried out a security operation in Palmyra, coordinated with the General Intelligence Agency and international coalition forces, that led to the arrests of five suspects who were taken into custody for questioning.

""The Ministry of Interior confirms that targeting state institutions will not go unanswered, and that the security apparatus possesses full readiness and high capability to strike with an iron fist against anyone who threatens the security and stability of the country, and to pursue terrorist organizations wherever they may be found,"" read a statement from the government in part.

""These are Americans not only on the ground to fight and defeat ISIS on behalf of the whole world, but I've worked with Task Force Armadillo and the folks stationed at [Al-Tanf Garrison] before,"" said Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, on ""Fox & Friends Weekend.""

""They've helped save lives of babies and mothers besieged by Assad, Iran, Russia, and ISIS. So, these were angels.""

President Donald Trump told reporters Sunday at the White House there will be ""a lot of damage done to the people that did it.""

""They got the person, the individual person. But there will be big damage done,"" he said.

Jurors have convicted Brian Walshe of murdering his wife, Ana, after she disappeared on New Year's Day in 2023.

The decision was reached Monday morning after jurors began deliberating on Friday. 

Brian's lawyers rested their case on Thursday morning without calling him to the stand. He previously pleaded guilty to lying to police officers after Ana disappeared and improperly disposing of her body, but he denied killing her. Sentencing for Walshe has been set for Wednesday.

Prosecutors said Brian killed his wife before disposing of her remains. He made a series of incriminating internet searches on Jan. 1, 2023, they said, which included ""how long for someone to be missing to inherit,"" ""best way to dispose of a body"" and ""best way to dispose of body parts after a murder.""

Larry Tipton, Brian's attorney, said during closing arguments that his client ""loved Ana Walshe, the mother of his three children.""

""There's no evidence that he deliberately premeditated the murder. There's no evidence that he ever intended to kill Ana Walshe. None whatsoever. Brian Walshe is not guilty. He's not guilty,"" he said on Friday during closing arguments.

Assistant Norfolk County DA Anne Yas, however, said that Brian murdered Ana then hid her body to hide the crime.

""Ana Walshe is dead because he murdered her and he intended her death. And Walshe was not missing,"" Yas said. ""Dying a sudden death from natural causes defies common sense. She was in great shape.""

On Tuesday, a forensic scientist testified that DNA consistent with Ana's profile was found on a hatchet and hacksaw recovered from the trash.

Saman Saleem, a DNA unit supervisor at the state police crime lab, also said that several items found at a Peabody, Massachusetts, trash collection site also had Ana's DNA on it, which included pieces of a rug, a Tyvek suit, unknown tissue and slippers.

FIRST ON FOX — Federal authorities say they disrupted a credible terrorist threat over the weekend, arresting four alleged members of a radical pro-Palestinian extremist group accused of planning coordinated New Year's Eve bombings in Los Angeles.

The FBI told Fox News Digital that the members self-identified as part of a radical offshoot of the Turtle Island Liberation Front (TILF), an extremist group motivated by pro-Palestinian, anti-law-enforcement, and anti-government ideology. 

According to the FBI, they were allegedly planning coordinated bombing attacks on New Year's Eve using improvised explosive devices, targeting five separate locations across Los Angeles.

The agency said the four were arrested in Lucerne Valley, where they were believed to be preparing to test explosive devices ahead of the planned attacks. They have each been charged with conspiracy and possession of a destructive device.

The FBI said Monday that a fifth individual believed to be connected to the same TILF extremist group was arrested in New Orleans for allegedly planning a separate attack.

A TILF Instagram account said its founding chapter is in Los Angeles, and its goal is to free ""Turtle Island,"" an Indigenous name used to refer to North America, from the ""illegal American empire."" 

""Free Palestine. Free Hawaii. Free Puerto Rico,"" the account posted. ""Freeing the world from American imperialism is the only way to a safe and peaceful future,"" it continued.

Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on X that the Department of Justice worked with the FBI to prevent the alleged terror plot in the Central District of California.

She said TILF was also planning to target United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and vehicles.

West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey shares what is 'powerful and moving' after visiting the National Guardsman wounded in a shooting in Washington on 'The Story.'

Former top Biden administration decision makers were silent on whether they stand by the vetting procedures deployed for ""Operation Allies Welcome,"" the Afghan resettlement program that was utilized by the alleged National Guard attacker to get to the U.S.

The heinous incident that claimed the life of one West Virginia National Guard member and gravely wounded another on Thanksgiving Eve sprung back to the forefront last week when House Homeland Security Committee ranking member Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., infuriated Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem when he referred to it as an ""unfortunate accident.""

The attack renewed questions over whether Democrats still stand by the vetting processes put in place by the previous administration — and whether officials involved in the Afghanistan withdrawal and refugee resettlement would revise those decisions today.

Fox News Digital has reached out to several members of the Biden administration with roles directly or tangentially related to the Afghanistan withdrawal and the resettlement of Afghan refugees.

SENATOR RENEWS PUSH TO MANDATE VETTING FOR AFGHAN EVACUEES AFTER NATIONAL GUARD SHOOTING

Inquiries to former President Joe Biden's office, former Vice President Kamala Harris and a second request to an individual listed as Harris' literary agent were not returned within a week.

Messages sent to former Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley [Ret.], as well as via an official at the Princeton University School of Public and International Affairs – where he is listed as a visiting professor – also went unanswered.

Milley, though a general, was not in a command position – as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is an advisory role.

In that regard, he did not make any operational decisions, but instead was in the president's ear when it came to military advice. Milley later told senators on Capitol Hill that he recommended maintaining a small, 2,500-troop force in Afghanistan.

Fox News Digital also reached out to former Central Command (CENTCOM) commander, Gen. Kenneth ""Frank"" McKenzie via his new role at the University of South Florida, for comment – which was not returned. 

AFGHAN EVACUEE ARRESTED BEFORE DC SHOOTING FEDERALLY CHARGED WITH THREATENING TERROR ATTACK

CENTCOM covers the Middle East and was tasked with overseeing security and evacuation operations out of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul.

Messages sent to addresses listed for National Security Adviser Jacob Sullivan and Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer were not returned. Finer is now a visiting fellow at Columbia University's School of Public and International Affairs, and Sullivan's wife – Rep. Maggie Goodlander, D-N.H., is in her first term in Congress.

Sullivan was a key adviser to Biden during the withdrawal and was later pressed by CNN whether he feels ""personally responsible for the failures"" therein.

He replied that the ""strategic call President Biden made, looking back three years, history has judged well and will continue to judge well. From the point of view that, if we were still in Afghanistan today, Americans would be fighting and dying; Russia would have more leverage over us; we would be less able to respond to the major strategic challenges we face.""

A woman who answered a line listed for former Secretary of State Antony Blinken redirected Fox News Digital to a press liaison. That request was not returned.

Blinken, as leader of the State Department, was the point person for the diplomatic aspect of the withdrawal. He advised Biden on what to do about the Taliban's ""Doha Agreement"" that was forged by the previous Trump administration, while the department coordinated overflight rights, temporary housing and other issues regarding the refugee outflow from Kabul.

A woman who answered an extension listed for former Pentagon chief Gen. Lloyd Austin III [Ret.] said she would take a message and that Austin would return the call if he wished.

As Pentagon chief, Austin was the top bureaucrat in the U.S. military structure at the time of the withdrawal.

After the Thanksgiving Eve attack, U.S. Citizenship for Immigration Services administrator Joe Edlow announced a review of the green card system, citing suspect Rahmanullah Lakanwal's situation.

His predecessor, Biden-appointed Ur Jaddou, did not respond to a request for comment.

Tracey Jacobson, now the chargé d'affaires for the U.S. in Dhaka, Bangladesh, led the administration's Afghanistan coordination task force charged with processing and relocating Afghan allies. She did not respond to an inquiry.

During the Afghan withdrawal, Jacobson was named by the Biden administration to lead an Afghanistan coordination task force as part of its ""whole-of-government effort to process, transport and relocate Afghan Special Immigrant Visa applicants and other Afghan allies,"" according to Biden.

Former U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Chris Magnus was asked by DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to resign in 2022 or risk being the first Biden administration official fired, according to The New York Times.

DHS officials ultimately cut his access to the agency's social media accounts, according to the paper, and a report from Heritage Foundation fellow Simon Hankinson cited that he ultimately left the job soon after.

His role would have also placed him in the midst of the orchestration of Operation Allies Welcome and Operation Allies Refuge. He was also unable to be reached for comment.

Another Mayorkas deputy, then-FEMA Director Robert Fenton Jr., was reportedly tasked with setting up Operation Allies Welcome centers to help evacuees ""integrate successfully and safely into new communities.""

Fenton remains the Region 9 administrator for the agency, tasked with an area covering the west coast and South Pacific protectorates. An inquiry to Fenton was not returned.

Mayorkas himself could not be reached directly for comment. Efforts to reach him via a law firm he was or is connected to, as well as the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he is a visiting scholar, were either unsuccessful or not returned.

FIRST ON FOX: A Senate Republican wants to nix the tax-exempt status of a national Muslim advocacy group that both Texas and Florida have designated as a terrorist organization.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, intends to introduce legislation that would remove the Council on American-Islamic Relations' (CAIR) tax-exempt status. Currently, an organization's tax-exempt status is suspended if it is designated by the State Department as a terrorist organization.

Cornyn's bill would lump CAIR in with designated federal terrorist organizations, like Hamas, Hezbollah and al Qaeda, by extending that prohibition to include groups that provide material support or resources, such as finances, services or training to a terrorist organization.

The Texas Republican said in a statement to Fox News Digital he was moving ahead with the legislation, ""because no organization who bankrolls terrorists should get a tax break, period.""

""CAIR is a radical group of terrorist sympathizers with a long history of undermining American values and trying to unconstitutionally impose Sharia law on Texas, which is why I stand behind Gov. Abbott's decision to designate it as a foreign terrorist organization,"" he said. ""I also call on President Trump to do so at the federal level to ensure this breeding ground for anti-American hate is starved of funding and forced to close its doors once and for all.""

Cornyn's bid to revoke the organization's tax-exempt status comes after both the governors of Texas and Florida designated CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood as foreign terrorist and transnational criminal organizations earlier this year. CAIR has long argued that it is not connected to the Muslim Brotherhood, which is affiliated with offshoot federally designated terrorist organizations, like Hamas.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott took executive action last month to prevent the organizations from ""acquiring any real property interest in Texas.""

His proclamation charged that ""CAIR and its members have repeatedly employed, affiliated with, and supported individuals promoting terrorism-related activities,"" and that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) considered the organization a ""front group"" for Hamas.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis similarly ordered that all Florida agencies ""undertake all lawful measures to prevent unlawful activities by these organizations, including denying privileges or resources to anyone providing material support.""

However, President Donald Trump, in an executive order late last month, ordered that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent determine which chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood, specifically in Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan, be designated as FTOs and Specially Designated Global Terrorists.

Fox News Digital did not immediately hear back from CAIR for comment on Cornyn's legislation.

Australia has agreed to new gun restrictions after a mass shooting targeting a Hanukkah celebration killed at least 15 people at Sydney's Bondi Beach on Sunday.

The new laws would tighten access to firearms in the nation in a way not seen since the 1996 Tasmania shooting, which left 35 people dead.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has proposed new firearm restrictions governing how many guns an owner can obtain, as well as reviewing existing license-holders regularly.

“The government is prepared to take whatever action is necessary,” Albanese said. “Included in that is the need for tougher gun laws. People's circumstances can change. People can be radicalized over a period of time. Licenses should not be in perpetuity.”

The 1996 shooting, named the “Port Arthur Massacre,” resulted in landmark gun control measures called the National Firearms Agreement. The agreement restricted ownership of rapid-fire weapons and initiated a buyback program.

Gun deaths in the country dropped following the legislation, which still kept it legal for certain people to own firearms. But the laws that remain are stricter than those in the United States.

Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales, said his state's laws could change without elaborating. Sydney, where Bondi Beach is located, is the state capital of New South Wales.

“It means introducing a bill to Parliament to — I mean to be really blunt — make it more difficult to get these horrifying weapons that have no practical use in our community,” Minns said.

“If you're not a farmer, you're not involved in agriculture, why do you need these massive weapons that put the public in danger and make life dangerous and difficult for New South Wales Police?” Minns asked.

Australian leaders have also proposed “additional use of criminal intelligence” to decide who is eligible for a gun license.

A father-son duo took part in the shooting, which also injured at least 38 people. The 50-year-old father, who died at the scene, had a gun license and legally owned six firearms. His 24-year-old son did not have a license and remains in a coma.

Albanese said the son had been investigated by the country's main spy agency, the Australian Security Intelligence Agency, for six months in 2019. He had been reportedly investigated for ties to a Sydney-based Islamic State group cell. Albanese said no red flags pointing to violence surrounding the 24-year-old had been found.

“He was examined on the basis of being associated with others and the assessment was made that there was no indication of any ongoing threat or threat of him engaging in violence,” Albanese said.

A bystander, Ahmed al Ahmed, wrestled one of the gunmen down and took his firearm. He has been praised for saving lives but is recovering in a hospital from gunshot wounds sustained during the attack. Minns deemed him a “real-life hero.”

BYSTANDER WHO DISARMED GUNMAN DURING BONDI BEACH SHOOTING HAILED AS HERO

“Last night, his incredible bravery no doubt saved countless lives when he disarmed a terrorist at enormous personal risk,” Minns wrote. “There is no doubt that more lives would have been lost if not for [Ahmed's] selfless courage.”

The Bondi Beach shooting is Australia's deadliest mass shooting since the 1996 attack. ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Film director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead in their California home this weekend, sparking many questions.

Nick Reiner, the couple's 32-year-old son, was arrested on Sunday and is being held on a felony charge with a $4 million bail, according to Los Angeles Police Department jail records reviewed by the Washington Examiner.

The couple's son had spoken to the media in the past about his struggles with drug addiction, which he said made him drift from his home. He has also said he spent stretches of his life homeless.

The entertainment industry was stunned, as the Reiners' Brentwood home is in a wealthy area where many celebrities live. It's also the same area where O.J. Simpson was charged with murdering Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman.

Here's what we know about the incident so far.

Police found two bodies at the Reiners' home around 3:40 p.m. on Sunday after responding to a death investigation. The LAPD called the couple's death an “apparent homicide.”

Authorities blocked off the street with yellow tape as police cars and news vans crowded around the Reiners' home.

Deputy LAPD Chief Alan Hamilton said authorities were trying to obtain a search warrant for the home. The victims were not initially identified, but Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass confirmed the couple's deaths. Reiner was 78, and Singer Reiner was 68.

“This is a devastating loss for our city and our country,” Bass wrote on X. “Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice.”

A family member found the couple with their throats cut, TMZ reported, and told police a different family member murdered them.

“It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner,” the family said in a statement. “We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.”

Hamilton said the LAPD will speak to each family member to gather more information on what transpired.

Several major Democrats also mourned Reiner, a large donor to liberal causes.

Former President Barack Obama, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), and former Vice President Kamala Harris expressed their sorrow on social media.

Reiner donated to Democrats as recently as last year, according to Federal Election Commission records reviewed by the Washington Examiner. He backed Harris in the 2024 presidential election and contributed more than $12,000 to her campaign. His largest donations came in 2020, when he backed former President Joe Biden with more than $100,000 in donations.

He also supported Obama in 2012 with a $40,000 donation.

“Michelle and I are heartbroken by the tragic passing of Rob Reiner and his beloved wife, Michele,” Obama wrote on X.

“Rob's achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen,” he added. “But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people—and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action.”

Newsom and his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, said they are “heartbroken by the tragic loss of Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner,” with the governor adding, “Rob will be remembered for his remarkable filmography and for his extraordinary contribution to humanity.”

Harris, a possible 2028 presidential candidate, said Reiner “has impacted generations of Americans.”

“The characters, dialogue, and visuals he brought to life in film and television are woven throughout our culture,” she wrote on X. “Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America's democracy.”

Reiner directed entertainment hits in the 1980s and 1990s, such as Stand by Me, This Is Spinal Tap, A Few Good Men, When Harry Met Sally, and The Princess Bride.

He earned nominations at the Golden Globe Awards for three of those movies, as well as one for 1995's The American President. Reiner never won a Golden Globe but was widely acclaimed as a star director.

The Los Angeles Times described his work as having an “astonishing versatility,” as he directed everything from an intense courtroom drama to a romantic comedy.

Reiner also worked as an actor, making his mark as Mike “Meathead” Stivic on CBS's All in the Family, which ran from 1971 to 1979. He earned two Emmys for his performance as Stivic.

Among his most notable recent acting roles was a supporting part in 2013's The Wolf of Wall Street, directed by Martin Scorsese.

ROB REINER AND WIFE FOUND DEAD INSIDE LOS ANGELES HOME

He met his wife while directing When Harry Met Sally, and the couple married in 1989. Reiner said meeting his wife inspired him to change the ending of the movie so that the main characters end up together. They had three children.

Singer Reiner worked as a photographer, producer, and actress on some of her husband's projects and was nominated for an Emmy for his 2024 documentary, Albert Brooks: Defending My Life.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump said on Truth Social that film director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michelle Singer Reiner, died because of “Trump Derangement Syndrome.”

The couple was found dead on Sunday in what police are calling an “apparent homicide.” Nick Reiner, the couple's 32-year-old son, was arrested on Sunday and is being held on a felony charge with a $4 million bail, according to LAPD jail records reviewed by the Washington Examiner. He had spoken to the media in the past about his struggles with drug addiction and said it made him drift from his home. He has also told interviewers that he spent stretches of his life homeless.

“A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday morning. “Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.”

Trump often says his opponents are afflicted with “Trump Derangement Syndrome,” an ailment once defined by Urban Dictionary as a “mental condition in which a person has been driven effectively insane due to their dislike of Donald Trump, to the point at which they will abandon all logic and reason.”

“He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession with President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before,” Trump concluded. “May Rob and Michele rest in peace!”

Reiner, a prominent Democratic donor, expressed fierce opposition to Trump online and deleted his X account following the 2024 election. He told the Daily Beast in September that Trump “doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.”

Reiner also compared Trump to a “zombie or a cockroach” during his 2024 presidential election campaign.

Trump's Truth Social post triggered negative reactions from across the political spectrum.

“Remember when people were cancelled for not expressing the proper Official Emotions of Grief for Charlie Kirk? Yeah, me too. In related news, Trump's grave will reek of ammonia for all eternity,” Lincoln Project co-founder Rick Wilson wrote on X.

Reps. Marjorie Taylor-Greene (R-GA) and Thomas Massie (R-KY) called the president out for his social media post, suggesting it was in poor taste.

MAJOR DEMOCRATIC DONOR ROB REINER AND WIFE FOUND DEAD IN HOME: WHAT WE KNOW

“Rob Reiner and his wife were tragically killed at the hands of their own son, who reportedly had drug addiction and other issues, and their remaining children are left in serious mourning and heartbreak. This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies,” Greene wrote on X, adding that the situation “should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.”

Massie had stronger words for the president: “Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered. I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the [vice president], and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The United States and Australia suffered horrific mass shootings over the weekend. First, a gunman at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, opened fire in a classroom building during final exams, killing two students and wounding nine others, several critically. And on Sunday morning at Bondi Beach in Sydney, a pair of Islamic terrorists sprayed bullets into a public Hanukkah celebration, killing at least 15.

Unsurprisingly, prominent Democrats have labeled the attacks as instances of “gun violence,” emphasizing the role of guns and downplaying the motives and identities of the shooters. 

Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) referenced both tragedies in an X post Sunday afternoon while decrying the “epidemic of gun violence” and marking the Sandy Hook anniversary. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) also invoked Sandy Hook in response to the Brown shooting, lamenting that “we've done far too little to stop these recurring attacks.”

These despicable and intellectually bankrupt comments are low even by the standards of Hochul and Booker. To ascribe fundamental blame to guns or gun laws in either case is deeply disconnected from reality — and cynically manipulative.

We know for certain that Islamist antisemitism inspired the Bondi Beach attack. Australian police declared the shooting a terrorist incident linked to antisemitism. The two shooters involved, a father and son of Muslim background, specifically targeted Jews celebrating a holy day. Reducing this atrocity to generic “gun violence,” as if it were indistinguishable from a teenager accessing the family rifle, whitewashes the anti-Jewish hatred at root and absolves Islamism of responsibility. Progressives dare not name the ideology for fear of offending their woke base, so they redirect attention to guns.

This framing is especially absurd given that both Australia and Rhode Island have some of the world's toughest gun laws on the books. 

Following a mass shooting in 1996, Australia enacted sweeping reforms, featuring a mandatory government buy-back and a total ban on automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns. In Australia, gun ownership is viewed as a privilege, not a right.

For its part, Rhode Island consistently ranks among the top states for strict firearm regulations according to gun-control advocacy groups, with universal background checks, red-flag laws, an assault-weapons ban, and high-capacity magazine limits. Brown University, meanwhile, is a “gun-free zone,” meaning that good guys with guns are unable to intervene in such instances. 

Whether the shooter obtained his gun from out-of-state, as initial reports indicate, or he bought it in Rhode Island makes little tangible difference. The U.S. famously has more guns in circulation than people, including tens of millions of untraceable firearms on the black market. There is no way to “ban guns,” as progressives like to pretend, or to enact a government buyback program that wouldn't disarm law-abiding citizens while leaving armed criminals with nonregistered guns. 

TWO DEAD, NINE INJURED IN MASS SHOOTING AT BROWN UNIVERSITY

It's understandable to want to “do something” in response to these atrocities. But enacting stricter gun laws wouldn't achieve much in the way of preventing future ones. It's wishful thinking at best and deliberate evasion at worst.

Democrats are quick to point to the “gun violence epidemic” following mass shootings because dealing with the true fundamental cause is politically inconvenient. Confronting the evil of Islamism and the sickness of our culture, which keeps churning out homicidal maniacs bent on mass murder, would force them to challenge their own assumptions. And we know that's not something they're willing to do. ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) claimed that officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement pulled over her son on Saturday and requested identification, though they left without incident.

“Yesterday, after he made a stop at Target, he did get pulled over by [ICE] agents, and once he was able to produce his passport ID, they did let him go,” Omar told a Minnesota-area radio station.

Omar, who is Somali American, also said that a week before the traffic stop, ICE officers were at a mosque where her son was praying but left without incident. Omar added that her son “always” carries his passport just in case he is stopped by federal immigration officers.

News of the traffic stop comes as immigration enforcement has been ramped up in Minnesota as part of  what the Department of Homeland Security has dubbed “Operation Metro Surge.”

ICE officers have insisted they are not “targeting” Somalis in the operation, with DHS recently touting arrests of more than 400 illegal immigrants from various countries.

But Trump has escalated his rhetoric against the Somali community, which has been under scrutiny over a massive financial fraud scandal that is being investigated by the Treasury Department.

That has included him directly calling out Omar, including at a speech in Pennsylvania on Tuesday on affordability.

“I love this Ilhan Omar,” Trump said. “Whatever the hell her name is, with the little turban. I love her. She comes in, does nothing but bitch. She's always complaining.”

The person of interest detained in connection with the mass shooting at Brown University will be released, Providence, Rhode Island, Mayor Brett Smiley announced.

Federal law enforcement officers had initially detained a 24-year-old man from Wisconsin after a manhunt for a suspect in the shooting that killed two people and injured nine others. But officials stressed that evidence “now points in a different direction.”

It marks a sharp turn in an investigation that now leaves officials with little to go on. Gov. Dan McKee (D-RI) expressed uncertainty about where it was headed, while Smiley said officials do not know if the gunman left the state.

Smiley did say authorities are looking for “additional video evidence” after a short clip of the suspected shooter did not reveal his face.

He also maintained that there is no need for a reimposition of the shelter-in-place order.

“The status of safety in our community remains unchanged, and we believe that you remain safe in our community,” Smiley said.

The manhunt will now resume and stretch into this week after the shooting occurred on Saturday.

The shooting unfolded at around 4 p.m. that day, with a lone gunman entering a classroom in a campus building and opening fire, killing two and injuring nine. Students at the Ivy League School were just starting final exams this weekend, which have since been canceled.

The problem with fixating on inequality, oligarchy, and other abstractions

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

One of the great mysteries about the rise of populism, in both the United States and Europe, is why it has benefited the political right so much more than the left. For years, American progressives have been trying to get people worked up over rising rates of economic inequality, with the expectation that this anger could fuel greater support for the Democratic Party. Yet the electoral fruits of this effort have been pretty much nonexistent. The recently concluded “Fighting Oligarchy” tour by the democratic-socialist luminaries Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez barely registered in public opinion.

Progressives might well be wondering: How could Americans be so upset about their economic situation and yet fail to make the obvious connection to the actual causes of their distress? How could they get so angry at immigrants and not at billionaires? In the past, left-wing populists, and populist left-wing movements, have scored political successes. Why do their counterparts today have so much difficulty getting anything going?

The problem stems from a failure to grasp the psychology underlying populism. Broadly speaking, populism today is a revolt against cognitive elites, not economic elites. Its centerpiece is the affirmation of common sense over the fancy theories favored by intellectuals. By invoking inequality and oligarchy, would-be populists on the left are complaining about abstractions—an approach more likely to alienate than engage the average voter.

Populism is popular because it speaks to voters in concrete terms and tells them that their first instincts—about economics and more—are correct. This year, at least one person solved the puzzle of creating a successful left-wing populist message: New York Mayor–Elect Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who rose from 1 percent in early primary polls to more than 50 percent of the general-election vote, explicitly promised to make groceries cheaper and freeze rents. Many Democrats would love to know how to bottle the Mamdani lightning.

Idrees Kahloon: Political parties have disconnected from the public

As Stephen Colbert explained long ago, common sense comes from thinking “from the gut, not the brain.” Psychologists have a more sophisticated way of articulating this distinction. As readers of Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow or Malcolm Gladwell's Blink know, the human mind exhibits two different systems of cognition. The first is rapid and concrete, focusing on primary representations of things you can see, hear, and touch. The second is slower and more laborious, but capable of abstraction and logical reasoning. In some cases, the two systems produce different verdicts. This can create persistent disagreement between common sense and expert opinion.

The distinctive feature of a populist message is a reliance on rapid cognition. Populist politicians focus on primary representations of the world, such as the price of groceries, rather than abstract concepts, such as affordability. Everyone can picture the price of orange juice or bread on the supermarket shelf. During his presidential campaign last year, President Donald Trump spent a great deal of time summoning such mental images. “Groceries, such a simple word,” he has repeatedly said by way of explaining his victory. Many liberals made fun of his rhetoric.

Mamdani was apparently one of the few to draw the obvious conclusion from Trump's remarks, which was that instead of mocking him, perhaps the left should also be talking about groceries. So one of the major promises Mamdani made was to lower the price of groceries in New York by creating publicly owned, city-run grocery stores. Experts objected that grocery stores typically operate on slim margins and that the major costs occur further up the supply chain. Like most educated people, Mamdani probably knows this. The problem is that a supply chain is an entirely abstract concept, and so might as well not exist for the average person. Nobody gets worked up about a supply chain.

Obviously, a plausible plan for lowering the price of food would require dealing with issues such as agricultural subsidies, transportation costs, and retail overhead, but a political candidate is not going to get the average person excited by talking this way. People who are angry about the cost of living are going to focus on the last link in the chain, the consumer-facing organization, and that means the grocery store.

Mamdani's grocery-store proposal has a clear parallel with the anger frequently directed toward health-insurance companies. Last December, the targeted shooting of a UnitedHealthcare executive on a Manhattan street ignited a populist brushfire, leading to widespread veneration of Luigi Mangione, the man accused of the killing. In that case too, wonks tried to correct the record, pointing out that health-insurance companies also have relatively slim profit margins, and are not really responsible for much of the excess cost of the U.S. health-care system. This analysis, however, relies on a series of abstract concepts that have no intuitive appeal. For people who are angry—which presumably includes the one-third of American households carrying medical debt—health-insurance companies naturally get the blame.

Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, and their allies don't just decry oligarchy and inequality in the abstract, of course. They also pin blame on billionaires—who one might assume would make obvious targets for public outrage. Yet the problem with complaining about Jeff Bezos's yacht or tax cuts for Elon Musk is that these people are completely outside the reference class of all but a small handful of Americans. To the extent that people are bothered by what others have, their attitudes are based on comparison with a specific reference group. They pick out someone with roughly the same background as themselves, then judge their own level of success and material comfort by how well their situation compares. This is why high-school reunions are fraught. The ultra-wealthy, meanwhile, might as well be living on another planet, as far as social comparisons are concerned. Rather than feeling anger and resentment toward them, many Americans simply admire their success. The long-running television show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous was not communist agitation; it was a celebration of American capitalism.

Ultimately, demonizing billionaires only achieves so much. Perhaps that's why Mamdani's proposal to increase taxes on the wealthy was accompanied by more concrete promises, such as making bus rides free and lowering prices at halal carts. Skeptics have downplayed the national relevance of his campaign, on the grounds that New York is famously soft on socialism, but the real lesson has less to do with Mamdani's ideology than with his specificity.

To do populism effectively, politicians must not only focus on problems that the public cares about; by and large, they must also accept the public's framing of those problems. This creates a dilemma for the left, because that framing, in a complex modern society, will usually be incorrect. As a result, left-wing politicians struggle to find issues on which they can be authentically populist. Many of the problems that they hope to resolve, such as climate change, housing scarcity, and surging health-care costs, are complicated. This means that the policies needed to fix them are also complicated, and cannot be explained without ascending to the realm of abstraction. Slogans that resonate with the public seldom translate literally into successful policy.

There have, of course, been genuine left-wing populists, but they have a poor record of achieving progressive policy objectives. Consider the case of Hugo Chávez, who ruled Venezuela from 1999 until his death in 2013. Chávez was an authentic populist, in the sense that he really did reject the fancy theories of intellectuals. His response to inflation in the Venezuelan economy, and particularly to rising food prices, was to impose a set of price controls on basic commodities. In the process, he crushed entire sectors of the economy—for instance, by making it impossible to sell some foods at anything other than a loss. People reacted by withdrawing their goods from the market. After Chávez died, his successor continued his policies. Millions of Venezuelans were pushed into hunger, and the economy collapsed almost entirely—one of the largest self-inflicted economic catastrophes of the modern era.

The problem is not that Chávez was a socialist but that he was a populist. If one restricts oneself to primary representations of the world, what inflation looks like is a general increase in the price of goods. Appearances, however, are misleading. Inflation is actually just a decline in the value of money. Politicians who are willing to follow their head rather than their gut on this question can usually be convinced that halting the decline requires tighter monetary policy. This is the exact opposite of the populist response. What Chávez did was what anyone reasoning in a concrete manner would be inclined to do: He ordered the people who had been raising prices to stop doing it. And when he didn't like how they responded, he sent the National Guard out to seize their goods.

One can see here the problem with the populism-envy that has consumed the left in recent years. Thinking up effective populist slogans that condemn various aspects of the modern world is not so difficult. The problem is figuring out what to do if you win. Because the slogans generally don't correspond to actionable policies, making life better for people requires some sort of bait and switch.

Mamdani is obviously a talented campaigner, and even seems to be a successful Trump-whisperer. He's also shown some ideological flexibility: Having already jettisoned his past rhetoric about defunding the police, he now plans to keep in place the city's police commissioner, Jessica Tisch. And yet his biggest challenge now is figuring out how to break the populist promises that got him elected, so he can focus on implementing the technocratic policies that are actually needed to improve his constituents' life.

The fundamental nature of living things challenges assumptions that physicists have held for centuries.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

On October 8, 2024, the field of physics was plunged into controversy. That day, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for discoveries not involving black holes, cosmology, or strange new subatomic particles, but about AI. How could the discipline's highest award go to research about machines designed to mimic human brains? Where was the physics in that?

For most of the 20th century, physicists largely ignored living systems. They understood living things as machines, albeit ones made of gooey parts. A subfield called biophysics uncovered specific physical mechanisms behind those molecular machines. Organisms as a whole, however, were not a major concern.

But today, many of my colleagues in physics no longer agree with such dismissals. Instead, we have come to believe that a mystery is unfolding in every microbe, animal, and human—one that challenges basic assumptions physicists have held for centuries, and could answer essential questions about AI. It may even help redefine the field for the next generation.

The central hubris of physics has long been the idea that it is the most “fundamental” of all sciences. Physics students learn about the basic stuff of reality—space and time, energy and matter—and are told that all other scientific disciplines must reduce back down to the fundamental particles and laws that physics has generated. This philosophy, called “reductionism,” worked pretty well from Newton's laws through much of the 20th century as physicists discovered electrons, quarks, the theory of relativity, and so on. But over the past few decades, progress in the most reductionist branches of physics has slowed. For example, long-promised “theories of everything,” such as string theory, have not borne significant fruit.

There are, however, ways other than reductionism to think about what's fundamental in the universe. Beginning in the 1980s, physicists (along with researchers in other fields) began developing new mathematical tools to study what's called “complexity”—systems in which the whole is far more than the sum of its parts. The end goal of reductionism was to explain everything in the universe as the result of particles and their interactions. Complexity, by contrast, recognizes that once lots of particles come together to produce macroscopic things—such as organisms—knowing everything about particles isn't enough to understand reality. An early pioneer of this approach was the physicist Philip W. Anderson, who succinctly framed the nascent anti-reductionist perspective with the phrase “More is different.” Complex-systems science has grown rapidly in the 21st century, and researchers in the field won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2021.

From a physicist's perspective, no complex system is weirder or more challenging than life. For one thing, the organization of living matter defies physicists' usual expectations about the universe. Your body is made of matter, just like everything else. But the atoms you're built from today won't be the atoms you're built from in a year. That means you and every other living thing aren't an inert object, like a rock, but a dynamic pattern playing out over time. The real challenge for physics, however, is that the patterns that make up life are self-organized. Living systems both create and maintain themselves in a strange kind of loop that no existing machine can replicate. Think about the cell membrane, which enables a cell to stay alive by letting some chemicals in while keeping others out. The cell creates and continually maintains the membrane, but the membrane is also itself a process that makes the cell.

That chicken-and-egg problem challenges the dream of the old physics: that once the universe's fundamental particles were cataloged, everything else could be explicitly described and predicted. Give me a young star, and I can use the reductionist laws of physics to predict that star's future: It will live a million years rather than a billion years; it will die as a black hole rather than as a white dwarf. But the components of a living organism yield something new and unexpected, a phenomenon called “emergence.” Give me a simple cell from the early days of Earth's history, and I could never predict that some 4 billion years later it would evolve into a giant rabbit that can punch you in the face. Kangaroos—like humans—are an unpredictable, emergent consequence of life's evolution.

The fundamental laws that govern matter and energy cannot predict another fundamental property of life: It is the only system in the universe that uses information for its own purposes. Plants grow toward light, microbes swim toward rich food sources, animals hide from predators, humans send giant metal contraptions into outer space. Although one can, say, program a robot to search for a wall plug when its battery gets low, a living thing (a human programmer, for example) must hard-code that need into the machine. Life, by contrast, is both agential and autonomous. From microbes to crabs to people, all living things have their own itches to scratch.

To truly understand living systems as self-organized, autonomous agents, physicists need to abandon their “just the particles, ma'am” mentality. One of physicists' great talents—starting with the laws of simple parts (such as atoms) and working up to a complex whole—cannot fully account for cells, animals, or people. Luckily, the field has another elemental skill that can help: a particular way of asking questions and building models to make predictions. Physicists have always been good at capturing the essential aspects of a system and casting those essentials in the language of mathematics. How much useful energy flows through a cell membrane? Which arrangement of neurons maximizes the information in a flatworm's nervous system? Now those skills must be brought to bear on an age-old question that is only just getting its proper due: What is life?

Using these skills, physicists—working together with representatives of all the other disciplines that make up complexity science—may crack open the question of how life formed on Earth billions of years ago and how it might have formed on the distant alien worlds we can now explore with cutting-edge telescopes. Just as important, understanding why life, as an organized system, is different at a fundamental level from all the other stuff in the universe may help astronomers design new strategies for finding it in places bearing little resemblance to Earth. Analyzing life—no matter how alien—as a self-organizing information-driven system may provide the key to detecting biosignatures on planets hundreds of light-years away.

Closer to home, studying the nature of life is likely essential to fully understanding intelligence—and building artificial versions. Throughout the current AI boom, researchers and philosophers have debated whether and when large language models might achieve general intelligence or even become conscious—or whether, in fact, some already have. The only way to properly assess such claims is to study, by any means possible, the sole agreed-upon source of general intelligence: life. Bringing the new physics of life to problems of AI may not only help researchers predict what software engineers can build; it may also reveal the limits of trying to capture life's essential character in silicon.

As the 21st century continues to unfold, my fellow physicists will undoubtedly continue to advance the study of black holes, quantum mechanics, and other traditional domains. The study of life, however, will take us to places we've never imagined, opening a path for the future of our field that, for once, unfolds on a level playing field with biologists, ecologists, neuroscientists, and sociologists. At its best, the pursuit of fundamental answers about the nature of living things might lead physicists not only to new scientific marvels, but also to an entirely new way of doing science.

The president's pardons encourage public officials to place personal interests ahead of the interests of the people.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

When Donald Trump pardoned U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar earlier this month, he added to a spate of clemencies that has directly attacked a founding principle of America's democratic republic: the expectation that elected representatives will serve as fiduciaries of the public trust. Cuellar became the 11th elected American official to receive clemency from President Trump this year. Other presidents have shied away from using the pardon power to protect public officials. Joe Biden issued individual pardons to just two state-level elected officials, but not for crimes that occurred while they held public office. Neither Barack Obama nor George W. Bush pardoned any elected officials during their respective eight years in office.

Trump, by contrast, has pardoned both well-known figures such as Cuellar, accused of taking $600,000 in bribes from foreign companies; Representative George Santos of New York, who defrauded his constituents in virtually every conceivable way; and Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, who tried to sell a U.S. Senate seat; and lesser characters, such as a state official in Nevada who stole money from a police memorial fund, an elected sheriff in Virginia who sold badges for cash, and a former Tennessee state legislator who defrauded taxpayers to win contracts for his business. Cuellar's pardon came just days after Trump's unprecedented pardon of a foreign head of state—former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez—who was convicted of corrupting his own government from the top down by operating it as a narco-state. Trump pardoned at least 10 public officials in his first term in office.

Since Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon, which prompted swift public backlash, pardons for official corruption have been rare, until now. The Justice Department—whose Office of the Pardon Attorney advises the president on pardons—has long considered crimes involving a breach of the public trust to be among the most serious offenses on the books. That office, which I led from 2022 until March of this year, has rarely if ever recommended pardons for such betrayals. In effect, Trump's pardons are licensing elected officials, at all levels of government, to profit off the powers entrusted to them by the American people.

Trump's agenda transcends partisan politics. In addition to Cuellar and Blagojevich (who recently visited the Justice Department), Trump has pardoned a third Democratic politician this year: Alexander Sittenfeld, a Cincinnati city councilman convicted of bribery and attempted extortion. Elected officials on both sides have also benefited from dismissals of prosecutions, sweetheart plea deals, and the dismantling of the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section, a specialized unit created to target public corruption. Trump's goal is much more ambitious than boosting his political allies—he is aiming to fundamentally reshape the American system of governance to make room for graft. Such self-enrichment is antithetical to a government that is supposed to serve the people.

Trump, though, has moved swiftly to implement a different vision for American government. He is engineering a return to a patronage system, in which pardons feature prominently. The Justice Department used to rely on merit-based guidelines, rooted in considerations of remorse, rehabilitation, and redemption. Trump has abandoned those, favoring instead a transactional approach. Pardon seekers once applied for relief through the Office of the Pardon Attorney, a process that can be lengthy and cumbersome due to rigorous vetting requirements. Today, wealthy and powerful pardon hopefuls are funneling their requests straight to the president's desk by way of well-connected intermediaries. Untold sums are changing hands along the way, in the form of lobbying fees, legal services, donations, and investments.

Trump has discovered that pardons can serve as an inexhaustible supply of currency that he can print with his own hand and dispense as easily as signing a check. He is using the currency of pardons to amass power, wielding their possibility as a tool to command political loyalty. This was obvious in the case of Cuellar, who lavished Trump with praise and gratitude after the announcement.

Pardons have also been a lucrative source of personal wealth for this president. The desire to obtain a pardon looks to have induced a foreign billionaire to broker a multibillion-dollar investment using the Trump-family cryptocurrency company. The same ambition appears to have driven a well-heeled Palm Beach mother to shell out $1 million for the opportunity to make her case for her son's clemency over dinner with the president at Mar-a-Lago. Others have donated handsomely to Trump's campaign.

Casey Michel: America has never seen corruption like this

Pardons are just one piece of a larger strategy to take America back to a “spoils system” of government. This phrase emerged during the presidency of Andrew Jackson—Trump's favored predecessor—when Senator William Marcy of New York, who defended Jackson's stacking of government with political loyalists, said, “To the victor belong the spoils of the enemy.” In the decades that followed, Congress ended the spoils system with a series of legislative enactments that created a nonpartisan, merit-based civil-service government. Trump is now seeking to restore the old way of doing business, including bypassing the civil-service laws—which he views as an unconstitutional constraint on his Article II powers—to replace career officials with political loyalists. (Case in point: My former post of pardon attorney historically has been reserved for a nonpolitical official; the person who now holds the post is a staunch partisan operative.) Normalizing public corruption through clemency is another flex of the president's Article II powers.

Trump's destruction of long-standing clemency norms is already having numerous corrosive effects on democracy. It undermines public trust in government. It undercuts the fair and impartial administration of justice. And it licenses public officials to place their own personal and financial interests ahead of the interests of the people they were elected to serve, just as Donald Trump is doing at the very top. To him, of course, that's not a problem; it's the goal.

The director Michael Mann isn't thought of as a romantic but the men of Heat, which turns 30 today, are fueled by their relationships.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Michael Mann's movies are appraised by many critics and audiences alike as movies for men. It's easy to understand why: His gangsters and crime fighters are gruff and self-important, dominating the screen with close-ups of their deathly serious expressions. Though his movies often feature compelling female characters, the typical Mann plot involves a man—or two, or three—hashing out some plan of action.

But these men are also compelled by love—and without the push and pull of romance, there would be no deeper story within many of his films. If many cinematic romances imagine how two people can overcome adversity through love, a Mann romance is more about how love itself can be the adversity. Were it not for their relationships, the highly skilled professionals in his movies might endlessly and easily rob every bank or catch every criminal.

No Mann film exemplifies this more than Heat, which was released 30 years ago, in 1995. By then, Mann had explored romantic tension in Thief and Manhunter, movies in which the protagonist's love life helps shape their motivations and moves the plot forward. In Heat, those relationships are the plot. On its face, the film is about the cops-and-robbers, Tom-and-Jerry dynamic between Vincent Hanna, a Los Angeles Police Department lieutenant (played by Al Pacino), and Neil McCauley, a bank-robbing mastermind (Robert De Niro). But the heart of the story is what happens with McCauley's right-hand man, Chris (Val Kilmer), and his wife, Charlene (Ashley Judd).

Mann's movies are interested in the tension that results when two individuals pit their independent lives against a near-inexplicable desire for each other. When we first meet Chris and Charlene by the pool at their Los Angeles villa, the passion in their eyes says it all. But their marriage is a mutual liability: Chris is a gambling junkie who fuels his lifestyle through dangerous heists, and Charlene is a young mother looking for stability for their son. If either had any sense, they'd call it quits.

And yet, Chris can't quit Charlene. “For me, the sun rises and sets with her, man,” he tells McCauley after sleeping off another bender. Hanna's squad has gotten onto Charlene's trail, and threatened her with imprisonment if she doesn't help them arrest Chris. Following McCauley's big bank job that serves as the movie's centerpiece, Charlene and her son are stashed at a safe house, where she's set to rendezvous with Chris before he skips town—and where the police will presumably corner him. From a balcony, Charlene watches Chris step out of his car with a new haircut and the biggest grin in the world. During the bank shootout and a resulting chase scene, he caught a bullet in his shoulder and is now visibly pale from blood loss. One look from the woman he loves, however, can make everything right.

When Charlene waves him off, indicating the plan was a trap, Chris's world collapses. In a brilliant bit of acting by Kilmer, his crumbling facial expression shows just how rudderless he is without her. For Charlene, letting Chris walk puts her at risk of prison time; their son might be sent to foster care. Still, even after all the screaming fights, the two have a bond that appears to cause physical pain when broken. This moment carries the entire movie. All the gunfights, stress, and back-alley surgery—what was it for, if it pushed you away from the love of your life?

Notably, Chris takes exactly 30 seconds after Charlene's signal to get back in his car and drive off. That's the magic number quoted by McCauley, first to Chris and later to Hanna, that gives this movie its title: “Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.” For McCauley, this mantra is about the discipline required to stay out of prison. Early in the film, we see him responding to Eady (Amy Brenneman), a woman he meets at a diner, as though she'll just needlessly tie him down. Before sleeping with her, he tells her, “I am alone. I am not lonely.” He then leaves her in the middle of the night, and heads back to his life of no attachments.

But something shifts when McCauley sees the smiles and laughter between his crew and their wives while they're all out celebrating a successful robbery. He has never wanted a regular life, but he is getting older—and time is running out. He has an idea that all of his thievery is building toward something, a way out, a new life. However, surrounded by loving couples in the restaurant, his facade breaks. One phone call to Eady, and he's back at her place, asking her to run away with him.

The romance between Eady and McCauley is complicated. Both are loners teetering on the fringes of society, and Eady's ability to see McCauley as a real person, even if only as a stranger reading a book, is enough to undo his entire worldview. On their first real night together, they tell each other their dreams while looking out at L.A.'s blinking lights from a balcony. When McCauley walks out the next morning, he leaves Eady a glass of water wrapped in a perfectly folded napkin—a rare sign of tenderness from a man who, at the start of the movie, didn't hesitate to order the execution of armored-car guards. “I'm a needle starting at zero going the other way—a double blank,” he later tells her. “Then, all of a sudden, someone like you comes along.” It's a line worthy of any romance, easily placeable in a Frank Capra or Nora Ephron film.

Rooted in these romances, Heat transcends its crime-driven plot to become a bigger rumination on life's purpose. Chris's and McCauley's relationships might be roadblocks to success as bank robbers, but the easy life they want is unimaginable without the women they love. In that way, they resemble the workaholic husband in a rom-com who is trying to get the top promotion even as it causes strife in his marriage. For these two professional crooks, however, that means squaring their desire for an everyday home life with chasing big scores and brutal murder.

This sentiment is echoed throughout Mann's oeuvre. In Manhunter, an FBI agent's love for his wife fuels his incessant need to stop a serial killer who is targeting families. In The Last of the Mohicans, an adopted member of an Indigenous tribe puts his community in danger after falling for the daughter of a British officer. Time and time again, Mann pits his characters' ambitions and responsibilities against their romantic desires, forcing them to either accept a balance or lose it all. His most recent film, Ferrari, explicitly sees the title character trying to juggle his relationships with his wife and mistress alongside his passion for car racing. “This is how life really is,” Mann said in an interview with Collider. “It's complex; it's complicated.”

Mann's romances do feel realistic, even when they're staged in larger-than-life action movies. His love stories require work, patience, and sacrifice to succeed, and even the best outcomes leave their participants a little banged up from the turbulence. The characters who invest in romance tend to make it out okay, while many of those who can't commit are left with tragedy. Romance may be difficult, but it might also be the meaning of life—a sentiment that is reflected in the real world, where the filmmaker has been married to his wife for more than 50 years. If only his characters could see it so clearly.

Anti-Jewish prejudice isn't a partisan divide—it's a generational one.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

“The more I'm around young people, the more panicked I am,” Tim Miller told me recently. A prominent anti-Trump commentator, Miller hosts the popular Bulwark Podcast and regularly speaks to students on university campuses. Lately, he has begun to notice something disturbing.

“I was literally arguing with a kid, like, three weeks ago, college kid, who was, like, you know, starting to think that the Jews killed Charlie Kirk,” Miller recounted on his show, amid a discussion about rising anti-Semitism on the American right. The student, he noted, was a “left kid.”

Miller had good reason to be alarmed, because the problem he observed extends well beyond anecdotes. In late 2024, the Democratic data scientist David Shor surveyed nearly 130,000 voters at the behest of Kamala Harris's presidential campaign. He found that a quarter of those younger than 25—with negligible differences among Trump and Harris supporters—held an “unfavorable opinion” of “Jewish people.” (Jewish people—not Israelis or Zionists.) By contrast, the older a person was, the less likely they were to express such sentiments.

One year later, an avalanche of data has confirmed what Shor glimpsed and researchers and reporters like myself have argued for years: American anti-Semitism is not primarily a partisan phenomenon, as it is often framed in popular discourse, but a generational one. Jews constitute just 2 percent of the American population, but they've assumed much larger and more sinister proportions in the imagination of the country's youth.

Last week, the Yale Youth Poll released its fall survey, which found that “younger voters are more likely to hold antisemitic views than older voters.” When asked to choose whether Jews have had a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the United States, just 8 percent of respondents said “negative.” But among 18-to-22-year-olds, that number was 18 percent. Twenty-seven percent of 18-to-22-year-olds strongly or somewhat agreed that “Jews in the United States have too much power,” compared with 16 percent overall and just 11 percent of those over 65.

Read: Why so many people still don't understand anti-Semitism

Earlier this month, the conservative Manhattan Institute published a survey of contemporary Republicans and found a similar split. One-quarter of those under 50 reported that “they themselves openly express” anti-Semitic views, six times more than those over 50, just 4 percent of whom said the same. Here, as elsewhere, age was a key indicator of whether a person would espouse anti-Jewish attitudes. In recent years, the Anti-Defamation League, the UCLA Nationscape project, and the American National Election surveys have all found the same age curve in their data on attitudes toward Jewish people.

In other words, the research collectively suggests that America is becoming more anti-Semitic because its young people are becoming more anti-Semitic. This finding flies in the face of the folk wisdom that prejudice is the province of the old and will die out with them. That maxim may be true of some bigotries, but anti-Semitism is not one of them. Instead, in the United States, the opposite is happening: Anti-Jewish prejudice is growing precisely because it is the domain of the next generation, not the previous one. As this young cohort takes its place in American society, that society becomes more anti-Semitic, because politicians, influencers, and tastemakers are trying to reflect youth sensibilities and cater to them.

Any generational shift this dramatic has more than one cause. In the 20th century, the Holocaust and World War II profoundly and positively reshaped American attitudes toward Jews, but young people today have no first- or secondhand memory of that experience. Americans who are middle-aged or older tend to get their information from legacy media outlets, which, for all their flaws, normally have editorial processes that eschew explicitly racist material. Younger Americans, by contrast, are likely to trust and get their news from lightly moderated social-media platforms, which often advantage the extreme opinions, conspiracy theories, and conflict-stoking content that drive engagement. This bifurcation of information has consequences. Figuring out who was responsible for a national calamity, for instance, takes time and investigation. Blaming that calamity on the Jews does not. The kinds of media that reach for the latter explanation are the ones that hold sway with the younger audience.

Read: People are underestimating America's groyper problem

Young people also tend to be more critical of Israel than their elders, leading a minority to excuse or even perpetrate anti-Jewish acts in America in the name of Palestine. These critics are likely to consume anti-Israel content on their social-media apps of choice. The platforms then funnel some of those users toward anti-Semitic material—a sort of algorithmic escalator that ends up radicalizing a percentage of them.

The implications of these data are undeniably depressing, but the findings actually provide grounds for pragmatic optimism as well. Survey after survey shows that anti-Semitism remains a minority prejudice even among young people, who are a minority of Americans. The Yale Youth Poll found that 43 percent of voters younger than 22 agreed with at least one statement commonly considered anti-Semitic, but that 57 percent of their same-age peers did not. Indeed, in nearly every scenario surveyed, the poll found that most young people—not just most people—rejected anti-Jewish propositions.

America may have a generational divide on anti-Semitism, but the country also has a broad consensus against it. Anti-Semitic ideologues have grown louder in the public discourse, but the upset they still evoke demonstrates that the American majority rejects the tenets of anti-Jewish ideology. This reality is just obscured by opportunistic partisans and influencers who dominate discourse and constantly shift the conversation away from the consensus views and toward the contentious ones.

Rather than falling into this trap, Americans should look for leaders—political, cultural, and religious—who cater to the consensus and seek to strengthen it, rather than empowering those who pander to extreme constituencies. Trend lines are not finish lines. The numbers are a call to action, not despair.

Poor nutrition could contribute to mental illness, but are supplements the answer?

By May 2024, Ebony Dupas knew she had a problem. She had started to feel a mild anxiety about her sense of direction and purpose in life earlier that year, but within a couple months, that had spiraled into a paranoia that she could neither shake nor explain.

Referred by her doctor, Dupas began consulting with different psychiatrists, all of whom considered diagnosing her with generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. Most wanted to put her on medication right away. But one psychiatrist first ordered bloodwork to see if something else might be going on. “I was mostly depleted of magnesium,” Dupas says.

Most people being treated for mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression typically use a mix of just two strategies: medication (usually an SSRI) and psychotherapy. But there's increasing interest in the connection between food and the brain, and especially how nutrition could affect psychiatric conditions. Researchers have not only found a connection between the gut microbiome and mental health, but also connections between deficiencies in certain micronutrients, including magnesium or choline, and conditions like anxiety and depression.

What's less clear is how supplementation could alleviate certain symptoms. We don't have robust clinical trial data showing how micronutrients affect people's mental health, and the role of supplements in mental health is understudied, particularly because the research can be so challenging. Most supplements also don't require approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to go to market, meaning there's an abundance of different options, most of which have different formulas that aren't robustly studied.

While researchers have long understood that nutrition is important for brain health, people don't typically look to their diets as a way to improve their mental health, and doctors don't always think to connect mental health with diet. The link between food and the brain “is overlooked by most people,” says Uma Naidoo, director of nutritional and lifestyle psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital and author of the 2023 book Calm Your Mind With Food. Future research to clarify the link between micronutrients — through either food or supplements — and mental health outcomes could help us stop underestimating that link.

The connection between diet and the brain seems counterintuitive, but it's actually linked to basic biology. “The same environment where food is being digested is also the environment where neurotransmitters are produced,” Naidoo says. The gut produces most of the body's serotonin, as well as a good portion of the neurotransmitter GABA. Drugs used to alter levels of serotonin are frequently used to treat depression and anxiety. The most common group are known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

One of the best understood links between nutrition and mental health involves how food affects the gut microbiome. Researchers have known for years now that gut inflammation and changes in the gut microbiome are linked to mental conditions like anxiety and depression, and possibly other psychiatric disorders. But there's also a growing and ongoing interest in how specific vitamins and minerals affect the brain.

“The brain and mental health are no longer just ‘above the neck' problems.”

Deficiencies in several different micronutrients, including magnesium, B vitamins, vitamin D, omega-3s, choline, and L-theanine have been shown to affect mental health conditions. Researchers can induce anxiety in mice, for example, by manipulating and lowering their magnesium levels. The extent to which supplementation affects mental health in humans is less well-established.

The research so far is a little sparse and mixed. A 2024 review found that “supplemental magnesium is likely useful in the treatment of mild anxiety and insomnia,” especially in people with already low magnesium. But across studies, results showing how much magnesium supplements can help people with mental health conditions like anxiety or depression are often inconsistent, likely because there are so many different forms these supplements can take.

Magnesium, for example, can be taken as a supplement in the forms of magnesium citrate, magnesium malate, magnesium glycinate, magnesium oxide, magnesium chloride, and more. How well the body can make use of magnesium in these different forms, and how good these different forms are at delivering magnesium to the brain still needs to be better studied, says Alexander Rawji, a psychiatrist in Long Island, New York, and the lead author of the paper. Similar challenges exist for other micronutrients.

As you may have learned in high school biology, eating varied foods rich in certain vitamins and minerals is crucial because your body cannot make its own supply and yet relies on them to perform critical functions. And research suggests that most Americans don't get nearly enough of many micronutrients. Previous national survey data said that as much as 94 percent of the US population does not get adequate daily vitamin D, 52 percent don't get enough magnesium, and 92 percent don't get enough choline.

Few people would argue that diet is completely unimportant for brain health. But while a connection between nutrition and brain health is clear, the persistent gaps in scientific knowledge make it difficult to really say what role supplements should play in the treatment of mental illness. Ideally, future research would get us to a place where we better understand how micronutrients in the diet distinctly affect the workings of the brain, as well as which supplements are best absorbed by the body and brain. On top of that, we don't even fully understand the mechanisms that cause most mental health disorders.

Once her blood test results came back, Dupas' psychiatrist put her on a regimen of supplements — magnesium, L-theanine, B-complex vitamins, and omega-3s — in addition to a small dose of an SSRI. But Dupas didn't stay on the medication for long. After a couple weeks, “I felt really clear again,” she says. “I could focus again and not feel paranoid that people are coming after me.”

Dupas could be an outlier. Research suggests the vast majority of people with a mental health condition won't see dramatic improvement of their symptoms from supplementation alone. Nevertheless, she's grateful that she stumbled across a doctor who actually ordered bloodwork to see if there may be any hidden culprits exacerbating symptoms and hopes more patients get similar treatment.

Providers should be ordering bloodwork for patients, especially if they have multiple health conditions and medications that could be affecting their health, Rawji says. And if they have a deficiency, that's certainly something to address. A complicating factor, however, is the fact that blood panels can't always give you a perfect picture of what's going on — tests to detect magnesium levels in blood serum often come back normal even if their body stores of magnesium are low.

Regardless, Rawji uses supplements as “part of a multipronged approach” in his treatment of patients, he says. How much the supplements will help will vary person to person, and they definitely shouldn't replace other treatments, including medications like SSRIs or benzodiazepines. “If you expect magnesium to be a benzo for anxiety then you're going to be very disappointed,” he adds.

Not all psychiatrists are trained to ask questions related to diet when assessing patients or to look for nutrition deficiencies, according to Naidoo, the doctor from Mass General. This could lead to ignoring relatively easy interventions that can make real differences. Furthermore, overemphasizing supplements comes with its own risks. If you eat a healthy, well-balanced whole foods diet, you'll probably get more than enough of the vitamins and minerals you need.

There's “almost always” an opportunity to use nutrition to improve mental health, since no one really has a perfect diet, says Naidoo. If you're particularly concerned with including more of certain micronutrients into your diet, she suggests eating more green leafy vegetables, nuts, and legumes for magnesium. Milk, eggs, and whole grains are good sources of B vitamins; eggs, beans and cruciferous vegetables are good for choline; fatty fish and eggs are good for vitamin D; and you can get L-theanine from green tea.

Nutrition is a huge, consequential tool for how we maintain our bodies. And we understand, now more than ever, that the importance of food for the body includes benefits for the brain. “The brain and mental health are no longer just ‘above the neck' problems,” Naidoo says.

If you care about happiness, well-being, or growth, you should care about GDP.

In 1972, the King of Bhutan announced that “gross national happiness is more important than gross domestic product.” It was a charming sound bite that captured imaginations worldwide. Finally, someone was brave enough to say it: Happiness matters more than money.

At the time, Bhutan was poor. More than 50 years later, Bhutan still ranks near the bottom of countries globally in per capita gross domestic product (GDP), a metric that captures the dollar value, per person, of the goods and services that a country produces.

In Bhutan today, life expectancy is 73 years — higher than the 51 years in 1972, but still only right at the world average. Meanwhile, politicians are concerned about “unprecedented” levels of people leaving the country, mostly for economic opportunities elsewhere. While Bhutan's own Gross National Happiness surveys show rising happiness since data collection started in 2010, internationally comparable surveys show a fall in self-reported happiness in the country.

South Korea took the opposite approach. In 1961, General Park Chung-hee seized power in a country with a GDP per capita of around $93, well below even Bhutan at the time. His goal was modernization: build industries, end dependence on US aid, and export goods to the global market competitively. To track progress, his government launched five-year economic development plans with specific targets measured by economic growth.

While we don't have information on South Korea's level of happiness at the time, other results suggest a rapidly improving quality of life. Life expectancy rose from 54 in 1960 to 66 by 1980 to 83 today, a decade higher than in Bhutan. Infant mortality fell by roughly 97 percent. A country devastated by war and dependent on foreign aid became the world's 14th largest economy. GDP per capita went to over $30,000. The five-year plans used GDP to measure progress, and the GDP numbers tracked real transformation.

This comparison reveals the importance of GDP. Bhutan explicitly prioritizes happiness over economic growth, but its happiness has increased only marginally, and the country has not experienced the broader improvements in living standards that matter to people. South Korea pursued concrete development goals, used GDP to measure progress, and succeeded at economic transformation. South Korea hasn't prioritized happiness metrics, but, in surveys of self-reported happiness, remains consistently ahead of Bhutan.

Today, GDP faces fierce criticism from economists, journalists, and even Elon Musk, all of whom argue it doesn't capture what really matters. Critics love proposing alternatives, such as happiness indices, well-being measures, and sustainability metrics. Yet all of these critiques have a common flaw. They are correct that GDP isn't a perfect measure of human flourishing, but it does reliably capture whether your economy is actually developing. And economic development is the foundation that makes progress on many other goals possible.

To understand why GDP remains indispensable, we need to look at what it actually is. GDP is a “national account,” or a record that tracks all the economic activity in a country. Think of it as a country's financial statement, similar to how a business tracks its revenues and expenses.

In the early 1930s, Congress tapped economist Simon Kuznets to develop the first national account. The government wanted to know whether the economy was recovering from the onset of the Great Depression, and if so, how fast, and by how much.

Before that, policymakers had price indices and production numbers, but they lacked a comprehensive measure of economic activity. Creating one required Kuznets to solve a series of conceptual and practical problems: how to aggregate millions of transactions across different industries, how to avoid double-counting when one business sells to another, and how to collect data from businesses that had never reported such figures before. Kuznets gave them such a measure.

The history of GDP is interesting, but the important part for people today is what the number means. GDP measures the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given time period. Each of these words matters. Let's go through them in a logical order.

If Ford buys steel from US Steel to make a truck, GDP only counts the truck's sale price, not both the steel and the truck.

The “market value” part means GDP uses the prices at which goods and services actually sell. In its measurement, a $50,000 car counts 50,000 times more than a $1 soda. The “final” part prevents double-counting. If Ford buys steel from US Steel to make a truck, GDP only counts the truck's sale price, not both the steel and the truck. The steel's value is embedded in the truck's price. Since we are looking at gross domestic product, we only want to look at things produced within a country, not what people buy.

The “total” seems straightforward: We don't want to just look at one part of the economy, like manufacturing. In practice, we can only get to the total value by adding up different categories of the economy — everything from groceries to software to net exports (exports of American-made products to other countries minus imports).

This is similar to how your personal budget line items tell you whether you're spending more on housing or entertainment. These categories help break down where economic activity occurs, but they are not GDP itself. GDP is the total. Accordingly, some critiques of GDP — such as when Patrick Fitzsimmons recently wrote that GDP is “completely wrong” and “totally broken” — are really critiques of how to interpret those specific components and which interpretations get used in public discourse, not of GDP itself.

It should be immediately apparent what GDP leaves out. GDP was designed to measure market production, so it doesn't count unpaid work. If you cook dinner for your family, that doesn't show up in GDP. If you pay someone to cook dinner for you, it does. Spending to rebuild after a hurricane adds to GDP, even though the hurricane itself destroyed wealth. Moreover, GDP doesn't track environmental costs. While people talk about “the cost of carbon,” most of the time, it is not a price that anyone actually pays, so it's not counted.

GDP doesn't measure income distribution. GDP doesn't distinguish between activities that improve welfare, like going to a movie, and activities that respond to problems, like deciding to buy a new lock because crime has risen. None of these missing parts is hidden or controversial.

The critiques of GDP come from different angles. The first concerns what GDP measures. For example, in 2009, the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, led by Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, argued “What we measure affects what we do; and if our measurements are flawed, decisions may be distorted.” And because GDP leaves some stuff out, it is flawed as a measure, according to the commission.

Yet this critique judges GDP against a standard it was never designed to meet and that no one ever claimed it met. No metric is all-encompassing. Kuznets himself warned Congress in 1934 that “the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income.” The people who created GDP knew what they were building: a measure of market production, not a measure of human flourishing.

A slightly different line of critique, as Stiglitz has argued elsewhere, is that focusing on GDP makes policymakers “more materialistic” and leads them to neglect policies that would improve health, education, wealth equality, and the environment. Similarly, journalist David Pilling argues in The Growth Delusion that our fixation on GDP growth can justify destructive policies that lead to environmental degradation and growing inequality.

Yet these critiques are more aimed at politicians who focus on GDP than on the measure itself. The critics position themselves as revealing that we need multiple measures, but no country has ever made decisions based solely on GDP growth. Governments do also pay attention to these other issues.

Ultimately, Stiglitz's own commission recommended maintaining GDP as part of a broader “dashboard” of indicators. Pilling, after cataloguing GDP's limitations, concludes it “should definitely not be scrapped.”

GDP carries weight as a metric for good reason; despite its narrowness, it relates closely with nearly every outcome people care about.

For example, people in countries with higher GDP per capita live longer. While detractors sometimes point to cherry-picked examples, such as New Zealand, which has a lower GDP than the United States but higher life expectancy, that's not the case in general.

Higher GDP per capita also correlates with lower infant mortality, higher educational attainment, reduced extreme poverty, and higher self-reported happiness. This last point deserves emphasis: life satisfaction, the primary measure used in the World Happiness Report and similar well-being indices that critics often propose as alternatives to GDP — itself highly correlates with GDP.

The closest thing to an exception is environmental quality, which often shows a U-shaped relationship with GDP. Pollution tends to rise in early stages of economic growth before declining as countries grow wealthy enough to invest in clean technology and environmental protection. For wealthy countries like the United States, higher GDP does seem to correlate with improving environmental quality.

And these correlations make sense. Economic production is the foundation of tons of other things we care about. You can't have broad or universal health care without the economic capacity to pay for it. You can't fund education, build infrastructure, or protect the environment without resources. And GDP tells you how much resource-generating capacity you have by looking at how much you are doing right now.

These correlations explain the appeal of GDP, but not why it, uniquely, is the measure of choice. Why does nearly every country produce GDP estimates quarterly? Why do markets and policymakers treat it as such an important economic indicator? Simply put, GDP has practical advantages that no alternative measure can match.

For most countries, for more policy decisions, what we need is to build productive capacity, and raising GDP captures whether they're succeeding.

The most important advantage is the timeliness. In the United States, the Bureau of Economic Analysis releases preliminary GDP estimates roughly one month after each quarter ends, with revisions following as more complete data arrives. This frequent reporting allows governments to spot recessions early and adjust policy accordingly, as they hoped to do during the Great Depression. By contrast, Bhutan's latest Gross National Happiness data is from 2022. Presumably, that could be sped up with more funding, but I'm not sure happiness rising from 0.76 to 0.77 from July to August is going to help Bhutan's central bank when setting interest rates.

The importance of accurate, up-to-date data became painfully clear during the policy mistakes of the 1970s. As economist Athanasios Orphanides has documented, faulty GDP data, caused by measurement problems and data revisions, led the Federal Reserve to believe that the economy was operating further below its capacity than it actually was. As a result, the Fed pursued policies that accelerated inflation.

Statistical agencies have made substantial improvements since then. The Bureau of Economic Analysis now collects data electronically from businesses rather than waiting for paper forms. Preliminary GDP estimates arrive faster and with smaller revisions than in the 1970s, though measurement challenges remain.

Policymakers want timely GDP data so bad that the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta created GDPNow, a forecasting model that produces real-time estimates of GDP growth based on incoming economic data. Rather than waiting a month after quarter-end for the BEA's preliminary numbers, GDPNow updates continuously as new data on retail sales, industrial production, trade, and other indicators become available. It's still preliminary but highlights the importance of up-to-date data that is aggregated.

Given all of the effort put into improving GDP metrics over the years and across the world, we also have measures across time and place. While different countries' measures have different levels of reliability — for instance, China's numbers are always suspect — we can meaningfully compare economies across borders. We can compare GDP across decades, even centuries in some cases, to understand long-run growth patterns. This historical perspective is helpful for economic research and broader policy knowledge.

Are there situations where raising GDP might conflict with other goals? Sure. Trade-offs exist, but we shouldn't get bogged down in imaginary ones. There are people for whom training to become a faster 5K runner might hurt their marathon time. But that's really only if you're an elite athlete optimizing for specific events. For most people, like me, there is no real trade-off.

For most countries, for more policy decisions, what we need is to build productive capacity, and raising GDP captures whether they're succeeding. All the outcomes move together. Debating little trade-offs between GDP and alternative metrics misses the point.

No one wants to make it.

There's a reason dengue infections are also called “breakbone fever.”

Along with a mild fever, symptoms of the mosquito-borne illness include bone-deep, aching pain in the joints and behind the eyes. In severe cases, blood vessels begin to leak. And in the worst cases, that can lead to organ failure.

More than 14 million people contracted dengue last year, and the real number is likely several times higher. While it remains most common in South Asia and Latin America, it's no longer just a tropical disease. Warming temperatures are pushing dengue into southern Europe and the United States. Last year, Texas saw its highest case count in two decades, including locally acquired infections, meaning the virus is now circulating here, not just arriving with travelers.

The public health tools we have — the dengue vaccines, bed nets, fogging campaigns, public awareness to drain standing water — are all aimed at keeping mosquitos at bay and preventing infections in the first place. There's nothing for after: no antivirals — nothing like Paxlovid for Covid, or Tamiflu for the flu, or artemisinin for malaria. Once you're sick, the strategy is just supportive care and hope.

Earlier this month, though, that changed.

A new antiviral pill for dengue called mosnodenvir showed promising results in early phase 2 trials. In a study where volunteers were deliberately exposed to dengue, roughly half of those who received the highest dose never got sick at all. For a field that has struggled for decades to find an effective antiviral, it's the clearest evidence yet that a drug can prevent dengue — and researchers believe the same pill could eventually treat people who are already infected.

But, even before the results were published, Johnson & Johnson, the American pharmaceutical giant that developed mosnodenvir, had already abandoned any efforts to bring the drug to market.

Last year J&J announced it would wind down its dengue antiviral work, with a “strategic reprioritization” of its research toward non-communicable diseases like cancer and obesity. What this means is that one of the most promising dengue drugs ever tested is now without a pharma sponsor, waiting for someone else to carry it forward.

André Siqueira, who heads the dengue program at the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), said mosnodenvir is “very, very promising” and said he wants to see it pushed into further trials “as quickly as possible.”

But why — if the drug shows much promise — would its maker walk away?

J&J's exit isn't an outlier; it's part of a broader retreat from infectious disease research across the pharmaceutical industry, as companies shift toward drugs for wealthier markets: cancer, obesity, autoimmune disorders.

Dengue already kills thousands every year, and it's getting worse. By 2080, climate models suggest, nearly 60 percent of the world's population could be living in areas where dengue spreads.

And, in this new world, watching the first antiviral pill that works against dengue get abandoned — while the disease spreads to new continents — reveals the gap between the drugs we need and the drugs the market will deliver.

To test whether mosnodenvir actually works, researchers did something uncommon: They deliberately infected people with dengue.

Over the past three years, 31 volunteers in Baltimore and Vermont, in what's called a challenge trial, agreed to take a pill for several days and then get injected with a weakened dengue virus. It's a faster way to get answers than waiting for people to get sick naturally, but it requires volunteers willing to sign up for a controlled case of dengue.

Among people who got the highest dose of mosnodenvir, 6 out of 10 never developed an infection at all. The other four had much lower levels of virus in their blood and milder symptoms than the placebo group, where everyone got sick. At lower doses, the drug delayed infection but didn't prevent it — a clear signal that the higher dose was doing something real.

“It's one of the most beautiful dose-response results I've seen,” Anna Durbin, the Johns Hopkins researcher who led the study, told Science last month.

Then, there's the field data. In 2023, J&J launched a trial across more than 30 sites in South America and Asia to test whether the drug could protect people in the same household who are at high risk of getting bitten by the same mosquitoes. Among 265 people who received the highest dose, not a single person developed symptomatic dengue. In the placebo group, 60 percent did. (This data hasn't been formally peer-reviewed yet, but it's posted publicly.)

For Neelika Malavige, a prominent dengue researcher at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura in Sri Lanka, the significance goes beyond the numbers. “It's a huge scientific breakthrough just doing the study,” she said, referring to the design of the challenge trial itself, which had never been done for a dengue antiviral before. For a disease with no approved treatment, this is as close to proof of concept as it gets.

“The dengue community may be closer than ever to a long-awaited treatment,” Xuping Xie of the University of Texas Medical Branch wrote in a commentary accompanying the paper.

The trial proved that mosnodenvir can prevent infection, a first for any dengue drug. But prevention isn't what dengue doctors need most. What they need is a treatment, something to give patients who are already sick to keep them from getting worse.

That's what makes an antiviral so valuable. Prevention strategies have a ceiling; you can reduce mosquito populations, but you can't eliminate them, and warming temperatures keep pushing them into new territory. A drug that works after exposure would be the first tool that doesn't depend on stopping the mosquito first.

The hope is that the same drug could do both. Mosnodenvir works by blocking the virus from replicating, and, in theory, that should help whether you take it before you're infected or shortly after. The question is timing.

That's where dengue gets tricky. Unlike malaria, where the parasite lingers, and you can kill it with drugs, the dengue virus moves through the body notoriously fast. By the time a patient feels sick enough to see a doctor — usually a few days into the fever — the virus is often already on its way out. The brutal symptoms that follow, the blood vessel leakage and organ damage, are driven largely by the body's own immune response, not the virus itself.

As a global health reporter, this story felt grimly familiar. The things we pay attention to get solved, and so-called neglected tropical diseases have become something that just happens elsewhere. It's the reason why tuberculosis is still the deadliest infectious disease and why it took 35 years to develop the first malaria vaccine.

This line from a 2004 article captures this quite well: “Probably the worst thing that ever happened to malaria in poor nations was its eradication in rich ones.”

I grew up in Mumbai, where dengue was a regular occurrence every monsoon season. But the disease isn't staying there anymore. It's spreading — into southern Europe, into the United States — and the question of who develops drugs for it is no longer someone else's problem.

This is why antivirals have been so hard to develop for dengue. The window to intervene can be narrow, and for many patients, it's already closing by the time they show up.

The scientists who developed mosnodenvir believe it could work as a treatment. “If you reduce the amount of replicating virus, you will also reduce the likelihood that the patient evolves towards severe disease,” said Johan Neyts, a virologist at KU Leuven whose lab co-discovered the drug. The logic is in line with how antivirals for, say Covid, work, but this hypothesis hasn't been tested in humans. Treatment trials were planned in Singapore, but the Covid pandemic made them impossible. By the time restrictions lifted, J&J had already decided to exit.

The dream, Malavige said, is simple, “You go to the doctor, get yourself tested, the test is positive, you're given an antiviral, and that's the end of the story.” The question is whether patients can get there early enough — and whether mosnodenvir can work.

There's also the question of resistance. In the human challenge trial, genetic mutations emerged in the virus among nearly all the participants who took mosnodenvir — mutations that could, in theory, make the drug less effective over time. And some dengue strains already circulating in nature appear to be harder to treat with this type of drug.

This is a real limitation. Mosnodenvir alone probably isn't a long-term solution, because, eventually, the virus might adapt. But that problem is a familiar one for drug makers. HIV and malaria both evolved resistance to early drugs, and the answer was combination therapy: multiple drugs that attack the virus in different ways, making it far harder to escape all of them at once.

For that strategy to work with dengue, though, we need more drugs to combine. Mosnodenvir may not be the whole puzzle, but it could be the first piece. “If people stopped at the first sign of seeing trouble,” Malavige said, “then the world will not progress.”

Johnson & Johnson's exit follows a well-worn path for big pharma.

Over the past two decades, Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis, AstraZeneca, and other major drugmakers have all scaled back or abandoned infectious disease research, judging that these drugs simply couldn't compete with cancer and obesity blockbusters. A recent op-ed in the Financial Times called it a “textbook market failure.” The public health impact is massive, but the financial returns for addressing them aren't.

After J&J's exit, ownership of mosnodenvir is being transferred back to KU Leuven, the Belgian university where the drug was first discovered before J&J licensed it for development. “We will do all we can to make sure that mosnodenvir is further developed in clinical trials as soon as possible,” said Patrick Chaltin, who directs the university's drug discovery center. To do that, the university is working with the Wellcome Trust, a major global health funder, to find new partners and funding.

And fortunately, mosnodenvir isn't the only dengue drug that the pharmaceutical industry is looking into. The Swiss drug maker Novartis is running a phase 2 treatment trial for a different antiviral, and the Serum Institute in India is testing a monoclonal antibody.

Drug development is expensive and uncertain, and the people who need dengue treatments most are not the people who can pay the most. But these steps are encouraging.

In countries where dengue has always circulated — India, Brazil, the Philippines, Sri Lanka — people have learned to live around it, says Malavige. Life bends around when the mosquitoes are biting, and then bends back.

But dengue isn't locked in those places anymore. Warmer temperatures are carrying the mosquitoes — and the virus — somewhere new every year. And there's no sign that this expansion is slowing down.

Netflix's co-CEOs want to assure staffers that its bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's key assets will be good for the company — and for jobs across Hollywood.

In a letter sent to staffers on Monday, a copy of which was also filed publicly with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos said a combined Netflix-Warner Bros. is ""pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, pro-creator, and pro-growth.""

""We see this as a win for the entertainment industry, not the end of it,"" the Netflix co-CEOs wrote, addressing concerns that the combo of the streaming giant and one of the most iconic studios could bring about ""the end of Hollywood.""

Netflix this month announced its intention to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets for an equity value of $72 billion, which would be the biggest acquisition in the streamer's history.

Rival Paramount Skydance responded days later with a hostile bid to acquire all of WBD in a deal valued at around $108 billion.

Peters and Sarandos addressed the hostile bid in the letter, saying it was to be expected but that Netflix has a solid deal in place.

""It's great for our shareholders, great for consumers, and a strong way to create and protect jobs in the industry,"" they wrote.

The letter reiterated Netflix's previous arguments for why it's the best bidder for the WBD assets. Its bid faces strong opposition in parts of Hollywood, where many have long harbored suspicions toward Netflix because of its business model that has upended traditional film and TV conventions.

In particular, Netflix has favored a streaming-first distribution approach and has a practice of putting its movies in theaters for limited runs only. This has created tension with some big-name talent and movie theater owners. Sarandos previously said long, exclusive theatrical windows weren't ""consumer-friendly,"" and that he thinks, over time, theatrical windows will continue to shrink.

In terms of regulatory approval, both bidders have made the case that they have the clearest path to getting a deal through. Paramount chief David Ellison has said its combo would lead to less market concentration in streaming than Netflix's.

Netflix, for its part, wants regulators to compare its market share to total TV watching time, including free platforms like YouTube. The co-CEOs emphasized this in a letter. They say Netflix plus Warner Bros. would only be 9% of the US market, behind YouTube and Disney. Paramount's argument is that the market should be defined by paid streaming, which is growing and where Netflix stands to expand its dominance.

A wild card is President Donald Trump. David Ellison and his father, Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, are close to Trump, whereas Sarandos has long-standing ties to prominent Democrats. Still, Trump has publicly praised both Netflix and Sarandos. Trump also said that a combo of Netflix and Warner Bros. ""could be a problem"" due to the size, however.

When it comes to jobs, Netflix has lobbied Trump that it would be a job saver, not a job killer, since it wouldn't be combining two big studios like Paramount would. Some key numbers to look at are the planned ""synergies,"" which often translate in part to job cuts. Paramount estimated $6 billion, compared to Netflix's $2 billion to $3 billion.

Read the letter from Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos to staffers in full below:

OUR DEAL WITH WARNER BROS

By: Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos

As news around our deal with Warner Bros. continued this week, we wanted to keep you as informed as we can. Our position hasn't changed: we strongly believe that Netflix and Warner Bros. joining forces will offer consumers more choice and value, allow the creative community to reach even more audiences with our combined distribution, and fuel our long-term growth. We made this deal because their deep portfolio of iconic franchises, expansive library, and strong studio capabilities will complement—not duplicate—our existing business.

This is going to be a complex process over the next year or so and there's a lot we won't be able to share, but we did want to give you our thoughts on some of the most pressing questions we've heard since we connected last week.

How do we feel about Paramount's hostile bid? It was entirely expected. But, we have a solid deal in place. It's great for our shareholders, great for consumers, and a strong way to create and protect jobs in the industry. We're confident we'll get it over the finish line—and we're genuinely excited about what's ahead.

Are we confident regulators will approve? We believe in this deal—in the value it creates— and we're confident we'll get the approvals we need to make it happen. The fundamentals are clear: this deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, pro-creator, and pro-growth. Also, if you look at it through the lens of Nielsen data, even after combining with Warner Bros., our view share would only move from 8% to 9% in the US—still well behind YouTube (13%) and a potential Paramount/WBD combination (14%). We believe the facts speak for themselves, and we're fully prepared to put ourselves in a strong position for approval.

Will we preserve theatrical releases as part of WBD's distribution model? Yes—we're fully committed to releasing Warner Bros. movies in theaters, just as they do today. Theatrical is an important part of their business and legacy, and we don't want to change what makes Warner Bros. so valuable. If this deal had happened two years ago, hits like Minecraft and Superman would still have premiered on the big screen as they did—and that's how we plan to keep it. We haven't prioritized theatrical in the past because that wasn't our business at Netflix. When this deal closes, we will be in that business.

Some feel this is the end of Hollywood. What's our response to that? This is something that we've heard for a long time—including when we started the streaming business. Our stance then and now is the same—we see this as a win for the entertainment industry, not the end of it. This deal is about growth: Warner Bros. brings businesses and capabilities we don't have, so there's no overlap or studio closures. We're strengthening one of Hollywood's most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production.

What's next? We've got a small but mighty team of experts working on this so the rest of us can stay focused on the big 2026 ambitions we've established for our business. We've got huge potential still ahead of us—even before we factor in Warner Bros.—so our focus should remain on realizing that potential based on our organic growth. We know that's easier said than done with all the headlines and speculation, but continuing to deliver for our members is the best thing we can focus on.

Where is the best place to follow along? As a reminder, Take 5 is for employees only. We've launched a public site as our source of truth for external audiences—which will be updated further—and it's a resource you can share with friends and family who might have their own questions. You can also listen to our UBS webcast from earlier this week.

A new law barring children under 16 from opening or maintaining social media accounts took effect last week in Australia, forcing platforms to deactivate accounts for swaths of young users.

In the words of Taylor Swift, however, Reddit would very much like to be excluded from this narrative because, it says, it's not a social media platform.

Reddit made the argument in a lawsuit it filed against the Commonwealth of Australia and its Minister of Communications on Friday. The Australian law is meant to protect young people from what it says are the harmful and addictive effects of social media use.

Reddit is seeking to overturn the country's new law, which it says ""infringes the implied freedom of political communication.""

As part of the legal filing, Reddit also pushed back at being labeled an ""age-restricted social media platform"" within the meaning of Australia's law.

Instead, Reddit said it ""operates as a collection of public fora arranged by subject.""

""That is because it is not the case that the sole purpose, or a significant purpose, of Reddit is to enable 'online social interaction' between two or more end-users,"" the company said in its 12-page legal filing.

The company added that, in most cases, users don't know each other's real identities.

""Reddit does not import contact lists or address books. The 'upvote/downvote' functionality enables users to indicate how helpful they found the information that was posted by an end-user,"" the company said in the lawsuit. ""It is not intended to be used as a way for users to express any view about the poster themselves. In this way, Reddit is significantly different from other sites that allow for users to become 'friends' with one another, or to post photos about themselves, or to organise events.""

Reddit, founded in 2005, allows users to post and reply to those posts on ""subreddits"" dedicated to almost any topic imaginable. Users have the option to upvote or downvote posts and can send each other direct messages. While Reddit users can use their real names, most of them operate anonymously.

The company went public in 2024 with a valuation of $6.4 billion.

Reddit elaborated on its argument in a statement addressed to its users, which was shared on the platform last week.

""This law is applied to Reddit inaccurately, since we're a forum primarily for adults and we don't have the traditional social media features the government has taken issue with,"" the company said in the statement.

Australia's new law, which would place the onus on social media platforms to verify users' ages, has drawn criticism from other companies it targets as well, such as TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.

Reddit, which says it is complying with the law, told its users that doing so could have unintended consequences.

""This law has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions), and creating an illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren't,"" the company said.

Australia isn't the only country considering restricting social media use among young people.

Malaysia plans to ban children under 16 from having social media accounts in 2026. In Norway and Denmark, lawmakers have proposed laws that would ban social media accounts for children under 15.

A handful of US senators earlier this year introduced the Kids Off Social Media Act, which would bar social media platforms from allowing children under 13 years old to create or maintain accounts. The act would also bar platforms from using algorithms to target children under 17.

""Australia is stepping up to protect kids from the addictive and harmful content being constantly fed to them on social media. It's now time for Congress to do the same and pass the Kids Off Social Media Act,"" Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, a Democrat, said in a statement to Business Insider.

AI may be blamed for this year's layoffs, but a new global survey says the technology could fuel a rebound in some entry-level hiring next year.

Public-company CEOs say AI is creating more jobs in 2026, according to an annual outlook survey conducted by advisory firm Teneo released this month. Sixty-seven percent of the CEOs surveyed said they expect AI to increase entry-level hiring in 2026, and 58% said they plan to add senior-leadership roles as well.

The report said that firms are ramping up hiring in engineering and AI-related roles. Many existing jobs are being reconfigured or reassigned as certain tasks become increasingly automated.

The survey, conducted between October 14 and November 10, gathered responses from more than 350 global CEOs leading public companies with at least $1 billion in annual revenue, as well as about 400 institutional investors representing $19 trillion in portfolio value.

The findings run counter to the prevailing narrative that AI is automating entire jobs away.

""It's not that AI is wiping out the workforce today — it's reshaping it,"" said Ryan Cox, Teneo's global head of AI.

The hiring momentum mirrors a broader surge in corporate AI investment. Sixty-eight percent of CEOs said they plan to increase AI spending next year, up from 66% in 2025. Nearly nine in 10 CEOs said AI is already helping their organizations navigate disruption.

All that spending has raised expectations. More than half of investors said they expect AI initiatives to show results in under six months. CEOs aren't so sure: Only 16% of leaders at large-cap companies — with annual revenue of $10 billion or more — said such fast returns are realistic.

Fears that AI will eliminate human jobs have intensified as more companies announce layoffs tied to automation.

HP said in a November earnings report that it plans to eliminate between 4,000 and 6,000 roles by the end of 2028 — a move expected to save about $1 billion. IBM announced in November that it would reduce its workforce by a ""single-digit percentage"" in the fourth quarter of 2025.

But the shift isn't as simple as workers being replaced by machines. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told CNN in October that the company is simultaneously shifting head count toward AI and quantum computing, and plans to ramp up hiring of college graduates in the next year. AI adoption has also driven demand for programmers and sales employees, he told The Wall Street Journal in May.

AI has created new job categories as it reshapes old ones. Titles such as decision designer and AI experience officer are emerging in the workforce, workplace experts said in a Business Insider report earlier this month. These roles focus on guiding AI systems and enhancing human-AI collaboration.

This essay is based on a conversation with Jan Gerber, 44, who runs the Paracelsus Recovery clinic in Zurich. Business Insider has verified his admission to another Swiss clinic for burnout. The piece has been edited for length and clarity.

In 2022, I realized something was wrong. I had almost lost my company, my marriage was falling apart, and it felt like everything hit all at once. I did outpatient therapy while things were unraveling, but I was clearly getting worse.

About six months later, that December, I checked myself into an inpatient program in Zurich, where I was diagnosed with acute depression brought on by stress. The symptoms fit burnout, too — burnout and depression often overlap.

At the time, I had spent 12 years helping other people recover from burnout, depression, and addiction. I'm the founder of Paracelsus Recovery, a private clinic in Zurich that treats executives, founders, and ultra-high-net-worth individuals who require discreet and private care. A six-week stay can cost around $800,000.

This is the third installment of Business Insider's five-part series, The Burnout Cure, which examines how people recognize burnout, confront it, and rebuild their lives on the other side. Check out their stories below and share yours here.

I was an ambitious Amazon exec who solved my burnout without skipping a beat at work. Here's how.

I burned out from 2 years of job hunting, so I changed everything about how I apply. I won't let the job market break my spirit anymore.

It all started when a friend of a friend, the CEO of a major, publicly listed corporation, called my parents, who worked in the mental health space, for help, and moved into their guest room for treatment. The person needed very discreet treatment for alcohol addiction — if it went public, the stock market impact could have been in the billions.

I previously worked in consulting and medical concierge services, and had launched my own businesses in the travel sector. So, the entrepreneur in me realized there was a niche here: offering discreet treatment for people who couldn't just go to any old rehab.

In 2011, I co-founded a clinic in the high-end mental health space with my mother and then step-father, which initially offered one-on-one care. In 2012, this became Paracelsus Recovery.

In the early years of Paracelsus Recovery, we had a small number of clients, but it took years to establish a reputation. The high cost is a big hurdle for potential clients. We primarily find ultra-high-net-worth clients through family offices and membership organizations, such as Campden Wealth.

About half are members of wealthy families, the second or third generation with trust funds who often don't develop a sense of purpose or drive. The other half is a mix of royalty, entertainers, entrepreneurs, founders, and top executives — those who have the funds to come to us.

Clients rarely experience burnout on its own. In many cases, people are self-medicating and in a cycle of taking downers like sleeping pills in the evening, then stimulants in the morning, such as ADHD medication or illicit drugs like cocaine. Eventually, they reach a dead end.

Often, burnout is not solely prompted by the number of hours worked, but also by the responsibility of overseeing thousands of employees, investors, and business partners, which weighs heavily on their shoulders. If you're in the public eye or run a public company, where, for example, earnings aren't meeting expectations, that can also have a significant impact on stress levels.

The average worker typically seeks burnout treatment after a spouse, their kids, or employer tells them they can't show up late or get drunk every night anymore. Founders and professional executives tend to have much more to lose, and a network of people who help them conceal some of their issues. As a result, they'll hold on for dear life until they just can't anymore. And, in general, they seek help much later.

Sleep is usually the first to go. That was a massive red flag for me. I used to be a good sleeper, even in stressful times, but it started to deteriorate — not just a week or a month, but about half a year of restless nights. By the time these CEOs seek treatment, it's often when a substance is involved, and it's showing up as a fatty liver or cardiovascular issues, coming from alcohol abuse, for example.

We offer a 10-day program called an ""Executive Detox."" These programs don't solve everything, but they stabilize clients and buy them some time. On average, people stay with us for six weeks; however, in extreme cases, they may stay for six months or more.

A week at Paracelsus Recovery costs around £100,000, or about $131,000. This includes a private residence, a chef, a driver, a live-in therapist, and a daily schedule of psychotherapy, medical treatments, infusions, and complementary therapies such as yoga, acupuncture, and fitness training.

My own treatment at another clinic encouraged me to introduce treatments such as shiatsu and breath-work.

Success is relative. For me, it mostly means that someone leaves equipped with the tools to live a better life. Treatment at a clinic like Paracelsus Recovery is what I consider an acute stabilization, while the real work happens afterward. People should have ongoing therapy and support.

To recover from burnout, the most vital thing — and it's hard for career executives and entrepreneurs to hear — is to pull the emergency brake. If you continue to hold on for another week, another month, or step back halfway while the stress persists, you'll still crash.

You have to decide between investing in the quality of your life over just your career trajectory.

Personally, I didn't do that. For the sake of business continuity, I had to hang on. I still haven't fully recovered. I still feel brain fog from being burned out, and my memory is worse than it was. I'm not sure if it will ever return.

But my own experience, and my treatment at another clinic in Zurich, taught me about the value of proper inpatient treatment.

At Paracelsus Recovery, we typically treat only three or four clients at a time, which makes for a warmer and more personal experience, whereas the Swiss Clinic I attended had a capacity of about 75 patients.

Our patients stay in penthouse apartments with lake views, where most of their treatments take place. No day is like another, as treatment is tailored for each client. They have access to medical treatments, a midday IV to rebalance their biochemistry, as well as a personal trainer and private chef. Their food and supplements are curated based on their lab tests and genetics.

Yes, the price tag is very high, but you get a lot for your money. Besides, there's no price on health and well-being.

The Trump administration on Monday unveiled a new initiative dubbed the ""U.S. Tech Force,"" comprising about 1,000 engineers and other specialists who will work on artificial intelligence infrastructure and other technology projects throughout the federal government.

Participants will commit to a two-year employment program working with teams that report directly to agency leaders in ""collaboration with leading technology companies,"" according to an official government website. 

Those ""private sector partners"" include Amazon Web Services, Apple, Google Public Sector, Dell Technologies, Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI, Oracle, Palantir, Salesforce and numerous others, the website says.

The Tech Force shows the Trump administration increasing its focus on developing America's AI infrastructure as it competes with China for dominance in the rapidly growing industry. 

The initiative was announced four days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at establishing a national AI policy framework — a priority for industry leaders who opposed states crafting their own regulations.

Once Tech Force members complete their two terms, they can seek full-time jobs with those companies, who have committed to consider the programs' alumni for employment. The private partners can also nominate their employees to do stints of government service.

Annual salaries will likely fall in the range of $150,000 to $200,000, plus benefits.

""We're trying to reshape the workforce to make sure we have the right talent on the right problems,"" U.S. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Monday morning.

The engineering corps will be working on ""high-impact technology initiatives including AI implementation, application development, data modernization, and digital service delivery across federal agencies,"" the site says.

Kevin Hassett's candidacy for the Federal Reserve chair, once seen by the market as almost a sure thing, has received some pushback by high-level people who have the ear of President Donald Trump, according to sources familiar with the matter.

There's concern that the National Economic Council director is too close to the president, the sources said, something that ironically made him the frontrunner to replace current chair Jerome Powell in the first place. The pushback could help explain why interviews with candidates were cancelled in early December and then, at least for Warsh, rescheduled for last week.

After telling reporters that he knew who he was going to pick for Fed chair, Trump surprised investors Friday when he told the Wall Street Journal in an interview that former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh had moved to the top of the Fed candidates list alongside Hassett. The comments sent Hassett's odds diving on the Kalshi prediction markets.

""I think the two Kevins are great,"" said Trump.

Hassett remains the favorite on Kalshi Monday with a 51% chance, although that's down from a high above 80% earlier this month. Warsh's odds are currently 44%, up from around 11% to start December.

The pushback has taken more of the form of promoting Warsh, rather than criticizing Hassett. On Thursday at a JPMorgan event, CEO Jamie Dimon spoke favorably of both Hassett and Warsh, but made some comments that made those in the audience believe that Dimon favored the former Fed governor.

Bloomberg News reported at the end of November that Hassett had emerged as the frontrunner to replace Powell, whose term ends in May. 

But as December wore on, according to several sources, Hassett's candidacy received some resistance, with worries growing that the bond market could revolt over time if it sees him as too much in the pocket of Trump. That view could end up having the opposite effect Trump wants, with long-term yields eventually rising on concern Hassett wouldn't do enough to contain inflation should it ever rebound down the road. 

Perhaps in response to some of this criticism, Hassett was more firm on the question of Fed independence in an interview with CBS News this past weekend. 

Trump ""has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors, at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be,"" said Hassett on ""Face the Nation,"" according to a transcript.

When asked if the president's view would carry the same weight as a voting central bank member, Hassett said: ""No, no, he would have no weight. It's just his opinion matters if it's good, you know, if it's based on data.""

In this article

Thrive Holdings, launched by OpenAI and Stripe investor Thrive Capital, announced on Monday that it's tapped Palantir veteran Jim Siders to serve as CEO of Shield Technology Partners, a newly created business focused on IT services. 

Siders spent more than 12 years at Palantir, where he most recently served as chief information officer, overseeing global IT operations, business applications and infrastructure. He began his career at the company as an IT helpdesk engineer. 

Palantir has been one of the best performers on the stock market during the artificial intelligence boom, jumping by almost thirtyfold since the end 2022.

Thrive, founded by Josh Kushner, launched Thrive Holdings in April, creating a division to own and operate companies that it believes could benefit from technological transformations. Shield was launched in June by Thrive Holdings and investment firm ZBS Partners, with over $100 million in initial funding. 

Shield buys ownership stakes in IT services companies and tries to help them grow by giving them access to cutting-edge AI technology and engineering capabilities. 

""If we're doing this right, we're going to see a lot of value created all the way up the chain, from end customer all the way through to us here at Shield,"" Siders told CNBC in an interview. ""These are great businesses, and they're going to be rising up even more.""

As of December, Shield works with seven companies and is expected to generate more than $100 million in revenue this year, Thrive said. Shield primarily works with small and mid-sized businesses, and has ambitions to expand its portfolio going forward.

In addition to its work with Shield in IT services, Thrive Holdings also operates in the accounting sector. 

Earlier this month, OpenAI announced it took an ownership stake in Thrive Holdings and will embed engineering, research and product teams within its companies.

""We said, 'The way in which we're going to achieve the best results for our customers is if OpenAI is an owner in Thrive Holdings alongside us,'"" Anuj Mehndiratta, a member of Thrive Holdings' founding team, said in an interview. ""By being an owner, they will be enabled to actually focus on end outcomes in the same way that we are.""

Shield's ownership structure is based on a similar line of thinking. To help align incentives and encourage companies to participate, the IT services organizations that Shield backs retain equity in their companies.

Siders kicks off his tenure as Shield CEO on Monday, and he said his initial focus will be on understanding its existing partners and searching for potential targets. He said Shield will be ambitious in the next few quarters.   

""There's a whole industry out there, people who've spent their careers trying to deliver this value for everybody's benefit,"" Siders said. ""This is a unique and special thing to attack that.""

Correction: A prior version of this story mischaracterized part of the agreement between Shield and the organizations it backs. Those businesses retain equity in their companies.

President Donald Trump slammed Rob Reiner on Monday morning, a day after the famed Hollywood director and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found brutally slain in their Los Angeles home.

Trump's social-media screed against Reiner, who was a staunch critic of the president, came as the Reiners' 32-year-old son, Nick, was arrested and held on $4 million bond, according to LA County Sheriff's Department jail records. That online record for Nick Reiner did not show any charges.

Trump suggested that the couple was killed because of ""the anger"" Rob Reiner caused in other people due to his opposition to the president. 

However, there is no evidence to suggest that this is the case, and the police have not provided any motive.

""A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

""Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS,"" Trump wrote.

""He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before,"" the president wrote. 

""May Rob and Michele rest in peace!""

Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, called out Trump for his post.

""Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered,"" Massie wrote.

""I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it,"" he added.

Massie has been targeted by Trump for months after co-sponsoring a petition in the House that led to passage of a law directing the Justice Department to release its investigative files about notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. Trump had opposed that law until the last minute.

Reiner blasted Trump in an MS Now interview in October.

""Make no mistake; we have a year before this country becomes a full-on autocracy, and democracy completely leaves us,"" Reiner said in that interview.

""And we're  looking at the election in 2026, and Donald Trump knows that in a free  and fair election, he will lose,"" Reiner said. ""He will lose the House, the House will  flip and will become in Democratic hands. There will be committee chairs  who will be able to hold meetings, and this is the last thing he  wants.""

Reiner's movies included ""This is Spinal Tap,"" ""The Princess Bride,"" ""When Harry Met Sally,"" and ""A Few Good Men.""

He first gained fame as playing the son-in-law of Archie Bunker on the classic television show ""All in the Family.""

This is CNBC's Morning Squawk newsletter. Subscribe here to receive future editions in your inbox.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Rotation was the word on Wall Street's lips last week as investors iced out high-flying artificial intelligence stocks in favor of more traditional and cyclical names. Now, the question is whether that divergence will continue, as focus shifts to upcoming inflation and employment data.

Here's what to know:

Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh has made his way to the top of Trump's list of candidates to lead the central bank. 

Trump told The Wall Street Journal on Friday that Warsh is a top contender for the role, joining National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett as a front-runner to succeed Jerome Powell. ""I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both — I think the two Kevins are great,"" the president told the paper, adding that ""there are a couple of other people that are great.""

Trump also repeated his belief that the next Fed chair should consult the president on interest rate decisions, saying, ""I'm a smart voice and should be listened to.""

A new CNBC investigation found that in the midst of this fall's record-setting government shutdown, dozens of U.S. Food and Drug Administration staffers traveled to a Singapore resort.

Thirty-one staffers ranging from deputy directors to a program coordinator traveled to Singapore in mid-November to attend a conference of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, according to internal FDA documents obtained by CNBC. In total, the trip cost the agency more than a quarter of a million dollars, or nearly $8,000 per attendee.

The travel was approved even as the FDA operated with reduced staffing and resource constraints amid the 43-day shutdown. The trip also comes as the agency faces a proposed 11.5% budget cut, broad layoffs and tumultuous leadership. In a statement to CNBC, the FDA said that sending employees to the conference was ""mission critical."" A spokesperson for the agency also noted that this year's delegation of staffers was smaller than that of the past two years.

Trump wants to make domestic shipbuilding great again, but as CNBC's Lori Ann LaRocco reports, he'll need help from international companies.

China wins as much as 75% of new ship orders and has more than 200 times the building capacity of the U.S., data shows. There are currently eight active U.S. shipyards, compared to China's more than 300.

As it tries to bolster the U.S. shipbuilding industry and make up ground, the Trump administration is tapping companies like South Korea's Hanwha through investment deals. As Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst at Xeneta, told CNBC: ""When you look at the orders, making American shipbuilding great again is a tall order. Foreign expertise needs to be brought in.""

Netflix will release the final episodes of its hit series ""Stranger Things"" at the end of the month, marking the end of an era. After being passed over by studio after studio, the underdog series has become one of the biggest success stories of the streaming world.

As CNBC's Sarah Whitten reports, the streaming giant has launched dozens of partnerships across merchandise and food tied to the 9-year-old series. Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the franchise was akin to a ""'Star Wars' moment"" for the streamer, given the show's role in shaping pop culture and leading to live events.

European defense companies fell on Monday as talks over a potential peace agreement to end the war in Ukraine took a new turn.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said over the weekend that Ukraine was prepared to abandon the country's longstanding aim of joining the NATO military alliance in exchange for alternative security guarantees to protect it from Russia. Joining NATO is unlikely given some members' opposition, but the announcement marks a major policy shift by Ukraine.

Rheinmetall, Germany's largest arms manufacturer, traded 1.9% lower at 2:48 p.m. in London (9:48 a.m. ET), paring earlier losses.

The company, which also makes air defense systems, anti-tank weapons, armored vehicles, and ammunition, led the sector's losses, as German counterparts Hensoldt and Renk slipped into negative territory.

Hensoldt, the military technology and surveillance specialist, was 1% off in afternoon deals, while tank maker Renk traded 1.1% lower. Swedish fighter jet manufacturer Saab traded slightly lower. 

Zelenskyy's offer to ditch Ukraine's long-term NATO ambitions came during talks with U.S. officials Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, which are continuing this week. Kyiv is now seeking separate security guarantees from the West, which it sees as vital to any lasting ceasefire. 

Zelenskyy said in a WhatsApp discussion with reporters on Sunday that such security guarantees would ""provide an opportunity to prevent another outbreak of Russian aggression.""

Russia remains steadfast in its opposition to any Ukrainian membership of NATO.

Protracted discussions on how to end the near four-year-long conflict — which entered a second day in Berlin on Monday — have thrust the continent's defense industry back into the spotlight.

The Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense Index was last seen 0.3% higher on Monday, erasing earlier losses. The benchmark has soared more than 50% year-to-date.

SINGAPORE — Sentosa Island boasts the luxury, five-star Ora and Michael hotels, with palm-tree-lined pools, lobbies flanked with luxury stores, and a casino that adjoins both hotels and buzzes with gamblers. The Singapore resort is also where a group of federal employees from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were sent for a work trip in the final hours of the government shutdown. 

Internal FDA records obtained by CNBC show 31 agency staffers traveled to Singapore in mid-November for a conference of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH — a trip that cost more than a quarter of a million dollars, or upward of $8,000 per person, according to the documents. The travel was approved when the agency was operating with reduced staffing and limited resources in part due to the shutdown. 

The FDA is under significant pressure. The Trump administration proposed an 11.5% cut to the FDA's budget this year. Nearly 1,900 staffers were laid off, and around 1,200 others took early retirement packages, according to May testimony from FDA Commissioner Marty Makary. In addition, senior leadership has been in upheaval, and former FDA chiefs have publicly questioned the agency's handling of key issues such as vaccine policy. 

The FDA attendees at the Singapore conference ranged from deputy directors to a program coordinator, records show. Their travel was approved about one week before the end of the government shutdown — the longest in U.S. history, at 43 days. Most staffers departed on Nov. 12, the same day the U.S. House of Representatives voted to end the shutdown, and the remaining travelers left Nov. 13 and 14, according to the documents. 

The ICH, registered as a nonprofit under Swiss law, says it aims to unify the global standards for drug development and approval. The conference, held Nov. 18-19, took place in a series of meeting rooms on the island resort grounds.

ICH told CNBC in an email that ""approximately 500 people attended in person,"" including regulators and pharmaceutical industry experts from around the world. It also wrote that the ""FDA is one of the founding members of ICH"" and helps develop the requirements for ""safe, effective, and high-quality pharmaceuticals.""

As part of the November assembly, three guidelines were adopted that aim to streamline global drug development and safety monitoring, according to the ICH. In a follow-up email, the organization said the first guideline provides a template to eliminate ""inconsistent formats"" in clinical trial protocols and ease electronic data sharing. The second seeks to ensure post-approval safety reports are ""complete, accurate and timely"" by aligning definitions and reporting practices, it said. The third adopted guideline sets international standards for noninterventional, real-world data studies to ensure they are ""scientifically sound"" and comparable across regulators. 

FDA staffers contributed to all three of these guidelines, according to conference documents.

The FDA said in a statement to CNBC that sending staffers to the meeting was ""mission critical"" and that the purpose of the conference was to ""support global alignment on drug development, approval standards, and regulatory science."" A spokesperson for the agency said the conference required approval from leadership, including the FDA's chief operating officer, Barclay Butler. Attendance by FDA delegates in the prior two years ranged from 47 to 49, the spokesperson said, noting this year the agency sent 31.

Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, acting vice president of policy and government affairs at the Project On Government Oversight, a nonpartisan watchdog group that champions government accountability, said the optics of sending dozens of FDA staffers to an overseas conference during a government shutdown are not good. 

""FDA is a critical organization that does really important work as far as our health-care system, our food system, our medical device system,"" Hedtler-Gaudette said. ""I would hope that FDA leadership and the administration would place a higher degree of priority on making sure the organization, the agency is resourced completely rather than needing to attend specific conferences or events.""

Hedtler-Gaudette said that even if the conference is important, that does little to quiet questions about the agency's priorities. 

""At a minimum, it's a kind of bad look and it's poor optics,"" Hedtler-Gaudette said. ""At the worst, it could be a kind of a dereliction of duty and a misuse of public resources.""

The FDA told CNBC the trip did not rely on taxpayer dollars, saying it was funded through the agency's carryover user fees — money collected from companies that make drugs, devices and other medical products to pay for regulatory work such as product reviews and inspections. 

""Those dollars are still public dollars,"" Hedtler-Gaudette said. ""They still need to be treated and guarded with as much respect as direct tax dollars do.""

An internal email from Butler, dated Oct. 1, said user fees should be applied only to work that is permitted to be funded by user fee carryover and ""activities that are necessary to address imminent threats to the safety of human life or protect property."" 

The FDA itself seemed to be aware that any travel during the shutdown could be poorly received.

""Due to the optics of business travel conducted during a shutdown, conference approval will be handled by FDA's senior leadership on a case-by-case basis,"" the FDA said in a document that was posted on its website as recently as mid-November. On Dec. 3, the day after CNBC asked the agency for comment on the document, it was no longer available on the website.

""The agency routinely updates its webpages to ensure information remains accurate and consistent with current policy,"" an FDA spokesperson told CNBC.

In an internal email chain between FDA directors and Chief Financial Officer Benjamin Moncarz, obtained by CNBC, Director Michelle Tarver sought to ""come to an agreement for legal and optics consistency on how we are handling travel during the lapse in appropriations."" Tarver proposed to ""cancel conference attendance and the associated local, domestic, and international travel."" She went on to say that the FDA would ""allow virtual speaking on exempt (i.e., user fee) topics only.""

In a Nov. 6 email exchange about the ICH conference, the discussion of whether to send staffers to Singapore rose to the highest ranks of the FDA. In the email, FDA Deputy Chief Financial Officer Sahra Torres-Rivera wrote that the agency had ""agreed to limit in-person participation at conferences"" but noted that ""the final decision ultimately rests with ... leadership."" 

Next year, the biannual conference will be held in Rio de Janeiro and Prague.

Ukraine has said it's willing to give up its aspirations to join NATO in return for security guarantees, as part of a peace deal to end the almost four-year war with Russia.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offered to drop Kyiv's NATO dreams during five hours of talks with U.S. officials Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Berlin over the weekend. Witkoff said ""a lot of progress was made"" during the talks, which are set to continue on Monday.

Ukraine's offer marks a major policy shift. It has long coveted membership of the Western military alliance, whose members are obliged to consider an attack on one as an attack on all under Article 5 of the NATO treaty.

Zelenskyy said on Sunday that the offer to drop NATO membership in return for security guarantees was a compromise, amid resistance among some of its Western allies to its NATO bid.

""From the very beginning, Ukraine's conditions – or perhaps more accurately, our ambition – was NATO membership. And that would have provided real security guarantees. Some partners from the United States and Europe did not support this direction,"" he said in answer to questions from reporters in a WhatsApp chat on Sunday.

""That is why today the bilateral security guarantees between Ukraine and the United States, specifically Article 5–like guarantees from the United States for us, and the security guarantees from our European colleagues for us, as well as from other countries such as Canada and Japan – these security guarantees for us provide an opportunity to prevent another outbreak of Russian aggression,"" Zelenskyy commented.

""And this already is a compromise on our part,"" he said.

Despite Ukraine publicly abandoning its NATO bid, the chances of it joining the alliance were vanishingly thin. Several members were resistant to the idea, including Moscow-friendly Slovakia and Hungary. Even Ukraine's allies within NATO worried about poking the Russian bear beyond Ukraine's borders.

Moscow vehemently opposes Ukraine joining NATO, and Russia has claimed the alliance's expansion in Eastern Europe was one of the reasons it launched its so-called ""special military operation"" against Ukraine in 2022.

Kyiv insists that security guarantees must be a part of a peace deal instead of NATO membership, and this remains a sticking point in negotiations with Moscow, which is refusing to allow Ukraine's allies to be part of any peacekeeping force in the country.

Talks about a draft peace agreement are continuing on Monday. Zelenskyy aide Dmytro Lytvyn said that the president would comment on the talks once they were completed, Reuters reported.

The Kremlin said Monday that it expected to be briefed later on the outcome of talks between Ukraine and the U.S. on Monday.  When asked to comment on Kyiv relinquishing its NATO ambitions, and what security guarantees Russia could accept in a potential peace deal, Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said:""This issue is one of the cornerstones. And, of course, it requires special discussion against the background of all the others. But that is precisely what the negotiation process consists of, which I would like to emphasize once again - we do not want to engage in megaphone diplomacy.""

The sell-off in artificial intelligence stocks continued unabated Friday stateside. Broadcom shares tumbled more than 11% as investors grew concerned over lower margins and uncertain deals. Names such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Oracle fell in sympathy, which caused major U.S. indexes to close lower.

It was a motif patterning the week. Even though the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1% week on week on the back of outperformance by financial stocks, tech names dragged down the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, which fell 0.6% and 1.6% respectively for the week.

That said, investors could have just been jittery amid the narrative of an apparent AI bubble, and were spooked by any sign of bad news. After all, Broadcom's earnings — as well as its guidance for the current quarter — breezed past expectations.

""Frankly we aren't sure what else one could desire as the company's AI story continues to not only overdeliver but is doing it at an accelerating rate,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, who has a ""buy"" rating on Broadcom, wrote in a Friday note.

Future prospects also look rosy, according to UBS. ""We expect high profitability and the accelerating impact of the AI, power and resources, and longevity themes to drive 2026 performance,"" said strategist Sagar Khandelwal.

But in the near term, investors may still be flighty, unless something concretely reassuring, such as Oracle achieving positive cash flow, reassures them the snapping sound is just a twig in the forest.

U.S. stocks dragged down by AI names. Major indexes fell Friday, a day after they hit record highs. Asia-Pacific markets traded lower Monday. South Korea's Kospi retreated roughly 1.5% as of 2:45 p.m. Singapore time (1:45 a.m. ET), leading losses in the region.

China's economic slowdown deepens. Even though the country's retail sales and industrial production grew year on year in November, their increase missed forecasts and slowed from the previous month. Investment in fixed assets in the January-to-November period contracted from a year earlier.

Copper could hit ‘stratospheric new highs' as hoarding of the metal in U.S. continues

Copper prices have hit multiple record highs this year, fueled by supply disruptions and as fears over U.S. tariffs have led to a surge in demand. The rally is set to continue into 2026.

Citi analysts expect prices of the red metal to skyrocket on the back of stronger demand led by the energy transition and artificial intelligence sectors. Electrification, grid expansion and data-center build-outs require large amounts of the metal for wiring, power transmission and cooling infrastructure.

To justify a case for martial law, former President Yoon Suk Yeol tried to provoke neighboring North Korea into taking military action, South Korean prosecutors alleged Monday, according to domestic media. 

Speaking to reporters, special counsel Cho Eun-suk said that Yoon and his military commanders tried to lure North Korea into mounting an armed aggression against the South, but this failed as Pyongyang did not resort to military force. 

Cho and his team have indicted 24 people, including Yoon and five cabinet members, on insurrection charges following a six-month investigation.

Earlier this month, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung had said on the 1-year anniversary of Yoon's short-lived martial law declaration that North Korea sending of trash balloons over to South Korea might have been provoked by Seoul's actions, although he did not elaborate at that time.

Lee had also vowed ""strict accountability"" for the perpetrators behind the failed martial law attempt, with investigations and trials still underway.

In July, Reuters reported that the special counsel had sought to detain the head of a military drone unit, over accusations that Yoon had ordered a covert drone operation into North Korea to raise tensions between the two countries.

Cho also said that Yoon had masterminded a plan in October 2023 to suspend the powers of South Korea's parliament and replace it with an emergency legislative body. 

South Korean media outlet Yonhap also reported that Yoon also sought to portray the April 2024 general election results, lost by his ruling party, as electoral fraud led by anti-state forces.

The 2024 election saw the then-opposition Democratic Party, led by Lee, hold on to its majority in the National Assembly. 

After being removed from office in April, Yoon has been charged with insurrection, which carries the maximum penalty of death.

South Korean prosecutors have also reportedly sought a 15-year prison term for former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo. Other senior officials, including Yoon's defense minister and the former head of the National Intelligence Service, have also been arrested in connection with the attempt to impose military rule.

On Dec. 3 last year, Yoon had abruptly declared martial law in a late night address, before lawmakers — including members of Yoon's own party — rushed to overturn his order. Yoon withdrew his decree six hours after his announcement. 

Imposing martial law led to impeachment motions against Yoon, which resulted in him being impeached on Dec. 14 last year and removal from office on April 4.

BitMine Immersion Technology (BMNR), the largest Ethereum treasury company, continued its splurge, buying 102,259 in ether ETH$3,125.57 through last week, worth roughly $320 million at recent prices.

The latest acquisition, reported on Monday, brought the firm's stash to nearly 4 million tokens, aiming to corner 5% of ether's supply. The company kept its cash holdings steady at $1 billion, while its total holdings — including a minor bitcoin BTC$85,780.72 stack and stake in Worldcoin-focused digital asset treasury Eightco (ORBS) — stood at $13.2 billion. 

Most digital asset treasuries have slowed or reversed accumulation as token prices and equity valuations came under pressure in in the past months. There's only a few exceptions such as BitMine and bitcoin-centric Strategy (MSTR) that kept adding to their holdings through the correction. However, BitMine is estimated to sitting on around $3 billion in unrealized losses on its ETH holdings, as the second-largest cryptocurrency is trading 36% lower than its August record-high.

""2025 saw many positive developments in digital assets,"" said chairman Thomas Lee, who's also the founder of analytics firm Fundstrat, ""including positive legislation passed by the US Congress and favorable regulations, and by strengthening support from Wall Street.""

""These strengthen our conviction that the best days for crypto are ahead and why we continue to accumulate ETH towards our 'alchemy of 5%' target,"" he added.

Crypto pundit Crypto Wimar has explained why the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP prices crashed, highlighting the continuous selling pressure. The crypto market is also at risk of further downward pressure due to macro factors such as the impending Japan rate hike. 

Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP Prices Crashed

In an X post, Crypto Wimar revealed that Wintermute has dumped 40% of its holdings over the last three weeks, which has contributed to the crash in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP prices. The crypto pundit further noted that the market maker is still dumping millions in BTC and ETH on Binance, which puts these coins at risk of further declines. 

The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP prices are also crashing as crypto market investors brace for a Japan interest rate hike by the BOJ at their December 19 meeting. Polymarket data shows that there is currently a 97.4% chance that the BOJ will increase rates by 25 basis points. A Japan rate hike impacts the crypto market as it puts the yen carry trade in focus, with investors moving to sell their assets before the yen strengthens and their debt becomes more expensive. 

Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP prices have crashed after every Fed rate cut this year. This similar price action is playing out as the Fed lowered rates by 25 bps last week. These crypto assets had seen a notable rebound prior to the Fed rate decision last week, indicating that the cut was already priced in. 

Demand for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP also appears to be dwindling, even among institutional investors. Crypto analytics platform CryptoQuant stated that Bitcoin treasury growth is losing momentum, noting that the accumulation pace is slowing despite the fact that 117 new companies added BTC to their treasuries this year. Ethereum treasury company BitMine is also the only company that has continued to accumulate ETH at an impressive pace amid this market downturn. 

BTC At Risk Of Drop Below $50,000

Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has indicated that the Bitcoin price could still drop below $50,000, which also puts Ethereum and XRP at risk of crashing. In an X post, the analyst raised the possibility that a BTC bear pennant is forming.

He noted that this is not a structure that market investors will typically want to see in a bull market. Titan of Crypto added that the structure is still developing, but it is one that is worth monitoring closely. 

Meanwhile, the analyst's accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin price could drop below $50,000 as soon as February next year. It is worth mentioning that veteran trader Peter Brandt had also earlier predicted that BTC could drop below $50,000 based on his belief that the flagship crypto is already in a bear market.

Ripple, the payments-focused blockchain firm closely related to the XRP Ledger (XRP), is taking its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin RLUSD$0.9998 to Ethereum layer-2 (L2) blockchains including Optimism, Coinbase's Base, Kraken's Ink and Uniswap's Unichain in a push to embed the $1.3 billion token deeper into the multichain ecosystem.

The company, announcing the move Monday, said it is starting with a test phase ahead of a wider rollout expected next year, pending regulatory approval by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).

The pilot integrates Wormhole's Native Token Transfers (NTT) standard, which allows RLUSD to move natively across chains without wrapping or synthetic assets. This helps maintain liquidity and regulatory control while supporting a range of decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases across networks optimized for speed and lower costs.

Stablecoins are rapidly growing as a key piece of digital-finance plumbing connecting traditional finance and the crypto economy. They are a $300 billion class of cryptocurrencies, with prices pegged to fiat money like the U.S. dollar.

Originally available on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger networks, RLUSD is issued under a NYDFS Trust Charter. Ripple obtained initial approval for a federal trust bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) last week, which would make RLUSD the first stablecoin under both state and federal regulatory oversight.

""Stablecoins are the gateway to DeFi and institutional adoption, Jack McDonald, senior vice president of stablecoin at Ripple, said in a statement. ""By launching RLUSD — the first U.S. Trust Regulated stablecoin on these L2 networks — we are not just expanding utility; we are setting the definitive standard where compliance and onchain efficiency converge.""

The rollout also supports a wrapped version of the XRP token (wXRP), making it easier for holders to use XRP alongside RLUSD for swaps, lending and payments across supported chains, the statement said. For example, a retail crypto user could soon convert wXRP to RLUSD within a DeFi app on Optimism or Base without leaving the chain.

The crypto market began the week as it ended the last: little changed in the past 24 hours as sentiment slumped back into the ""extreme fear"" zone.

The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) Index is up by 0.16% on Monday while the CoinDesk 80 (CD80), which is a broader basket of crypto tokens, is down by 0.77%, underscoring the weakness of the smaller, risker altcoins.

JPMorgan is set to offer clients access to a tokenized money market fund as part of Wall Street's latest crypto push.

The bank announced that its asset management arm will launch a tokenized money-market fund that will run on the ethereum blockchain. My OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY) will be supported by Kinexys Digital Assets, the bank's tokenization platform.

MONY will hold short-term debt and issue daily interest payouts in the same way traditional money market funds do. The key difference lies in the fact that its shares will exist on the ethereum blockchain network, and investors can redeem them using either cash or the USDC stablecoin.

The new fund, which The Wall Street Journal reported will be offered to wealthy clients and institutions, will have a minimum investment of $1 million. Its launch is the latest crypto move from the bank, which also recently tokenized some private equity investments in October.

It's also the latest crypto push from Wall Street broadly. Asset management titans, including Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and BlackRock, have also been offering crypto investments and blockchain solutions for clients.

JPMorgan will commit $100 million of its own capital to the fund before officially opening it up to investors on December 16.

Despite some skepticism from CEO Jamie Dimon over the years, the bank has made inroads into crypto and has been recently bullish on the price of bitcoin. JPMorgan analysts said recently that bitcoin could buck its latest downtrend and reach $170,000 in 2026.

Asset tokenization has been in focus in 2025, with platforms like Robinhood framing it as a means of trading more efficiently or potentially gaining exposure to private investments.

The passing of the GENIUS Act, meanwhile, has offered support for stablecoins, a key component for tokenized funds like MONY.

The bank's asset management unit is deploying the fund on the Ethereum blockchain, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Monday (Dec. 15), adding that J.P. Morgan will seed the fund using $100 million of its own capital before opening it to outside investors Tuesday (Dec. 16).

According to the report, the private “My OnChain Net Yield Fund” (MONY) is supported by J.P. Morgan's tokenization platform, Kinexys Digital Assets, and will be open to investors with at least $5 million in investments and institutions with a minimum of $25 million. The fund requires a minimum investment of $1 million, the report added.

As the WSJ notes, Wall Street banks have expanded their tokenization projects in the wake of the GENIUS Act, which passed earlier this year and provides regulations for stablecoins. 

“There is a massive amount of interest from clients around tokenization,” said John Donohue, head of global liquidity at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “And we expect to be a leader in this space and work with clients to make sure that we have a product lineup that allows them to have the choices that we have in traditional money-market funds on blockchain.”

The bank's analysts had written in July that the tokenization of shares of money market funds could help keep those funds competitive with stablecoins and create new uses for them.

Those comments followed an announcement of a partnership between BNY and Goldman Sachs, in which the former bank would use the latter's blockchain technology to maintain a record of customers' ownership of select money market funds (MMFs). 

The companies called the project “a significant step towards enhancing the utility and transferability of existing MMF shares.”

J.P. Morgan also recently announced a tokenized a private-equity fund on its blockchain platform for the wealthy clients at its private bank. Weeks later, it introduced JPM Coin, a deposit token for institutional customers.

This is all taking place at a moment when, as PYMNTS noted in a recent report, blockchain technology is beginning to shift from a crypto-specific concept into a potential component of banking's central infrastructure.

“Once the domain of startups, it is now part of how global institutions such as Citi, J.P. Morgan, Visa and others are exploring the future of payments and liquidity management,” that report said. “From tokenized deposits and programmable payments to the settlement of digital assets, the technology previously seen as a niche outlier is increasingly being considered as part of the operating system for modern finance.”

In Brief

MetaSpace, a burgeoning name in the gaming industry, has recently unveiled a new system of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that places a strong emphasis on player ownership within its universe. These NFTs are not merely decorative but are fundamental assets that form the core of the gameplay, enabling players to own, use, stake, and trade them seamlessly across various facets of the game environment.

Introducing MetaSpace NFTsThe player-owned in-game assets with real utility.You can use them, stake them, trade them, and truly own them inside the MetaSpace universe.In this thread, we'll cover: • What MetaSpace NFTs are • Categories & Tier System• Why these NFTs… pic.twitter.com/sJLwIP2Gf4

In the MetaSpace ecosystem, NFTs are meticulously categorized to enhance the gaming experience:

Every NFT is aligned with a clear tier system — Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary — dictating its power and influence within the game. Higher-tier NFTs not only provide a superior gameplay experience but also hold more substantial potential value within the ecosystem, influencing both game progression and player interactions.

MetaSpace is setting a precedence in the gaming world by intertwining progression, ownership, and utility. Each NFT acquired and used by players does more than just enhance their immediate gameplay; it serves as a gateway to broader utilities and rewards within the evolving MetaSpace ecosystem. This includes exclusive events, airdrops, and additional perks that are accessible only to NFT holders.

As the MetaSpace universe continues to expand, the foundational NFT system is expected to integrate more functionalities, becoming a pivotal aspect of the game's infrastructure. This system is designed not merely as an addition but as an integral component that will continue to evolve, thereby sustaining and enhancing both player engagement and the overall value of the MetaSpace universe.

By aligning ownership with strategic gameplay elements, MetaSpace is pioneering a model where player investment extends beyond the digital realm, creating a dynamic and responsive gaming environment where every player's actions and acquisitions significantly impact their gaming journey and rewards.

THIS NEWS RELEASE IS INTENDED FOR DISTRIBUTION IN CANADA ONLY AND IS NOT AUTHORIZED FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UNITED STATES NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES

WHITE ROCK, BRITISH COLUMBIA / ACCESS Newswire / December 15, 2025 / Athena Gold Corporation (CSE:ATHA)(OTCQB:AHNRF) (""Athena Gold"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that, further to its news releases of November 17, November 24 and December 9, 2025, the Company has closed the second tranche of its private placement financing (the ""Offering"") and has received proceeds of CDN $270,499.98 through the issuance of 150,000 flow-through units (the ""FT Units"") at CDN $0.07 per FT Unit and 4,333,333 non-flow-through units (the ""NFT Units"") at CDN $0.06 per NFT Unit. An aggregate of CDN $2,727,526.03 was raised in the first tranche of the Offering.



Due to increased demand, the Company sought and received approval from the Canadian Securities Exchange to an increase in the Offering, to include an increase in the number of FT Units forming part of the Offering, from the original CDN $1,500,000 (21,428,571 FT Units) up to CDN $2,200,000, for an additional 10,000,000 FT Units. The total Offering now consists of up to CDN $4,200,000 consisting of (i) CDN $2,200,000 through the issuance of up to 31,428,571 flow-through units (the ""FT Units"") at a price of CDN $0.07 per FT Unit, (ii) CDN $1,100,000 through the issuance of up to 15,714,296 flow-through common shares (the ""CMETC FT Shares"") at a price of CDN $0.07 per CMETC FT Share, and (iii) CDN $900,000 through the issuance of up to 15,000,000 non-flow-through units (""NFT Units"") at a price of $CDN $0.06 per NFT Unit. All other terms and conditions remain constant.

Closing of the third tranche is expected to occur by the end of this week.

Each FT Unit is comprised of one flow-through common share (a ""FT Share"") and one-half of a non-flow-through share purchase warrant (a ""FT Warrant""), with each whole FT Warrant exercisable for one non-flow-through common share at an exercise price of CDN $0.09 for a term of 24 months after closing subject to an acceleration clause. If, at any time after the date that is 4 months and one day after the date of issuance of the FT Warrants, the average volume weighted trading price of Athena's common shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange is at or above CDN $0.14 per share for a period of 10 consecutive trading days (the ""Triggering Event""), Athena may at any time, after the Triggering Event, accelerate the expiry date of the FT Warrants by giving ten calendar days' notice to the holders of the FT Warrants, by way of news release, and in such case the FT Warrants will expire on the first day that is 30 calendar days after the date on which such notice is given by Athena announcing the Triggering Event.

Each NFT Unit is comprised of one non-flow-through common share and one non-flow-through share purchase warrant (a ""NFT Warrant""), with each NFT Warrant exercisable for one non-flow-through common share at an exercise price of CDN $0.09 for a term of 24 months after closing subject to an acceleration clause. If, at any time after the date that is 4 months and one day after the date of issuance of the NFT Warrants, the average volume weighted trading price of Athena's common shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange is at or above CDN $0.14 per share for a period of 10 consecutive trading days (the ""Triggering Event""), Athena may at any time, after the Triggering Event, accelerate the expiry date of the NFT Warrants by giving ten calendar days' notice to the holders of the NFT Warrants, by way of news release, and in such case the NFT Warrants will expire on the first day that is 30 calendar days after the date on which such notice is given by Athena announcing the Triggering Event.

Each of the FT and CMETC FT Shares will qualify as ""flow-through shares"" of the Company as defined in section 66(15) of the Income Tax Act (Canada). The CMETC FT Shares will also qualify for the Canadian government's Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit. Proceeds will be spent on the Company's Laird Lake and Oneman Lake Projects located in Ontario, that will qualify as ""Canadian Exploration Expenses"" and ""flow-through critical mineral mining expenditures"" as those terms are defined in the Income Tax Act (Canada), which will be renounced to the purchasers with an effective date no later than December 31, 2025.

The proceeds from the sale of the NFT Units will be used for additional exploration work on the Company's properties and for general and administrative expenses and working capital purposes.

No finder's fees were paid in connection with the closing of the second tranche, nor did any insiders participate in the second tranche.

All securities issued in connection with the Offering are subject to a four-month and one-day hold period.

None of the foregoing securities have been or will be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""1933 Act"") or any applicable state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the 1933 Act) or persons in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.

The post office has once again come under scrutiny after avoiding a fine for a data breach. In the data breach, more than 500 former post office workers who were wrongfully convicted during the Horizon IT scandal had their names and personal information leaked. Despite the seriousness of the breach, the post office received what equated to a light scolding from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). This course of action has sparked strong criticism from privacy groups and advocates for the victims.

Data breaches occurring in top governmental agencies like the post office once again bring into question the strength and readiness of public agencies' cybersecurity protocols. Amidst increasing occurrences of data and data breaches, cybersecurity experts are calling for government and federal agencies to adopt more stringent IT security measures.

Overview of the Data Breach

The breach involved the accidental publication of an uncensored legal settlement document that revealed the identities and addresses of more than 500 former post office employees.

As the news of the breach spread, commentators pointed out how data breaches create serious risks for victims. They highlight how the leaking of sensitive information can cause years of damage, like falling victim to online fraud or exploitation.

Examples of this have been seen in the online entertainment industry, where users' email addresses and passwords have been leaked, causing mass account takeovers. Video streaming platforms and social media have become popular online forms of entertainment.

These platforms have inherent security flaws though, as passwords can easily be hacked. For this reason, many online users are turning to platforms that run on more secure blockchain networks, such online games that include top crypto casinos. Firstly, these platforms offer much more entertainment value, providing users with access to thousands of online casino games. The major appeal comes from the safety and transparency offered by blockchain technology. Thanks to blockchain networks, these platforms offer provably fair games, faster and more secure transactions, and strong data protection.

How the Data Leak was Completely Preventable

The data breach happened when a member of the Post Office's press team uploaded an uncensored version of the 2019 litigation settlement to the agency's public website by mistake. Two months passed by before the file was finally removed. The presence of the file online was eventually brought to attention by an external law firm rather than internal safeguards. Further highlighting the agency's internal failings. ICO officials made it clear that the leak was preventable should proper publishing controls and data-handling procedures had been followed. A few major issues were pointed out by the ICO, mainly the lack of quality-assurance processes for online publication. In addition, the regulator pointed to minimal staff training and a lack of technical systems to detect or prevent the upload of sensitive data.

For the victims still dealing with the fallout of their wrongful convictions, the leak was just another institutional betrayal. Many of the workers whose information was leaked spent years trying to clear their names. They faced bankruptcy, damaged reputations, and in some cases, imprisonment.

Why the ICO Issued Only a Reprimand

The regulatory body sees the data breach as not serious enough to meet the requirements for a fine. Under its regulatory framework for the public sector, the ICO can impose financial penalties of up to £1.09 million for serious breaches. In the case of this leak, the ICO felt that a public admonishment would suffice instead of issuing a fine. This decision received strong criticism and backlash, especially from privacy advocates. Privacy advocates and cybersecurity groups argue that a public reprimand does nothing to remedy the situation. Instead, they argue, it gives public agencies the impression that they can continue to get away with data breaches unscathed.

The Open Rights Group called the decision “ludicrous”, warning that it risked sending the signal to other public organisations that a lack of proper data-protection standards carries few consequences. These concerns were mirrored by the victims of the breach and their legal representatives. They pointed out that data relating to exonerated individuals carries unique risks. In their criticism, they highlighted that a lack of fines or any tangible consequences minimises the harm caused and reduces the pressure on the Post Office to improve its internal processes and systems.

The Horizon Scandal's Lasting Impact

The Post Office's data breach cannot be separated from the history of the Horizon IT scandal. More than 500 post office employees, many of whom were sub-postmasters, were wrongfully accused of theft, fraud, and false accounting. These accusations were made after the Horizon software, which had software bugs, generated financial shortfalls in branch accounts. This software error caused many people to lose their livelihoods, their homes, and affected their mental health. In the worst cases, some were even imprisoned or died before their names could be cleared.

Compensation and Mitigation Measures Taken by the Post Office

After the data breach, the Post Office offered the victims financial compensation. While the compensation was a welcome relief, it was limited. Depending on the case, victims could receive up to £5000, with payouts based on whether the leaked addresses of the victims were current or outdated. Although some victims accepted the payout, critics of how the Post Office handled the situation say that the compensation was too little when compared to the seriousness of the breach.

Beyond financial settlements, the Post Office also offered two years of identity-protection services for the victims. These services included fraud monitoring, credit alerts, and dark-web surveillance. Again, these interim measures are aimed at helping the immediate victims of the data breach, but legal experts are still calling for more robust security systems and risk mitigation protocols to be put in place so that future breaches can be avoided.

Fact checked

By 99Bitcoins Editorial Team

The Bitcoin ecosystem is heading for its biggest ever upgrade as HYPER – a new Bitcoin layer2 blasts towards $30M raised in ongoing ICO.

Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has now secured $29.5 million in presale funding, and it's doing it by challenging one of Bitcoin's longest-standing limitations without touching Bitcoin itself.

As BTC slips back under $90,000, Bitcoin's price has always relied on belief, not usage, and that ceiling is starting to show. Bitcoin Hyper is built to break that ceiling by giving BTC a place to move, transact, and circulate at scale.

Instead of trying to “upgrade” Bitcoin, Hyper builds around it. Bitcoin stays exactly what it is – the final settlement layer – while everything that Bitcoin was never designed to do happens elsewhere. Execution lives in a high-speed environment, and applications finally get room to breathe.

That's why investors are stacking HYPER, the token designed to sit at the center of Bitcoin's transition from a static asset to a living economic network.

And for now, that entry still exists. HYPER is priced at $0.013425, but only for the next five hours before the next funding round begins.

As 2025 winds down, it will be remembered as the year Bitcoin first broke decisively into six-figure territory. Yet, the latest dip has revived a harder question. Is Bitcoin's store-of-value narrative still enough on its own to keep prices moving higher?

That question is also starting to surface in traditional markets. Strategy has come under pressure as index providers consider whether its heavy Bitcoin exposure justifies its inclusion in major benchmarks, such as the MSCI indices. 

JPMorgan analysts have warned that exclusion could trigger billions of dollars in passive fund outflows. At the same time, Strategy's shares have fallen far more sharply than Bitcoin itself, now trading closer to the value of the BTC it holds rather than at the premium investors once assigned to its treasury strategy.

https://twitter.com/_Adrian/status/1993333888974991842

Indeed, scarcity on its own may no longer be enough to drive Bitcoin higher. To reclaim and sustain six-figure prices and ultimately surpass prior highs, the network requires a fresh source of demand.

The base layer was intentionally designed to be minimal, conservative, and difficult to alter, i.e., a neutral settlement network that prioritizes security and verifiability above all else. That design choice is precisely why Bitcoin has survived for more than a decade without compromise.

But it also creates a constraint. That is, if Bitcoin must remain simple, then complex execution has to live elsewhere. There is no other path forward.

This is the gap Bitcoin Hyper is built to fill. Execution moves into a separate environment, while Bitcoin remains the final judge of truth.

Bitcoin was created to be an incorruptible form of money that no government, company, or small group could change, debase, or control. To achieve that, the system had to be unbreakable by design, even if that meant sacrificing speed or flexibility.

That's why Bitcoin relies on something as brutally simple as SHA-256: a one-way cryptographic function that does nothing fancy, but does one thing impossibly well. You can verify it instantly, but you can't reverse it – and that asymmetry is the foundation of Bitcoin's security.

https://twitter.com/SimplyBitcoin/status/1915522460184957421

Think of Bitcoin as bedrock. You don't carve tunnels into bedrock every time you want to build something new. You build on top of it because the stability beneath is what gives everything above it value.

As mentioned, Bitcoin's base layer was intentionally kept minimal and conservative from the start. Fewer moving parts meant fewer attack surfaces, lower governance risk, and a system anyone could verify without relying on complex logic. That restraint is exactly why Bitcoin has remained the most secure and decentralized network in the cryptocurrency space.

But bedrock isn't where you live, but where you build on. Advanced functionality was never meant to sit on Bitcoin's base layer, and forcing it there would undermine the very qualities that make Bitcoin valuable.

This is precisely the impetus for creating Bitcoin Hyper. It introduces an additional layer above Bitcoin where advanced functionality can live without altering the base chain.

That execution layer runs on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), removing execution from Bitcoin's slow base layer and placing it in an environment designed for speed and scale. It's where transactions are cheap and instant, and complexity is no longer a bottleneck.

What this creates is beyond just “hybrid apps,” but a structural shift. Bitcoin stops sitting still. BTC flows through DeFi, gaming, and real economic activity at Solana-level speed, while final settlement still snaps back to Bitcoin. Fast on the surface and immutable underneath.

This Bitcoin Hyper system is designed to do one thing that Bitcoin has never been able to do at scale: make BTC usable in everyday economic activity. Inside Bitcoin Hyper, applications are built to accept Bitcoin itself as the medium of exchange. To interact with them, users need BTC.

And that's where the shift happens. When applications require BTC to function, demand no longer depends solely on speculation or macro narratives but ultimately becomes structural. Bitcoin begins to behave less like dormant collateral and more like money circulating through an ecosystem.

But Bitcoin Hyper isn't just creating a new use case for BTC. It's also creating a second half of the economy that early Bitcoin believers once had access to. The execution layer needs fuel, and that role belongs to HYPER.

https://twitter.com/BTC_Hyper2/status/1998620068742312386

HYPER is the gas token that powers transactions across the network, the staking asset that helps secure it, and the governance token that shapes its evolution. It's the asset that captures the growth of activity happening on top of Bitcoin.

That's why more than $29.5 million has already flowed into the presale, as investors are placing early bets on the infrastructure they think Bitcoin will ultimately need to move higher. 

At its current presale price of $0.013425, many believe HYPER reflects the development-stage risk, rather than the value of a live ecosystem.

To acquire HYPER, visit the Bitcoin Hyper website and purchase HYPER using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or a credit card.

Bitcoin Hyper recommends Best Wallet – one of the best crypto and Bitcoin wallets in the market. HYPER already appears in Best Wallet's Upcoming Tokens section, which makes it easy to buy, track, and claim once the token goes live.

MEDIANAMA

Technology and policy in India

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar said that stablecoins do not serve any meaningful purpose in the financial system and that their claimed functions can be performed more effectively by central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). He made the remarks while speaking at the Mint Annual BFSI Conclave 2025 on December 12, 2025, in Mumbai. In his keynote address, Sankar presented a wide-ranging critique of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, while outlining why sovereign-issued digital money offers a safer alternative. 

At the outset, Sankar traced the evolution of money, arguing that although its form has changed with technology, its core attributes have remained constant. Money, he said, represents value that users trust, either through intrinsic worth or a promise to pay. Over time, he noted, the most stable forms of money have been issued by sovereigns rather than private entities. As a result, modern money derives credibility from its fiat nature, with both physical currency and digital bank deposits ultimately anchored to the central bank.

He also underlined the “singleness” of money, where different forms of money remain denominated in a single unit and exchangeable at par, with settlement taking place in central bank money. Against this background, Sankar said cryptocurrencies depart from these principles, as they do not represent intrinsic value or a promise to pay.

Stablecoins are a category of cryptocurrency that maintain a stable value by pegging themselves to a reference asset, most commonly a sovereign fiat currency such as the US dollar. In his speech, Sankar described stablecoins as crypto tokens where the issuer holds reserves, either financial or other assets, to keep their price stable relative to the underlying asset.

Unlike unbacked cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, stablecoins aim to reduce price volatility and operate as currency-like instruments. However, Sankar noted that it is often unclear whether stablecoin issuers make an unconditional promise to redeem tokens at par value, raising questions over whether they constitute a true liability of the issuer. Moreover, he said stablecoins represent private money rather than sovereign fiat, which weakens the “singleness” of money within an economy.

Globally used examples include dollar-pegged stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), which users widely rely on for settlement and trading within crypto markets. Asset-backed variants also exist, including gold-backed stablecoins such as PAX Gold (PAXG), where each token represents ownership of a specified quantity of physical gold.

The deputy governor said stablecoins are often presented as faster and cheaper alternatives, particularly for cross-border transfers. However, he argued that this claim does not apply in the domestic context, where India already operates real-time payment systems such as UPI that are “fast, low-cost, and reliable”. Furthermore, he questioned whether stablecoin issuers would command the same level of acceptability as closely regulated international banks backed by central banks, even in cross-border payments. Moreover, he said the supposed efficiency becomes doubtful in an ecosystem with multiple stablecoins rather than a single settlement instrument.

Turning to financial inclusion, he rejected the argument that stablecoins expand access to digital money for underserved populations. Financial inclusion, he said, “requires solutions that are accessible, affordable and safe”. Many countries, he added, have already advanced inclusion through digital public infrastructure and simplified account-opening frameworks, without introducing parallel private currencies. He also pointed out that stablecoins depend on smartphones, internet connectivity, and technical know-how, making them “clearly inferior” to fiat money as inclusion tools.

Finally, he addressed claims that stablecoins can act as a bridge between crypto markets and the real economy. Evidence so far, the deputy governor said, shows that stablecoins mainly facilitate trading and leverage within the crypto ecosystem itself, while their use as a transactional currency in everyday economic activity “remains limited”.

He concluded that the benefits cited by proponents are neither unique to stablecoins nor convincingly established, even as the risks they introduce remain significant.

The deputy governor warned that stablecoins introduce “significant concerns for monetary stability, fiscal policy, banking intermediation, and systemic resilience”, arguing that their risks extend far beyond illicit payments or regulatory arbitrage. He said these instruments pose structural challenges to how modern financial systems function.

Stablecoins, he said, could compete directly with domestic fiat money, reducing demand for the local currency and increasing the risk of “dollarisation”. He warned that stablecoins create pressure on monetary sovereignty through their currency-like design, even when they are denominated in domestic currency.

Turning to monetary policy, the deputy governor said widespread use of stablecoins would weaken central banks' ability to influence economic conditions. Quoting the IMF-FSB synthesis paper, he noted that “if both an official currency and a crypto asset are used for pricing goods and services, domestic prices could become highly unstable due to the inherent volatility of the crypto asset”. As households increasingly hold or transact in stablecoins, he added, changes in policy rates may have “limited influence” on economic decisions.

He also highlighted risks to capital account management, saying stablecoins could create channels for unmonitored inflows and outflows. Their pseudonymous structure, he said, would dilute the effectiveness of capital controls, which remain “a critical instrument for financial stability” in economies such as India.

On banking and credit intermediation, he warned that replacing deposits with stablecoins would either raise the cost of credit or force banks to rely on central bank liquidity. “A financial system that has to increasingly depend on central bank liquidity to fund commercial credit would not sustain,” he said.

Finally, he pointed to systemic risks and the loss of seigniorage, arguing that stablecoins divert income that “rightfully belongs to the Government” to private issuers. Even domestic-currency stablecoins, he said, do not eliminate these vulnerabilities.

The deputy governor said India should approach stablecoins with caution while actively promoting CBDCs as a safer and more effective alternative. He argued that India already operates an efficient and reliable payments ecosystem and therefore has “little justification” to integrate stablecoins into the financial system, even before accounting for the risks they pose.

At the same time, he acknowledged the potential of technologies such as blockchain and tokenisation, stressing that innovation should not come at the cost of monetary stability. Instead, he positioned CBDCs as the central pillar of India's policy response.

CBDCs, he said, are “digital tokens like stablecoins, yet they are inherently superior since they satisfy all the attributes that money should have, fiat, single, trusted and representing value”. Unlike stablecoins, they do not introduce risks linked to private issuance, currency substitution, or loss of monetary control.

He added that CBDCs can deliver all the functions claimed by stablecoins, including programmability, atomic settlement, and reduced cross-border frictions, while remaining fully anchored within the regulated financial system. Domestically, he said, India should encourage CBDC use by making it functionally similar to physical cash, including through “tiered anonymity”, such as anonymity for small-value transactions, to preserve user trust without weakening safeguards.

On cross-border payments, the deputy governor said much of the appeal of stablecoins lies in their promise of cheaper and faster international transfers. However, he argued that similar efficiencies can be achieved through bilateral or multilateral CBDC corridors. In parallel, he said, interlinking fast payment systems, including UPI with partner jurisdictions, already advances the G20 objective of improving cross-border payments, reducing the need for private digital alternatives.

The RBI Deputy Governor's remarks place India's digital currency debate firmly within the central bank's long-standing scepticism towards cryptocurrencies and privately issued digital money. Over the years, the RBI has repeatedly flagged concerns around financial stability, capital flow management, and monetary policy transmission, even as the regulatory framework for crypto assets has remained contested.

By explicitly arguing that stablecoins serve no purpose in India's financial system, the speech sharpens that position and reduces any ambiguity around the central bank's stance.

At the same time, the emphasis on central bank digital currencies outlines how the RBI intends to accommodate technological innovation without diluting monetary sovereignty. Rather than allowing private digital tokens to operate alongside the rupee, the central bank is signalling that sovereign-issued digital money will remain the preferred route for digitisation.

In effect, the speech clarifies India's policy direction at a time when global regulators continue to debate how far private crypto-based instruments should integrate with the financial system.

Rachel Reeves wants to protect consumers by bringing digital money and assets into the ‘regulatory perimeter'

Cryptocurrencies will be regulated in a similar way to other financial products under legislation coming into force in 2027.

The Treasury is drawing up rules that will require crypto companies to meet a set of standards overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

Ministers have sought to overhaul the crypto market, which has ballooned in popularity as a way of investing money and making payments.

Cryptocurrencies have not been subject to the same regulation as traditional financial products such as stocks and shares, which means that in many cases consumers do not enjoy the same level of protection.

The government said the new rules would make the crypto industry more transparent, boost consumer confidence and make it easier to detect suspicious activity, impose sanctions and hold companies accountable.

Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, said: “Bringing crypto into the regulatory perimeter is a crucial step in securing the UK's position as a world-leading financial centre in the digital age.

“By giving firms clear rules of the road, we are providing the certainty they need to invest, innovate and create high-skilled jobs here in the UK, while giving millions strong consumer protections, and locking dodgy actors out of the UK market.”

Crypto companies, which can include crypto exchanges and digital wallets, must register with the FCA if they provide services that fall within the scope of the UK's money-laundering regulations.

The changes mooted by the Treasury will bring companies that provide crypto services into the remit of the FCA and mean the services are regulated in the same way as other financial products, including by being subject to transparency standards.

Lucy Rigby, the minister for the City of London, said: “We want the UK to be at the top of the list for crypto assets firms looking to grow and these new rules will give firms the clarity and consistency they need to plan for the long term.”

The cryptocurrency market has suffered from turbulence amid growing investor fears about a potential artificial intelligence bubble.

Banking industry data in October showed that the amount of money lost to investment scams by UK consumers had surged by 55% in a year, with fake cryptocurrency thought to top the list.

A Chinese woman living in the UK was convicted in September over a multibillion-pound bitcoin fraud.

Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, orchestrated a fraud in China between 2014 and 2017 that left 128,000 people out of pocket. The 45-year-old stored the proceeds in bitcoin but UK authorities made a breakthrough in the case when they raided a Hampstead mansion in 2018 and seized devices from Qian holding 61,000 bitcoins, worth more than £5bn at current prices.

The Metropolitan police believe it is the largest single cryptocurrency seizure in the world. Qian pleaded guilty at Southwark crown court on Monday to acquiring and possessing cryptocurrency that was criminal property.

Ministers are also drawing up plans to ban political donations made with cryptocurrency, amid concerns that it is difficult to determine their origin and ownership.

Nigel Farage's Reform UK, which became the country's first party to accept contributions in digital currency this year, is believed to have received its first registrable donations in cryptocurrency this autumn. It has set up a crypto portal to receive contributions, saying it is subject to “enhanced” checks.

Key Takeaways

The U.S. banking system has quietly opened its doors to some of the crypto industry's biggest players.

Recently, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) conditionally approved  five crypto firms, including Ripple and Circle, to operate as national trust banks.

The decision marks one of the clearest signals yet that federal regulators are prepared to bring parts of the crypto sector inside the traditional financial framework.

Under the OCC's announcement, five companies received conditional approval to either establish or convert into national trust banks.

Once the regulator's requirements are fully met, they will join roughly 60 other national trust banks already overseen by the OCC.

The approved firms are:

National trust banks differ from traditional retail banks.

While the decision doesn't turn these crypto companies into full-service banks, it does grant them a regulated foothold inside the U.S. banking system.

They are not allowed to take deposits or issue loans, but they can custody assets, process payments, and provide fiduciary services under federal supervision.

All five firms must still satisfy capital, governance, compliance, and risk-management conditions before becoming fully operational.

The approval builds on a precedent set in 2021 , when Anchorage Digital became the first crypto-focused firm to receive a national trust charter.

Crypto companies largely welcomed the OCC's move as a long-awaited step toward regulatory clarity.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse celebrated the approval  as a “massive step forward,” particularly for Ripple's dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, which now sits under both federal oversight from the OCC and state supervision from the New York Department of Financial Services.

Traditional banking groups were less enthusiastic.

In a statement released Friday, the Bank Policy Institute warned that the decision raised unresolved questions about regulatory consistency and oversight.

“Today's decision by the OCC to grant conditionally five national trust charters leaves substantial unanswered questions,” the group wrote. “Chiefly, whether the requirements the OCC has outlined for the applicants are appropriately tailored to the activities and risks in which the trust will engage.”

The criticism reflects a broader concern among established banks that crypto firms could gain access to banking privileges without being subject to the same rules applied to traditional institutions.

Despite Ripple's prominence in the announcement, the approval does not directly authorize or regulate XRP itself.

The OCC's decision applies to Ripple's trust bank entity, which will focus on custody, payments infrastructure, and supporting stablecoin operations such as RLUSD.

XRP remains a separate asset, and its regulatory status is unchanged by the charter.

That said, the move could still have a lasting impact on XRP.

Ripple's deeper integration into the federal banking system may encourage more financial institutions to use its payments infrastructure, where XRP can function as a bridge asset for cross-border transfers.

Any such shift would likely play out gradually, as part of broader institutional adoption rather than a short-term market catalyst.

That distinction was reflected in the market's response.

XRP showed little immediate reaction to the news and was trading around $1.99, below the closely watched $2 level, amid a wider crypto market pullback in mid-December.

Taken together, the approvals underscore a broader shift in U.S. crypto policy—from enforcement-heavy oversight toward conditional inclusion.

By allowing firms like Ripple, Circle, Fidelity Digital Assets, BitGo, and Paxos to operate as national trust banks, the OCC is signaling that crypto companies can be part of the financial system, provided they meet the same supervisory standards as other federally regulated institutions.

For crypto advocates, it is a long-sought validation.

For critics, it is a test case that could redefine the boundaries of banking regulation.

Either way, the decision marks a meaningful turning point in how Washington approaches the future of digital finance.

HashKey, founded in 2018, is Hong Kong's largest licensed crypto exchange, the report said. Its other services include asset management, brokerage and tokenization. The company is due to begin trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Wednesday (Dec. 17).

The IPO is happening amid a roller coaster year for crypto prices, which reached record numbers during 2025, per the report. The most popular crypto, Bitcoin, fell by 36% in about a month after reaching an all-time high above $126,000 in early ⁠October.

Meanwhile, the Chinese government, which outlawed crypto trading in 2021, has restated its warnings about digital assets, the report said.

Last month, the People's Bank of China warned against a rise of crypto speculation and promised a crackdown on illegal activity tied to virtual currency. But Hong Kong operates with more economic freedom than mainland China and has embraced crypto in a bid to bolster its stance as a top financial center, according to the report.

This year has seen several companies in the digital asset space go public, such as Circle, Figure Technologies and Bullish. Crypto exchange Kraken filed for an IPO last month.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on Friday (Dec. 12) conditionally approved applications for new national bank trust charters to five applicants from the digital asset and blockchain finance space.

The approvals include de novo charters for Circle's First National Digital Currency Bank and Ripple National Trust Bank, along with conversions from state trust company charters for BitGo Bank & Trust, National Association; Fidelity Digital Assets, National Association; and Paxos Trust Company, National Association.

“A national bank charter can convey significant advantages, including the preemption of state banking laws in certain areas, access to the Federal Reserve payments system, and the license of federal supervision,” PYMNTS wrote at the time.

All of these can lower friction for scaling operations nationwide.

The five application approvals, which digital asset companies have long been seeking, mark a departure from the OCC's “more traditional trust bank cadre, which has historically been dominated by institutions focused on custodial and fiduciary services for conventional assets,” the report said.

Denver, CO, USA, December 15th, 2025, FinanceWire

AureaVault Trading Services Inc., a United States-based financial technology firm, today confirmed the expansion of its secure digital asset trading infrastructure to serve international markets, with a strategic focus on Mexico and Latin America. This move provides traders in high-growth emerging economies direct access to a platform operating under strict U.S. federal compliance standards.

As cryptocurrency adoption accelerates across Mexico—driven by high-volume remittance corridors and demand for inflation-resistant assets—investors increasingly seek alternatives to unregulated local entities. AureaVault addresses this market gap by offering a trading environment secured by FinCEN Money Services Business (MSB) authorization (Registration #31000309349610). This federal oversight ensures that AureaVault adheres to rigorous Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols, providing a “safe harbor” for international capital.

The platform secures 98% of user funds in air-gapped cold storage facilities. This physical isolation protects assets from online threats. Additionally, the system employs multi-signature technology and Hardware Security Modules (HSM) to prevent unauthorized access. Unlike exchanges that rely on “hot wallets” for liquidity, AureaVault prioritizes asset safety above aggressive expansion.

Engineered for High-Frequency Performance

Beyond security, AureaVault delivers the technical performance required by professional traders. The platform's proprietary matching engine handles millions of transactions per second with ultra-low latency.

This infrastructure supports:

Deep Liquidity: Ensuring competitive spreads on major trading pairs.

24/7 Stability: A microservices architecture ensures high availability, even during periods of extreme market volatility common in the crypto sector.

BitMine Immersion Technology (BMNR), the largest Ethereum treasury company, continued its splurge, buying 102,259 in ether ETH$3,125.57 through last week, worth roughly $320 million at recent prices.

The latest acquisition, reported on Monday, brought the firm's stash to nearly 4 million tokens, aiming to corner 5% of ether's supply. The company kept its cash holdings steady at $1 billion, while its total holdings — including a minor bitcoin BTC$89,629.86 stack and stake in Worldcoin-focused digital asset treasury Eightco (ORBS) — stood at $13.2 billion. 

Most digital asset treasuries have slowed or reversed accumulation as token prices and equity valuations came under pressure in in the past months. There's only a few exceptions such as BitMine and bitcoin-centric Strategy (MSTR) that kept adding to their holdings through the correction. However, BitMine is estimated to sitting on around $3 billion in unrealized losses on its ETH holdings, as the second-largest cryptocurrency is trading 36% lower than its August record-high.

""2025 saw many positive developments in digital assets,"" said chairman Thomas Lee, who's also the founder of analytics firm Fundstrat, ""including positive legislation passed by the US Congress and favorable regulations, and by strengthening support from Wall Street.""

""These strengthen our conviction that the best days for crypto are ahead and why we continue to accumulate ETH towards our 'alchemy of 5%' target,"" he added.

Crypto policy is shifting from talk to implementation as the OCC, FDIC and Federal Reserve begin to sketch a regulatory perimeter for stablecoins and tokenized deposits in the U.S., Bank of America said in a Monday report.

Recent approvals and proposals mark the start of a multi-year transition that could push more real-world assets and payments onchain, the analysts led by Ebrahim Poonawala said.

The OCC's recent conditional approval of national trust bank charters for five digital-asset firms is a meaningful step toward federal acceptance of stablecoins and crypto custody, analysts wrote. The charters open the door for digital-asset activity inside the regulated banking system, provided it is offered as a fiduciary service with strong liquidity, compliance and risk controls, according to the analysts.

The FDIC is expected to release a notice of proposed rulemaking this week detailing how payment stablecoins issued by subsidiaries of FDIC-supervised banks can be approved, the analysts noted. Those rules, required under the GENIUS Act, must be finalized by July 2026 and take effect by January 2027.

The report also highlighted comments from Federal Reserve officials indicating collaboration with other bank regulators on capital, liquidity, and diversification standards for stablecoin issuers, as mandated by the GENIUS Act. The analysts link this to a broader global push, highlighting a recent Bank of England proposal for a regime governing sterling systemic stablecoins, including asset-holding requirements and caps on exposures.

On the market-structure side, Bank of America highlighted JPMorgan and Singapore-based DBS, which are exploring an interoperable framework for tokenized value transfer across public and permissioned blockchains. 

That work, building on JPMorgan's JPMD tokenized deposit initiative, underscores a live debate over whether tokenized deposits are a better alternative to stablecoins, the report said.

Bank of America sees a plausible future in which transactions in bonds, stocks, money-market funds and cross-border payments migrate on-chain, supported by new rules and institutional-grade infrastructure. 

To prepare, banks will need not only fluency in blockchain but a willingness to experiment with tokenized assets and on-chain settlement, the report added.

Major cryptocurrencies fell during U.S. morning hours Monday, continuing a now crystal-clear pattern of relative poor performance while American stocks trade.

Trading fairly flat just below $90,000 overnight, bitcoin BTC$89,629.86 plunged to $86,800 in mid-morning U.S. action.

Bitcoin's poor relative performance during U.S. market hours suggests at first glance weak demand from American investors, but perhaps it has something to do with the mechanics of the spot bitcoin ETFs that opened for business in January 2024.

""Since the iShares Bitcoin ETF IBIT began trading, had you only owned it after hours (buy the close, sell the next open), it's up 222%,"" Bespoke Investment said in an X post. ""Had you only owned intraday (buy the open, sell the close), it's down 40.5%.""

Crypto stocks also started the week significantly lower with both Strategy (MSTR) and Circle (CRCL) both down about 7%. Coinbase (COIN) fell more than 5% while trading platforms Robinhood (HOOD) and eToro (ETOR) faced smaller declines of about 2%. Brokerage Gemini (GEMI), which soared late last week on approval for adding prediction markets to its offerings, pulled back 10% Monday.

Crypto miners, many closely attached to the data center infrastructure theme that took a hit last week amid artificial intelligence jitters, continued their downward trajectory. CleanSpark (CLSK), Cipher Mining (CIFR), Hut 8 (HUT) and TeraWulf (WULF) all logged over 10% declines.

In comparison, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 only saw modest declines, underscoring the crypto-specific weakness.

As the U.S. government continues to ramp up following its long closure, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release employment reports this week for both October and November. The data will be closely watched to help determine whether or not the Federal Reserve continues cutting interest rates in early 2026.

The Bank of Japan, meanwhile, is expected to hike its benchmark interest rate for the first time in nearly one year.

The Bank of England and the European Central Bank are also meeting later this week to discuss monetary policy.

IREN has dropped 47% from its 52-week high on Nov. 5, significantly underperforming mining and high-performance computing (HPC) peers, but  investment bank B. Riley said it's keeping its buy rating and a $74 price target in a Monday report.

Miners are down about 25% on average over the same period, and GPU cloud names CoreWeave (CRWV) and Nebius (NBIS), are off 31% and 25%, respectively, the report, by analysts Nick Giles and Fedor Shabalin, noted.

The two framed IREN's recent price moves as a sentiment-driven reset in a volatile AI proxy rather than a break in fundamentals.

The stock was 8.2% lower in early trading, at $36.82.

The analysts flagged the stock's volatility in recent weeks. IREN has also moved sharply in the other direction, rallying 47% between Oct. 22 and Nov. 5 versus roughly 13% for its HPC peer group over the same stretch, while CoreWeave fell 6% and Nebius gained 19%. 

The analysts argued this pattern shows the stock tends to overshoot both ways and that AI-driven drawdowns can offer entry points for investors willing to live with sector volatility.

On funding, IREN faces roughly a $2.7 billion gap between available capital and about $11.6 billion in planned HPC capex, including around $900 million for 23,000 GPUs at Prince George, $1.85 billion for 40,000 GPUs at Mackenzie and Canal Flats and $8.8 billion for 76,000 GPUs tied to Microsoft at the Childress campus, the analysts noted.

The bank tallies about $8.85 billion in capital already lined up, including Microsoft's 20% prepayment of $1.94 billion, an estimated $2.5 billion of financing for 76,000 GB300 GPUs related to the Microsoft deal, and roughly $1 billion in cash and equivalents.

The report also highlighted recent balance sheet moves, including roughly $2.3 billion in new convertible senior notes due 2032 and 2033, alongside prior 2029 and 2031 issues. 

The bank said net proceeds of about $2.27 billion from the latest convert deal funded a $201 million capped call with an initial cap price of $82.24 per share and the repurchase of about $227.7 million of 2030 notes and $316.6 million of 2029 notes for a combined purchase price of roughly $1.63 billion, including interest. In addition, the company's Dec. 2 registered direct offering of 39.7 million ordinary shares at $41.12 per share, completed Dec. 8, further strengthens the miner's capital stack.

Taken together, B. Riley characterizes the 47% pullback in IREN as a function of weak AI sentiment in a highly cyclical corner of the market, not a structural shift in the Microsoft-centric GPU build-out. The bank said the recent slide gives investors a chance to accumulate IREN ahead of a potential rebound in AI enthusiasm and continued progress on its HPC expansion.

These Hummingbirds Joust Like Medieval Knights—Even to the Death

The sharp, elongated bills of green hermit hummingbirds aren't just fine-tuned for feeding; they also allow males to joust like knights over mates

The iridescent green hermit hummingbird is known for its elongated bill, which is fine-tuned for feasting on a particular tropical flower in the rainforests of Central and South America.

But once mating season begins, its distinctive needle-pointed bill also becomes a weapon of war. According to new research published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, male green hermit hummingbirds use their bill—which is straighter and sharper than females'—to joust in a sparring match that can sometimes end in death.

“We used to think that males and females had different bill curvature because they feed on different flowers, but now we see that the evolutionary purpose that shapes their beaks is also about fighting,” says lead study author Alejandro Rico-Guevara, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Washington.

Using three-dimensional modeling of the bills of museum specimens, the researchers showed that the males bill is 3 percent straighter and 69 percent more pointed than the females', and the former has a dagger-tipped end that can strike at competition with surprising ferocity, Rico-Guevara says.

Hummingbirds from a species related to green hermit hummingbirds fighting in a similar way.

During breeding season in early May, the male birds gather in a group called a lek, where they begin singing a yippy chirp that tells breeding females to come hither. They fight for a position in the lek because males who are not part of the chorus are less likely to be heard by females. And if another hummingbird tries to perch on a branch that's already occupied, the fight can escalate. “The birds fly bill-first at the other bird and poke them with their entire force,” Rico-Guevara says.

Marcelo Araya-Salas, a biologist studying hermit hummingbirds at the University of Costa Rica, who was not involved in the study, says that this research does an elegant job of showing the difference in the bills using 3D modeling but that the conduct of the birds isn't at all surprising.

“They're crazy aggressive,” he says, so much so that the term Huitzilopochtli which is the Aztec sun and war god, “is a hummingbird.”

A Hobbit Mystery Is Solved, 2025 Nears a Climate Record, and Refusal of Vitamin K for Newborns

This week's science roundup covers 2025's near-record heat, a new mpox strain and fresh clues about why hobbits vanished 50,000 years ago.

Kendra Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman. You're listening to our weekly science news roundup.

First up, the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service reported last Monday that 2025 is shaping up to be the second-hottest year on record, with data suggesting it will tie with 2023 for runner-up status. To learn more about what this means, we are talking to Andrea Thompson, senior desk editor for life science here at Scientific American.

Hi, Andrea.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Andrea Thompson: Hi, Kendra.

Pierre-Louis: Thanks for joining us today. So yeah, can you tell me more about what the European climate agency found?

Thompson: Yeah, so the agency looked at global average temperature through the end of November for the year and found that we're at about 1.48 degrees Celsius above preindustrial, which is roughly the last half of the 19th century. And that puts us right now tied with second place for 2023 in terms of where we rank in the hottest years on record. The record holder is, of course, last year, 2024, which was the first year to breach 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Pierre-Louis: And why does that 1.5 degree Celsius number matter?

Thompson: So that is the number that the Parish climate agreement, which was negotiated in 2015, 10 years ago, sort of set as an ambitious goal. So the overall goal was to keep temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius ...

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Thompson: Above preindustrial but to aim for under 1.5 degrees Celsius. So this was the first year that hit above that level.

Now, it doesn't mean we have fully breached the Paris agreement accord ...

Pierre-Louis: Right.

Thompson: Because that looks over the average of many years; this is just one year.

Pierre-Louis: And why does that number—kind of zooming out a little bit more generally—like, why does it matter that the Earth is warming up this much? Should we be concerned?

Thompson: We should absolutely be concerned. We can already see the effects of climate change in the weather.

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Thompson: We experience climate disasters. It is probably most easily discernible in heat waves: We experience them more frequently. They're hotter. They last longer than they used to. But it shows up in a lot of different climate extremes in terms of flooding, drought, wildfires, and the sort of fingerprints of climate change are becoming increasingly clear in all of those kinds of disasters.

And of course, it has a lot of other impacts, too. It affects agriculture. It is affecting ecosystems in ways that come back to humans and everything from, you know, fisheries—whether a fishery collapses because fish have moved away to more climate waters—to whether our infrastructure can handle the climate it's sort of facing now when it was built for a climate that doesn't exist anymore.

Pierre-Louis: When they made this announcement, was there anything in particular that they noted or anything that they wanted to, like, call out that the average person should be aware of?

Thompson: Yeah, so I mean, there are a couple other things. The 10 hottest years on record have all happened basically in the last decade, and pretty much all of the hottest years are in this century, so it shows how much climate change has made a difference in the global average temperature but then what we're all experiencing every day. We will likely have the first three-year average above 1.5 degrees C, so that is sort of moving towards where we're going to breach the Paris climate agreement.

I think a lot of agencies always note this when they put out these temperature records, that the—whether we continue to break these records and by how much is entirely a matter of the path we choose. So the more we rein in greenhouse gas emissions, mainly by stopping burning fossil fuels, you know, the less likely we'll continue to break these records by larger and larger amounts.

Pierre-Louis: Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today.

Thompson: Thanks for having me.

Pierre-Louis: In other news, the U.K. Health Security Agency says it has detected a new strain of mpox in an individual who had recently traveled abroad. The virus spreads from close physical contact with an infected person, has two types, or clades. Clade I is endemic to Central Africa and has historically been deadlier. The typically less severe Clade II is endemic to West Africa. The clades are further broken down into smaller subtypes: clade IA and IB and clade IIA and IIB. Clade IIB is driving the current global outbreak that began in 2022 and has led to nearly 170,000 cases of mpox through October of this year, according to data from the World Health Organization. WHO reports there have been nearly 48,000 confirmed cases of mpox globally in 2025 so far.

The new strain identified in England contains elements of clade IIB and clade IB. The latter has recently shown some signs of local transmission in parts of Europe and the U.S., according to U.K. health officials. Researchers don't yet know what impact the new strain could have on transmission. The BBC also reported that it's unclear how effectively the existing vaccine will provide protection. The vaccine is currently about 75 to 80 percent effective at preventing mpox infection.

Speaking of public health, a study published last Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that between 2017 and 2024 the proportion of newborns who didn't receive a vitamin K injection increased by nearly 80 percent. The number of newborns not getting the shot went from roughly 3 percent to more than 5 percent.

Vitamin K is necessary for blood clotting, but newborns have naturally low levels of the nutrient. Skipping the injection means up to one in every 60 babies are at risk of developing vitamin K deficiency bleeding. It can lead to permanent brain damage or even death, according to SciAm's reporting on the research. Since the 1960s the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that babies receive a vitamin K injection at birth to reduce this risk. The injection has been seen as a neonatal success story.

Research into vitamin K refusal by Jaspreet Loyal, a doctor at the Yale New Haven Children's Hospital who was not involved in the study, offered some insight as to why some parents may refuse the shot. She told SciAm her research found these parents may have the misperception that the risks are greater than the benefits or may want to go a more “natural” route when it comes to child-rearing. Some online influencers have suggested giving babies oral vitamin K instead of the injection, but the oral version is not as readily absorbed, and the shot bears negligible risks.

And now on to a hobbit mystery. At the center of the story lies an early human relative called Homo floresiensis. The species's tiny stature led scientists to nickname them hobbits, after the fictional beings we all know and love. They even lived in their own version of a hobbit hole, taking up residence for some 140,000 years in a cave called Liang Bua on an island in Indonesia. But around 50,000 years ago they simply vanished.

Research published last Monday in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment may finally shed some light on why. The scientists reconstructed past climate and rainfall conditions using stalagmites from the cave. This led the researchers to conclude that around the time Homo floresiensis disappeared, a severe drought took hold, causing summer rainfall to decline and riverbeds to become seasonally dry. The researchers also conducted analysis on fossilized teeth from pygmy elephants, which were an important food source for the hobbits. They found that these creatures relied on river water to survive. As the climate became drier the number of pygmy elephants declined and the hobbits were left with less to eat. No second breakfasts, no elevenses, no luncheons or afternoon teas. The scientists concluded that the diminishing resources likely forced the hobbits to abandon Liang Bua.

What happened after the hobbits decamped from the cave is still shrouded in mystery. But Mike Gagan, lead author of the study and an honorary professor at the University of Wollongong in Australia, said in a statement, “It's possible that as the hobbits moved in search of water and prey, they encountered modern humans. In that sense, climate change may have set the stage for their final disappearance.”

That's all for today's episode. Tune in on Wednesday, when we talk with SciAm senior multimedia editor Kelso Harper, who spent the summer stalking orcas in the Pacific Northwest.

Because they rely on hosts for a majority of functions, viruses aren't considered alive. But entities like this one complicate matters.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

At first glance, creating a definition for “life” seems somewhat straightforward. Sentient animals all the way down to single-celled organisms capable of reproduction are welcome on the tree of life, but there are other organisms that challenge this understanding, like viruses. Because virus don't grow, reproduce on their own, or make their own energy, they're typically excluded from definitions of life. 

But once a virus infects a potential host, it's immensely active, and can be responsible for world-altering events (see: Spanish flu, ebola, COVID-19, and so on). 

However, life is complicated, and this controversial categorization of “life” and “not life” can have gray areas in which organisms appear to defy the expectations of both camps. Recently, scientists found a new creature perched right on the edge of the “life” category. 

In a paper published on the bioRxiv server, researchers in Canada and Japan outlined how they identified a new cellular entity that appeared to challenge aspects of the typical definitions of cellular life. 

Currently named ‘Sukunaarchaeum mirabile' (after a deity in Japanese mythology known for its small stature), this entity—which the research team has concluded is a form of life—contains the necessary genes to create its own ribosomes and messenger RNA, something your typical virus lacks. But like a virus, it offloads certain biological functions onto its potential host and it appears singularly obsessed with replicating itself.

“Its genome is profoundly stripped-down, lacking virtually all recognizable metabolic pathways, and primarily encoding the machinery for its replicative core: DNA replication, transcription, and translation,” the authors wrote. “This suggests an unprecedented level of metabolic dependence on a host, a condition that challenges the functional distinctions between minimal cellular life and viruses.”

Led by Ryo Harada, a molecular biologist from Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the team chanced upon this strange creature while studying the bacterial genome of the marine plankton Citharistes regius. Within the genomic data, Harada and his team found a loop of DNA that didn't match with any known species. They eventually determined that the organism belonged to the domain Archaea—a group associated with prokaryotic cells, but from which eukaryotic cells (i.e. you and me) ultimately descended a couple billion years ago. 

Perhaps the most remarkable feature of Sukunaarchaeum is its extreme genome reduction, with only 238,000 base pairs of DNA. Viruses, as Live Science points out, can contain many hundreds of thousands more base pairs, and can even reach up into the millions. As for fellow archaea, the smallest known complete genome within this group stretches to 490,000 base pairs, meaning that Sukunaarchaeum contains less than half the number of base pairs posessed by even the smallest archaeal genome. 

“The discovery of Sukunaarchaeum pushes the conventional boundaries of cellular life and highlights the vast unexplored biological novelty within microbial interactions,” the authors wrote. “Further exploration of symbiotic systems may reveal even more extraordinary life forms, reshaping our understanding of cellular evolution.”

Scientists have pushed back LUCA's origin by hundreds of millions of years.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Life on Earth had to begin somewhere, and scientists think that “somewhere” is LUCA—or the Last Universal Common Ancestor. True to its name, this prokaryote-like organism represents the ancestor of every living thing, from the tiniest of bacteria to the grandest of blue whales. 

While the Cambrian Explosion kickstarted complex life in a major way some 530 million years, the true timeline of life on Earth is much longer. For years, scientists have estimated that LUCA likely arrived on the scene some 4 billion years, which is only 600 million years after the planet's formation. 

But a study from an international team of scientists pushes that timeline back even further to some 4.2 billion years ago, while also discovering some fascinating details about what life for LUCA might've been like. The results of the study were published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. 

The paper reads:

To zero in on exactly when LUCA appeared on Earth, scientists had to work backward. First, the team compared genes in living species and counted the mutations that have occurred since sharing a common ancestor with LUCA. Using a genetic equation based on the time of separation between species, the team worked out that LUCA must've been mucking around on Earth as early as 400 million years after its creation, which puts this organism smack in the middle of the hellish geologic nightmare known as the Hadean Eon. 

“The evolutionary history of genes is complicated by their exchange between lineages,” University of Bristol's Edmund Moody, the lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “We have to use complex evolutionary models to reconcile the evolutionary history of genes with the genealogy of species.”

Not satisfied with just learning its age, the team took things a step further and retraced the physiological characteristics of living species to understand what LUCA must've been like 4.2 billion years ago—and the results gave some surprising answers. The scientists estimate that while LUCA was a simple prokaryote, it likely had an immune system, meaning it was already fighting off primordial viruses. 

“It's clear that LUCA was exploiting and changing its environment, but it is unlikely to have lived alone,” University of Exeter's Tim Lenton, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “Its waste would have been food for other microbes, like methanogens, that would have helped to create a recycling ecosystem.”

While LUCA is the oldest common ancestor we know of, scientists still don't understand how life evolved from its very origins to the early communities of which LUCA is a part. Further studies will need to dive deeper into this primordial history and uncover exactly how you, me, and every other living thing, came to be.

A digital architectural reconstruction has researchers believing a “lost Pompeii” existed with towers atop villas.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A monumental staircase at Pompeii's House of Thiasus villa seemingly led nowhere. That nowhere turned into something special when researchers looked up. They've since determined that a “lost Pompeii” could once be found in now-destroyed towers rising above the ancient city's most elite villas. 

“Lost Pompeii” consists of the upper floors of buildings which are essential to understanding life in the ancient city,” Gabriel Zuchtriegal, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, said in a statement. A research team employed digital archaeology to create models of villas of the super-rich, showing that Pompeii's largest villas likely once had towers, true symbols of power and wealth. 

The researchers from Berlin's Humboldt University and the Archaeological Park of Pompeii were most fascinated by the House of Thiasus, known for its banquet hall lined with frescoes. The villa, though, also features a monstrous staircase that seemingly leads nowhere. What if, instead of focusing on the ground floor, the researchers looked up? 

In a new article on the reconstructions of the tower of the House of Thiasus published in the E-journal Scavi di Pompei, researchers resurrected a lost Pompeii using digital archaeology to approximate what could have been present before the devastating Mount Vesuvius volcano of 79 C.E. destroyed the city. 

The team believes the onslaught of ash buried and preserved the buildings' lowest levels but brought destruction to the upper floors. 

By scanning existing structures, the team designed digital replicas. Using clues, such as unconnected staircases and cut-off support beams, the team digitally designed architectural elements they believe previously existed. The team posits that the staircase led to a tower so that the wealthy could view the city and the Bay of Naples, along with the night sky.  

The researchers believe the House of Thiasus could have featured a 40-foot-tall tower consisting of multiple stories. “The interior of the lower part was simple in its furnishing,” the researchers wrote, according to translation. “This contrasted by the monumental external staircase that leads to the upper floor, suggesting a living space of a more elegant and representative character.” 

The journal features the digital architecture, which utilizes 3D modeling to reconstruct what could have been in place. “In particular, ‘lost Pompeii' consists of the upper floors of buildings which are essential to understanding life in the ancient city,” the researchers wrote. “By putting together the data in the form of a 3D digital model, we can develop hypothetical reconstructions that help us to understand the experience, the spaces, and the society of the time.” 

In an ancient city famous for what survived the horrific volcanic eruption, this digital approach demonstrates one way archaeologists can focus instead on what does not remain in the aftermath. “Archaeological research at Pompeii is extremely complex,” Zuchtriegal said. “As well as research carried out in the field with excavations that reveal well-preserved contexts providing insights into life in antiquity and new stories about the tragic eruption, another approach involves non-invasive research, based on studies and hypothetical reconstructions of what has not been preserved, but which adds to our knowledge of the site.”

The sea remains home to many strange wonders yet to be discovered.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

One of the greatest questions in science is if there is alien life among the stars. But for centuries, scientists have already been identifying creatures in our oceans that continually challenge our perception of life. Of all the strange animal families that fills our oceans (and trust us, there are a lot), jellyfish just might be one of the weirdest ones. They're brainless, boneless, heartless, and a few of them can functionally live forever. When it comes to the kingdom Animalia, not many feel as alien as these majestic-yet-perplexing creatures. 

And somehow, a recent study in the journal Zoological Studies found that this Cnidarian-shaped rabbit hole of strangeness actually goes even deeper, as scientists at the Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) discovered a new species of box jellyfish in brackish ponds (known as “gei wais”) at the nearby Mai Po Nature Reserve. Part of the Tripedaliidae family in the class Cubozoa, this new species named Tripedalia maipoensis is cube-shaped like other box jellyfish (hence the class name), and is both the third species found in the genus Tripedalia and the first ever found in Chinese waters. 

The team initially found the new species in 2020, and then found them every subsequent year in the shrimp ponds at the reserve. Despite the new species' hyper-specific name, scientists think that this species isn't only found in the reserve, which the World Wildlife Federation describes as a “paradise for birds and a beautiful, irreplaceable piece of China's wetland kaleidoscope.”

“We named the new species Tripedalia maipoensis to reflect its type locality—where the new species was first found,” Qiu Jianwen, a biologist and co-author from HKBU, said in a press statement. “Although it is currently known only in Mai Po, we believe that this species is also distributed in the adjacent waters of the Pearl River Estuary as the gei wais are connected to the estuary through a tidal channel.”

Box jellyfish aren't exactly massive monsters of the sea. While the Australian box jellyfish Chironex fleckeri sports a bell that stretches one foot across (and is one of the most venomous creatures in the world), others are relative pipsqueaks by comparison, with bells barely breaking one centimeter in diameter. T. maipoensis is more like the latter, with an average body length of 1.5 centimeters. And like other box jellyfish, members of this new species also boast one of the strangest attributes in all the animal kingdom—they have 24 eyes. 

But not all of these eyes are created equal. According to the researchers, these eyes are split into four groups of six, which are each located inside a sensory organ known as a rhopalium. Of those six eyes, two of them have lenses for forming images and the other four detect light and dark. Earth.com reports that another member of the genus Tripedalia (known as T. cystophora, native to the Caribbean and the Central Indo-Pacific) used its upward-facing eyes to stay hidden in the mangrove canopy while maintaining the awareness needed to navigate the tree's root system. This eye system essentially gives these box jellyfish 360-degree vision.

Because the reserve is located near a bay that empties into the South China Sea, scientists are eager to survey the country's coast to learn the full extent of this new box jellyfish's range.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Mayo Clinic neurosurgeon reveals 8 back pain myths to stop believing","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251214100940.htm","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 07:23:53 GMT","

Back pain affects many people, yet a surprising number of misunderstandings continue to circulate. Meghan Murphy, M.D., a neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato, reviews eight common beliefs and explains what research and clinical experience actually show.

Myth: Lifting heavy objects is the main cause of back pain.

Fact: Lifting heavy objects with poor form can contribute to back pain, but the major culprits are a sedentary lifestyle, poor posture, obesity and genetic factors.

Myth: Bed rest will make my back pain better.

Fact: Probably not, but it depends on the cause of your pain. If it's muscle strain, taking it easy for a few days may help. However, bed rest can also make back pain last longer or even worsen. If your pain is from nerve compression, a disc issue or joint degeneration, inactivity can cause muscles to tighten, pain to worsen, loss of physical condition and more debility. In these cases, you should modify your activities, switch to low-impact exercises like walking and swimming, and avoid movements like bending, twisting or lifting. Maintaining some degree of physical activity can help you heal faster.

Myth: Back pain is caused by sitting on a fat wallet. 

Fact: Sitting with a large wallet in your back pocket can cause leg or hip pain and numbness, but typically not back pain. A large wallet can tilt your pelvis and compress your sciatic nerve. This nerve is the largest in your body, branching from the lower back through your hips, buttocks and down each leg. Compressing it causes pain or numbness while sitting or driving. After sitting for a long time, you may find walking difficult or feel pins and needles in your legs.

First, try removing the wallet and taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications. If the leg pain persists, check with a healthcare professional.

Myth: Back pain is always due to a serious underlying condition. 

Fact: Back pain is usually caused by muscle strains or sprains, not by a serious condition like a disc or vertebrae issue. Most back pain resolves on its own.

Myth: Avoid exercise when experiencing back pain.

Fact: Exercise and physical activity are usually recommended for managing and preventing back pain. Strengthening the core muscles, including your back muscles, improving flexibility, and maintaining a healthy weight can contribute to a healthier back. Depending on your pain, you may need to modify your activity. You know your body best, so listen to it. If something isn't getting better or grows progressively worse, contact a healthcare professional for an evaluation.

Myth: Surgery is the only solution for chronic back pain.

Fact: Back pain is often caused by issues that aren't relieved with surgery. Non-surgical treatments like physical therapy, medications, injections and lifestyle modifications are often effective in managing and reducing chronic back pain. Surgery may be necessary if your pain:

Seek an immediate medical evaluation if you experience any of these symptoms.

Myth: A firm mattress is the best for alleviating back pain.

Fact: The ideal mattress firmness varies from person to person. Some people may find relief with a firm mattress, while others may prefer a medium or soft one. When shopping for a new mattress, look for one that provides support and comfort based on your preferences and needs.

Myth: Poor posture doesn't contribute to back pain.

Fact: Many people spend hours slouching while staring at a computer or focusing on cellphones that draw the eyes down and curve the neck. These habits can strain muscles and joints, causing body pain over time. Practice good posture habits and take advantage of ergonomic office equipment to help prevent and alleviate back pain.

Some back problems are unavoidable because they are linked to injuries, arthritis or genetics. However, several strategies can support long-term back health:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Researchers identify viral suspects that could be fueling long COVID","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251214100911.htm","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 03:38:33 GMT","

For many people living with long COVID, ongoing issues such as breathlessness, fatigue and brain fog remain difficult to explain. A team of prominent microbiologists now believes they may have uncovered an important clue.

Their view is that, for some individuals, long COVID symptoms could stem from additional infections that occur alongside SARS-CoV-2.

A review published in eLife by 17 experts, including researchers at Rutgers Health, suggests that co-infections acquired before or during a bout of COVID may help drive long-lasting symptoms.

""This is an aspect of long COVID that is not talked about a lot,"" said Maria Laura Gennaro, a microbiologist at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School who chaired the Microbiology Task Force for the National Institutes of Health's Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery initiative, a large-scale study of long COVID.

Growing Evidence That Other Pathogens May Play a Role

Long COVID has affected up to 400 million people worldwide and can cause problems ranging from mild disruption to severe disability. It can involve the brain, heart, lungs and digestive system. Despite its widespread impact, no proven treatments exist because the underlying cause remains unclear.

The new review brings together existing scientific findings and expert opinion to highlight an idea that has received relatively little attention: infections other than the coronavirus itself may be important contributors.

EBV Reactivation as a Leading Suspect

One of the strongest lines of evidence centers on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the virus that causes mononucleosis. Roughly 95 percent of adults carry EBV in a latent form that usually remains silent until an immune challenge such as COVID triggers its reactivation.

In one early study, researchers reported that two-thirds of people with long COVID showed markers of recent EBV activity, and those with more symptoms had higher antibody levels. Subsequent studies also linked EBV reactivation with well known features of long COVID, including fatigue and cognitive difficulties.

TB and Immune Disruption

Another pathogen receiving attention is tuberculosis (TB). About one-quarter of the global population carries latent TB. Evidence indicates that COVID may reduce the immune cells that normally contain TB, raising the risk that it could reactivate. The connection may also work in the opposite direction, since TB appears capable of worsening COVID outcomes.

The researchers emphasize that timing is important. Infections that occur before COVID may weaken the immune system. Infections during the initial illness may intensify tissue damage. Infections that arise after recovery could take advantage of lingering immune dysfunction caused by COVID.

Rising Rates of Other Diseases and the Idea of Immunity Theft

According to the authors, 44 countries have seen tenfold increases in at least 13 infectious diseases compared with levels observed before the pandemic. One idea they discuss, known as ""immunity theft,"" proposes that an episode of acute COVID may leave people more susceptible to other infections.

If co-infections truly contribute to long COVID, treatments already available could potentially help. Existing antibiotics and antivirals might be repurposed to target specific underlying infections, and clinical trials could examine whether treating these infections improves long COVID symptoms.

A Hypothesis That Still Requires Proof

The researchers caution that their argument remains preliminary. Although the connections they outline are biologically reasonable, they are still unproven. No causal relationship has been confirmed between any co-infection and long COVID.

""Everyone has heard it a million times, but it bears repeating: Correlation doesn't equal causation,"" Gennaro said.

She added that verifying the hypothesis would require large epidemiological studies and animal research, yet this work is made more difficult by the lack of reliable animal models for long COVID.

Expanding the Search for Answers

The authors hope their findings will encourage more investigation into how co-infections might shape long COVID. While the review does not provide immediate solutions for those currently dealing with long-term symptoms, the researchers suggest that effective treatment may involve looking beyond the coronavirus alone.

The geometry of space itself may play a far more central role in physics than previously thought. Instead of serving only as the backdrop where forces act, spacetime may be responsible for the forces and particles that make up the universe.

New theoretical work suggests that the fundamental behavior of nature could arise directly from the structure of spacetime, pointing to geometry as the common origin of physical interactions.

Hidden Dimensions and Seven-Dimensional Geometry

In a paper published in Nuclear Physics B, physicist Richard Pincak and collaborators examine whether the properties of matter and forces can emerge from the geometry of unseen dimensions beyond everyday space.

Their research proposes that the universe includes additional dimensions that are not directly observable. These dimensions may be compact and folded into complex seven-dimensional shapes called G2-manifolds. Until now, such geometric structures were typically treated as fixed and unchanging. The new study instead explores what happens when these shapes are allowed to evolve over time through a mathematical process known as the G2-Ricci flow, which gradually alters their internal geometry.

Twisting Geometry and Stable Structures

""As in organic systems, such as the twisting of DNA or the handedness of amino acids, these extra-dimensional structures can possess torsion, a kind of intrinsic twist,"" explains Pincak. This torsion introduces a built-in rotation within the geometry itself.

When the researchers modeled how these twisted shapes change over time, they found that the geometry can naturally settle into stable patterns called solitons. ""When we let them evolve in time, we find that they can settle into stable configurations called solitons. These solitons could provide a purely geometric explanation of phenomena such as spontaneous symmetry breaking.""

Rethinking the Origin of Mass

In the Standard Model of particle physics, mass arises through interactions with the Higgs field, which gives weight to particles such as the W and Z bosons. The new theory suggests a different possibility. Instead of relying on a separate field, mass may result from torsion within extra-dimensional geometry itself.

""In our picture,"" Pincak says, ""matter emerges from the resistance of geometry itself, not from an external field."" In this view, mass reflects how spacetime responds to its own internal structure rather than the influence of an added physical ingredient.

Cosmic Expansion and a Possible New Particle

The researchers also connect geometric torsion to the curvature of spacetime on large scales. This relationship could help explain the positive cosmological constant associated with the accelerating expansion of the universe.

Beyond these cosmological implications, the team speculates about the existence of a previously unknown particle linked to torsion, which they call the ""Torstone."" If real, it could potentially be detected in future experiments.

Extending Einstein's Geometric Vision

The broader ambition of the work is to push Einstein's idea further. If gravity arises from geometry, the authors ask whether all fundamental forces might share the same origin. As Pincak puts it, ""Nature often prefers simple solutions. Perhaps the masses of the W and Z bosons come not from the famous Higgs field, but directly from the geometry of seven-dimensional space.""

The article published in the journal Nuclear Physics B.

The research was supported by R3 project No.09I03-03-V04-00356.

Some plants lack both green pigments and sexual reproduction, yet these unusual traits reveal important insights into what defines plant life. A new study involving Kobe University examined species in the genus Balanophora to understand how non-green, asexual plants develop and survive.

""My long-standing aim is to rethink what it truly means to be a plant,"" says Kobe University botanist Kenji Suetsugu. He continues, ""For many years I have been fascinated by plants that have abandoned photosynthesis, and I want to uncover the changes that occur in the process."" Balanophora species represent an extreme case because they do not photosynthesize and instead draw nutrients from the roots of host plants. They remain underground for most of their lives and appear above the soil only during flowering season, and some species reproduce only through asexual means. ""However, while there have been individual studies on changes in the plants' genomes, their ecology and their reproduction, we don't know how they relate to each other,"" explains Suetsugu.

Linking Evolution, Plastids, and Ecology in Balanophora

To address this gap, Suetsugu set out to unify three areas of research that had never been examined together for Balanophora. He aimed to clarify the relationships among species, investigate how their plastids have been altered (a part of a plant's cells which in green plants serves as the cell's ""solar panels""), and determine how their reproductive strategies fit within their ecological context. Describing the difficulty of the work, he says: ""These plants are rare, patchy and often restricted to steep, humid forests. But years of experience with studying Balanophora both in the lab and in field studies, as well as long-standing relationships with local naturalists made this project possible."" To expand the project, he collaborated with experts at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology who specialize in highly reduced genomes.

Extreme Plastid Reduction Suggests a Shared Ancestral Shift

The study, now published in the journal New Phytologist, reports that all members of the group possess a dramatically reduced plastid genome (DNA not kept in the plant cell's nucleus but directly in the plastid). The team concluded that this reduction likely occurred in a common ancestor before the lineage split into multiple species. Suetsugu says: ""It is exciting to see how far a plant can reduce its plastid genome, which at first glance looks as though the plastid is on the verge of disappearing. But looking more closely we found that many proteins are still transported to the plastid, showing that even though the plant has abandoned photosynthesis, the plastid is still a vital part of the plant's metabolism.""

Repeated Evolution of Asexual Reproduction Across the Region

The researchers also determined that asexual reproduction probably emerged several times within the group. Their findings suggest that the plants may have developed the capacity to produce seeds without fertilization early on, which would have helped them colonize the chain of islands extending from mainland Japan through Okinawa to Taiwan. ""Over the past decade I have studied Balanophora pollination and seed dispersal where camel crickets and cockroaches play an unexpected role, but I also noticed that asexual seed production often ensured reproduction when mates or pollinators are scarce,"" explains Suetsugu. In some species, this reproductive approach may have become the primary mode of producing offspring.

Understanding How Parasitic, Non-Photosynthetic Plants Persist

For Suetsugu, the work represents a major step toward understanding how plants that no longer perform photosynthesis continue to function and survive in natural environments. Suetsugu says, ""For someone who has spent many hours observing these plants in dark, humid forests, seeing their story unfold at the genomic level is deeply satisfying. My next goal is to connect these results with biochemical measurements to find out what Balanophora plastids actually produce and how these products help sustain the parasitic plants' growth within the roots of their hosts.""

This research was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (grant 23K14256), the Human Frontier Science Program (grant RGEC29/2024), the Japan Science and Technology Agency (grants JPMJPR21D6, JPMJFR2339) and the National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan (grant 109-2311-B-845-001). It was conducted in collaboration with researchers from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology and the University of Taipei.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Why consciousness exists at all","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251215084209.htm","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 15:31:35 GMT","

Our everyday lives are shaped by conscious experience. At times, this experience is pleasant, such as feeling sunlight on your skin, hearing birds sing, or simply enjoying a peaceful moment. At other times, it is painful, whether from a physical injury like hurting your knee on the stairs or from ongoing emotional struggles such as chronic pessimism. This raises a fundamental question: why did living beings evolve a form of perception that includes pleasure, pain, and even intense suffering?

Albert Newen and Carlos Montemayor describe consciousness as having three distinct forms, each serving a different role: 1. basic arousal, 2. general alertness, and 3. a reflexive (self-)consciousness. According to Newen, basic arousal was the first to emerge in evolutionary history. ""Evolutionarily, basic arousal developed first, with the base function of putting the body in a state of ALARM in life-threatening situations so that the organism can stay alive,"" he explains. Pain plays a crucial role here. ""Pain is an extremely efficient means for perceiving damage to the body and to indicate the associated threat to its continued life. This often triggers a survival response, such as fleeing or freezing.""

How Attention and Learning Evolved

A later evolutionary development is general alertness. This form of consciousness allows an individual to focus on one important signal while filtering out others. For example, if someone is talking to you and you suddenly notice smoke, your attention shifts immediately to the smoke as you look for its source. As Carlos Montemayor explains, ""This makes it possible to learn about new correlations: first the simple, causal correlation that smoke comes from fire and shows where a fire is located. But targeted alertness also lets us identify complex, scientific correlations.""

Self Awareness and Social Life

Humans and some other animals go a step further by developing reflexive (self-)consciousness. In its more advanced form, this ability allows individuals to think about themselves, remember the past, and anticipate the future. It also makes it possible to build a mental image of oneself and use that image to guide decisions and plans. Newen notes, ""Reflexive consciousness, in its simple forms, developed parallel to the two basic forms of consciousness. In such cases conscious experience focuses not on perceiving the environment, but rather on the conscious registration of aspects of oneself."" These aspects include bodily states, perceptions, sensations, thoughts, and actions.

A simple example of reflexive consciousness is recognizing oneself in a mirror. Human children usually develop this ability around 18 months of age. It has also been observed in certain animals, including chimpanzees, dolphins, and magpies. At its core, reflexive conscious experience supports social integration and coordination with others, helping individuals function within groups.

What Birds Perceive

Research by Gianmarco Maldarelli and Onur Güntürkün suggests that birds may also possess basic forms of conscious perception. Their work highlights three main areas where birds show strong similarities to mammals: sensory consciousness, underlying brain structures, and forms of self-consciousness.

Evidence of Sensory Experience in Birds

Studies of sensory consciousness show that birds do more than automatically react to stimuli. They appear to have subjective experiences. When pigeons are shown visually ambiguous images, they alternate between different interpretations, much like humans do. Research on crows provides further evidence. Certain nerve signals in their brains reflect what the animal perceives rather than the physical stimulus itself. When a crow sometimes consciously detects a stimulus and sometimes does not, specific nerve cells respond in line with that internal experience.

Bird Brains and Conscious Processing

Bird brains also contain structures that support conscious processing, even though their anatomy differs from that of mammals. Güntürkün explains, ""The avian equivalent to the prefrontal cortex, the NCL, is immensely connected and allows the brain to integrate and flexibly process information."" He adds, ""The connectome of the avian forebrain, which presents the entirety of the flows of information between the regions of the brain, shares many similarities with mammals. Birds thus meet many criteria of established theories of consciousness, such as the Global Neuronal Workspace theory.""

Signs of Self Perception in Birds

More recent experiments indicate that birds may also show forms of self-perception. While some corvid species pass the classic mirror test, other studies use alternative approaches that better reflect birds' natural behaviors. These experiments reveal additional forms of self-consciousness in different species. Güntürkün notes, ""Experiments indicate that pigeons and chickens differentiate between their reflection in a mirror and a real fellow member of their species, and react to these according to context. This is a sign of situational, basic self-consciousness.""

Taken together, these findings suggest that consciousness did not emerge recently or exclusively in humans. Instead, it appears to be an ancient and widespread feature of evolution. Birds demonstrate that conscious processing can occur without a cerebral cortex and that very different brain structures can arrive at similar functional outcomes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Cannabis compounds show unexpected power against ovarian cancer","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251215025315.htm","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 08:24:03 GMT","

In the future, medications derived from cannabis may play a role in treating ovarian cancer. A research team examining two natural compounds found in cannabis discovered that both produced notable anti-cancer activity when tested on ovarian cancer cells. Although significant work is still needed before any patient-ready drug can be developed, the early results highlight a promising path toward new therapies for a cancer that is difficult to detect and even more challenging to manage.

""Ovarian cancer remains one of the deadliest gynecological malignancies, characterized by late diagnosis, high recurrence rates, and limited effective treatment options,"" said Dr. Siyao Tong of Khon Kaen University, lead author of the article in Frontiers in Pharmacology. ""Our goal is to find alternative drugs that can improve efficacy and potentially reduce toxicity, ultimately bringing new hope to patients facing this challenging disease.""

Why Current Treatments Fall Short

Of all gynecological cancers, ovarian cancer causes the highest number of deaths. Even with progress in medical care, available drugs often fail to produce long-lasting results and can cause severe side effects. Because new approaches are urgently needed, the researchers turned their attention to CBD (cannabidiol, which is not psychoactive) and THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, which is), two cannabis-derived compounds that have shown signs of anti-cancer activity in other diseases.

The team worked with two ovarian cancer cell lines, one responsive to platinum-based drugs and one resistant, and exposed them to CBD, THC, or a combination of both. They also tested the compounds on healthy cells to determine whether normal tissue would be harmed.

CBD and THC Significantly Reduce Cancer Cell Growth

Cancer cells treated with either CBD or THC formed fewer colonies, and those colonies were smaller than usual. Both compounds slowed the ability of cancer cells to reproduce, but the strongest effects appeared when CBD and THC were used together. Although neither compound alone killed large numbers of cancer cells, the combination proved highly effective. This suggests that the two chemicals may influence cancer cells through different mechanisms, and these mechanisms may reinforce one another.

""Notably, the inhibitory effect was most pronounced when CBD and THC were used in a 1:1 ratio,"" said Tong.

Additional experiments showed that the compounds reduced cancer cell migration, an important finding because metastasis is a major cause of death in ovarian cancer. A therapy that limits the spread of cancer could significantly improve patient outcomes.

Potential for Less Toxic Cancer Treatments

Both cell lines responded similarly, indicating that the compounds might work across multiple ovarian cancer types. The cannabis-derived treatments also caused little harm to healthy cells, suggesting that future therapies based on these compounds might be easier for patients to tolerate than many current options.

To better understand why the compounds were effective, the researchers analyzed cancer cell signaling. They found that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is often overactivated in ovarian cancer and contributes to tumor progression and drug resistance, appeared to return to more normal activity after treatment with CBD and THC. This restoration of control may explain the reduced growth and increased cell death observed in the experiments.

Next Steps and Remaining Challenges

Despite the encouraging results, the scientists emphasize that far more research is needed before CBD or THC can be considered viable treatment options for ovarian cancer. Additional studies must determine whether these compounds can be safely and effectively used in clinical settings.

""Although our study is still preliminary, it lays an important foundation for future research into the potential applications of CBD and THC in ovarian cancer treatment,"" said Tong. ""By confirming their anti-cancer activity and identifying key molecular mechanisms, our findings are expected to drive further preclinical research. If future studies confirm these effects, CBD-THC combination therapy may ultimately contribute to the development of new treatment strategies.""

""However, this study has some limitations,"" Tong added. ""All experiments were conducted in vitro, so the results may not fully reflect the complexity of tumor behavior in living organisms. We did not include in vivo models and pharmacokinetic data, which are crucial for determining whether CBD/THC can be safely and effectively used clinically. Finally, regulatory and legal issues surrounding cannabinoid therapy may also affect future translational research. While the results are encouraging, more studies are needed before these findings can be applied to patient treatment.""

During developmental processes such as embryogenesis, how a group of cells self-organizes into specific structures is a central question in biology. However, it remains a major challenge to understand and predict the behavior of every cell within the living tissue over time during such intricate processes. Here we present MultiCell, a geometric deep learning method that can accurately capture the highly convoluted interactions among cells. We demonstrate that multicellular data can be represented with both granular and foam-like physical pictures through a unified graph data structure, considering both cellular interactions and cell junction networks. Using this method, we achieve interpretable four-dimensional morphological sequence alignment and predict single-cell behaviors before they occur at single-cell resolution during Drosophila embryogenesis. Furthermore, using neural activation map and model ablation studies, we demonstrate that cell geometry and cell junction networks are essential features for predicting cell behaviors during morphogenesis. This method sets the stage for data-driven quantitative studies of dynamic multicellular developmental processes at single-cell precision, offering a proof-of-concept pathway toward a unified morphodynamic atlas.

Drug combinations are essential to modern medicine, but their discovery remains slow and inefficient as experimental complexity expands rapidly with each additional drug tested. Although modern liquid handling systems enable complex and highly customizable experimental designs, a lack of strategies integrating these technologies with combination-specific analytical methods has limited throughput. Here we introduce Combocat, an open-source and streamlined framework that combines acoustic liquid handling protocols with machine learning-based inference to achieve ultrahigh-throughput drug combination screening. Using Combocat, we generate a reference dataset of over 800 unique combinations in a dense 10 × 10 matrix format across multiple cell types, and use this to train a predictive model that accurately infers drug combination effects from sparse data, drastically reducing the number of experimental measurements required. As proof of concept, we screened 9,045 combinations in a neuroblastoma cell line—the largest number of combinations tested in a single cell line to date—achieved using minimal resources. By integrating advanced drug dispensing technologies with predictive computational modeling, Combocat provides a scalable solution to accelerate the discovery of novel drug combinations.

The development of effective drug combinations is fundamental to modern therapeutic strategies1,2,3,4, particularly for cancers5,6 and infectious diseases2,7,8,9 where single-agent therapies often fail to achieve sustained efficacy. Combining drugs can have a synergistic effect on drug efficacy, overcoming resistance mechanisms and reducing the toxicity of treatment by requiring lower individual doses of each drug10,11. Synergy, in this context, is defined as a combination effect that exceeds expectations based on individual drug activities under established models like Bliss independence12 (Fig. 1a).

a Practical representation of drug synergy, where the combined effect of two drugs exceeds the expected effect (“E”) based on models like additivity or Bliss independence. b Examples of traditional high-throughput screens employing small (e.g., 3 × 3), sparse, or asymmetric (e.g., 2 × 7) matrix formats, which limit dose density. c Combocat's streamlined approach for dense and reproducible drug combination screening. The 384-well plate format contains Drugs 1 and 2 (represented by upper and lower triangles, respectively), with concentrations shown ranging from low (blue) to high (red). Three replicate 10 × 10 combination matrices are generated for each drug pair, along with three replicates of each single-agent dose-response. Twelve replicates each of cell death (orange) and vehicle (yellow) controls are included for normalization. d Overview of the Combocat analytical pipeline. Raw data are mapped to corresponding combination matrices and subsequently normalized to percentage cell death using controls. Synergy is then quantified using the Bliss independence model. Results are summarized across the screen to identify top synergistic interactions.

Combination therapy is a promising frontier—but also a vast one whose comprehensive exploration has been limited by the sheer number of possible drug combinations10. With each additional agent tested, the number of total possible 2-drug combinations increases quadratically, making exhaustive experimental testing impractical. While large-scale single-agent screens have evaluated tens of thousands of compounds13,14,15, drug combination screens have remained constrained by technical and resource limitations, preventing them from achieving comparable scale. These constraints often force researchers to choose between the number of combinations tested and the number of concentrations measured per drug, or dose density. This tradeoff can prove problematic, as dense measurements across a broad range of concentrations are crucial for capturing the nuanced dose-response landscapes needed to reliably detect synergy patterns16. Consequently, some of the largest reported combination studies have adopted smaller17, sparser18, or asymmetric19,20 matrix formats (Fig. 1b). Advancements in robotic liquid handling technologies, such as acoustic dispensing, have revolutionized compound transfer, enabling more flexible and precise experimental designs. Acoustic liquid handlers can dispense nanoliter volumes from any well of a source plate to any well of a destination plate without physical contact, enhancing throughput and minimizing resource consumption. Despite the promise of these technological advances, their impact on drug combination screening has so far been limited by a lack of integrated experimental and analytical platforms that fully leverage their capabilities.

Here, we introduce Combocat, an open-source, end-to-end platform that integrates experimental and analytical workflows, underpinned by detailed protocols and documentation to enable reproducible, interpretable, and user-friendly drug combination screens. Combocat operates in two complementary modes, each facilitating fast and efficient combination screening. The “dense mode” measures all pairwise dose combinations in a dense 10 × 10 matrix format, tested in triplicate to ensure high fidelity and data quality. Using dense mode, we generated a comprehensive reference dataset of over 290,000 unique combination measurements (spanning 806 unique drug combinations) across diverse drugs and cell types. While this approach is ideal for high-quality data-rich screens, scaling dense mode to thousands of combinations is resource-intensive. To address this, we developed a machine learning-assisted “sparse mode”. Sparse mode reduces the number of direct experimental measurements by testing only the diagonal (10 dose pairs) of the 10 × 10 matrix and single-agent responses, then uses predictive modeling to obtain the remaining 90 values. Trained on the dense mode reference dataset, the predictive models in sparse mode enable ultrahigh-throughput screening with minimal resources. Notably, several other machine learning frameworks have been developed to predict synergy in different ways: TranSynergy21 leverages drug-target and gene-dependency features, SynToxProfiler22 computes integrated efficacy-toxicity-synergy surfaces, and comboFM23 uses tensor factorization to impute missing dose-response values. In contrast, Combocat's sparse mode measures only the 10 diagonal dose pairs and recovers the complete 10 × 10 response landscape via an ensemble of 90 per-pair regression models. As proof of concept, we used sparse mode to screen 9045 drug combinations in the neuroblastoma cell line CHP-134, representing the largest number of unique combinations tested in a single cell line to date. By integrating advanced liquid handling technologies with machine learning into an open-source and user-friendly platform, Combocat offers a scalable, efficient solution for accelerating the discovery of drug combinations.

To address longstanding challenges in drug combination screens—such as limited dose density, poor interpretability, and operational complexity–we developed Combocat to integrate experimental and analytical workflows into a user-friendly framework. The “dense mode” workflow facilitates comprehensive, dense measurements by systematically evaluating all pairwise dose combinations in a 10 × 10 matrix format (Fig. 1c). A customized acoustic liquid handling protocol prepares each 384-well plate with two drugs at ten concentrations each, including three replicate 10 × 10 combination matrices, single-agent dose-response curves, and internal controls (for example, twelve replicates each of cell death and vehicle controls). This design ensures robust normalization and reproducibility while reducing the time and effort typically associated with high-throughput combination screens.

Building on this experimental foundation, the analytical pipeline (Fig. 1d) maps raw data to their corresponding matrix positions, normalizes values to percentage cell death, and quantifies synergy using the Bliss independence model. Results are then filtered and ranked, enabling researchers to rapidly identify top-performing combinations and visualize complete synergy landscapes without extensive post-processing. By uniting dense measurements with a streamlined analytical workflow, Combocat's dense mode provides a high-fidelity framework for characterizing drug interactions in a reproducible and operationally straightforward manner.

Applying dense mode, we generated a reference dataset of 806 drug combinations comprising over 290,000 individual measurements in the 10 × 10 matrix format (Supplementary Data 1). This dataset was designed to evaluate a diverse range of drugs and cell types, ensuring generalizability across multiple experimental contexts. Assay quality was high, as indicated by Z′ values (mean = 0.747; Supplementary Fig. 1) and low standard deviations in both single-agent and combination measurements across the screen (Fig. 2a, b).

The standard deviation is measured across each dose of all single-agent drugs across their respective three replicates. b Distribution of combination standard deviations. For each drug combination, the standard deviation is measured across all 100 dose pairs and their respective three replicates. c Mean adjusted Bliss synergy (Blissadj.) for all tested drug combinations. Each point represents the mean Blissadj. value across the 100 dose pairs per combination. SMX_TMP is highlighted as the top-ranking combination. d Dose-response curves for SMX (top) and TMP (bottom).

The red dashed line indicates the expected response value under the Bliss model. h–k Like (d–g), for the combination of AZD1390 and CX-5461.

During analysis, we identified occasional spurious single-agent measurements, a common challenge in high-throughput screens24. These anomalies, often resulting from incomplete drug transfer or other technical issues, can distort synergy calculations by introducing outliers into the dataset (Supplementary Fig. 2a–d). To address this, we implemented a rigorous quality control (QC) pipeline that flags and adjusts anomalous data points using predefined thresholds for variability, dose-response residuals, and monotonicity (Supplementary Fig. 2e–g; see “Methods” section for details). Flagged values can be excluded from subsequent synergy calculations, yielding an “adjusted Bliss synergy” (Blissadj.) that omits these measurements. This QC approach ensures accurate synergy quantification by minimizing the impact of outliers.

To evaluate the platform's capacity to identify and replicate known synergistic interactions, we first examined the top-ranked combination in our dataset: sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (TMP) in E. coli cells (Fig. 2c). This pair is a well-established example of synergistic drug behavior9, widely used to treat various bacterial infections25. Both SMX and TMP displayed sigmoidal dose-dependent relationships (Fig. 2d), and when combined, exhibited strong synergy (Fig. 2e–g), aligning with established expectations. We further evaluated an additional known example of synergy included in our screen—the combination of AZD1390 and CX-5461—which has been reported as synergistic in Neuroblastoma cells26. The single-agent responses and strong synergy patterns (Fig. 2h–k) closely aligned to reported findings26. Collectively, these examples highlight Combocat's ability to faithfully reproduce known synergistic interactions and provide a framework for understanding complex combination landscapes.

While dense mode offers high-quality, data-rich combination measurements, scaling it to thousands of combinations can become resource-intensive. To address this, we developed a “sparse mode” workflow, which minimizes direct experimental measurements while still capturing synergy information between drug pairs. The sparse mode assay is miniaturized into a 1536-well format and separates the single agents and combinations into their own plates (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). Single-agent plates measure each drug across 10 doses, while combination plates only measure drug pairs at a relative 1:1 ratio—corresponding to the diagonal of a 10 × 10 matrix. Single-agent response values are mapped onto dose-response curves and integrated with combination data to assemble the sparse matrix (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d), which effectively cuts the required number of measurements by 90%.

By dramatically decreasing the experimental resource consumption per combination, sparse mode increases throughput and efficiency. For example, the workflow supports up to 135 single agents, which yields 9045 combinations and would require just 73 plates when using six replicates of single-agent plates (Supplementary Fig. 3e, f). Consequently, sparse mode's miniaturized design and efficient plate usage make ultra-large-scale combination screens available with minimal resources.

To enhance the utility of our sparse screening workflow, we developed an ensemble machine learning model capable of predicting the non-measured response values within a sparse matrix, effectively filling in the gaps to reconstruct the completed matrix. We leveraged the dense mode combination data to train the model, which provided fully-measured 10 × 10 matrices alongside their corresponding single-agent responses. From this, we curated a training set comprising 552 matrices (198,720 measurements) and a test set of 184 matrices (66,240 measurements) (Fig. 3a). Each non-measured index within the sparse matrix is predicted by a dedicated regression model within the ensemble, allowing all 90 models to be finely tuned for their respective targets (Fig. 3b, see “Methods” section).

a Composition of training and test sets used to develop the ensemble model. The training set includes 552 fully-measured 10 × 10 combination matrices (light orange, 75% of total data), while the test set has 184 matrices (dark orange, 25% of total data). b Overview of the ensemble machine learning model architecture. Ninety individual models are each designed to predict the response of a single non-measured index of a sparse matrix. Fully-measured 10 × 10 matrices from the training set are downsampled to reflect the 30 measured values collected in sparse mode (treated as features) and the index a given model aims to predict (treated as the outcome variable). Each model undergoes hyperparameter tuning and is fit with the XGBoost regression model (see “Methods” section). c Model performance measured by R2 across the 10 respective folds for each of the 90 models. Box plot center line represents the median (0.947), bounds are 25th and 75th percentiles (0.934 and 0.959), and whiskers extend to the most extreme data points within 1.5× the interquartile range from the box edges. The minimum is 0.860, the maximum is 0.983. d Variable importance (VI) contributed by the 30 measured values toward the model predicting index [1,2] (represented by a yellow circle) across the test set. e Comparison of observed versus predicted cell death response values for the model predicting index [1,2] across the test set. f–i Like (d, e) showing the VI and predictive performance for models [5,6] and [9,10], respectively. j Violin plot summarizing the Euclidean distances between the target index of a model and its corresponding feature index with the maximum importance value, across all 90 models. The dashed line represents the median Euclidean distance (d = 2) across all samples, with model [4,6] highlighted as an example (red dot). k Example of the model predicting index [4,6], illustrating the Euclidean distance (d = 2) from its target index to the feature index with the maximum importance value. l Overall predictive performance of the model across all samples in the test set (n = 184). m Overview of the sparse mode workflow, integrating the experimental generation of sparse matrices with the machine learning-based imputation of non-measured response values.

Our model demonstrated a high predictive accuracy, with a median R2 of 0.945 across 10-fold cross-validation (Fig. 3c). Analyzing variable importance (VI) revealed that predictions were most strongly influenced by measured values closest to the target index. For instance, the model predicting the response at row 1, column 2 (Model[1,2]), primarily relied on data from its two nearest measured indices (Fig. 3d). Despite relying heavily on only two of the 30 measured values, this model achieved strong predictive performance (r = 0.98) between the observed and predicted values in the test set (Fig. 3e). Similar patterns were observed throughout the ensemble, with strong performance across models predicting values near the diagonal (Fig. 3f, g) and those in the lower-right quadrant of the matrix (Fig. 3h, i). A broader analysis of all models confirmed a proximity-based dependency, with most predictions relying on measured indices within a Euclidean distance of 1 or 2 from the target index (Fig. 3j, k). These findings underscore the importance of leveraging local features for predicting sparse matrix values and highlight the advantage of training dedicated models for each of the 90 non-measured indices, enabling highly targeted predictions (Supplementary Data 2).

To evaluate the ensemble's overall performance, we compared observed and predicted cell death responses across all non-measured indices in the test set. This yielded a strong correlation (r = 0.98, Supplementary Data 3) (Fig. 3l), demonstrating the ensemble's reliability in capturing key combination response effects. By predicting non-measured values, the ensemble model enriches the sparse screening workflow, providing detailed insights that enhance the interpretability of synergy results while preserving resource efficiency (Fig. 3m).

To demonstrate the scalability and practical utility of Combocat, we applied the sparse mode workflow to screen 9045 drug combinations in the neuroblastoma cell line CHP-134 (Supplementary Data 4), representing the largest dense combination screen reported in a single cell line. We used 135 small molecules, encompassing approved chemotherapeutics, investigational compounds, and neuroblastoma-selective agents nominated from our earlier CRISPR screens27. (Supplementary Data 5). Synergy was quantified for each pair by their mean Blissadj. (observed) score—the adjusted Bliss synergy averaged across the matrix diagonal (10 measured dose pairs) (Fig. 4a). Most combinations centered near zero (Fig. 4b), indicating a predominance of additive or non-synergistic interactions and aligning with prior findings that strong synergy is a rare phenomenon20,28,29.

a Heatmap of the mean adjusted Bliss synergy scores (Blissadj.) across experimentally observed 10 dose pairs for each of the 9045 tested combinations. b–e Histograms of the mean Blissadj. (observed), Moran's I, QC flag count (observed), and mean % cell death, respectively, across the combination data. c–e highlight filters applied to exclude (gray) or include (green) combinations in the final hit list. f Filtered combinations (n = 594), ranked by their mean Blissadj. (observed) scores. The top 15 hits are labeled above. g–n Comparison of the top 2 hits from sparse mode (upper matrices) re-screened using dense mode (lower matrices). The cell death (g, h, k, l) and synergy (i, j, m, n) matrices are compared between the two modes.

To prioritize drug combinations for further exploration, we used three filtering criteria that captured spatially coherent synergy patterns (Moran's I), data reliability (QC flag counts), and biological relevance (mean cell death response, Fig. 4c–e, see “Methods” section). After filtering, 594 top-scoring pairs remained, ranked by mean Blissadj. (observed) (Fig. 4f). To validate these sparse mode predictions, we re-screened a subset of 40 combinations in dense mode: the top 30 from sparse mode (expected to display the highest synergy) plus 10 randomly selected combinations that had been excluded. Measuring these combinations in a fully sampled 10 × 10 format enabled a direct comparison to sparse mode results.

Most top-ranked drug pairs retained strong synergy patterns, confirming that sparse mode can effectively prioritize synergistic combinations (Supplementary Fig. 4a). In contrast, the 10 random pairs exhibited weaker synergy in dense mode, matching their lower sparse mode scores. We additionally compared single-agent dose-response curves for the 47 unique drugs in the validation set and observed close alignment (rho = 0.858) of IC50 values and fitted dose-response curves (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c), reinforcing the consistency of single-agent measurements obtained in sparse mode.

Among the validated hits, the ATM inhibitor AZD1390 in combination with the PARP inhibitors Olaparib or Rucaparib stood out for their pronounced synergy (Fig. 4g, i, k, m). This aligns mechanistically with targeting complementary DNA damage repair pathways: PARP inhibition leads to accumulation of single-strand breaks, while ATM inhibition impairs the double-strand break repair response30. Re-testing these combinations in dense mode confirmed high agreement (Fig. 4h, j, l, n), meaning strong, reliable synergies could be identified from the starting set of over 9000 screened combinations. Collectively, these data establish Combocat's sparse mode as an efficient and scalable means of uncovering synergy even in ultra-large-scale screens.

Combocat presents a step toward more comprehensive, flexible, and scalable drug combination screening. By uniting acoustic liquid handling and machine learning-assisted inference, we have demonstrated the feasibility of screening thousands of combinations while retaining the resolution and interpretability crucial to discovering strong synergistic interactions. The principles underpinning Combocat are broadly applicable, with a design that supports compatibility with various assay readouts that align with specified volumes and plate formats—such as luminescence, absorbance (Supplementary Fig. 6), fluorescence, mass spectrometry, or high-content imaging. Furthermore, the open-source acoustic liquid handler protocols ensure adaptability to other drug dispensing platforms with comparable capabilities, establishing Combocat as a scalable foundation for diverse experimental applications.

The functionality and workflow of Combocat are designed to be straightforward, including its minimal and intuitive analytical pipeline (Supplementary Fig. 5a). This streamlined architecture, along with open-source and detailed documentation, ensures that researchers can easily implement and customize Combocat experiments according to their needs. Our goal is to pursue continual refinement and expansion of the platform. One of the most compelling aspects of Combocat lies in its potential for community-driven advancement. As more research groups generate dense combination data, these datasets can be anonymized and contributed back to the community for re-training and improving the ensemble machine learning model (Supplementary Fig. 5b). This communal effort could result in a dynamic resource capable of delivering progressively more accurate synergy estimates with minimal experimental overhead.

While Combocat enables high-throughput combination screening in various contexts, some limitations are important to acknowledge. First, the accuracy of sparse mode inference is inherently dependent on the quality and diversity of the training data. We tested three progressively stringent stratifications of our dense mode dataset (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c) and found essentially identical predictive performance (r≈0.97, Supplementary Fig. 7d–f), demonstrating no simple data leakage in predicting responses in Neuroblastoma. However, as new data are collaboratively added, preventing leakage through continuous hold-out testing will be essential to maintain the model's robustness and generalizability. Second, although dense and sparse modes' experimental measurements largely agree, they will differ in some circumstances. Sparse mode uses miniaturized volumes and a different plate format, which can occasionally introduce shifts in drug potency or dynamic range. This can be related to technical factors like compound dispersion in smaller volumes, plate layout effects, or variations in cell confluence in smaller wells. Finally, while Combocat supports Bliss and Loewe synergy metrics, each carries assumptions and limitations. For example, Bliss can misestimate synergy for drugs targeting similar pathways, and Loewe cannot calculate synergy in the absence of dose-equivalence (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b)—making it undefined in 61.5% of sparse mode dose combinations tested (Supplementary Fig. 8c). We compared the mean synergy scores in our combinations passing QC and filtering steps (n = 800) and observed a modest agreement between the Bliss and Loewe models (Spearman rho = −0.672, p < 2.2e-16, Supplementary Fig. 8d). Importantly, additional reference models exist such as Highest Single Agent (HSA)31, Zero Interaction Potency (ZIP)32(which models changes in potency of the dose-response curves), and others, which can be evaluated in future extensions of the platform.

We envision leveraging Combocat's scalability to investigate more of the vast unexplored drug combination space, mapping out the synergy landscapes of thousands of drug combinations across many cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 5c). By integrating sparse mode workflows with continuously evolving machine learning models, rich synergy datasets can be generated, capable of capturing complex biological responses. Such comprehensive synergy maps will empower researchers to identify conserved interactions, reveal lineage-specific vulnerabilities, and guide the rational selection of combination therapies.

This study complied with all relevant ethical regulations.

The CHP-134 cell line was purchased from Sigma (catalog #6122002) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Corning, catalog #10-041-CM) supplemented with 10% FBS (Corning, catalog #35-015-CV) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Mycoplasma was routinely tested using the MycoAlert mycoplasma detection kit (Lonza, catalog # LT07-118), and the cells were verified negative for contamination.

For experiments with bacterial cultures, the Escherichia coli BW25113 strain (Horizon Discovery Ltd.) was cultured at 37 °C in Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar or broth (BBL). Cultures in exponential phase (OD600 0.4–0.6) were diluted to OD600 of 0.0005 for plating in 384-well format.

Compounds were sourced from commercial vendors (see Supplementary Data 5). Stocks were solubilized in DMSO and stored at −80 °C until 24 h before use, at which point they were thawed at room temperature and centrifuged at 1100 RPM for 5 min. Across all assays, compounds were screened at 10 concentrations using 3-fold serial dilutions, typically with an upper limit of 25 µM. Most compounds were screened below and above their physiologically-relevant doses, and in a way positioning their suspected IC50s as the midpoint to attempt achieving a complete dose-response effect.

The choice of 135 compounds used in sparse mode comes from drugs targeting the top neuroblastoma-selective sensitizers from earlier CRISPR-anchor screens27. Specifically, drugs were chosen using the following approach:

Our previous CRISPR knockout-anchor screens investigated 18 cell lines using 7 neuroblastoma standard-of-care drugs and 1 investigational compound (Doxorubicin, Etoposide, Retinoic Acid, Topotecan, Vincristine, Cisplatin, Phosphoramide Mustard, and JQAD1). The CRISPR knockout library was designed to target 655 known druggable genes. These screens were designed to identify druggable gene knockouts that sensitize cancer cells to standard-of-care neuroblastoma drugs.

To identify these high-potential drug-sensitizing gene knockouts from the resulting dataset, we applied a custom Bayesian hierarchical model (described in the “Methods” section of Lee and Wright et al.) to nominate genes with differential sensitization effects in the Neuroblastoma group, relative to the outgroup cell.

We then compiled the list of drugs that targeted the resulting neuroblastoma-selective sensitizing gene knockouts. For genes targetable by >1 drug, the list was reduced manually, considering factors such as clinical approval, redundancy with other drugs, number of analogs, and compound availability.

Finally, we manually added high-priority investigational compounds to the list after consultation with multiple pediatric oncologists at St. Jude, yielding the final number of 135 unique drugs. The list of drugs is available in Supplementary Data 5.

To enable comprehensive and reproducible measurement of pairwise dose combinations in a 10 × 10 matrix format, we designed a 384-well plate template that accommodates three replicate 10 × 10 combination matrices in a 384-well plate format, along with three replicates of the dose-response curves for each single-agent and twelve replicates of each positive and negative control (Fig. 1c). In each well, 200 nL of total compound was transferred via an Echo 655 acoustic liquid handler (Beckman Coulter): 100 nL of compound + 100 nL of DMSO for single-agent wells, or 100 nL of each compound for combination wells. This was followed by 40 μL of cells, added using a Multidrop combi (Thermo Fisher). Maintaining a 40 μL volume of cells minimized edge effects arising from evaporation. Each dense mode plate tested exactly one drug combination, making the total plate count for a dense mode experiment scale linearly with the number of drug pairs.

Sparse mode was designed to increase throughput and reduce resource usage by miniaturizing the assay into a 1536-well plate format (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). Three key features enable ultra-large combination screens in sparse mode:

Miniaturized volumes: Only 20 nL of compound is transferred (10 nL of each drug for combinations or 10 nL of drug + 10 nL of DMSO for single-agent wells), followed by 4 μL of cells. Edge wells are filled with culture medium to mitigate evaporation. Doses are interleaved to minimize well-to-well signal contamination.

Measurement of the diagonal only: Each 10 × 10 matrix is represented by 10 dose pairs that combine each drug at a relative 1:1 ratio. For example, the 6th-highest tested dose of Drug 1 with the 6th-highest tested dose of Drug 2. This reduces the total measured dose pairs by 90%, compared to a fully-measured 10 × 10 matrix (Supplementary Fig. 3d).

Separate single-agent and combination plates: Single-agent and combination plates are tested separately, with single-agents testing each drug's 10-dose series, and combinations testing only the diagonal dose pairs. This allows single agents to be mapped onto combination matrices without being re-measured. For example, to screen the combinations A_B and A_C, dense mode would measure A twice, whereas sparse mode would measure A once. Within-plate controls facilitate normalization before integration into assembled matrices.

The total number of plates required for a sparse mode screen can be calculated as:

where c is the total number of cell lines, r is the total number of single-agent plate replicates, and n is the number of unique drugs. The 135 value comes directly from the number of unique drugs able to fit within the usable (non-edge) wells of the 1536-well plates.

For both dense and sparse modes, compounds were transferred into empty 384- or 1536-well plates (Corning) using the Echo 655 acoustic liquid handler with Combocat protocol files (available at combocat.stjude.org). After compound transfer, cells were dispensed at seeding densities of 1000 cells/well in 384-well plates or 200 cells/well in 1536-well plates. For E. coli cells (which were only screened in 384-well plates), an OD600 of 0.0005 was used. In 1536-well plates, cells were strained through a 70 µM cell strainer before being dispensed. The final DMSO concentration after cell addition was 0.5% in all wells.

Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. Cell viability was assessed after the 3-day treatment using CellTiter-Glo (or BacTiter-Glo for bacterial cells) by adding either 25 µL (to 384-well plates) or 2 µL (to 1536-well plates) of prepared reagent and reading luminescence on an EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer). For the absorbance-based readout of cell viability, 8 µL of MTS reagent (Abcam) at 0.5× concentration was added to the cells at the endpoint time. The MTS reagent was incubated with cells for 3 h, and plates were read at 490 nanometers on a Cytation 5 plate reader (BioTek).

The quality of all screened assay plates was assessed using the Z′ metric33, which measures quality as a function of signal window and data variation, given by:

where σNeg/Pos and μNeg/Pos represent the standard deviation and means of the controls, respectively. A Z′ value of ≥0.5 is generally regarded as an excellent separation of controls.

The Combocat ensemble machine learning model was developed as a collection of 90 individual models, each built to predict one of the 90 non-measured indices of a sparse matrix. To construct these models, an input dataset was first assembled containing all fully-measured data collected via dense mode, totaling over 800 combination matrices and their single-agent response values (Supplementary Data 1). The input dataset was first filtered to remove any matrices with a mean cell death value < 10%. Next, this dataset was split into 75% for training and 25% for the test set, respectively. This resulted in a training set of 552 matrices (198,720 measurements) and a test set of 184 matrices (66,240 measurements). Note that while the combination matrix itself has dimensions of 10 × 10, including the single-agent data effectively extends this into an 11 × 11 grid, where the 1st column and 11th row represent the single-agent responses (Supplementary Fig. 9a). This format was used for associating a model with its respective index. Each model was trained on 30 features: response values from 10 single-agent indices each from Drug 1 and Drug 2, and 10 indices corresponding to the matrix diagonal, which represent each drug's concentration combined at a relative 1:1 ratio (Supplementary Fig. 9b). These 30 features correspond to the 30 indices measured experimentally in the sparse mode workflow (Supplementary Fig. 3d) and were used across the input data to generate the models predicting the 90 total indices of a sparse matrix (Supplementary Fig. 9c).

The training of each model involved fitting the tree-based regression model XGBoost34. Hyperparameter tuning was enabled to optimize model performance, which was accomplished using a space-filling grid design to efficiently test 40 combinations of the hyperparameters (detailed in Supplementary Data 6). A 10-fold cross-validation was used to select the optimal set of hyperparameters based on the lowest R2 value. Once identified, each model was trained using its respective optimal hyperparameters on the entire training set. The performance of each model was evaluated across all folds, gauged by R2 and RMSE. For each model, the variable importance was measured across each of the 30 features (30 measured response values from sparse matrices) to evaluate their predictive impact (Supplementary Data 7). Next, the trained models were validated on their test sets to ensure their predictive capability by comparing the observed vs. predicted cell death response values. The comparison of observed vs. predicted response values across the 90 models collectively was used to summarize the predictive performance of the ensemble model. Finally, the ensemble model was serialized in a format that allows for rapid deployment for future sparse matrix predictions. All model generation was performed using the tidymodels framework (tidymodels.org).

To ensure data integrity and mitigate the impact of spurious measurements, we implemented a rigorous quality control (QC) procedure focusing on three key metrics: single-agent standard deviation, residuals from single-agent dose-response curves, and monotonicity of the cell death response.

For each single-agent drug, we first calculated the standard deviation of the percentage cell death (% cell death) values across all replicates at each dose level, resulting in ten standard deviation values per agent corresponding to the ten doses tested. Any dose with a percentage cell death standard deviation exceeding a predefined threshold (Tdefault) of 29 was flagged for disqualification. All combination data points involving that particular dose were also flagged for disqualification (Supplementary Fig. 2e). Next, we fitted a four-parameter log-logistic model to the dose-response data for each single-agent drug. For each dose, we calculated the residual – the difference between the observed percentage cell death and the value predicted by the fitted curve. Doses with residuals whose absolute value exceeded the Tdefault threshold of 15% were disqualified (Supplementary Fig. 2f). Finally, we assessed the monotonicity of the cell death response, under the assumption that percentage cell death should increase monotonically with increasing drug concentration. We evaluated the differences in cell death between the consecutive doses. If the cell death response decreased from one dose to the next by more than the Tdefault threshold of 16% (i.e., a decrease greater than 16%), the corresponding dose was disqualified (Supplementary Fig. 2g). For sparse mode data, we additionally evaluated the monotonicity of the observed combination responses along the diagonal of the 10 × 10 matrix – the ten observed combination values corresponding to increasing dose pairs combined at relative 1:1 ratios. If any of these combination responses decreased by more than 16% compared to the previous dose pair, that specific combination value was disqualified (Supplementary Fig. 2h). After assessing a combination matrix using all three QC metrics, the flagged values were tracked and could be excluded from summary statistics if desired. For example, a combination matrix could be summarized by its mean Bliss synergy score (which averages over all 100 Bliss synergy values of the 10 × 10 matrix), or by its “adjusted” Bliss synergy score (which only averages over the non-disqualified Bliss synergy values).

A pairwise combination screen of 135 drugs was performed in the CHP-134 cells. Each single-agent plate was replicated six times. Drug combinations were prioritized for further exploration by first applying a series of filtering criteria:

Moran's I, a measure of spatial autocorrelation35, was used to assess the distribution of synergy across each 10 × 10 combination matrix. Moran's I quantifies the degree to which similar scores cluster together in space and was applied to all synergy matrices (Supplementary fig. 10). A high Moran's I indicates that similar synergy scores are similarly clustered, forming cohesive patterns, whereas low values suggest a random distribution with no discernible pattern. We reasoned that synergy matrices exhibited such localized motifs likely reflect coherent biological effects, while sporadic patterns are more likely to signify noise or spurious results. All matrices with a Moran's I value of <0.6 were filtered out to retain only those with strong patterns of spatial autocorrelation.

All combination matrices were subjected to a filter based on the quality of the measured values. The ten measured values, corresponding to the diagonal of the 10 × 10 matrix, were subjected to our QC pipeline. If more than six of these ten measured values were flagged by the QC pipeline as unreliable, the matrices were excluded.

The mean percentage cell death was also used as a filter for the screening data. For all 100 dose pairs per combination, the mean was calculated, and only matrices with ≥20% cell death were retained for further analysis. This ensured that the high-ranking synergy was also meaningful in terms of inducing cell death.

Once the screening data were filtered, combinations were ranked by their mean Blissadj. (observed) values. This metric is simply the mean of the 10 measured values per combination after they were subjected to QC (Fig. 4a).

A year of chaos. That is how many researchers in the United States, at least, will remember 2025. Cuts to federal funding and the federal workforce, political threats to US universities, an immigration crackdown and the country's withdrawal from global organizations have stymied research in many fields and reshaped, probably for decades to come, the landscape of the world's leading sponsor of science. Throughout the world, financial pressures, political interference and rising nationalist sentiment have put increased strain on a scientific enterprise that thrives on independence, openness and diversity, as Nature's special series on the future of universities has reported over the past few months.

Yet there remains much to celebrate — which is made plain in the stories of the scientists and innovators profiled in this year's Nature's 10, a selection of ten people who shaped the research landscape in 2025.

Some stood up for scientific values, such as Susan Monarez, who was fired after a brief tenure as head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, during which time she was asked to pre-approve vaccine recommendations without considering the relevant data.

Others kept the flame of multilateralism and evidence-based policymaking burning. In a year of rising tensions and unresolved conflicts, the agreement of the world's first pandemic treaty in April was a bright spot. Some details still need to be hammered out, but representatives of the 190-odd nations that are members of the World Health Organization — with the exception of the United States, which withdrew from the treaty negotiations in January — managed to forge an agreement on how humanity should prevent and prepare for future pandemics. Negotiations leader Precious Matsoso, a former director-general of South Africa's health department, describes the gruelling process, and how persistence, humour and a constructive approach paid off.

Grant cuts, arrests, lay-offs: Trump made 2025 a tumultuous year for science

And several feed humanity's insatiable thirst for knowledge. In 2025, geoscientist and diver Mengran Du at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering in Sanya and her colleagues reported the deepest ecosystem known to host animals, in an underwater trench northeast of Japan1. This chemosynthetic ecosystem derives its energy from methane and other compounds that seep up from the ocean floor — in contrast to most life, which depends on sunlight and the process of photosynthesis. There is still much about our planet that we don't understand, but a thriving global enterprise of science can uncover its mysteries.

Reflecting that, seven of this year's profiles are of individuals outside the United States. Among them is entrepreneur Liang Wenfeng in Hangzhou, China, whose company created the country's home-grown artificial-intelligence model DeepSeek-R1. The breakneck speed of developments in AI — with all its benefits and risks — was another key story of this year. DeepSeek stunned the world with a model that had capabilities on a par with the best tools designed by more established technology firms, yet made for a fraction of the cost and with unusual openness. In September, the model became the first major AI tool to be scrutinized by peer review, with the results published in this journal2.

Transformative science can transform lives. Entomologist Luciano Moreira established a company in Curitiba, Brazil, that infects Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with a bacterium called Wolbachia, curbing the insects' ability to transmit human pathogens. Moreira helped to persuade the government to use the approach to combat the mosquito-borne disease dengue, which killed some 6,300 people in Brazilian cities last year.

The future of universities

The future of universities

And, in Israel, systems biologist Yifat Merbl at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot and her team reported that a piece of cellular machinery — the proteasome, which chops up proteins into smaller peptide fragments — has a role in immunity3. They found that many of these peptides have antimicrobial properties and that cells use them as a first line of defence against bacteria.

Besides being at the cutting edge of their fields, Moreira and Merbl share something else: they both studied in the United States before returning home. Their stories are a reminder of the unique part the country has played in recent decades in supporting science around the world, as it has nurtured its own research — a win–win for the nation and the world. That network now seems at risk as an immigration crackdown makes it more difficult, more expensive and less attractive for researchers globally to study and work not just in the United States, but in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, too.

The individuals who feature in Nature's 10, and their breakthroughs, showcase the ongoing strength of science globally: its ability to transcend national borders and nurture collaboration, and its power to save and improve lives, satisfy curiosity and spark innovation. They also serve as a reminder of what is lost when governments cease to follow the evidence, stop funding excellent science and fail to nurture the international collaborative spirit that creates the breakthroughs that make the world a better place for all.

A hallmark of most breast cancers1 is the expression of a hormone receptor called oestrogen receptor-α (ERα). People with this type of cancer typically receive endocrine therapy, involving oestrogen-blocking drugs such as tamoxifen, but the development of resistance to this treatment is a common clinical challenge2. One way to enhance the effectiveness of endocrine therapy and delay the emergence of resistance is through periodic fasting, when, under clinical supervision, people restrict their eating and consume few or no calories for time spans of hours to days on a regular cycle. However, the mechanisms underlying this effect have been hard to determine3. Writing in Nature, Padrão et al.4 now provide some answers regarding the consequences of such fasting.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Nvidia Becomes a Major Model Maker With Nemotron 3","https://www.wired.com/story/nvidia-becomes-major-model-maker-nemotron-3/","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

Nvidia has made a fortune supplying chips to companies working on artificial intelligence, but today the chipmaker took a step toward becoming a more serious model maker itself by releasing a series of cutting-edge open models, along with data and tools to help engineers use them.

The move, which comes at a moment when AI companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic are developing increasingly capable chips of their own, could be a hedge against these firms veering away from Nvidia's technology over time.

Open models are already a crucial part of the AI ecosystem with many researchers and startups using them to experiment, prototype, and build. While OpenAI and Google offer small open models, they do not update them as frequently as their rivals in China. For this reason and others, open models from Chinese companies are currently much more popular, according to data from Hugging Face, a hosting platform for open source projects.

Nvidia's new Nemotron 3 models are among the best that can be downloaded, modified, and run on one's own hardware, according to benchmark scores shared by the company ahead of release.

“Open innovation is the foundation of AI progress,” CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement ahead of the news. “With Nemotron, we're transforming advanced AI into an open platform that gives developers the transparency and efficiency they need to build agentic systems at scale.”

Nvidia is taking a more fully transparent approach than many of its US rivals by releasing the data used to train Nemotron—a fact that should help engineers modify the models more easily. The company is also releasing tools to help with customization and fine-tuning. This includes a new hybrid latent mixture-of-experts model architecture, which Nvidia says is especially good for building AI agents that can take actions on computers or the web. The company is also launching libraries that allow users to train agents to do things using reinforcement learning, which involves giving models simulated rewards and punishments.

Nemotron 3 models come in three sizes: Nano, which has 30 billion parameters; Super, which has 100 billion; and Ultra, which has 500 billion. A model's parameters loosely correspond to how capable it is as well as how unwieldy it is to run. The largest models are so cumbersome that they need to run on racks of expensive hardware.

Kari Ann Briski, vice president of generative AI software for enterprise at Nvidia, said open models are important to AI builders for three reasons: Builders increasingly need to customize models for particular tasks; it often helps to hand queries off to different models; and it is easier to squeeze more intelligent responses from these models after training by having them perform a kind of simulated reasoning. “We believe open source is the foundation for AI innovation, continuing to accelerate the global economy,” Briski said.

The social media giant Meta released the first advanced open models under the name Llama in February 2023. As competition has intensified, however, Meta has signaled that its future releases might not be open source.

The move is part of a larger trend in the AI industry. Over the past year, US firms have moved away from openness, becoming more secretive about their research and more reluctant to tip off their rivals about their latest engineering tricks.

A recent report from OpenRouter, a company that gives people access to different models through a single user interface, shows that open models accounted for around a third of all tokens—units of text and other data—sent through its systems in 2025. Chinese firms including DeepSeek, Alibaba, Moonshot AI, Z.ai, and MiniMax regularly release powerful open models and publish details about their research advancements that make their offerings more appealing for engineers to experiment with.

This could prove troublesome for Nvidia. The company's hardware has become so important in the world of AI that its silicon has become a bargaining chip in Trump's trade dealings in China. The US government recently said it would allow Nvidia to export H200 chips—the best of its previous generation—to China, but the Chinese government is keen to achieve greater technological independence and has taken steps to push Chinese companies to use home-grown chips. This could mean Chinese AI models become more closely aligned with Chinese silicon, which could undermine Nvidia's position.

For the last year and a half, two hacked white Tesla Model 3 sedans each loaded with five extra cameras and one palm-sized supercomputer have quietly cruised around San Francisco. In a city and era swarming with questions about the capabilities and limits of artificial intelligence, the startup behind the modified Teslas is trying to answer what amounts to a simple question: How quickly can a company build autonomous vehicle software today?

The startup, which is making its activities public for the first time today, is called HyprLabs. Its 17-person team (just eight of them full-time) is divided between Paris and San Francisco, and the company is helmed by an autonomous vehicle company veteran, Zoox cofounder Tim Kentley-Klay, who suddenly exited the now Amazon-owned firm in 2018. Hypr has taken in relatively little funding, $5.5 million since 2022, but its ambitions are wide-ranging. Eventually, it plans to build and operate its own robots. “Think of the love child of R2-D2 and Sonic the Hedgehog,” Kentley-Klay says. “It's going to define a new category that doesn't currently exist.”

For now, though, the startup is announcing its software product called Hyprdrive, which it bills as a leap forward in how engineers train vehicles to pilot themselves. These sorts of leaps are all over the robotics space, thanks to advances in machine learning that promise to bring down the cost of training autonomous vehicle software, and the amount of human labor involved. This training evolution has brought new movement to a space that for years suffered through a “trough of disillusionment,” as tech builders failed to meet their own deadlines to operate robots in public spaces. Now, robotaxis pick up paying passengers in more and more cities, and automakers make newly ambitious promises about bringing self-driving to customers' personal cars.

But using a small, agile, and cheap team to get from ""driving pretty well” to “driving much more safely than a human” is its own long hurdle. “I can't say to you, hand on heart, that this will work,” Kentley-Klay says. “But what we've built is a really solid signal. It just needs to be scaled up.”

HyprLabs' software training technique is a departure from other robotics' startups approaches to teaching their systems to drive themselves.

First, some background: For years, the big battle in autonomous vehicles seemed to be between those who used just cameras to train their software—Tesla!—and those who depended on other sensors, too—Waymo, Cruise!—including once-expensive lidar and radar. But below the surface, larger philosophical differences churned.

Camera-only adherents like Tesla wanted to save money while scheming to launch a gigantic fleet of robots; for a decade, CEO Elon Musk's plan has been to suddenly switch all of his customers' cars to self-driving ones with the push of a software update. The upside was that these companies had lots and lots of data, as their not-yet self-driving cars collected images wherever they drove. This information got fed into what's called an “end-to-end” machine learning model through reinforcement. The system takes in images—a bike—and spits out driving commands—move the steering wheel to the left and go easy on the acceleration to avoid hitting it. “It's like training a dog,” says Philip Koopman, an autonomous vehicle software and safety researcher at Carnegie Mellon University. “At the end, you say, ‘Bad dog,” or ‘Good dog.'”

The multi-sensor proponents, meanwhile, spent more money up front. They had smaller fleets that captured less data, but they were willing to pay big teams of humans to label that information, so that the autonomous driving software could train on it. This is what a bike looks like, and this is how it moves, these humans taught the self-driving systems through machine learning. Meanwhile, engineers were able to program in rules and exceptions, so that the system wouldn't expect, say, a picture of a bike to behave like a three-dimensional one.

HyprLabs believes it can sort of do both, and thinks it can squeeze a last-mover advantage out of its more efficient approach. The startup says its system, which it is in talks to license to other robotics companies, can learn on the job, in real-time, with very little data. It calls the technique “run-time learning.” The company starts with a transformer model, a kind of neural network, which then learns as it drives under the guidance of the human supervisors. Only novel bits of data are sent back to the startup's “mothership,” which is used to fine-tune the system. Only the bits that are changed are sent back to the vehicle's systems. In total, Hypr's two Teslas have only collected 4,000 hours of driving data—about 65,000 miles' worth—and the company has only used about 1,600 of those hours to actually train the system. Compare that to Waymo, which has driven 100 million fully autonomous miles in its decade-plus of life.

Still, the company isn't prepared to run a Waymo-style service on public roads (and may operate in other, non-street contexts, too). “We're not saying this is production-ready and safety-ready,” says Kentley-Klay, “But we're showing an impressive ability to drive with an excruciatingly small amount of [computational work].”

The startup's real test might come next year, when it plans to introduce its untraditional robot. “It's pretty wild,” Kentley-Klay says.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","A New Las Vegas Attraction Serves Up Alien Foxes, Exoplanets, and VR Carl Sagan","https://www.wired.com/story/interstellar-arc-las-vegas/","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

It feels like I've been transported into a scene straight out of a science fiction movie.

I'm walking around on a giant centrifuge in space, which I can see the outlines of at the edge of my vision. Beyond it, I see the planet we're orbiting. The pathways I walk on stretch endlessly above and below me, giving me the feeling I'm in an absolutely massive structure. Huge hologram-like characters, each 10 stories tall, occasionally materialize alongside the path to talk to me and the dozen people also on this journey.

Those fellow travelers aren't computer-generated characters; they're real humans. We're all walking around wearing VR headsets in a shared virtual reality space in Las Vegas that can best be described as an amusement park ride for the visual cortex. Everyone else in the group sees the same scene, each from slightly different perspectives as they shuffle around freely.

Interstellar Arc, Vegas's latest immersive attraction in the city's Area15 entertainment district, is a stark reimagining of virtual reality within larger physical spaces. The narrative adventure utilizes recent advances in VR, resulting in a forward-looking technological undertaking that likely wouldn't have been possible even a few years ago.

And as VR technology gets lighter, faster, and more advanced, experiences like these may help drive the future of an industry that's struggled to find its footing in the mainstream after more than a decade on the commercial market. I went to Las Vegas to step inside Interstellar Arc myself and find out if it might help push virtual reality forward.

The project is the brainchild of Felix & Paul Studios, helmed by cofounders Paul Raphaël, Félix Lajeunesse, and Stéphane Rituit. Raphaël and Lajeunesse spent years as a traditional filmmaking duo, but had already begun to transition to more immersive storytelling formats when they demoed the Oculus Rift headset soon after it hit the market in 2013. They were sold immediately.

“We decided that this was the future of our lives, and that we were going to dedicate ourselves to telling stories in VR,” Raphaël says.

Raphaël says F&P developed the first VR camera that could film in 360 degrees and was involved in a number of early VR experiences. The team worked with the likes of Cirque du Soleil, Steven Spielberg, and even the Obama White House, earning several prime-time Emmy awards along the way. But their work in outer space stood out.

In partnership with NASA, F&P sent three VR cameras to the International Space Station—two inside, plus another attached to an exterior arm to quite literally film from space. From here they developed “Space Explorers: The Infinite,” a touring immersive pop-up meant to bring the space experience to average people in various cities globally. Interstellar Arc is the next evolution of this work.

(I toured the experience at the invitation of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, which covered some of my travel expenses.)

The “spaceport” leads you to the city of Cosmopolis.

Sit here to begin your journey.

After you buy a ticket for $54 ($39 for kids 8 to 12), you start the Interstellar Arc experience by stepping into a futuristic lobby dressed up as a “spaceport.” As visitors, we are told we're now in the 25th century and are about to embark on humanity's first interstellar mission to explore the distant exoplanet Arcadia. We're each outfitted with our own wireless Meta Quest 3S headsets—each affixed with some noise-canceling headphones—then take our seats inside the virtual Arc for liftoff.

The initial “voyage” segment leverages F&P's work aboard the ISS to create a wildly realistic view of Earth and our galaxy as we depart. While still in our seats, we enter 262 years of simulated “cryogenic sleep” aboard the Arc, then arrive at what we're told is a man-made orbital centrifuge city above Arcadia, called Cosmopolis.

This is where the ambulatory part of the journey begins. We disembark into Cosmopolis, a sprawling landscape that's designed to feel vast. I can see a winding pathway out in front of me, surrounded by a combination of trees, columns, and futuristic structures. The city seems to extend for miles in both my horizontal and vertical vision; I can see outer space and Arcadia, a planet that's half blue like Earth and half red like Mars, through the city's translucent skeleton.

With our headsets on, we walk around on pathways enclosed by railings; these railings are real, and designed to be visible within the VR experience. You can hold onto them if you need help orienting and balancing yourself, but they also serve to help direct participants to various parts of the indoor space throughout the experience. But there aren't always railings, and when those are absent, we're kept on the virtual path only by being able to see the edges of it, beyond which lies just black nothingness. My eyes tell me I'll plunge into the abyss if I fall off a pathway, even if my conscious brain knows otherwise. This fun psychological trick creates enough tension to keep me on the path despite the underlying knowledge that I probably don't really have to.

The fox helps you navigate Cosmopolis.

A virtual alien fox with silver fur serves as a guide as we wander, often walking ahead of us and prompting us with its snout to explore different areas. We can't really interact with it, which is a bummer given how adorable and pet-able it looks. Basketball-sized hovering orbs appear and serve as achievement checkpoints. My headset tracks how many of these achievements I collect through the experience; I managed 20 of a possible 30. At one point we go “underwater,” a sensation that comes complete with a visual rippling effect as we move around, along with some pretty convincing audio.

Your hands play a role too. A virtual button on my right wrist toggles a camera; one click of the button brings up a viewfinder in the center of my field of view, then a second click snaps a picture I can download later. A button on my left wrist triggers a radio I can use to communicate with the others in my group. If Raphaël, who joined us for our voyage, ever got sick of me using this feature to ping him with incessant questions throughout the hourlong experience, he was kind enough not to mention it.

Hundred-foot-high hologram-like characters periodically appear alongside the paths we walk on (again, everything just feels huge in here), offering us guidance or fun Cosmopolis factoids. One such hologram is a representation of none other than famed astronomer Carl Sagan, who serves as Cosmopolis' “Librarian” and talks to us about his role in preserving Earth's knowledge as humanity expands outward. The Sagan hologram also references the Golden Record, a phonograph record sent on the two Voyager spacecraft in 1977 as a way to present Earth's life and culture to intelligent life beyond the solar system; real-life Carl Sagan was centrally involved in the creation of these discs.

Carl Sagan's likeness was approved by the late astronomer's estate.

“Carl's vision and philosophy has always been a huge inspiration,” Raphaël says. “We wanted to include him in this project.”

In fact, F&P got even more than they hoped for when they contacted the Sagan estate.

“When they saw what this project was, they not only were gracious enough to grant us the rights to his likeness, but they helped us put the words in his mouth,” Raphaël says. “These are the words of the closest people that you could possibly have interpret Carl. And they also assisted with the rest of the project, since this was infused at such a fundamental level by Carl's spirit.”

F&P ran through an extensive casting process to find a look-alike actor for the Sagan character, then used a few different VFX processes in postproduction to achieve the most realistic version they could. They compared the outputs with actual footage and recordings of Sagan to ensure accuracy.

The storyline and experience are impressive, and will surely enchant people across age groups. (Interstellar Arc is for ages 8 and up, and a single adult can supervise up to three children at once.) It's the underlying tech, however, that may position experiences like Interstellar Arc as a signal of VR's future.

At various points on our walk around Cosmopolis, it feels as though we're walking not just side to side, but also uphill and downhill.

In reality, we're still inside the same flat, 20,000-square-foot facility we started in. But as I step along the path, it truly feels like the terrain is sloped and curved; when others in my group get ahead of me, I have to look up or at slight angles to see them. It's a wild sensation, made all the more remarkable by the lack of any accompanying motion sickness (an issue I've dealt with in VR).

This is made possible by what Raphaël refers to as “redirection” of the headset's native visual processing features. The actual technical process is so complex that I still struggle to grasp it even after two extensively simplified breakdowns from Raphaël, but think of it like this: Felix & Paul are subtly rotating the headset's cameras to the side and upward slightly with each movement, creating a “cheat” for the eyes that makes it feel as though fellow participants are above or below one another when they're actually on flat ground. (One can only imagine the processing lift involved in maintaining this effect as dozens of participants move around simultaneously.)

Our brains can only handle so much of this, though. Initial versions of redirection included long segments of the effect at once, but that created issues.

The facility is 20,000 square feet, and the railings help guide you as you walk around inside.

“Let's say for 30 seconds you went in one direction [using the redirection effect],” Raphaël says. “The minute you would turn around to walk in the opposite direction, the cheat that we were doing in one direction is now happening in the other direction, but your brain is used to it being in the first direction. You'd feel very disoriented.”

Through 18 months of trial and error, F&P got around this problem in part by shortening the redirection windows. We only spent a brief amount of time walking on the sloped segments, plus moving on what Raphaël calls a “sinuous path” that includes an equal amount of left and right redirection.

I contacted Andy Etches, founder of VR company Rezzil, a major player in the sports VR space, to get his take on this headset innovation.

“That's the first I've heard of that approach anywhere,” says Etches. “You've seen people use treadmills and omnidirectional things, which feel like falling more than walking. Allowing someone to walk naturally and altering their perception of how they're walking or what they're seeing is a really interesting approach.”

Also notable is F&P's use of the physical space. Twenty thousand square feet isn't small—about the same as a midsize hotel ballroom—but visitors move quite a bit during the experience. Our headsets are equipped with a step counter; I managed over 500 in the hourlong experience, which for me is about a quarter-mile. I got a chance to view the space with my headset off, and it didn't quite feel big enough for that.

And it isn't. Raphaël tells me our group actually went around the room three full times as part of a “circuit,” facilitated by a combination of railings and strategic prompts—the fox, light-up visual cues—that kept us moving along a preset path.

“We now have a way to re-map physical space into dramatically different virtual space, which is great for using less physical space,” Raphaël says. “In the future you can imagine a world where companies or people have ‘holodecks' where they can experience entertainment or work or training or whatever you might want to do in a virtual environment. You will, using this type of technique, simply need less physical space than you normally would.”

This kind of spatial manipulation is part of VR's core value proposition, but the tech has often lacked proper vehicles to bring it to life. One can only make a living room feel so big in VR before the user runs into a wall.

The physical space presents other technical challenges. One is the volume of people: Interstellar Arc can accommodate up to 170 participants at once, Raphaël says, quite a crowd even in a room this large.

That can be an issue for typical VR headsets, which rely on cameras and sensors to triangulate their position within a room. Those devices lock onto fixed surfaces when you're alone, but it's much harder with more than 100 people roaming around. “You might start drifting in space and bouncing around, disappearing and reappearing somewhere else,” Raphaël says.

F&P uses an intriguing workaround that utilizes an additional camera built into the top of the headset that points upward at an infrared light grid spread across the entire room's ceiling. The grid functions almost as a “giant QR code,” as Raphaël puts it, helping each headset maintain its precise location by locking onto the unique pattern.

Etches says he's seen similar anti-latency approaches for large-scale VR programs, but typically using markings on the wall or floor.

The feature seems to work, at least in my limited experience. I never saw any drifting or bouncing around from any fellow group members, though in fairness there were nowhere near 170 people in the room at the time.

With new consumer VR headset models arriving each year and lighter, more nimble options on the horizon, Raphaël knows Interstellar Arc won't be able to rely on the same tech for long. He says F&P have already pushed the Quest 3S “as far as we possibly could,” and that the team will adapt the experience as new models arrive. “You have this technology that's just barely now getting to the point where it's good enough, very recently, and it still can get a lot better,” he says.

Etches believes VR has already been edging toward the mainstream in recent years. But he thinks experiences like Interstellar Arc will only fuel the fire by creating a perfect setting for fantasy, historic, or futuristic viewing experiences. “You can't do it any other way really, can you? Placing someone in a different place in time, without moving them, and doing it with 170 people at once,” he says.

The VR experience of Interstellar Arc isn't one that can be easily recreated at home. The team also hasn't announced plans to install the experience in other locations, so you have to go to Vegas to go through it. To Etches, though, attractions like these will help drive wider VR adoption, even for games played in the living room.

“My experience over the last nearly 10 years of working in VR is that the minute someone tries it, they go, ‘Oh, this is amazing,'” he says. “If they have an exciting experience and they get to do something they couldn't do in real life, they will absolutely go on and experience VR more again.”

“If we can find a factory that's going to put 170 people through an amazing experience every hour of the day, I'm all for it. Because that's just going to introduce more people and build more adoption.”

The giant confinement building encapsulating the Chernobyl nuclear reactor that exploded nearly 40 years ago is smooth and curved—built with scientific precision. Installed in 2016, the structure was designed to prevent the escape of radiation from the stricken reactor, which is also encased in a smaller concrete sarcophagus. The confinement enshrouds both reactor and sarcophagus and is so massive that if you placed the Statue of Liberty inside it at its center, her torch wouldn't come close to prodding the ceiling. But like a slightly cracked egg, this gargantuan covering has been violated. It is one of many victims in Russia's war with Ukraine.

In February, a drone armed with explosives smashed into the confinement, leaving a 15 m2 hole. While some of the damage has been repaired, the building's radiation-blocking abilities have been compromised, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed earlier this month. Importantly, the IAEA also said that radiation levels in the area have not yet changed. But unless more significant repairs are carried out, the specter of a potential leak remains.

Radiation occurs naturally everywhere. It is produced by food you eat, and even by tissues in your own body. Think of it like a grand carnival of subatomic particles—including neutrons, electrons, and photons—that whizz around, always in motion, always present. An invisible world that shadows the world we can see. But the carnival is always changing and, today, we are better positioned than ever to notice fluctuations in radiation that deviate from normal, background levels.

When disaster struck Chernobyl in 1986, a huge cloud of radioactive material spread across much of Europe. It was how the world found out about the accident—when radiation monitors in eastern Sweden detected unusual activity two days after the explosion. In the wake of Chernobyl, many countries including Austria and the UK, installed radiation detectors that constantly monitor for any uptick in radioactivity. Today, some radiation-monitoring networks are run by governments, and yet more are the work of volunteers and researchers. If another major radiation incident were ever to happen, the world would discover it very, very quickly.

“The pandemic I found very terrifying, because there's not an easy way of detecting the Covid virus,” says Kim Kearfott, professor of nuclear engineering and radiological sciences at the University of Michigan. “I can grab a detector and immediately detect radiation.” On the roof of her university building, Kearfott has an array of radiation sensors. She also has some in her lab. And in her lab's basement. And in another building nearby. You get the idea.

The project is largely an informal one, sparked by curiosity and an absence of easily accessible public data on environmental radiation levels. “We put [this] into place after the Fukushima nuclear accident,” she says, referring to the 2011 disaster in which a huge tsunami struck the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan, which ultimately resulted in the release of significant amounts of radiation into the atmosphere.

After Fukushima, Kearfott realized that she and her colleagues had no mechanism for monitoring radiation levels. There are monitoring systems all over the US, she says, but it's hard to get access to the measurements they gather. “The nuclear plants,” she says, “they don't like releasing their monitoring data.”

Kearfott's detectors have picked up occasional, minor fluctuations in background levels in recent years. Hospitals with radiation-emitting equipment, such as positron emission tomography scanners, sometimes release radioactive gases into the atmosphere. “We think we were actually detecting those gases,” says Kearfott.

Kearfott was far from the only one left yearning for environmental measurements of radiation in the wake of Fukushima. At the time, there was a run on detector devices. “There was no real-time monitoring. Most of the systems that were in place…were government, so they were behind closed doors,” says Sean Bonner, cofounder of environmental monitoring non-profit Safecast.

He and collaborators initially helped to design DIY radiation detectors that people could make at home, as well as an online platform that would publish data from these devices worldwide. Today, 14 years on, there are more than 5,000 detectors on the network, which supply information to Safecast's digital map of radiation levels.

In the early days, as volunteers trudged around the streets of Tokyo, say, taking readings, the Safecast team soon realized that radiation levels varied noticeably even within the same street. “We would see much higher levels in rains off gutters and things,” says Bonner.

Kearfott's measurements are also affected when the wind blows in certain directions. And rain and snowfall move radiation readings, too. In 2023, ambient gamma radiation levels in Hong Kong rose after heavy rainfall washed radioactive decay products of radon—a radioactive gas that naturally occurs in the Earth's crust—out of the air and brought those decay products down to ground level. Background radiation levels are typically measured in microsieverts per hour. In Hong Kong, they might usually sit around 0.1 microsieverts per hour, for instance. But the weather and other factors can push measurements around within a range of roughly 0.06 to 0.3.

And a paper published last year explained that, in northern Spain in 2009, powerful storms known locally as Galernas—which feature intense winds and sometimes heavy rainfall—had induced a spike in radon-related radiation big enough to trigger false alarms in the Basque Country gamma ray monitoring network.

Bonner says Safecast has also found instances of tides in coastal areas affecting background levels slightly, as waves alter the distribution of radioactive rocks on beaches.

Today, some countries, such as Poland, publish data from their national radiation-monitoring systems in near-real-time on the open web, and such data is also available for many nations via the European Commission. And at the offices of the IAEA in Austria, staff have access to their own monitoring data. “We have a big map of the world and the data appears on that map,” says Marion Damien, response data officer at the IAEA's Incident and Emergency Centre, explaining that staff at the organization and also authorities within dozens of member countries have access to this map on their computers. Data from member nations appears in near real time, arriving within minutes or after up to an hour or so, says Damien.

I ask what the map looks like on the day we speak, in early December. Everywhere is green, except Fukushima and Chernobyl, she says. Higher levels can be visualized in yellow, orange, or red—the latter indicating 1,000 microsieverts per hour, or more. This was the kind of radiation level measured at the Fukushima power plant during the height of the crisis in 2011.

“The wonderful thing about this map [is] it doesn't discriminate,” says Damien. “We will see [any radiation] that is more than a certain threshold.” She adds that fluctuations in background radiation, for instance those caused by weather events, are not generally significant enough to have an impact on the environment or people. Though it's worth noting that exposure to radon gas, which can enter buildings in some areas depending on local geology, is associated with lung cancer. Your exposure over time may be affected if you live in an area where radon is present and where permafrost is also currently melting due to climate change, for instance, since this can allow more radon gas to escape from the ground.

Most people are not aware of how much radiation monitoring goes on around them all the time, including in public places. Airports have sophisticated radiation detectors, for example. In 2022, devices at Heathrow flagged a package that turned out to contain a small amount of uranium. There was no risk to the public, authorities said at the time.

Mirion is one of several companies that make radiation detectors. Their products are used for defense and security applications, as well as in nuclear power plants, laboratories, and research contexts. “If there's an incident in a nuclear plant like a fuel leak…these systems are connected to the safety system of the nuclear plant, so the nuclear plant will shut down,” explains James Cocks, chief technology officer. Area monitors suck particulate emitted by power plants onto filter paper, which can be analyzed to see whether or not there has been an uncontrolled release of radiation.

The company even makes a radiation detector designed to fit to the underside of a drone. Cocks says that, in the immediate aftermath of Fukushima, such was the need to collect data on radiation that someone drove around on a motorbike with a radiation detector. Drones would, today, offer a safer way of gathering such information, he suggests.

But Mirion also makes handheld detectors that can be carried by personnel keeping an eye on major sports events, for example. And these can distinguish between different types of radiation. You want to be able to tell, for example, whether your higher-than-normal readings are coming from a dirty bomb—or just someone who recently had medical treatment involving a radioisotope. “We can identify whether it's background, naturally occurring radiation…whether it's a medical radioisotope or whether it's…a fission product,” says Cocks.

And so one legacy of the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters is that we now have hugely upgraded radiation-monitoring systems dotted around the world. There has been a marked increase in efforts to track radiation in the wake of those accidents, says Kearfott.

Bonner acknowledges that some people experience anxiety regarding radiation—now and again, a volunteer would build a Safecast detector, switch it on and “freak out” when it began detecting activity, he says. However, it is important to show how pervasive, and variable, background radiation really is, he says: “We absolutely believe that it's reassuring to let people know what's going on.”

A desktop PC? To some, it might sound like a quaint piece of retro tech, like a fax machine or landline. While advancements in laptops have replaced a lot of what made desktops necessary, they're far from out of the picture. Not only is the DIY PC-building scene as vibrant as ever, but prebuilt desktops and new designs are making these PCs cheaper and smaller. A laptop may serve most people well, but there are important reasons to consider a desktop instead. If you don't want to build your own PC, I've got you covered with these prebuilt options I've personally tested.

For more recommendations, read our Best Gaming Laptops, Best Apple Desktops, and Best All-In-Ones guides. You may also want to pair your desktop with accessories, so read our Best Ergonomic Mouse, Best Mechanical Keyboards, Best Monitors, Best Computer Speakers, Best USB Mics, and Best Webcam guides.

Why Buy a Prebuilt Desktop PC?

There are two main reasons to buy a traditional tower desktop instead of a laptop. First, you can achieve performance not possible on a laptop. For PC gamers, AI developers, content creators, and anyone else who uses the extra power, desktop PCs are still unbeatable in this regard. Even if you don't have a maxed-out system with an Nvidia RTX 5090, you'll still get more performance for the money you spend. This remains true on prebuilt desktop PCs as much as on DIY systems that you build yourself. However, with RAM prices escalating like crazy, if you don't need anything special in terms of performance, buying a laptop is a cheaper way to go—at least, for now.

Secondly, people buy desktop PCs for their upgradeability. Not only is it fun to tinker with the technology, but it's also a cost-saving measure that lets you replace parts piecemeal. You can choose when to replace a specific part, and there's a thriving aftermarket for old parts. This benefit only partially applies to prebuilt systems, as your ability to upgrade varies from system to system. Standard PC manufacturers use a mix of proprietary and off-the-shelf parts, which affects the long-term lifespan of the PC. Meanwhile, more expensive PCs built by boutique system integrators like Falcon Northwest, Origin, or iBuyPower use mostly off-the-shelf parts.

As a side note, some smaller PC manufacturers and system builders, like Minisforum and CyberPowerPC, have already started raising prices on desktops due to the memory shortage,  But many of the options we've listed below are still selling for normal prices, and based on what we're hearing, prices on all PCs in 2026 are going to eventually go up. That makes it a uniquely good time to buy a prebuilt.

What Are the Common Desktop PC Sizes?

These days, a desktop PC can be defined as any kind of computer that doesn't have a battery. It's not meant to be moved, and it can't be used on the go. Outside of that definition, desktop computers can range from tiny to massive, and they could even include PCs with built-in displays, which are called “all-in-one” computers. Here's a breakdown of the options:

Full tower: The biggest desktop PC size, most commonly for high-end gaming machines. There's no standardized measurement, but they are typically over 22 inches tall and deep. Most importantly, they are large enough internally to support E-ATX motherboards and more extensive cooling setups.

Mid tower: These days, this is the most common desktop PC size. Whether for gaming or work, it's the size with the most versatility, with enough room to get some decent performance while still allowing for easily upgradable parts. Most PCs you buy will use a mid-tower case.

Small form factor (SFF): This size has grown in popularity in the DIY space, but it's still uncommon in prebuilt PCs, though you'll find some options out there, such as the Corsair One or some of the options listed below. These cases exclusively use smaller Mini-ITX motherboards, designed to fit into these miniature cases, while still allowing you to get in and upgrade parts.

Mini PC: These are the smallest PCs you can buy. They aren't designed to be upgraded yourself, relying on laptop components to fit into such a small package. They're sometimes used in living rooms or server rooms due to their size.

All-in-one: These are desktop PCs that include the entire package all in one, including the display. Typically, they use laptop components packed into either the display or the base of the computer.

What to Look for in a Desktop Computer

When people typically think of the phrase “desktop computer,” they think of the traditional, large tower that sits on your desk (or on your floor). That's certainly an important segment of what's out there, and if that's what you're shopping for, the basic specs as configured are important. Here are the important specs to consider.

If you're new to the world of desktop PCs, that might sound like a long list of specs to check. In the end, it all comes down to what your needs are. Most desktop PCs are used for gaming these days, which is why so many are oriented toward flashy lights and powerful GPUs. But regardless of what you need your desktop PC for, you'll want a minimum of 16 GB of RAM, though you might want to upgrade to 32 GB or 64 GB for gaming and content creation machines. The latest version of memory is DDR5.

Like all computers, what you're looking for in a prebuilt desktop is a balance of design, performance, and price. If you want to game, you'd better get yourself a decent graphics card to start with and a system with some solid cooling. But another really important aspect about a desktop computer is its upgradability. How comfortable are you with upgrading your PC yourself? It's worth taking some time to watch a few how-to videos and familiarize yourself with the components so you can save money over time.

How We Test Desktop PCs

All the desktop PCs we've tested have been sent to us for review, but we adhere to strict ethics and neutrality. When we get a desktop PC to test, we pay careful attention to the build quality of the case, especially in how it's delivered. These are large electronics with lots of movable parts that can easily be damaged during delivery. Prebuilts often have to use internal brackets to keep key elements like the GPU stable for shipping. Some even ship with the graphics card uninstalled.

Once we get the PC set up, we take off the side panels and begin inspecting the internal setup. We take note of how easy it is to replace, pay attention to how cleanly the cables are routed and organized, ensuring that all the components are connected correctly. From there, we start benchmarking performance in a variety of tests, including 3DMark, Cinebench, Geekbench, and Pugetbench, as well as games like Cyberpunk 2077, Black Myth: Wukong, Marvel Rivals, and more. Measuring performance is more than just about reporting frame rates, too; observing CPU temperatures, frequency, and fan noise carefully. The whole point is to get a good sense for how the desktop will perform across a variety of tasks.

Lastly, we consider the upgrade path as part of our testing, seeing how easy it is to remove the GPU and other important components. As noted above, most people buy a prebuilt desktop with hopes of upgrading it in the future, and that always has to be part of our consideration when testing a desktop.

There's a lot to like about the Dell Tower Plus (7/10, WIRED Recommends), starting with its design. It's simple, really, but when it comes to a monolith sitting on (or below) your desk, you don't want anything too distracting. If you like the idea of a mixed-use home office computer, the Dell Tower Plus is your best option.

The primary downside to the Dell Tower Plus is its limited upgradability. The use of some proprietary parts, such as the motherboard and power supply, means they can't be easily replaced on your own. You can, however, upgrade simpler parts like the GPU, memory, and storage. You can add extra fans, swap out the CPU cooler, and more. This is more or less in line with prebuilt PCs from HP and Lenovo, though in the world of non-gaming, Dell offers the most compelling option for mainstream use in home offices.

There's still nothing quite like the Mac Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It remains the cheapest way to get into the Apple ecosystem, with the latest models starting at prices under $500 when on sale. This gets you 16 GB of RAM, 256 GB of storage, and an Apple M4 chip. Compared to many of the Mini PCs you can buy on the Windows side, the Mac Mini is in another league in terms of performance and price. You can even upgrade to the M4 Pro to turn it into a true powerhouse machine, though that costs an extra $800. The appeal of the Mac Mini is strongest as a budget option, though.

While most people will happily spend $250 extra for the versatility of the M4 MacBook Air, you can't deny the incredible performance you get at this price and size. The Mac mini does have a fan, but it remains extremely quiet on your desk.

The Asus TUF T500 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) pairs up a laptop motherboard and CPU with a full-sized desktop GPU, giving you a better upgrade path, while only sacrificing a little bit of power. This svelte and attractive gaming desktop does a surprisingly good job managing its heat and noise, despite limited intake options and only a small fan in the rear. You're stuck with the CPU, motherboard, and power supply that come installed, so there are some limitations as you look at upgrading down the line.

The version I checked out was equipped with an RTX 5060 Ti, 16 GB of RAM, and a 1-TB PCIe SSD. While it's about the lowest I'd spec out for a new system for serious gaming, it's very capable at 1080p, and can even manage 1440p in some games if you tweak the settings a bit. I put together a similar desktop from parts for comparison, and you're really only spending a few hundred dollars for Asus to assemble and test your system. That's a good compromise for space-conscious or tech-averse gamers looking to just sit down and play. —Brad Bourque

The Alienware Aurora Gaming Desktop (7/10, WIRED Recommends) shares a lot in common with the Dell Tower Plus. It's a spruced-up version with some Alienware branding and extra performance. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though. I really like the loop of light on the front of the case and the custom water block on the liquid cooling, both of which add a new splash of customizable light to the setup.

More importantly, you can configure it with up to an RTX 5080, 64 GB of RAM, and 8 TB of storage. But the point is not necessarily to configure it this powerfully when you buy it, as these are all components you can upgrade yourself in the future, probably for cheaper. The only thing that can't be easily upgraded is the motherboard and power supply. And because this uses an Intel CPU, it probably can't be upgraded either, as it would need a new motherboard. That's not great, but it's also true of options such as the HP Omen 35L and Lenovo Legion Tower.

It's certainly true that the M4 iMac (9/10, WIRED Recommends) that exists today doesn't occupy the same space of reverence it once did. But that's not because the iMac that Apple sells isn't good on its own terms. It's incredibly fast, high-end, and—dare I say—fun, thanks to its color options. The design is genius: Apple built the computer into the bottom bezel, which allows the display to look super sleek.

The small, 25-inch screen is the main thing holding it back, as 27-inch monitors have become the standard, especially for creatives and office workers, who the iMac is for. The difference in size is even more noticeable if you're coming from something larger, like a 32-inch monitor. But for the right person, the iMac is exactly what you want. No fuss. No cables. No need to choose a monitor. It's as clean a desktop setup as you can get, and that's exactly what some people are looking for.

Framework

Framework

Framework's first entry into the world of desktops is an unabashed success (7/10, WIRED Recommends). I'm not terribly surprised, as the company has earned itself a reputation in the world of sustainability and upgradability. This Mini-ITX, 4.5-liter case feels tiny for what it can do and for how much access to the components it provides.

These small form factor prebuilt PCs are still fairly uncommon as a middle ground between Mini PCs and Mid-Towers. The key is the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395, a convoluted name for a very unique chip, which has integrated graphics as powerful as an RTX 4060 in a gaming laptop. That might not knock your socks off in gaming performance, but for its size, I was still impressed. And like Framework Laptops, you can replace the Mainboard with relative ease—so long as AMD brings out a more powerful version in the future. Unfortunately, that means you can't upgrade the RAM separately from the mainboard.

While other desktop Macs have to compete with MacBooks, the Mac Studio is the one Apple desktop with a unique proposition: the M3 Ultra. That massive, overpowered chip is only offered on the Mac Studio. Even the Mac Pro is stuck on the M2 Ultra (and will reportedly not get refreshed in the future). With up to 28 CPU cores and 60 GPU cores, the M3 Ultra is the most powerful chip Apple has ever made, a considerable step up above the M4 Max, especially in terms of GPU performance. It's absolutely insane how much performance Apple has squeezed into this tiny machine. To be fair, that level of performance (and price) makes it a niche computer. But when you need raw power, it's great that Mac users now have an option that competes with even the most powerful Windows desktops.

While I'm a mattress and sleep product expert, thanks to years of hands-on experience, I'm also aware that my opinion is not the end-all, be-all for everyone. However, when a megastar is also a fan of a product you've reviewed, it's a good confirmation that you're on the right track.

Taylor Swift, as it would turn out, is also a fan of Coop Sleep Goods—which we can confirm based on this December 10 Late Show With Stephen Colbert appearance.



Coop's got some of our favorite pillows, particularly the Original Adjustable pillow. It comes in three shapes: the Crescent, the Cut Out, and the Classic, which is a traditional rectangular shape. I love (and regularly sleep on) the Crescent, which has a gentle curve on the bottom to allow for movement while maintaining head and neck support.

WIRED reviewer Nena Farrell likes the Cut Out, which features a notchlike shape in the center. This is another standout option for side sleepers, as your shoulder is meant to go into this opening while the pillow boosts the head and neck, maintaining cervical alignment.

The standard cover that comes on all three iterations is impressively soft. Each pillow comes with extra fill, which you can add by unzipping the cover and inner shell. Adding more fill makes the pillow feel firmer, but you can also remove some to make it softer.

Coop's flash deal won't last long—you only have until December 17 to get 22 percent off all Coop pillows with the code TAYLOR22. So, whether you consider yourself a true Swiftie or not, these really are awesome pillows (not to mention a terrific deal).

For most people, and it's completely understandable, Nvidia is still shorthand for GPUs and AI chips. The company's silicon dominates the AI data center conversation and headlines.

But Nvidia's real “moat,” and I use that word purposefully, is the combination of its silicon offerings with an increasingly deep software stack. Stated a bit differently, Nvidia has built an end-to-end AI platform that includes:

Now, the Nemotron family of open models turns raw compute into usable intelligence. This is a big deal. Nemotron 3 is the latest expression of that strategy, and it matters as much for Nvidia's long-term AI position as any new GPU launch.

Nvidia likes to remind the market that frontier models do not live on hardware alone. In its recent blog on OpenAI's GPT-5.2, the company stressed that leading models depend on “world-class accelerators, advanced networking, and a fully optimized software stack.”

Nvidia's GB200 and Blackwell may get the glamour shots, but it's software that makes tens of thousands of GPUs behave like a single, coherent AI supercomputer.

Nemotron sits right in that layer, between infrastructure and applications. It started as a way to seed the open-source ecosystem with strong, reasonably efficient models.

On an industry analyst call, Nvidia VP of Generative AI Software for Enterprise, Kari Briski, framed the motivation very simply.

Open models accelerate innovation because they let “researchers everywhere build on shared knowledge” and allow anyone, not just big tech, to fine-tune systems for their own domains.

In 2025, Nvidia was the top contributor of open models and datasets on Hugging Face, with roughly 650 models and 250 datasets. This point is relevant because it shows Nvidia is not just selling GPUs: it is actively seeding the open ecosystem with high-quality building blocks, which draws researchers, startups, and enterprises into its software orbit and makes Nvidia's platform the default place where new AI work gets done.

In that sense, Nemotron is evolving into a brand that organizes those contributions into a roadmap rather than a grab bag. The Nemotron 3 announcement establishes the point where that roadmap becomes much more ambitious. Briski described it as “the most efficient family of open models with leading accuracy for building agentic AI applications.”

The flagship announcement is Nemotron 3 Nano, a roughly 30-plus-billion-parameter mixture-of-experts model with only about 3–4 billion parameters active per token. That architecture gives it the compute footprint of a “tiny” model while allowing it to compete on reasoning quality with much larger, dense systems.

Under the hood, Nemotron 3 combines three ideas that have become central to modern reasoning models.

First is a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture that combines attention layers with state-space sequence modeling to reduce memory and compute, especially for long context.

Second is a mixture-of-experts layout that activates only a small subset of parameters for each token.

Third is a context window that spans approximately one million tokens, enabling the model to operate across entire codebases, long technical specifications, and multi-day conversations in a single pass.

Because the new scaling law is no longer just “more GPUs, bigger pre-train.” Briski notes that there are now three levers: “pretraining, post-training, and what we call long thinking.”

Long thinking means test-time compute and self-reflection, often with multiple agents collaborating.

That drives token usage, and, by extension, inference cost, through the roof.

Nemotron 3's selling point is that it provides deeper reasoning at a much better tokens-to-accuracy ratio than previous open models.

There's more to the story. Nvidia is releasing Nemotron 3 together with the exact reinforcement learning (RL) “gyms,” data, and libraries it used internally.

Briski emphasized that “Nvidia is the first to release open state-of-the-art…RL environments alongside our open models, libraries, and data.”

Ten initial gym environments cover topics such as competitive coding, math, and practical scheduling.

They let enterprises replicate Nvidia's own training loop — simulate agents in realistic environments, score their behavior, and feed that back into the model.

For teams that might otherwise spend months building custom RL infrastructure, that is a significant accelerator.

On the data side, Nemotron 3 rides on what Nvidia calls a shift from “big data” to “smart and improved data.”

The company is releasing new pre-training bodies that are synthetically cleaned and rewritten, representing more than 10 trillion tokens of higher-quality text, plus an 18-million-example instruction-tuning set built from permissively licensed models.

Nvidia claims more than a million H100 hours went into generating and curating this data.

The result, according to Briski, is a 40% increase in an independent “intelligence index” score from Nemotron Nano 2 to Nemotron 3, with particular gains in instruction-following and conciseness.

Nemotron also comes packaged in what Nvidia calls “blueprints.” These are reference agent stacks for deep research assistants, video search and summarization, and highly optimized enterprise retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines that show how the models, embeddings, multimodal ingestion, and retrieval components fit together.

For a CIO, that matters more than a benchmark chart. It turns Nemotron from a research artifact into a template you can deploy across your own data, on your own clusters, or your favorite cloud.

All of this lines up neatly with Nvidia's full-stack pitch. The company already powers the bulk of frontier model training, from OpenAI's GPT-5.2 to video generators like Runway Gen-4.5, on platforms ranging from Hopper to GB200 and Blackwell.

Its GPUs lead every MLPerf Training category, and Blackwell systems are now available as standard options on AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Oracle, and others.

Nemotron 3 provides that infrastructure with a “house model” and toolchain that are tightly tuned to Nvidia silicon, networking, and compilers.

So, does Nemotron 3 keep Nvidia safely in front of AMD and the rest of the pack?

It certainly strengthens the company's position. On the hardware side, AMD has emerged as a major player in AI silicon over the past few years. Its Instinct MI300 and newer MI350 series accelerators, backed by the ROCm open software stack, now run LLMs such as Llama-3 at leading cloud providers and, on some workloads, deliver competitive or better inference economics.

Moreover, AMD is also rolling out full-rack Helios and MI450-class systems to challenge Nvidia's rack-scale offerings.

Where Nemotron 3 differentiates Nvidia is in the depth and openness of the model-plus-tool ecosystem that runs on its chips.

Of course, AMD has ROCm, strong compiler work, and growing model support. Still, it does not yet offer an equivalent, integrated package of open models, RL gyms, curated data, and deployment blueprints under a single brand.

For enterprises trying to build “systems of models” and agentic workflows, that kind of dogmatic but open toolkit is extremely attractive.

It reduces time-to-value and subtly locks you into Nvidia's way of doing things.

However, Nemotron 3 is not a permanent moat. The architectures it uses — hybrid Mamba-Transformer layers, mixture-of-experts, long context, and RL-driven reasoning — are increasingly well understood in the broader research community.

Of course, nothing prevents AMD or others from training similar open models and tuning them for their own accelerators. Furthermore, because Nemotron is open-weight, in theory, it can run on non-Nvidia hardware, such as ROCm and other mature stacks, even if you lose some of Nvidia's end-to-end optimization.

The right way to view Nemotron 3, then, is as another turn of Nvidia's flywheel rather than a single knockout punch. It makes the company's GPUs more valuable by giving developers efficient, transparent models designed for agentic AI.

It makes its software platform more compelling by bundling the libraries, RL environments, and data needed to specialize those models.

Also, it aligns Nvidia even more closely with the open-source AI community, which now drives much of the innovation in tools and agents.

But will that be enough to keep Nvidia ahead as the AI data center market explodes? In the near term, I believe the answer is yes.

Nemotron 3 raises the bar for what “open” and “enterprise-ready” look like in model land, and it does so in a way that plays to Nvidia's strengths.

Over the longer term, its real impact may be cultural rather than technical.

By committing to a Nemotron roadmap, putting its own training recipes in the open, and treating models as libraries you version and ship, Nvidia is trying to define how serious AI software should be built.

For customers deciding where to place their own multi-billion-dollar bets on AI infrastructure, that story is every bit as imperative as raw TOPS.

Tukwila, Wash.-based Starfish Space and California-based Impulse Space say they've successfully demonstrated an in-space satellite rendezvous during a mission that handed over control of an Impulse Mira spacecraft to Starfish's guidance and navigation system.

The demonstration was code-named Remora, in honor of a fish that attaches itself to other marine animals. Operation Remora was added to Mira's agenda for Impulse Space's LEO Express 2 mission, which was launched in January. Impulse and Starfish waited until the Mira spacecraft completed its primary satellite deployment tasks for LEO Express 2. Then they spent several weeks monitoring the maneuvers for Remora.

“About a month ago, we concluded the major steps here,” Starfish co-founder Trevor Bennett told GeekWire. “Since then, we've been getting data down and understanding the full story. And the full story is incredible.”

Remora was kept under wraps until today, primarily because both companies wanted to make sure that the demonstration actually worked as planned. “There was never a guarantee that there would be an outcome here,” Bennett explained. “And so what we wanted to do is talk about it when there was something to talk about.”

Bennett said the demonstration showed that Starfish's software suite for guidance, navigation and control could be used on a different company's satellite to make an autonomous approach to another spacecraft in orbit.

“Remora became definitely a first for us, in terms of being able to allow a whole new vehicle platform to autonomously do this full mission, all the way in and through,” he said. “Basically, we had no operator commands necessary for the vehicle to fly itself all the way down to 1,200 meters, take a bunch of pictures and then autonomously egress back out to further distances.”

Before launch, the LEO Express 2 Mira was equipped with a peripheral flight computer that was loaded with Starfish's Cetacean and Cephalopod software. During the Remora mission, that Mira spacecraft used Starfish's guidance system and a single lightweight camera system supplied by TRL11 to close in on a different Mira that had been used for Impulse Space's LEO Express 1 mission.

As the distance decreased from about 100 kilometers (62 miles) to roughly 1,200 meters (three-quarters of a mile), Starfish's software processed the camera imagery to generate estimates of relative position. Then it computed optimal orbital trajectories and commanded Mira's thrusters to fire accordingly.

Starfish is working on an in-house spacecraft called Otter that will be capable of approaching and docking with other objects in orbit to conduct inspections, perform orbital servicing or get rid of space debris. Bennett said the success of the Remora mission could open up new market opportunities that don't depend on Otter.

“What we're trying to show is that you don't have to design a vehicle just for RPO [rendezvous and proximity operations] and docking,” Bennett said. “You can design the vehicle for the core mission that it needs to do in addition to that. … What we're trying to do is remove this high barrier to having RPO and docking be a mainstay in our industry.”

Eric Romo, president and chief operating officer of Impulse Space, said Remora was a plus for his company as well. 

“Our Mira spacecraft uses high-thrust chemical propulsion, and what that means is, we're typically pretty good at moving really quickly between two points in space,” he told GeekWire. But Romo said some potential customers have wondered whether Mira's high-thrust system had the precision and accuracy that would be required when operating near another spacecraft.

For those customers, the Remora mission showed that there's no trade-off between speed and accuracy, and that Mira “has the commandability and the controllability you need to do this type of proximity operation,” Romo said.

Bennett and Romo both said their companies would look at future opportunities for collaboration. “For us, the path forward is to pull it away from just a pure demonstration mission to a truly day-to-day capability that we rely on and build on,” Bennett said. “We're very fortunate that Impulse was our partner up to this point, and I think there are plenty of opportunities for us to be partners going forward.”

In the meantime, both companies are busy with other projects. Starfish Space is in the midst of an Otter Pup 2 test mission that was launched in June — and the company has its first three full-scale Otter missions lined up for NASA, the U.S. Space Force and the SES satellite company (which acquired Intelsat) in the 2026-2027 time frame.

Impulse Space's third Mira spacecraft was launched last month to deploy and host payloads for the LEO Express 3 mission. Looking ahead, Impulse is pursuing a partnership with Anduril to conduct a high-precision rendezvous and proximity operations mission in geosynchronous Earth orbit in 2026. And looking even further ahead, the company has laid out a roadmap for sending medium-sized payloads to the moon.

[Editor's Note: Agents of Transformation is an independent GeekWire series and 2026 event, underwritten by Accenture, exploring the people, companies, and ideas behind the rise of AI agents.]

Imagine telling your AI assistant that you need a new winter jacket. It already knows your style preferences and budget from previous purchases. The AI searches across dozens of retailers, analyzes reviews, checks for sales, and comes back with a list of ranked options. 

You pick one you like. The AI asks if you want to wait until the price drops. A week later, there's a sale. The AI completes the purchase, applies loyalty points, selects the fastest free shipping option, and sends you a confirmation. Your jacket shows up within days.

This is the promise of “agentic commerce” — AI systems that research, compare, and even buy on your behalf. Tech giants, startups, and retailers are all racing to build it. McKinsey projects the market could reach $1 trillion in the U.S. alone by 2030.

For the latest installment in our Agents of Transformation series, we interviewed startup founders, consumer brand marketing leaders, industry analysts, and others to better understand how agentic commerce could change the way we shop — now, in the future, or maybe not much at all.

Some key takeaways from our reporting:

Major players are making moves. 

Adobe reported that AI-driven traffic to U.S. retail sites jumped 670% year-over-year on Cyber Monday.

But it's still early days. For ChatGPT, referrals to e-commerce apps represented only 0.82% of all sessions over Thanksgiving weekend. In a recent OpenAI study of about 1.1 million ChatGPT conversations, 2.1% of activity was classified as “Purchasable Products.”

There's still a big gap between the pitch and what these tools can actually do today. Practical use cases remain limited.

“I am shocked at the promises versus reality,” said Emily Pfeiffer, a principal analyst and digital business expert with Forrester.

Still, the builders we spoke with see the current moment as the beginning of a fundamental shift.

“I think this is much bigger than even the invention of the online store,” said Jonathan Arena, co-founder of e-commerce AI startup New Generation.

McKinsey outlines three main ways agentic commerce could work:

Today's reality is closer to a fancy search than full autonomy. AI chatbots can suggest products, but completing a purchase still typically requires clicking through to a retailer's site. A handful of retailers have experimented with checkout-in-chat, but Pfeiffer said some polished demos don't actually work in the real world.

“The experiences that are out there today, in my opinion, are extremely premature,” she said.

There's also a broader debate about whether AI shopping assistants are solving a problem that doesn't exist for specific purchase categories. For fashion, gifts, home decor — things where discovery is part of the value — many consumers may not want an agent to shortcut that process.

Agentic commerce could work best for low-consideration, commodity purchases — like household staples and replenishment items.

The concept becomes more complex outside of a brand's own site or app, in AI search tools where an agent might eventually handle the entire shopping process without a user ever opening a retailer's website. Pfeiffer believes this is where truly autonomous commerce is most likely to show up, though probably in specific situations rather than as a full replacement for browsing.

But she said any substantial shifts will take time. “If we get there, it's not soon,” Pfeiffer said.

Agentic commerce isn't possible without the right infrastructure. E-commerce websites were designed for humans typing keywords into a browser — not AI agents that need to read pages and place orders on their own.

New tools are starting to fill that gap.

For retailers, this patchwork can be confusing and expensive, especially as there's no guarantee which protocol will become dominant.

“Each protocol is a burden for the merchant,” said Kumar Senthil, founder of Firmly, a Seattle-area startup building software that hides some of this complexity. His company, which recently partnered with Perplexity, lets merchants connect to multiple protocols through a single interface.

Firmly is trying to solve a basic problem: merchants can't afford to integrate with every AI platform, but they also don't want to miss out on any of them.

Senthil, who previously built Samsung's e-commerce platform, said online retailers need to have “microstores” everywhere. Their traditional websites, he predicts, will go dark.

“The stores are going to be distributed across the internet,” he said.

But AI assistants need to draw on data from somewhere — which means a brand's homepage could still serve an important purpose, even if the act of purchasing gets dispersed.

Brands like Brooks Running are refocusing their sites to make them easy for AI systems to read and understand. “We're continuing to emphasize crawling, indexing, and ranking technical SEO opportunities through the lens of AI,” said Ryan Ngo, vice president of North America marketing and e-commerce at the Seattle-based company.

Beyond making a website “AI-ready,” Arena said brands should let shoppers ask questions about their products in plain language, using built-in AI chat on their own sites. “People are going to be frustrated that your website can't answer them,” he said.

In Pfeiffer's view, the bigger strategic risk lies in places brands don't control — AI-powered search tools like ChatGPT or Gemini that could become powerful new gateways for finding and buying products. In that world, brands face the same decisions they once confronted with Amazon: what to share in each place people might shop, what to keep exclusive, and how to protect pricing and sensitive data.

Amazon helped shape modern online shopping when the Seattle-based giant started selling books on the internet more than three decades ago. The company is now a giant in online retail, and it's staring at another potential shift with the rise of agentic commerce.

Amazon is in a tricky spot. The company captures roughly 40% of U.S. e-commerce spending and has a fast-growing advertising business that brings in around $70 billion a year — revenue that depends on humans browsing and clicking.

In November, Amazon sued Perplexity to stop the startup from using its AI browser agent to make purchases on its marketplace, citing computer fraud laws and security risks, along with a “significantly degraded shopping and customer service experience it provides.” Amazon has maintained what Bloomberg described as “a walled garden” that doesn't allow autonomous shopping on its site.

Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas called the lawsuit “a bully tactic” and argued consumers should be free to use whatever AI assistant they prefer. 

“Amazon should love this. Easier shopping means more transactions and happier customers,” Srinivas wrote. “But Amazon doesn't care. They're more interested in serving you ads, sponsored results, and influencing your purchasing decisions with upsells and confusing offers.”

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged on a recent earnings call that agentic commerce “has a chance to be really good for e-commerce” and said that he expects the company to partner with third-party agents over time. But he also said agents “aren't very good” at personalization and often display incorrect pricing and delivery estimates. 

“So we've got to find a way to make the customer experience better and have the right exchange value,” Jassy said. 

Amazon's AI shopping assistant, Rufus, now has more than 250 million active customers. Amazon says that customers using the assistant during a shopping trip are 60% more likely to complete a purchase.

The company has also been testing a “Buy For Me” feature that lets customers purchase products from other brands' sites, from inside Amazon's mobile shopping app.

Senthil, the Firmly CEO, sees Amazon as potentially vulnerable. He questioned whether Amazon's delivery speed advantage — long considered a competitive moat — will matter as much in a world where consumers place less emphasis on faster shipping times. 

The rise of third-party AI agents, such as Perplexity's Comet browser, could also weaken Amazon's grip on customers. E-commerce journalist Jason Del Rey noted that if agents own the relationship and steer shoppers across sites, Amazon risks looking more like fulfillment infrastructure. That raises a long-term question, he said — if agents sit between shoppers and stores, who ends up capturing most of the value?

But others don't expect AI tools to displace Amazon for now.

“It is highly unlikely that ChatGPT will be a dominant shopping cart mainly because e-commerce isn't a problem that needs fixed,” said Sucharita Kodali, a retail industry analyst with Forrester. “It's perfectly easy to buy on Amazon as hundreds of millions of people around the world already do every year.” 

Kodali added: “It's unclear what value ChatGPT is bringing to retailers, other than dis-intermediating Google.” 

Last month Google unveiled a suite of AI shopping features powered by Gemini, including “agentic checkout,” which lets users set rules such as maximum spend or product specifications. It's also building the infrastructure layer with AP2.

Microsoft, meanwhile, is positioning itself to help retailers and brands adapt to agentic commerce, whether building assistants into their websites or surfacing their offerings in third-party chatbots.

“We prioritize robust frameworks, open standards, and trust infrastructure so intelligent agents can operate reliably and securely throughout the commerce ecosystem,” said Kathleen Mitford, corporate vice president of global industry at Microsoft, responding to questions via email.

Finding the perfect winter coat based on your personal preferences may be just the start when it comes to AI assistants knowing what to purchase for you.

“Imagine an agent recognizing that the bathing suit you're buying isn't just another item, but part of preparing for an upcoming vacation and tailoring recommendations accordingly,” Mitford said. 

That example would require consumers to offer up more personal data such as calendars and budget information. But it could enable a better experience, according to Arena. 

“We're talking about a brand being able to personalize experiences to all of their customers across the internet — not only on a first-party website that they own,” he said. 

John Larson, who helped launch business messaging company Zipwhip (acquired by Twilio), said conversational commerce is evolving toward two-way interactions, enabling retailers to have more effective interactions with customers.

“We do believe that real conversational commerce leveraging agentic AI is absolutely the future,”  said Larson, now an investor in Seattle startup Ambassador. “You're getting your needs met, and you're having a conversation.”

Lorrin Pascoe, CMO at Vancouver, B.C.-based footwear retailer Vessi, said he believes AI agents will become an important way to reach customers. “For us, it's really realizing that this isn't a gimmick,” he said. “It is something that is foundational in changing behaviors.”

Vessi began in 2018 as an online-only footwear company. This month, it's opening its first U.S. store in Bellevue, Wash. — reversing the course that brick-and-mortar retailers took when e-commerce pushed them online. It's a reminder that retail rarely follows a predictable path, and in the same way, there's no telling where agentic commerce will ultimately land.

Lidar company Luminar has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after months of layoffs, executive departures, and a legal fight with its largest customer, Volvo. 

The company aims to sell off its lidar business during the bankruptcy proceeding, and has already reached a deal to sell its semiconductor subsidiary. While the company will continue to operate during the bankruptcy process to “minimize disruptions” for its suppliers and customers, Luminar will eventually cease to exist once it's completed.

“After a comprehensive review of our alternatives, the board determined that a court-supervised sale process is the best path forward,” Paul Ricci, Luminar's CEO said in a statement. “As we navigate this process, our top priority is to continue delivering the same quality, reliability and service our customers have come to expect from us.”

The bankruptcy case, filed in the Southern District of Texas on Monday morning, comes at the end of a tumultuous year for a company that was valued at more than $3 billion when it went public in a reverse merger in 2020. 

Luminar founder Austin Russell abruptly resigned from the CEO role in May following a “code of business conduct and ethics inquiry,” though he remained on the company's board. In October, he launched a new effort called Russell AI Labs and made a bid to buy Luminar outright. (It's unclear if Russell plans to pursue the lidar assets in the bankruptcy case; representatives for the former CEO did not immediately respond to requests for comment.) 

The company, meanwhile, cut 25% of its workforce — its second layoff of the year. Luminar's chief financial officer left the company, the company defaulted on a number of loans, and the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation. 

Luminar was also hit with an eviction lawsuit in October at one office and it exited a lease on another in November.

Another big blow came in November when Volvo, an early backer of Luminar and its largest customer heading into this year, canceled a five-year-old contract with the lidar-maker. Luminar said it has taken legal action against Volvo over the dissolution, but it has also been hit with its own legal claim from the contract manufacturer that actually made the lidar sensors. 

Luminar is claiming to have between $100 million and $500 million in assets and between $500 million and $1 billion in liabilities, according to the bankruptcy filings. Among those liabilities is a $10 million debt owed to Scale AI, which was helping Luminar with data labeling. Luminar also owes more than $1 million to AI software company Applied Intuition.

RIP to Facebook Messenger's desktop app. The native app for Mac and Windows is no longer available to users as of today, December 15, 2025, and existing users are being directed to the Facebook website to continue using the popular messaging service.

Though originally launched at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, Messenger's desktop app couldn't handle as many video call participants as business-focused rivals like Zoom, didn't offer screensharing, or easy-to-share URLs.

The writing was on the wall for the app's declining importance to Meta, even before the company announced its shutdown plans this October.

In 2023, Facebook began merging Messenger back into the Facebook app. 

More recently, the company shifted the technology underpinning the app's desktop version. According to Meta's help documentation, Messenger for Mac was built with Catalyst, which lets developers bring iPad apps to the Mac. That technology has received criticism for both developers and users — developers cited the extra work required, while users noticed apps' lack of a native feel.

Before its Catalyst version, the Mac app was an Electron app that later migrated to a React Native Desktop app, according to a former Meta software engineer. 

On Windows, the app transitioned to a progressive web app last year.

The downgrades likely impacted user demand for a standalone Mac app, while the strategy of moving Messenger back to Facebook suggested Meta was attempting to shore up declining usage of its aging flagship social network. 

This fall, the company warned users that Messenger's desktop app would be deprecated by year end, and encouraged users to set up a PIN to save their chat history before moving to the web.

People who use Messenger without a Facebook account are being redirected to Messenger.com after the shutdown, where they'll be able to log in without creating a Facebook account.

More information for users about the transition is available on Facebook's help center, with separate sections for Mac users and Windows users.

Snapchat announced on Monday that its end-of-year Recaps are rolling out to users, giving them a look back at 2025. The Recap is a short video that offers a personalized look at highlights from Snaps, Stories, and Chats, showing how users connected and expressed themselves throughout the year.

Users can access their Recap by opening the app and navigating to the “Memories” section. There, they will see a “Your 2025 Snap Recap” card.

The move comes as companies like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and Duolingo have all released their own end-of-year recaps.

Alongside the Recaps, Snapchat shared statistics on how people used the social media app over the past year. For example, the company says phone calls aren't dead, noting that users talked for nearly 1.7 billion minutes per day on average, almost 30% more than last year. Plus, users in the U.S. sent over five billion voice notes, nearly 10% more than last year.

Group chats still remain a popular way to connect on Snapchat, as the number of people sending messages to group chats grew by more than 5% in 2025, and some users sent more than 8,880 messages to their top group chat this year.

The company also revealed that Chat Reactions grew by 44% this year, with the heart emoji taking the crown as the most popular. Additionally, three million more people also used stickers to communicate this year.

The launch of Snap's 2025 Recap arrives amid user backlash over the company's plans to charge for storage next year, with some calling for a boycott to urge the company to change its mind. Snapchat announced in September that free access to Memories will be limited to 5GB. If a user's memories exceed this limit, they'll need to subscribe to one of the service's new Memories Storage plans.

The introductory storage plan offers up to 100GB of storage for $1.99 per month. Snapchat+ users will get up to 250GB of storage as part of their $3.99 monthly subscription, while Snapchat Platinum users will get 5TB as part of their $15.99 monthly subscription.

After successfully lobbying the Trump administration to approve the sale of its H200 chips to China, Nvidia is now thinking of ramping up production of the chips as Chinese companies rush to place orders, Reuters reported, citing anonymous sources.

The most powerful of Nvidia's previous Hopper generation of graphics processing units (GPUs) made for training large language models, the H200 chips previously could not be sold in China, as the previous Biden administration had proposed rules limiting sales of advanced AI chips in the country. But the Department of Commerce last week gave Nvidia the nod to sell H200 GPUs in China, in exchange for a 25% cut of sales of those chips. 

Nvidia is now seeing such strong demand from Chinese companies that it is considering adding more capacity, Reuters reported. However, Chinese officials are still deciding whether to allow the import of the H200 chips, which are said to be significantly more powerful than the H20 GPUs Nvidia had customized to sell in China.

For the chipmaker, expanding production of the H200 GPUs would let it tap latent demand in a country that is racing to develop its own homegrown AI chips. Competition and national security concerns in the West have hampered the availability of the latest and most powerful hardware for training AI models in China, where companies have resorted to focusing on efficiency over sheer scale.

Chinese companies, including Alibaba and ByteDance, which are developing their own AI models, have already been in touch with Nvidia to figure out large orders for the H200 chips, which are being produced in limited quantities, the report added.

“We are managing our supply chain to ensure that licensed sales of the H200 to authorized customers in China will have no impact on our ability to supply customers in the United States,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

AI lets anyone create videos, but many AI video creation tools lack support for audio. Mirelo is building AI that adds soundtracks to match the video's action.

Earlier this year, the Berlin-based startup released Mirelo SFX v1.5, an AI model that interprets videos to add synced sound effects (SFX). 

This attracted attention from VCs gearing up for a generative AI revolution in games. The two-year-old German startup has raised a $41 million seed round led by Index Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, TechCrunch learned exclusively.

This new capital will help Mirelo compete more effectively in its emerging category. While it was still in stealth mode and resource-constrained, large companies such as Sony and Tencent released video-to-SFX models. So did Kuaishou-owned Kling AI, out of China, and ElevenLabs, which is also backed by a16z.

While Mirelo already differs from them by its narrower focus, beating these models in the long run requires the startup to make additional hires. Altogether, the startup expects its team of 10 people to “double if not triple” in headcount by the end of next year, Mirelo CEO and co-founder CJ Simon-Gabriel told TechCrunch.

These new hires will support Mirelo's R&D, as well as its product and go-to-market strategy. The startup published its models on Fal.ai and Replicate, and expects API usage to drive most of its revenue in the short term, Simon-Gabriel said. But it is also investing in building out its workspace for creators, Mirelo Studio, which could eventually support full professional use.

As Mirelo prepares to scale, the startup and its investors are also anticipating concerns around training data that have dogged other generative AI companies. According to Georgia Stevenson, who led Index's investments, Mirelo based its models on public and purchased sound libraries, and is signing revenue-sharing partnerships that respect artists' rights. 

It's a tension inherent to generative AI tools, but Mirelo isn't displacing musicians and sound designers — at least not yet. With a freemium model including a recommended plan for creators priced at €20/month (approximately $23.50), the startup is mostly targeting amateurs and prosumers hoping to unmute AI-generated videos.

According to Simon-Gabriel, creators can't fully benefit from this new potential without audio. 

“George Lucas said that sound is 50% of the movie-going experience. It's not an overstatement,” he said. “If anything, it's an understatement. You can take exactly the same images, and the sound will shape a completely different ambience, depending on the sound and the music that you put in there.”



He and his co-founder, Florian Wenzel, are both AI researchers and musicians themselves, and the startup has AI music generation on its roadmap. But Mirelo is seeing more pull for sound effects, in part because there is less research happening than in other AI fields, Simon-Gabriel said. 

“It's easier to build a real moat here, and then to capitalize on it,” he noted.

This could pay off for Mirelo. Simon-Gabriel declined to disclose its new valuation, but said it had increased “very significantly” compared to its previously undisclosed pre-seed round. That earlier round was led by Berlin-based firm Atlantic, which also participated in the new funding, bringing Mirelo's total raised to $44 million and helping close its resource gap.

The startup is also backed by angels who lend credibility to its technology and could open new doors, including Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch, Hugging Face chief science officer Thomas Wolf, Fal.ai co-founder Burkay Gur, and others.

Still, the team is aware that AI-generated videos may not be mute for long. 

For instance, Gemini's video generator now incorporates soundtracks powered by DeepMind's Veo 3.1 video-to-audio model. But if anything, Simon-Gabriel sounds vindicated. “Now, suddenly, people realize, ‘Oh, maybe we should add sound.' But, of course, you should add some. It's a bit like silent movies versus talkies, right? It does make quite a difference!”

In a move that has sent shockwaves through Hollywood, Netflix recently announced its plans to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) for $82.7 billion. Responses from the industry have been generally negative, sparking concern about the acquisition's implications for jobs, the future of theatrical releases, and the representation of diverse voices in film and TV. 

Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have sought to address fears surrounding the deal in a letter to employees, which was made public by Bloomberg on Monday. 

The executives reassured staff of their commitment to maintaining theatrical releases for WBD films. They also asserted that there will be “no overlap or studio closures.” 

The co-CEOs further stated that the “deal is about growth” and that the company is “strengthening one of Hollywood's most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production.”

Despite these assurances, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) has emerged as a vocal opponent of the acquisition, arguing that it violates antitrust laws designed to prevent monopolies. 

Additionally, the deal has attracted the attention of lawmakers. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal submitted a letter to the Justice Department Antitrust Division expressing their concerns about the potential implications of a massive merger in the entertainment industry. 

The senators argue that, in addition to raising ethical questions, the newly merged media giant would possess “more market power than the current companies to raise consumers' television costs,” especially at a time when middle-class families are already facing rising prices. Notably, Netflix raised its subscription prices last January.

To counter monopoly concerns, Peters and Sarandos cited Nielsen data in their letter reportedly showing that combining Netflix and WBD would result in a smaller viewership share than YouTube currently holds, or what a competing Paramount-WBD merger would create.

The letter comes on the heels of Paramount making a competing $108.4 billion offer to acquire WBD, signaling that the competition for media dominance is far from over. Paramount was previously viewed as the main contender; however, CNBC reported that WBD's board rejected the terms of the offer.

The only hint I saw: there's many unusual notes in how she's speaking, which don't come across comfortably.  You have to stop and consider whether she's speaking out of personal bitterness and resentment, or is using herself as an example, to drive home a point about how women in general were mistreated.  Then it turns out it's fabricated, and this is not what she spoke in an interview.I'm very sympathetic to the message, but angry over the misleading way it was presented.The disclosure comes only after 16,000 words of fabricated interview and community Q&A.  And, in the ~900-word afterword, the ""We ask you to read this interview in the spirit in which it is offered: as a thoughtful, historically grounded, but frankly fictional..."" really should've been at the beginning.

Most of Europe has lower GDP per capita than the poorest states of the US, yet the lifestyle of European citizens in those countries is much better than the lifestyle of the poorest Americans.

WW2 did not 'destroy' the UK. It wasn't subjected to any of the horrors of ground warfare, and the Blitz failed to inflict any meaningful damage on it.What WW2 did destroy was the UK government's ability and will to finance the sort of repression that was necessary to maintain a globe-spanning empire. Churchill in his pigheaded hubris could scream from the rooftops about India forever remaining British, but  Clement wasn't going to kill people over it.(In contrast, France lost the ability, but not the will, which is why it fought a few wars in Vietnam and Algiers, instead of letting their colonial subjects have self-rule and independence sans bloodshed.)

This breaks down as soon as you stop looking at abstract rankings and dive into the specific logistic realities of force projection.  France and to a lesser extent the UK are reasonably capable, but there's no math that adds up to anything approaching America's capabilities.

So,    $(US) + $(ALLIES) > $(US) 

However,    $(ALLIES) - $(US) < $(ALLIES) 

This has been true from the beginning, and I don't think was a nefarious plot, or even mistake, for most of the alliance's history. The further we get from the Cold War alignments within which NATO was created, however, the more difficult it has become to sustain.

In the short-term it might be painful, but long-term things will definitively get better, as long as no one feels like they need to pick up the mantle, which is the biggest risk right now. A bit like a painful breakup, some short-term pain is needed for long-term happiness.

The current administration is overtly doing what was previously done covertly. Dictators are acceptable as long as it is politically convenient. One of the most recent cases is Pakistan, where the army has taken over, and EU and Commonwealth election monitors did not issue even election monitor report even after two years. Instead, they have facilitated the murder and killing of Pakistani civilians. But maybe Pakistanis are brown-skinned, so for them, democracy is not allowed.Pakistan should be under sanctions, but it is not, as it is providing ammunition for Ukraine. That is the biggest problem of the West: their hypocrisy. They are calling for democracy in Hong Kong, as that serves their own agendas, but will say nothing about an apartheid state like Israel.""Imran Khan, the former prime minister, has been jailed without trial for the last two-plus years and has been kept in solitary confinement for months out of those.

""The colonial government used the Control of Publications Consolidation Ordinance (1951) to regulate publications and suppress freedom of the press. One notable case resulted in the suppression of the newspaper Ta Kung Pao for six months (later reduced to 12 days) for its criticism of the colonial government's deportation of the Federation of Trade Unions-backed fire relief organisation officials and use of live fire against protestors. Deportation was also used as a method to control politics in education. Lo Tong, a principal at a pro-Beijing, patriotic middle school, had been deported in 1950 for raising the People's Republic of China (PRC) flag and singing the national anthem at his school.""

On the books maybe.  But for instance, America defines treason so narrowly that nobody has been convicted of it since WW2.  Americans are free to sing praise of China, Russia, North Korea, whoever they like no matter how unjustified.  Unless Congress has declared a war, which hasn't happened since WW2, you can talk as much smack about America or praise opposing regimes as much as you like.

There is nothing logically wrong with hypocrisy.  I tell my toddlers not to do stuff I do all the time.The problem with hypocrisy comes when one party is assumed to have more rights than the other.  In this case, why would Britain (or the US's) government be allowed to be more corrupt than China's?I assume Britain is brought up due to the British government's historic role in Hong Kong and China.

And a plain reading of the Basic Law (Hong Kong's constitution) permits everything that's happened, and expecting the contrary seems like a coping mechanism. There are massive exemptions for Hong Kong's autonomy and deferrence to Beijing at Beijing's discretion, or by the Head of Hong Kong who is appointed by BeijingI wasn't around for the handover so I'm largely exempt from the emotional marriage to an ideal Hong Kong residents and people affirming Hong Kong resident's feelings seem to haveThe legislature wouldn't have to be consulted for the National Security Law to have been enacted, the article and seemingly all of the west seems to think that is a controversy when it isn't necessaryAnd then there is another layer where the structure of the legislature doesn't even match western ideals and wouldn't have made a difference. The legislature is 50% popular vote and 50% corporations. So even if 100% of the population voted for the same thing, they would only have 50% of the vote, and the corporations are all pro-Beijing by nature of being able to economically exist in that environment.(Notably, the ancient City of London within London functions nearly the same way. Actually in an even more egregios way with the non-natural persons having a more extreme weighting of votes)People are like a different founding document governs Hong Kong, when it doesn't. People act like the governing document of Hong Kong was supposed to be ignored for 50 years, when something way different and way more integrated is supposed to happen at the end of the handover period.I think there is zero path to the goals Hong Kong residents espouse and are used to.

The Chinese were obviously always opposed to British imperalism and it was a major victory to finally get HK back, including in HK, and even acknowledged in Taiwan.

European imperialism and colonialism has long been rejected except somehow for the so great thing it did in HK, conveniently forgetting that the British never had any democracy in HK and acquired HK by pretty nasty means.

GOLDSTEIN: China has not allowed more freedom of speech. Publications can still be shut down for criticizing the government. And yet, China has gotten richer. It started to develop its own financial center in Shanghai. Foreign money can now flow into China without going through Hong Kong, so the Chinese Communist Party doesn't need Hong Kong as much as it used to.This has led to more and more tension between people in Hong Kong and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government. In 2014, there was a fight over how to choose the government official who runs Hong Kong, and a million people in Hong Kong took to the streets to protest. Just last month, the government official who runs Hong Kong wanted to pass a new law that would allow people in Hong Kong to be extradited to China to stand trial.

From what I can tell, the 'Metal' offering runs on nodes with directly attached NVMe rather than network-attached storage. That means there isn't a per-customer IOPS cap – they actually market it as 'unlimited I/O' because you hit CPU before saturating the disk. The new $50 M-class clusters are essentially smaller versions of those nodes with adjustable CPU and RAM in AWS and GCP .RE: EC2 shapes, it's not a shared EBS volume but a dedicated instance with local storage. BUT you'll still want to monitor capacity since the storage doesn't autoscale.ALSO this pricing makes high-throughput Postgres accessible for indie projects, which is pretty neat.

So in the M-10 case, wouldn't this actually be somewhat misleading as I imagine hitting ""1/8 vCPU"" wouldn't be difficult at all?

reply

You can get a lot more out of that CPU allocation with the fast I/O of a local NVMe drive than from the slow I/O of an EBS volume.

- Aurora storage scales with your needs, meaning that you don't need to worry about running out of space as your data grows.
- Aurora will auto-scale CPU and memory based on the needs of your application, within the bounds you set. It does this without any downtime, or even dropping connections. You don't have to worry about choosing the right CPU and memory up-front, and for most applications you can simply adjust your limits as you go. This is great for applications that are growing over time, or for applications with daily or weekly cycles of usage.The other Aurora option is Aurora DSQL. The advantages of picking DSQL are:- A generous free tier to get you going with development.
- Scale-to-zero and scale-up, on storage, CPU, and memory. If you aren't sending any traffic to your database it costs you nothing (except storage), and you can scale up to millions of transactions per second with no changes.
- No infrastructure to configure or manage, no updates, no thinking about replicas, etc. You don't have to understand CPU or memory ratios, think about software versions, think about primaries and secondaries, or any of that stuff. High availability, scaling of reads and writes, patching, etc is all built-in.

If your or another customer's workload grows and needs to size up we launch three whole new database servers of the appropriate size (whether that's more CPU+RAM, more storage, or both), restore the most recent backups there, catch up on replication, and then orchestrate changing the primary.Downtime when you resize typically amounts to needing to reconnect i.e. it's negligible.

Even to take a case in point where durability is irrelevant - people building caches in Postgres (so as to only have one datastore / not need Redis as well). Not a big deal if the cache blows up - just force everyone to login again. Would love to see the vendor reduce complexity on their end and pass through the savings to the customer.edit: per your other reply re. using replication to handle resizing, maybe being upfront with customers about additional latency / downtime being necessary with single-node discounts, then for resizing you could break connections, take a backup, then restore the backup on a resized node?

Since police are part of the law, when they don't hold their own accountable, there's no recourse. And that's a real problem.

1) As other commenters have noted: raw numbers. In general, people are taking the resource consumption of new datacenters and attributing 100% of that to ""because AI,"" when the reality is generally that while AI is increasing spend on new infrastructure, data companies are always spending on new infrastructure because of everything they do.2) Comparative cost. In general, image synthesis takes between 80 and 300 times fewer resources (mostly electricity) per image than human creation does. It turns out a modern digital artist letting their CPU idle and screen on while they muse is soaking significant resources that an AI is using to just synthesize. Granted, this is also not an apples-to-apples comparison because the average AI flow generates dozens of draft images to find the one that is used, but the net resource effect might be less energy spent in total per produced image (on a skew of ""more spent by computers"" and ""less by people"").

Google group selection if you'd like to go down a deep rabbit whole but the upshot is, if pro-social behavior did not confer and individual advantage, the individuals who lose the trait would outcompete their conspecifics  and the pro-social trait would not be fixed in the population.This is why you usually see additional stabilizing mechanism(s) to suppress free-loading, in addition to the pro-social traits themselves, even in very simple examples of pro-social traits such as bacteria collaboratively creating biofilms.The genes coding for the biofilms are usually coded on transmissible plasmids, making it possible for one individual to re-infect another that has lost it.You might consider the justice system, police etc. as analogous to that.So yes, in the case where you're part of a functioning society and free-loading on the pro-social behavior of others, that is temporarily beneficial to you - until the stabilizing mechanisms kick in.I'm not saying in practice you can never get away with anything, of course you can.

And the reason that is is because there's no affordable, moral way to give 100,000 farmers [nor consumers] a small dose of a product for 20 years before declaring it safe. So the system guesses, and it guesses wrong, often erring against the side of caution in the US (it's actually quite shocking how many pesticides later get revoked after approval).Europe takes a more ""precautionary principle"" approach. In those cases of ambiguity (which is most things approved and not), they err to the side of caution.Notice how this claim here is again shifting the burden to the victims (their research doesn't meet standard X, allegedly). Absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence.

1) Evidence for the null hypothesis (there are enough studies with sufficient statistical power to determine that product likely does not cause harm at a >95% CI).2) There is no evidence that it is unsafe.

And due to widespread regulatory capture, this is hardly some social benefit. The original case Chevron Doctrine was based on [1] essentially came down to the EPA interpreting anti-pollution laws in a way enabling companies to expand pollution-causing constructions with no oversight. The EPA was then sued, and defeated, by an environmental activist group, but then that decision was overturned by the Supreme Court and Chevron Deference was born.Other examples are the FCC deeming broadband internet as a ""information service"" instead of a ""telecommunications service"" (which would have meant common-carrier obligations would have applied), and so on. Another one [3] - Congress passed legislation deeming that power plants must use the ""best technology available"" to ""minimize the adverse environmental impact"" of their water intakes/processing.

It was weaponized by both parties to create defacto laws without proper legal procedure. It should've been unconstitutional from the beginning as only Congress can make laws. Regulatory agencies are far easier to control, generally contain administration-friendly plants, and are not expected to provide any justification for their decisions. The result is laws that change as the wind blows, confusions, and rights restrictions done by people who should have no business doing so. The “reasonable interpretation” rule allowed Congress to completely defer to them and force citizens to spend tremendous capital getting a case to the Supreme Court.Chevron's overturn was objectively a huge win and hardly a “rogue” decision. That editorialization is not a fair representation of the problems it has caused when regulatory agencies begin attempting to regulate constitutional rights. It was overly vague and gave far too much power to people who cannot be trusted with it.We shouldn't need Chevron Deference to make laws that protect people from harm done by corporations. Period. If we do, it's a failure of Congress to do their jobs and a mechanism should be in place to have a “reset button” (like many other countries when they form a government).

While it is not a popular topic here, gun laws, and I am taking a risk with my karma even talking about it, have been subject to some of the most vague and dangerous interpretations by the ATF. In this case we provided congress a way to bypass constitutional scrutiny (pre-bruen) by deferring to the ATF. Two examples are bump stocks, and FRTs, both of which the ATF interpreted as ""machine guns"", defying their own regulatory definition, and creating felons out of innocent people quite literally overnight. Honest people had their doors literally kicked in. This is a terrifying level of power. It is not the first time the ATF has done this. I would recommend spending time reading the writings of GOA and FPC if you'd like to see how confusing it is for a law abiding gun owner to stay within the lines of the law when Chevron Deference existed. At any point something you lawfully buy, fill out the correct forms, and lawfully own, could be suddenly interpreted with no notification as criminal and thus you INSTANTLY become a felon. There are violations of ex-post-facto, denial of constitutional rights, etc.Justification is highly subjective and in many cases these regulatory agencies are handed the pen to write and sign their laws.There is no difference between a regulatory agency writing and passing law, and congress completely deferring all responsibility to them. This is the problem. ""Justification"" is not held to any standard.My personal opinion is opinion from a regulatory agency should be held to a higher standard than even the most prestigious academic journal given the consequences. Chevron Deference being used to regulate companies is one thing. Chevron Deference being used to regulate constitutional rights is a consequence, and thus, it is a good thing it is eliminated. Perhaps congress can actually do it's job and demand a higher level of scrutiny, care, and precision from our regulatory agencies.

Congress is expected to make laws. End of story. Chevron Deference allows them to reduce their own liability and burden by rubberstamping opinion into law. That is a tremendous problem. Congress' core directive is to protect our rights. Not restrict them. Industry plants have a much easier time infesting regulatory bodies through revolving door policies, regulatory bodies change with every administration, and regulatory bodies are not held to a standard of rigor that approaches 1/10th of the worst quality scientific journal. That is a major problem. The first thing any true tactical politician will do is move his or her favorite industry plants into regulatory bodies. Then, they can give ""opinion"" that aligns with the view of that person, which is then rubberstamped into law.If we cannot expect congress to do their job our government has failed it's absolute simplest purpose. There are then much greater problems than whether turtles are choking on can holders.

I no longer use any chemical for lawn care.As to the plight of the farmers: I wonder if most of them bothered to used proper personal protection gear when spraying? Even if they had enclosed cabs, the chemical would still coat the tractor and tank surfaces which can be rubbed against at any time.

One case published in the Rhode Island Medical Journal described an instance where a 50-year-old man accidentally ingested paraquat, and the nurse treating him was burned by his urine that splashed onto her forearms. Within a day, her skin blistered and sloughed off.

Should we ban anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, or gasoline? They are nasty and dangerous too. The article is purely scare-mongering to make it seem true while obviously pushing an agenda. This is not science. See my reply at the same level after I did a review.

I'm not saying pesticides are health tonics, but this piece feels like pure litigation PR rather than an actual investigation. It prioritizes storytelling over science and engages in what I can only describe as lying by omission. Here are the main issues I found:The nurse whose skin peeled off just from touching a patient's urine? The article frames this to make you think, ""Wow, this stuff is so toxic that if a farmer uses it, his body becomes a weapon."" I looked into the medical case this is likely based on. That patient didn't just ""farm"" with Paraquat; he ingested a lethal, concentrated dose (usually a suicide attempt). By leaving out that the patient drank a cup of poison, the author conflates Acute Poisoning (death in days, acid urine) with Chronic Exposure (trace amounts over years). If the farmer in the main story had enough Paraquat in his system to burn a nurse's skin, he wouldn't be alive to give an interview about Parkinson's. He'd be dead from multi-organ failure. Omitting this context is manipulative fear-mongering.Then there is the math: Parkinson's affects about 1% of the elderly population. There are 2 million farms in the US. Even if Paraquat was essentially harmless water, you would still have tens of thousands of farmers with Parkinson's purely by chance. The article ignores this base rate to imply that every diagnosis is a result of the chemical. It treats a probabilistic risk as a deterministic cause.It also ignores confounders (like the ""Rural Cluster"" Problem). Farming is a ""chemical soup"" lifestyle. You have well water (a known PD risk), head trauma risks, and exposure to dozens of other chemicals like Rotenone or Maneb. The article presents a direct line: Paraquat -> PD. But scientifically, isolating one chemical from 30 years of rural living is a nightmare. The article doesn't even attempt to falsify the hypothesis or look at other factors; it just assumes the lawsuit's narrative is the scientific truth.The article also fails basic science standards. It is storytelling, not science. A real scientific inquiry follows Popperian standards—you make a conjecture and then try to disprove it. This article does the opposite: it acts like a defense attorney. It stacks up emotional anecdotes and selective correlations to confirm its bias and ignores the replication crisis in epidemiology where results often don't stick.This isn't journalism and it's not science; it's advocacy via outrage. It uses the real tragedy of these farmers to push a specific narrative, relying on readers not knowing the difference between drinking poison and spraying crops. If you've ever wondered why science doesn't make more progress, and we have the replication crisis, look no further.

Of course humans who inhale this thing in small quantities won't die, but you can be sure they will kill some tissues that they go into. Now comes another problem of regular exposure, and these chemicals having an entry, but no exit path. That just means there are tissues, that are likely dying out every time there is a exposure.Again none of this might kill you at the first exposure, but if there are enough dead tissues, there sure is likely to be things like Parkinson's or may be even diabetes.Im guessing combined with this, if you already some bad genetics it could cause issues like these.

There are many common pesticides which have extreme toxicity to humans, including HCN (Hydrogen Cyanide), (ab)used under the brand-name Zyklon B in WW2, and still sold today as a (controlled-use) pesticide under generic brand names.It's a chasm-leap to say that pesticides are generally safe to humans.

A baseline rate or Parkinsons would be a good addition to the article. I have seen figures of 1 out of 331 for total or apparently about 1.1M total. Farmers make up about 2% of the population. Doing rough back of envelope math shows that you would expect 22K farmers to have Parkinsons assuming even distribution by population.
The numbers aren't precise but if the article's thousands was taken literally it would ironically suggest paraquat has a protective effect against Parkinsons which is obviously absurd thing to assume from a known neurotoxin.Not every farmer with Parkinsons is suing though. If we assume 1% of farmers are involved in lawsuits then thousands is alarming because it would imply 10x rates. 10% suing though and it is expected. 100% suing would be 1/10th the general rate which would fit with the absurd counterfactual hypothesis that non-lethal paraquat exposure prevents Parkinsons.

This is the legitimate end of the spectrum. The science that drove tallow out of kitchens and homes was incomplete, particularly when it was replaced with trans fats.Where it goes off the rails is when nutters conclude that because tallow was wronged in one context, it is wronged in all of them, which leads to folks rubbing tallow on their faces [1].

Here's how pinning a utopian vision for AI on LLMs kicked off the hype cycle that's causing fears of a bubble today.

Each time you've heard a borderline outlandish idea of what AI will be capable of, it often turns out that Sam Altman was, if not the first to articulate it, at least the most persuasive and influential voice behind it. 

For more than a decade he has been known in Silicon Valley as a world-class fundraiser and persuader. OpenAI's early releases around 2020 set the stage for a mania around large language models, and the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 granted Altman a world stage on which to present his new thesis: that these models mirror human intelligence and could swing the doors open to a healthier and wealthier techno-utopia.

This story is part of MIT Technology Review's Hype Correction package, a series that resets expectations about what AI is, what it makes possible, and where we go next.

Throughout, Altman's words have set the agenda. He has framed a prospective superintelligent AI as either humanistic or catastrophic, depending on what effect he was hoping to create, what he was raising money for, or which tech giant seemed like his most formidable competitor at the moment. 

Examining Altman's statements over the years reveals just how much his outlook has powered today's AI boom. Even among Silicon Valley's many hypesters, he's been especially willing to speak about open questions—whether large language models contain the ingredients of human thought, whether language can also produce intelligence—as if they were already answered. 

What he says about AI is rarely provable when he says it, but it persuades us of one thing: This road we're on with AI can go somewhere either great or terrifying, and OpenAI will need epic sums to steer it toward the right destination. In this sense, he is the ultimate hype man.

To understand how his voice has shaped our understanding of what AI can do, we read almost everything he's ever said about the technology (we requested an interview with Altman, but he was not made available). 

His own words trace how we arrived here.

Altman didn't dupe the world. OpenAI has ushered in a genuine tech revolution, with increasingly impressive language models that have attracted millions of users. Even skeptics would concede that LLMs' conversational ability is astonishing.

But Altman's hype has always hinged less on today's capabilities than on a philosophical tomorrow—an outlook that quite handily doubles as a case for more capital and friendlier regulation. Long before large language models existed, he was imagining an AI powerful enough to require wealth redistribution, just as he imagined humanity colonizing other planets. Again and again, promises of a destination—abundance, superintelligence, a healthier and wealthier world—have come first, and the evidence second. 

Even if LLMs eventually hit a wall, there's little reason to think his faith in a techno-utopian future will falter. The vision was never really about the particulars of the current model anyway.  

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you'll see it's a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won't compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people's political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

Everyone in tech agrees we're in a bubble. They just can't agree on what it looks like — or what happens when it pops.

MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what's coming next. You can read more from the series here.

In July, a widely cited MIT study claimed that 95% of organizations that invested in generative AI were getting “zero return.” Tech stocks briefly plunged. While the study itself was more nuanced than the headlines, for many it still felt like the first hard data point confirming what skeptics had muttered for months: Hype around AI might be outpacing reality.

Then, in August, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said what everyone in Silicon Valley had been whispering. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI?” he said during a press dinner I attended. “My opinion is yes.” 

This story is part of MIT Technology Review's Hype Correction package, a series that resets expectations about what AI is, what it makes possible, and where we go next.

He compared the current moment to the dot-com bubble. “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” he explained. “Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited.” 

With those comments, it was off to the races. The next day's stock market dip was attributed to the sentiment he shared. The question “Are we in an AI bubble?” became inescapable.

The short answer: Lots of people. But not everyone agrees on who or what is overinflated. Tech leaders are using this moment of fear to take shots at their rivals and position themselves as clear winners on the other side. How they describe the bubble depends on where their company sits.

When I asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg about the AI bubble in September, he ran through the historical analogies of past bubbles—railroads, fiber for the internet, the dot-com boom—and noted that in each case, “the infrastructure gets built out, people take on too much debt, and then you hit some blip ... and then a lot of the companies end up going out of business.”

But Zuckerberg's prescription wasn't for Meta to pump the brakes. It was to keep spending: “If we end up misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars, I think that that is going to be very unfortunate, obviously. But I'd say the risk is higher on the other side.”

Bret Taylor, the chairman of OpenAI and CEO of the AI startup Sierra, uses a mental model from the late '90s to help navigate this AI bubble. “I think the closest analogue to this AI wave is the dot-com boom or bubble, depending on your level of pessimism,” he recently told me. Back then, he explained, everyone knew e-commerce was going to be big, but there was a massive difference between Buy.com and Amazon. Taylor and others have been trying to position themselves as today's Amazon.

Still others are arguing that the pain will be widespread. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told the BBC this month that there's “some irrationality” in the current boom. Asked whether Google would be immune to a bubble bursting, he warned, “I think no company is going to be immune, including us.""

Companies are raising enormous sums of money and seeing unprecedented valuations. Much of that money, in turn, is going toward the buildout of massive data centers—on which both private companies like OpenAI and Elon Musk's xAI and public ones such as Meta and Google are spending heavily. OpenAI has pledged that it will spend $500 billion to build AI data centers, more than 15 times what was spent on the Manhattan Project.

This eye-popping spending on AI data centers isn't entirely detached from reality. The leaders of the top AI companies all stress that they're bottlenecked by their limited access to computing power. You hear it constantly when you talk to them. Startups can't get the GPU allocations they need. Hyperscalers are rationing compute, saving it for their best customers.

If today's AI market is as brutally supply-constrained as tech leaders claim, perhaps aggressive infrastructure buildouts are warranted. But some of the numbers are too large to comprehend. Sam Altman has told employees that OpenAI's moonshot goal is to build 250 gigawatts of computing capacity by 2033, roughly equaling India's total national electricity demand. Such a plan would cost more than $12 trillion by today's standards.

“I do think there's real execution risk,” OpenAI president and cofounder Greg Brockman recently told me about the company's aggressive infrastructure goals. “Everything we say about the future, we see that it's a possibility. It is not a certainty, but I don't think the uncertainty comes from scientific questions. It's a lot of hard work.”

It depends on who you ask. During the August press dinner, where he made his market-moving comments, Altman was blunt about where he sees the excess. He said it's “insane” that some AI startups with “three people and an idea” are receiving funding at such high valuations. “That's not rational behavior,” he said. “Someone's gonna get burned there, I think.” As Safe Superintelligence cofounder (and former OpenAI chief scientist and cofounder) Ilya Sutskever put it on a recent podcast: Silicon Valley has “more companies than ideas.”

Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, offered a similar diagnosis when I spoke with him in November. “It feels like there's obviously a bubble in the private market,” he said. “You look at seed rounds with just nothing being tens of billions of dollars. That seems a little unsustainable.""

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei also struck at his competition during the New York Times DealBook Summit in early December. He said he feels confident about the technology itself but worries about how others are behaving on the business side: “On the economic side, I have my concerns where, even if the technology fulfills all its promises, I think there are players in the ecosystem who, if they just make a timing error, they just get it off by a little bit, bad things could happen.""

He stopped short of naming Sam Altman and OpenAI, but the implication was clear. “There are some players who are YOLOing,” he said. “Let's say you're a person who just kind of constitutionally wants to YOLO things or just likes big numbers. Then you may turn the dial too far.”

Amodei also flagged “circular deals,” or the increasingly common arrangements where chip suppliers like Nvidia invest in AI companies that then turn around and spend those funds on their chips. Anthropic has done some of these, he said, though “not at the same scale as some other players.” (OpenAI is at the center of a number of such deals, as are Nvidia, CoreWeave, and a roster of other players.) 

The danger, he explained, comes when the numbers get too big: “If you start stacking these where they get to huge amounts of money, and you're saying, 'By 2027 or 2028 I need to make $200 billion a year,' then yeah, you can overextend yourself.”

Zuckerberg shared a similar message at an internal employee Q&A session after Meta's last earnings call. He noted that unprofitable startups like OpenAI and Anthropic risk bankruptcy if they misjudge the timing of their investments, but Meta has the advantage of strong cash flow, he reassured staff.

My conversations with tech executives and investors suggest that the bubble will be most likely to pop if overfunded startups can't turn a profit or grow into their lofty valuations. This bubble could last longer than than past ones, given that private markets aren't traded on public markets and therefore move more slowly, but the ripple effects will still be profound when the end comes. 

If companies making grand commitments to data center buildouts no longer have the revenue growth to support them, the headline deals that have propped up the stock market come into question. Anthropic's Amodei illustrated the problem during his DealBook Summit appearance, where he said the multi-year data center commitments he has to make combine with the company's rapid, unpredictable revenue growth rate to create a “cone of uncertainty” about how much to spend.

The two most prominent private players in AI, OpenAI and Anthropic, have yet to turn a profit. A recent Deutsche Bank chart put the situation in stark historical context. Amazon burned through $3 billion before becoming profitable. Tesla, around $4 billion. Uber, $30 billion. OpenAI is projected to burn through $140 billion by 2029, while Anthropic is expected to burn $20 billion by 2027.

Consultants at Bain estimate that the wave of AI infrastructure spending will require $2 trillion in annual AI revenue by 2030 just to justify the investment. That's more than the combined 2024 revenue of Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia. When I talk to leaders of these large tech companies, they all agree that their sprawling businesses can absorb an expensive miscalculation about the returns from their AI infrastructure buildouts. It's all the other companies that are either highly leveraged with debt or just unprofitable—even OpenAI and Anthropic—that they worry about. 

Still, given the level of spending on AI, it still needs a viable business model beyond subscriptions, which won't be able to  drive profits from billions of people's eyeballs like the ad-driven businesses that have defined the last 20 years of the internet. Even the largest tech companies know they need to ship the world-changing agents they keep hyping: AI that can fully replace coworkers and complete tasks in the real world. 

For now, investors are mostly buying into the hype of the powerful AI systems that these data center buildouts will supposedly unlock in the future. At some point the biggest spenders, like OpenAI, will need to show investors that the money spent on the infrastructure buildout was worth it.

There's also still a lot of uncertainty about the technical direction that AI is heading in. LLMs are expected to remain critical to more advanced AI systems, but industry leaders can't seem to agree on which additional breakthroughs are needed to achieve artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Some are betting on new kinds of AI that can understand the physical world, while others are focused on training AI to learn in a general way, like a human. In other words, what if all this unprecedented spending turns out to have been backing the wrong horse?

What makes this moment surreal is the honesty. The same people pouring billions into AI will openly tell you it might all come crashing down. 

Taylor framed it as two truths existing at once. “I think it is both true that AI will transform the economy,” he told me, “and I think we're also in a bubble, and a lot of people will lose a lot of money. I think both are absolutely true at the same time.""

He compared it to the internet. Webvan failed, but Instacart succeeded years later with essentially the same idea. If you were an Amazon shareholder from its IPO to now, you're looking pretty good. If you were a Webvan shareholder, you probably feel differently. 

""When the dust settles and you see who the winners are, society benefits from those inventions,” Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said in October. “This is real. The benefit to society from AI is going to be gigantic.”

Goldman Sachs says the AI boom now looks the way tech stocks did in 1997, several years before the dot-com bubble actually burst. The bank flagged five warning signs seen in the late 1990s that investors should watch now: peak investment spending, falling corporate profits, rising corporate debt, Fed rate cuts, and widening credit spreads. We're probably not at 1999 levels yet. But the imbalances are building fast. Michael Burry, who famously called the 2008 housing bubble collapse (as seen in the film The Big Short), recently compared the AI boom to the 1990s dot-com bubble too.

Maybe AI will save us from our own irrational exuberance. But for now, we're living in an in-between moment when everyone knows what's coming but keeps blowing more air into the balloon anyway. As Altman put it that night at dinner: “Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money. We don't know who.”

Alex Heath is the author of Sources, a newsletter about the AI race, and the cohost of ACCESS, a podcast about the tech industry's inside conversations. Previously, he was deputy editor at The Verge. 

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you'll see it's a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won't compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Developers are navigating confusing gaps between expectation and reality. So are the rest of us.

Depending who you ask, AI-powered coding is either giving software developers an unprecedented productivity boost or churning out masses of poorly designed code that saps their attention and sets software projects up for serious long term-maintenance problems.

The problem is right now, it's not easy to know which is true.

As tech giants pour billions into large language models (LLMs), coding has been touted as the technology's killer app. Both Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Google CEO Sundar Pichai have claimed that around a quarter of their companies' code is now AI-generated. And in March, Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, predicted that within six months 90% of all code would be written by AI. It's an appealing and obvious use case. Code is a form of language, we need lots of it, and it's expensive to produce manually. It's also easy to tell if it works—run a program and it's immediately evident whether it's functional.

This story is part of MIT Technology Review's Hype Correction package, a series that resets expectations about what AI is, what it makes possible, and where we go next.

Executives enamored with the potential to break through human bottlenecks are pushing engineers to lean into an AI-powered future. But after speaking to more than 30 developers, technology executives, analysts, and researchers, MIT Technology Review found that the picture is not as straightforward as it might seem.  

For some developers on the front lines, initial enthusiasm is waning as they bump up against the technology's limitations. And as a growing body of research suggests that the claimed productivity gains may be illusory, some are questioning whether the emperor is wearing any clothes.

The pace of progress is complicating the picture, though. A steady drumbeat of new model releases mean these tools' capabilities and quirks are constantly evolving. And their utility often depends on the tasks they are applied to and the organizational structures built around them. All of this leaves developers navigating confusing gaps between expectation and reality. 

Is it the best of times or the worst of times (to channel Dickens) for AI coding? Maybe both.

It's hard to avoid AI coding tools these days. There are a dizzying array of products available, both from model developers like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google and from companies like Cursor and Windsurf, which wrap these models in polished code-editing software. And according to Stack Overflow's 2025 Developer Survey, they're being adopted rapidly, with 65% of developers now using them at least weekly.

AI coding tools first emerged around 2016 but were supercharged with the arrival of LLMs. Early versions functioned as little more than autocomplete for programmers, suggesting what to type next. Today they can analyze entire code bases, edit across files, fix bugs, and even generate documentation explaining how the code works. All this is guided through natural-language prompts via a chat interface.

“Agents”—autonomous LLM-powered coding tools that can take a high-level plan and build entire programs independently—represent the latest frontier in AI coding. This leap was enabled by the latest reasoning models, which can tackle complex problems step by step and, crucially, access external tools to complete tasks. “This is how the model is able to code, as opposed to just talk about coding,” says Boris Cherny, head of Claude Code, Anthropic's coding agent.

These agents have made impressive progress on software engineering benchmarks—standardized tests that measure model performance. When OpenAI introduced the SWE-bench Verified benchmark in August 2024, offering a way to evaluate agents' success at fixing real bugs in open-source repositories, the top model solved just 33% of issues. A year later, leading models consistently score above 70%. 

In February, Andrej Karpathy, a founding member of OpenAI and former director of AI at Tesla, coined the term “vibe coding”—meaning an approach where people describe software in natural language and let AI write, refine, and debug the code. Social media abounds with developers who have bought into this vision, claiming massive productivity boosts.

But while some developers and companies report such productivity gains, the hard evidence is more mixed. Early studies from GitHub, Google, and Microsoft—all vendors of AI tools—found developers completing tasks 20% to 55% faster. But a September report from the consultancy Bain & Company described real-world savings as “unremarkable.”

Data from the developer analytics firm GitClear shows that most engineers are producing roughly 10% more durable code—code that isn't deleted or rewritten within weeks—since 2022, likely thanks to AI. But that gain has come with sharp declines in several measures of code quality. Stack Overflow's survey also found trust and positive sentiment toward AI tools falling significantly for the first time. And most provocatively, a July study by the nonprofit research organization Model Evaluation & Threat Research (METR) showed that while experienced developers believed AI made them 20% faster, objective tests showed they were actually 19% slower.

For Mike Judge, principal developer at the software consultancy Substantial, the METR study struck a nerve. He was an enthusiastic early adopter of AI tools, but over time he grew frustrated with their limitations and the modest boost they brought to his productivity. “I was complaining to people because I was like, ‘It's helping me but I can't figure out how to make it really help me a lot,'” he says. “I kept feeling like the AI was really dumb, but maybe I could trick it into being smart if I found the right magic incantation.”

When asked by a friend, Judge had estimated the tools were providing a roughly 25% speedup. So when he saw similar estimates attributed to developers in the METR study he decided to test his own. For six weeks, he guessed how long a task would take, flipped a coin to decide whether to use AI or code manually, and timed himself. To his surprise, AI slowed him down by an median of 21%—mirroring the METR results.

This got Judge crunching the numbers. If these tools were really speeding developers up, he reasoned, you should see a massive boom in new apps, website registrations, video games, and projects on GitHub. He spent hours and several hundred dollars analyzing all the publicly available data and found flat lines everywhere.

“Shouldn't this be going up and to the right?” says Judge. “Where's the hockey stick on any of these graphs? I thought everybody was so extraordinarily productive.” The obvious conclusion, he says, is that AI tools provide little productivity boost for most developers. 

Developers interviewed by MIT Technology Review generally agree on where AI tools excel: producing “boilerplate code” (reusable chunks of code repeated in multiple places with little modification), writing tests, fixing bugs, and explaining unfamiliar code to new developers. Several noted that AI helps overcome the “blank page problem” by offering an imperfect first stab to get a developer's creative juices flowing. It can also let nontechnical colleagues quickly prototype software features, easing the load on already overworked engineers.

These tasks can be tedious, and developers are typically  glad to hand them off. But they represent only a small part of an experienced engineer's workload. For the more complex problems where engineers really earn their bread, many developers told MIT Technology Review, the tools face significant hurdles.

Perhaps the biggest problem is that LLMs can hold only a limited amount of information in their “context window”—essentially their working memory. This means they struggle to parse large code bases and are prone to forgetting what they're doing on longer tasks. “It gets really nearsighted—it'll only look at the thing that's right in front of it,” says Judge. “And if you tell it to do a dozen things, it'll do 11 of them and just forget that last one.”

LLMs' myopia can lead to headaches for human coders. While an LLM-generated response to a problem may work in isolation, software is made up of hundreds of interconnected modules. If these aren't built with consideration for other parts of the software, it can quickly lead to a tangled, inconsistent code base that's hard for humans to parse and, more important, to maintain.

Developers have traditionally addressed this by following conventions—loosely defined coding guidelines that differ widely between projects and teams. “AI has this overwhelming tendency to not understand what the existing conventions are within a repository,” says Bill Harding, the CEO of GitClear. “And so it is very likely to come up with its own slightly different version of how to solve a problem.”

The models also just get things wrong. Like all LLMs, coding models are prone to “hallucinating”—it's an issue built into how they work. But because the code they output looks so polished, errors can be difficult to detect, says James Liu, director of software engineering at the advertising technology company Mediaocean. Put all these flaws together, and using these tools can feel a lot like pulling a lever on a one-armed bandit. “Some projects you get a 20x improvement in terms of speed or efficiency,” says Liu. “On other things, it just falls flat on its face, and you spend all this time trying to coax it into granting you the wish that you wanted and it's just not going to.”

Judge suspects this is why engineers often overestimate productivity gains. “You remember the jackpots. You don't remember sitting there plugging tokens into the slot machine for two hours,” he says.

And it can be particularly pernicious if the developer is unfamiliar with the task. Judge remembers getting AI to help set up a Microsoft cloud service called an Azure Functions, which he'd never used before. He thought it would take about two hours, but nine hours later he threw in the towel. “It kept leading me down these rabbit holes and I didn't know enough about the topic to be able to tell it ‘Hey, this is nonsensical,'” he says.

Developers constantly make trade-offs between speed of development and the maintainability of their code—creating what's known as “technical debt,” says Geoffrey G. Parker, professor of engineering innovation at Dartmouth College. Each shortcut adds complexity and makes the code base harder to manage, accruing “interest” that must eventually be repaid by restructuring the code. As this debt piles up, adding new features and maintaining the software becomes slower and more difficult.

Accumulating technical debt is inevitable in most projects, but AI tools make it much easier for time-pressured engineers to cut corners, says GitClear's Harding. And GitClear's data suggests this is happening at scale. Since 2020, the company has seen a significant rise in the amount of copy-pasted code—an indicator that developers are reusing more code snippets, most likely based on AI suggestions—and an even bigger decline in the amount of code moved from one place to another, which happens when developers clean up their code base.

And as models improve, the code they produce is becoming increasingly verbose and complex, says Tariq Shaukat, CEO of Sonar, which makes tools for checking code quality. This is driving down the number of obvious bugs and security vulnerabilities, he says, but at the cost of increasing the number of “code smells”—harder-to-pinpoint flaws that lead to maintenance problems and technical debt. 

Recent research by Sonar found that these make up more than 90% of the issues found in code generated by leading AI models. “Issues that are easy to spot are disappearing, and what's left are much more complex issues that take a while to find,” says Shaukat. “That's what worries us about this space at the moment. You're almost being lulled into a false sense of security.”

If AI tools make it increasingly difficult to maintain code, that could have significant security implications, says Jessica Ji, a security researcher at Georgetown University. “The harder it is to update things and fix things, the more likely a code base or any given chunk of code is to become insecure over time,” says Ji.

There are also more specific security concerns, she says. Researchers have discovered a worrying class of hallucinations where models reference nonexistent software packages in their code. Attackers can exploit this by creating packages with those names that harbor vulnerabilities, which the model or developer may then unwittingly incorporate into software. 

LLMs are also vulnerable to “data-poisoning attacks,” where hackers seed the publicly available data sets models train on with data that alters the model's behavior in undesirable ways, such as generating insecure code when triggered by specific phrases. In October, research by Anthropic found that as few as 250 malicious documents can introduce this kind of back door into an LLM regardless of its size.

Despite these issues, though, there's probably no turning back. “Odds are that writing every line of code on a keyboard by hand—those days are quickly slipping behind us,” says Kyle Daigle, chief operating officer at the Microsoft-owned code-hosting platform GitHub, which produces a popular AI-powered tool called Copilot (not to be confused with the Microsoft product of the same name).

The Stack Overflow report found that despite growing distrust in the technology, usage has increased rapidly and consistently over the past three years. Erin Yepis, a senior analyst at Stack Overflow, says this suggests that engineers are taking advantage of the tools with a clear-eyed view of the risks. The report also found that frequent users tend to be more enthusiastic and more than half of developers are not using the latest coding agents, perhaps explaining why many remain underwhelmed by the technology.

Those latest tools can be a revelation. Trevor Dilley, CTO at the software development agency Twenty20 Ideas, says he had found some value in AI editors' autocomplete functions, but when he tried anything more complex it would “fail catastrophically.” Then in March, while on vacation with his family, he set the newly released Claude Code to work on one of his hobby projects. It completed a four-hour task in two minutes, and the code was better than what he would have written.

“I was like, Whoa,” he says. “That, for me, was the moment, really. There's no going back from here.” Dilley has since cofounded a startup called DevSwarm, which is creating software that can marshal multiple agents to work in parallel on a piece of software.

The challenge, says Armin Ronacher, a prominent open-source developer, is that the learning curve for these tools is shallow but long. Until March he'd remained unimpressed by AI tools, but after leaving his job at the software company Sentry in April to launch a startup, he started experimenting with agents. “I basically spent a lot of months doing nothing but this,” he says. “Now, 90% of the code that I write is AI-generated.”

Getting to that point involved extensive trial and error, to figure out which problems tend to trip the tools up and which they can handle efficiently. Today's models can tackle most coding tasks with the right guardrails, says Ronacher, but these can be very task and project specific.

To get the most out of these tools, developers must surrender control over individual lines of code and focus on the overall software architecture, says Nico Westerdale, chief technology officer at the veterinary staffing company IndeVets. He recently built a data science platform 100,000 lines of code long almost exclusively by prompting models rather than writing the code himself.

Westerdale's process starts with an extended conversation with the modelagent to develop a detailed plan for what to build and how. He then guides it through each step. It rarely gets things right on the first try and needs constant wrangling, but if you force it to stick to well-defined design patterns, the models can produce high-quality, easily maintainable code, says Westerdale. He reviews every line, and the code is as good as anything he's ever produced, he says: “I've just found it absolutely revolutionary,. It's also frustrating, difficult, a different way of thinking, and we're only just getting used to it.”

But while individual developers are learning how to use these tools effectively, getting consistent results across a large engineering team is significantly harder. AI tools amplify both the good and bad aspects of your engineering culture, says Ryan J. Salva, senior director of product management at Google. With strong processes, clear coding patterns, and well-defined best practices, these tools can shine. 

But if your development process is disorganized, they'll only magnify the problems. It's also essential to codify that institutional knowledge so the models can draw on it effectively. “A lot of work needs to be done to help build up context and get the tribal knowledge out of our heads,” he says.

The cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has been vocal about its adoption of AI tools. CEO Brian Armstrong made headlines in August when he revealed that the company had fired staff unwilling to adopt AI tools. But Coinbase's head of platform, Rob Witoff, tells MIT Technology Review that while they've seen massive productivity gains in some areas, the impact has been patchy. For simpler tasks like restructuring the code base and writing tests, AI-powered workflows have achieved speedups of up to 90%. But gains are more modest for other tasks, and the disruption caused by overhauling existing processes often counteracts the increased coding speed, says Witoff.

One factor is that AI tools let junior developers produce far more code,. As in almost all engineering teams, this code has to be reviewed by others, normally more senior developers, to catch bugs and ensure it meets quality standards. But the sheer volume of code now being churned out i whichs quickly saturatinges the ability of midlevel staff to review changes. “This is the cycle we're going through almost every month, where we automate a new thing lower down in the stack, which brings more pressure higher up in the stack,” he says. “Then we're looking at applying automation to that higher-up piece.”

Developers also spend only 20% to 40% of their time coding, says Jue Wang, a partner at Bain, so even a significant speedup there often translates to more modest overall gains. Developers spend the rest of their time analyzing software problems and dealing with customer feedback, product strategy, and administrative tasks. To get significant efficiency boosts, companies may need to apply generative AI to all these other processes too, says Jue, and that is still in the works.

Programming with agents is a dramatic departure from previous working practices, though, so it's not surprising companies are facing some teething issues. These are also very new products that are changing by the day. “Every couple months the model improves, and there's a big step change in the model's coding capabilities and you have to get recalibrated,” says Anthropic's Cherny.

For example, in June Anthropic introduced a built-in planning mode to Claude; it has since been replicated by other providers. In October, the company also enabled Claude to ask users questions when it needs more context or faces multiple possible solutions, which Cherny says helps it avoid the tendency to simply assume which path is the best way forward.

Most significant, Anthropic has added features that make Claude better at managing its own context. When it nears the limits of its working memory, it summarizes key details and uses them to start a new context window, effectively giving it an “infinite” one, says Cherny. Claude can also invoke sub-agents to work on smaller tasks, so it no longer has to hold all aspects of the project in its own head. The company claims that its latest model, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, can now code autonomously for more than 30 hours without major performance degradation.

Novel approaches to software development could also sidestep coding agents' other flaws. MIT professor Max Tegmark has introduced something he calls “vericoding,” which could allow agents to produce entirely bug-free code from a natural-language description. It builds on an approach known as “formal verification,” where developers create a mathematical model of their software that can prove incontrovertibly that it functions correctly. This approach is used in high-stakes areas like flight-control systems and cryptographic libraries, but it remains costly and time-consuming, limiting its broader use.

Rapid improvements in LLMs' mathematical capabilities have opened up the tantalizing possibility of models that produce not only software but the mathematical proof that it's bug free, says Tegmark. “You just give the specification, and the AI comes back with provably correct code,” he says. “You don't have to touch the code. You don't even have to ever look at the code.”

When tested on about 2,000 vericoding problems in Dafny—a language designed for formal verification—the best LLMs solved over 60%, according to non-peer-reviewed research by Tegmark's group. This was achieved with off-the-shelf LLMs, and Tegmark expects that training specifically for vericoding could improve scores rapidly.

And counterintuitively, Tthe speed at which AI generates code could actuallylso ease maintainability concerns. Alex Worden, principal engineer at the business software giant Intuit, notes that maintenance is often difficult because engineers reuse components across projects, creating a tangle of dependencies where one change triggers cascading effects across the code base. Reusing code used to save developers time, but in a world where AI can produce hundreds of lines of code in seconds, that imperative has gone, says Worden.

Instead, he advocates for “disposable code,” where each component is generated independently by AI without regard for whether it follows design patterns or conventions. They are then connected via APIs—sets of rules that let components request information or services from each other. Each component's inner workings are not dependent on other parts of the code base, making it possible to rip them out and replace them without wider impact, says Worden. 

“The industry is still concerned about humans maintaining AI-generated code,” he says. “I question how long humans will look at or care about code.”

For the foreseeable future, though, humans will still need to understand and maintain the code that underpins their projects. And one of the most pernicious side effects of AI tools may be a shrinking pool of people capable of doing so. 

Early evidence suggests that fears around the job-destroying effects of AI may be justified. A recent Stanford University study found that employment among software developers aged 22 to 25 fell nearly 20% between 2022 and 2025, coinciding with the rise of AI-powered coding tools.

Experienced developers could face difficulties too. Luciano Nooijen, an engineer at the video-game infrastructure developer Companion Group, used AI tools heavily in his day job, where they were provided for free. But when he began a side project without access to those tools, he found himself struggling with tasks that previously came naturally. “I was feeling so stupid because things that used to be instinct became manual, sometimes even cumbersome,” says Nooijen.

Just as athletes still perform basic drills, he thinks the only way to maintain an instinct for coding is to regularly practice the grunt work. That's why he's largely abandoned AI tools, though he admits that deeper motivations are also at play. 

Part of the reason Nooijen and other developers MIT Technology Review spoke to are pushing back against AI tools is a sense that they are hollowing out the parts of their jobs that they love. “I got into software engineering because I like working with computers. I like making machines do things that I want,” Nooijen says. “It's just not fun sitting there with my work being done for me.” 

The sunshine vitamin could affect your immune system and heart health.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you'll see it's a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won't compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","The AI doomers feel undeterred","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/15/1129171/the-ai-doomers-feel-undeterred/","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

But they certainly wish people were still taking their warnings really seriously.

It's a weird time to be an AI doomer.

This small but influential community of researchers, scientists, and policy experts believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity. Though many of these people would be more likely to describe themselves as advocates for AI safety than as literal doomsayers, they warn that AI poses an existential risk to humanity. They argue that absent more regulation, the industry could hurtle toward systems it can't control. They commonly expect such systems to follow the creation of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a slippery concept generally understood as technology that can do whatever humans can do, and better. 

This story is part of MIT Technology Review's Hype Correction package, a series that resets expectations about what AI is, what it makes possible, and where we go next.

Though this is far from a universally shared perspective in the AI field, the doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration, organizing prominent calls for international “red lines” to prevent AI risks, and getting a bigger (and more influential) megaphone as some of its adherents win science's most prestigious awards.

But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects' worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they're building. 

And then there was the August release of OpenAI's latest foundation model, GPT-5, which proved something of a letdown. Maybe that was inevitable, since it was the most hyped AI release of all time; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had boasted that GPT-5 felt “like a PhD-level expert” in every topic and told the podcaster Theo Von that the model was so good, it had made him feel “useless relative to the AI.” 

Many expected GPT-5 to be a big step toward AGI, but whatever progress the model may have made was overshadowed by a string of technical bugs and the company's mystifying, quickly reversed decision to shut off access to every old OpenAI model without warning. And while the new model achieved state-of-the-art benchmark scores, many people felt, perhaps unfairly, that in day-to-day use GPT-5 was a step backward. 

All this would seem to threaten some of the very foundations of the doomers' case. In turn, a competing camp of AI accelerationists, who fear AI is actually not moving fast enough and that the industry is constantly at risk of being smothered by overregulation, is seeing a fresh chance to change how we approach AI safety (or, maybe more accurately, how we don't). 

This is particularly true of the industry types who've decamped to Washington: “The Doomer narratives were wrong,” declared David Sacks, the longtime venture capitalist turned Trump administration AI czar. “This notion of imminent AGI has been a distraction and harmful and now effectively proven wrong,” echoed the White House's senior policy advisor for AI and tech investor Sriram Krishnan. (Sacks and Krishnan did not reply to requests for comment.) 

(There is, of course, another camp in the AI safety debate: the group of researchers and advocates commonly associated with the label “AI ethics.” Though they also favor regulation, they tend to think the speed of AI progress has been overstated and have often written off AGI as a sci-fi story or a scam that distracts us from the technology's immediate threats. But any potential doomer demise wouldn't exactly give them the same opening the accelerationists are seeing.)

So where does this leave the doomers? As part of our Hype Correction package, we decided to ask some of the movement's biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. Are they frustrated that policymakers no longer seem to heed their threats? Are they quietly adjusting their timelines for the apocalypse? 

Recent interviews with 20 people who study or advocate AI safety and governance—including Nobel Prize winner Geoffrey Hinton, Turing Prize winner Yoshua Bengio, and high-profile experts like former OpenAI board member Helen Toner—reveal that rather than feeling chastened or lost in the wilderness, they're still deeply committed to their cause, believing that AGI remains not just possible but incredibly dangerous. 

At the same time, they seem to be grappling with a near contradiction. While they're somewhat relieved that recent developments suggest AGI is further out than they previously thought (“Thank God we have more time,” says AI researcher Jeffrey Ladish), they also feel angry that people in power are not taking them seriously enough (Daniel Kokotajlo, lead author of a cautionary forecast called “AI 2027,” calls the Sacks and Krishnan tweets “deranged and/or dishonest”). 

Broadly speaking, these experts see the talk of an AI bubble as no more than a speed bump, and disappointment in GPT-5 as more distracting than illuminating. They still generally favor more robust regulation and worry that progress on policy—the implementation of the EU AI Act; the passage of the first major American AI safety bill, California's SB 53; and new interest in AGI risk from some members of Congress—has become vulnerable as Washington overreacts to what doomers see as short-term failures to live up to the hype. 

Some were also eager to correct what they see as the most persistent misconceptions about the doomer world. Though their critics routinely mock them for predicting that AGI is right around the corner, they claim that's never been an essential part of their case: It “isn't about imminence,” says Berkeley professor Stuart Russell, the author of Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control. Most people I spoke with say their timelines to dangerous systems have actually lengthened slightly in the last year—an important change given how quickly the policy and technical landscapes can shift. 

“If someone said there's a four-mile-diameter asteroid that's going to hit the Earth in 2067, we wouldn't say, 'Remind me in 2066 and we'll think about it.'”

Many of them, in fact, emphasize the importance of changing timelines. And even if they are just a tad longer now, Toner tells me that one big-picture story of the ChatGPT era is the dramatic compression of these estimates across the AI world. For a long while, she says, AGI was expected in many decades. Now, for the most part, the predicted arrival is sometime in the next few years to 20 years. So even if we have a little bit more time, she (and many of her peers) continue to see AI safety as incredibly, vitally urgent. She tells me that if AGI were possible anytime in even the next 30 years, “It's a huge fucking deal. We should have a lot of people working on this.”

So despite the precarious moment doomers find themselves in, their bottom line remains that no matter when AGI is coming (and, again, they say it's very likely coming), the world is far from ready. 

Maybe you agree. Or maybe you may think this future is far from guaranteed. Or that it's the stuff of science fiction. You may even think AGI is a great big conspiracy theory. You're not alone, of course—this topic is polarizing. But whatever you think about the doomer mindset, there's no getting around the fact that certain people in this world have a lot of influence. So here are some of the most prominent people in the space, reflecting on this moment in their own words. 

Interviews have been edited and condensed for length and clarity. 

The biggest change in the last few years is that there are people who are hard to dismiss who are saying this stuff is dangerous. Like, [former Google CEO] Eric Schmidt, for example, really recognized this stuff could be really dangerous. He and I were in China recently talking to someone on the Politburo, the party secretary of Shanghai, to make sure he really understood—and he did. I think in China, the leadership understands AI and its dangers much better because many of them are engineers.

I've been focused on the longer-term threat: When AIs get more intelligent than us, can we really expect that humans will remain in control or even relevant? But I don't think anything is inevitable. There's huge uncertainty on everything. We've never been here before. Anybody who's confident they know what's going to happen seems silly to me. I think this is very unlikely but maybe it'll turn out that all the people saying AI is way overhyped are correct. Maybe it'll turn out that we can't get much further than the current chatbots—we hit a wall due to limited data. I don't believe that. I think that's unlikely, but it's possible. 

I also don't believe people like Eliezer Yudkowsky, who say if anybody builds it, we're all going to die. We don't know that. 

But if you go on the balance of the evidence, I think it's fair to say that most experts who know a lot about AI believe it's very probable that we'll have superintelligence within the next 20 years. [Google DeepMind CEO] Demis Hassabis says maybe 10 years. Even [prominent AI skeptic] Gary Marcus would probably say, “Well, if you guys make a hybrid system with good old-fashioned symbolic logic … maybe that'll be superintelligent.” [Editor's note: In September, Marcus predicted AGI would arrive between 2033 and 2040.]

And I don't think anybody believes progress will stall at AGI. I think more or less everybody believes a few years after AGI, we'll have superintelligence, because the AGI will be better than us at building AI.

So while I think it's clear that the winds are getting more difficult, simultaneously, people are putting in many more resources [into developing advanced AI]. I think progress will continue just because there's many more resources going in.

Some people thought that GPT-5 meant we had hit a wall, but that isn't quite what you see in the scientific data and trends.

There have been people overselling the idea that AGI is tomorrow morning, which commercially could make sense. But if you look at the various benchmarks, GPT-5 is just where you would expect the models at that point in time to be. By the way, it's not just GPT-5, it's Claude and Google models, too. In some areas where AI systems weren't very good, like Humanity's Last Exam or FrontierMath, they're getting much better scores now than they were at the beginning of the year.

At the same time, the overall landscape for AI governance and safety is not good. There's a strong force pushing against regulation. It's like climate change. We can put our head in the sand and hope it's going to be fine, but it doesn't really deal with the issue.

The biggest disconnect with policymakers is a misunderstanding of the scale of change that is likely to happen if the trend of AI progress continues. A lot of people in business and governments simply think of AI as just another technology that's going to be economically very powerful. They don't understand how much it might change the world if trends continue, and we approach human-level AI. 

Like many people, I had been blinding myself to the potential risks to some extent. I should have seen it coming much earlier. But it's human. You're excited about your work and you want to see the good side of it. That makes us a little bit biased in not really paying attention to the bad things that could happen.

Even a small chance—like 1% or 0.1%—of creating an accident where billions of people die is not acceptable. 

I hope the idea that talking about existential risk makes you a “doomer” or is “science fiction” comes to be seen as fringe, given that most leading AI researchers and most leading AI CEOs take it seriously. 

There have been claims that AI could never pass a Turing test, or you could never have a system that uses natural language fluently, or one that could parallel-park a car. All these claims just end up getting disproved by progress.

People are spending trillions of dollars to make superhuman AI happen. I think they need some new ideas, but there's a significant chance they will come up with them, because many significant new ideas have happened in the last few years. 

My fairly consistent estimate for the last 12 months has been that there's a 75% chance that those breakthroughs are not going to happen in time to rescue the industry from the bursting of the bubble. Because the investments are consistent with a prediction that we're going to have much better AI that will deliver much more value to real customers. But if those predictions don't come true, then there'll be a lot of blood on the floor in the stock markets.

However, the safety case isn't about imminence. It's about the fact that we still don't have a solution to the control problem. If someone said there's a four-mile-diameter asteroid that's going to hit the Earth in 2067, we wouldn't say, “Remind me in 2066 and we'll think about it.” We don't know how long it takes to develop the technology needed to control superintelligent AI.

Looking at precedents, the acceptable level of risk for a nuclear plant melting down is about one in a million per year. Extinction is much worse than that. So maybe set the acceptable risk at one in a billion. But the companies are saying it's something like one in five. They don't know how to make it acceptable. And that's a problem.

I think people definitely overcorrected in their response to GPT-5. But there was hype. My recollection was that there were multiple statements from CEOs at various levels of explicitness who basically said that by the end of 2025, we're going to have an automated drop-in replacement remote worker. But it seems like it's been underwhelming, with agents just not really being there yet.

I've been surprised how much these narratives predicting AGI in 2027 capture the public attention. When 2027 comes around, if things still look pretty normal, I think people are going to feel like the whole worldview has been falsified. And it's really annoying how often when I'm talking to people about AI safety, they assume that I think we have really short timelines to dangerous systems, or that I think LLMs or deep learning are going to give us AGI. They ascribe all these extra assumptions to me that aren't necessary to make the case. 

I'd expect we need decades for the international coordination problem. So even if dangerous AI is decades off, it's already urgent. That point seems really lost on a lot of people. There's this idea of “Let's wait until we have a really dangerous system and then start governing it.” Man, that is way too late.

I still think people in the safety community tend to work behind the scenes, with people in power, not really with civil society. It gives ammunition to people who say it's all just a scam or insider lobbying. That's not to say that there's no truth to these narratives, but the underlying risk is still real. We need more public awareness and a broad base of support to have an effective response.

If you actually believe there's a 10% chance of doom in the next 10 years—which I think a reasonable person should, if they take a close look—then the first thing you think is: “Why are we doing this? This is crazy.” That's just a very reasonable response once you buy the premise.

When I got into the space, AI safety was more of a set of philosophical ideas. Today, it's a thriving set of subfields of machine learning, filling in the gulf between some of the more “out there” concerns about AI scheming, deception, or power-seeking and real concrete systems we can test and play with. 

“I worry that some aggressive AGI timeline estimates from some AI safety people are setting them up for a boy-who-cried-wolf moment.”

AI governance is improving slowly. If we have lots of time to adapt and governance can keep improving slowly, I feel not bad. If we don't have much time, then we're probably moving too slow.

I think GPT-5 is generally seen as a disappointment in DC. There's a pretty polarized conversation around: Are we going to have AGI and superintelligence in the next few years? Or is AI actually just totally all hype and useless and a bubble? The pendulum had maybe swung too far toward “We're going to have super-capable systems very, very soon.” And so now it's swinging back toward “It's all hype.”

I worry that some aggressive AGI timeline estimates from some AI safety people are setting them up for a boy-who-cried-wolf moment. When the predictions about AGI coming in 2027 don't come true, people will say, “Look at all these people who made fools of themselves. You should never listen to them again.” That's not the intellectually honest response, if maybe they later changed their mind, or their take was that they only thought it was 20 percent likely and they thought that was still worth paying attention to. I think that shouldn't be disqualifying for people to listen to you later, but I do worry it will be a big credibility hit. And that's applying to people who are very concerned about AI safety and never said anything about very short timelines.

In the last year, two big things updated my AGI timelines. 

First, the lack of high-quality data turned out to be a bigger problem than I expected. 

Second, the first “reasoning” model, OpenAI's o1 in September 2024, showed reinforcement learning scaling was more effective than I thought it would be. And then months later, you see the o1 to o3 scale-up and you see pretty crazy impressive performance in math and coding and science—domains where it's easier to sort of verify the results. But while we're seeing continued progress, it could have been much faster.

All of this bumps up my median estimate to the start of fully automated AI research and development from three years to maybe five or six years. But those are kind of made up numbers. It's hard. I want to caveat all this with, like, “Man, it's just really hard to do forecasting here.”

Thank God we have more time. We have a possibly very brief window of opportunity to really try to understand these systems before they are capable and strategic enough to pose a real threat to our ability to control them.

But it's scary to see people think that we're not making progress anymore when that's clearly not true. I just know it's not true because I use the models. One of the downsides of the way AI is progressing is that how fast it's moving is becoming less legible to normal people. 

Now, this is not true in some domains—like, look at Sora 2. It is so obvious to anyone who looks at it that Sora 2 is vastly better than what came before. But if you ask GPT-4 and GPT-5 why the sky is blue, they'll give you basically the same answer. It is the correct answer. It's already saturated the ability to tell you why the sky is blue. So the people who I expect to most understand AI progress right now are the people who are actually building with AIs or using AIs on very difficult scientific problems.

AI policy seems to be getting worse, like the “Pro-AI” super PAC [launched earlier this year by executives from OpenAI and Andreessen Horowitz to lobby for a deregulatory agenda], and the deranged and/or dishonest tweets from Sriram Krishnan and David Sacks. AI safety research is progressing at the usual pace, which is excitingly rapid compared to most fields, but slow compared to how fast it needs to be.

We said on the first page of “AI 2027” that our timelines were somewhat longer than 2027. So even when we launched AI 2027, we expected there to be a bunch of critics in 2028 triumphantly saying we've been discredited, like the tweets from Sacks and Krishnan. But we thought, and continue to think, that the intelligence explosion will probably happen sometime in the next five to 10 years, and that when it does, people will remember our scenario and realize it was closer to the truth than anything else available in 2025. 

Predicting the future is hard, but it's valuable to try; people should aim to communicate their uncertainty about the future in a way that is specific and falsifiable. This is what we've done and very few others have done. Our critics mostly haven't made predictions of their own and often exaggerate and mischaracterize our views. They say our timelines are shorter than they are or ever were, or they say we are more confident than we are or were.

I feel pretty good about having longer timelines to AGI. It feels like I just got a better prognosis from my doctor. The situation is still basically the same, though.

Garrison Lovely is a freelance journalist and the author of Obsolete, an online publication and forthcoming book on the discourse, economics, and geopolitics of the race to build machine superintelligence (out spring 2026). His writing on AI has appeared in the New York Times, Nature, Bloomberg, Time, the Guardian, The Verge, and elsewhere. 

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you'll see it's a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won't compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people's political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

With just 10 days to go until we inch ever closer to the end of Stranger Things, Netflix has released a new trailer for the show's penultimate batch of episodes. Which means it's high time for the show, its audience, and its characters alike to start wondering: just what the hell is the Upside Down, anyway?

We've known it's been coming since the Duffer brothers started teasing it in the run-up to the first part of Stranger Things‘ fifth and final season, but our first proper look at volume 2 definitely wants you to know that definitive answers as to just what the mysterious other plane of existence that is the Upside Down is are coming. Oh, and maybe the end of life as our heroes know it, but what's that next to some good old-fashioned mystery teasing?

Appropriately set to a remix of Diana Ross' “Upside Down” (what else, at this point?), the new trailer sees the scattered kids begin to enact their plans to stop and kill Vecna, from Eleven recruiting some help from Eight (the returning Linnea Berthelsen), to Will recovering from the shocking events of part one that saw him learn how to tap into Vecna's powers. Meanwhile, the main man of the hour himself is messing around with poor Holly Wheeler and waxing lyrical about the new world he wants to build out of the ashes of the old one.

Stopping that, of course, might need a few dramatic sacrifices to be made, so it's probably not going to help fans' concerns over which of their faves might not make it to the end that we even get a nice big death flag tease for Dustin and Steve here, as they promise that if they're going out, they're going out together.

Hopefully that won't be the case, but we've only got 10 more days before we find out: the second volume of Stranger Things season 5 will hit Netflix as a bonus present under your tree on December 25, before the show goes out with a bang in theaters and on the streamer on New Year's Eve.

If vacuums and other floor cleaning machines aren't at the top of your holiday shopping list, consider this: All the company walking across your floors, all the wrapping paper and tape and little bits of packing material, all the crumbs from the snacks and big holiday meals ….  In short, your carpets and hard-surfaced floors are in for a serious barrage of debris.

Eureka, of course, is way ahead of the game here. Their vacuums have been picking up holiday messes for over 100 years, all the way back to 1922, and they've got your back this year. Six of Eureka's top cleaning machines are marked down for their Christmas sale, ranging from the super-smart E20 Evo Plus robot cleaning machine to the amazingly lightweight and versatile ReactiSense 451 stick vacuum that cleans much more than just your floors. Eureka's Christmas sale is your best chance to save hundreds of dollars while saving your floors from all that holiday fallout.

The E20 Evo Plus is your go-to deal if you want to save $100 while delegating your floor cleaning duties entirely to a super-smart robot that uses LiDAR to dodge obstacles, larger wheels to scale thresholds of up to 20mm, advanced anti-hair tangling technology, and more.

The E20 Evo Plus brings a super-powerful 10,000Pa of suction to your floors to remove both large, heavy debris and tiny particles from carpets and hard floors. The self-emptying charging base is bagless, and has a 45-day capacity so you're likely emptying it fewer than 10 times per year. The anti hair-tangling brush and DragonClaw Side Brush combine for a 98% hair removal rate, ideal for homes with pets. And the E20 Evo Plus's mop head automatically lifts when the robot moves from a hard surface to carpet in order to keep the wetness and dirt away.

Easy to use, easy to maintain, and now at an even better price — the Eureka E20 Evo Plus is one of the best holiday home deals of the year.

The E20 Plus is Eureka's upgraded successor to the ultra-popular E10s, with boosted cleaning performance anti-tangle capability, and obstacle avoidance. It comes with a bagless self-emptying charging dock similar to the E20 Evo Plus, with multi-cyclonic technology to help separate 98% of the dust and dirt before they reach the unit's filter, thus greatly extending the filter's lifespan and preventing clogs.

The 8,000Pa of suction power is a 100% improvement over the E10s, and the DuoDetect AI 3D Obstacle Avoidance uses a dual-line laser that acts as the robot's eyes and helps it intelligently cut a clear path around obstacles that trap lesser robot vacs. An anti hair-tangling brush means there's even less need for human intervention or maintenance than ever before.

It's may not be hard to find vacuums that can reach into tight places, and it may not be hard to find vacuums with excellent suction. But finding one that checks both of those boxes is rare, and finding one like the Eureka FlexReach that's only $136 during this Christmas sale event is nearly impossible.

The FlexReach extends its powerful 192AW of suction with an ingenious design that includes a Quick Lift detachable pod that allows you to bring its cleaning power to above-floor areas — stairs, upholstery and furniture, those cobwebby corners, and more. With the pod attached, the main body can turn 80 degrees in either direction, or lay flat to reach beneath furniture and other hard-to-reach areas. The LED headlights show you the dust bunnies that have eluded lesser vacuums, right before the FlexReach makes quick work of them.

The Eureka FlexReach is a rare combination of flexible reach, pro-level power, and a $136 sale price that's unbeatable.

See Eureka FlexReach Upright at Amazon

The RapidClean Pro is everything you could ask for in a stick vacuum — lightweight, powerful, versatile, loaded with a long-lasting rechargeable battery, and priced for everyone at just $110 during Eureka's Christmas sale event.

The 90W of suction power combined with multi-surface versatility makes the RapidClean Pro an enticing buy for apartment residents and other small-home denizens, although its 40 minute cleaning time on a single charge means it can also tackle larger spaces. The XL Dust Cup has a 5-stage filtration system so all of the dust and dirt stays sealed inside until it's time to use the one-click emptying feature. The RapidClean Pro comes with a 2-in-1 furniture brush and crevice tool so you can take advantage of its lightweight and ergonomic design to use it above the floor.

See Eureka RapidClean Pro Stick at Amazon

A longer 50-minute runtime on a single charge and a tangle-resistant brush, combined with a formidable 20.3Kpa of suction, should move the ReactiClean 410 rechargeable stick vacuum to the head of the list for pet owners.

An upgraded 200W brushless motor provides the dirt-busting power, and it's lightweight and easily handled, so you can remove the brushroll and use the ReactiClean 410 way above floor level, or attach the upholstery brush to give your furniture a thorough cleaning. But that Tangle-Resistant Brush will be your best friend when you're using the ReactiClean 410 on carpeted and hard floors to remove as much fur as your pets decide to shed.

See Eureka ReactiClean 410 Stick at Amazon

Nobody really wants to vacuum all day long, but it's nice to know that if you really need to do a hardcore cleaning binge, the Eureka ReactiSense 451 rechargeable stick vacuum has your back. The 60-minute runtime on a single charge is among the best on the market, and it's a full hour of 350W suction power that will leave your living space spotless.

It's also a full hour of smart cleaning, because the ReactiSense has intelligent Smart Sense+React sensors that detect the amount of dirt or debris and automatically adjusts the suction and brush speed to compensate, and once captured, the dirt stays sealed in the cup behind an H13 HEPA filter that captures 99.95% of microparticles. The anti-tangle nozzle and brushroll keeps pet hair from bringing the vacuum to a halt.

You know a brand has recognition when its name is practically synonymous with its product. Take Kleenex or Band-Aid, for example. iRobot, the makers of the Roomba robovac that arguably started the craze around disc-shaped autonomous vacuums, is now being consumed by its own vacuum manufacturing partner. No product can stand on brand recognition alone, especially not when every other company is selling the same thing for cheaper.

On Sunday, iRobot, the company that has long owned the Roomba brand of robovacuums, declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In its press release, the company said it was selling itself off to its contract manufacturer, Picea Robotics. iRobot promised that it was trying to finish its Chapter 11 “reorganization” proceedings by February 2026 and says current Roomba users won't face any immediate service disruptions.

If you have a short memory, you may not remember when iRobot tried to sell itself to Amazon. That deal imploded due to European regulators in early 2024, leaving the company stranded like a Roomba trapped under a shelving unit in the corner of a room. iRobot had already sent most of its manufacturing overseas after its Amazon deal died, which is how Picea came into the picture.

Based in Shenzhen, China, Picea Robotics is a broader manufacturing partner of several major brands that make robovacuums, including Shark and Anker (through its Eufy sub-brand). In the press release, iRobot said Picea has sold more than 20 million robovacs in its lifetime, which is notable since the company (which is also listed as 3irobotix) was founded in 2016, according to its LinkedIn page. The 3i brand also has its own line of vacuums.

Picea may simply take the Roomba brand name as its own and then start shipping its own vacuums with the logo stamped on them. The best Roomba models were always the ones without a lot of flair. They did the job by snacking on all the rogue dust bunnies around your main floor. iRobot's latest vacuums included weird inventions such as the Roomba Combo 10 Max with added features that let it clean its own mop and empty its bin. That device cost $1,300, so maybe there's a reason iRobot wasn't seeing such great returns. Roomba had also tried innovating with robovacuums with automatic pet treat dispensers, which would inevitably only create more mess that the vacuum would be forced to clean up later.

The home robotics field is already saturated with China-based brands, such as Eufy, Ecovacs, Dreame, and Roborock. Hell, now we even have drone-maker DJI entering the fray. One of Roborock's latest “innovations” had it shove a robotic arm into a vacuum with its Saros Z70. Unfortunately, the robotic appendage didn't perform well in real-life scenarios. There's only so much innovation you can do with this form factor, so much so that IFA 2025 was full of mecha suits for vacuums to help them climb stairs. Some, like Ecovacs, have tried sticking an AI chatbot into the vacuum, in case you wanted to talk with your roving dust sweeper.

All these unnecessary additions don't necessarily make for a better robot vacuum. Our favorite robot vacuum of the year was the big, blocky, yet charming Matic Robot Vacuum. Simply put, it had the most accurate mapping and computer vision capabilities without needing a cloud connection. For the sake of an autonomous vacuum and mop, do you really need anything more?

Buildings can leak a lot of heat. Scientists think the remedy might come in the form of fireproof, transparent “Bubble Wrap.”

Physicists at the University of Colorado Boulder have developed a new material called the Mesoporous Optically Clear Heat Insulator, or MOCHI for short. Unlike the name, MOCHI is no dessert—it's a nearly transparent, long-lasting silicon gel that insulates so well, you could hold a flame on your palm without getting burned. Sounds unlikely? Here's the video evidence, courtesy of the team:

Scaled up, MOCHI could be a thin sheet applied to windows to make buildings more energy efficient, according to a recent Science paper on the material. Further down the line, MOCHI could also appear in “applications ranging from extraterrestrial habitats to lightweight apparel,” Ivan Smalyukh, study senior author and a physicist at CU Boulder, told Gizmodo in an email.

MOCHI appears flat and transparent on the surface, but zoomed in, the material is actually a collection of tiny pores thinner than the width of a human hair, according to the paper. The secret to MOCHI's insulating abilities lies within these small air bubbles, which trap incoming or outgoing heat within their networks.

This mechanism is similar to aerogels, which NASA uses to insulate its Mars rovers. However, the air-trapping bubbles in aerogels are typically scattered throughout the material and reflect light, giving the final material a cloudy appearance.

By contrast, MOCHI reflects around 0.2% of incoming light. About 90% of the material is air, making the material almost completely transparent, Smalyukh explained. For one of their experiments, Smalyukh and colleagues applied MOCHI to a cold window and found that doing so stopped roughly 95% of heat transfer, somewhat like high-performance building roofs and walls—but transparent, he added.

According to Smalyukh, a major motivation for this project was the not-so-ideal energy efficiency of buildings worldwide. Specifically, buildings consume around 40% of energy worldwide, but poor insulation often leads to heat leaks that increase how much energy residents use to keep themselves comfortable, he said.

By contrast, most existing insulation materials are opaque and look unattractive when used on windows or building exteriors. MOCHI was devised to address both issues.

“Suitable building materials and technologies could allow for comfortable indoor environments at no or minimal energy consumption,” he said. “Thus, windows may finally even acquire new functions, well beyond what they are known for throughout the millennia of uses.”

That said, MOCHI is still under development, as fabrication still takes quite a long time, the researchers admitted in a statement. But the team is hopeful. MOCHI ingredients are on the cheaper side, which “bodes well” for bringing the product to markets, Smalyukh said in the statement.

The team also sees much potential for MOCHI as a solution for energy sustainability. For instance, MOCHI could be repurposed as solar panels for buildings, especially in climate zones with limited access to sunlight, Smalyukh explained.

As of now, the researchers continue to test and refine their product. It's also led to some interesting moments, like using MOCHI as a miniature grill to cook some sausages.

Amazon's most powerful CPU to date.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


This month, Amazon Web Services introduced the Graviton5, its fifth-generation custom general-purpose server processor, designed to compete against industry-standard CPUs from AMD and Intel in AWS's data centers. The new processor extends AWS's in-house Arm-based CPU program with a CPU that packs up to 192 cores and 180 MB of L3 cache, and is designed to compete with higher-end AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon processors, potentially replacing some of them in AWS data centers.

The AWS Graviton5 processor is fabricated using a 3nm-class process, likely by TSMC. The processor integrates 192 Neoverse V3 cores alongside an assumed 180 MB L3 cache. AWS says that the new CPU will deliver 25% higher performance compared to its predecessor, which appears to be conservative, as the Graviton5 offers a twofold increase in the number of cores. The chip uses the Armv9.2 ISA that brings several microarchitecture enhancements and a fivefold increase in L3 cache size.

 




The new processor is now available in Amazon EC2 M9g instances in preview, while compute-optimized C9g and memory-focused R9g variants are scheduled for launch in 2026. The current EC2 M9g instances are up to 30% faster for databases, up to 35% faster for web applications, and up to 35% faster for machine learning workloads compared to M8g, according to AWS.

Amazon Web Services is intentionally opaque about the exact specifications and internal design of its Graviton5 CPU. Nonetheless, it offers comparisons with the previous-generation Graviton4 chip, which allows us to decode some details and delve into them with a little more depth.

AWS and Arm officially confirm that Graviton5 integrates 192 Neoverse V3 cores per package, fabricated using a 3nm-class process, making it the densest CPU in the Graviton lineup and the densest Armv9.2 processor available to date. The internal layout of the processor has been redesigned to reduce communication overhead, and AWS claims up to 33% lower inter-core latency, which is particularly noteworthy given the twofold increase in core count.

 




When we discuss Neoverse V3, we cannot help but think about the Arm-developed compute subsystems (CSS). While Arm confirmed that we are dealing with Neoverse V3, neither Amazon nor Arm has confirmed that Graviton5 uses Arm-developed CSS. That means we're likely dealing with a unique design in Graviton 5.

In performance comparisons between the Neoverse V3 core and its predecessor, Arm claims a 9%-16% uplift over Neoverse V2 across general cloud workloads and up to 84% in AI data analytics. This is one of the reasons why AWS is so conservative about performance upticks, both for Graviton5 as well as compute-intensive M9g instances in general. Another reason for AWS's conservative performance estimate is that it does not sell leading-edge performance like AMD or Nvidia, but rather predictable performance per dollar and scalability in the cloud. Nonetheless, with a 192-core processor, AWS puts itself into the highest league among CPU developers.

One interesting thing to note about Graviton5 is that it comes with L3 cache, not system-level cache like Graviton4. While L3 and SLC in data center CPUs have a lot in common, they are not the same thing. Traditionally, L3 cache is a last-level cache located inside each compute tile or core cluster in a data center CPU. L3 primarily serves CPU workloads by reducing DRAM access; it is optimized for low latency and directly participates in the core's coherence protocol. Therefore, L3 is tightly coupled to the cores and is physically close to them.

 




By contrast, SLC sits outside the core clusters on the SoC fabric and is shared by all CPU cores, various other accelerators, I/O devices, NICs, and DMA engines. It tends to be much larger (often 100–300+ MB) and optimized for throughput rather than latency, as it acts as a global buffer that reduces pressure on DRAM and provides coherent access for heterogeneous compute blocks. SLC can improve scaling for very high core counts and enables unified memory semantics across CPUs, GPUs, and on-die accelerators, a role traditional L3 caches cannot fulfill on their own.

Amazon has not publicly explained the design decision, but based on Graviton4's architecture and what we know about Graviton5, the reason is almost certainly architectural scalability. The move from SLC in Graviton4 to a large 180 MB L3 in Graviton5 is not cosmetic; it reflects fundamental changes in how a 192-core processor moves data, manages latency, and maintains coherence.

Graviton4's architecture — 96 Neoverse V2 cores, a CMN-700 mesh, 12 DDR5-5600 channels — operates efficiently with a centralized or semi-centralized SLC. But doubling the core count to 192 dramatically increases mesh traffic, hop distances, and contention on any unified cache structure. At this scale, a monolithic SLC could almost certainly become a latency bottleneck and would not support AWS's claim of up to 33% lower inter-core communication latency. A distributed L3 sliced across the die allows hot data to remain physically close to compute clusters, reducing average access latency and improving overall coherence behavior.

The fivefold cache expansion AWS advertises reinforces this architectural necessity. Scaling Graviton4's 36 MB SLC by that factor yields 180 MB, and AWS's additional statement —2.6X more cache per core, at double the core count — implies ~187 MB total, which aligns with a large, multi-slice L3 rather than a single SLC block, which would create routing complexity.

Finally, L3-based designs offer stronger multi-tenant performance predictability, which is crucial for AWS. Under cloud workloads, shared caches experience heavy cross-tenant interference and variable latency, so when designing cache subsystems, developers must take into account AWS's use case. To sum things up, the shift to a distributed L3 was a necessary architectural evolution for Graviton5.

Just as AWS didn't disclose many details about other design aspects of Graviton5, it also didn't disclose much about the memory subsystem of the CPU. It goes without saying that Graviton5's memory subsystem is more powerful than that of Graviton4, as it supports higher memory speeds, which likely means that it at least retains a 12-channel memory subsystem of the Graviton4, but with higher data transfer rates (i.e., higher than DDR5-5600).

A 12-channel DDR5 design operating at 6400 MT/s would provide around 614 GB/s of aggregate bandwidth, which translates to approximately 3.2 GB/s per core, which is actually lower than 5.6 GB/s per core in the case of Graviton4. However, the larger L3 cache could compensate for this decrease in memory bandwidth. Then again, we do not know the exact number of memory channels supported by Graviton5.

Input/output throughput is similarly increased, according to AWS: network bandwidth is up by 15% on average across instance sizes, with as much as double the throughput for the largest configurations. Storage bandwidth through Amazon EBS rises by around 20% on average, according to AWS. These gains are designed to improve performance not only for compute-heavy applications, but also for distributed systems that depend on fast storage and networking.

On the security side, Graviton5 is built on the AWS Nitro System, with sixth-generation Nitro Cards that handle virtualization, networking, and storage. AWS has also introduced a new component called the Nitro Isolation Engine, which the company describes as a formally verified isolation layer. Instead of relying solely on conventional security validation, the Isolation Engine uses mathematical proofs to demonstrate that workloads are separated from each other and from AWS operators. The architecture enforces a zero-operator-access model, and AWS plans to allow customers to review the implementation and the formal proofs behind it to ensure maximum security. Such security measures could be a part of the company's effort to attract clients who have traditionally used on-prem servers.

AWS's new Graviton5 processor offers a 192-core, 3nm Arm-based CPU with around 180 MB of L3 cache. This positions the cloud giant as a competitor to the high-end AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon solutions for data centers. The CPU integrates Neoverse V3 cores and delivers an advertised 25% performance uplift, which is conservative given the twofold increase in core count, large microarchitectural improvements in the Armv9.2 ISA, and a fivefold increase in cache capacity. Also, AWS confirms 33% lower inter-core latency due to a redesigned internal layout but has not disclosed whether it uses Arm's CSS, suggesting that Graviton5 may be a unique Annapurna Labs design built around Neoverse V3 cores.

A key architectural shift is replacing Graviton4's SLC with a large distributed L3 to enable better coherence scaling across 192 cores and predictable latency. The processor also gains a faster memory subsystem (likely retaining 12 channels at higher DDR5 speeds), improved network and storage bandwidth, and the new Nitro Isolation Engine, which uses formal verification to guarantee tenant isolation and enforce zero-operator access.

At present, Graviton5 powers new EC2 M9g instances — up to 30% – 35% faster for databases, web services, and machine learning — and compute-optimized C9g and memory-optimized R9g variants will follow in 2026.

Users report Copilot appearing after a recent software update, with no option to uninstall.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


LG smart TV owners are reporting that a recent webOS software update has added Microsoft Copilot to their TVs, with no apparent way to remove it. Reports first surfaced over the weekend on Reddit, where a post showing a Copilot tile pinned to an LG TV home screen climbed to more than 35,000 upvotes on r/mildlyinfuriating, accompanied by hundreds of comments from users describing the same behavior.

According to affected users, Copilot appears automatically after installing the latest webOS update on certain LG TV models. The feature shows up on the home screen alongside streaming apps, but unlike Netflix or YouTube, it cannot be uninstalled.

LG has previously confirmed plans to integrate Microsoft Copilot into webOS as part of its broader “AI TV” strategy. At CES 2025, the company described Copilot as an extension of its AI Search experience, designed to answer questions and provide recommendations using Microsoft's AI services. In practice, the iteration of Copilot currently seen on LG TVs appears to function as a shortcut to a web-based Copilot interface rather than a fully native application like the one described by LG.

The issue, for many, isn't necessarily what Copilot does, but that it has been forced onto consumers with no option to remove it. LG's own support documentation notes that certain preinstalled or system apps cannot be deleted, only hidden. Users who encounter Copilot after the update report that this limitation applies, leaving them with no way to fully remove the feature once it has been added. It's a similar story on rival models, for instance some Samsung TV's include Gemini.

The overwhelmingly negative reaction from users indicates a growing frustration with AI features being imposed on consumers in every way possible. Smart TVs have naturally become platforms for advertising, data collection, and now AI services, with updates adding new functionality that owners did not explicitly request and, in most cases, do not want. While LG allows users to disable some AI-related options, such as voice recognition and personalization features, those settings do not remove the Copilot app itself.

Ultimately, those wanting to minimize Copilot's presence on their TVs are limited to keeping it disconnected from the Internet. That's about the most that can be done at the moment, unless LG backtracks and either allows users to disable or completely uninstall the app in response to backlash, which seems unlikely.

Implementing a mobile app (DermLoop) with a removable dermatoscope for acquiring high‑quality photos of the skin enabled primary care providers (PCPs) to manage skin problems via online consultations (e-consults) and reduced the need for in‑person visits to dermatologists.

“With access to dermatology care unlikely to improve in the near future, particularly for medically underserved populations, programs such as this provide an effective means to expand access to care and reduce inequality in healthcare,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Lauren Bifulco of Weitzman Institute in Middletown, Connecticut. It was published online on December 8, 2025, in Journal of Primary Care & Community Health.

The results may not apply to health systems new to the approach of e-consults. Researchers could not determine whether the experience, training, age, and practice setting of the PCPs influenced the findings.

This research did not receive any specific funding. Various authors reported serving as the president of Confirmed, the CEO of MelaTech, and a consultant for MelaTech.

In patients with excess weight awaiting colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery, a low-energy total diet replacement (TDR) program was feasible, well tolerated, and associated with greater preoperative weight loss and improvements in some patient-reported symptoms than usual care.

“An intensive preoperative weight-loss intervention was safe, feasible, and likely cost-effective as part of prehabilitation before colorectal cancer surgery with evidence of improvements in key symptoms,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study, led by Dimitrios A. Koutoukidis, PhD, Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, England, was published online on December 8 in JAMA Network Open.

This study was underpowered to precisely detect differences in secondary and exploratory outcomes. Patients in the usual care group lost about 2 kg, and most reported conscious efforts to lose weight, which may reflect a halo effect of their participation in a weight-loss study rather than usual care. More frequent dietitian contact in the intervention arm may have increased adverse event reporting.

This study received funding from the University of Oxford and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR). Several authors reported receiving support from multiple organizations including NIHR, the Pharsalia Trust UK, and Cancer Research UK Advanced Clinical Scientist Fellowship. Two authors reported receiving nonfinancial support from Nestlé Health Science, Oviva, and Second Nature outside of the submitted work.

In patients who experienced an acute myocardial infarction (MI), an increased volume of epicardial adipose tissue — the layer of fat between the heart muscle and the outer heart lining — was associated with an increased extent of myocardial injury after MI.

“MI occurs at a relatively late stage in the development of coronary artery disease, and it may be possible to intervene earlier in the process, identifying patients with elevated [epicardial adipose tissue] volume and modulating effects as a preventive measure,” concluded Alexander Schulz, senior author of the study.

This study was presented by Clara Hagedorn of University Hospital Göttingen in Göttingen, Germany, at the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) 2025 on December 12.

No limitations were explicitly mentioned in this press release.

The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) has accepted givinostat (Duvyzat) for restricted use in NHS Scotland for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients aged 6 years or older.  

The recommendation covers patients who are still able to walk when therapy begins, even if they later lose ambulation during treatment.

DMD is a rare, severe genetic condition affecting approximately 2500 individuals in the UK. An estimated 80-100 children in Scotland are living with the disorder.

The X-linked recessive condition stems from mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin, a protein essential for muscle cell strength and stability. Children typically experience declining muscle strength from as early as 2 years old, often needing wheelchairs by age 11-12 years and ventilatory assistance by their late teens.

Givinostat is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, though the exact way it benefits patients with DMD is not fully understood. In DMD, loss of dystrophin destabilises muscle fibres, leading to chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and adipogenesis. HDAC activity is abnormally high in these cells, which drives changes that suppress muscle regeneration pathways. 

Givinostat helps muscle cells repair and regenerate by correcting this abnormal activity. It reduces inflammation, limits fibrosis and fatty infiltration, and supports the natural repair processes of muscle tissue.

The recommended starting dose varies based on body weight, ranging from 22.2 mg to 53.2 mg administered orally twice daily.

The SMC advice relied on the phase 3 EPIDYS study, which enrolled ambulant male patients aged 6 years or older with genetically confirmed DMD who could complete functional assessments. Participants received either givinostat or placebo, both combined with corticosteroid therapy, for 18 months.

The primary endpoint measured changes in four-stair climb time, a functional assessment of muscle performance. Treatment with givinostat demonstrated a meaningful 14% reduction in deterioration compared with placebo.

Common treatment-related adverse events included decreased platelet count or thrombocytopenia, increased blood triglyceride levels, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Monitoring of triglyceride levels, blood counts, platelets, and electrocardiograms is recommended, with dose adjustments managing most side effects.

The SMC recognised givinostat as addressing a significant unmet need in DMD, where no curative therapies exist. Current management relies on physiotherapy, corticosteroids, and supportive care.

Clinical experts highlighted givinostat's novel mechanism of action and ability to delay loss of walking ability.

The advice applies only in the context of an approved NHS Scotland Patient Access Scheme, which the SMC said delivers cost-effective results. Implementation will require intensive monitoring, increasing the frequency of medicine reviews compared with current practice of 6-monthly visits and annual blood tests.

The SMC advice was welcomed by Duchenne UK as a “significant breakthrough” for patients in Scotland. The charity's chief executive Emily Reuben called for the treatment to be “urgently approved” for use in England and Wales by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.

MRI is often used in the diagnostic workup ahead of breast cancer surgery, but new data from a phase III trial suggest the practice is unnecessary for many patients with early-stage disease.

The findings, presented at San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) 2025, show that adding preoperative breast MRI to diagnostic mammography had no impact on 5-year locoregional recurrence among patients with early-stage hormone receptor-negative (HR-negative) cancer.

Other outcomes, including distant recurrence-free survival and overall survival, were also similar whether patients received pre-op MRI or not.

The assumption has been that MRI catches disease missed by mammography and that removing any additional lesions reduces locoregional recurrences, but that has never been convincingly shown, presenter Isabelle Bedrosian, MD, breast cancer surgeon at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, told Medscape Medical News. 

There is still “clearly room” for pre-op MRI, Bedrosian said, such as for women who have a high-risk germline mutations or when mammography results are ambiguous. 

But, she said, “it should not be done routinely for every new breast cancer patient.”

The findings are based on 319 patients newly diagnosed with stage I or II HR-negative breast cancer who were eligible for lumpectomy and randomized equally to either mammography alone or mammography with MRI within 30 days.

The trial focused on patients with HR-negative disease due to their higher risk for recurrence, Bedrosian noted. Most patients (72%) had stage I tumors, and 93% were clinically node negative. Just less than 20% were HER2-positive.

At a median follow-up of 61 months, 93.2% of patients in the MRI arm and 95.7% with no MRI were free of locoregional recurrence. Distant recurrence-free survival was 94.2% with MRI and 94.4% without it, whereas overall survival was 92.9% with MRI vs 91.4% without.

The results held when the analysis was limited to patients with triple-negative and HER2-positive disease, as well as the small number of women younger than 50 at diagnosis — a group often thought to benefit the most from MRI because they are more likely to have dense breast tissue.

Bedrosian pointed out that pre-op MRI often leads to more biopsies and workups that delay surgery, increase mastectomy rates, and add to patient anxiety and costs — all of which could be worth it if patients' long-term outcomes were improved.

But the data suggest otherwise. A 2023 randomized trial from Brazil reached similar conclusions, with pre-op MRI having no impact on local recurrence, overall survival, or reoperation rates — though it did increase mastectomies by 8%.

“I'm hopeful that as these data are internalized by the breast cancer community, we will start pulling back some of the MRIs that we're doing,” Bedrosian said. “It's the routine, reflexive use of this modality that's an issue here.”

Some experts discussing the results at SABCS agreed. Carlos Arteaga, MD, who moderated a press briefing, said he was not surprised by the findings.

Mammography and ultrasound — which almost all the women in this trial had, although it wasn't mandated — are likely enough to find high-risk lesions that need to be removed, said Arteaga, breast medical oncologist at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.

Adjuvant treatment is probably sufficient to clear the small, low-risk lesions that MRI often detects, he added.

Gaorav Gupta, MD, PhD, radiation oncologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, made similar points. “We often get false positives with MRIs, or you end up doing additional procedures for very low-risk lesions,” he said. “The evidence is not really there to say that it benefits patients.”

Not everyone shared that take, however. “I don't see this trial as practice-changing,” said trial discussant Bruce Mann, MBBS, PhD, breast surgeon at the University of Melbourne in Melbourne, Australia.

He told Medscape that the trial was underpowered to detect a small but clinically relevant benefit from pre-op MRI. It was powered for an 8% reduction in locoregional recurrence with MRI; Mann argued that a 3% target would have been more realistic but would require many more patients.

He also noted imbalances between the arms that might have put MRI at a disadvantage. For example, MRI patients were younger and trended towards lower use of chemotherapy.

Those issues, Mann said, “make it hard to generalize about anything.”

The National Cancer Institute funded the work. The speakers had no relevant disclosures.

The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has issued positive opinions for two biosimilars that could expand access for clinicians treating retinal disease and chronic inflammatory conditions: Ranluspec (Lupin Europe GmbH) for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and other retinal disorders, and Gotenfia (Stada Arzneimittel AG) for multiple autoimmune indications. 

Both products now advance toward European Commission approval and, if authorized, are expected to offer lower‑cost alternatives to established originator biologics.

Ranluspec contains ranibizumab as its active substance and is highly similar to the reference product Lucentis, which was authorized in the European Union in 2007. It is recommended for the full range of VEGF‑A-mediated retinal diseases authorized for the reference product, including wet AMD, diabetic macular edema, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion.

Ranibizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment that inhibits VEGF-A, a key mediator of angiogenesis. By blocking it, ranibizumab prevents the formation of abnormal blood vessels in the retina, reducing vascular leakage and inflammation, and stabilizing vision in diseases such as wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy.

The approval is based on comprehensive clinical data confirming that Ranluspec demonstrates comparable safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity to Lucentis. It will be available as a 10-mg/mL solution for intravitreal injection and should be administered by ophthalmologists experienced in intravitreal technique.

A phase 3 trial conducted in India with 202 patients confirmed that Ranluspec performed equivalently to Lucentis in terms of visual acuity outcomes, with more than 99% of patients losing fewer than 15 letters on the visual acuity scale.

In a real-world safety analysis, data from 1400 eyes and more than 2000 injections supported the safety profile, with adverse events occurring predominantly as mild and nonserious, such as ocular pain and transient vision blurring. The biosimilar also showed a favorable immunogenicity profile, with 4.95% of patients developing antidrug antibodies compared with 12.87% in the Lucentis group.

The biosimilar offers potential cost savings of approximately 35%-50% compared with Lucentis, which could influence hospital procurement and formulary decisions.

Gotenfia is a biosimilar to golimumab, which was authorized in the EU in 2009 for treating multiple autoimmune diseases. The CHMP recommended it for the same spectrum of indications as the reference product, including:

Golimumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody targeting TNF-alpha. By binding TNF-alpha, Gotenfia reduces key inflammatory markers, including CRP, interleukin 6, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, matrix metalloproteinase 3, and VEGF. 

Clinical studies confirmed that Gotenfia has equivalent efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity profiles to the originator. The favorable opinion was based on a thorough evaluation of the complete body of evidence, including extensive analytical, nonclinical, and clinical data. It will be available as prefilled syringes in 50-mg and 100-mg doses; treatment must be initiated under the supervision of a qualified healthcare provider.

Both biosimilars demonstrate how the EMA is broadening access to critical therapies through approvals of high-quality, safe, and cost-effective alternatives to originator biologics. Once authorized, the Summary of Product Characteristics, package leaflets, and assessment reports will be published in all official EU languages.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in adults aged 45 years or older was significantly linked to a higher risk for specific and serious cardiovascular events such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke over the following year, with the risk being similar to that observed after influenza infection; the risk was evident within the first 30 days after infection.

""This study should prompt heightened clinical vigilance for cardiovascular complications following RSV infection and reinforces the public health rationale for preventive measures, most notably vaccination, in older adult populations to mitigate this burden,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Anders Hviid, MSc, DrMedSci, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark. It was published online on December 08, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

Because the study was conducted in a relatively homogeneous population of Denmark within a universal healthcare system, the findings may not generalise to other settings. Unmeasured lifestyle or sociodemographic factors could have influenced the results. Some RSV infections in the control group likely went undetected.

No specific funding was reported in this study. Several authors reported receiving grants and presentation, consulting, or lecture fees from foundations and various pharmaceutical companies, and one author reported serving on the scientific board of VAC4EU.

A nurse practitioner (NP)-led remote patient monitoring (RPM) program for uninsured patients with diabetes achieved a mean reduction of 3.3 percentage points in A1c levels, with the sharpest decline observed in the first 3 months, according to a study.

“Overall, the findings of this initiative support the value of continued nursing advocacy and policy initiatives to address the disparities in access to technology and interventions that contribute to poor health outcomes among underserved populations with diabetes,” the authors of the study wrote, concluding that “insights gained through initial stages of implementation of an RPM program indicate that barriers to self-monitoring of BG [blood glucose] can be addressed and that glycemic control in a vulnerable population can improve through remote monitoring and telehealth follow-up by a team of NPs.”

The study was led by Alison Hernandez, PhD, MPH, RN, School of Nursing, The University of Alabama at Birmingham. It was published online on November 20, 2025, in The Journal for Nurse Practitioners.

Communication challenges posed significant barriers, with nearly 75% of nonparticipating enrollees being unreachable by telephone. The authors of the study noted that fidelity checks of adherence to the protocol for weekly chart reviews and follow-up calls were not conducted in this quality improvement project. Additionally, the lack of a control group in this project restricted conclusions about its efficacy.

The study received partial funding from The University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital and Health System Foundation. The authors of the study declared having no relevant conflicts of interest.

A large meta-analysis suggests that vaping is not cardiovascularly neutral, with elevated heart attack risk concentrated among people who previously smoked, raising questions about e-cigarettes as harm-reduction tools.



Study: Are electronic cigarettes associated with the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke? A systematic review and meta-analysis. Image Credit: magnet studio / Shutterstock

In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal BMC Public Health, researchers investigated the association between electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. The study pooled data from 12 observational studies involving large population samples to examine whether vaping is linked to cardiovascular outcomes while accounting for conventional cigarette smoking.

Analyses showed that e-cigarette users had 53% higher odds of MI compared with non-users. Notably, among former cigarette smokers who currently use e-cigarettes, the odds of a heart attack were more than doubled. These findings raise concerns about the cardiovascular safety of e-cigarettes and indicate that they should not be assumed to be risk-free alternatives.

For decades, cigarette smoking has been recognized as a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, hypertension, and stroke. In response, the tobacco industry introduced electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), commonly referred to as e-cigarettes or “vapes,” and promoted them as harm-reduction tools to aid smoking cessation.

These devices aerosolize nicotine-containing liquids that typically include propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, and flavoring agents. When heated, propylene glycol can generate aldehydes and other reactive compounds that are known contributors to cardiovascular disease.

Despite rapid global uptake, the cardiovascular safety of e-cigarettes remains controversial. Human studies have produced conflicting results, with some suggesting lower risk for exclusive vapers, while others were limited by cross-sectional designs, residual confounding by smoking history, or potential industry-related conflicts of interest.

As a result, a comprehensive analysis that carefully accounts for conventional cigarette smoking is needed to clarify the independent cardiovascular risks associated with vaping.

The present study addressed this gap using a systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) conducted in accordance with the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Conventional cigarette smoking was treated as a key confounder and subgroup variable.

Researchers searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies published between January 2005 and June 2025. Eligible studies included observational designs and randomized trials involving human participants that reported the prevalence or incidence of MI or stroke.

Studies with reported financial ties to the tobacco industry were excluded to minimize bias. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 430,875 participants for MI analyses and more than 1.1 million participants for stroke analyses.

Random-effects models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to quantify associations between e-cigarette use and cardiovascular outcomes.

Overall, e-cigarette use was associated with a 53% higher odds of MI compared with non-use (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.17–1.89). After adjustment for cigarette smoking, the association remained statistically significant but attenuated (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11–1.37).

Former cigarette smokers who currently use e-cigarettes had a 2.52-fold higher odds of MI compared with non-users (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.88–3.16). The authors note that this may reflect residual confounding or cumulative effects of prior smoking rather than a direct causal effect of vaping alone.

Stroke outcomes were less consistent. Overall, e-cigarette users showed no statistically significant increase in stroke risk (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.91–1.19), and smoking-adjusted analyses were similarly non-significant.

However, among former smokers who currently use e-cigarettes, stroke odds were significantly higher at 73% above non-users (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.30–2.15).

Among exclusive e-cigarette users who had never smoked combustible cigarettes, no significant association was observed for MI (OR 0.96) or stroke (OR 0.97). These estimates were based on limited data and may be affected by misclassification of smoking status.

This systematic review suggests that e-cigarette use is associated with increased odds of myocardial infarction, particularly among individuals with a history of cigarette smoking. Although exclusive vaping among never-smokers was not associated with statistically significant cardiovascular risk in this analysis, the elevated risk observed among former smokers raises concerns about the use of e-cigarettes as harm-reduction or transition tools.

Most included studies were cross-sectional, limiting causal inference, and substantial heterogeneity, publication bias, and residual confounding remain important limitations. The authors conclude that further high-quality longitudinal studies are required and that e-cigarettes should not be considered harmless from a cardiovascular perspective.

Researchers in Sweden are testing whether a brain-healthy MIND diet can be realistically adopted by adults with obesity, laying the groundwork for future trials linking diet, gut health, and mental well-being.

In a recent study protocol published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition, researchers described an ongoing investigation into whether a Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet is practical, acceptable, and feasible for adults with obesity.

The results of this study will provide feasibility data and preliminary evidence to inform future trials examining links among diet, the gut microbiome, mental health, and obesity, thereby guiding strategies to promote physical and psychological well-being.

Mental health disorders and obesity frequently occur together and contribute substantially to both personal suffering and public health costs. The pathways linking these conditions remain unclear, but growing evidence suggests diet plays a meaningful role in both weight management and emotional well-being.

In Sweden, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has steadily increased over the past two decades, particularly among young adults. More than half of Swedish adults are now above a healthy weight, with marked differences across sex, country of birth, and education levels. These trends underscore the need for preventive strategies that address both physical and mental health.

Diet-induced weight loss has been associated with improved mood in people with obesity, but psychological benefits may also arise through diet–microbiota interactions. Dietary patterns shape the gut microbiome, which is involved in metabolic regulation and stress- and mood-related pathways.

The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet prioritizes foods rich in antioxidants, fiber, and healthy fats that support cognitive and gut health. Rather than fully combining Mediterranean and DASH diets, the MIND diet selectively emphasizes components thought to benefit brain and metabolic health. If shown to be practical and acceptable, this pattern may support weight loss and mental well-being in Sweden.

The MIND-GUT study is a randomized clinical trial with two arms: a MIND-diet intervention group and a control group receiving standard healthy-eating advice. A total of 126 adults aged 25 to 50 years with obesity will be recruited from primary care clinics and the community in the Västra Götaland Region of Sweden. The sample size allows robust feasibility estimates while accounting for expected dropout.

Participants must have a body mass index (BMI) of at least 30 kg/m², internet access, and willingness to complete all procedures. If recruitment is challenging, the BMI threshold may be lowered to 27 kg/m². Exclusion criteria include conditions or treatments that could interfere with dietary change, gut microbiota composition, or mental health outcomes, such as use of weight-loss medication, diabetes, or polycystic ovary syndrome. Ethical approval was obtained, and informed consent procedures emphasized privacy and autonomy.

At baseline and at 12 weeks, trained staff will collect physical measurements including weight, height, body composition, blood pressure, and waist and hip circumferences. Participants will complete online questionnaires assessing demographics, lifestyle behaviors, psychosocial well-being, eating attitudes, gut symptoms, and dietary intake.

Mental health outcomes are assessed using validated self-report instruments measuring anxiety, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress rather than clinical diagnoses. Adherence is measured using a simplified food checklist targeting key MIND diet components at baseline, week 6, and week 12.

Intervention participants receive a structured MIND-diet meal plan emphasizing leafy greens, berries, olive oil, whole grains, legumes, nuts, poultry, and fish. Daily energy intake is capped at 2,300 kcal for men and 1,900 kcal for women. Control participants receive standard dietary advice aligned with Swedish guidelines without targeted MIND components.

Both groups are encouraged to limit alcohol and avoid soft drinks, and both receive regular reminders, newsletters, and consultations to support retention. After 12 weeks, participants complete qualitative interviews exploring acceptability, barriers, and suggestions for improvement.

Participants provide stool samples at baseline, week 6, and week 12 to capture microbiome dynamics. Samples are stored at home and deferred if there is a recent illness, fever, diarrhea, or antibiotic use that could affect results. Laboratory processing is randomized to reduce batch effects.

Primary outcomes include adherence, retention, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes include changes in gut microbiota, anxiety, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, weight, fat mass, waist-to-hip ratio, and BMI. Analyses are exploratory and intended to inform future efficacy trials.

This protocol evaluates whether a MIND-diet–based intervention can be realistically implemented in adults with obesity, a necessary step before scaling interventions targeting both physical and mental health.

If feasible, this approach could inform personalized dietary strategies and public health policies promoting brain-healthy eating. By integrating diet quality, emotional well-being, and gut microbiota, the study aims to provide foundational evidence for future large-scale trials addressing multiple dimensions of obesity-related health.

New research shows that 1 in 4 children with major traumatic injury do not receive care in a pediatric trauma center, where outcomes are generally better than in adult centers. The authors of the study, published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.250625, recommend evidence-based strategies to improve care for this vulnerable age group.

""Given the strong evidence of improved clinical outcomes associated with care in pediatric trauma centers, access to these centers in Canada must be improved urgently,"" writes Dr. Lynne Moore, professor, Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, Quebec, with coauthors. ""Since most severely injured children first present to nonpediatric hospitals, the most effective strategies lie in strengthening decision support in prehospital environments and nonpediatric hospitals, not in costly new infrastructure.""

Researchers found that in a study across 9 Canadian provinces over 5 years (2016 to 2021), 3007 children were admitted to an acute care hospital with major traumatic injuries. Of these, 2335 (77%) were directly transported (879, 29%) or transferred (1456, 48%) to a pediatric trauma center.

Pediatric trauma centers offer specialized health care and support for the specific physical and psychological needs of children and their families.

Variability in access to pediatric trauma centers exists, with higher access in Alberta and Manitoba than in Ontario, and lower access in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and the Atlantic provinces.

The authors suggest that provincial trauma systems integrate evidence-based strategies to improve access to pediatric care. A standardized prehospital triage tool adapted to pediatric patients, pediatric readiness assessments for nonpediatric hospitals, and teleconsultation pathways between referring hospitals and pediatric centers are some strategies.

""Immediate implementation of evidence-based strategies to improve care for children with major trauma, coupled with targeted research and national data coordination, would save lives and provide more equitable trauma care for children in Canada, regardless of where they live,"" the authors conclude.

Dementia is a group of disorders that gradually impair memory, thinking and daily functioning. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, affects about 7.2 million Americans aged 65 and older in 2025. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), while rarer, is the second most common cause of early-onset dementia, often striking people in their 40s to 60s.

Although both diseases damage the brain, they do so in distinct ways. AD primarily affects memory and spatial awareness, while FTD targets regions responsible for behavior, personality and language. Because their symptoms can overlap, it often leads to misdiagnosis. Distinguishing between them is not just a scientific challenge but a clinical necessity, as accurate diagnosis can profoundly affect treatment, care and quality of life.

MRI and PET scans are effective for diagnosing AD but are costly, time-consuming and require specialized equipment. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a portable, non-invasive and affordable alternative by measuring brain activity with sensors across various frequency bands. However, signals are often noisy and vary between individuals, making analysis difficult. Even with machine learning applications to EEG data, results are inconsistent and differentiating AD from FTD remains difficult.

To tackle this issue, researchers from the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University have created a deep learning model that detects and evaluates AD and FTD. It boosts EEG accuracy and interpretability by analyzing both frequency- and time-based brain activity patterns linked to each disease.

The results of the study, published in the journal Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, found that slow delta brain waves were an important biomarker for both AD and FTD, mainly in the frontal and central regions of the brain. In AD, brain activity was more widely disrupted, also affecting other regions of the brain and frequency bands like beta, indicating more extensive brain damage. These differences help explain why AD is typically easier to detect than FTD.

The model achieved more than 90% accuracy in distinguishing individuals with dementia (AD or FTD) from cognitively normal participants. It also predicted disease severity with relative errors of less than 35% for AD and 15.5% for FTD.

Because AD and FTD share similar symptoms and brain activity, telling them apart was difficult. Using feature selection, the researchers boosted the model's specificity – how well it identified people without the disease – from 26% to 65%. Their two-stage design – first detecting healthy individuals, then separating AD from FTD – achieved 84% accuracy, ranking among the best EEG-based methods so far.

The model merges convolutional neural networks and attention-based LSTMs to detect both the type and severity of dementia from EEG data. Grad-CAM shows which brain signals influenced the model, helping clinicians understand its decisions. This approach offers a new view of how brain activity evolves and which regions and frequencies drive diagnosis – something traditional tools rarely capture.

What makes our study novel is how we used deep learning to extract both spatial and temporal information from EEG signals. By doing this, we can detect subtle brainwave patterns linked to Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia that would otherwise go unnoticed. Our model doesn't just identify the disease – it also estimates how severe it is, offering a more complete picture of each patient's condition.""

Tuan Vo, first author and doctoral student in the FAU Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science

The findings also revealed that AD tends to be more severe, impacting a wider range of brain areas and leading to lower cognitive scores, while FTD's effects are more localized to the frontal and temporal lobes. These insights align with previous neuroimaging studies but add new depth by showing how these patterns appear in EEG data – an inexpensive and noninvasive diagnostic tool.

""Our findings show that Alzheimer's disease disrupts brain activity more broadly, especially in the frontal, parietal and temporal regions, while frontotemporal dementia mainly affects the frontal and central areas,"" said Hanqi Zhuang, Ph.D., co-author and associate dean and professor, FAU Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. ""This difference explains why Alzheimer's is often easier to detect. However, our work also shows that careful feature selection can significantly improve how well we distinguish FTD from Alzheimer's.""

Overall, the study shows that deep learning can streamline dementia diagnosis by combining detection and severity assessment in one system, cutting down on lengthy evaluations and giving clinicians real-time tools to track disease progression.

This work demonstrates how merging engineering, AI and neuroscience can transform how we confront major health challenges. With millions affected by Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia, breakthroughs like this open the door to earlier detection, more personalized care, and interventions that can truly improve lives.""

Swapping common snack foods for a modest daily portion of tree nuts curbed cravings for sweets and fast foods and lifted diet quality scores in young adults with early cardiometabolic risk, without weight gain or adverse metabolic effects.



Study: Consuming Tree Nuts Daily as Between-Meal Snacks Reduces Food Cravings and Improves Diet Quality in American Young Adults at High Metabolic Syndrome Risk. Image Credit: volartman / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, a group of researchers tested whether replacing typical high-carbohydrate snacks with tree nuts reduces food cravings and improves diet quality among young adults in the United States at elevated metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk.

One in three American young adults shows a cardiometabolic warning sign, and snacks now add about 200 to 300 extra kilocalories daily. Cookies, chips, and sugary drinks are cheap and everywhere, but small swaps can change habits. Nutrient-dense snacks like nuts, fruit, and yogurt are rich in fiber, unsaturated fats, and minerals. Diet quality, as measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), is associated with lower risks of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) link nut snacking to higher HEI scores. Further research should test whether structured nut snacking reduces cravings and improves HEI scores in at-risk youth.

Young adults were screened for at least one MetS risk factor and enrolled if weight-stable, with body mass index (BMI) 24.5 to 34.9 kg/m² and age 22 to 36 years. After a two-week run-in on a standardized eucaloric menu, participants were randomized in a parallel, single-blind design to twice-daily tree-nut or high-carbohydrate snacks for sixteen weeks.

Menus were created in the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR) to provide three meals and two snacks (25 to 35% fat, 45 to 55% carbohydrate, 15 to 20% protein); snack energy was 15 to 20% of daily energy needs, estimated from resting energy expenditure and activity.

Tree-nut snacks were a 33.5-gram mix of unsalted almonds, walnuts, pecans, macadamia nuts, hazelnuts, pistachios, and cashews; comparators were unsalted pretzels, animal crackers, graham crackers, and granola-type bars matched for energy, protein, fiber, and sodium.

Food cravings were measured with the Food Craving Inventory (FCI); intake with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) 24-hour multi-pass recall; food frequency with the Rapid Eating Assessment for Participants (REAP); and diet quality with the HEI-2015. Fasting blood assessed glucose by enzymatic assay and insulin, ghrelin, glucagon, and adiponectin by radioimmunoassay, with total glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) also measured. Fullness was rated on visual analog scales (VAS). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, after the run-in period, and at the end of the sixteen-week intervention. Within-group change used Wilcoxon tests; between-group change used general linear models.

Eighty-four participants completed the intervention (40 tree-nut; 44 high-carbohydrate), with a mean age of 28.5 years and a mean BMI of 28.4 kg/m². Groups were comparable at baseline with respect to age, sex, BMI, activity, MetS risk score, energy intake, and macronutrient distribution.

After sixteen weeks, the tree-nut group reported broad, specific reductions in cravings. Item-level scores declined for cookies (−0.63 ± 1.03), brownies (−0.45 ± 0.71), donuts (−0.40 ± 0.90), candy (−0.33 ± 0.92), ice cream (−0.55 ± 1.08), chips (−0.33 ± 1.03), and pizza (−0.33 ± 0.57), with significant decreases in the FCI high-sweet and fast-food subscales. In contrast, the high-carbohydrate group showed no significant reductions in any craving subscale.

Preference for sweet taste also fell among tree-nut participants (−12.5% reporting “sweet” preference). Behavior followed desire: the tree-nut group reduced the weekly frequency of frozen desserts (−0.18 ± 0.64) and salty snacks (−0.41 ± 0.88) and increased the frequency of higher-protein servings, including seafood and plant proteins (a modeled increase equivalent to roughly +4.37 daily servings in cup equivalents, rather than an absolute intake level). Only one notable dietary change occurred in the high-carbohydrate group, a decrease in fruit servings.

Diet quality improved meaningfully with tree nuts. HEI total score rose from 52.0 ± 17.1 to 62.0 ± 12.2 (mean change +10.01; about +19%). Gains were driven by higher fatty-acid scores (+4.33 ± 4.09), higher protein scores (+0.70 ± 1.71), better sodium scores (+2.20), and improved refined-grain scores; the dairy component fell modestly. No HEI category improved in the high-carbohydrate group, and total HEI was unchanged.

Regression modeling indicated that about half of the variance in HEI change was explained by increased tree-nut intake, higher intake of mono- and polyunsaturated fats, more high-protein servings, and lower salty-snack frequency and sodium intake, after adjusting for sex, age, and baseline BMI.

Physiology is aligned with eating patterns. In the tree-nut group, total GLP-1 increased (144.2 ± 57.5 to 160.6 ± 55.7 pg/mL) as did total ghrelin; rises in total GLP-1 were associated inversely with cravings for cake (r = −0.35), brownies (r = −0.44), candy (r = −0.36), and ice cream (r = −0.33). Despite a decrease in total food mass consumed, energy intake showed no statistically significant change. Body weight remained stable with tree nuts, and VAS ratings of hunger and fullness did not change. Adiponectin concentrations declined significantly in both groups over the intervention period, a finding of uncertain short-term clinical significance.

By contrast, the high-carbohydrate group increased energy intake by about 349 kilocalories per day and gained approximately 0.78 kilograms, alongside trends toward more hunger and less fullness. Fasting glucose and insulin were unchanged in both groups over 16 weeks, indicating that appetite and quality shifts occurred without short-term changes in glycemia.

Because the trial was single-blind and relied heavily on self-reported cravings and dietary intake, some expectancy or reporting bias cannot be excluded. Altogether, substituting tree nuts for typical snacks curbed cravings for calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods, nudged choices toward protein-rich, nutrient-dense options, and raised HEI scores in young adults at metabolic risk.

In young adults with early cardiometabolic risk, structured tree-nut snacking reduced cravings for sweets and fast foods, shifted choices away from frozen desserts and salty snacks, and raised HEI scores by roughly 19% without changing weight. Rises in GLP-1 were associated with lower cravings, consistent with a potential gut-brain signaling role rather than a demonstrated causal mechanism. Replacing high-carbohydrate staples with a modest portion of mixed nuts is a pragmatic step households can take to improve diet quality, while clinicians can pair this swap with counseling emphasizing seafood and plant proteins. Findings may not generalize to older adults, individuals with established metabolic disease, or populations outside the controlled feeding context. Larger, longer trials should test durability, nut-type specificity, and broader generalizability.

A comprehensive review of human studies reveals that kefir can alter certain gut and oral bacteria. However, inconsistent results and small trials mean its true health impact remains an open scientific question.

Study: The Effects of Kefir on the Human Oral and Gut Microbiome. Image credit: xamnesiacx84/Shutterstock.com

Scientists have recently reviewed the existing literature on the effects of kefir consumption on health and published their findings in Nutrients. Kefir consumption may be associated with alterations in the balance of the microbiota within specific niches, which could support digestive, immune, and metabolic health.

Kefir is a probiotic milk drink that traces its origins to the Caucasus Mountains, dating back more than 3,000 years. It is made with kefir grains, which are complex, symbiotic clusters of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), acetic acid bacteria (AAB), and yeast held together in a polysaccharide matrix. When added to milk, these grains trigger a fermentation process that thickens the milk and gives it a slight sour taste. Although kefir is primarily made from cow's milk, it can also be prepared from goat or sheep milk and soymilk.

Commercially, kefir is produced by inoculating milk with kefir grains at a ratio of 1:30 to 1:50; then fermenting for up to 24 hours at room temperature. After filtering out the grains, the newly produced kefir can be consumed immediately or stored at low temperatures for later use.

The health benefits of kefir largely depend on the substrate used for fermentation. A key challenge in kefir research is its inherent compositional variability, which can vary significantly across numerous factors, including starter-grain microbiota, fermentation time, and temperature. These variables shape the final blend of microbial species, their relative abundances, and the levels of bioactive metabolites in the beverage.

In kefir research, findings from one study may not directly translate to another, as different kefir preparations can affect the oral microbiome in distinct ways. Therefore, evidence regarding changes in the gut and oral microbiome after kefir consumption can vary widely.

LAB, such as Lentilactobacillus kefiri, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Lactococcus lactis, ferment milk substrates by metabolizing lactose and producing lactic acid. In addition to lactic acid, these microbes generate bacteriocins, cathelicidin, carbon dioxide, acetaldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide, which have the potential to attenuate or eliminate common enteric pathogens.

L. kefiri and L. mesenteroides can survive passage through the gut and adhere to the epithelial lining, which is an essential trait of effective probiotics. Once in the gut, these species exhibit antibacterial and antifungal activities. Notably, L. kefiri can bind toxic metals and mycotoxins, highlighting its potential for emergency toxicology applications. L. mesenteroides produces linoleic acid, which has antiatherogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic effects. L. lactis is often referred to as a 'cell factory' due to its demonstrated potential for delivering therapeutics and vaccines.

The proportion and presence of each bacterial species in kefir can vary significantly depending on region, substrate, and manufacturer.

AAB, including Acetobacter fabarum, Acetobacter lovaniensis, Acetobacter orientalis, Gluconobacter oxydans, and Gluconobacter liquefaciens, have also been identified in kefir. Acetic acid and its metabolites produced by these bacteria can increase ileal motility, enhance colonic blood flow, and help maintain epithelial homeostasis.

Yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces marxianus, and Kluyveromyces lactis are present in kefir. These yeasts produce ethanol and carbon dioxide, giving kefir its distinct flavor and mild effervescence. Numerous studies indicate that Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii possesses antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties, which may help support conditions like irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn's disease.

Previous studies have shown varied effects after kefir consumption. For example, some healthy adults exhibited a slight, non-significant increase in Lactococcus raffinolactis, whereas those with metabolic syndrome or IBD showed increases in Actinobacteria and Lactobacillus, respectively. In critically ill patients, kefir raised the Gut Microbiome Wellness Index despite reduced diversity. Women with PCOS experienced a significant rise in Bacilli abundance and displayed statistically significant improvement in physical function and mental health scores compared to pre-treatment.

Kefir consumption alters the abundance of LAB in the gut microbiome, which may contribute to changes in gut and systemic health outcomes. For instance, research revealed that participants with metabolic syndrome in the kefir group, even a minor increase in Lactobacillales, exhibited positive changes in fasting insulin, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and blood pressure within groups.

Kefir consumption reduced salivary Streptococcus mutans levels, an important cause of dental caries in both adults and children. However, only four studies reported the impact of kefir on the oral microbiome, particularly reductions in salivary S. mutans and Lactobacillus. However, a major limitation across all four studies was reliance on culture-based methods, which detect only certain bacteria and do not provide a full picture of the oral microbiome. None of the studies used DNA sequencing, so the broader effects of kefir on oral microbial diversity remain unknown.

Kefir consumption may affect both the gut and oral microbiomes, but the strength, consistency, and clinical relevance of these effects remain uncertain.

Variation in kefir sources, inconsistent study designs, and the lack of standardized products limit drawing firm conclusions about its specific effects and long-term benefits. Well-controlled, larger, and longer-term studies will clarify kefir's true impact on the microbiome and related health outcomes.

Climate shocks are reshaping ecosystems, creating new pathways for disease across Africa, writes Albert Ansah.

When Martin Ariku walks through what remains of his once-productive fields in Bazua, in northern Ghana's Upper East region, he does so with a mix of disbelief and resignation.

For more than two decades, he has supplied improved seeds to thousands of smallholder farmers, a role built on predictability - seasons that arrive on time, crops that mature reliably and weather conditions that, while imperfect, fall within familiar bounds.

This year, none of those assumptions held.

“I have lost more than half of our fields,” says Ariku.

When rains come too late, not at all or too intensely, harvests fail. Hunger rises. Prolonged hunger leads to malnutrition … making people more vulnerable to infectious and non-communicable diseases.”

Shauna Richards, One Health and epidemiology scientist, International Livestock Research Institute

“For maize, rice, cowpea, soybean and sorghum, I harvested as low as five 100-kilogram bags per acre compared with the usual 15.”

The year brought an unforgiving sequence of extreme events. Drought arrived early, killing young crops before they could take root. Then intense, short-lived rainstorms came, drowning what had survived.

Even the new sorghum variety introduced by the non-profit organisation SNV Ghana, designed to cope with tougher conditions, could not withstand the rapid swings.

“Just when the crop was fruiting, the rains stopped again,” Ariku says. “We recovered nothing.”

The losses extend beyond Ariku's fields. Grains that fail to fully mature cannot be used as seed, meaning the next season's production across the region is already under threat.

As well as the direct impact of extreme weather, environmental disruption is fuelling the spread of destructive pests such as Fall Armyworm, once limited by cooler temperatures.

As nights warm and rainfall patterns shift, the Fall Armyworm is surviving longer and spreading faster. Ariku describes spraying pesticide repeatedly on his crops, only to watch the pest persist.

His experience matches findings from a major survey by the agricultural research organisation CABI (the parent organisation of SciDev.Net), in which 98 per cent of farmers questioned in Ghana and Zambia said their maize crops had been infected with Fall Armyworm.

In Ghana, farmers reported losing an average of 26.6 per cent of their maize harvest, while in Zambia losses reached 35 per cent. Based on this, CABI researchers estimate that US$177 million worth of maize crops are lost each year in Ghana and US$159 million in Zambia.

Scientists warn that rising temperatures accelerate the pest's metabolism and reproduction, making its expansion across Africa increasingly likely.

Copperfield Banini, former head of the Plant Protection Regulatory Services Division at Ghana's Ministry of Food and Agriculture and technical lead on plant health and marketing at Ghana Chemicals Limited, tells SciDev.Net the science is clear: climate change is fuelling pest outbreaks.

“Our increasingly warm conditions fuel Fall Armyworm populations. As cold-blooded organisms, their metabolic and developmental rates accelerate in warm weather. They grow faster, live longer and reproduce more,” he explains.

“Cold temperatures slow them down or kill them, but as it gets warmer, their range will only expand.”

Global projections show that as temperatures continue to rise over the coming decades, the Fall Armyworm's habitat will expand across the African continent.

This surge in pest pressure is not only an agricultural problem - it is a public-health threat. When families lose food and income, diets shrink and malnutrition rises, weakening immunity and increasing vulnerability to infections.

Shauna Richards, a One Health and epidemiology scientist at the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi, says the link between climate and disease becomes clearer when we examine vectors, mosquitoes, flies, tsetse flies, and the pathogens they transmit.

“Mosquitoes flourish in damp conditions,” she tells SciDev.Net. “Regions that were once hot and dry and rarely had flooding are now experiencing higher rainfall. These new pools of stagnant water provide ideal hatching grounds for mosquitoes.”

As well as creating breeding sites, floods often mix sewage with drinking water sources, increasing the risk of outbreaks such as cholera, Richards adds.

Climate change is also altering vegetation, says Richards. “Increased rainfall in areas that once experienced little moisture is causing unusually dense vegetation growth, creating new habitats for disease-carrying insects,” she explains.

“Communities that never dealt with certain vectors now face new health threats brought about by shifting weather patterns”.

Food production is increasingly disrupted by these shifts, with unpredictable rainfall making it difficult for farmers to know when to plant.

“When rains come too late, not at all or too intensely, harvests fail,” explains Richards.

“Hunger rises. Prolonged hunger leads to malnutrition, weakening the immune system and making people more vulnerable to infectious and non-communicable diseases.”

In the Ashanti region of southern Ghana, the Krampah family is experiencing a different, but equally troubling, climate-related transformation.

It is 9 pm in Bekwai, and the heat hangs heavily in the air. Nights that once offered a cooling reprieve now feel as punishing as the day.

“The level of heat is biting,” says Eric Krampah. “Even a standing fan is unable to provide some comfort.”

The prolonged heat is more than a physical discomfort. It is shifting the behaviour and survival patterns of mosquitoes, which flourish in warm, stagnant conditions.

The Krampahs have seen malaria infections become more frequent, a trend echoed across many parts of Ghana.

Warmer night-time temperatures accelerate mosquito breeding and speed up the development of malaria parasites, increasing the likelihood of transmission.

“Because the [health] insurance is not very efficient, we have had to pay out of pocket from our dwindling income,” Krampah says of the mounting medical costs.

Testimonies from households across Ghana match scientific data from the World Meteorological Organization and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which show the correlation of a warming climate with rising malaria cases and other vector borne diseases in Ghana and the rest of Africa.

Warming nights, once an abstract metric in climate reports, have become a direct driver of disease.

Yet mosquitoes are only one part of the landscape of shifting disease threats.

Climate change is redrawing the ecological boundaries that once kept certain vectors and pathogens in check, says Richards.

“Increased rainfall in areas that once experienced little moisture is causing unusually dense vegetation growth, creating new habitats for disease-carrying insects,” she adds.

“Communities that never dealt with certain vectors now face new health threats brought about by shifting weather patterns.”

In East Africa, the mosquito species Anopheles stephensi - traditionally found in South Asia - has begun appearing in cities such as Nairobi, says Patience Kiyuka, malaria coordinator at the East Africa Consortium for Clinical Research.

“Areas that never had malaria will begin experiencing transmission,” she tells SciDev.Net.

“Mosquitoes are shifting their biting patterns,” she adds, prompting health authorities to rethink interventions such as bed-nets and insecticide spraying, primarily designed for night-time and indoors.

The spread of Anopheles stephensi threatens to introduce urban malaria transmission in places that previously had none, altering the epidemiology of the disease in ways that health systems are unprepared for, Kiyuka says

The expanding disease landscape also includes zoonotic spillovers - diseases that jump from animals to humans.

One of the clearest climate-linked examples is Rift Valley fever, a viral infection transmitted from livestock to people. In East Africa, outbreaks have repeatedly followed years of unusually heavy rainfall and flooding.

Wetter environments allow mosquito populations that transmit the virus among cattle, goats and sheep to explode, and human infections rise soon after. As rainfall patterns become more erratic, the ecological conditions that trigger such outbreaks are expected to occur more frequently, making zoonotic spillover a growing continental concern.

These patterns align with evidence emerging from the One Health Horizon Scanning research, which highlights how disruptions in plant systems, animal health and the wider environment are reshaping Africa's disease landscape.

Under this lens, the continent's changing climate is not producing isolated crises, but interconnected ones: crop losses deepen malnutrition, stressed livestock become more vulnerable to infection, and shifting ecosystems create new habitats for vectors that spill into human settlements.

Ama Essel, a public-health physician and climate negotiator for Ghana, says the impacts of climate change add pressure to already fragile health systems.

She says many clinics lack strong buildings, reliable electricity, functional cold chain systems for vaccines and even basic medical supplies.

“In Ghana, storms have ripped roofs off health facilities, leaving them unusable just when communities need them most,” she says.

“Floods cut off entire villages from the nearest clinic because poor road networks become impassable.

“Pregnant women in labour sometimes travel by motorbike or are carried on makeshift stretchers simply because there is no other way to reach help.”

These converging pressures reflect what the One Health Horizon Scanning report has been warning: that Africa's health risks can no longer be separated into human, animal or environmental categories.

Essel warns that health systems will struggle to prepare for rising disease outbreaks, emerging infections and future climate-driven pandemics.

Already, countries are seeing unusual patterns, such as increasing Mpox cases in Ghana and spikes in meningitis during the dusty, dry Harmattan season. Beyond physical illness, communities facing repeated floods, displacement and loss of livelihoods are experiencing a surge in mental-health challenges.

Essel believes African leaders must take swift action by strengthening infrastructure, investing in vaccine development and improving transport and energy systems to withstand future disease risks.

“We need sufficient funding to deal with this additional burden resulting from weather changes,” she says.

“The climate crisis is not waiting, and neither should we.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Novel diagnostic approach enables detection of antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity in Klebsiella strains","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251215/Novel-diagnostic-approach-enables-detection-of-antibiotic-resistance-and-pathogenicity-in-Klebsiella-strains.aspx","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 14:10:00 GMT","

Antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing—and quietly advancing—challenges facing modern medicine. Among the most dangerous bacterial pathogens driving this crisis is Klebsiella pneumoniae, a microorganism capable of causing severe infections while evading both antibiotics and the human immune system.

Now, a research team led by Prof. Dr. Füsun Can at Koç University School of Medicine has developed a novel diagnostic approach that enables the rapid and simultaneous detection of both antibiotic resistance and high virulence in Klebsiella pneumoniae. The research has been recognized with the 2025 Nature MDx Impact Award, highlighting its scientific originality and strong potential for real-world clinical impact.

Klebsiella pneumoniae normally exists harmlessly in the human gut and on the skin. However, in vulnerable patients—particularly those in hospital settings—it can cause life-threatening conditions such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and sepsis. In recent years, especially concerning strains have emerged that combine multidrug resistance with hypervirulence, making infections both harder to treat and more severe.

Prof. Dr. Can's team focused on precisely these strains. Their newly developed diagnostic system identifies, in a single and rapid test, the genetic markers responsible for both pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance. Until now, these features could only be assessed separately, often through time-consuming procedures that delayed effective treatment.

The ability to capture this critical information simultaneously represents a significant advance in molecular diagnostics.

Unlike viral outbreaks, bacterial resistance does not erupt suddenly—but its cumulative impact is profound. Delayed or inappropriate antibiotic treatment increases mortality risk, prolongs hospital stays, and accelerates the spread of resistant strains.

Rapid, accurate diagnosis is therefore central to effective clinical decision-making. By enabling clinicians to identify the most dangerous Klebsiella strains at an early stage, this new approach supports timely, targeted therapy and strengthens infection-control strategies in healthcare settings.

The Nature MDx Impact Award is presented to research that not only advances diagnostic science but also addresses urgent clinical needs. In its evaluation, Nature highlighted the project's originality, translational relevance, and potential for broad implementation.

The study's selection underscores the growing importance of molecular epidemiology and precision diagnostics in confronting the global antibiotic resistance crisis. The project is supported by international industry collaboration, further strengthening its pathway toward clinical application.

Beyond diagnostics, Prof. Dr. Can's research program aims to unravel how Klebsiella pneumoniae evades the immune system—a key step toward developing next-generation treatment strategies. Understanding these mechanisms could enable the design of novel therapeutic molecules, potentially supported by artificial intelligence-driven drug discovery.

As antibiotic resistance continues to challenge healthcare systems worldwide, this work offers a timely and concrete step forward—transforming molecular insight into tools that can save lives.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Two compounds sourced from cannabis show promising anti-cancer effects","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251215/Two-compounds-sourced-from-cannabis-show-promising-anti-cancer-effects.aspx","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 12:05:00 GMT","

In the future, scientists could use drugs made from cannabis to fight ovarian cancer. A team of scientists testing the effects of two chemical compounds sourced from cannabis on ovarian cancer cells have found that both show promising anti-cancer effects. While more research will be required to turn these results into drugs which can be delivered to patients, these findings are an important opportunity to develop effective new therapies for a cancer which is hard to diagnose and even harder to treat. 

""Ovarian cancer remains one of the deadliest gynecological malignancies, characterized by late diagnosis, high recurrence rates, and limited effective treatment options,"" said Dr. Siyao Tong of Khon Kaen University, lead author of the article in Frontiers in Pharmacology. ""Our goal is to find alternative drugs that can improve efficacy and potentially reduce toxicity, ultimately bringing new hope to patients facing this challenging disease.""

Of all the gynecological cancers, ovarian cancer kills most patients. Although there have been advances in treatment strategies, available drugs are not always effective and come with formidable side effects. New options are desperately needed. Since CBD (cannabidiol, which is not psychoactive) and THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, which is) have shown potential against other cancers, the research team decided to test them against ovarian cancer cells. 

They took two different lines of ovarian cancer cells, one of which is sensitive to platinum-derived drugs and one of which is resistant, and challenged the lines with CBD, THC, or both, to see if the cells could survive and reproduce after exposure. The scientists also challenged a line of healthy cells, to see if the compounds damaged them.

They found that cells for both cancer lines which had been treated with CBD or THC formed fewer and smaller colonies of cells. Though both compounds worked to prevent cancer cells reproducing, combining them gave particularly good results. And although neither compound alone killed a large proportion of cancer cells, a combination of the two was very successful. It's possible that THC and CBD act on the cancer cells in different ways, and when used together, their effects are amplified. 

Notably, the inhibitory effect was most pronounced when CBD and THC were used in a 1:1 ratio.""

Dr. Siyao Tong of Khon Kaen University

Additional assays showed that the compounds prevented cells from migrating, which means they might be able to stop ovarian cancer spreading to other parts of the body. Many patients die of metastases, so a treatment which prevents metastasis could save lives.

Both cell lines were similarly affected, suggesting that the compounds could work equally well for different types of ovarian cancer. The compounds and their combinations also had minimal effects on healthy cells, which suggests that patients might find treatments made from them less toxic and easier to tolerate than current drugs. 

To understand the mechanism behind these anti-cancer effects, the scientists looked at cell signaling pathways. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is overactivated in ovarian cancer cells, which contributes to tumor development and treatment resistance. The CBD and THC compounds seemed to restore normal regulation of the pathway, which could explain why the cancer cells couldn't reproduce and began to die off after treatment. 

But much more work remains to be done before these results can be translated into practical treatments. The scientists call for further research which can establish if and how these compounds can be used as effective new ovarian cancer therapies.

""Although our study is still preliminary, it lays an important foundation for future research into the potential applications of CBD and THC in ovarian cancer treatment,"" said Tong. ""By confirming their anti-cancer activity and identifying key molecular mechanisms, our findings are expected to drive further preclinical research. If future studies confirm these effects, CBD-THC combination therapy may ultimately contribute to the development of new treatment strategies.""

""However, this study has some limitations,"" Tong added. ""All experiments were conducted in vitro, so the results may not fully reflect the complexity of tumor behavior in living organisms. We did not include in vivo models and pharmacokinetic data, which are crucial for determining whether CBD/THC can be safely and effectively used clinically. Finally, regulatory and legal issues surrounding cannabinoid therapy may also affect future translational research. While the results are encouraging, more studies are needed before these findings can be applied to patient treatment.""

U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker's grand plan for a ""U.S. Way"" sounds at first like talking down from the top. In fact, there's a lot less of it than there used to be.

Sometimes, it feels like there's a distance between the U.S. men's and women's soccer teams, even though they wear the same crest.

Over the years, various people involved with both programs have tried to close that gap, including at U.S. Soccer headquarters. Sporting director Matt Crocker is definitely on that list, and high up on it.

That's especially true when he talks about his vision of “the U.S. Way,” the creation of an on-field guidebook for the whole governing body. Many people will instinctively conclude that Crocker is sending a sermon from the mount, given how often the governing body has tried to do that over the years.

But it isn't that simple, and it's not just Crocker saying so. The last few months of on-field results at the senior levels have offered proof.

In some countries, every national team would be required to play the same way. Think of the Netherlands and Spain, for example, two programs with decades-long histories of putting philosophy over pragmatism.

Crocker is more pragmatic. Once he hired Mauricio Pochettino to coach the senior men and Emma Hayes to coach the senior women, he wanted to get out of their way. He does not stop Pochettino from playing a 3-4-2-1 formation, and Hayes from playing a 4-3-3.

“They are arguably two of the best coaches in the world,” Crocker told The Inquirer. “Who am I, in my experience, to dictate how they should be playing or not playing? I think the idea of that, for me, is not the way I work.”

His experience gives him power if he wants to exercise it. Before joining U.S. Soccer in 2023, previous stops for the native Welshman included seven years at English soccer's governing body, the Football Association. He planted seeds that have now made the nation elite on both the men's and women's sides.

But no, what Crocker said is what he meant. 

“Of course, there's going to be a framework ... of how we want them to work,” he continued. “But ultimately their job is to provide winning teams, and I think they're doing a pretty good job at doing that. And my job is to make sure that they get what they need to be able to do that.”

If you only follow soccer casually, you might not think much of this. If you're deep in the sport, especially the American game, you know it matters to hear that from someone so high-ranking.

“The way I see it is, my job is not to dictate every single detail of how everything needs to look or feel,” Crocker said. “I need to use their experiences, because they've got more than me in those areas of what winning looks like.”

Hayes vouched for this, and not by making light of the size of her trophy mantel. She knew Pochettino before taking the U.S. job because they overlapped at English club Chelsea, and she knew American soccer from many years of working here before returning to her native London in 2012.

“Mauricio's ideas on how to win football matches might be different to mine, for example, but we both have ambition to win football matches,” Hayes said. “And we both have an appreciation that American players have their own unique set of qualities that we can lean into.”

How they execute from there is up to them.

“Yes, the U.S. Way is very clear and overarching — that sits above our WNT and MNT and all our other 27 teams,” Hayes said, using the abbreviations for the senior women's and men's teams. “But within that, some of those differences are in and around the game model.”

That might not sound like much, but it really does matter.

If there's distance between the men's and women's teams, it often feels like there's a canyon between the senior squads on TV and the youth teams your kids play on. That, too, has seemed deliberate at times, with so many factions in the sport wanting to do what they want instead of working together for the game as a whole.

America's youth soccer landscape, which better resembles an industrial complex — and really feels that big, in terms of scale — has a long history of rebelling against being told what to do by U.S. Soccer. Crocker quickly became well-versed in this when he took his job, and has spent a lot of time trying to change the tone.

“I think we have to recognize that what we do in state X can't just be replicated and put into state Y,” he said. “Everyone's unique and individual, and we have to listen to their individual needs. But we've also got to be clear on the framework of the things that are fundamental, and that we are going to do irrespective.”

He admitted that the scale of this country “scares you to death” for such a project, compared to how he built the England DNA program at the FA in 2013.

“You could bring every county FA to St. George's Park, all of which were within a three-hour drive [from the national training center],” Crocker said. “You could mandate, you could then put people out into those environments to support it, and you could do it where you could really monitor something on a much smaller scale. Doing this is something I've never experienced before.”

That literal geography, not just youth soccer politics, influenced his journey to now.

“I don't think there's one silver bullet that you need to take, or you go, ‘It's not going to work because of X,'” he said. “I just think we have to recognize the uniqueness of the country, build on that as a positive, but also remember not to make the same mistakes as others that have gone before us.”

Then came words that a lot of people — especially the youth coaches out there — have wanted to hear.

“I say this respectfully [because] I wasn't here, but what I heard was U.S. Soccer was telling: We told, we told, we told,” Crocker said. “And now our job is to listen, to work, to problem solve, but to bring everyone together.”

Anecdotally, it's been working. At various events this year where Crocker has spoken to youth and amateur teams, he has been warmly received. But the hardest part is yet to come, as a recent moment showed.

» READ MORE: Philly fans are ready for the ‘once in a lifetime experience' of hosting a World Cup in their hometown

Earlier this month, Crocker spoke to a crowd of the governing body's sponsors and donors. Some of them wore track jackets of their youth clubs, but most were in business clothes. Crocker shared the stage with deputy sporting director and onetime Union centerback Oguchi Onyewu and U.S. men's legend Landon Donovan.

“For those who are not familiar with the youth soccer landscape in this country, it's a bit of a disaster, right?” Donovan said. “It really is. There's so many competing interests.”

He spoke of a local club near his home in southern California, but knew it could have been countless others.

“People are very content with their little fiefdom and their little salary and their club and their control and their power,” Donovan said. “So what's the incentive now for these clubs to change? … We do have national pride, but they're more worried about their bottom line than they are [about] growing U.S. soccer.”

The words were as true as they were damning.

“I think the saying is, do what you've always done and you'll get what you've always got,” Crocker said. “There's been a lot of talk about, there's a player that plays in this league over here that has to drive or fly thousands of miles because this league is falling out with this league, and they won't play each other. And that's not putting the child, that's not putting the sport, at the heart of what we're all about.”

It's true for the boys and men, and it's true for the girls and women. It's an enormous task, but Crocker is willing to give from his side, and that is noticed.

“I think it's being respectful to environments that have already been created,” he said. “Us as U.S. Soccer, being the national federation, the people that should be really saying, ‘Hey this is what player development and the game could look like in this country' — it's about time we spoke up and started to share some of that. But it's not through a dictator approach, it's through more of a collaborative way of doing things.” 

Crocker's plans are due to be published in January, the same month Philadelphia will host the 2026 United Soccer Coaches convention. It won't be easy for him to get that crowd on his side, for the reasons Donovan made clear. If Crocker can, though, the benefits could last long past the World Cup.

Jenna Nighswonger may no longer be in the plans at Arsenal. But before she finds her next spot, she needs to solidify her position. 

by



Jenna Nighswonger is at a critical juncture in her career. Entering 2025, she appeared near the top of the list of left-backs competing for a starting role with the U.S. women's national team. Since moving to Arsenal last January, however, she has fallen down the pecking order at an alarming rate. The 25-year-old hasn't been called up since the SheBelieves Cup in February, while players like Lilly Reale, Kate Wiesner and Izzy Rodriguez have since forced their way into contention.





Next year will be a big one for Nighswonger. Recently, Tim Stillman of the Arseblog Arsenal Women Newsletter reported that she will likely exit the club, either on loan or permanently, in the upcoming January transfer window. Her next move shouldn't be based solely on playing time, but also on the position she will play.

Pulisic celebrates with Milan, Reyna in action for Borussia Monchengladbach Image Photo Agency/Getty Images and Christian Verheyen/Borussia Monchengladbach via Getty Images

It was more minutes and momentum for Gio Reyna in Germany, a triumphant return for Antonee Robinson and an opportunity missed for Christian Pulisic and Milan at the San Siro.

Here's how Europe's USMNT stars fared at the weekend…

Finally, after months of uncertainty at his new club, this is what Gio Reyna needed.

Advertisement

The 23-year-old forward and his Borussia Monchengladbach team lost 3-1 against Wolfsburg on Saturday, but the game proved a personal milestone for the American.

It marked Reyna's third consecutive start for the team he joined in the summer — the first time the United States international has been in three successive starting XIs at club level since August 2021.

Injuries, fitness and subsequent fitful form had reduced him to the periphery at his previous side, Borussia Dortmund, endangering the international spot of a player considered a natural and game-changing talent.

A loan to Nottingham Forest in the Premier League did not work either, so the decision to join Gladbach was a chance for a reset in a league he had at least become familiar with.

But until recently, his only start for the club had come in September's 4-0 home defeat against Werder Bremen.

To compound matters, Gladbach's rocky performances led to the sacking of Gerardo Seoane, the head coach who was involved in signing Reyna. Cue more uncertainty for the American in a season when he needed to be getting more game time than the 341 minutes he managed in the Bundesliga last season.

National team coach Mauricio Pochettino is an admirer, but it became harder to select a player who was playing so little.

It seems like something has changed. The club appointed former reserve-team boss Eugen Polanski as interim coach, and made his appointment permanent in November.

It has been a positive development for Reyna, as the 39-year-old clearly values him.

Speaking before Saturday's game, Polanski told the Bundesliga website: “We wanted to gradually integrate him and generate more playing time.

“For that to happen, it was crucial that Gio embraced it the way he did. I have rarely seen a training session from him that I wasn't satisfied with, and I have recently seen values ​​I hadn't seen before.”

Although Reyna must compete with midfielder Florian Neuhaus for the starting spot, the German's injury problems have led to opportunities, which have been taken.

“We can almost replace Neuhaus like-for-like,” Polanski explained. “Reyna perhaps has a slightly more attacking profile, is a bit better in the space between the lines, and isn't the same clear playmaker as Flo. He's made extremely good runs and improved from game to game. I'm extremely happy.”

Reyna has been involved in some of the team's better periods of play over the last three games.

A direct assist or goal is yet to arrive, but he reminded everyone that he has that threat in his locker against Paraguay and Uruguay last month, when he registered one of each.

Another key USMNT player back in the fold at the weekend was Antonee Robinson.

As reported by The Athletic, the left-back recently made significant progress in his efforts to recover from the knee injury that was starting to make him fear he might miss the World Cup.

Initially, there was hope he would be fit to make his belated return in time for Fulham's Carabao Cup quarter-final against Newcastle United on Wednesday.

But such was the relief of pain and increased strength after working with a specialist in the north west, former Liverpool head physio Andy Renshaw, that he trained well throughout last week.

In the end, head coach Marco Silva decided the 28-year-old was ready to go. He started Saturday's 3-2 win over Burnley at Turf Moor and played the full game.

“Jedi (Robinson) had a good week,” Silva told Fulham's website after the game. “After two or three months without a game, it's never easy, but we knew that from a physical point of view he'd be ready and he showed that.

“I didn't take the decision to change him and let him play the full 96 minutes because he's a great athlete, we know that. All the other things will come with time.”

In Milan, Christian Pulisic did not quite reach the levels he has been hitting lately.

It was a frustrating afternoon for Milan, who only drew 2-2 with Sassuolo at the San Siro. The result saw them drop to second place behind rivals Inter, who beat Genoa 2-1.

The solitary point meant Milan eventually dropped off the top of the table and into second place, as rivals Inter beat Genoa on Sunday to go top of Serie A.

Extra frustration for Pulisic came from a ruled-out ‘goal' — he was in the right place to convert from close range on 57 minutes but Ruben Loftus-Cheek was adjudged to have fouled a defender.

Afterwards, Massimiliano Allegri explained why he took the American off after 73 minutes, even with his side chasing a win — and in the process, the Milan head coach highlighted how Pulisic scored his double against Torino when he was unwell.

“I would have done it anyway,” Allegri told DAZN. “Christian had joined us in Turin after a fever and then trained.

”He played well for 72 minutes, but at that moment, we needed one more midfielder.”

Other young USMNT players maintained good levels, too.

Teenage centre-back Noahkai Banks played the full 90 minutes of Augsburg's 1-0 defeat against Eintracht Frankfurt.

Banks performed strongly and had a ‘goal' disallowed. It was his ninth consecutive start in the Bundesliga — not bad for a 19-year-old defender in one of Europe's top divisions.

Also in Germany, Malik Tillman impressed for Bayer Leverkusen in their 2-0 win against Koln, and James Sands played the full game for St Pauli as they beat Heidenheim 2-1.

In the Netherlands, Ricardo Pepi made it three goals in his last three Eredivisie matches for defending champions PSV. Compatriot Sergino Dest shone too, setting up the game's winner with a sublime first touch and run that gave Guus Til a goal to make it 4-3 against Heracles Almelo. It was one for the ever-expanding Dest showreel.

In the Premier League, there was a rare setback for Chris Richards and Crystal Palace, who lost 3-0 at Selhurst Park to an Erling Haaland-inspired Manchester City.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Road to World Cup 2026: USMNT's Five Best Players of the Week—Ranked","https://www.si.com/soccer/road-to-world-cup-2026-usmnt-five-best-players-of-the-week-ranked-december-8-14","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

The 2026 World Cup is now less than six months away for the U.S. men's national team, who will get their tournament underway in Los Angeles, California.

While they know they will face Australia, Paraguay, and one of Slovakia, Kosovo, Türkiye or Romania in the group stage, the roster is still very much in flux, especially as Mauricio Pochettino sees stellar form from some hopeful World Cup talents in Europe. 

Unlike past years, the USMNT won't have a January camp to see some players in person, meaning their next games come in the March window, where they will hope to fine-tune what the final roster could look like. 

Here, Sports Illustrated ranks the top five performances of the week from around the globe.

Likely the leading choice to start the USMNT's first World Cup match, Folarin Balogun continued his strong form this season in Ligue 1 and the Champions League.The 24-year-old scored the winning goal in Monaco's 1–0 win over Galatasaray—his seventh goal of the campaign and third in Europe—and then saw an effort ruled out for offside during the weekend defeat to Tim Weah's Marseille.Though that game didn't go the way Balogun wanted it to, he put in a decent shift up front for Monaco, completing four dribbles and taking three shots on goal.

Malik Tillman continues to settle in at Bayer Leverkusen after his blockbuster signing in the summer and helped the club to a 2–0 Rhine Derby win over rivals FC Köln.The dynamic attacking midfielder had two shots and created two chances while playing alongside Jonas Hoffman and also stepped up with five defensive contributions. Playing in a 3-5-1-1 formation for Leverkusen, he has shown his ability to work the ball centrally but also engage in overlapping runs from the wingbacks, a factor which could be valuable to Pochettino after his switch to using a back three.

One more week of the season in the books and it's another week where Ricardo Pepi found himself on the scoresheet. The 22-year-old American scored in UEFA Champions League action against Atlético Madrid midweek, then scored a perfectly placed penalty kick against Heracles Almelo in Eredivisie action on the weekend.Pepi has now scored in four-straight matches across all competitions, becoming the first American to do so for an Eredivisie club since Aron Jóhannsson for AZ in 2013-14.The former FC Dallas starlet has nine goals in all competitions this season and will look to close out 2025 in strong form, setting the stage for the 2026 World Cup year.

Weston McKennie continued to impress with Juventus this season, scoring a goal in a 2–0 midweek Champions League win against Pafos, before playing 90 minutes in the 1–0 Serie A victory over Bologna. Although he has yet to find the back of the net in Serie A action and was unable to make the most of extra space after Bologna's red card on Sunday, he has shown an ability to be clinical in the biggest matches on European soccer's biggest stage.At the same time, his growth as a balanced wide midfielder is commendable, and the 27-year-old looks more comfortable as Juventus continues to grow under midseason managerial appointment, Luciano Spalletti. 

Antonee Robinson impressed in his first Premier League start of the season with Fulham on Saturday, returning to the lineup after undergoing knee surgery prior to the 2025–26 campaign.Robinson, 28, played the full 90 minutes in a 3–2 win over Burnley, moving his side up to 13th in the Premier League and boosting his stock with the USMNT as Pochettino seeks options for a three and five-man backline.He was significantly productive in the match as well, completing eight passes into the final third, while posting six recoveries, four tackles and two interceptions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","When will Chelsea finally start operating like an elite football club?","https://siphillipstalkschelsea.substack.com/p/when-will-chelsea-finally-start-operating","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 10:59:41 GMT","

I had another article written today but I've ditched that one. Because of the things I've heard in the last 48 hours, from various reliable people including our own Simon, that all changed. And honestly I feel more disheartened about Chelsea's future than I have for some time.

Head Coach Enzo Maresca's comments about the worst 48 hours of his Chelsea career, and the subsequent reports from Simon, Ben Jacobs and others, have made clear there's some major issues at the top of Chelsea FC. There's disagreements and fallouts between Maresca and the heirarchy and they seem to be getting worse. 

The response of the club was to dismiss them as an emotional overreaction, reiterate their commitment to their strategy, and also things which I took as a brief against Maresca. 

I read a brief saying they'd recommended a rotation policy to Maresca which he supported and enacted. But when it didn't work, suddenly they put all the blame onto him for the rotations….ones THEY recommended. 

Maresca feels hung out to dry and scapegoated, and rightly so. The clubs rotation policy, they share the blame, simple as that. Maresca publicly took responsibility for Leeds, rightly so. But he expects those above him to take responsibility for their mistakes and not make him the sole scapegoat for it. We've seen this before with the current Sporting Directors, so its no surprise. 

They had also briefed, separately,  last Thursday, that Maresca will be pressured to make the most of what he has for the rest of the season. Basically shutting down any requests for January signings (which we need, but who cares, its not like we're trying to be successful, eh?). 

Not to mention there was a briefing saying “Maresca is expected to address these comments in his press conference on Monday”. Which to me suggests he's being pressured to toe the club line and say he was being emotional. 

By the time you read this, you'll know whether he did or not. But either way, its clear things are very tense at the top.

Now first, lets be clear. I believe in the clubs overall long term strategy. We've signed some excellent players, built a top 4 squad which can win cups and appointed an excellent manager in Enzo Maresca. Fair play to the owners and Sporting Directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley for that, credit where its due. That's good work.

But I'm just done with the at times shoddy man management and abysmal treatment of certain players and staff by the Sporting Directors, and their overall conduct. 

It seems they like claiming credit for anything good, and taking no responsibility for their failures. They have now fallen out with and failed to adequately back multiple head coaches, all whilst keeping their jobs and getting longer contracts. Not to mention very publicly trying to force talented, respected players out of the club multiple times, sometimes succeeding, sometimes not. Then there's the constant insults to fans' intelligence with their ridiculous briefings which everyone knows are complete bullshit and media spin. They've broken trust with fans, most of who don't trust them anymore and never will. 

Finally of course there's their complete and utter inability to build a squad capable of competing for Premier League titles, which is or should be the ultimate goal. Because if they think adding more raw, unproven young talent with no PL experience next summer to a squad which already has tons of raw players, is going create a title challenge next year, they're kidding themselves. 

The two people running the football side, have yet to show they have a clue how to do that. Neither have ever worked at a big club before, never been in an elite performance environment in their life. Because of that, we don't have one at Chelsea yet.

They DO deserve credit for getting us back to being a steady top 4 squad who can win knockout competitions. That's where we are right now. They can spot and sign young talent well. Fair enough. I'm always happy to give credit where its due, this isn't an agenda driven post and I won't make personal attacks, this is a professional critique.

I don't believe they have what it takes to help Chelsea take the next step, and quite frankly I don't like the way they conduct their jobs and treat players and staff who are not wanted, as I mentioned above.

They are not the best in class. Best in class prove it before they join Chelsea. 

We're not a work experience program for aspiring sporting directors who'd never won a thing before they came here and worked only at smaller clubs. We're Chelsea, we hire the proven best. Simple as.

Even now, when so many can see it, even pundits, they won't accept or acknowledge they've made mistakes or shoulder responsibility.  

Enzo Maresca has won two trophies, got top four, beaten several of the top teams and top managers in Europe, and got us 4th in the PL this year, third highest scorers, third best defence, without Levi Colwill, Cole Palmer or a 9 most of the season, and with a litany of injuries leaving us to overplay Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez, combined with fatigue from the Club World Cup and a short pre season. He also wasn't given the CB we clearly needed and he asked for. 

Yet they want us to blame HIM for all the problems at the club and with the team? Give me a break. Maresca HAS made mistakes and bad decisions, but I'd be surprised if any coach could do much better this year given the circumstances - some circumstances directly caused by the Sporting Directors.

It's become clear the club heirarchy don't care at all or listen to what fans think, they don't even respect us or our views, or listen to us. The Sporting Directors time at Chelsea is littered with stories of appalling treatment of fans, players and managers, and multiple examples of abysmal man management. 

If they did their jobs, and they treated people as human beings, with honesty and dignity, admitted their mistakes and corrected them, they'd have my respect, and I'd happily apologise to them. It takes a better man to admit he was wrong and learn from it, than one who passes the buck to someone, and damages the club in the process

My dream for Chelsea is becoming consistent PL challengers and winners again, and a dominant side in Europe. With the money spent, that's where we should be heading. If we'd signed the right players in the last two summers, we might be closer than we are. 

The number of awful signings in the last 18 months beggars belief. We have wasted so much money that probably would have made us contenders now, and we could still have kept within our strategy of signing under 25s too. That's what's so annoying, is the strategy from the club CAN work, but they've handled it awfully. 

I've always been patient. I felt 2026/2027 - four years after the takeover, season 3 of Enzo Maresca, was the season we should be making a serious challenge for the title. Not winning it maybe, but in the race till April or so, finishing 2nd ideally, or 3rd, single digit points off the top.

If we're not in a position to challenge next season, the people who've overseen this rebuild and recruited two managers so far to oversee it are the ones solely to blame. A head coach can only work with the tools he's been given. They have little influence over recruitment. 

That's why Maresca is so frustrated, because the potential is there in this squad, but there's some gaping holes which remain unaddressed, and which will remain so at least till the summer, and then they'll sign more raw talent which will mean whoever is head coach will have to develop them, rather than go for a title. Signing raw talent is bad, but bringing new raw talent into the squad for more proven players every year will keep you stagnating, not win Premier Leagues. You need a balance - some elite raw talents, and other under 25 players more established and proven who can “plug in and play”, like Joao Pedro, Pedro Neto and others.

In almost any high performance organisation, an employee cannot remain in post if they have had time, money, authority to make big decisions and not delivered. It's as simple as that. And with the target of dominating Europe and the PL, if we don't start delivering soon, then things need to change right at the top.

Even the most patient and understanding fans will eventually lose patience and become frustrated, and turn on the owners and sporting directors. The media are already noticing it, thanks in part to Maresca's statement, as well as their own feelings on our recruitment, so eventually, there'll be nowhere to hide.

Sadly I'm now resigned to the prospect that Enzo Maresca will probably go by the summer, either by his own volition or “mutual consent” (sacked), and if it's the latter, no doubt the PR spin will lump all the blame on him. 

I won't buy it, but some will. And it will a complete shambles however it happens.

There's no good, football based reason for Enzo Maresca to leave Chelsea, not backing him, hanging him out to dry and letting him go is absolute madness and unless we hire someone of the calibre of Thomas Tuchel, Xabi Alonso or Oliver Glasner, could set the club back a year or two. 

If the SD's stay in post with the next manager, I'd bet good money we'll be here again a couple of years with the same issues, and it will be the same people to blame, undoubtedly. Then they'll try to scapegoat someone that manager, without a doubt. Anything to avoid showing some actual cajones and genuinely taking responsibility for their actions.

The day they are shifted to other roles and Dave Fallows takes their job, I will feel some hope of being a major force again. Because the groundwork is there, the structure is there. It just needs the final step, and that needs to be led by someone who's done it before and knows what it takes. Dave Fallows is that. He's been at Liverpool. He's built a squad which won the Champions League and Premier League. He uses data properly. He's proven he's a winner, and a best in class operator, and that's what Chelsea need in charge now.

THAT'S how serious, elite football clubs operate. 

The Score

Well said. Bravo.

Why do we have 2 SD's ? Is it one for Todd, and one for the other guy ?

Manchester United's Mason Mount has made 13 appearances and scored three goals so far this season

""I have to tell you, I love that kid.""

Ruben Amorim's first public observations on Mason Mount after his appointment as Manchester United head coach just over a year ago have stood the test of time.

It has taken longer than hoped for United's fanbase to come to the same conclusion, but Mount's goal and overall performance at Wolves last week had them purring.

Suddenly, the hole left by the impending departure of Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo to the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) doesn't look quite so difficult to fill.

Mount's game intelligence plus his awareness and ability to play in tight spaces are coming to the fore. Now the phrase most used about him is: ""His quality was never in doubt.""

Almost two and a half years into the five-year contract he signed in July 2023, Mount's own bold declarations about the future have some meaning.

""I am hugely ambitious,"" he said on his arrival at Old Trafford. ""I know how amazing it feels to win major trophies and what it takes to do it.

""I will be giving everything to experience that again at Manchester United.""

It is fair to say the statement of intent Mount made after completing his £55m move from Chelsea is yet to be fulfilled.

Match-winner Mount's quality 'never in doubt'

Amorim hails Mount after win at Wolves

A Champions League and Club World Cup winner with Chelsea, Mount was an injury-time substitute for United's 2024 FA Cup final victory over Manchester City. He started the Europa League final defeat by Tottenham in May and was part of the United squad that finished 15th.

Not that the 26-year-old regrets leaving boyhood club Chelsea.

Speak privately to people who know Mount well and you get the impression restoring United's fortunes offered the kind of challenge that enthused him.

Under Erik ten Hag at the time, the club made it clear they wanted him. That matters. It still does. That is why Amorim's first words were perfectly put.

As the former Sporting coach assessed the squad he was inheriting, he knew in Mount he was getting a high-level, flexible player who could fit into a variety of different positions within his system, something Amorim felt he did not have enough of.

Left, right, as an orthodox number 10, as a six, or an eight, Mount has a range of experiences that make him very useful for a coach who regards adaptability as a key weapon.

""He's a very smart player,"" was Amorim's response when asked about Mount on Friday before Monday's Premier League game with Bournemouth. ""He's really technical.

""Sometimes being a technical player is not just having fun with the ball. It's the quality of the pass, the reception, how to receive the ball. Mason can balance our team quite well.""

Amorim is not alone at United's Carrington training ground in recognising Mount's qualities. He is certainly not the only one genuinely glad a player who can offer so much is able to put injury issues to one side and deliver performances on a consistent basis.

No-one would argue the past couple of years have been easy. Mount himself has admitted dealing with two extended absences and a couple of smaller frustrating ones was tough.

But staff around Carrington admired the professional attitude Mount adopted throughout his various recoveries.

Training-ground sources have said the player left no stone unturned in pursuit of staying fit and was regularly one of the last to leave after long stints in the ice bath and sauna sessions.

He is regarded as a link within Amorim's squad - someone who knits groups of players together - which has been particularly evident this season when, it is generally acknowledged, United's players have remained tight and focused on delivering better results.

Mount is also well liked by non-football staff because he is helpful, which is not something that can be taken for granted in the playing department at United or any other club. He spends time with a couple of kids who are regulars outside the training ground, has spoken with them and their parents and still wears a bracelet one of them gave him.

These traits are all positives on a human scale.

However, in the pressurised world of the Premier League, they are side issues compared to delivering on the pitch - and just now, he is on a roll.

Outstanding in the win at Crystal Palace on 30 November, Mount followed up with an excellent performance against Wolves, who were admittedly poor at Molineux but proved they can be obdurate and diligent in their unlucky loss at Arsenal.

Goals in both victories have taken his overall tally for United to seven, to match his shirt number, a fact not lost on the club's content creators who put them all on the app and launched a vote for which was the best. His second in the Europa League semi-final against Athletic Bilbao - a two-touch, 50-yard effort to seal a 4-1 win - came out on top.

The idea over the next few weeks and months is to widen that particular area of debate as United push for a European place - their overall aim - and try to secure a top-five berth likely to deliver a return to the Champions League a year before schedule.

Will Mount be reunited with Tuchel at international level?

Mount won the most recent of his 36 England caps in the 2022 World Cup quarter-final defeat by France in Qatar.

Despite three years without an international appearance, Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel has not forgotten him.

Mount revealed in the summer his former manager at Chelsea had been in touch. The pair were spotted chatting after last month's home defeat by Everton and while competition for World Cup places is fierce and Mount is rated as unlikely to break in at this stage, it cannot entirely be discounted.

The player himself is not setting that as a target. Sources say his focus and drive remains on delivering on those first words following his arrival from Chelsea.

Mount recognises turning the United tanker around has to be a collective effort but there are signs it is heading in the right direction, even if the process is lengthy and not without the odd glitch.

He clearly has a significant role though. Mount has missed one game so far this season though injury. His impact is starting to be felt.

Just as United prepare to lose two significant attacking forces to Afcon, they can look for Mount to deliver in their absence with an increased feeling of confidence.

Scotland boss Steve Clarke urged fans not to put themselves into debt to secure World Cup tickets next summer; tickets cost between £134 to £525 for group stage games; the Association of Tartan Army Clubs (ATAC) branded the costs ""disgraceful and disgusting""

Scotland boss Steve Clarke has warned fans against taking on financial debt to travel and support the team at next summer's World Cup.

The national boss described the country as gripped by ""World Cup fever"" since qualifying for the finals for the first time in 28 years with an unforgettable 4-2 win over Denmark at Hampden Park in November.

Scotland have been drawn against Brazil, Morocco and Haiti in Group C, with tickets costing between £134 to £524. The Association of Tartan Army Clubs (ATAC) branded the costs ""disgraceful and disgusting"".

Speaking on the day that supporter club members can apply for tickets against Haiti and Morocco in Boston, as well as the fixture against Brazil in Miami, Clarke pleaded with the fanbase to not exceed their financial capabilities to attend the tournament.

Fans who do not receive any through the Scotland Supporters Club will have to deal with FIFA's dynamic pricing model and resale costs.

""We can't control the prices,"" Clarke told Sky Sports News. ""Listen, it's expensive to go to America anyway.

""If you can afford to go, then great. But if you can't afford to go, then understand it. Don't put yourself and your family into debt.

""The tickets are set. The ticket prices are set with FIFA. My biggest wish is that people don't put themselves into too much debt trying to get there.

""Even if you're going on holiday to America, you need to save up and you need to save up and you need to save up to get across the Atlantic and have your holiday there. So it's always going to be an expensive World Cup.

""I think that's a big thing for me. I'd like to think that with the smaller allocation that we've got, that a lot of the fans will travel everywhere. I'm talking about going to the far-flung places, but maybe only 1,200 people will turn up.

""I'd like to think that all those fans have got the chance to have a ticket to get to some of the matches.

""I've known some of them, not very well, but I've known them and have seen them around the place. I'm quite sure they'll find some great ways to do that.""

Football Supporters Europe (FSE) stated that rather than adopting a standard price across all group matches, pricing appeared to have been calculated ""dependent on vague criteria such as the perceived attractiveness of the fixture"".

Dynamic pricing will be used in some phases of World Cup ticket sales. However, the governing body has confirmed that it will not apply during the main ballot. The price you see at the start of the window will be the same at the end.

The official 2026 World Cup bid said the cheapest tickets all the way through the tournament would range from $21 (£15) to $128 (£96).

Tickets for the Euro 2024 final between England and Spain in Berlin were available from £83.

FIFA is refusing to comment after releasing the World Cup ticket prices although it did say that there had been five million ticket requests in 24 hours, which ""underlines soaring global demand"".

FIFA's position on ticket prices has always been that it is a non-profit organisation and any money it makes from ticket sales is reinvested in football.

Meanwhile, the Scottish Football Supporters Association (SFSA) have written to SFA CEO Ian Maxwell, regarding ticket pricing after revealing they have been inundated with correspondence from members.

Whilst recognising the SFA's limited direct influence over FIFA's pricing strategy, the SFSA say the national association should ""formally and robustly convey to FIFA the depth of anger and alienation this has caused"".

They added that ""the current pricing and allocation framework is not merely unpopular; it is fundamentally misjudged"".

Craig Burley and Frank Leboeuf look at Group C, with Brazil, Morocco, Haiti and Burley's Scotland looking to qualify. (1:23)

Steve Clarke has urged the Tartan Army not to push the financial boat out too far to see Scotland at the World Cup next summer.

The national boss described the country as gripped by ""World Cup fever"" since qualifying for the finals for the first time in 28 years with an unforgettable 4-2 win over Denmark at Hampden Park in November.

Scotland will play Haiti and Morocco in Boston and Brazil in Miami but there has been uproar at some of the ticket prices which range from £134 to £524.

Fans who do not receive any through the Scotland Supporters Club will have to deal with FIFA's dynamic pricing model and resale costs and the Association of Tartan Army Clubs (ATAC) branded the costs ""disgraceful and disgusting"".

""Tickets are going to be tight,"" said Clarke, who will not rule out the recruitment of Newcastle attacker Harvey Barnes.

""The Scottish FA have taken the full allocation of eight per cent of capacity. I'm sure it'll be used.

""My biggest wish is that the fans who travel everywhere, who go all the far-flung places, can afford to get the tickets and get the chance to get the tickets so they can be there because those supporters deserve to be there.

""Some of the figures are eye-watering, if you look at them.

""One of my biggest wishes is that people don't put themselves too much into debt trying to buy tickets. Even the cheapest ones look to be pretty pricey.

""But listen, it's a World Cup, FIFA will tell you they've had five million applications for two million tickets, which shows you the will is there, people want to be there.

""If you go on holiday to America, it's expensive. It's going to be expensive, just make sure people don't put themselves into too much debt. That's one thing I would say.""

Barnes, born in Burnley, has been capped once for England when he featured in a friendly against Wales in 2020 but remains eligible to represent Scotland through his maternal grandparents.

After Scotland's historic win over Denmark, the 28-year-old Newcastle player was asked by Sky Sports if the door had closed on potentially playing for Scotland and said: ""No, of course it's not. I've obviously played for England, I know the eligibility side is still there.""

Clarke said: ""Well, if he's kept the door open, then the door's open, so let's see what happens.

""It's just one of those things that it's probably too difficult to talk about because you don't know what's going to happen.

""Maybe Harvey thinks he's going to get picked for England. He's in a really good vein of form at the moment so let's see what happens.

""Obviously, people know I'm quite loyal to the players in the squad, that's what we've built.

""We've tried to build that across the years, but there are always spaces.

""The squad size will be 26, which always gives at least three extra spaces to the normal 23-man squad.

""There's always injuries and loss of form to take into account.""

Scotland will confirm in January where they will be based in the USA while a game against Japan could be one of the friendly matches to be arranged for March.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Update: A few days ago, Footy Headlines reported that FIFA had ordered Uruguay to remove two stars from their crest for the 2026 World Cup. We must clarify that this information was incorrect.

We have since verified that the issue was definitively resolved years ago. Uruguay will retain their four stars for the 2026 World Cup, consistent with a ruling FIFA made back in 2022.

The rumor regarding the removal of the stars stems from a real controversy that occurred in 2021. At that time, FIFA - through an email sent to kit supplier Puma, unofficially requested that the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) remove two stars, arguing that only the 1930 and 1950 World Cup titles should count.

However, the AUF launched a rigorous defense, utilizing historical documents to prove the validity of their four world titles.

Following the scandal, FIFA officially backed down. In May 2022, FIFA confirmed that Uruguay is permitted to display four stars on their jersey for the 2022 World Cup and all subsequent tournaments.

This decision was a victory for Uruguayan historians, who successfully argued that the 1924 (Paris) and 1928 (Amsterdam) Olympic football tournaments were ""FIFA Open World Championships"" organized by FIFA before the World Cup existed.

Therefore, despite the recent rumors circulating online, fans can expect the Nike Uruguay 2026 World Cup kits to proudly feature the traditional four stars above the crest.

We apologize for the confusion caused by our previous report.

Vice-president of German parliament slams ‘disgusting' ceremony in which Donald Trump received peace prize, and calls ticket prices ‘insane'

A vice-president of Germany's parliament has hit out at Fifa over a “disgusting” World Cup draw ceremony where US President Donald Trump played a big role and “completely insane” ticket prices for the tournament.

Omid Nouripour from the Green Party, one of the vice-presidents of the lower house Bundestag, said on Sunday that “Fifa is not doing itself a favour in the long run. The neutrality is broken in quite a bad way.”

Trump was honoured with a new Fifa peace prize at the December 5 draw in Washington for the 2026 tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Fifa countered criticism on the closeness of its president Gianni Infantino to Trump by saying that such “good relationships” to top politicians of host countries were essential to guarantee a successful event.

Nouripour called the ceremony “disgusting” and also joined the criticism on the ticket prices for fans by saying the costs are “completely insane”.

Listing the prices for fans of its match contingents, the German FA said that the cheapest group stage ticket would cost €155 (US$180) and that a fan interested in attending every Germany match including the final – if the team makes it – would have to splash out at least €5,975.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}","soccer"

Isolina de la Vega was hooked on soccer from the first time she saw a match. Where she grew up in Tucumán, a province in northern Argentina, not many girls followed the sport. But de la Vega's great grandfather was the president of a local soccer club, and her father was a big fan, too. So she was curious.

“One day I say (to) my father, ‘Okay, I want to go and see one match, and if I like, you pay the ticket for me for all time,'” de la Vega said.

He agreed – and she loved it. The way that families and friends come together to enjoy the match is special, she says, and the rivalries between teams are unmatched.

De la Vega moved to Kansas City with her husband, Dario, three and a half years ago and opened Los Hornos Argentinian Flavors in the Northland. She doesn't see as many matches these days, but she's still a passionate soccer fan — especially of reigning World Cup champion Argentina.

When Argentinian soccer superstar Lionel Messi visited Kansas City for a match between Inter Miami, his Major League Soccer team, and Sporting KC, she tracked down Inter Miami's chef and delivered empanadas to give to Messi. Messi gifted her a signed jersey and flag in return.

De la Vega attended the FIFA Final Draw watch party at Power and Light when organizers announced Argentina would play a group-stage match in Kansas City.

“We are super excited and waiting for the World Cup,” she said.

Argentina and six other nations will play matches in Kansas City during the World Cup next year. Curaçao, Algeria, Tunisia, Austria, Ecuador and the Netherlands round out the list. Across Kansas City, residents are thrilled to welcome their teams to their adopted city – and excited to see them play.

Orlando Cachiguango already had a World Cup game on his bucket list, and when FIFA announced the United States would co-host with Mexico and Canada, he knew he had to try to go.

That feeling has only compounded since he found out Ecuador will play a match against Curaçao in Kansas City during the first round of the tournament. Cachiguango was born in Ecuador and lived there until he moved to the Midwest in the early 2000s.

“Even if Ecuador played in another city I was planning to see, you know, it's once in a lifetime, ” he said.

The announcement at the FIFA Final Draw Dec. 5 and 6 was a welcome surprise. Cachiguango immediately started hearing from friends in Ecuador who plan to come to town for the match.

“I feel happy. I feel proud,” he said. “It's something that every soccer fan would like to have, you know? The chance to be your city, your team, World Cup.”

Cachiguango hasn't secured his seats to the game yet. But fans can apply for tickets in FIFA's Random Selection Draw, which runs until Jan. 13. Prices currently range from a minimum of $140 for the match between Algeria and Austria to as high as $1,265 for Kansas City's quarterfinal match.

Kansas City expects to welcome at least 650,000 visitors during its month of hosting matches. For those with ties to Kansas City and the countries that will play, it's an opportunity to share their culture with Kansas City, and Kansas City with their home countries.

In Algeria, “they go crazy about soccer,” said Brahim Malem, an Algerian-American who lives in Olathe. “It's kind of like football here in Kansas… how people follow the Chiefs here, I would say it's the same, or a little bit more.”

Algeria will play two matches at Arrowhead Stadium during the group stage, and Malem is confident his home country will pick Kansas City as a base camp. He applied to volunteer with the local World Cup organizing committee, KC2026, in hopes of taking part in the festivities.

Patrick Bakker, a Dutch citizen who has lived in Overland Park since 2002, says he's excited to share game-day traditions with Americans. An “orange legion” of Dutch fans traditionally march to the stadium together, all wearing the iconic color of the national team.

“The whole crowd is following a bus towards a stadium and there's a loudspeaker on the back, and someone is cheering up the crowd. And we go in the thousands. Yeah, it's incredible,” Bakker said. “We know how to organize a party.”

Claudia Luna West, who owns Buenos Aires Restaurant in Shawnee, hopes more Kansas Citians will appreciate Argentine culture with the national team coming to play.

“We have so much to share. It's so rich, the cultural impact from Argentina,” West said. “If someone visits my restaurant they can see it.”

West also wants to capitalize on the opportunity. She plans to sell her empanadas wholesale to bars and restaurants around town for the World Cup, in addition to selling them at her restaurant. And she plans to serve as a tour guide for visiting Argentinians. She's already heard from one group asking for places to go when they visit.

Curaçao, an island nation in the Caribbean, is the smallest participating country in next year's World Cup. It qualified for the first time ever this year, in a 0-0 draw against Jamaica.

Sonya Kieffer, a Curaçao resident who grew up in Kansas City, says the country is full of national pride right now. Thousands lined the streets to welcome the national team home after their qualifying win.

“They're proud to finally be recognized. A lot of people, they don't even know how to pronounce Curaçao,” Kieffer said. “I don't know if you caught when they were drawing the names, and (Wayne Gretzky) said it wrong. He said ‘kur-AH-koh'” (it's actually pronounced CURE-uh-soww).

Kieffer won't make it home to Kansas City for the June 20 match against Ecuador, but she's okay with it.

“If I could choose, I'd rather stay here with all the locals to watch the game together,” she said.

Bakker hopes the matches will make more people around the world aware of Kansas City.

“Growing up in the Netherlands, you say, ‘name me five cities in the United States,' you know, you'll say Miami, New York, San Francisco, Dallas, Los Angeles. And Kansas City would not be on the map,” he said. “I hope that with this event… when they hear that question, that Kansas City might sometimes come up as well.”

The Perot Museum of Nature and Science's interactive soccer exhibit has two top-tier sponsors — Verizon and Amazon — and a host of other corporate partners as it gears up for its March opening a few months before FIFA World Cup matches begin in Dallas-Fort Worth.

The “Soccer: More Than a Game” exhibit is a 10,000-square-foot project that will allow visitors to test their kicking skills, work on game strategy and learn about how innovation is reshaping the sport. 

Linda Silver, the Perot's chief executive officer, told The Dallas Morning News that roughly 75% of the sponsorship opportunities related to the soccer project are new to the museum.

“There will be sponsor signage as people come into the exhibition, so they'll all be recognized there,” Silver said. “So visitors and families will see that Amazon and Verizon are front and center. They will see some of the other sponsor names as well.”

Beginning in June, D-FW is hosting nine World Cup matches, the most of any of the 16 North American sites. 

Michelle Miller, senior vice president at Verizon, said emphasizing the theme “‘Dallas, we've got you covered' is really something that we've been championing across the board. With the World Cup games coming here to Dallas, it was just a perfect connection. We love the fact that it equips visitors with hands-on experiences, so that science and technology and data analytics really are what inspire the future innovators of our community.”

Within the exhibit, Verizon is the presenting sponsor of The Academy, where visitors can display their soccer skills through a bevy of games. Verizon is also a global sponsor of the World Cup, serving as the official telecommunication services sponsor. 

Vickie Yakunin, Amazon's head of community affairs for Texas, said in a statement that because soccer on a global scale embodies “curiosity, creativity and shared purpose,” it aligns well with Amazon's values.

Amazon is the presenting sponsor of the Coaching Lab for Excellence in Athletics, Technology and Science, which will give visitors a deep dive into game strategy and data analytics. 

Currently being built in Salt Lake City, the exhibit opens March 7. It will include numerous stations, including one to build a soccer stadium with Lego-like blocks and scan it into a digital model. The exercise pushes designers to consider energy and water efficiency in their stadium builds.

Since 2022, when Dallas was named a World Cup host city, the Perot has collaborated with Mexico City's Museo Interactivo de Economía, which is known for its interactive takes on economics, finance and sustainability. A companion exhibit at the Mexico museum will further explore the cultural and economic impact of soccer across North America.

“We've also approached sponsors together, because sponsors who want one leg in Mexico City and one leg in Dallas, this is the perfect opportunity for them to get exposure in two countries,” Silver said. “There are some that chose just to sponsor in Mexico City, some that just chose to sponsor here, and some that are getting recognition in both places.”

Manchester United have been told that USMNT star Antonee Robinson could solve a “weakness” in Ruben Amorim's squad. The Red Devils have continued to favour a 3-4-3 system under their Portuguese coach, despite lacking specialists to fill wing-back roles. A raid on Fulham could help to address those issues, with Robinson generating more transfer talk.

The United States international is a natural left-back, with that position being filled for club and country, but has shown with buccaneering forays down the flanks that he is capable of making an impact at both ends of the field.

An impressive tally of assists has been posted for Fulham, with the 28-year-old becoming a key part - when fully fit - of Marco Silva's plans. His exploits have attracted admiring glances from afar.

Liverpool were linked with a raid on Craven Cottage for Robinson heading into the summer of 2025. They ultimately turned their attention towards another domestic rival, with Hungary international Milos Kerkez being prised away from Bournemouth.

A move to Merseyside is still being mooted for Robinson, with Everton now being credited with interest. Fulham would be reluctant to part with the man who has filled their captain's armband at times, but the Cottagers have struggled for consistency as a collective this season.

That could leave them vulnerable to offers from elsewhere, with former United and Fulham full-back Paul Parker suggesting that Amorim and Co. should be looking to lure Robinson to Old Trafford.

Parker, speaking in association with gambling portal British Gambler, told GOAL: “I don't know what's happened at Fulham. I find it very strange. Antonee Robinson has actually fought against adversity. When Fulham got promoted, a lot of the fans were talking about a new left-back. I watched them a few times and he was a player playing with no confidence. He was feeling that because of what was going on in the stands. He was just feeling that way. But all of a sudden, when they got promotion, it was a big transformation. Then he got given the armband.

“He has had a few injuries and hasn't come back and had a run. But he's another one like Tyrick Mitchell. He was a good young left-back when Roy [Hodgson] had him, very steady and came through the ranks to do a good job. He would have been a good steady left-back for Crystal Palace if Roy was still the manager. All of a sudden, a new manager comes in, wing-back, scoring goals, in the box a lot, confident on the ball, moving positions, wow.

“When I look at Robinson, he's 28, I look at [Daniel] Munoz, 29 - up and back, willing to run, can defend, doesn't want anyone in his channel, that's his space. I like Robinson. Again, it's a weakness at United at the moment - no balance on the left-hand side. No balance, no great threat on the left-hand side.”

United have tended to field Portugal international Diogo Dalot at left wing-back, but he is right-footed and more at home in a back four. Patrick Dorgu is another option available to Amorim, but the 21-year-old Dane has struggled to convince in English football and is still waiting on his first goal for the Red Devils.

Noussair Mazraoui is a versatile option at Old Trafford - one capable of operating across the defensive line - while Luke Shaw is left-footed, but has tended to be slotted into Amorim's plans on the side of a back three.

There have been suggestions that Amorim is ready to move away from his 3-4-3 system, at least temporarily as Mazraoui, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad head off on Africa Cup of Nations duty with Morocco, Cameroon and Ivory Coast respectively.

He is likely to revert back to that blueprint at some stage and Robinson - who is preparing to grace a World Cup on American soil next summer and is working on a contract in west London through to 2028 - may register on United's radar in upcoming windows.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Ruben Amorim would be 'really pleased' if Kobbie Mainoo asks him about Man Utd loan transfer as manager responds to Paul Scholes' 'doesn't get the club' criticism","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/ruben-amorim-really-pleased-kobbie-mainoo-man-utd-loan-transfer-responds-paul-scholes-criticism/blta0f79d1683630303","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 08:25:50 GMT","

Ruben Amorim claims that he would be “really pleased” if out-of-favour midfielder Kobbie Mainoo asked him about a January loan transfer away from Manchester United. Questions are being asked of the 20-year-old's future at Old Trafford amid struggles for regular game time. He may need a move in order to compete for a place in England's plans for the 2026 World Cup.

Mainoo has not started a Premier League fixture this season, with his only inclusion from the off in 2025-26 coming in a humbling Carabao Cup defeat to League Two side Grimsby. His 10 outings in the top-flight have all come from off the bench.

Competition for places is fierce at Old Trafford, with experienced stars such as club captain Bruno Fernandes and veteran Brazilian Casemiro filling midfield berths, and that is leading Mainoo to mull over his options.

It has been suggested that the Red Devils academy graduate could push for a move in the new year, with Amorim telling reporters ahead of a meeting with Bournemouth on Monday when asked if those conversations have taken place: “If Kobbie comes to me and talks to me, I will talk to him. I'm not going to say what I'm going to say to Kobbie but I will be really pleased if Kobbie comes to talk to me about that. I just want my players happy and I understand that every individual has their goals.

“The frustration [of any player] doesn't help anybody. But again, the focus is [Bournemouth] and we will see if that happens. I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players but about that subject, no I didn't speak with him. I am completely open [to talk].”

United legend Paul Scholes recently stated that Portuguese tactician Amorim “doesn't get the club”. Quizzed on whether comments such as that are making his job harder, Amorim - who has won only 23 of his 58 games at the helm - said: “No, it's not winning – not winning is the issue. If I'm winning I can go to the games on a horse, arrive there, play with just two defenders and everything will be fine. The problem is that as a manager I'm not doing good enough and that is a fact also. So that is the only problem.

“Me as a manager of Manchester United, we are underachieving. We should have more points, especially this season. So I take that, naturally. Sometimes they [critical former players] don't have all the information and they see Manchester United with the standards that they lived here. Always winning. So it's hard for them to see their club in this situation.”

Scholes also questioned why Mainoo finds himself on the fringes of the fold, with Nicky Butt, Rio Ferdinand and Paul Ince other ex-United stars to have adopted that stance. Amorim added: “I know that for you guys there are some players that you believe in a lot and I believe a lot but sometimes I have to make choices.

“We play with two midfielders. We could change in the future but Kobbie Mainoo is playing in the same position as Bruno Fernandes and sometimes it's really hard to take Bruno Fernandes out of the team and that is the only reason.”

Pressed on whether he rates Mainoo, who made his senior debut in January 2023: “Of course. Like everyone else. Casemiro is the biggest example [of him changing his mind]. He was behind Toby [Collyer, now on loan at West Brom] and now he's a star.”

Amorim added on Mainoo being able to fill the No.6 position as United's holding midfielder: “Yes, he can. I think it was against Everton – I took Casemiro out and I put Kobbie in there because we were trying to play a different game. He can play in that position. But it's hard sometimes. Sometimes Kobbie Mainoo, you have to think [if he is] the guy for blocking transitions. He needs to spend more time there but he can be in that position in the future.”

Mainoo will be hoping to see minutes against Bournemouth, as United look to climb into the Premier League's top five. The Red Devils have fixtures with Aston Villa, Newcastle and Wolves to come before another transfer window opens on January 1.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Alexis Vega returned from injury in the second leg of the Liga MX final to help Toluca secure their 12th league championship, tying Chivas as the competition's second-most successful club. Antonio Mohamed's side won 2-1 on the night to level the series 2-2 on aggregate - after trailing 2-0 earlier in the tie - before lifting the trophy in dramatic fashion.

Toluca confirmed their status as the best team of the year in Liga MX, capturing the Apertura 2025 title and completing a historic back-to-back championship run after surviving a breathtaking penalty shootout against Tigres on Sunday night.

The final was ultimately decided from the spot, with Toluca prevailing 9-8 in a marathon shootout that featured 24 penalties and even saw both goalkeepers miss their attempts. Tigres forward Ángel Correa failed on the decisive kick, opening the door for Alexis Vega - returning after missing the entire Liguilla with injury - to bury the winning penalty and seal the crown for the Diablos Rojos.

Goalkeeper Luis García also played a pivotal role, making multiple saves during the shootout to keep Toluca alive as the tension mounted with each round.

In regulation, Tigres struck first through Fernando Gorriarán in the 14th minute, building on the 1-0 advantage they had secured in the first leg. Toluca responded just before halftime when Brazilian winger Helinho produced a moment of brilliance to level the match and swing momentum back to the hosts.

Early in the second half, Helinho again made his mark, this time as a provider, setting up Paulinho for the 52nd-minute goal that put Toluca ahead on the night and tied the series on aggregate.

Tigres goalkeeper Nahuel Guzmán then took center stage, producing a string of crucial saves in the second half and extra time to keep his team in contention and force penalties, a testament to the resilience of Guido Pizarro's side.

With the victory, Antonio Mohamed lifted his fifth Liga MX title, further cementing his legacy as one of the most successful managers in league history. The championship also marked Toluca's ninth title in the short-tournament era, making them the most decorated club since the format was introduced.

A final that had everything - drama, comebacks, missed penalties, and redemption - ended with Toluca once again at the top of Mexican football.

Alexis Vega and Luis García were Toluca's MVPs in the penalty shootout. Vega converted both of his attempts, with the second one sealing the championship for his team. García, meanwhile, came up big by saving Ángel Correa's shot during sudden death. Special mention also goes to Helinho, who pulled Toluca back into the series with a stunning goal to make it 1-1 while they were trailing 2-0 on aggregate, and later provided the assist for Paulinho's 2-1 finish that leveled the overall score. The Brazilian was instrumental in pushing the series all the way to penalties.

Guido Pizarro suffered a major setback early in his managerial career, as Tigres fell short of claiming what would have been their ninth Liga MX title despite holding a 2–0 aggregate lead in the series. The team was unable to replicate the level they showed in the first leg, where they secured a 1–0 victory.

In the return match, Toluca completely took control, playing with greater intensity and overwhelming Tigres for long stretches. While the outcome of the penalty shootout cannot be placed solely on Pizarro, Tigres had opportunities to protect their advantage or manage the match more effectively in the difficult environment of the Nemesio Diez. Ultimately, their inability to do so allowed Toluca to turn the series around and lift the trophy.

Antonio Conte has admitted his Napoli players were ""too worried and fearful"" during their damaging 1-0 defeat to Udinese on Sunday. The Italian manager urged his squad to develop more ""malice"" and learn the dark arts of time-wasting to manage difficult moments, warning that their lack of character away from home is threatening to derail their Serie A title defence.

Napoli's hopes of retaining their Serie A crown suffered a significant setback on Sunday afternoon as they fell to a solitary goal defeat against Udinese at the Stadio Friuli. In a tightly contested affair that saw the champions struggle to impose their authority, the result has left them vulnerable in the race for the Scudetto, allowing rivals Inter to move into first place in the table.

For Conte, the result was a bitter pill to swallow, particularly given the manner in which his side crumbled in the second half. Napoli had appeared relatively comfortable in the opening 45 minutes, denying the hosts any clear sights of goal. However, the game turned on its head after the interval, with Napoli retreating into their shell and inviting pressure onto themselves. It exposed a psychological fragility that their manager was quick to highlight in his post-match assessment.

""The approach was there,"" Conte said. ""Udinese never had a shot on goal [in the first half], we created a couple of chances that we could have exploited better.

""The second half started with this long throw-in, there were some approximate clearances and we risked conceding a goal. From then on there was a bit of fear, you could see it because in the first 20 minutes of the second half two goals were disallowed, they hit the crossbar, we were a little bit too worried and fearful.

""We will certainly have to work a lot from this point of view. I always tell the boys: we must be good especially in negative moments, when on the pitch you have to take a breath, use a bit of experience and craft, manage situations in which we must improve.""

The defeat highlighted a recurring theme for Napoli this season: a lack of ""street smarts"" when the momentum shifts against them. Conte, a manager renowned for building teams that relish the physical and mental grind of winning, expressed his frustration that his current crop of players are too naive when under the cosh.

The former Chelsea and Tottenham boss suggested his players need to embrace the darker side of the game to break up the opponent's rhythm, adding: ""I told the guys too, we have to be good at managing these moments, because they [the opponents] manage them. With a bit of experience, a bit of malice, wasting time on the pitch too.

""After that, [you must] not lose courage, not get overwhelmed by the fear of conceding a goal. Because then if the attitude is this, you call the goal upon yourself and we called it upon ourselves. There is work to be done in this aspect.""

Conte was careful not to absolve his players of blame but emphasised that character traits are harder to coach than tactical systems. He pointed to a lack of vocal leadership on the pitch as a critical flaw, noting that in difficult away environments, personality is often more valuable than technical ability.

""I have nothing to reproach these guys for, who are giving everything in an emergency,"" he continued. ""It is inevitable that if I go to analyse some situations, especially away from home, we have to be better at managing it, talking more, bringing out character. Because there, beyond the footballer, the person must make themselves heard.

""Perhaps it is the most difficult aspect to work on: on a psychological level you try to work and find the right way, but many times there are footballers who have charisma and personality and we from this point of view must grow and can grow. They are excellent guys, I would like to help them grow from this point of view too because the whole team would benefit from it.""

The loss to Udinese was not an isolated incident but rather the continuation of a worrying trend. During his post-match address, Conte pointed to a grim statistic to underline the scale of their struggles, lamenting that his side have now lost seven matches away from home across all competitions.

""The alarm bell I gave even when we won, because these are situations that in the long run... There is little to say,"" Conte remarked. ""At the beginning of the year anyway, when you play many competitions, you worry about making a squad up to par. If then for external reasons this squad is reduced anyway you can hold up, but in the end you have to pay for something, otherwise we would all be phenomena, the guys, me.

""You have to pay something, but precisely by virtue of this we must continue to do what we are doing. Unity, compactness, we must not lose enthusiasm and motivation.""

Despite the gloom surrounding the result, Conte remained defiant about the path forward. He acknowledged that the current season was always going to be a struggle and called for unity from everyone associated with the club. However, he refused to hide from the reality that conceding control for 20-minute spells - as they did against Udinese - is a habit that must be broken immediately if they are to salvage their season.

""Anyway for us this year will not be a simple year,"" Conte concluded. ""But the important thing is to always want to be united, compact and face difficulties trying to improve. Then some things are objective and under everyone's eyes, but I don't want to highlight or say some situations.

""We must go forward in our work, knowing that the whole environment must be close to the team because it will not be a very simple year for us. We all know it, we want to work and fight knowing we have lost seven away games: there is little to say... When the wind goes the opposite way we must improve because we must know how to travel even with the wind against us.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Another new chapter for Thiago Silva? PSG & Chelsea legend could leave Fluminense after surprise dressing room gesture","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/new-chapter-thiago-silva-psg-chelsea-legend-could-leave-fluminense-surprise-gesture/blt784cf33cb892c2d6","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 13:59:39 GMT","

Another chapter may be opening in Thiago Silva's remarkable career after the veteran defender appeared to say goodbye to his Fluminense teammates following their elimination by Vasco in the Copa do Brasil semi-final. Despite having a contract until mid-2026, the Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea legend now faces an uncertain future, with retirement or a move back to Europe both firmly on the table.

Silva's future at Fluminense has been thrown into doubt after the 41-year-old addressed his team-mates in the dressing room, as per GeGlobo, following their Copa do Brasil semi-final elimination against Vasco. The defender, who returned to his boyhood club in mid-2024, is understood to have bid farewell to the squad in a gesture that strongly suggested his time at the club could be coming to an earlier-than-expected end. While his contract officially runs until June 2026, the moment was interpreted internally as more than a routine reaction to defeat.

The centre-back was one of Fluminense's standout performers on the night, producing a commanding display across the two-legged semi-final tie. In the second leg, Silva converted his penalty in a shootout that ultimately decided who would progress to the final. Fluminense were unable to complete the comeback, and the defeat brought their cup campaign to a close in emotionally charged circumstances.

In the aftermath of the elimination, it emerged that Silva has already communicated his openness to leaving the club. According to reports in Brazil, the defender has no intention of retiring immediately and is instead exploring the possibility of continuing his career elsewhere. His decision appears to have been influenced by personal factors rather than dissatisfaction with Fluminense's sporting project.

Since returning to Brazil, Silva has been separated from his immediate family, who remain based in London due to his children's involvement in Chelsea's youth academy. That distance has been described as a growing burden, and it has played a central role in his willingness to consider terminating his Fluminense contract well before its original expiry date.

The uncertainty has also prompted speculation about a return to Europe, with Italian media recently linking Silva to AC Milan, one of his former clubs. While no concrete move has been confirmed, the idea of finishing his career closer to his family while remaining competitive is believed to be appealing. At the same time, Silva has publicly spoken about his ambition to play at the next World Cup, a goal that suggests he still views himself as capable of performing at an elite level rather than winding down his career in Brazil.

From Fluminense's perspective, the situation is being handled with caution. Club officials are reportedly keen to hold talks with Silva in the coming days and hope the emotional weight of the Vasco elimination may have influenced his dressing room gesture. Internally, there is still optimism that the defender could be persuaded to remain at least until July 2026, particularly given his influence on and off the pitch and the club's qualification for the Copa Libertadores after finishing fifth in Serie A.

Silva's career places him firmly among the greatest defenders of his generation, defined by longevity, consistency and leadership across multiple elite environments. After overcoming a life-threatening battle with tuberculosis early in his career, he rebuilt his reputation at Fluminense before starring for AC Milan, where he won the Serie A title, and later captained Paris Saint-Germain during a period of domestic dominance. His eight years in Paris yielded seven Ligue 1 titles and established him as one of Europe's most reliable centre-backs.

His move to Chelsea in 2020, at the age of 35, initially raised eyebrows but quickly silenced doubters. Silva became a cornerstone of the Blues' defence and played a pivotal role in their Champions League triumph in 2021, finally claiming the European crown that had eluded him at PSG and AC Milan. Over four seasons in west London, he made more than 150 appearances and earned widespread admiration for his composure, tactical intelligence and leadership.

Returning to Fluminense in 2024 was framed as a homecoming and a symbolic closing of the circle. Even at 41, Silva has remained a key figure, making 46 appearances this season across all competitions, scoring four goals and providing two assists. His performances have reinforced his reputation as an ageless defender, capable of reading the game and leading younger team-mates through example.

Silva now faces a defining decision as he weighs his future beyond Fluminense. Talks with the club are expected in the coming days, with management keen to understand whether his dressing room farewell was a definitive goodbye. Their priority will be clarity, both to plan for the upcoming season and to manage the potential loss of one of the most significant figures.

If Silva does decide to leave, his next move remains open-ended. A return to Europe would allow him to be closer to his family and potentially maintain the competitive environment he believes is necessary to keep his World Cup ambitions alive. Retirement, while previously mentioned as an option at the end of his contract, now appears less likely given his stated desire to continue playing and his strong performances throughout the season.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","AC Milan not giving up on Mike Maignan as director promises contract talks with 'extraordinary' Chelsea and Juventus target","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/ac-milan-not-giving-up-mike-maignan-director-promises-contract-talks-extraordinary-chelseaMi-juventus-target/blt7499a2a9ca2265ef","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 10:55:02 GMT","

AC Milan sporting director Igli Tare has insisted that the club have no intention of parting ways with Mike Maignan, promising that contract talks will take place with the goalkeeper soon. The French shot-stopper has attracted significant interest from Chelsea and Juventus as his current deal winds down, but Tare maintains that the 'extraordinary' custodian is happy at San Siro.

The director has moved to quell the growing speculation surrounding the future of the star goalkeeper. The French international is approaching a critical juncture in his career with his contract expiring at the end of the season and his future yet to be resolved. This uncertainty has alerted Europe's elite, with Premier League giants Chelsea and Serie A rivals Juventus reportedly monitoring developments closely.

Chelsea have long been admirers of Maignan as they continue their search for a long-term, world-class number one, while Juventus view him as a potential market opportunity to weaken a direct rival and secure their own defensive future. However, speaking ahead of Milan's clash with Sassuolo, Tare remained defiant. He emphasised the strong bond between the player and the club, suggesting that while financial discussions have not yet formally concluded, the mutual desire to continue the relationship is evident.

""Maignan renewal? We have never talked about numbers,"" Tare told the press. ""Talking about Mike is easy, he is an extraordinary boy and a great leader.

""He likes being at Milan and Milan likes him being here, but now let's think about the game and then we will talk about it.""

Tare's comments highlight Maignan's importance beyond just his saves. Since arriving from Lille, Maignan has established himself as a vocal leader in the dressing room, having been appointed club captain earlier this year. His ability to organise the defence and his distribution skills are pivotal to Milan's style of play.

Losing such an influential figure to a domestic rival like Juventus would be a catastrophic blow to the Rossoneri's project, while a move to Chelsea would leave a void that is notoriously difficult to fill. By delaying the talks until ""after the game"" and focusing on the immediate on-pitch matters, Tare is attempting to shield the squad from distractions as they navigate a tight Serie A title race with rivals Inter and Napoli.

Beyond the Maignan saga, Tare also provided insight into Milan's strategy for the upcoming January transfer window. With the winter market notoriously difficult for finding value, the director tempered expectations regarding major new arrivals. Instead, he pointed to the internal growth of the squad and the return of key players from injury as the primary source of improvement for the second half of the season.

Tare specifically highlighted the situations of Christopher Nkunku and Santiago Gimenez - high-profile attackers who have had mixed fortunes since joining the club. Nkunku, who showed flashes of his brilliance in the recent match against Torino, is seen as a player ready to explode, while Gimenez is currently sidelined with an ankle issue.

""It is very difficult [the January window], we will be attentive and see if there is something that can improve this team and we will do it,"" Tare explained regarding potential signings. ""But for now the team is growing, including Nkunku in the second half in Turin.

""Today is a great opportunity to see the real Nkunku, who we are all waiting for. Gimenez is having this problem [with his ankle] but we are waiting for him to truly see what he is capable of.""

The comments suggest that Milan will not be held to ransom in January, preferring to trust the investments they have already made. For Nkunku, the pressure is on to deliver the consistency that made him a star in the Bundesliga, while Gimenez's recovery will be crucial for providing rotation and competition in the final third.

However, the priority remains resolving Maignan's future. With every week that passes without a signature, the whispers of a move to London or Turin will only grow louder. Tare's public show of confidence is the first step, but the Rossoneri faithful will only relax once the ""extraordinary"" Frenchman puts pen to paper.

AC Milan's slip up in the 2-2 draw with Sassuolo saw them give up their place at the top of Serie A to Inter, who sit a point clear of them after the weekend's results. They will aim to bounce back with a vital win against reigning Italian champions Napoli in the Supercoppa Italiana semi-final on Thursday.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Cole Palmer's stunning return to action at Stamford Bridge against Everton has drawn extraordinary praise from inside the Chelsea dressing room. The attacking star opened the scoring for the Blues against the Toffees, and Wesley Fofana later compared his team-mate to his highly successful compatriots, Kylian Mbappe and Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele.

Chelsea secured a crucial Premier League victory over Everton at Stamford Bridge, with Palmer marking his return to the club's home ground in emphatic fashion. The 23-year-old opened the scoring with a composed finish past Jordan Pickford, setting the tone for a performance that underlined his importance to Enzo Maresca's side.

The match represented a significant moment for Palmer, who had not featured at Stamford Bridge since the opening day of the season, as injury problems, including groin issues, had restricted his involvement and limited him to just a handful of Premier League starts. Despite those setbacks, Palmer looked sharp and influential from the outset against the Toffees through the first half.

Although he was withdrawn after 58 minutes as Maresca managed his workload, Palmer's impact on the Blues' performance was clear. His movement, decision-making and composure in possession consistently unsettled an Everton side that could have posed trouble to Chelsea if they were handed enough opportunities.

Speaking after the match, Fofana offered glowing praise of Palmer, placing the Englishman among the very elite attackers he has played alongside. He said: “He's from a different planet. He's close to the likes of Mbappe and Dembele, very, very close. I play with them for France, and they're very good players, but he's right at the top.”

Fofana also stressed Palmer's influence, even in a managed appearance. “Everyone can see it, even though he only played 58 minutes; the fans can see his importance,” the defender explained. “He's the best player in our team when he's on the pitch. He's different. He's a star.”

The Frenchman went on to reflect on Chelsea's wider situation during a demanding run of fixtures. “It has been a hard month, and it's not finished because we have games coming every two or three days,” Fofana added. “We are trying to give everything. The manager and the staff have managed the team well… The most important thing is to keep the guys fit and to try to win games.”

Palmer's rise has been one of the standout stories in English football over the past two seasons. After coming through Manchester City's academy and contributing in big moments, he moved to Chelsea in search of regular football, and that decision quickly paid off, as he became the Blues' primary attacking reference point almost immediately.

During his first full season at Stamford Bridge, Palmer delivered elite-level output, combining goals, assists and match-winning performances. His calmness from the penalty spot and ability to decide games in key moments earned him individual recognition and cemented his status as Chelsea's most reliable attacking threat.

This season, however, has tested Palmer in different ways, as injuries have disrupted his rhythm and forced Chelsea to manage his minutes carefully. Even so, performances like the Everton display and his showing at the Club World Cup make it difficult for his name to be ignored in conversations about the best young players in the world.

Chelsea face a relentless run of fixtures, beginning with a Carabao Cup quarter-final away at Cardiff before a packed December schedule continues. Maresca has already indicated that Palmer cannot yet be relied upon for consistent starts, meaning rotation will remain a key part of his management plan.

For Palmer, the focus will be on building fitness and maintaining availability rather than rushing minutes. Chelsea are acutely aware of how central he is to their attacking identity, and are set to be mindful of the long-term picture. As for Fofana's comparison, Palmer's standing in the dressing room and being likened to Mbappe and Dembele sets an significant benchmark, and Chelsea believe he has the talent to justify such lofty company.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Hollywood megastar Timothee Chalamet tells Lamine Yamal to 'dream big' alongside iconic photo of Barcelona sensation with Lionel Messi as wonderkid dons 'Marty Supreme' jacket to promote new film","https://www.goal.com/en-qa/lists/timothee-chalamet-lamine-yamal-dream-big-barcelona-lionel-messi-marty-supreme/bltc8be1f27a3e12cdc","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 10:35:36 GMT","

Hollywood superstar Timothee Chalamet has used Barcelona wonderkid Lamine Yamal to help promote his new film ‘Marty Supreme', with the teenage forward living proof that you should always 'dream big'. Chalamet has shared an iconic image of teen sensation Yamal alongside Argentine GOAT Lionel Messi to help hammer home his point that anything is possible.

Yamal famously starred in an advertising campaign with Barcelona legend Messi when just a baby. That picture has resurfaced on countless occasions since, with it remarkable to think that that new arrival to the world is now following in the most illustrious of footsteps.

Having made his own way through the fabled La Masia academy system, making his senior debut at just 15 years of age, Yamal is now considered to be a suitable heir to Messi's crown as the king of world football.

Yamal's exploits have, just like Messi, attracted interest from across the globe. His level of celebrity already transcends his chosen profession, with the youngster much more than a football player. He boasts support in every corner of the planet.

That includes Hollywood, with famous faces in the United States fully aware of who Yamal is and what he is capable of. His story is an intriguing one and helps to showcase what can be achieved through a mixture of ability and hard work.

Chalamet - the star of blockbuster movies such as ‘Wonka' and ‘Dune', who is dating Kim Kardashian's sister Kylie Jenner - is among those to have been taken in by Yamal's remarkable rise to prominence.

He is, as an A-list actor, somebody that appreciates an inspirational true story. He is proving as much after returning to the big screen in ‘Marty Supreme' - a tale loosely inspired by American table tennis player Marty Reisman and his pursuit of fame in 1950s New York.

Chalamet is driving interest in that production, which hits cinemas on December 25, with a global promotional tour. He has drafted in assistance from Barcelona talisman Yamal, with the 18-year-old seen sporting the viral ‘Marty Supreme' jacket.

Chalamet has shared an image of Yamal in that merchandise alongside a “DREAM BIG” message. He has also made a point of including the aforementioned photo of Yamal with eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi in an Instagram carousel.

The picture in question was taken back in 2007 as part of a photoshoot for UNICEF. Joan Monfort, a Barcelona-based freelance photographer for the Associated Press, took the snap - which took on a life of its own after being shared on social media by Yamal's father Mounir Nasraoui alongside the tagline: “The beginning of two legends.”

Monfort has since said of capturing an iconic moment: “UNICEF did a raffle in the neighbourhood of Roca Fonda in Mataro where Lamine's family lived. They signed up for the raffle to have their picture taken at the Camp Nou with a Barca player. And they won the raffle.

“He [Messi] didn't even know how to hold him at first. Messi is a pretty introverted guy, he's shy. He was coming out of the locker room and suddenly he finds himself in another locker room with a plastic tub full of water and a baby in it. It was complicated.

“It's very exciting to be associated with something that has caused such a sensation. It's been really surprising, all this. We take so many photos, so many images. Some of them will remain.

“For Lamine to grow up to be a footballer, and to have this photo, I'm just really happy it happened. It's especially nice in today's football, when so much is to do with money and power.”

Yamal has sought to distance himself from the Messi comparisons that he continues to generate, with there a desire on his part to forge a unique legacy of his own. He is already a La Liga and European Championship title winner with Barcelona and Spain, with the expectation being that he will continue to “dream big” in the not too distant future when landing a first Ballon d'Or.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

My Untold Story: Melissa Birk – Kick Sauber Junior Infrastructure Designer

My Untold Story: Mark Chircop – Ferrari Software Analytics Manager

Lawrence Barretto's new F1 TV series Off The Grid sees him spending time with the great and the good of the F1 paddock away from the racetrack. In the second episode, he heads to Milan to meet Alpine's Pierre Gasly.

When a Formula 1 driver arrives at a racetrack, he selects full race mode and puts everything else out of his mind to focus on the day job. Over the course of the last decade covering the sport, that's usually the mode they're engaged in when I get to talk to them through my role as an interviewer for F1. But for a change of pace and as part of an exclusive new series, I headed Off The Grid to hang out with the sport's elite racers away from the office.

In episode two, French racer and Grand Prix winner Pierre Gasly invited me to Milan, the place he now calls home. The 29-year-old, who like his rival Oscar Piastri in episode one gave up one of his rare days off to take part in filming (rather than via mandatory team media or commercial time), talks about the pain of losing one of his closest friends, his demotion from Red Bull and resurgence at AlphaTauri, his relationship with fellow French racer Esteban Ocon and the next chapter with Alpine.

Pierre Gasly's grandmother was a regional kart champion, his grandfather competed, too. So it's perhaps no surprise that Gasly found himself sat behind the wheel of a kart, which he borrowed from Ocon, when he was six and instantly fell in love with it.

""The speed, the fear, the adrenaline I felt on that day was so strong, I can still remember it even if it was 23 years ago,"" he says when we chat on his very comfortable sofa in his Milan apartment. ""I fell in love with the sport straightaway.""

The Frenchman battled his way through the junior ranks, catching the eye of Red Bull, who brought him into the family as part of their junior programme. He went on to win GP2 – the feeder series to Formula 1 at the time – in his second full-time campaign, and hoped that that would be enough to earn promotion to a Formula 1 seat. Unfortunately, he missed out.

""It was so hard to take as I was told, 'If you win the GP2 championship you are going to get a shot in Formula 1',"" he says. ""It was like a slam in my face. I thought, 'Okay, what do I need to do more?' I kept the mentality that I would get my shot.""

Gasly kept his head down, focused on the testing opportunities he got with Red Bull and Toro Rosso – and then the phone rang. It was Dr Helmut Marko, Red Bull's recently-departed motorsport advisor.

""I remember I was jumping on my bed in Malaysia,"" he says. ""I went as a reserve for Red Bull. He called me to say get ready – this weekend, you are racing. When I got the shot, I was the happiest. I remember going on the grid and knowing I'm given this chance, now it's in my hands, I have the car, the team, the people – now it's up to me and I'm in control.

""I did four or five races in 2017, and then I started the season in 2018. In the second race, bang – P4 in Bahrain. It created straight away massive hype. Right after Budapest, Daniel [Ricciardo] announced he was leaving [Red Bull]. I remember arriving in Greece for my holiday, and it was like, 'Whoa, Daniel is going'.

""Red Bull had Carlos Sainz as an option and they had me. It's between Sainz and myself. The phone rang and Helmut told me 'Okay, you're a Red Bull Racing driver at start of next year – this was six months into my first [full] season in F1.""

We take a break from filming to have a tour around his very tidy apartment. The carpets were all ripped up shortly after he and his girlfriend got their dog Simba. The smooth floors provide endless entertainment for Simba as he excitedly zooms around the apartment on the slippery surface as Gasly shows us around. His balcony offers stunning views across Milan – and is where he often hangs out with friends when he gets some downtime between races.

He's got a games room, complete with simulator and framed shirts of his favourite footballers, including Lionel Messi, who he met while on holiday. Gasly is big into football, so much so, he became a co-owner of French third division club FC Versailles.

We switch back to chat mode – and get into his unfortunately short stint at Red Bull. ""I'm not going to lie, it was sad,"" he says. ""2019, my second year in Formula 1 – there was no support from anywhere, in a very big team which is very much supporting Max [Verstappen] – for good reasons, because he's put on the results.

""But I'm starting with a fresh engineer coming from Formula E who didn't have experience in F1. So it was a strange dynamic. I wasn't really given the tools to really perform. I tried to fight my own way because I wanted, and at the end of the day I'm there to, perform. They were not happy, but I'm not happy too because I could see I couldn't show my potential.""

Gasly was demoted back to Toro Rosso after around six months of racing. ""It almost felt like a relief,"" he says. His first race back was the Belgian Grand Prix and it turned out to be the most intense weekend of his life. Naturally, all the questioning on media day was about his demotion.

""It's not a nice energy,"" he says. ""I'm there to do my thing and try and give my best but it's a lot of negativity. I go through that. I just want to drive. Then came Saturday...""

His friend Anthoine Hubert, with whom he raced in karting from aged nine to around 14, suffered a fatal accident on the second lap of the F2 feature race at Spa, at the same venue where Gasly was set to compete in his first race back with Toro Rosso.

Gasly and Hubert were like brothers growing up. They ate breakfast together, went to class together, trained together. Gasly would do 13 push ups, so Hubert would do 14. They pushed each other to get the very best out of each other.

""Initially, I didn't know who was involved,"" says Gasly, ""It looked bad. The team manager told me Anthoine was involved. As soon as the briefing was done, I ran down to get more info. I saw in the distance my parents just broken in tears. Sadly I understood straight away what had happened.""

He adds: ""You get taught a lot at school and by your parents but you never get told how you're supposed to deal with yourself in this sort of situation. The one thing I regret is that in Budapest after the race [before the summer break], we went to party with Anthoine.

""I didn't want to leave too late. I tried to find him but I couldn't find him. I walked out, I saw him on the terrace. I waved at him and said 'have a good summer and see you at Spa'. I never got to see him again before the crash.

""I just wish I waited a bit longer in the club to hug him or say bye in a slightly different way. It taught me to appreciate the moment we live, with the people we love, and just to never take anything for granted.""

We take a break from the chat to head out onto the streets of Milan in search of Gasly's favourite coffee place. There's naturally a vast selection of sweet treats on offer – and while the Frenchman admits he does take one every now and then, the ones he says he chooses are not much bigger than a Malteser because it won't take him long to burn off on a treadmill.

It's then onto his favourite store in the city for a bit of retail therapy. Gasly loves his fashion, which won't be a surprise if you've ever seen him in his civvies.

""I want to discover other worlds,"" he says. ""The first time I came to Milan, I was staring at how beautiful the people were. The style... everyone is so elegant. I've seen the coolest grandmas walking around town. When you go out, you need to make sure you wear some nice stuff.""

Gasly is a stylish guy. He's also a guy who knows what he wants, so it doesn't take him long to pick out a few pieces.

It's then back to his story. We recall the 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix, where he out-dragged Lewis Hamilton to the line to take second – and his first podium. It's a special moment in his life – and one that he is reminded of every day as a painting of that drag race is up on the wall behind his sofa.

""People wrote me off too quickly because they don't know me, they don't know what sort of mindset and mentality I have,"" he says. ""This is my whole life. Thinking of that podium still puts me a smile on my face.""

Gasly is incredibly tough and oozes resilience. That's perhaps not surprising given how much heartache he's endured before he's even turned 30. It's that mental strength that has enabled him to rebuild his career – and led to him achieving his first Grand Prix victory in Monza, the home of his then-AlphaTauri team, in 2020.

“It was incredible, which is why I took that moment on the podium, to process the millions of emotions and thoughts that crossed my mind. I was in my own world. These few seconds, I'll keep with me forever.

""It was a unique moment as it was Covid, so there was no one there. The one year where Monza never looked that empty. It was a bit of a shame, but it gives me a good reason to win again in Monza!""

While Gasly hoped for a shot back at the main Red Bull team, that never looked likely – so when Alpine came calling for 2023, he grasped the opportunity. ""I put pen to paper on Anthoine's birthday,"" says Gasly. ""Anthoine was an Alpine [Academy] driver. Everything fell into place on Anthoine's birthday – I couldn't believe it.""

That put Gasly alongside Ocon at Alpine. The two have history. ""We could make a full documentary about this,"" he says. ""We used to spend Wednesdays and weekends together pretty much every week, him going to my place, me going to his place. We had a strong bond.

""Sadly, there was a turning point in one of the races; it sort of fell apart after that in a dramatic way which is difficult to explain. We know exactly where we come from. We know what we had to go through to make it. We also both know it was actually a good thing that we had that rivalry to push us beyond our potential. I have no doubt that in 10, 20 years we'll be able to talk things out and talk things through in a different way.""

That relationship seems to be improving, as was evidenced when they embraced each other on the podium in Brazil in 2024 after scoring an unlikely double podium for Alpine.

""In the space of eight months, we went from last to getting not one but two cars on the podium,"" he says. ""The faces on the team were priceless. It was one of those races where I'm sure post-career, I'll pinpoint it as very special.""

Gasly has emerged as Alpine's team leader, his most recent contract extension meaning he's set to stay at the team for six years. The hunger to succeed is unwavering – and he firmly believes he has what it takes to reach the very top.

What do the next five years look like for him? ""F1 and hopefully, with Alpine, World Champion!"" he says. ""I know it's difficult for people to process. How can I say that if we're fighting for just a few points, but I believe with the people we have, I can see us fighting at the front.""

Given the way Gasly has fought back from a succession of knockbacks to recover each time, it would be unwise to bet against him. Alpine just need to give him a car that can fight at the sharp end, and then it'll be up to him to deliver.

You can watch the full episode of Off The Grid with Pierre Gasly exclusively on F1 TV now.

My Untold Story: Melissa Birk – Kick Sauber Junior Infrastructure Designer

My Untold Story: Mark Chircop – Ferrari Software Analytics Manager

Haas driver Esteban Ocon talks about his life and career so far in the very last of our Getting to Know interviews.

Esteban Ocon is the final driver to experience F1.com's quickfire Getting to Know questions. From growing up admiring Michael Schumacher to an amusing series of interviews after his driving test, and his passion for superhero comics to a potential side quest tuning cars, the Haas man shares all in the video player above and transcript below…

Can you describe yourself in three words?

Three words to describe myself… Motivated, a hard worker, and I don't know… Maybe I'll let the people comment on the last one!

Drop it in the comments…

Exactly!

What made you fall in love with F1? Is there a moment watching on TV as a kid that stands out?

Yeah, I think Michael Schumacher was the driver who made me fall in love with F1. I remember watching the Monaco Grand Prix where he was leading and then suddenly after the tunnel… You couldn't see back then, the quality in the tunnel was not so great… I saw him with not all the wheels attached to the car, and he lost that race. For some reason, that broke my heart at the time. I didn't know him so well, I'd heard people talking about him, but those moments shock you as a kid. That is still in there somewhere. It's quite a moment that strikes me.

When and where did you first drive something?

The first time... I remember I had a little Ferrari with pedals. We were living in a very small flat with my parents, my parents put it outside the door for an evening, and I remember the following morning I went to take the car and it wasn't there – I got it stolen. It was a heartbreaking moment, really. That was the first thing I drove when I was young.

It's sad to hear that… But it worked out okay in the long run!

Yes, yes!

There's a lot of pressure on this next question… How many times did it take you to pass your driving test?

It took me one month in total. In France you have to do 20 hours minimum. I passed everything first go. I was very proud because the teacher basically told me, ‘You were the best I've had in a while'. I was like, ‘Pretty good, then!', I was happy. It was quite a stressful time, because there were some journalists who were outside. The [instructor] didn't know what they were here for, because I was already testing F1 before I got my driving licence. I really didn't want him to know, because if he had a bad thought, he would not have given it to me, but he said I was the best in a while, so I was happy.

Already like going to the TV pen after your driving test, then…

(Laughs) Basically that, yeah!

Who's your best friend inside the paddock?

It has to be Lance [Stroll] and Mick [Schumacher]. We really got along super well, also outside the track, so they are my two best friends around the F1 paddock.

Which three F1 personalities past or present would you invite to a dinner party and why?

Probably Ayao [Komatsu, Haas team boss] and Ollie [Bearman, Ocon's team mate]. I think it would be a fun one.

Keep it in the family…

For sure, yeah. If we've got something to celebrate, that's cool!

We know you're a big fan of Marvel Comics… What is your biggest interest or hobby outside F1?

That's a big passion of mine. I'm really into comics, Marvel Comics in particular. We have some exciting movies coming out next year, which are going to be awesome. A new Spider-Man, new Avengers. It's going to be really cool, I can't wait for that. I've got something special coming soon as well, which will be very nice, and I hope all the fans will love it! It's going to come before the end of the year, so stay in touch...

Outside of that, I like doing sports with the people I love, mountain biking, going to the gym together… But I'm a big petrolhead as well, going to work with my dad on cars, on racing buggies, on go-karts, I like to put my hands into it… RC (Remote Control) cars as well. It's something I do probably a lot more than a lot of drivers. Probably Fernando [Alonso] is very similar in that case, but I like these things, for sure.

What's your favourite film of all time?

I think it contradicts what I said before, because I'm a big fan of Marvel, but my favourite movie is The Dark Knight Rises, so it's actually Batman, kind of. It's more The Dark Knight than Batman. That has to be my favourite. It's DC Comics, and I'm not the biggest fan of DC Comics in general otherwise, but that one with Christian Bale is something insane. Then it's Iron Man and Spiderman!

What's the best holiday you've been on?

I think the last holidays that we had with my family were amazing. Going to the sea… I think it doesn't really matter where you are going, in the end it's who you spend it with. Going with my love, my family, and I think that's the best thing. There's nothing more that matters.

And what about the craziest travel experience you've had?

Probably going to Lapland or something. That's insane. You land, everything's frozen, then you get to drive to the hotel or a little house, all the cars have spiked tyres otherwise you don't move forward, it's minus 40 [degrees]… Yeah, that's probably the wildest experience. Seeing people with the dogs that they carry, like Santa!

What's the best advice you've ever received?

It's a good question. I think it has to be from my dad. When I was young, we were sacrificing a lot, I didn't have a normal kid's life when I was 10 or 12. He told me, ‘The most important time of your life is now, it's what's going to define your future. If we succeed, you will not have any regrets'. That was probably the best piece of advice, because you put everything negative on the side and you just go for it. Yes, I didn't have a normal childhood, but here I am living the dream and living the best life possible.

Which other job do you wish you could try for a day? A superhero, maybe?

(Laughs) That would be nice! If I could jump in an Iron Man suit and take off… I would like to spend a bit more time tuning cars, but from the electronics point of view. I've got a lot of people I know very well who spend a lot of time on dynos, trying to get more power out of the engines. I'm very good at understanding the outside hardware of things, but not the software inside – it's quite complicated, once you start to put numbers… That's the bit where I would like to learn a bit more, so doing an internship in some dyno testing would be nice.

Otherwise, I don't know, maybe… It's still related to cars, but swapping seats with some drift championship guys would be nice. Not for too long, but for a day! I did the WRC (World Rally Championship) as well already, which was insane. There are so many things to try, really. I was talking with my girlfriend not too long ago, and obviously I still have a long time to be racing, but I've done that all my life. I've never really thought about doing something else, because that's all I wanted to do. One day it will come, and I will have to think about that, so let's see!

What's your proudest moment in F1 so far? A few spring to mind, but what's top of the list?

Well, it has to be my win in Budapest [in 2021] – that's the most crazy one. Monaco 2023 was also very special, because that was unexpected, but it was on merit – it was very well-deserved. I'm not going to say Brazil last year was not on merit, because it was, but it's more conditions that levels up the cars. I take less credit for the Brazil drive than the one in Monaco, for some reason. Even though it was much harder in Brazil than Monaco… Monaco we were not supposed to be on the podium… Also not Brazil! (Laughs) But Monaco rewards you on the dry and it is special, the quali lap, and nailing all the laps in the race. Both are special, but I will definitely take Monaco.

I think I'll remember that Brazil weekend for the rest of my life…

It was crazy! It was crazy... Especially in a tough time like I had at the end of last year. It reminds me and gives me the confidence that I'm here and I can do it. At the end of the day, I'm here because I've proved that I can do it, and it definitely felt nice.

Finally, where do you want to be in five years' time?

World Champion! That would be nice… It's all the matters.

The two-time Emmy winner and Oscar nominee and his wife, Michele, were found dead in their Brentwood home. Their son Nick has been arrested.


							By 

	Deborah Wilker



Rob Reiner, who directed such beloved Hollywood classics as This Is Spinal Tap, Stand by Me and When Harry Met Sally after starring in the trailblazing sitcom All in the Family, died Sunday along with his wife, Michele, in their Brentwood home. He was 78.


	Reiner and his wife, 70, were found dead in their home on Chadbourne Avenue, with the couple “suffering lacerations consistent with a knife,” law enforcement sources told TMZ. There reportedly was no sign of forced entry.




	Said a spokesperson for the family: “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.”

					Two People Found Dead at Rob Reiner's House in Los Angeles; LAPD Investigating ""Apparent Homicide""		
			









	The Reiners' son Nick, 32, has been arrested by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. He battled drug addiction and homelessness, had more than a dozen stints in rehab and co-wrote a film loosely based on his life, Being Charlie (2015), that was directed by his father.


	Near the scene Sunday just before 9 p.m., LAPD chief of detectives Alan Hamilton said “we have not identified a suspect at this time,” there “was no person of interest” and that many family members would be interviewed.


	The Los Angeles Fire Department had been called to the Reiners' home at about 3:40 p.m. by an unidentified person, and LAPD Robbery Homicide Division detectives were investigating. 

	











The Princess Bride (1987), Misery (1990), the Oscar best picture nominee A Few Good Men (1992), The American President (1995) and The Bucket List (2007) also were among Rob Reiner's 20-plus directing credits.


	Reiner was also a co-founder of Castle Rock Entertainment, the production company behind such films as City Slickers (1991), The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Waiting for Guffman (1996), Miss Congeniality (2000), Best in Show (2000), Michael Clayton (2007) and Seinfeld, one of the most lucrative television properties of all time.


	From the outset of his feature directorial career with This Is Spinal Tap (1984), Reiner seemed to reimagine Hollywood standards, creating and starring in the first mainstream mockumentary — a rock 'n' roll satire so dead-on, film critic Roger Ebert called it “one of the funniest movies ever made.” From there, he would move seamlessly from comedy to drama, from fantasy to horror, as few directors ever have.


	Reiner would establish yet another benchmark — this time for romantic comedies — with When Harry Met Sally (1989), screenwriter Nora Ephron's ode to true love (based loosely on her and Reiner's lives) that starred Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.


	His biggest box office hit, the gripping courtroom drama A Few Good Men, based on Aaron Sorkin's 1989 play and starring Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson, could not have been more different.


	Some of Reiner's movies took a while to capture the world's attention. The Princess Bride, his timeless fairy tale adventure that was based on the William Goldman novel and starred Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin and Peter Falk, was one of several films that grew in popularity over decades on the way to cult status.

	











	On television, Reiner played to some of the biggest audiences in history, first in the role of Michael “Meathead” Stivic, the liberal antagonist of Carroll O'Connor's Archie Bunker, on CBS' All in the Family, and then as a ground-floor executive on NBC's Seinfeld, which he fought to keep on the air. 


	“We knew we had a great show,” Reiner told Howard Stern in 2016. 


	But after a rocky launch in the summer of 1989, the network was concerned that Seinfeld — famously a show “about nothing” — was a misfire. After four episodes, it was on the brink of cancellation.


	“I went in there and had a screaming crazy thing with [NBC president] Brandon Tartikoff,” Reiner said. “And I promised him — there will be stories!”


	In 1993, Reiner and Castle Rock partners Andrew Scheinman, Alan Horn, Glenn Padnick and Martin Shafer sold their company to broadcast mogul Ted Turner for about $160 million. (It became part of Time Warner when it acquired Turner Broadcasting in 1996.) 


	The principals stayed on, holding to their original ideal: to make independent movies outside the traditional studio system. But after a run of poorly performing films starting in the late '90s, Castle Rock initiated layoffs and eventually was absorbed into Warner Bros.


	In 2020, Reiner relaunched the company and revived its film division a year later, with Spinal Tap II: The End Continues (2025) among its offerings. 

	











	“There's not one film that I've ever made that could get made today by a studio, not one — even A Few Good Men,” Reiner said. “Every movie that I make, have made and will make is always going to be independently financed.”


	Throughout his behind-the-camera career, Reiner continued as a working actor. He played the well-intentioned plastic surgeon Dr. Morris Packman, who affectionately spars with Goldie Hawn, in The First Wives Club (1996); Tom Hanks' pal in Ephron's Sleepless in Seattle (1993); the father of Zooey Deschanel on the 2011-18 Fox sitcom New Girl; and restaurant consultant Albert Schnurr on Hulu's The Bear this year.


	He was particularly memorable in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) as stockbroker Max Belfort in scenes with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill that were largely improvised.


	Reiner's sense of what worked onscreen was honed early on — first at home as the oldest child of comedy icon Carl Reiner and later around his dad's close friends, among them Sid Caesar, Neil Simon, Mel Brooks and the most influential of all, Norman Lear, the TV auteur whose 1970s activist comedies All in the Family, The Jeffersons, Good Times and Maude sparked seismic shifts in popular culture. 


	“Norman was the first guy who recognized that I had any talent,” Reiner wrote for The Hollywood Reporter in the wake of Lear's 2023 death, noting that he viewed him as “a second father.”

	











	“It wasn't just that he hired me for All in the Family,” Reiner told American Masters in 2005. “It was that I saw, in how he conducted his life, that there was room to be an activist as well. That you could use your celebrity, your good fortune, to help make some change.”


	As the Hollywood scion forged his directing career, it was Lear who put up the money for Stand by Me (1986) and Reiner's other early films, including the John Cusack-Nicollette Sheridan romp The Sure Thing (1985), lauded for elevating the teen comedy genre. 


Stand by Me — regarded as among the finest of coming-of-age movies — marked Reiner's ascent into Hollywood's highest ranks, no longer just a sitcom actor or the genial ex-husband of a fellow TV comic, Penny Marshall, star of Laverne & Shirley. (Marshall too would go on to become a top Hollywood director.)


	Famed author-screenwriter Goldman, who penned the Misery screenplay, said Reiner became a success because his work is “funny, but not simpy.”


	“His films have a certain comedy style … a sweetness and toughness,” Goldman told The New York Times in 1987. “Stand by Me is not just about four kids coming of age before junior high school — they're going to see a corpse. If John Hughes had made Stand by Me — and I'm not knocking Hughes — they would have been searching for a convertible.”


	Stephen King, author of the 1982 novella The Body (on which Stand by Me was based) and the 1987 novel Misery, became one of Reiner's most-steadfast collaborators. 

	











	Among other King books turned into movies by Castle Rock — Reiner named the company for the fictional setting in many of the author's novels — were Shawshank, The Green Mile (1999)and Dolores Claiborne (1995).


	After several false starts, King finally agreed to develop Misery for the screen, but only if Reiner put “his name on it” as producer or director.


	“It was a very personal book to him,” Reiner told TCM in 2021. “It was all about himself as a writer and feeling trapped … And so he let us option the book for $1. In fact, I think we made seven Stephen King films, and each one of them we got an option for $1.” 


	The 1990 Kathy Bates-James Caan starrer remains one of Hollywood's finest horror pieces, with Bates winning an Oscar for her role as the obsessive fan Annie Wilkes, who tortures author Paul Sheldon (Caan) while holding him hostage in her remote cabin.


	“Rob had a fantastic crew of people — people he had worked with for years, just the creme de la creme,” Bates said of the Misery shoot in a 2020 interview with Vanity Fair. “I learned so much just hanging out [on set] and watching.”


	Bates, 42 years old at the time, had predominantly been a stage actress. At the Academy Awards, where she bested Meryl Streep, Joanne Woodward, Anjelica Huston and Julia Roberts, she thanked Reiner “for taking a chance on me.”


	Often the most memorable scenes in Reiner's filmography came from his comedies — notably Ryan's climactic moment in When Harry Met Sally in which she feigns an orgasm over lunch with Crystal's character at Katz's Deli.

	











	Yet it was Reiner's mother, Estelle Reiner, who landed the film's renowned punchline: “I'll have what she's having.”


	“I said to her, mom, the line you have is the last line in the scene, and if it doesn't pop and top everything that's come before it, I won't use it,” Reiner told the AFI in a joint interview with Ephron in 2009. “We'll shoot it but be prepared, it might have to be cut.


	“And she said, ‘I don't care, I just wanna spend the day with you and be with you on the set. I don't care if it's in the movie or not.'” 


	Robert Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947, one of three children of the former Estelle Lebost, an artist and set designer, and Carl Reiner, the comic and writer who got his start as an entertainer in the U.S. Army and then in Broadway musicals.


	The family lived just off Grand Concourse, across the street from Marshall and her brother, future writer-producer-director Garry Marshall. But it would be decades before Rob and Penny actually met — at the 1970 audition in Los Angeles for the roles of Mike and Gloria Stivik on All in the Family. (The role of Gloria, of course, would go to Sally Struthers.)


	As Carl's career gained steam (he would win 11 Emmys), the family moved to Bonnie Meadow Road in the bucolic New York suburb of New Rochelle. It was the very street where Reiner would set his landmark 1960s CBS sitcom The Dick Van Dyke Show, about a rising comedy writer, Rob Petrie, and his beautiful wife, Laura.

	











	“Basically he wrote his own life in The Dick Van Dyke Show,” Rob Reiner said of his father. “And my mother was Mary Tyler Moore.”


	Rob got his start as an apprentice at the Bucks County Playhouse in Pennsylvania and with small guest roles on such shows as That Girl, Room 222 and The Beverly Hillbillies. 


	After UCLA Film School in 1967, he was paired with another young comic, Steve Martin, as a writing team on CBS' The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. The two were barely out of their teens. 


	The All in the Family role, for which Reiner would win two Emmys, followed in 1971. Convinced the show's incendiary subject matter would be rejected by viewers, he initially viewed the gig as a stopgap to tide him over between writing gigs.


	When the sitcom became a hit (Reiner stayed for eight of its nine seasons), he continued writing anyway, penning four episodes of the show and co-writing (with Garry Marshall and Phil Mishkin) the first episode of ABC's Happy Days in 1974.


	As a filmmaker notably surrounding himself with many of the industry's top writers — Goldman, King, Sorkin, Ephron, Crystal — Reiner showcased their dialogue to everlasting effect.


The Princess Bride's “Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die”; Misery's “I'm your No. 1 fan”; A Few Good Men's “You can't handle the truth”; and When Harry Met Sally's “I'll have what she's having” (Crystal actually came up with that line) reigned in pop culture for decades.

	











	But as Penny Marshall would humorously point out, no matter how substantive their accomplishments, “For me, all they say is ‘Laverne,' and for Rob … it's ‘Meathead,'” she told the New Yorker in 2012. “We're stuck with it.”


	The couple performed together infrequently but did co-star in the well-received 1978 romantic comedy More Than Friends. The ABC telefilm, written by Reiner and Mishkin and directed by James Burrows, was something of a precursor to When Harry Met Sally, about childhood pals unsure if they should pursue love as adults.


	Reiner also made an appearance as “Sheldn” (no “o”), the fiancé of Penny's Myrna Turner, on Garry Marshall's ABC series The Odd Couple.


	Their 10-year marriage came to an end in 1981 — amid tension as Laverne & Shirley shot Marshall to superstardom while Reiner was quietly forging his post-sitcom film career.


	Upon Marshall's death in 2018, Reiner professed his admiration for her, tweeting “so sad about Penny.” He added, “I loved Penny. I grew up with her. She was born with a great gift. She was born with a funny bone and the instinct of how to use it. I was very lucky to have lived with her and her funny bone. I will miss her.”


	The couple were the parents of actress Tracy Reiner, born in 1964 to Marshall during a brief first marriage and adopted by Reiner soon after their 1971 wedding. 


	In 1989, Reiner married Michele Singer, a photographer whom he met on the set of When Harry Met Sally. He said she was the inspiration for the film's happily-ever-after script change. In 2020, she joined Reiner in running Castle Rock and produced films. 

	











	In addition to Nick, the couple had two other children, son Jake and daughter Romy.


	A lifelong political activist who with King was among the public figures to urge President Joe Biden to hand the 2024 re-election reins to Kamala Harris, Reiner rarely missed a week on social media, penning calls to action on a range of social justice issues for his millions of followers. 


	He was among Hollywood's most vigorous and constant voices opposing Donald Trump.


	Among his other causes, Reiner was the co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which fought to overturn California's ban on same-sex marriage. In the late-'90s, he and his father were activists for higher taxes on cigarettes — money that was earmarked for prenatal care.


	His advocacy was often part of his writing and filmmaking, from his earliest days with the Smothers brothers to LBJ (2016) and Shock and Awe (2017), about journalists investigating the Bush administration's 2003 invasion of Iraq.


	Reiner was often a Hollywood peacemaker, well known for putting actors and crew at ease. When Bates and Caan clashed early in the production of Misery (she liked rehearsing; he preferred winging it), Reiner brokered a wary peace while using the tension to elicit superb performances. 


	“I want everyone around me to feel comfortable and happy,” he told The Guardian in 2018. “People only act up out of insecurity, and when they make it difficult, I just say, ‘We're playing make-believe here — enjoy yourself!'”

The legendary filmmaker's entertainment industry career spanned seven decades. 


							By 

	Abid Rahman


International Editor, Digital


	Filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead on Sunday at their Brentwood. The news has shocked Hollywood to the core, as not only was Reiner a popular and respected figure with a long career of success, he was also behind some of the greatest American films ever made, particularly in the comedy and rom-com genres.


	Though he rose to prominence as an actor in Norman Lear's 1970s situation comedy All in the Family, Reiner transitioned into directing in the 1980s and unarguably achieved greater success. Reiner's opening seven-film run of This Is Spinal Tap (1984), The Sure Thing (1985), Stand By Me (1986), The Princess Bride (1987), When Harry Met Sally (1989), Misery (1990) and A Few Good Men (1992) is regularly cited on social media among film fans and critics as one of the greatest hot streaks enjoyed by any director working in Hollywood.

					Hollywood Reacts In Shock Over Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Deaths: ""Legend Isn't a Big Enough Word""		
			









	His first film was the mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, which follows the misadventures of fictional British rock band Spinal Tap — played by Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer — on a disastrous tour of the U.S. in support of their new album, Smell the Glove. In the “doc,” Reiner also plays director Marty Di Bergi, who interviews the band as things go from bad to worse. The film is credited with launching the mockumentary genre and is regarded as one of the greatest comedies ever made, and several phrases from the film — such as putting things “up to eleven” — still permeate pop culture.

	











This Is Spinal Tap spawned a thousand imitators, was referenced to oblivion in other art and also led to a Reiner-directed sequel in 2025, Spinal Tap II: The End Continues. 


	Flush from the critical success of This Is Spinal Tap in 1984, Reiner directed the romantic road movie The Sure Thing, starring rising actors John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga, which was released a year later. The film told the story of two college students traveling across country over the Christmas holidays. Sure Thing was a critical and financial success and was praised for applying the traditional rom-com format to a film involving teenagers in an age when films like Porky's were far more pervasive and influential.


	Reiner's streak continued in 1986 with Stand by Me, the feature adaptation of Stephen King's novella The Body. The film, which starred rising actors Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell, told the story of four boys in 1959 Maine who decide to look for the dead body of a missing boy. The film, which was a big hit with critics and was a huge success at the box office, earned an Academy Award nomination for best adapted screenplay and secured Reiner his first Golden Globe nomination for best director. Since its release, Stand by Me has endured as a classic and like This Is Spinal Tap has been referenced in other popular films and TV series.


	In 1987, Reiner again struck gold with the fantasy comedy The Princess Bride, another film that has seemingly only become more popular over time and that has had a lasting legacy on pop culture. The movie, an adaptation of William Goldman's book The Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure, The “Good Parts” Version, featured an ensemble cast of actors and comedians including Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Chris Sarandon, Christopher Guest, Wallace Shawn, Peter Falk, a very young Fred Savage and Billy Crystal, as well as the wrestler André the Giant in a hugely memorable role as Fezzik. Once again, Reiner's film was responsible for a number of phrases to enter the lexicon, including Patinkin's Inigo Montoya's line “Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die” and Shawn's Vizzini's “Inconceivable!” and Elwes' Westley's “As you wish.”

	











	By now a dominant force in Hollywood, Reiner's purple patch continued in 1989 with When Harry Met Sally, a film that is widely considered one of Hollywood's greatest rom-coms. Written by Nora Ephron and starring Meg Ryan, Billy Crystal, Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby, When Harry Met Sally tells the story of Harry (Crystal) and Sally (Ryan) and their friendship, which evolves from platonic to something more over the span of 12 years. A massive success, the film made $92.8 million at the box office and Ephron was nominated for an Oscar for her script. When Harry Met Sally also became a pop culture phenomenon. Most notably, the fake orgasm scene that was shot in New York's Katz Deli made the food spot a popular tourist attraction.


	Reiner returned to Stephen King for inspiration for his 1990 movie Misery, adapting the author's 1987 novel of the same name. Misery starred James Caan as a famous writer who is held captive by a crazed fan played by an incredible Kathy Bates, a performance that would win her a well-deserved Academy Award for best actress.


A Few Good Men would bookend what many regard as Reiner's unprecedented opening run as a director. Released in 1992, the film was another adaptation of a popular book, this time John Grisham's military court legal drama. A Few Good Men starred Tom Cruise as a fresh-faced JAG Corps lawyer going up against a terrifying Jack Nicholson playing a USMC colonel responsible for the U.S. Navy's Guantánamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. Elevating the courtroom scenes, Reiner helped Nicholson to one of his career best performances and the film was nominated for four Oscars, including best picture and best supporting actor for Nicholson. 

	











	In the 1990s, 2000s and beyond, Reiner became more involved in politics, so much so he became one of the most prominent Hollywood liberals in the public conscience, and he was parodied as such in South Park. His film work in this period was still prolific but didn't meet with the same critical praise as his early features, still the filmmaker was able to produce a few gems, including the Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman-led buddy comedy The Bucket List in 2007. The film followed two terminally ill friends checking off things they've always wanted to do before they died. Though it received a lukewarm reception from critics, The Bucket List made a stellar $175 million at the global box office, and in keeping with Reiner's uncanny ability to penetrate the zeitgeist, the movie popularized the concept of the “bucket list.”

Co-written by the younger Reiner, 'Being Charlie' premiered at TIFF in 2015. It serves as an unexpected map of the Reiners' dynamic.


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	Nick Reiner has been arrested in connection with the homicide investigation into the deaths of his parents, Rob and Michele Reiner.


	It is not the first time that tension between the son and his parents has come into the public eye. Ten years ago, Rob and Nick actually made a movie about the challenges the Reiners faced.




	The younger Reiner had long struggled with addiction. The family's 2015 film drama, Being Charlie, documented the resultant struggles. Nick co-wrote the script with a friend from rehab, inspired by their experiences, while Rob directed the movie, drawing off what he went through as a father. Sanctioned by the family, the movie offers an unusually candid glimpse into the inner workings of the Reiner household in those years when Nick's challenges grew. Cary Elwes played the Rob stand-in and Nick Robinson the Nick Reiner character.

	Premiering at TIFF in September 2015 ahead of a release the next year on Starz, Charlie centers on Charlie Mills, the 18-year-old addict son of David , a movie star who is now running for Congress. Charlie resents the harsh way his father and mother are treating his addiction, which involves mandatory stints in rehab; that tracks closely with how Rob, Michele and Nick Reiner interacted, the family said.

	











	The movie offers few answers. And it ends with at best a détente after an apology from the dad for the sometimes-unsympathetic way he treated his son — an apology Reiner said in an interview at TIFF that he owed and gave to his son in real life.


	“When Nick would tell us that it wasn't working for him, we wouldn't listen. We were desperate and because the people had diplomas on their wall, we listened to them when we should have been listening to our son,” the Princess Bride director told the L.A. Times at a dinner with his family, including Nick, who by then achieved sobriety.


	Michele added: “We were so influenced by these people. They would tell us he's a liar, that he was trying to manipulate us. And we believed them.”


	Nick, who didn't say much at the dinner, did note that he decided to get clean because “I got sick of it. I got sick of doing that shit. I come from a nice family. I'm not supposed to be out there on the streets and in homeless shelters doing all these fucked-up things.” (The Hollywood Reporter's review said the pair “clearly used this as a way to work through how 22-year-old Nick Reiner's own drug problems affected their family.”)


	In a post-screening Q&A, Rob said that “we didn't set out for it to be cathartic or for it to be therapeutic, but it turned out to be that,” when asked by a festgoer about their relationship. Nick did not respond to that question. A moment later Rob said “there were disagreements” and “at times it was really rough” when the pair were trying to figure out how to depict the reality of their relationship in the movie. Nick said, “Sometimes it would get overwhelming for me.”

	











	The movie is on YouTube, and late Sunday night it had become a go-to space for people to come and debate how parents relate to their drug-addicted kids, with viewers alternately expressing sympathy for the father and the son. A film scene in which Charlie angrily confronts his father at his family home is painful to watch, and if law enforcement concludes Nick is the suspect, it would not be surprising if YouTube decided to remove the film.


Rob Reiner said that, at the time of production, his relationship with Nick had changed for the better. “To be honest, by the time we got to the point of making the movie…our relationship had gotten so much closer.”


	Still, Nick did not seem as engaged with the interview as one might have expected; at one point he said, “I really wasn't sure I wanted to do this.” A reporter came away feeling that the elder Reiner's expression of closure was an aspiration that had not been fully achieved.


	(THR's review concluded that the film featured “two warring agendas, aligned neatly with the father and son positions expressed therein. The son/addict side wants…to point out that recovery is a long, grinding process that never magically ends. The dad viewpoint, on the other hand, is all about seeking closure, making everything all better and moving on to some elusive next stage where life can resume as normal once a handily cathartic rock-bottom has been endured. But the two angles are not so easily reconciled by final-reel hugs and glib one-liners.”)

	











	The movie includes several scenes that would make uncomfortable any viewer who read the People.com report.


	This piece of dialogue comes near the end of the movie:


	David: “Charlie, I know you're angry at me and probably don't want to hear this right now but I do love you. I'm sorry. Every expert with a desk and a diploma told me I had to be tough at you but every time we sent you away to another one of those programs I saw you slipping away from us. And all I could tell myself is that I'd rather have you alive and hating me than dead on the streets. So what do you want me to do? Tell me what to do.”


	Charlie: “You don't have to do anything.”


	David: “You want to come up to Sacramento? Get away from all the—”


	Charlie: “—What, the drugs? It was never about the drugs. All I ever wanted was a way to kill the noise. But the more I used the louder it got.”


	David: “I was part of the noise, wasn't I?”


	Charlie motions a sarcastic “little bit.”


	David: “So what are you going to do?”


	Charlie: “I don't know. I'll figure it out [Pause.] I don't hate you.”


	David: “I know.”


	The two hug, as Charlie turns to walk out the door.


	David: “You take good care of yourself.”

Here is a recap of Billboard Boxscore's top 10 K-pop tours of 2025, featuring j-hope, LE SSERAFIM and more. 


													By
												

	Eric Frankenberg



Billboard revealed its year-end Boxscore charts beginning in December, ranking the top tours, venues and promoters of 2025. We're breaking it down further, looking at the biggest live acts, genre by genre. And on Monday (Dec. 15), we continue with K-pop.


	Simply put, K-pop has never been stronger on tour than it is right now. The genre represents 7.7% of the year's top-100 tour grosses, surpassing 5.1% in 2023 and 4% in 2019. It's worth noting that in 2019, BTS was No. 3 on the all-genre Top Tours chart, and was the only Korean act on that year's list. This year, absent of one such goliath, K-pop takes up a record-high eight spots in the top 100, doubling last year's count.


	From top to bottom, K-pop's top 10 artists are up from last year. Last year's No. 10 act, iTZY, reported $6 million in grosses. This year, the bar has been raised, threefold. The top 10 is rounded out by aespa with $18 million, bookended by two boy-groups who grossed more than $100 million each.


	As always, K-pop's year-end leaderboard is dominated by idol groups. Still, three soloists crack the top 10. Two of them come from BTS, as j-hope and Jin make impact with their first solo headline tours. Plus, genre legend G-Dragon brought in $27 million from just nine reported shows.


	Keep reading to check out the 10 highest grossing tours by K-pop acts, according to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore. All reported shows worldwide between Oct. 1, 2024, and Sept. 30, 2025, are eligible.

This is partner content.


	Billboard News, presented by Amazon Prime, breaks down notable highlights from Billboard's Greatest of All Time Holiday 100 Songs, including fan favorites from Katy Perry, Jonas Brothers and Wham!, to name a few. With festive sound cues and seasonal flair, the segment celebrates seasonal favorites and spotlights chart-topping moments, including Mariah Carey's continued reign with “All I Want for Christmas Is You.”


	Tetris Kelly: Yes, it's that time of year, and everybody's playlist is full of holiday bops. Well, if you need suggestions, we're breaking down some of the songs on Billboard‘s Greatest of All Time, Holiday 100 Songs presented by Amazon Prime. Getting cozy down in No. 79 is a holiday favorite by Katy Perry. 


	Katy Perry: Well, you know, I guess if this was the tester, it went well. I love this song, and I created it especially for Amazon. 


	Tetris Kelly: And the boy bands are represented with the Jonas Brothers at No. 70, NSYNC* at 64 and Jackson 5 at 42.

	Detectives with the Robbery Homicide Division were investigating an “apparent homicide” at Reiner's home, said Capt. Mike Bland with the Los Angeles Police Department. 


	Authorities have not confirmed the identities of the people found dead at the residence in the upscale Brentwood neighborhood on the city's west side that's home to many celebrities.


	Reiner is long one of the most prolific directors in Hollywood, and his work includes some of the most memorable movies of the 1980s and '90s, including “This is Spinal Tap,” “A Few Good Men,” “When Harry Met Sally” and “The Princess Bride.”


	His role as Meathead in the 1970s TV classic “All in the Family” alongside Carol O'Connor's Archie Bunker catapulted him to fame. Reiner turned 78 in March.


	Messages to his representatives were not immediately returned Sunday night.


	The son of comedy legend Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner has been married to photographer Michele Singer Reiner since 1989. The two met while he was directing “When Harry Met Sally” and have three children together.

	











	Reiner was previously married to actor-director Penny Marshall from 1971 to 1981. He adopted her daughter, Tracy Reiner. Carl Reiner died in 2020 at age 98 and Marshall died in 2018.

""It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner,"" a spokesperson for the family said.


													By
												

	Jessica Lynch



Rob Reiner, the acclaimed director, actor and producer whose work helped define modern American film and television comedy, has died alongside his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, it was confirmed late Sunday (Dec. 14). 


	A spokesperson for the Reiner family confirmed the deaths Sunday evening. “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.” 

	











	Emergency responders from the Los Angeles Fire Department arrived around 3:30-3:40 p.m. PT to the Chadbourne Avenue property following a medical aid call, discovering a 78-year-old man and a 68-year-old woman deceased with stab wounds. 


	The LAPD's Robbery-Homicide Division is investigating, with no suspect identified or detained as of Sunday evening; no signs of forced entry were reported




	“We are not looking for anyone as a suspect or in any other manner right now,” Hamilton said, adding that police will not release further details until the Los Angeles County coroner completes formal identification and investigators gather additional evidence.


	Reiner, who turned 78 in March, was one of Hollywood's most influential creative figures. He first rose to prominence in the 1970s as Mike “Meathead” Stivic on All in the Family, earning two Emmy Awards, before becoming a defining filmmaker of the 1980s and '90s. 


	His directing credits include This Is Spinal Tap, Stand by Me, The Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally…, Misery and A Few Good Men.


	In September, Reiner spoke with Billboard about the enduring legacy of This Is Spinal Tap ahead of the release of its long-awaited sequel, Spinal Tap II, reflecting on how closely the original film mirrored real rock culture.


	“Life imitating art imitating life,” Reiner said during the September interview, appearing on Zoom wearing a Spinal Tap baseball cap and T-shirt. “In Oasis' case, they're real brothers, but with Spinal Tap, the two guys were best friends since they were little and break apart and come back together.”


	Discussing the emotional core of the sequel, Reiner said the film leaned beyond satire. “The emotional ballast of the movie is the relationship between the two guys,” he said. “Now, many years later, they're older. The same issues are happening, but it's deeper because they've known each other longer.”


	Originally released in 1984, This Is Spinal Tap was not a box office success but became a cult classic through home video and word of mouth, particularly among musicians. Reiner previously noted that some rock stars initially bristled at how closely the film mirrored reality.

	











	“We took [moments] from the real world of rock and roll,” he said, citing backstage mishaps and infamous tour lore that later became part of music mythology.


	The son of comedy legend Carl Reiner, who died in 2020, Rob Reiner married photographer Michele Singer Reiner in 1989 after meeting while he was directing When Harry Met Sally…. The couple shared three children. Reiner was previously married to actor and filmmaker Penny Marshall, who died in 2018.




	Tributes continued to emerge Sunday night, including from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who described Reiner as “an iconic figure in film who made us laugh, cry and think.”


	Police said the investigation remains active and that additional updates will be provided as appropriate.

NY & Broadway Editor


Whoopi Goldberg gave an emotional tribute to her late friend and Ghosts of Mississippi director Rob Reiner on today's episode of The View, and followed it with an outraged response to Donald Trump‘s self-serving statement that the slain Hollywood icon died as a result of “his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump.”


	“Rob became a star in the iconic sitcom All In The Family,” an emotional Goldberg said, “and went on to direct beloved movies like This Is Spinal Tap, The Princess Bride, A Few Good Men, When Harry Met Sally, and I was lucky enough to get directed by him in Ghosts of Mississippi. He was also an outspoken activist and quite a guy, quite an amazing man.”

	











	Reiner and wife Michele Reiner were found dead yesterday afternoon in their Brentwood home, their stabbed multiple times. Nick Reiner, the Reiners' 32-year-old son, has been arrested and was book this morning in connection with the death of his parents.




			Watch on Deadline		







	After also mentioning the shootings at Australia's Bondi Beach and Brown University, Goldberg said, “I don't know how to process this…I don't even have the words, I don't know what to say.”


	When co-host Sunny Hostin started to mention Trump's Truth Social tweet, Goldberg gently stopped her and said, “Don't read it, just tell them that it's there.”


	Co-host Ana Navarro didn't hold back, growing angry as she said about Reiner. “At a time when so many in the media industry, so many with a platform are afraid to speak, he put his money and his mouth where his heart was and for Trump to have put that out today, I'm gonna say it: You know, damn it, there's an American family grieving. This is a tragedy, not just for the family, but for all who knew and loved him, and for the President of the United States to make this about him as a way to attack Rob Reiner, because he exercised his American right to speak up with what he disagreed with, is shameful. It is disgraceful. And of all the disgusting things that Donald Trump has done, this is right up there.”

	











	After the co-hosts discussed the Reiners' deaths and the two mass shootings, Goldberg said, “If we can wrap our minds around the awfulness of these things, then we can open our hearts to all the people who've had to deal with this. All the women, all the men, all the people of color, all the Jews, all the folks who've had to deal with this struggle. I don't understand the man in that White House, because he talked so much about Charlie Kirk and caring, and suddenly this is what he puts out. Have you no shame? No shame at all? Can you get any lower? I don't think so.”


	Goldberg, who said she last saw Reiner at the 2023 Kennedy Center Honors celebrating mutual friend Billy Crystal, ended the segment with, “Our hearts are breaking through all of this, through Rob, through what's happened at Bondi Beach, what happened at Brown and you don't find the time to say, as Americans, we hate what's happening. You ain't my president.”

Nick Reiner, the 32-year-old son of Rob Reiner and Michele Reiner, was arrested late Sunday and booked in the early morning hours of Monday in connection with the death of his parents.


	“This is proceeding as a murder investigation. We're putting together a timeline,” a law enforcement source told Deadline this morning.


	The Oscar-nominated Rob Reiner and his wife were found dead yesterday afternoon in their Brentwood home; both bodies were discovered with multiple stab wounds, according to law enforcement sources. Police had been investigating the crime throughout the night, but other than confirming they had been interviewing family members had few details to provide in an evening press conference Sunday and didn't even confirm the victims' names.

	











	According to Los Angeles Sheriff's Department records, Nick Reiner was booked at 5:04 a.m. PT this morning. Bail has been set at $4 million. The Los Angeles Police Department had no comment on the arrest, but will be providing an update on the investigation later this morning, we're told.

	Nick Reiner, 32, is one of Rob and Michele Reiner's three children. He has been open about his struggles with addiction. The 2015 film Being Charlie, co-written by Nick and directed by his father Rob, was loosely based on Nick's experience with addiction.


	According to sources, Nick had recently moved back into his parents' home.


	The Los Angeles Fire Department received an urgent call of an “incident” at the Reiner home, located on the 200 block of South Chadbourne Avenue, at about 3:38 p.m. PT Sunday. Authorities described the situation as a “family incident.”


	Well-placed sources told Deadline that authorities were summoned by one of the Reiner children, believed to be daughter Romy Reiner, who lives in the neighborhood, and another individual. it was the actually the other person who made the 911 call. 


	Last night, the family confirmed the death, saying, “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.”

	











	Reiner, who rose to fame playing Archie Bunker's son-in-law on All In the Family, became a prolific director and producer, with helming credits including This is Spinal Tap, Stand by Me, The Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally, Misery, A Few Good Men (for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture), The American President and Flipped among others.

I've read about Nick's troubles, but I hope Rob Reiner's son isn't being railroaded. Everyone wants closure, but we should make sure that doesn't mean jailing an innocent man.

The photo at the top of this article says it all. Look at the distance between these two men. You could see something was amiss. So sad.

It takes a truly sad mind to assume they can interpret what happened in 2025 based on a file photo from 2016. No one needed to read your detective work!

A history of documented trauma in his son and body language seen in photos are indicators – which forensic psychologists would evaluate – as indirect but suggestive evidence of a deeper issue working underneath the surface. Spatial relationships are part of the human experience and shouldn't be ruled out when reconstructing historical relationships and their dynamics contributing to a very unfortunate outcome.

Oh man, what a horrific tragedy

Throw away the key.

Yes. Unfortunately, but yes.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


UPDATED: As figures including Barack Obama, Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom shared their tributes to Rob Reiner, it was a reminder that the director-actor's impact on politics went beyond fund raising and celebrity endorsement.


	Over several decades, Reiner led efforts to pass an early childhood development initiative in California, and he later helped spearhead a drive to overturn the state's Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in the state. Ever outspoken in speeches and on social media, he more recently organized to challenge the Trump administration and produced God and Country, which chronicled the emergence of Christian nationalism.

	











	Reiner and his wife, Michele, were found dead on Sunday at their Brentwood home. Sources told Deadline that they had been stabbed. Their son Nick, 32, has been arrested and booked early Monday.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Obama said in a statement that Reiner “gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen. But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people — and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action. Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired.”


	After a remarkable run of box office and critical successes, Reiner turned to politics with The American President, a 1995 release starring Michael Douglas and Annette Bening. With a screenplay from Aaron Sorkin, the movie helped shape the latter's The West Wing, which stands out as an idealized view of the political process.

	











	The movie, Reiner said at a WBEZ Chicago retrospective in September, “celebrates what a presidency is all about and what a good president is all about.”


	He recalled that two issues were at the center of the movie, gun control and the environment. At the time, President Bill Clinton was running for re-election, and during on of his rallies, “he starts talking about a 20% reduction in fossil fuel emissions over the next 10 years. And then his handlers said, ‘What are you talking about? We haven't talked about that.' He said, ‘But I saw this film. That's a good idea. I like that idea.'”


	In 1998, Reiner championed Proposition 10, a ballot initiative to put a 50 cent tax on cigarettes to go to fund early child development via education, health services and childcare. Reiner hired as his political adviser Chad Griffin, a young staffer in the Clinton White House who had been a liaison on The American President.


	Reiner's success with the initiative helped generate speculation that he himself would make the plunge into politics, perhaps for a run as governor of California. That never happened, but Reiner became an active voice in campaigns and the state and federal level. He campaigned with Howard Dean in his 2004 presidential run, and held and hosted events for Hillary Clinton for her 2008 bid, later endorsing Obama when he won the nomination.


	In 2008, in the aftermath of California voters' passage of Proposition 8 in 2008, banning same-sex marriage in the state, Reiner, his wife Michele, and Griffin and Kristina Schake had been dining at the Beverly Hills Hotel. A chance meeting with one of the Reiners' acquaintances led them to contact Ted Olson, the conservative lawyer who had represented George W. Bush in the 2000 presidential recount challenge in the Supreme Court. Olson ended up joining with his counterpart in the recount, David Boies, in a federal court challenge of Proposition 8, spearheaded by Griffin and Reiner, who formed the group the American Foundation for Equal Rights to fund and promote the case.


	At the time, there was some discord in the LGBTQ community that such an approach was the right legal strategy, given the uncertainty and fear that a conservative-leaning Supreme Court would ultimately render a decision with an adverse precedent.


	But Reiner and other backers were not dissuaded, insisting that such foundational rights were too important to let stand. The lawsuit led to a first-of-its-kind trial in 2010 on the constitutional right to same-sex marriage, with plaintiff couples Jeff Zarrillo and Paul Katami, and Sandy Stier and Kris Perry testifying. 


	They won a landmark district court ruling and later at the appellate level, before the case made its way to the Supreme Court. The high court ruled in 2013 that the defenders of Proposition 8 lacked standing to bring the case, after California's governors, Arnold Schwarzenegger and then Jerry Brown, refused to back it. 


	At the same time, public opinion had shifted in favor of same-sex marriage, and further legal challenges from other groups brought the issue back to the Supreme Court in 2015. That led to the Obergefell vs. Hodges ruling that required that states recognize the marriages of same-sex couples.


	Reiner backed Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, trekking to the Democratic National Convention as she accepted the nomination. After Donald Trump's surprise victory, Reiner was a major Hollywood voice in opposition, while using his platform to try to highlight the influence of Russia on U.S. elections. In 2017, he and a number of scholars on the right and the left were part of a group, Committee to Investigate Russia, to provide a one-stop shop as investigations were in full swing.

	











	The Clintons said in a statement that the Reiners “inspired and uplifted millions through their work in film and television. And they were good, generous people who made everyone who knew them better through their active citizenship in defense of inclusive democracy, setting an example for us all to follow. Hilliary and I will always be grateful for their friendship, unfailing kindness, and support.”


	James Costos, the former U.S. ambassador to Spain and a political advocate, wrote in a Substack post, “Together, Rob and Michele were deeply engaged in political advocacy to protect and strengthen our democracy, encouraging civic participation, defending fundamental freedoms and standing up to forces that sought to divide us.”


	He added, “This loss is simply devastating, and my heart is with everyone who loved them.”


	With Trump back in the White House this year, Reiner continued to warn of the threat to American rule of law.


	Reiner told WBEZ in September, “It's really gotten to a very, very scary place in this country, and we're going to have to figure out how to dig ourselves out of this before it's too long. But we have got to keep speaking out. Everybody has to keep speaking out.”


	He added, “We've been the longest living democracy ever, and we certainly haven't done everything right. We've done a lot of things wrong, but we go in fits and starts to move in the right direction. There was a time a woman couldn't vote. There was a time Black person couldn't vote. There was a time a Black person couldn't marry a white person. There was a time where people of the same sex couldn't marry. We move forward. We move forward. But this is the biggest step backward I've ever seen, and I'm hoping it's not too big a step backward that we can't bounce back and jump forward.”

Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were stabbed to death in their LA home on Sunday and their son is a person of interest, law enforcement sources told The Post.

Officers were called to the home Sunday afternoon, where they discovered a man and woman with stab wounds, cops and sources told the outlet.

The couple's 32-year-old son and screenwriter Nick Reiner is a person of interest in the deadly stabbing, the sources added.

The Los Angeles Fire Department told local outlet NBC Los Angeles that a 78-year-old man and a 68-year-old woman were found dead inside the home, which match the ages of Rob and Michele.

A spokesperson for LAPD told The Post that detectives from LAPD's Robbery-Homicide Division were also at the scene. The robbery-homicide division is responsible for handling high-profile investigations across the city.

According to The Post, the street in front of the “Spinal Tap” directors home were blocked off and detectives could be seen going in and out of the residence.

The LAFD paramedics rushed to the home around 3:40 p.m.

Shortly after, officers with the LAPD responded to the home following reports of an “ambulance death investigation,” which is when officers are called by firefighters to the discovery of a death.

“This is a devastating loss for our city and our country,” LA Mayor Karen Bass said Sunday night. “Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice.”

“Personally, I am heartbroken by the tragic loss of Rob and his wife Michele. I knew Rob and have tremendous respect for him. Among his numerous contributions, Rob helped create First 5 California, a landmark initiative funded by a tobacco tax to support early childhood development programs. He and Michele fought for early childhood development and marriage equality, working to overturn Proposition 8. They were true champions for LGBTQ+ rights,” Bass added.

People magazine reported Sunday that their daughter Romy found them.

The couple, who were last seen together in April, wed in 1989 and share three children: Jake, Nick and Romy. Reiner also shares an adopted daughter with his late ex-wife, Penny Marshall.

Their son Nick has been open about his issues battling drug addiction and homelessness in the past.

“I was homeless in Maine. I was homeless in New Jersey. I was homeless in Texas I spent nights on the street. I spent weeks on the street. It was not fun,” he told People in an interview in 2016.

Reiner — the son of comedian Carl Reiner, who passed away in 2020 — was born in in 1947 in the Bronx, NY.

Reiner rose to fame in the 1970s for his Emmy-winning portrayal of Michael “Meathead” Stivic, Archie Bunker's son-in-law, in American classic TV show “All in the Family.” 

Reiner met Michele, a photographer, while working on the classic rom-com “When Harry Met Sally.”

Reiner directed beloved and classic films including “The Princess Bride,” “Stand By Me,” “Misery” and “Spinal Tap.”

Singer Trey Songz was arrested for assault after allegedly punching a New York nightclub employee in the face earlier this month.

Songz and his friends were partying at Dramma Night Club in Times Square on Dec. 4 and allegedly “became needlessly irate” when a worker told him the club was closing around 4 a.m., prosecutors said in Manhattan criminal court, according to The Post.

Prosecutors claim the 41-year-old punched the worker in the face, causing “swelling and substantial pain.”

Songz appeared in court Sunday as he was arraigned on an assault charge for the alleged club brawl and an additional charge of mischief in the second degree from an unrelated incident that took place Sunday morning at Mira, a restaurant and hookah lounge in Manhattan.

During the Sunday incident, Songz allegedly broke around $1,500 worth of restaurant property, including hookahs, DJ equipment and sofas, according the complaint against him.

The employee from Dramma was granted an order of protection against Songz, who is a regular at the nightclub, according to prosecutors.

The songwriter, born Tremaine Neverson, left court wearing a hood covering his face and declined to comment.

He was granted supervised release as the judge noted his history of run-ins with the law made him a risk and is due back in court Feb. 18, per The Post.

In a statement from Songz's counsel, Page Six is told that the singer “was charged in connection with an incident that occurred last week. He is cooperating fully and looks forward to the facts coming to light.”

“Separately, last night Trey was confronted by individuals who instigated a confrontation and attempted to surround him. His security intervened to protect him and contain the situation, and an altercation occurred in the ensuing confusion,” the statement continued. 

“Public figures are often treated as targets for instigation in pursuit of headlines or financial gain. We are confident the facts will speak for themselves.”

In 2016, the “Na Na” hitmaker was arrested and charged with assault after an onstage meltdown in which he threw microphones and speakers from the stage of his Detroit concert.

Subsequently, the R&B artist took a plea deal on two counts of disturbing the peace and served 18 months of probation.

In 2018, a woman accused Songz of striking her in the face during an NBA All-Star event and obtained a restraining order against him.

That same month, he was arrested on felony assault charges, though all charges against him were ultimately dropped. 

But in January 2021, he was arrested again after a wild caught-on-camera brawl with a cop at a =Kansas City Chiefs game.

After being released from jail, the “Bottoms Up” crooner poked fun at the incident, posting a series of photos on a private jet to social media and quipped, “Chiefs game was lit right?!”

That same year, he was subject to a sexual assault investigation after former Las Vegas basketball player Dylan Gonzalez accused the singer of raping her. 

Songz denied all of her claims and was cleared of all allegations by April 2022 due to lack of evidence.

He was accused of more incidents of sexual assault in February 2022 in a $20 million lawsuit, including “brutal” rape. A confidential settlement was reached back in September. 

In the latest lawsuit against him, the musician was sued for sexual assault after a woman alleged he groped her breasts during an incident in 2013.

In documents obtained by Page Six, Jane Doe claimed that Songz “came up behind” her, and she was “shocked” to see that he allegedly “ripped back her bathing suit top, grabbed her breasts, and exposed them” to those inside of the tent, per the lawsuit.

That lawsuit is still pending as his team continues to file motions to dismiss Doe's complaint.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","IT: Welcome To Derry drowns its finale's promise under tons of franchise business","https://www.avclub.com/it-welcome-to-derry-season-1-finale-recap-winter-fire","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 04:10:00 GMT","

The only reasonable way I can think to approach “Winter Fire,” the season-one finale of IT: Welcome To Derry—sorry, that's IT: Welcome To Derry: Chapter One, as the show loudly trumpets in its closing minutes—is the same way I'd try to come to terms with any particularly tough and gristly piece of meat. That is, hack away as much of the inedible and unpalatable connective tissue as you can in the hopes of finding something flavorful and nourishing underneath. So let's reach for the cleaver, huh? 

Because, make no mistake about it, this finale is one of the more ungainly “I told you that story so I could tell you this story, probably some time in Q4 2027” episodes of TV I've encountered in a good long time. (And that's from both directions, actually, courtesy of a post-ending sequence that jumps forward to 1988 in a bald effort to justify this season's Mrs. Kersh plotline, while also working in a quick Sophia Lillis cameo.) Lillis' appearance dovetails nicely with the flash of Finn Wolfhard we got a bit earlier in the finale, when poor Pennywise The Dancing Clown is forced to lay epic amounts of track for potential prequel/sequel purposes when he reveals that his current opponent Margie Truman will eventually get married and give birth to IT's co-killer, Richie Tozier. IT knows this, it tells us entirely unprompted, because it views time in a non-linear fashion. Margie and Lilly later saying this nice and slow, so everybody in the back can get it, means that this show can now justify launching a pre-prequel for itself by following the creature's attempts to wipe out the bloodlines that lead to its downfall through time. The fact that this makes no goddamn sense in the context of anything that happened in either IT film, the other flashbacks we've gotten of Pennywise before, or the character's basic behavior even in this specific episode doesn't really matter. The important thing is that the show's apparently inevitable next season has now been “narratively justified,” and it only took grinding this one to a halt to get it done.

If there's an elegant way to impart this information, Jason Fuchs' script and Andy Muschietti's camera never find it—but that's not a problem unique to those parts of “Winter Fire” dedicated to the show's wider franchise duties. After all, it's just as inept at adding even a single layer of naturality to the way the plotting here shoves all of our board-game pieces frenetically into place, so the show can have something approaching a meaningful climax on the frozen shores of the Penobscot River. The sudden revelation that our old friend the Magic Dagger starts acting like the One Ring if it gets moved even a couple of miles away from where it landed in Derry—because that's its “home,” duh—at least has a bracing amount of narrative utility, allowing Fuchs to resolve Ronnie and Lilly's lingering conflict, layer in some last-second “power of friendship” material for the group, and pace out the final confrontation to be one of the slowest-moving cliffhangers I've ever seen, all with a single plot point. But I also have a certain soft spot for the more nakedly expositional bit where Kimberly Guerrero busts out charts and maps to provide an exact geographical finish line for the episode's final race, with Charlotte, Hank, and Leroy nodding along in plot-mandated comprehension as she explains that they have to get to the Magic Tree with the Magic Dagger before the monster clown can get across the river or everything will be lost.

Besides forcing Guerrero to deliver some lines that are just absolute video game fetch quest nonsense (“The earth is a conductor,” she intones with a matter-of-fact gravity I've come to think of in these pages as “Remar-esque”), there's a bigger problem that this hefty bit of last-second construction imposes: Making the end of this conflict so concrete highlights how fast and loose the show has played with IT's physical capabilities, which allow it to blanket all of Derry in icy fog at the start of the episode but then slow it to the speed of plot once the creature's making its escape. Bullets inconvenience IT, unless they don't; the Magic Dagger freezes it, unless the script needs that not to happen. To be clear, I'm not arguing that IT should have rules; its chimeric, unknowable nature is a huge part of what makes it scary. But by giving itself a very deliberate ticking clock for the creature to race against, “Winter Fire” invites these comparisons onto itself, creating situations where it makes what should be the show's single most valuable asset—one of the scariest creations of one of America's scariest brains, a monster designed to tap into our most primal fears, and one that had me, personally, scared shitless to reach my hand out into a darkened basement to feel for a light switch as a teenager for years—look either weak, foolish, or both. Tabletop game designers constantly caution dungeon masters not to stat out monsters and gods they don't want to see killed or humbled by ambitious players; this finale is an able demonstration of why.

Luckily, it's also a demonstration of some notable elements of Welcome To Derry's better nature, even if, as predicted, the show never finds a message more interesting and meaningful to cling to than “Friends and family: good! The military murdering people to impose fear on Americans: bad!” (R.I.P. General Shaw: You certainly died dumb.) When Muschietti isn't giving into his gorier impulses or trying to find more places to jam teeth into Bill Skarsgård's face, he's capable of a subtly horrifying visual here or there. I was especially taken with the bit where Pennywise calls the students of Derry High into an assembly, only to greet them with the puppeteered body of Principal Dunleavy. Seeing a grown man's body hanging limp and used as a ventriloquist dummy is the kind of genuinely spooky imagery this show could have used a lot more of. (It's a pity we have to get to the skull crushing and CGI light show so soon.)

It's in its character work, though—always this show's strongest element—that “Winter Fire” achieves some measure of saving grace. Whether watching Jovan Adepo's Leroy talk Chis Chalk's Hallorann out of suicide, or seeing Clara Stack and Amanda Christine sink their teeth into Lilly and Ronnie's frustrations with both themselves, and each other, this episode gets closest to thriving when it focuses on people, not plot. Even Skarsgård gets a chance to add a few more notes to Pennywise's emotional toolkit, projecting genuine confusion, and even a little fear, when Hallorann sucks the clown into a paralyzing fantasy that he's just a delusional Bob Gray. And fuck, I'm not made of stone: When Rich's ghost emerged from the fog to help slam the Magic Dagger home—tossing a middle finger the clown's way in the process—I got a giddy little thrill.

I can hold on to those highs, almost all emotional in nature, while contemplating this finale—as long as I don't start actually, y'know, thinking. Because that's when my brain starts complaining about how little almost anything IT does in this episode makes sense. Or the way Hallorann asks “How much trouble could a hotel be?” while the show takes a little bow at how goddamn clever it's being with its Shining references. Or thinking about the absolutely insane decision Charlotte and Leroy make at the end of the episode, choosing not to leave Derry so that they can join Rose's secret organization of IT watchers—something there was absolutely no evidence of in the films. (Y'know, the ones where the grandson they've doomed to live in this hell town is getting constantly threatened by a murder clown with absolutely zero oversight?) Or the way the entire climax takes place on a massive sheet of ice, but people only slip or slide when the narrative absolutely demands it? Some of these are big structural defects, and some of them are just nit-picks. But they add up to an episode of TV that works intermittently in the heart but almost never in the head.

And that's Welcome To Derry in a nutshell, really. It's a series you can either appreciate on a strict gut level of spectacle—although I'd argue that it's one of the least actually scary horror shows I've ever seen—or as a showcase of craft and performance. But as a cohesive story, it never came together, failing to grab hold of any major themes or ideas (beyond “murder clown scary,” I guess) or build anything satisfying beyond a handful of core character arcs. I come away from it unconvinced that Muschietti actually knows what was horrifying about Stephen King's book, or even what could have been scary about this era of American history. (Has a series so deliberately set up as a period show ever cared less about its own historical context?) A crew of talented performers, and some genuinely stomach-turning effects shots, have worked overtime to give the series an energy it otherwise might have failed to possess. (I can still get a latent thrill from that opening car ride in the pilot, or Ronnie's nightmare sequence in episode two, sequences that merged the visceral with the real in a way that mined both for genuine fear.) But a lot of that spark, if I'm being honest, seemed to desert the series once it had Skarsgård to fall back on for a more rote, if charismatic, flavor of menace. And if this is all Muschietti and his fellow writers and directors could think to do with this fantastic creation, in this rich an era of American history, then my vote is obvious after eight episodes of disappointed hopes: Down, I say, with the clown.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","I Love LA drops its best episode yet","https://www.avclub.com/i-love-la-recap-season-1-episode-7-divas-down","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 05:12:00 GMT","

For weeks, I've been making two (somewhat related) arguments about I Love LA: that it's a remarkably classic sitcom when you pare down its Gen Z sensibility, and that it's mostly been hampered by a sketch-like approach to its storylines. Enter “Divas Down,” which takes a page out of Friends (yes, you won't convince me otherwise!) and gives us the kind of stakes we needed in order to make Maia (Rachel Sennott) finally have to grapple with the (awful) person she's becoming.

Well, “becoming” is perhaps debatable. For if there's anything we've learned over the past seven episodes is that Maia and her friends are maybe not as nice as they all think they are. But nice, in their world (of likes and fame, connections and clout) doesn't get you far. The one person who is nice in the show is Dylan (Josh Hutcherson), who is, perhaps, starting to see his girlfriend in a new light. I mean, at the start of the episode when he's trying to put up a shelf up in their living room, he finds himself knowing by heart her little acerbic quips about L.A. (“I kind of hate the beach. It's like, sand is just dirt, and we're all pretending that it's not”) and rolling his eyes at her performative (and repetitive) brand of cynicism. 

Not that she notices. Maia is way too focused on Antoine (Tim Baltz), the organizer of the Formé dinner in New York City. Unlike Dylan, you may not know what that is, but to hear Maia and Alyssa (Leighton Meester) talk about it, it is the tastemaking event of Fashion Week. Getting Tallulah (Odessa A'zion) on the guest list is a must—for Maia. Alyssa is intent on pushing her own client, Camilia, for when Antoine visits the Alyssa 180 offices.

But when Antoine and his (gay, French, prissy) assistant show up, he's enthralled by the Ritz photo Alyssa put up: “She loves ze cracker,” he says. That's all Maia needs to jump in and hijack Antoine's chat with her boss, all while wearing the same top. “You are like a mini Alyssa,” he says. “It's like little nesting dolls.” It shows us once more how driven she can be—and give us a taste of the kind of manager she can be and why Alyssa should be worried about her.

It's settled: Tallulah will meet with Antoine to discuss the Formé dinner. You'd think Tallulah would be thrilled. Instead, the chill vibes of Mar Vista (and her girlfriend, Tessa) have clearly gotten to her. So she asks Maia if she can just skip it. After all, last time they rushed into something it was that flop of a Ritz campaign. But Maia wants Tallulah to understand how much more elevated this is: This would change their lives. It's why she needs Charlie (fresh off a hair transplant) to find her a killer outfit for it and meet her at Alani's, where she's trying to talk sense into her friend all while opening up all the many boxes of swag Tallulah's had delivered to Maia's apartment and which symbolize, in that moment (as she holds a knife) all the frustrations about how their friendship and their business dynamic is suddenly out of sync. 

Which brings us to the Friends moment—or what I'm insisting is the show's Friends moment. (Watch “The One With All The Thanksgivings” to know what I mean.) For the knife suddenly drops onto Maia's foot (!). It's a moment as shocking as it is hilarious. Because, career woman that she is, Maia is less concerned about the blood slowly pooling around the knife and more about what this'll mean for the Antoine meeting. 

Next thing we know, she's grabbing the knife out of her toe, poorly bandaging it and heading to Good Samaritan, the closest hospital to the Antoine meeting. Talk about having one's priorities all mixed up, right? 

The scene does offer my favorite shot of the episode, which helpfully illustrates the tension between Maia and Tallulah with not even an ounce of dialogue: As they arrive at the hospital, director Lorene Scafaria holds the shot from inside the car as we watch Maia haul herself onto the floor and then onto a wheelchair, while Tallulah is seen caressing and cooing at Tessa, not realizing how hard all of that is for her friend.

Soon, that tension is hard to avoid. It turns out there's been an accident (involving a school bus full of Orthodox Jews) that'll keep Maia from getting any kind of immediate treatment. This is unacceptable to her: They need to make the meeting. Everything is riding on it. Even if Tallulah remains quite disenchanted with it—and with Maia, in turn. Why won't her friend admit that Ritz was a flop? That Tallulah has every right to want to take a beat before they make a big move like this? Maybe this entire scenario is the universe telling Maia to chill. 

As the two besties dig in their heels, Maia does end up admitting that, yes, Ritz was a flop. But Formé is not: This is the dinner that put Cara Delevingne (and her unplucked eyebrows) on the map. Antoine can do that for Tallulah. But only if they can get out of this hospital soon. And, well, Maia is often mistaken for being Jewish. Why not use that to their advantage? Yep, who needs scruples at a time like this?

And so, our own Maia gets finally seen by a doctor who applies some anesthesia (on an open wound) and tells her he'll be back later when it finally kicks in so he can sew in the stitches she'll need. Like in last week's episode, this entire hospital sequence lets Sennott shine as a performer. She can't possibly wait that long, she says, and she can definitely handle the stitches without anesthesia. When, at the same time, she hears from Alyssa that Antoine has cancelled their meeting, Sennott gets to offer a welcome melody of variations on “OH MY GOD!” that's enough to guide her friends her way. (Why do they make hospital hallways all look the same?)

It all seems to have been for nought. Which is news to all of her friends: Alani, Charlie, and Tallulah can't believe their can-do, crazily driven friend (who just got stitches with no anesthesia!) is giving up. What's the plan? What's the move?

Courtney (Lauren Holt), whose Duolingo French classes helped her cozy up to Antoine's assistant, immediately informs Maia over the phone where Antoine is set to be, per his schedule. Sure, the doctor is recommending she stay there to recover but this is a manager who'll do anything for her client: “I need to get Tallulah to New York. Fuck the toe,” she says when learning she may get it infected and lose it altogether if she walks out.

As the girls, all decked up in Charlie-approved fits (Tallulah in a fab black see-through bra/thong number; Maia in a gorgeous cream dress) walk into the restaurant where Antoine is, they can't hide their shock: Alyssa is taking a meeting with him. (I keep showing my age, but god, I love a good Working Girl twist like that.)

And so the little nesting dolls face one another, realizing what had happened. But truly, once Antoine sees Tallulah, it's all over for Alyssa and Camilia. And when boss and protégé are left alone at the table once Antoine whisks Tallulah away, it's clear none of this will stand: Alyssa can't have her underling give her the runaround, and Maia can't possibly let herself be so blindsided. Alyssa fires Maia on the spot. It's the cherry on top of a truly fucked-up day.

What a relief then, to arrive home, in hopes of sharing it all with Dylan. Nice, dependable, Dylan. Only she's clearly forgotten that she was supposed to be there for dinner…with his parents. Yikes. That proves to be the final straw for Dylan, who is done making excuses for her and being the understanding boyfriend when she cannot even bring herself to call him when she's in the emergency room (surrounded by her friends) and getting stitches. 

It's a classic, “having it all” conundrum: She was doing what needed to be done for Tallulah, for her career, for the “big life” she wants for them both. But that, for us who have been paying attention, is not what Dylan needs: “The bigger your life is getting, the smaller I'm getting,” he says. And you truly feel for him, especially because you see how little care he's been getting from Maia (who can't even name one of his co-workers).

Rob Reiner passed away on December 14, 2025, leaving behind four children. Here's what we know about his eldest daughter, Tracy Reiner.

Although Tracy is Rob's first child, the two aren't biologically related. Reiner adopted Tracy when he married her mother, Penny Marshall. Marshall, an actress known for her work on “Laverne & Shirley” and “Big,” married the “Stand By Me” director in 1971. Tracy was only in elementary school when Reiner took her under his wing and raised her as his own. 

Marshall and Reiner were married for ten years before parting ways. Later, Reiner married Michele Singer, with whom he had three children, giving Tracy three half-siblings. Her mother, Marshall, passed away in 2018.

Tracy utilized her family connections to start her own acting career, taking on roles in various films directed by her parents. She played a test market researcher in “Big,” directed by her mother. She also held a role in her father's hit romantic comedy, “When Harry Met Sally.”

The film follows two friends who eventually recognize that they're in love with each other. Before they make that realization, though, they each date other people. One of the women Harry dates was played by Tracy, according to Business Insider. Although Tracy's role wasn't very big, her presence led Sally to note that Emily, her character, “is a little young for Harry.”

When her mother directed “A League of Their Own,” Tracy got her chance at a main role. She played Betty “Spaghetti” Horn, the left fielder for the film's main baseball team.

“A League of Their Own” and “Big” weren't the only times Tracy worked alongside Tom Hanks. The two acted in four movies together in total. They were both in “Apollo 13,” and Hanks directed Tracy in “That Thing You Do!”

According to an interview with Jeff Pearlman, Tracy began heading a team that funded and marketed a new medical software company in 2013. “I love lens history and projection as well as farm and water technologies and alternative energies,” Tracy said of her work.

Today, according to LinkedIn, Tracy is the president of the Women's Club of Hollywood, a role she's held since 2021.

Her father will surely be missed, and our hearts are with Tracy and her family during this difficult time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","VIDEO: See the Beautiful Home of Late Legend Rob Reiner","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/rob-reiner-brentwood-home-details-investigation/","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 04:45:38 GMT","

Legendary director Rob Reiner and his wife, photographer Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead inside their Brentwood home Sunday afternoon, according to TMZ. The couple died on Sunday, December 14, after first responders were called to the residence to provide medical aid and discovered them deceased. 

Multiple sources later confirmed to People that their son, Nick Reiner, was involved, as authorities continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding the loss that has shaken Hollywood.

NBC Los Angeles reported that two people, a man, 78, and a woman, 68, were found dead inside the Brentwood home owned by the actor and director. A significant police presence was seen at the property as news of the discovery spread, prompting public concern about the iconic filmmaker and his family.

Reiner's Brentwood mansion is located on Chadbourne Avenue in Los Angeles, near Sunset Boulevard. 

According to a 1991 Los Angeles Times report, Reiner and Michele purchased the home from Norman Lear, the legendary producer behind “All in the Family,” the sitcom that launched Reiner to fame as Michael “Meathead” Stivic.

Lear had owned theproperty since 1972 and initially listed it for $6.5 million. The sale ultimately closed for $4.75 million, the Times reported. 

The New England–style residence spans roughly 10,000 square feet and includes six bedrooms, six bathrooms, two staff quarters, and sits on just under an acre of land.

The property was described as featuring a swimming pool, pool pavilion, and landscaped gardens. A tennis court on a lot across the street was also reportedly included in the sale. 

Built in 1936, the home was once owned by Henry Fonda before being sold to actor Paul Henreid. During Lear's ownership, a screening room and guest suite were added.

Reiner was one of Hollywood's most influential directors, with a filmography that includes “This Is Spinal Tap,” “Stand by Me,” “The Princess Bride,” “When Harry Met Sally…,” “Misery,” and “A Few Good Men.” He first became a household name as Mike Stivic on “All in the Family,” which ran for nine seasons.

Born in the Bronx in 1947, Reiner was the son of comedy legend Carl Reiner and actress and singer Estelle Lebost. 

He met Michele while directing “When Harry Met Sally…,” and the couple married in 1989. They shared three children. Reiner also had a daughter from his previous marriage to Penny Marshall, who died in 2018.

Authorities have not released further details as the investigation remains ongoing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Mira Sorvino In Shock Over the Passing of 'Wonderful' Rob Reiner & His 'Generous' Wife: Posts Lengthy Tribute","https://entertainmentnow.com/dancing-with-the-stars/mira-sorvino-rob-reiner-tribute/","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 02:50:22 GMT","

Actress and former ‘Dancing with the Stars' contestant Mira Sorvino is honoring the late director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, in a beautiful statement posted online. The couple tragically passed away in their Los Angeles home on Sunday, December 14.

“I am in absolute shock,” wrote Sorvino in her Instagram post from December 15. 

She continued, “Rob Reiner was a legend and a kind, brilliant man, a wonderful actor to work opposite on Hollywood, an iconic director. His wife Michele was a lovely generous person- I wish I had been able to get to know her better.” 

“The world has lost two tremendous humans. He was so funny and intelligent – we had a great time shooting what could have been awkward scenes but his wit and warmth made all that go away. Talking with him on and off the set was a joy. This doesn't seem possible. My deepest sorrow and condolences and prayers go out to their family,” Sorvino concluded.

Sorvino and Reiner co-starred in Ryan Murphy's 2020 Netflix limited series “Hollywood,” a reimagining of Tinseltown. She played actress Jeanne Crandall and Reiner played studio head Ace Amberg. In the miniseries, their characters had an affair.

“I wanted to do something where I gave some, if not all of these people a happy ending,” Murphy told TIME. “How do I make a commentary on the power of Hollywood to change hearts and minds? I decided to put together a fictional alternative-universe Hollywood and then populated it with some real people, and other fictional characters loosely based on real people.”

Sorvino won the Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Woody Allen's “Mighty Aphrodite” (1995). She is also known for her roles in 1997's cult classic “Romy and Michele's High School Reunion,” where she starred opposite Lisa Kudrow. She has also been in genre films like “Mimic,” and television roles like “Norma Jean & Marilyn,” which earned her a Primetime Emmy Nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress and a Golden Globe Nomination for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film.

She also competed on “Dancing with the Stars” Season 32 in 2023 with her pro partner Gleb Savchenko. 

While on the show, she gave fans a throwback to “Romy and Michele's High School Reunion” when she performed a contemporary style dance to “Time After Time” by Cyndi Lauper. She brought her daughter Mattea out to make it a three-person dance, just as it is in the film.

They finished in 10th place.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Rob Reiner & Michele Singer Leave Son Jake Reiner Behind","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/rob-reiner-son-family-jake-reiner/","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 16:41:48 GMT","

Beloved filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer, have passed away. The tragic news was shared on December 14, when it was reported that their daughter had found them dead in their Brentwood, California home, People reports. Reiner was 78, and Singer was 68. 

The couple shares three children. Their oldest son is Jake Reiner, who was born in 1991. He also has two siblings: Nick, born in 1993, and Romy, born in 1997. The “When Harry Met Sally” director was also the father of actress Tracy Reiner. He adopted Tracy while married to her mother, actress Penny Marshall. Reiner and Marshall were married from 1971 until 1981. 

Jake followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in the entertainment industry. He is also an actor. He shared a close relationship with his father, and the pair gave a joint interview to People in 2023. In it, they discussed their love of baseball and how they regularly watched games together. 

This passion for the sport was started by Jake's grandfather, Carl Reiner. “My dad was a huge, huge baseball fan. He passed it onto me, and I passed it onto Jake,” Robert told People. Jake also weighed in, saying, “My dad and I talk daily about the Dodgers,” Jake said. “I've got a lot of opinions, and so does he.”

They shared many special memories, including a trip to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. “We sat down in this theater there and they start showing the history of when Black players first came into the league. I'm sitting there next to Jake and I'm just tearing up,” Robert recalled of the emotional moment. “The lights come up and we hear that this exhibit is new. It's designed to make a grown man cry. I said, ‘Wow. You succeeded because the whole idea of fathers passing the game down to their sons was beautiful and personal. My dad passed it to me and now I'm sitting here passing it to him.”

An Instagram account believed to belong to Jake shares a glimpse into his life. His last post on Instagram was from nine weeks ago when he attended a wedding in Las Vegas, Nevada. The photos show him smiling. He also has a partner, and the pair appear to be very happy together.

In another Instagram post from May 15, Jake shared photos from a premiere he had attended for “Things Like This.” He shared his thoughts in the caption, writing, “New York & LA premieres of @thingslikethismovie! In theatres everywhere TOMORROW! (May 16).”

6.8

Genre:

Rap

Label:

Reviewed:

December 15, 2025

You won't find it in the gift shops or on the tourist board website, but amnesia is about as precise a postcard of a certain side of London as you'll find. While on paper this is a transatlantic link-up—Jawnino is from South London, while the production collective Surf Gang reps New York—it was recorded entirely in the UK capital, and these hazy London conjurings are hugely evocative of the city. Songs are littered with knowingly niche local references: tiny east London pub-clubs, competing rap rivals from the DVD era. But beyond these details, amnesia—in its blend of moody cloud rap, club trap, and stormy breaks—also invokes a specific malaise that has squatted over the UK for the last stagnating decade. It's the aural equivalent of being folded into the sofa, having a nice, long doomscroll.

The EP conjures, in particular, those liminal hours that stretch from club to couch. The synths on opener “40pageant” trickle like rain down a steamy bus window, while Jawnino skids over a scratchy breakbeat. His noncommittal drawl on “telly on the blink” sits somewhere between John Glacier's trippy streams of consciousness and Giggs' sullen cadence during road rap's late aughts peak. And if the general vibe wasn't enough to get this point across, there's a track called “bored of the uk” (refrain: “I'm so bored of the UK”) that drags the close sweatiness of Room 2 into your living room, and captures the feeling of the buzz slowly wearing off. It's music for soggy weather, sticky spliffs, and stunted ambitions. If living for the weekend used to be about working a 9-5 to fund your weekend bender of booze, birds, and bust-ups—the type once chronicled by Mike Skinner with the Streets—then Jawnino and Surf Gang paint a modern day equivalent that is more about clubbing yourself into a seven-day settee slump.

Neat as these portraits are, they're uniformly fleeting—gone just as soon as they've arrived, like passengers hopping on and off Underground train cars, or another vertical video flicked on with a nonchalant thumb. This can leave elements of amnesia feeling like a first draft. There's “glebe”'s eternal drift and lazy rhymes; “glitzince” gestures at an urban ennui rather than paint a convincing image of it. “contest” sounds like a loading screen, glittery looping keys and pitter-pat percs stuck in time; not necessarily a bad thing, but not what you're there for either. It's a little bit mood board: all broad direction, but without the actual aspirations. And, yes, partly that's the point. An affect: Jawnino sprawls on the beat, couched so deep between beats and bass that his voice becomes just another instrument moulding the gloom. But when a track like “alise” pierces the languor with its writhing hi-hats, drops of color, and visions of “Kylie Minogue at Butlins,” you get a hint of where this could all go with a shift of gears.

Most of these songs could fit within a YouTube Short. And they are ripe for bingeing: Played on a loop, Jawnino's nonchalant bars about afterparties or pubs or designer drugs burrow into your brain. The beats are inoffensive, cosy even. Before you know it, it's turned dark outside and the only glow in the room is coming from your phone and the tip of a cigarette dwindling in a makeshift beer-can ashtray. And Jawnino is riding that breakbeat again.

Genre:

Electronic

Label:

SVBKVLT

Reviewed:

December 15, 2025

DJ Narciso has worked tirelessly to carve out his own style of batida. While friend and fellow RS Produções member Nuno Beats was dropping a perky “Jet2 Holiday” remix, Narciso was working on a droning edit of Nirvana's “Something in the Way.” This year, the 20-something producer issued two solo releases for one of Lisbon's most celebrated underground labels, Príncipe. Diferenciado, the stronger of the two, trudged to the beat of tarraxo—a slowed-down version of kuduro designed for a couple's dance. At 90-100 BPM, tarraxo brings more swagger to the much quicker batida framework that's au courant among the scene's younger producers.

On Dentro De Mim, his debut release for the Shanghai-born label SVBKVLT, Narciso sometimes follows the crowd, and it's harder to enjoy his haunting, industrial style. In his best moments, he either goes slower or leaves enough space for his gothic sound design to flourish. The last kick drum in each bar of “Segredo” quakes as though the floorboards are about to cave in, and the swooshes of percussion on “Terrugem” fizz like parries from a cutlass. A nightmarish tone lingers over these tarraxo tracks as Narciso turns them into an unwieldy waltz, best danced aboard a ghostly pirate ship. SVBKVLT, with its reputation for gothic, cavernous, 21st-century club music, is the perfect home for such otherworldly material.

Some of his choices here can feel like missed opportunities. In “Pressão,” the groove sits stiffly atop pumping 130 BPM kick drums—instead of tarraxo's stalking plod—but the track never evolves beyond its caterwauling synths. Swimful's grime remix of the same track plays with space and tension better, weaving in a zigzagging harmonica synth and waiting until the end to layer and bend Narciso's screeching sirens into a strobic web. Narciso steps up for the faster-paced, techno-leaning tunes like “Agancha” where something uncanny lurks around every corner, be it a synth that howls like a werewolf or a coarse stirring like beating batter.

“Pesadelos” doesn't build quite as patiently as “Agancha,” but its robotic churn touches on another side of Narciso's artistry that resonates with a nascent subgenre of techno called mecha, which is currently being explored by U.S. producers like Zvrra, twofold, and Nondi_. Such a niche style could only spawn from young artists binging '90s anime, neo-noir comics, and indie video games in the outer reaches of the internet. Similarly, Narciso is a Lone Ranger of the batida scene. Dentro De Mim has all the ingredients of his singular and hermetic style, but it doesn't always home in on the most effective way to blend them. As opposed to his next big leap, Dentro De Mim feels like a welcome, yet hesitant, step down familiar paths.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Joseph Byrd, United States of America Bandleader, Dies at 87","https://pitchfork.com/news/joseph-byrd-united-states-of-america-bandleader-dies-at-87/","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 05:35:26 GMT","

Joseph Byrd, the co-founder, composer, and bandleader of the psych-rock outfit United States of America, has died, reports The New York Times. His family confirmed the news in a notice to The Los Angeles Times, stating that Byrd died on November 2 at home in Medford, Oregon. He was 87.

United States of America wrote songs that were equal parts hypnotic and otherworldly, pushing listeners to reconsider what they could take away from music. Although the band only released one album during their brief two-year run, they earned a cult following and made a traceable impact on the evolution of psych-rock and experimental pop, likely influencing the wave of Krautrock that would follow as well as bands like Stereolab, Broadcast, and Portishead.

Born on December 19, 1937 in Louisville, Kentucky, Byrd was raised in Tucson, Arizona, where he learned how to play accordion and vibraphone, joined a number of pop and country bands, and tried his hand at writing song arrangements. He quickly scaled his way through academics, going to University of Arizona to study composition and, later, a graduate program at Stanford University before leaping to University of California, Berkeley. Over the years, Byrd studied under Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and eventually John Cage, the latter of whom spent additional time tutoring him in New York City.

Byrd felt at home in New York's flourishing arts scene, debuting his first concert in 1961 in Yoko Ono's apartment following an introduction from La Monte Young. Later, Byrd worked as an assistant to composer Virgil Thomson and performed minimal music compositions during his own recital at Carnegie Hall. In 1963, Byrd left for Los Angeles with his then-girlfriend Dorothy Moskowitz. It was there that he joined the communist party, started a blues band with his new friend Linda Ronstadt, and began producing experimental arts events. Enthralled by the community and organizing shared happenings, Byrd was eager to dream up an even bigger project.

In 1967, Byrd and Moskowitz co-created United States of America to see what would happen by combining avant-garde rock music with electronic sound, political radicalism, and performance art. Armed with early synthesizers and an eagerness for tape manipulation, United States of America (Byrd, Moskowitz, Gordon Marron, Rand Forbes, and Craig Woodson) pushed the boundaries of prog-rock and psych-pop in the name of experimentalism. They recorded their first and only album, The United States of America, in December of that year with producer David Rubinson behind the boards. Byrd co-wrote the majority of the songs — and played the electric harpsichord, organ, calliope, piano, and synthesizer — while Moskowitz sang lead vocals.

Although United States of America were content with their recorded songs and toured in support of the album, including shows with the Velvet Underground and the Troggs, the LP was never a commercial success. Shortly after the band dissolved, in 1968, Byrd recorded The American Metaphysical Circus in 1969 under the name Joe Byrd and the Field Hippies. It, too, became an influential record in the world of underground music, but it took years of getting passed around to achieve that status.

Later in life, Byrd became a professor of American music at California State University, Fullerton, and scored a number of arthouse movies, including films by Robert Altman, Agnes Varda, and Bruce Clark.

Bill Callahan has shared “Lonely City,” the second single from his February-bound album My Days of 58. The music video comprises a photo montage compiled by the street photographer Daniel Arnold, who documents the hubbub, glamor, camaraderie, isolation in crowds, small joys, small horrors, and seedy underbelly of New York in a photo series shot over the course of 15 years. Watch it below.

In a press release, Callahan describes his longtime dilemma over writing a song about a city, rather than people:

“‘Lonely City' is a song I've been meaning to write for decades. It has been inside me that long. I tend to focus my writing on humans and the spirit within. So writing about concrete and steel felt like a no go. Like I'm going to write a song about a car next?

But of course cities are made by humans so they are human, too.

You have a relationship with them, like friends. 

You get mad at them when you get a parking ticket, you love them when they offer you a nice meal. 

It's a song acknowledging all this.”

The first single from My Days of 58, which is out February 27, was “The Man I'm Supposed to Be.” The core band that plays with Callahan on the new LP is the same as that of 2024 live album Resuscitate: guitarist Matt Kinsey, tenor saxophonist Dustin Laurenzi, and drummer Jim White. Jerry David DeCicca plays tambourine on “Lonely City.”

Nick Reiner, the son of legendary actor and director Rob Reiner and photographer Michele Singer, has been arrested after allegedly killing his parents in their Los Angeles home.


	Nick, 32, was arrested at 9:15 p.m. local time Sunday and booked early Monday morning, according to online jail records from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. “He was arrested [on suspicion of] murder,” a law-enforcement source tells Rolling Stone. He was being held at the Parker Center jail, downtown, with his bail set at $4 million. 


	Reiner and Singer were found dead Sunday afternoon. A source later confirmed to Rolling Stone that the couple's youngest child, Romy, had found her parents' bodies. Paramedics, firefighters, and police officers were dispatched to the Reiners' home in the upscale Brentwood neighborhood. Detectives at the scene Sunday night were waiting for a warrant to properly search the house.


	At the time, LAPD Deputy Chief Alan Hamilton said police were “not seeking anyone as a suspect or as a person of interest.” A source told Rolling Stone on Sunday night that Nick was believed to have been involved in the homicides.

	While the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Reiner and Singer remain murky, Nick previously discussed his battles with drug addiction, specifically heroin. He first went to rehab when he was 15, and was in and out of rehab facilities for years. He told People in 2016 that he experienced homelessness in Maine, New Jersey, and Texas. When he was 22, he drew on his experience for the semi-autobiographical film Being Charlie, which he co-wrote and his father directed.

	In an interview with the Los Angeles Times regarding the film, Reiner and Singer spoke about the challenges Nick faced in rehab and acknowledged their own regrets with the way they responded. “The program works for some people, but it can't work for everybody,” Reiner said. “When Nick would tell us that it wasn't working for him, we wouldn't listen. We were desperate, and because the people had diplomas on their wall, we listened to them when we should have been listening to our son.”


	Singer noted, “We were so influenced by these people. They would tell us he's a liar, that he was trying to manipulate us. And we believed them.”

	As the film world and people of good taste around the world mourn the sudden death of legendary director Rob Reiner and his wife Michele Singer, President Donald Trump jumped to make the apparent double homicide about himself. 


	In an early morning Truth Social post, the president wrote that the couple had “passed away,” due to “the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.” 


	“He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before,” Trump added. “May Rob and Michele rest in peace.” 


	Reiner was known for directing several classic films including This is Spinal Tap, Stand by Me, The Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally, and A Few Good Men, was found dead in his California home on Sunday along with Singer.  According to the Los Angeles Times, a member of Reiner's family has been questioned in connection with the couple's death, which is being investigated as a homicide.

	The couple were actively involved in politics, and their deaths were publicly mourned by prominent Democratic political figures including former President Barack Obama, and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). 

	











	“Rob's achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen,” Obama wrote on X. “But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people — and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action. Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired.”

Rob Reiner‘s expansive legacy didn't end with his vast contributions to film and television. The acclaimed actor and director, who was found dead alongside his wife, Michele, at their California home Sunday night, was also outspoken in his championing of civil rights. His activism has been celebrated by numerous political figures following news of his death.


	“Rob's achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen,” former president Barack Obama shared in a statement on X. “But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people — and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action. Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired.”


	Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi wrote, “Personally, Rob cared deeply about people and demonstrated that in his civic activities — whether by supporting the First 5 initiative or fighting against Prop 8 in California. Civically, he was a champion for the First Amendment and the creative rights of artists. And professionally, he was an iconic figure in film who made us laugh, cry and think with the movies he created.”

	Reiner's political perspective shaped an array of releases throughout his career as he encouraged audiences to dig deeper into the politics and politicians shaping America. In 2017, he released Shock and Awe, a film critical of the George W. Bush administration. It arrived just a year after he chronicled the start of Lyndon B. Johnson's presidency as successor to John F. Kennedy in 2016's LBJ. Last year, he produced the documentary God & Country, which tracked the rise of Christian nationalism and its connection to the far right.

	











	Reiner's directorial efforts also include the career-defining releases A Few Good Men and The American President. The political thread that runs throughout his filmography can be traced back to his role as Michael “Meathead” Stivic in All in the Family, as well. “Rob Reiner's work has impacted generations of Americans,” former vice president Kamala Harris wrote on X. “The characters, dialogue, and visuals he brought to life in film and television are woven throughout our culture. Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America's democracy.”

	Last year, Reiner looked back at All in the Family in an interview with Rolling Stone, saying, “Archie Bunker was a conservative and a patriot, but also a racist. And what we're seeing now is the weaponization of that racism.… These people [Christian nationalists] are fine with the idea that America should be a white, Christian nation. They're frightened of what's happening in this country with diversity. But we are a pluralistic society.”


	Earlier this year, Reiner backed Bruce Springsteen as the musician sparred with Donald Trump and made a point to encourage people to look at the bigger picture, rather than the theatrics of the moment. “Millions of people died so that fascism wouldn't come to our shores, so that we'd preserve our democracy, and 80 years later, we're faced with a possible fascist takeover,” he told Rolling Stone in May. “We're gonna fight hard to make sure that that doesn't happen.… We have to keep Trump's feet to the fire, because for the countries that have become autocracies, for the most part, it takes years to start changing the constitution, to start changing the electorate, to make the disinformation take hold.”


	“Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass shared in a statement on X. “An acclaimed actor, director, producer, writer, and engaged political activist, he always used his gifts in service of others.”

	Bass highlighted Reiner's contribution to the creation of First 5 California, an organization founded in 1998 to redirect a portion of funds from tobacco sales to early childhood development resources in local communities. She also noted, “He and Michele fought for early childhood development and marriage equality, working to overturn Proposition 8. They were true champions for LGBTQ+ rights.”

	











	California Governor Gavin Newsom echoed these sentiments in his statement. “Rob was a passionate advocate for children and for civil rights — from taking on Big Tobacco, fighting for marriage equality, to serving as a powerful voice in early education. He made California a better place through his good works,” he said on X. “Rob will be remembered for his remarkable filmography and for his extraordinary contribution to humanity.”


	Newsom added, “Rob was the big-hearted genius behind so many of the classic stories we love, with projects as wide-ranging as The Princess Bride to A Few Good Men. His boundless empathy made his stories timeless, teaching generations how to see goodness and righteousness in others — and encouraging us to dream bigger.”

And they were good, generous people who made everyone who knew them better through their active citizenship in defense of inclusive democracy, setting an example for us all to follow. Hillary and I will always be grateful for their friendship, unfailing kindness, and support.”


	Senator Elizabeth Warren shared a photo with Reiner on X with the caption, “I was devastated to hear about the loss of Rob Reiner and Michele Singer. Rob is a generational talent that used his voice to advocate for a better world. We live in a better country because of them. They will be missed.”

Rob Reiner, the legendary director and actor who rose to prominence in All in the Family and went on to direct the classic film comedies This Is Spinal Tap, The Princess Bride and When Harry Met Sally…, died in his California home with his wife, Michele Singer, on Sunday. He was 78.


	“It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner,” his family said in a statement. “We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.” 


	Police are treating the deaths as apparent homicides. According to the L.A. Times, authorities have questioned a member of Reiner's family in connection with the death. As of Sunday night, the LAPD have not officially identified a suspect, but Rolling Stone has confirmed that Reiner's son, Nick, was involved in the homicide. A source confirmed to Rolling Stone that the couple's daughter, Romy, found her parents' bodies.

	The couple were found dead Sunday afternoon. Los Angeles Robbery Homicide Division detectives have been assigned to the case, NBC Los Angeles reports. Paramedics had been called to the home at around 3:30 p.m. and officers were dispatched after firefighters discovered a death.

	











	“This is a devastating loss for our city and our country. Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass wrote. “An acclaimed actor, director, producer, writer, and engaged political activist, he always used his gifts in service of others.”

	











	Born March 6, 1947, in New York, Reiner was the son of Carl Reiner, a giant in television and film comedy who created The Dick Van Dyke Show and directed The Jerk. When Rob set out to make his own name, he tried not to ride his father's sizable coattails. “I didn't take any money from him,” he recalled in 2016. “I didn't take any advice. … I knew I was going to get that [nepotism] stuff. … But I knew in my head what I had done.”

	While Reiner played several bit roles in popular television shows in the Sixties, including Batman and The Andy Griffith Show, and partnered with Steve Martin writing for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, his breakout role came in the Seventies playing the liberal Mike “Meathead” Stivic, the son-in-law of the cantankerous conservative Archie Bunker (Carroll O'Connor) in Norman Lear's hit sitcom, All in the Family, which ran from 1971 through 1979. Reiner won two Emmys for the portrayal.


	During that time, he also guest starred on The Partridge Family and created the sitcom The Super, with Phil Mishkin and Gerry Isenberg, which aired in 1972.


	But his artistic legacy was cemented by the string of wonderful, varied comedies he directed in the 1980s and 1990s. With his 1984 debut This Is Spinal Tap, a mockumentary about a notoriously terrible U.K. metal band, Reiner worked with his stars and co-writers Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer to craft a heavily improvised film that made fun of rock-star egos and artistic pretensions. For Reiner, who was trying to make the leap from sitcom actor to movie director, the movie was a chance to prove himself to a skeptical industry.


	“At that time,” he wrote in the 2025 book A Fine Line Between Stupid and Clever: The Story of Spinal Tap, “there was a big chasm in Hollywood between those who worked in television and those who worked in movies. The film people were considered royalty. They looked down on the lowly peasants of TV. Today, actors, writers, and directors easily shuttle between movies and television. But it wasn't until such sitcom alums as Ron Howard, Danny DeVito, Penny Marshall, and I, along with the TV writers Barry Levinson and Jim Brooks, were successfully directing movies in the Eighties that these dividing lines were erased.”

	He followed This Is Spinal Tap with the 1985 romantic comedy The Sure Thing, starring relative unknown John Cusack, but his next five films were indelible. Adapting Stephen King's novella The Body into Stand by Me, Reiner demonstrated his ability to elicit wonderfully lived-in performances from his young cast, which included Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell. The film launched their Hollywood careers and remains a beloved coming-of-age tale that Reiner once claimed was the film that meant the most to him.

	











	“[I]t was the first time I did a movie that really reflected my personality,” he later said. “It has some melancholy in it, it has some emotion and it also has humor in it and the music was of my time… I think people relate to it. There's a line at the end of the movie where they say, ‘You never have friends like you do when you are 12.' And that's a true thing. When you bond with your friends when you are 12 years old, it's a very strong emotional bond.”


	The next year, he tackled another adaptation, William Goldman's fantasy book The Princess Bride, and showed he was just as capable at crafting a tender, funny fairy tale. As with his previous movies, The Princess Bride wasn't simply popular but proved to be a warehouse for endlessly quotable lines: “Have fun storming the castle!” “Inconceivable!” These early hits catered to all ages, but with his 1989 film, When Harry Met Sally…, he produced one of the period's wisest, most grown-up romantic comedies.


	Working from Nora Ephron's flawless script, Reiner told the story of two platonic friends, Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan), who eventually discover that they love each other. When Harry Met Sally… took the urban sophistication of Woody Allen's best New York love stories and married it to contemporary concerns about relationships and, of course, faking orgasms. (The movie's famous scene with Ryan faking it in a restaurant was capped with Reiner's own mother Estelle saying the key line: “I'll have what she's having.”)


	Reiner didn't just master comedies: His 1990 adaptation of King's bestselling novel Misery won Kathy Bates an Oscar for terrorizing James Caan's poor novelist Paul Sheldon. Although darkly funny, Misery was also legitimately scary, further illustrating Reiner's ability to produce excellent mainstream Hollywood entertainment across genres.


	That roll continued with 1992's A Few Good Men, with Aaron Sorkin adapting his own play for a live-wire courtroom drama highlighted by terrific performances from, among others, Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson, whose momentous “You can't handle the truth!” showdown was just one more example of Reiner conjuring up instant-classic moments in his box-office hits.


	In the midst of this incredible run, he was unfailingly modest about his talents. “I'm not great at anything, but I'm real good at a lot of things,” he told Film Comment in 1987. “I'm a pretty good actor, a pretty good writer, I have pretty good music abilities, pretty good visual and color and costume sense. I'm not great at any of these things, but as a director I have the opportunity to utilize all these things in one job. Which is why I like doing it. … I pick people who are creative and gentle and are willing to struggle along with me a little bit if I'm not exactly sure. People say it's a real sin for a director to ever admit he doesn't know what he wants. But I'm as confused as the next guy.”

	











	Reiner would knock out one last indisputable gem, the 1995 White House rom-com The American President. But if his career never contained another movie that captured the public's imagination, he continued to make films on myriad topics, focusing chiefly on political issues he cared about. An outspoken liberal who criticized George W. Bush and Donald Trump, he turned that anger at the country's right-ward direction into pictures such as LBJ and Shock and Awe, which were provocations meant to inspire everyday Americans to look more closely at their government.


	He would occasionally return to acting, agreeing to a recurring role in New Girl. Reiner appeared in movies like 1987's Throw Momma From the Train and 1993's Sleepless in Seattle, and he was delightful in 2013's The Wolf of Wall Street playing the father of Leonardo DiCaprio's unscrupulous stockbroker ​​Jordan Belfort. And he enjoyed spoofing his own leftie image, playing himself as Rep. Rob Reiner in a memorable episode of 30 Rock.


	Most recently, he made his first sequel, directing Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, which arrived in theaters in September. He reunited with Shearer, McKean, and Guest, reprising his role as clueless documentarian Marty DiBergi. Reiner and his stars had long resisted the temptation to make a Part Two. “We never even considered it,” he wrote in A Fine Line Between Stupid and Clever. “Why fuck with a classic? … But after a few more meetings, we saw that we still made each other laugh.”


	Despite the wealth of enduring favorites Reiner directed, he was only nominated for one Oscar (Best Picture for A Few Good Men). But the endless rewatchability of his best movies speaks to what he achieved as a mainstream filmmaker, blending craft, smarts, heart, and humor in a way few directors managed.

	Asked what makes a “Rob Reiner film” by 60 Minutes in 1994, Reiner explained that it was hard to categorize given his range of films, but “the main character in the film is always going through something that I've experienced or am experiencing, and I try to make it as personal as possible,” he said.


	“It's the only way I know how to tell a story,” he continued. “I didn't come through the film schools. I'm an actor, and I approach it from, can I inhabit the insides of this character? Can I be this person? And if I can, then I know how to tell the story of what that person is going through. And I also know how to tell the actor who's playing that part how to play the part.”

	A shooting at Brown University on Saturday left at least two students dead and nine others injured. On Sunday, a person of interest was taken into custody in connection with the shooting.


	According to multiple reports — including from The Washington Post,  NBC News, and CNN — multiple sources briefed on the investigation have identified the person of interest as a 24-year-old man from Wisconsin. Federal agents detained the person of interest at a hotel in nearby Coventry, Rhode Island, FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement on X on Sunday morning. He added that the bureau used its Cellular Analysis Survey Team for its geolocation capabilities to locate the person of interest and that it was deploying resources to reconstruct the scene. As of early Sunday evening, the person of interest has not been charged and has not been named as a suspect in the shooting. No potential motive has been provided.


	The shooting on Saturday began at the prestigious Providence, Rhode Island university at around 4 p.m., inside a classroom in the university's Barus and Holley engineering and physics building. It took place during one of the busiest times as the school is in the midst of final exams. On Saturday evening, Providence police released video footage of a person of interest, which showed a person dressed in black, walking around a corner from the scene. The incident set off a shelter-in-place order, which kept students and faculty locked down on campus overnight, until Sunday morning following the detainment of a person of interest. In the wake of the tragedy, classes and exams were canceled.

	A law enforcement official told The Associated Press that the gunman fired more than 40 rounds from a 9 mm handgun, and that two handguns were recovered when the person of interest was taken into custody.

	











	As of early Sunday evening, one of the nine wounded students has been released from the hospital, University President Christina Paxson said during a news conference. Six others are in critical but stable condition, one is in critical condition, and one is in stable condition, a hospital spokesperson told The Washington Post. Officials involved in the investigation have not yet released the names of the victims. Durham Academy, a private K-12 school in Durham, North Carolina, confirmed that a recent graduate, Kendall Turner, was critically wounded. “Our school community is rallying around Kendall, her classmates, and her loved ones, and we will continue to offer our full support in the days ahead,” the school said, via AP.

	On Sunday night, members of the community gathered for a candlelight vigil at Lippitt Memorial Park to honor the victims of Saturday's mass shooting. The event was supposed to be a holiday celebration featuring a Christmas tree and menorah lighting, that instead served as a place to grieve and show support for one another in the wake of the tragedy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","‘A lot of stories but very few facts': sceptics push back on buzzy UFO documentary","https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/15/the-age-of-disclosure-ufo-documentary","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 12:04:00 GMT","

The Age of Disclosure was granted a Capitol Hill screening and has broken digital rental records but does it really offer proof of alien life?

It has been hailed as a game changer in public attitudes towards UFOs, ending a culture of silence around claims once dismissed as the preserve of conspiracy theorists and crackpots.

The Age of Disclosure has been boosted in its effort to shift the conversation about extraterrestrials from the fringe to the mainstream with a Capitol Hill screening and considerable commercial success. It broke the record for highest-grossing documentary on Amazon's Prime Video within 48 hours of its release, Deadline reported this week.

But not everyone is impressed by the film's claims that UFOs – now called UAPs (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) – are real and that governments have been hiding evidence for decades. Several sceptics have gone online to push back at The Age of Disclosure, contending that it has been over-hyped and fails to present new or compelling evidence.

In their telling, the documentary has slick production values but rehashes familiar, decades-old grainy infrared videos and anecdotal pilot testimonies insufficient to support extraordinary claims of alien technology.

Michael Shermer, the founding publisher of Skeptic magazine, says by phone from Santa Barbara, California: “All we have are blurry photographs, grainy videos and anecdotes from people that say they know somebody who knows something, or they know somebody who said they saw the spaceship, touched the aliens or worked on back engineering the spaceships and so on.

“But if you say, who was this person you talked to? ‘Well, I can't tell you.' Where was the spaceship? ‘I can't tell you.' Do you have any photographs? ‘No, but here's this grainy video of this blob that was taken from a navy pilot 14 years ago off the coast of San Diego. This is kind of weird. It's hard to say what it is but it could be aliens.'”

Shermer, who for 30 years taught college and university courses in critical thinking and has written books including Why People Believe Weird Things, adds: “From a scientific point of view, none of this is valuable other than well, there might be something interesting here, let's go find out. It's no different from the whole search for Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Yeti, that whole thing.”

Directed and produced by Dan Farah, The Age of Disclosure asserts an 80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligent life and secret recovery and reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial technology. It features interviews with 34 individuals from US government, military and intelligence backgrounds.

They include secretary of state and national security adviser Marco Rubio, senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota and former director of national intelligence James Clapper. Their presence has been seen as giving the film heft and helping reduce the stigma long felt by alleged UAP witnesses.

In an interview last week on Fox News, Rubio was asked about his claim in the documentary that unknown entities have been operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities. He did not attack the documentary or seek to disown his remarks – but he did seek to add some context.

“First of all, I'm not disavowing that,” Rubio said. “It was an interview that was done almost, like, maybe three or four years ago when I was in the senate. So it wasn't recent. The second point I would make, I was describing the allegations that people have come forward with … I was describing what people had said to me, not things that I had firsthand knowledge of in that regard. A little bit of selective editing, but it's okay because you're trying to sell a show there.”

Sceptics argue that UAP sightings are better explained by a combination of misidentification of mundane objects (balloons, satellites, drones), perceptual errors in low-information environments, secret terrestrial technologies and misunderstood optical and sensor phenomena.

Jason Colavito, author of The Cult of Alien Gods: HP Lovecraft and Extraterrestrial Pop Culture, comments: “While I can't possibly give a single explanation for UFOs, or categorically say that no UFO has ever been an alien spaceship, every UFO that has ever been identified has turned out to be a prosaic – either natural or human made – object, and there's no reason to suspect that any of the objects seen in that movie are anything but that.”

Colavito was left cold by The Age of Disclosure. “I found the film to basically be an Ancient Aliens episode with better lighting,” he says. “It was a rehash of material that has been used many times before. I thought that it was old stuff in a slick new package. A lot of the people that you saw interviewed have already appeared on Ancient Aliens, on NewsNation and on other platforms saying the same thing.

“The only surprising thing was that they actually went into some of the more extreme and ridiculous pseudoscientific claims they make about how we can't photograph UFOs clearly because they're in a space time quantum bubble that distorts all the light around them so we can't see them. That's obviously an ex post facto explanation. These are things that people who are very smart have fooled themselves into thinking are true in order to justify a belief that they already came into the process holding.”

Colavito notes that the film has had an extensive and expensive publicity campaign including a Hollywood-style premiere. He sees it as part of a sophisticated media campaign aimed at securing government funding for defence contractors and associated thinktanks.

“One of the things that surprised me is how much of the film seemed to be an advertisement for investing in UFO-themed energy research. That's where you have to look into the question of how many of the talking heads in that documentary have government ties, not just that they formerly worked in the government, but that they are currently profiting from the work that they're doing promoting UFOs.

“Luis Elizondo [an author and UAP disclosure activist who also serves as an executive producer on the film], for example, works for a defence contracting company, or at least did until recently, and many of the others also have current or former ties to defence contractors and other businesses and entities that make money from government contracts and government investment.”

But for all the headlines and TV attention, Colavito doubts that the buzz will last. “It's already fading from coverage,” he says. “This was the kind of thing that has a big publicity campaign leading up to it but then, once people begin to see the actual product, interest falls off rapidly because there is nothing new and nothing convincing in the film. There are a lot of stories but very few facts.”

Joshua Semeter, director of Boston University's Center for Space Physics, has only seen the trailer for The Age of Disclosure and was unimpressed. “I guess the word is disappointed to see that their primary evidence is all of these grainy infrared videos.” he says. “There's a lot of money to be made by keeping things in the spooky category. That's basically what's going on here.”

Semeter, who served on a Nasa team studying the origin of UAPs, believes that the film is unlikely to create a lasting cultural shift or mainstream acceptance of its claims. Instead it is the culmination of a recent period of heightened interest in UAPs.

“We went through a UAP bubble over the past eight years and a lot of this evidence that's being put forth by the aviators is very old evidence from the 2000s. We're at the tail end. This production was an effort to grab the last little bits as we head out of the current UAP bubble.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","other"

The Age of Disclosure was granted a Capitol Hill screening and has broken digital rental records but does it really offer proof of alien life?

It has been hailed as a game changer in public attitudes towards UFOs, ending a culture of silence around claims once dismissed as the preserve of conspiracy theorists and crackpots.

The Age of Disclosure has been boosted in its effort to shift the conversation about extraterrestrials from the fringe to the mainstream with a Capitol Hill screening and considerable commercial success. It broke the record for highest-grossing documentary on Amazon's Prime Video within 48 hours of its release, Deadline reported this week.

But not everyone is impressed by the film's claims that UFOs – now called UAPs (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) – are real and that governments have been hiding evidence for decades. Several sceptics have gone online to push back at The Age of Disclosure, contending that it has been over-hyped and fails to present new or compelling evidence.

In their telling, the documentary has slick production values but rehashes familiar, decades-old grainy infrared videos and anecdotal pilot testimonies insufficient to support extraordinary claims of alien technology.

Michael Shermer, the founding publisher of Skeptic magazine, says by phone from Santa Barbara, California: “All we have are blurry photographs, grainy videos and anecdotes from people that say they know somebody who knows something, or they know somebody who said they saw the spaceship, touched the aliens or worked on back engineering the spaceships and so on.

“But if you say, who was this person you talked to? ‘Well, I can't tell you.' Where was the spaceship? ‘I can't tell you.' Do you have any photographs? ‘No, but here's this grainy video of this blob that was taken from a navy pilot 14 years ago off the coast of San Diego. This is kind of weird. It's hard to say what it is but it could be aliens.'”

Shermer, who for 30 years taught college and university courses in critical thinking and has written books including Why People Believe Weird Things, adds: “From a scientific point of view, none of this is valuable other than well, there might be something interesting here, let's go find out. It's no different from the whole search for Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Yeti, that whole thing.”

Directed and produced by Dan Farah, The Age of Disclosure asserts an 80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligent life and secret recovery and reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial technology. It features interviews with 34 individuals from US government, military and intelligence backgrounds.

They include secretary of state and national security adviser Marco Rubio, senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota and former director of national intelligence James Clapper. Their presence has been seen as giving the film heft and helping reduce the stigma long felt by alleged UAP witnesses.

In an interview last week on Fox News, Rubio was asked about his claim in the documentary that unknown entities have been operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities. He did not attack the documentary or seek to disown his remarks – but he did seek to add some context.

“First of all, I'm not disavowing that,” Rubio said. “It was an interview that was done almost, like, maybe three or four years ago when I was in the senate. So it wasn't recent. The second point I would make, I was describing the allegations that people have come forward with … I was describing what people had said to me, not things that I had firsthand knowledge of in that regard. A little bit of selective editing, but it's okay because you're trying to sell a show there.”

Sceptics argue that UAP sightings are better explained by a combination of misidentification of mundane objects (balloons, satellites, drones), perceptual errors in low-information environments, secret terrestrial technologies and misunderstood optical and sensor phenomena.

Jason Colavito, author of The Cult of Alien Gods: HP Lovecraft and Extraterrestrial Pop Culture, comments: “While I can't possibly give a single explanation for UFOs, or categorically say that no UFO has ever been an alien spaceship, every UFO that has ever been identified has turned out to be a prosaic – either natural or human made – object, and there's no reason to suspect that any of the objects seen in that movie are anything but that.”

Here is the full transcript of American artist and filmmaker Jeremy Corbell's interview: “UAPs, Military Footage, and What the Government Isn't Telling Us” on Shane Smith Has Questions Podcast, August 28, 2025. 

Brief Notes: Shane Smith sits down with investigative filmmaker and UFO researcher Jeremy Corbell to break down what the U.S. military is actually seeing in the skies, seas, and even active war zones. Corbell walks through vetted military UAP footage like the “Mosul Orb,” pyramid-shaped craft over Navy destroyers, and tic tac–style objects that outmaneuver front-line fighter jets without visible propulsion or heat signatures. The two dig into whistleblower claims about crash-retrieval programs and “biologics,” the government's shift from “UFO” to “UAP,” and why Corbell believes the public has been systematically misled for decades. This conversation asks what counts as proof, why officials still resist full disclosure, and how confirming non-human intelligence could upend politics, religion, and our basic understanding of reality. 

SHANE SMITH: In podcasting, there's a long-held tradition to talk about aliens, UFOs and abductions. So we're going to do our version of a UAP UFO, Are There Aliens Out There Podcast this week on Shane Smith Has Questions. We hope you enjoy it. Let's hear you in the comments. Bango.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah, it's cool.

Meeting Jeremy Corbell: Investigative Filmmaker and UAP Researcher


SHANE SMITH: All right, here we go. Jeremy Corbell, investigative filmmaker, UFO, UAP researcher. I want to get into the difference when that switched. Known for your documentaries on Netflix including I just watched it. Bob Lazar, Area 51.

[Video clip: “Exactly. What's going on up there? What's going on up there could be the most important event in history.”]

SHANE SMITH: But you do a lot of viral releases of military UFO footage, often through collaborations with George Knapp. And you do a podcast called Weaponized.

JEREMY CORBELL: All of that is fact.

SHANE SMITH: There you go.

JEREMY CORBELL: So far so good.

SHANE SMITH: Welcome, welcome, welcome. So I have a lot of stuff I want to do but I want to start. Maybe we could just jump in with you. You just released some footage today.

The Importance of Vetted Military Footage


JEREMY CORBELL: Yes.

[Video clip: “This is an example of one of the UFOs that our military and intelligence community is looking at. Where this orb or this metallic looking ball runs alongside a spy plane.”]

Okay, so footage, yeah. Yes. You used a word, viral. That's cool. It gets out there for sure to the world. And that's the point is to get it seen from tabloid to mainstream media democratically, instantaneously. That's the goal. Military filmed footage of what they designated UAP or UFO.

So we vet it, verify it, find all the sources. George Knapp, you mentioned is the Godfather.

SHANE SMITH: Sorry, this is important because if it's just somebody saying we made it up, it's this, it's that. This is vetted military footage. Their footage. Yes, that.

JEREMY CORBELL: Okay, so that distinction. So nowadays, out of the hundreds of thousands of videos that are recorded of what people think are UFOs. Yeah. You can't tell anymore. Right. Anything can be made better than reality.

But when you have chain of custody, you have cases that are passed around, intelligence agencies that are guarded, that don't want the American public to see, you know, and they're usually filmed on military platforms. Those sensor systems are better. We have a sensor bias when it comes to UFO footage because great sensors pick up thermal, heat signatures, all that stuff.

So the whole point of this is that when you get something, if you can vet and verify its kind of chain of custody, its authenticity. I'm not calling these UFOs. Your government has labeled them UAP, which just means UFO, basically. And—

SHANE SMITH: Sorry, I'm going to keep interrupting.

JEREMY CORBELL: No, no, it's fine.

Why the Shift from UFO to UAP?


SHANE SMITH: What's the difference? Why did we switch from UFO to UAP?

JEREMY CORBELL: Okay, well, originally, UFO was created to try to make a laugh factory out of the idea of Unidentified Flying Objects. In their infinite wisdom, truly in their infinite wisdom, people that really wanted to better describe what was being observed, they called them UAP, Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena.

Because they're not just flying. They go from space to air to sea with zero inertia. So you can pop into the water without a splash. How is that possible? So they call it all domain. Right. So it goes from space to air to sea. If it's there, it's unknown. It's anomalous.

UAPs, they did that to destigmatize reporting. Because if you're on a ship and you see something that you can't explain, what are you supposed to write? What it is they used to say. “I'm not writing UFO. No, I'm definitely not writing. You writing UFO? Nope. Didn't see it. Okay, cool.”

SHANE SMITH: Right? Because it's got a negative—

JEREMY CORBELL: Right. So now they're kind of normalizing reporting with the military and the world by saying, “Look, we don't know what it is, it's anomalous, it's unidentified or whatever.” But Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. And then when you write that after—

SHANE SMITH: More credible.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah.

The Mosul Orb: A Major Release


SHANE SMITH: Now I don't want to go to get off track. Mosul.

JEREMY CORBELL: Okay. Mosul orb. So—

SHANE SMITH: Mosul orb. This is a big deal.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah.

SHANE SMITH: So tell me why.

JEREMY CORBELL: Okay, yeah, we can go one for one. I can rapid fire. So check it out. Here's the brass tacks. There was a CIA plane and it was flying over a conflict zone. An active war zone. They were targeting a terrorist compound.

As they were doing that, they got what's called a passive capture of a UAP. It's spherical. It appeared spherical. So our first episode of Weaponized, mine and George Knapp's podcast. At the end we're like, “Okay, you want to see what the government terms UFO or UAP? Here you go.”

But I just released the still image because at the time I was figuring out the legality of obtaining and releasing as a journalist stuff that I am not authorized to know its classification. I knew exactly where it went through. I verified it with a ton of people as part of a UAP product to teach people about UFOs.

So I knew that was a UFO and our government had labeled it such. And I knew it was unresolved when I reported on it in 2023 with George. Right. But the pictures from 2016 and the sensitivity of that compound, I don't know. You get in trouble for the compound, not the UFO.

So I released a still image as a way to provoke Aero All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office. Kind of like the modern day Project Blue Book, but worse.

[Archival footage: “I am here to discuss the so-called flying saucers. The Air Force interest in this problem has been due to our feeling of an obligation to identify and analyze to the best of our ability anything in the air that may have the possibility of threat or menace to the United States.”]

JEREMY CORBELL: I was like, “Put out the footage, show the American public.” It got leaked to me. I obtained and released as a journalist. So I put out a still image, never put out the video.

And then all of a sudden I got this wicked smart friend and he sued the government, he sued the Air Force, he sued Central Command, I don't know, a bunch of people he sued and they Freedom of Information Act request and litigated for two years quietly.

First thing he gets, he calls me up, he goes, “No way. I think I got something. No way. Jeremy, can you tell me, is this what I think it is?” Boom. He sends it on my phone. I go, “Stop sending it. Don't tell anybody. Shut up. We're doing it next week.”

SHANE SMITH: Wow.

JEREMY CORBELL: Because they would give a false sense of transparency by putting it out. What comes to light is that my reporting was correct. I wasn't talking out of my a. Absolutely. There was four seconds like I said. And if people said it was a raindrop, it was a pothole. They said all this because I just gave a still image. That's why I started doing videos legally obtained.

And this is a huge win for journalism and a huge win for Freedom of Information Act requests. And a huge win for the litigation process of journalists and any American trying to get from the government what they don't want you to see, which is that UAP are made not by us, not by China, not by Russia. I mean, some are, they're misidentified. You know, we've got a cool plane.

SHANE SMITH: Yeah.

JEREMY CORBELL: Somebody's making these machines that can outpace, outmaneuver and outperform our greatest weapon systems. Whose are they? Well, those are the bigger questions, but all I know is the Mosul Orb dropped the footage today, legally obtained through litigation, and it proved that I was reporting correctly that there is a—what appears to be a spherical ball with no drop or descent.

We don't know if it's moving or just the CIA plane was moving, but they think it's UAP. Actually, two days ago, it's unresolved UAP. So we reported on it. And this kid's name is Dustin Slaughter. Everybody take a note, that kid is wicked smart.

SHANE SMITH: There he goes. And he got the FOIA released.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yes, sir.

What Makes UAP Footage Credible?


SHANE SMITH: So it's footage of something. We don't know what it is, but it's nothing. It's not like a drone. It's not like—

JEREMY CORBELL: Right. So we can eliminate certain things. Good whiskey, by the way.

SHANE SMITH: What is this?

JEREMY CORBELL: Cheers. She's nice. We met each other a long a time ago in your office, man.

So yeah, and I mean I have opinions and I'll give you those. But what we're seeing with every piece of footage that George Knapp and I obtain and release is what our government labels a UAP or UFO. Meaning it's not our black project. It's not a known adversarial black project, adversarial nation.

And it can demonstrate characteristics unlike what we have for flight and maintaining flight, like a positive lift without winglets and engines. And in the thermal realm, it gets even weirder because you don't see heat signatures. How is that possible?

Everything is like rockets to roller skates. You push something out the back to go forward. These UAP don't have that same signature management, as they say. So you're like, “What is it? How does it fly? Who pilots them?”

Some might be drones or autonomously controlled, but some of them, as reported to Congress under oath by David Grusch, have had biologics inside of them. “Do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft? Biologics came with some of these recoveries.”

SHANE SMITH: Yeah, well, let's get into that. Hold on. Before we do. We're already into the deep stuff. Before we do, I wanted to go through—

JEREMY CORBELL: There is no light conversation about UAP. It's—

SHANE SMITH: There you go. Come on. I want to get into some of the more famous, let's say video footage. And you can explain. I'm going to get out of my chair, if you can believe that. I'm coming over. Okay, so we're going to just go through. So that's the Mosul orb.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah. Which they said was a pothole. When I released the image, all the debunker weirdos.

SHANE SMITH: Right.

JEREMY CORBELL: You know, it's not.

Reviewing Other Notable UAP Footage


SHANE SMITH: This is your one, right?

JEREMY CORBELL: Well, I mean, not mine.

SHANE SMITH: Yeah, but you released yours.

JEREMY CORBELL: Okay. So this is also more of a spherical. We think by angle of observation. And the cool thing about this, the Navy guys, they say “splash.” They didn't mean it made a splash. It descended. Controlled descent. It was illuminated into the water.

They sent a sub to try to look for it. It couldn't find it. There was 100 of these. Over 100 around 10 Navy warships in 100 mile radius. Every ship was getting comms. And I've talked to people on every single ship whose job it was to fight the ship. And to this day, they don't know what it was.

SHANE SMITH: And so the narrative. There are naval officers, correct?

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah.

SHANE SMITH: So this is the flashing pyramid.

JEREMY CORBELL: So it's triangle. It's triangle by angle of observation. Now, some people say bokeh. And I say, “Okay,” because the thing is, they're saying there's a lens problem.

The problem with their theory is that this was range found on the back of the ship. These were objects that no matter what shape they were, they shouldn't have been there. So they were objects off the aft or the tail of USS Russell and he used a night vision PBS 14 to film through.

I didn't call these UAP. Your government did. I did not call them triangle by angle of observation, pyramid in shape. Your government did. I actually interviewed the guy who had two optical physicists look at this. And that's what they said. So I reported the news. And what people do with that, that's up to them.

SHANE SMITH: Yeah, sure, I get it. So this is the largest UFO.

JEREMY CORBELL: This one blew me the f* away.

SHANE SMITH: Right.

The Mosul Orb and Military UAP Documentation


JEREMY CORBELL: So again, every piece of footage I put out, you're going to have alternate theories. And part of the reason I put it out is to get those theories. But our government labeled this, get this. This is my enhancement. I shouldn't even wrote that. All we did was change contrast, whatever, not creating anything new that is in my eyes, circular by angle of observation. So it could be a globe, could be a disk.

Your government labeled it UAP. This is an Air Force asset with a passive capture in thermal. So it's just up there going, and it captures this. They labeled it disk navigating through clouds. They didn't label this our secret project. They didn't label this a Chinese, a Russian.

How does this thing propel if it's indeed propelling? Right, how does it propel if it doesn't have the traditional heat signatures? Now, I'm open to other interpretation. Maybe some genius going to figure out what this is, tell our government, because to this day, this is unresolved. To them. They're like, this is a craft, it's disc shaped. Whose is it?

Now I'm not a scientist, but I've just looked at a lot of this footage. Now I got questions like anybody with a bone in their body curious about the nature of reality. Is there a part of our history and nature that we're not allowed to know?

SHANE SMITH: Yeah, well, this is, that's the bigger we're getting. We're starting small. We're getting there.

JEREMY CORBELL: I'm following your lead, brother.

SHANE SMITH: Okay, so we got the—

JEREMY CORBELL: You gave me the whiskey.

SHANE SMITH: There you go. We got the—

JEREMY CORBELL: You got my greatest hits up. I remember seeing something, I didn't laze it to see the exact how many meters it was away, but to be observing it, I'm going to say it's probably about 200 meters. I kind of seen something raise up. An object kind of come off the floor from that distance. This is weird. What the hell is? I grabbed my camera, had a little black pelican case, popped it open and started filming. So I was looking through my camera screen and seen it raise up and keep continually raising.

The Iraq Sombrero Footage


SHANE SMITH: So this is a big one, right?

JEREMY CORBELL: So why this is important is because when you look at shape like a sombrero, bro, like we don't have anything that's a camera. He's on a gunner and he's filming through the gunner optics, night vision. And the kid's talking. He tells you exactly. I interview him and put it over the footage. So he's out in, I think Iraq. And he's out there. And this is 2008.

The gimbal footage is some of the most famous UFO footage that's out there by military. Look at that shape. So that's kind of—it's crazy to me that—yeah. And he filmed it.

SHANE SMITH: Yeah.

JEREMY CORBELL: Kid smart. He knew it was important the second he saw it because you could range find.

SHANE SMITH: So he's filming it through his sights.

JEREMY CORBELL: Well, he's got a phone and he's holding it up to the camera's optic system, which is in green night vision, infrared, similar to thermal. But it's more of like you can see in the dark, right. See the clouds.

SHANE SMITH: And so this one caused a lot of—

JEREMY CORBELL: Dude, they all cause a lot of waves. Because everybody's trying to solve a puzzle and puzzles are fascinating.

SHANE SMITH: And the question is, what's the biggest one that's we're doing the Tic Tac.

The 2023 Tic Tac Encounter


JEREMY CORBELL: Well, this is—oh, this is the 2023. So this one is from 2023. So that got leaked to me and George Knapp and we produced it, put it out and one of the people that was there, you can actually hear him on the footage, was like, okay, if you guys really do have it, I'm going to tell you what happened that night. And that's that guy, Alexander Wiggins.

And look, he's an active Navy, one of the top dogs. Like he has a family. I'm like, are you sure you want to? He's like, I want to. This is important because what I saw that night is so powerful and people need to know about it. But this is a Tic Tac shaped by thermal. This gives us the idea of what Commander Fravor chased for the United States military, which was a Tic Tac shaped object that he was up close to.

As we proceeded to the west, the air controller was counting down the range to an object that we were going to and we were unaware of what we were going to see. When we arrived, the controller told us that these objects had been observed for over two weeks, coming down from over 80,000 feet, rapidly descending to 20,000 feet, hanging out for hours and then going straight back up. For those who don't realize above 80,000 feet is space.

He went in front of Congress and said, we don't have that technology now. We won't have that technology in 10 years. He goes, we're not even trying to think of having that technology in 10 years. And he goes, I would know. And what people don't know is that he has a classified job right now, which would give him insight. That's why he testified to Congress. He chased a Tic Tac UFO.

As we pulled nose onto the object, within about a half mile of it, it rapidly accelerated in front of us and disappeared. Our wingman roughly 8,000 feet above us lost contact also. We immediately turned back to see where the Whitewater was at and it was gone also. So as you started to turn back towards the east, the controller came up and said, “Sir, you're not going to believe this, but that thing is at your cat point roughly 60 miles away.”

In less than a minute you can calculate the speed. We returned to Nimitz. We were taking off our gear, we were talking to one of my crews who was getting ready to launch. We mentioned it to them and they went out and luckily got in the video that you see, that 90 second video, what you don't see is the radar tape that was never released and we don't know where it's at of the act of jamming that the object put on an APJ.

Ryan Graves and Aviation Safety


SHANE SMITH: Now we talked to a guy who's in the Navy, Ryan Graves.

JEREMY CORBELL: Ryan Graves was the guy from the Red Rippers, I think. Here we go.

SHANE SMITH: Ryan Graves, former lieutenant and fighter pilot in the U.S. Navy. You're the first active duty pilot to come forward publicly about sightings of Unidentified aerial phenomenon, or UAPs.

JEREMY CORBELL: This disturbing pattern of incursions that are similar in nature over a multi year period that seem to be growing in scale and concern, frankly. I mean, after a while and you hear hundreds of reports from professionals, from elected politicians, from others that just say, I've never seen anything like this. It kind of looked like a plane. It didn't. But the way it was moving altitudes, the way they're operating together, just not like anything I've seen. It's hard to discount that information.

So he's a good dude. So basically he's come out and said, look, this is an aviation safety issue. If not, if nothing else, my boys are out there. And every single day. So Ryan never saw one, he chased one. We tried to go after. He couldn't see it with his eyes. But they get him on radar, they're very solid. And they were behaving almost like an aircraft. Right. They were stationary in the air in high winds at various altitudes.

SHANE SMITH: They were sometimes a circular pattern, sometimes in what we call a racetrack pattern.

JEREMY CORBELL: One of these objects went right in between two fighters that were about 150 feet apart, came within about 50 feet of the lead aircraft, went down their right side. Pilot weapon system officer gained a visual sighting of it. They ended up canceling their flight, returning home. And that's when I met him in the ready room.

SHANE SMITH: And he just had this look of shock on his face.

JEREMY CORBELL: His mouth was hanging open, and he's like, “I almost hit one of those damn things.”

SHANE SMITH: What did it look like? Simple description.

JEREMY CORBELL: He said it looked like a dark gray or a black cube inside of a clear sphere. Wow. About 5 to 15 feet in diameter. Every damn day, they're seeing cubes with spherical auras. And it's not just perplexing because they're on mission. It's a safety of flight issue because one came right between two planes going, you get a collision going 500 miles an hour, you're man doesn't matter if it's a seagull. Right?

So Ryan Graves did testify to Congress that, look, this is a safety of flight issue. So if nothing else, if you don't want to talk about UFOs, we got to talk about that.

SHANE SMITH: That's right.

JEREMY CORBELL: So that's why I love what Ryan does, is he's bringing it to brass tacks.

SHANE SMITH: Well, he's also, like, he's a naval pilot, and he's out there. His wing saw it. They also, they reported it.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah, yeah. Now, he tried to go after one. One time I asked him, he tried to go after him. He couldn't optically see it, just on the radar. Sometimes you don't see him visually.

Lightning Round: UFO Disclosure Predictions


SHANE SMITH: Hello, Bango, and welcome to our BET MGM Lightning round with Jeremy Corbell. All right, we're here. The man, the machine, Jeremy Corbell. Let's do a lightning round. What's the over under on the US government admitting that they actually have a UFO in storage by 2026?

JEREMY CORBELL: They've already admitted that on my show, Weaponized, the head of the DIA UFO program already admitted that we had one UAP and we've breached the whole Albert store. I'd say that's 100% because it's already done been admitted.

SHANE SMITH: Okay, let's make it simple. If Earth is Vegas and UFO sightings are the games, how many points would you spot the skeptics versus the believers?

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah. So both can be equally out of this world. They have a fervent belief. But when you talk about debunkers compared to people that actually research it, I would say the debunkers have lost incredibly, because the preposterous preponderance of evidence that has been collected and looked at even by our own government is so high. Big time losers. I won't call them skeptics, but debunkers.

SHANE SMITH: If you had to make a bet on which country comes clean about UFOs, US, Russia or China. Where are you putting your chips?

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah, actually we got really close to the Five Eyes alliance through Canada. They actually wrote a document saying we need to get ahead of this or our population will no longer trust us. So I'd go out of left field here and I'd say we might learn about this from one of the Five Eyes countries. And I would say that's most likely going to be the most honest, which is Canada.

SHANE SMITH: I like it.

JEREMY CORBELL: The US is going to come in and control the narrative.

SHANE SMITH: I like it. I like going off piste, as they say. And it's Canada for the win. The nice Canadians are going to let the cat out of the bag. Thanks for taking the time. Really appreciate it. Bazango.

JEREMY CORBELL: I love it.

Congressional Hearings and Government Response


SHANE SMITH: Well, I used to say bango and then I got bored. So now I say bazango. We got a lot of military footage now and we have a lot of military people there. They're testifying and one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to you is it seems like for the last few years anyways, there's been sort of more of a fever pitch. Like something's going to break. Like, something's coming in the community.

JEREMY CORBELL: People, something's coming, something's coming.

SHANE SMITH: And it seems like it's gone from fringe. And I remember talking to a bunch of people and then there was going to be this Congress and congressional hearings and we had multiple. And so you talked about the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office or ARROW. And so this comes out and they say, yeah, no, there's nothing to see here. What?

JEREMY CORBELL: They didn't quite say that.

SHANE SMITH: Well, what did they say?

JEREMY CORBELL: Okay, so as a journalist, it's the paper trail. If you ask George Knapp, who's been doing this 40 years. That's why you know about Area 51, Bob Lazar, flying saucers. It's the paper trail. He was lied to and he knew he was lied to and that pisses off anybody. If you're lied to. The UFO thing you've been lied to about, I don't know what it is ultimately, but I know you've been lied to.

So similarly, for me, my entry point, my gateway drug was that, well, if Bob Lazar's telling the truth. Bob Lazar claims our government captured alien spaceships, UFOs and keeps them in a secret warehouse.

The Reality of UFO Disclosure


SHANE SMITH: They are actively and have in their possession alien spacecraft, and they are actively undergoing analysis.

JEREMY CORBELL: The distance doesn't matter anymore if they have a different propulsion system. Million years ahead of us in physics, let's say. Then if they're out there, which everybody agrees with, right. The universe is teeming with sun. Just look up at the stars. Every star is a sun with orbiting planets. Probably in the Goldilocks zone.

So if there's life out there, because we ain't that special, are they coming here? That's where the conversation has now turned, and I think that's what you're feeling, is that we're realizing we don't know everything. And it's possible there are things in physics and science and nature that we are discovering, right?

So the question is, whose machines are these? Now when you kind of back up a little bit and you look at this and you say, okay, I don't know everything, it's possible, then you come into the just conflicted reality that UFOs are not in movies and magazines and popular thought and pop culture because we created that idea. They're there because people are seeing them.

They've been seeing them a long time. It's part of every single culture on every single planet, homogenous around the world. I don't know a single person who at least doesn't know somebody who's had some sort of unidentified sighting. So the elephant in the room is that our government didn't say “nothing to see here, move on” this time.

SHANE SMITH: And that's what are they saying.

JEREMY CORBELL: What they admitted is that UFOs are real. That there are craft that do things that we can't explain, that we need. Like an alcoholic, you need to admit there's a problem before you can start working on a solution. They've admitted UFOs are real.

Officially, our government has told you UFOs are real, that we don't know how or who we have suspect how they might operate, but we don't know who's operating them. So everybody's done been told, but they didn't hear it. That is official, but that's where it stops. They don't want you asking any more questions. And I know that because we have fought tooth and nail.

SHANE SMITH: But why? Why don't they want us to? It doesn't make sense.

JEREMY CORBELL: Now it does make perfect sense once you hear the answer.

SHANE SMITH: Tell me why.

Strategic Advantage and Cold War Secrecy


JEREMY CORBELL: Originally, back in the nuclear time, it was for strategic advantage. If you can get derivative exploitative technology. So if you can exploit. Well, almost there. If you can exploit any technologies for derivative technologies, just like how Russia will take and back engineer one of our bombers and figure it out, right then you have a strategic advantage.

So I get it back in the day, why they didn't want us to know about this is because they thought, and this is documented during the Cold War. Well, they thought, first people would go crazy. Then that's been debunked. Like the War of the Worlds thing. Nobody went crazy for that. Nobody went wild.

Then they're like, maybe it'll upturn people's religious ideas. And they realized, no, it won't. Most religions are like inclusive of all of God's creations. So then they thought, well, this is really important. If we can get derivative technologies through exploitation of these craft, then we would have a strategic advantage. And whoever gets there first, they win.

Because it's clear that these craft are operating off of a propulsion and energy system that is different than what we have as far as reactionary propulsion. So that I understand. I understand that back in the 40s, 50s and 60s, that we needed to protect that information to exploit the actual craft and actual hardware and the propulsion systems that we have obtained, which we have.

And you've been told by people in position to know very publicly even the number of craft in the US that.

SHANE SMITH: They believe we have the nine, the bubbles are.

JEREMY CORBELL: Well, there's several, actually. Nine flying saucers, flying disks that are out there of extraterrestrial origin. That's different. See, people don't trust Bob, except everything that he said is now becoming fact. That's weird. He must be the luckiest liar I've ever met.

SHANE SMITH: What facts? For example, you're obviously, you know, knee deep in the weeds, but for layman's.

JEREMY CORBELL: Dude, I'm deep in the weeds. Or above.

Bob Lazar and Area 51


SHANE SMITH: Bob Lazar, famous for. He. He worked at.

JEREMY CORBELL: Bob Lazar, worked at Area 51, a sub site called S4. Site 4. He claimed there were nine flying disc and that he was working on one of them. And he was actually able to enter it at one time to see what it was. And that's when he dawned on him it was not ours because the seats were too small.

SHANE SMITH: They were first and one half the size and also the propulsion system.

JEREMY CORBELL: Right, right. And so that's a complex briar patch of a story. But all you got to know is you don't got to trust Bob Lazar to know the truth about UFOs, although you should. Because he's trustworthy and he told you the truth as it happened. But I'm the guy that made the movie on him and knows him as a friend.

SHANE SMITH: So you made a doc. Yeah, made a documentary on him and then where the hell is Barry?

JEREMY CORBELL: It's a great question.

SHANE SMITH: Where is Barry?

JEREMY CORBELL: How did you jump from I want to know about UFOs to Where's Barry? Because that's a great question. And, and George Knapp and I think that we found Barry a couple times and wasn't sure we did. And now Barry be maybe dead, we don't know.

Dennis, his boss, when he, Bob Lazar, famously went on the news, it was hilarious. He called himself Dennis as a pseudonym. This is like a you to his boss. Because if you know Bob, you know that's how he rolls, right? D*mn. I don't know if he regrets that now because his life got turned upside down.

Here's a guy who never ever benefited from telling his story. It only hurt him. And I know his family, so I know that to be true. So if he's the luckiest liar I ever met, or he's absolutely told you how it happened. But that's for you to decide, not me. But if you trust anything I have to say, I believe Bob with all of my heart and all my mind.

And so here we go, big picture. Let's just step back one second here. What Bob Lazar told you is that the government had flying saucers. They were all weird shaped though that he worked on one that they couldn't make progress. That every day going to work was like working on a nuclear reactor from like some other country. And you have no idea how it works. It was scary to him.

SHANE SMITH: Yeah.

Congressional Testimony and Biologics


JEREMY CORBELL: Turns out that in Congress under oath, people were raising their hand and they were saying we have a reverse engineering program for UFOs. There are biologics inside some of those crash retrievals. But I'm not going to call them necessarily crash retrievals because some of them seem more like gifts. Bob even said that one of them he believes was from an archeological dig.

It doesn't matter. You've been told now that we have these programs to exploit the technologies and there are biologics on the craft and. And Bob happened to say 9. It's really funny because just recently, Hal Puthoff, who's a man who's been involved with all these programs, he goes, “if I told you everything, they'd kill me.” He said, “I can't.”

It's a very serious scientist that worked on all these black projects, renowned in the scientific community. He was at SRI Stanford Research Institute studying Uri Geller and psychic phenomenon. Anything weird, you call Hal, Puthoff, right? So this is a guy that has impeccable credentials working for our intelligence agencies on this stuff.

And he straight said the number that he's pretty sure the United States has, I think is wrong. I think we have more. But that's where Bob, what he said just keeps hitting you in the face. Because what he said ends up being where we are now. There are nine UFOs that that office has helped with going out and retrieving, and that two of them are actually intact craft.

SHANE SMITH: When the door was open and I went into the main hangar, I could see there were other hangars as I.

JEREMY CORBELL: Walked by, and they went pretty far down.

SHANE SMITH: I could clearly see two craft in there.

JEREMY CORBELL: And we all want to believe. Actually, not me. A lot of people want to believe in UFOs, but UFOs are not a matter of belief.

The Biggest Story Ever


SHANE SMITH: Well, here's my problem with it is if. So we have UFOs and we reverse engineer the technology. So we're like, okay, like, how can we, you know, let's Cold War. Okay, let's follow that trajectory. So we say we've got some technology we want to reverse engineer so we can have an advantage against the Soviet.

JEREMY CORBELL: That's the old school thought of secrecy.

SHANE SMITH: Yeah, but I'm like, okay, I get that, and I understand that, but this would literally be the biggest story ever.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yes, sir.

SHANE SMITH: Ever. So I don't even care necessarily so much about the UAPs or the UFOs or anything. That's just a physical manifestation of, hey, hold on a second. We're not alone. What is. Where are they from? What's the. What has been, the interaction? Is that religion? Is it not. Is it part of religion is, you know, all of these questions that we have, you know, humanity.

I mean, that's why to me. And it's quite a large question in that, okay, if we have these things or we're looking to solve these things, that's actually the tip of the iceberg to a much bigger. And this is what I want to say, there's a much bigger philosophical question of what does that mean for everything?

You know, so for me, all of these things that we're finding out now, like dark matter, dark energy, weakly interacting molecular particles, all this stuff. So obviously a lot of these things are coming out now. So science, physics is being sort of turned on its ear and we have since Snowden and you know, we have whistleblowers are, are not necessarily a bad thing.

So, you know, more people are coming, military people. And so, so for me, and this is why I wanted to talk to you today, is. And I just wanted to get some of the, the mechanics of it down. But okay, if to go back to the government, whoever breaks this story by whoever gets there first, for example, not.

JEREMY CORBELL: Break the story if they crack the technology.

SHANE SMITH: Crack the technology, material science, but also break the story of, hey, we found or they gave it to us or we found it or we're friends or we know it.

JEREMY CORBELL: The story doesn't been broken by who, it's already been done. See, people, if you don't know that, you haven't been paying attention. But I understand, but I don't know.

SHANE SMITH: That because it hasn't been unequivocally proved. Because if I knew, we wouldn't be happy having this discussion.

The Barometer of Truth


JEREMY CORBELL: So what's your barometer for truth? Like, do you need to walk into an. I'll just say a craft that can travel in space, not made by humans. That's why they changed you to remember UFO, UAP. It's no longer aliens. They call them NHI. Non Human Intelligence, which is way better. You know, it's smart.

It was, it was listed like 27 times in congressional in a senatorial legislation called the Disclosure Act, where they're trying to pry the technology out of the hands of like Lockheed Martin who are unfairly given the contracts for these things because there was no process of letting other people bid on, can I work on this. Because they wanted to hide them in black budget programs. That's proven fact, what I just told you so. And I can get you there if you got a couple hours and a few more. Keep going.

SHANE SMITH: Yeah, go.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah. I'm just saying. But like, your point is very fair. I do like your problem, as you said, because you jumped from, you know, the star, the sand of the stars. You were like, okay, okay, but what if it's true? I should know about it.

SHANE SMITH: Well, if it's true, it means so much more is what I'm saying.

JEREMY CORBELL: What is your barometer of proof? Like, I know it's different for everybody and for me there were some real solid hard lines of like, I need to know if I'm wasting my life. And it started with me with seeing the lies. And I have gone high up the food chain as high as I can imagine at this point, which is. I'm trying to reimagine things.

When you get to people who actually physically worked on these non human intelligence craft and they're thinking about coming forward to testify in front of Congress at their own detriment, that is real. Those conversations are happening. And so that's kind of where we're at is what is proof for the world?

SHANE SMITH: Okay, I'll tell you what proof is. So there's not that much difference between. This is where we went through the, the video footage and like the, you know, in the 50s and the 60s and the 70s, it's like a thing and it's an orb and it moves and it's weird and you know, it hasn't changed that much, right?

JEREMY CORBELL: The UFO phenomenon?

SHANE SMITH: No, no, just the footage is never like, wow, there it is.

JEREMY CORBELL: I disagree.

SHANE SMITH: Okay, well that's. But I'm just, I'm a layman. You're an expert.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah, no, people say I'm a great. I'm not being aggressive.

SHANE SMITH: No, no. I'm just talking about proof.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah.

The Question of Proof


SHANE SMITH: So proof. You want some unequivocal. The other thing would be okay, if they do have. Let's see the machines. Let's see these things. Yes, A and then B. Okay, if there are so called biologics or whatever, this is the biggest story. This is humanity now.

And also you know, we have these things where we're okay, we're going to release the JFK things. We're going to release the things. We're going to release all this footage. We're going to put people.

JEREMY CORBELL: How's that worked out?

SHANE SMITH: Yeah, exactly. So. But it's since whoever JFK till now, that means every president, every national security advisor.

JEREMY CORBELL: Okay, so not every president is told the same amount of information. I know that for a fact. I know people that has brief precedence on that.

SHANE SMITH: So that's the whole thing. Like the amount of. If it's the biggest story ever, right?

JEREMY CORBELL: Yes, it is.

SHANE SMITH: Then the amount of people that know about the biggest story ever. And the only guy we've got is Bob Lazar.

JEREMY CORBELL: Sort of. No, you got tons of people. You have directors of national security coming out and admitting that we don't know what these are. So that's the thing. I think it takes like a kind of critical mass of information, you know, videos and everything I'm doing in journalism. It's glitter. It's glitter around the big.

SHANE SMITH: But it's all we had. This is you're providing the proof. It's all we have now. And so correct me if I'm wrong, but you're trying to use investigative journalism to force them to tell us the truth so that we have the proof. So that we can sit here and say, okay, now we saw the machines and now this means. Because what's the next step? And the next step and the next step.

Using Journalism to Force Accountability


JEREMY CORBELL: I'm not trying to force them. I'm trying to force us because we have representative government. Man, these people have been hiding this and holding it so tightly. And unless somebody gives me a good reason, I'm not stopping.

But yeah, we're trying to use investigative journalism to poke holes to, to show. Either hold them accountable or show how they lied. It's one or the other. And so, yeah, that is part of the mission, you know, is to.

SHANE SMITH: Is the end of your mission, if you will, would be okay, they open up Area 51 and we see the nine.

JEREMY CORBELL: No, there are secrets that should stay there for national security. Yeah, absolutely we should. Secrets are kept and they should be kept, but not about nature and the fundamental reality that we live in.

Like, for example, to give you a hardcore example, we all know that there's nuclear science. We do not know how to make a nuclear bomb at home in our living room. Fine. You've admitted that atomic bombs exist. You've admitted that we know how to make them. You've also admitted that there's a whole element of science dedicated to nuclear science. That doesn't mean you're giving people the codes to how to make nuclear weapons.

So same thing you said. Area 51 is. Sure, there's tons of stuff that should remain secret, but the fundamental essence of it is nobody's right to hold that back from humankind. If we're not alone in the universe, it's the biggest story of all time.

Even if they're from here originally, just from a long time ago, if that ends up being what it is and it's not something bigger than my head, like interdimensional, I can't even live in this dimension. I don't know the ultimate reality. There's extraterrestrial, extra temporal, interdimensional, ultra terrestrial. Meaning they're from here. I don't care what I. I don't care about the nuclear.

SHANE SMITH: Sorry, sorry. What's ultra terrestrial?

JEREMY CORBELL: That's like they're from here. They just predate us, right? Or like a time or they live here or. Yeah, maybe a long time. Civilization, breakaway civilization. Ultra terrestrial. But you know, the thing is too, they could just be here as like a waypoint man.

Non-Human Intelligence


SHANE SMITH: Yeah, well, so again there's a million questions. If in fact you go with the hypothesis. Okay. If there are machines, if there are, if there is technology which you're taking as a given.

JEREMY CORBELL: No, I'm not taking as given. I know it's true.

SHANE SMITH: Okay, so if that's true then obviously there's. What is it called? Non Human intelligence.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah. NHI is the new hip term.

SHANE SMITH: So then there's NHIs. Now that is just the beginning. It is, that's the springboard into all of these.

JEREMY CORBELL: That's right.

SHANE SMITH: Discussions. So for me, which is why I want, I'm going to be honest with you, I have two reasons.

JEREMY CORBELL: Please always be honest.

SHANE SMITH: Because if in the near future the story breaks, it's the biggest story in the world, which means you've worked on a long time. But I'm going to have this in the game. So we'll be part of the biggest story ever breaking. So we're, we're following, we're following it down just like we'd follow any other story. And if it is the biggest story in the history of humanity, we'll tell the next story we want to get into piece of it.

Now that's A and so a B just philosophically it brings up a lot of questions which I'm interested in and there's a lot of knock on things, for example government, FOIA, what's true, what's not true, you know, what are they keeping? If they are keeping, what are they keeping them for what reason?

JEREMY CORBELL: The DOJ does not like what I do for a living.

The Bob Lazar Story


SHANE SMITH: Maybe let's go to that. Because you did the, you did the documentary what happened to Bob Lazar with that sort of fallout of he started talking and then there was theoretically some, you know, government pushback or whatever.

JEREMY CORBELL: I feel like the least qualified person to be in the position that I'm in. When it comes to journalism, I feel like Inspector Clouseau. Is that the funny French dude? Yeah, yeah, yeah, more handsome.

But like, what happened with that was George Knapp, investigative reporter out of Las Vegas. Didn't have somebody to fill the time slot.

SHANE SMITH: Who among us has not heard about an alleged UFO cover up? I saw that footage. So she got him in the van.

JEREMY CORBELL: Just did a blur out of his.

SHANE SMITH: Face because he didn't.

JEREMY CORBELL: He was already under threat. The reason he did that was for self protection. The man that put him in that car was John Lear. He was like, dude, you got to come forward.

SHANE SMITH: So he was doing that. So if you correct me if I'm wrong, so that he could have it out there so no one would kill him because he.

JEREMY CORBELL: He was literally fearing for his life because of what he says happened to him. That we verified a lot of. He was fearing for his life. George unknowingly, you know, said the guy, John Lear, had some trust with George because he had talked to George's mentor about the stealth fighter, and he was right about it. At 51, John Lear was like the Godfather.

SHANE SMITH: The existence of the stealth fighter or the development.

JEREMY CORBELL: John Lear's dad was William P. Lear, inventor of the Learjet, the eight track stereo. You know, he was like, really up there in the echelon. So everybody revered John. He flew all these CIA flights.

So people were like, John would come in and talk about things that actually were true out at Area 51, and they're like, cool. So when he came and talked about this, George sees him, you know, budding journalist at the time. He goes, oh, look at those. I'll listen to that. He looks into it.

That's kind of how it all started. Was he called John and goes, hey, you got that guy that might want to break from the fold from 51 and maybe go on camera, you know, just shot in the dark. John's like, yeah, yeah, no problem. Come on over.

SHANE SMITH: It wasn't like he was chasing Lazar.

JEREMY CORBELL: No, he didn't. He literally had somebody drop out of his show and like in real time had to.

SHANE SMITH: Which is kind of interesting because in the documentary it sort of feels that way. Like, we just got this guy, we did it. And then he's like, then it got picked up all over the world by DED Baron News saying then it became a big news story tonight.

JEREMY CORBELL: It's a chilling scenario with worldwide implications that may have its roots right here. This week, we've heard the contention of.

SHANE SMITH: UFO researchers that there is a secret.

JEREMY CORBELL: Government within our Government and George Diario take this seriously. And then he dug in. Bob.

SHANE SMITH: Yeah.

JEREMY CORBELL: Lying piece of. Or is he telling the truth? Turns out he's telling the truth. That's what George came to.

Evaluating Lazar's Claims


SHANE SMITH: What I find interesting about it is I have two minds of it when he throws away stuff. Well, then we walk in, and on the right, there's the gray thing, and on the right, there's the orange thing. Like, it was pretty involved, like. So it just says throwaway facts.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah. Oh, yeah. The way he told Bob's ark, told what happened to him.

SHANE SMITH: Yeah, yeah.

JEREMY CORBELL: He had a lot of detail.

SHANE SMITH: Yeah, a lot of detail that rings true. But then, like. And especially on the Rogan thing, it'd be like, whoa, what's that? Well, I don't remember.

JEREMY CORBELL: Have you ever asked anyone where they.

SHANE SMITH: Got him or how they got him?

JEREMY CORBELL: No, but something must have been said to me, but it was just too long ago.

SHANE SMITH: And I can't quite remember what was.

JEREMY CORBELL: Said, but it just left a seed in my mind.

SHANE SMITH: I think at least one of them was part of an archaeological dig.

JEREMY CORBELL: You got to understand Bob. How many years ago? 35. By the time I got him on that show with Rogan. First of all, it was not easy. Like, Bob didn't want to come forward. I convinced him. I honestly convinced him that everybody's going to make up lies about him and that that will be his history unless he talked for himself.

It's like getting the Bigfoot on camera, right? Like, he had not gone on camera except these tiny little snippets with George, out of loyalty, for, like, 35 years to finally get him and make a documentary. He didn't get from my documentary. He just got grief.

SHANE SMITH: I don't like being in the public eye.

JEREMY CORBELL: I don't have money for doing this. I don't. And quite frankly, I could make up.

SHANE SMITH: A better lie, but I have no motivation to lie.

JEREMY CORBELL: And so it was like, the fact he did it, I was, like, really proud of him as a human being to put himself back out there. There's a new thing they're making on him where they replicate the whole thing that he saw. Because everybody wants to know, but what did it really look like?

So he. Hopefully for him, hopefully he gets something out of it. But, like, you know, this his life story. But, like, they're finally going to show you what it looks like in the hangar.

But, yeah, look, man, if we're sitting here and you think you're going to get to the bottom of UFOs by figuring out if Bob Lazar is telling the truth, then you're as lost as I was back then. It's not going to teach you anything.

SHANE SMITH: I'm just, I'm just starting at the beginning.

JEREMY CORBELL: This is Shane asks questions.

SHANE SMITH: That's right. So I was starting at the beginning. So you get into it, right, by making the movie about that.

The Bob Lazar Story and Finding a Passport to Truth


JEREMY CORBELL: Can I tell you that story? I heard Bob Lazar on the radio and it was George Knapp and he is talking about propulsion and he's saying that it's a gravity well. These things are propelled by gravity and a thing called element 115, which we believe is correct. He's not sure on everything but that it falls into space time.

And I thought, how weird. I'm 13 year old idiot kid, right? I listen to Metallica. I don't give a f* about this stuff. I hear him explain it and it's like, wait a second. So something. I was doing jiu jitsu, right? So I knew a little bit about mechanics. It falls into place. I'm like, that's weird. It flipped my script.

I was like, wait a second. If that's true, then points in space and time are connected. And it doesn't take light speed and thousands of years to get somewhere. It's instantaneous. And I go, I want to know if that's true. But I'm 13 years old and I don't know anybody and what the hell?

So I went off and started doing jiu jitsu and all this other. And then I kind of came back to it and I was like, I really want to know if that guy's telling the truth. He's been consistent now for like 20, 30 years. I'm like, what's going on? But there's no way. How do I get to someone like that? There's no way.

But then I grabbed somebody, gave me one of these cameras, just a little Canon 5D. First person I pointed it at, they spilled the beans about, they didn't even tell their wife about. And I'm like, this is my passport into my curiousness. This is what I can do. It is my passport.

So I would point that at people and tell them, yeah, I'm going to make a movie. I've never made a movie in my life, making a film. And they'd start spilling and then I think I'm charming. So what would happen is people would continue to talk with me.

And over years I started filming this guy John Lear and George Knapp got wind of it. And then one day he called me back after two years of me leaving messages for him at his news station and emailing him in Vegas, and it was like the longest pause in telephone history. I think he was eating a sandwich.

But he gave me his time, and he told me, and I was like, okay, I'm genuine. I'm not trying to hurt anybody. I just want to know. That's how I got started with George Knapp. Gave me a chance. He gave me a chance, even though I was not a journalist at the time. He's been mentoring me in journalism for 11, 12 years now. And so that was the entry point.

And each time I earned some trust, they spread that around. So you get to Commander Fravor, the most famous UFO case of all time. Now it's 2004 Tic Tac. There's this bearded, tattooed guy that calls him up from the desert, and I'm like, “Hey, man, I heard from a friend that you chased the UFO.”

“Who are you? How did you hear that? What are you talking about?” I mean, I got coaching from my friends how to speak pilot before I called him. I'm not that dumb, right? So I earned his trust. And when I kept his trust and didn't break the story, although we did kind of break it twice on a radio show with his permission to a degree. Didn't put his name or face out there.

And I called him, I said, “You're on the news. I told you your story was important, and it's never going away, and it's coming out with or without me.”

SHANE SMITH: This is the story of the Tic Tac.

JEREMY CORBELL: Commander David Fravor, who's a good friend of mine, right? So I think when I didn't break his trust, because apparently I'm the only person that keeps their mouth shut when you ask them to. And that's a super talent. And I didn't know that. I did that for him because I promised him. And that spread around.

And so all those things compiled, all of a sudden, people tell me more than I want to know, and they tell me I shouldn't know. And I report on 1% of it.

SHANE SMITH: How do you sit on all this stuff?

JEREMY CORBELL: Clearly, I'm a relaxed person. That's what I remember about you. The first time I met you, you had a laugh, man. You came in like you had something around your neck like a big piece of jewelry. You walk into Vice like this, and you laughed, like, loud. I was like, that guy's having a good time.

SHANE SMITH: Life is good.

JEREMY CORBELL: Life is good.

SHANE SMITH: Life is good. Especially if we can break the story.

JEREMY CORBELL: We're not going to break it, man. Come on. We're not going to break it.

SHANE SMITH: Why?

JEREMY CORBELL: Because the opposition to this, if there's…

The Push for Disclosure


SHANE SMITH: But if there's evidence out there, preposterous preponderance. If there's actual technology, machines, whatever you want to call them, they're not going…

JEREMY CORBELL: To let us in, bro.

SHANE SMITH: But we've reached a time when, you know, keeping these, okay, maybe in the 50s and the 60s, during the Cold War and the army and everything, but we've reached a time when it's, if it's going to hold, it's not going to hold much longer.

JEREMY CORBELL: You hear that, everybody? I'm talking right to the camera. It ain't going to hold. Shane said so. I agree. Let the information out.

SHANE SMITH: Let the information out.

JEREMY CORBELL: There's a nuclear program, right? We know about nukes. UFOs are real. There are non human intelligence engaging humanity on a regular basis, durationally. Okay, we can handle it.

SHANE SMITH: Well, we have to get the sort of unequivocal proof whether we beat the government at their own game, which is doable.

JEREMY CORBELL: I'm not against them. I'm not. I want to work with them. I do, because…

SHANE SMITH: But hold on. But they've proven themselves. If we follow the logic path, they've proven themselves adversarial.

JEREMY CORBELL: Who are they? So I know a lot of people in government that are fighting with me to get this information out. That is 90% of my experience.

SHANE SMITH: Well, obviously they're fighting against someone who's keeping the information in.

JEREMY CORBELL: That's true. But it's a very small minority of people with great power and responsibility, but power. So I mean, I'm kind of making fun as we're joking, like I want it broken too. Yes, this is the biggest story. I happen to know it's true. And yeah, that is. That eats me inside at night.

But I have a dog, I have a wife, I have a family, I have a good life. It's not going to kill me if the story doesn't break, and I'm certainly the wrong messenger to break it. There are people that are better suited to tell you what's going on. It's not my responsibility either.

But I just feel like if anybody takes as much time to look at this issue that they do on simply looking at hairstyles on Instagram, then they're going to know that this is true and they're going to demand the answers because, and this is part, this is the part where we get serious.

You will see my day to day soon because my best weapon was my camera and letting somebody film me through these moments that were harder. You'll see me at my worst point, that's coming out and I'm okay with that because I want people to see. But if you can kind of see this…

SHANE SMITH: So this is like a documentary or…

Recording Everything: A Defense Strategy


JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah. I shouldn't say anything, but you know, this kid's been like, when I was going through some of the threats that I have received when I had been going through hard times like that, the only defense I had was to record everything. Wired up all the time, everything's filmed.

And you're going to see that. You're going to see it, how it really happened. And I'm happy about that because then people will have a level of trust that I think is necessary for this conversation. We have to have trust.

There's a lot of crazy people when it comes into government and it comes into this thing because it triggers this shielding into religion or this triggers this shielding into, “I'm smarter, I'm scared of the unknown.” So there's this whole thing that happens existentially. You get what I call ontological shock. I look up the word, I believe I'm correct. Ontological shock, the existence of being. I think that word means. So that happens to people.

But I told you I'm going to get serious. So let me get serious for a second. What I do not as a journalist is I have facilitated whistleblowers, government employees who have had repercussions due to sometimes accidental spillage to the UAP topic. So they're inside their government office, they see something they shouldn't.

What has happened to some of these people is criminal, 100% provable in the court of law, it's criminal. And you will see that it will be reported on. And everybody can be judge, jury and executioner. That's up to them. I'm going to report the news though.

So that has happened to too many people. So here's the deal. Whistleblowers come to me or I find them. Half of what I do is putting together people that say, “I'll protect you,” and people that say, “I've had an experience that I believe.” And you will see that in Congress, if they have courage and they do their job and I will supply them.

Those whistleblowers who are government vetted four years by me and George Knapp. This is not casual. I know what they drink. I know who they hang with. I know where they worked and I verified it with people on the inside and sources that I've never heard.

SHANE SMITH: Who's the biggest whistleblower so far right now? So far?

David Grusch: The Biggest Whistleblower


JEREMY CORBELL: David Grusch. “Mr. Grusch, as a result of your previous government work, have you met with people with direct knowledge or have direct knowledge yourself of non human origin craft?”

SHANE SMITH: “Yes, I personally interviewed those individuals.” So give me his story.

JEREMY CORBELL: David Grusch came to me and George Knapp at a bar. Like all good stories start, it was a spook bar and it was for a UAP related thing. And he handed George Knapp, trusted journalist, his ICIG complaint, Intelligence Community Inspector General complaint before he submitted it, I believe, or maybe after he submitted it. He wanted journalists to know that could shield him.

Inspector General means like the police of…

SHANE SMITH: So the police of the intelligence community.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah. I hope we get a good new one, by the way. But anyway, they deemed his report credible and urgent. Inspector General then he was tasked as a veteran and an intelligence officer. He was tasked by the UAPTF, run by a great guy named Jay Stratton, who ran the UFO program that part. UAPTF. UAP Task Force.

SHANE SMITH: For who?

JEREMY CORBELL: For our DOD. But he was transparent.

SHANE SMITH: He's a government employee.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah, he was. And he was transparent as best he could with the American public. I really admire him for that. People have all these opinions on who's spooks, who's not spooks. They think I'm CIA, where's my paycheck? All I get is grief.

So here's the deal. David Grusch, he does his ICIG complaint. He was who he said he was. He was in the positions. He said he was specifically tasked by the UAP task force and Jay Stratton to investigate the black budget programs that deal with UFOs and non human intelligence and tell us are they hiding?

And he did. And he hit paydirt. And he did everything he could to tell what was going on internally as an intelligence agent. And it's his story to tell, but it didn't go well. So he did a complaint like going to the police in HR. And this is really serious.

SHANE SMITH: And they said, “I did my job, I did what I was supposed to do,” and now I'm…

JEREMY CORBELL: So I'm going to make a complaint and this is the paperwork that…

SHANE SMITH: Yeah, but he's a fastidious mother, right? So he didn't just make a complaint. He brought in 40 witnesses and he had them also testify under oath to all of them and give written statements and verbal statements, recorded statements, people that worked in these UFO programs. So that's his move. He's a gangster, right? You don't. David Grusch.

SHANE SMITH: What was the reaction?

JEREMY CORBELL: Well, it's a mixed bag, isn't it now? Because what's happened is he came forward and finally with me and George, we're kind of guiding him. “Hey, we've been down this road, like, be careful of this. We know some people. Let's talk about this. Let's get you out in front so it's harder to hurt you.”

And it worked well. And there he is like this, testifying to Congress. To his left was Commander David Fravor, the guy that chased the UFO.

SHANE SMITH: So what did they say?

David Grush's Testimony on Crash Retrievals


JEREMY CORBELL: So David Grush said, “I uncovered the fact that the United States government with other nations, I read into the programs. I can tell you everything for national security in a SCIF. But here's the basics: there are UFOs, there are non-human intelligence. We have crash retrieval programs. We've been trying to exploit the technology.”

SHANE SMITH: Crash retrieval, meaning if a UAP crashes, we have a thing to go get it?

JEREMY CORBELL: I'm suspicious of the crash thing. I think they're more like gifts, but whatever. Yeah, crash retrievals. They crash. We jump in with different agencies and we collect up the material, we bring them over to like Battelle, BAE, Lockheed, Raytheon, whoever. And we give them a piece and say we don't know where it comes from, but want you to reverse engineer it. Whatever. That's what he's saying happens. Program names, everything.

And he goes, and by the way, somebody asked him, “Were there any beings on some of these craft?” And he says, “Yeah, some of the crafts we retrieved had biologics. Do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft?” “Biologics came with some of these recoveries.” Yeah, he didn't say beings, bodies, he said biologics. And there's a reason he said that. Well, I think you should ask Dave. He's smarter than me, but I—

SHANE SMITH: He's not here.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah, it's true.

SHANE SMITH: Keep going. Biologics. Biologics.

The Meaning of “Biologics”


JEREMY CORBELL: Biologics. I think because we make the assumption that—that's why we changed it to non-human intelligence. We make assumption extraterrestrial, alien. Well, maybe they're from here. They're ultra-terrestrials. Maybe some of these things are just like printed flesh with AI. We'd call that a biologic.

SHANE SMITH: Oh, I see.

JEREMY CORBELL: Because we do that, we print organs. So I think he's leaving the terminology open for interpretation. But what he's saying is, yeah, they're aliens and craft.

SHANE SMITH: I remember talking to Larry Page and he was saying, for space travel, it doesn't necessarily have to be—you go through these light years, for example, you can download your consciousness or brain into a computer, send that through laser beam into a clone that's already been printed out. So there are different sort of biologics.

JEREMY CORBELL: That's way above my pay grade. Can I have more whiskey?

SHANE SMITH: Sure.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I just like—I don't know, man, that's so cool. Is this what we're drinking?

SHANE SMITH: Yeah.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah. That is so cool. And I would like to be part of that future. Just the idea that we might not know everything is kind of neat, you know?

The Biggest Story in the World


SHANE SMITH: Well, that's why, like, when I say it's the biggest story, I mean, literally, it changes everything. Which is why—

JEREMY CORBELL: Agreed.

SHANE SMITH: Again, you know, I understand your points and—and again, I'm playing devil's advocate, but—

JEREMY CORBELL: So am I.

SHANE SMITH: But I'm just like, if it is the biggest story in the world, like, A, we have to break it. B, you know, that's a lot of people.

JEREMY CORBELL: Help me break it.

SHANE SMITH: I will. There's a lot of—look, that's fine.

JEREMY CORBELL: I've been alone with George Knapp so long. My hair is long, my nails are long. I don't know.

SHANE SMITH: We got to get—we got to get more and more people.

JEREMY CORBELL: How do we break the story?

SHANE SMITH: You call in people, like Snowden, and you call in people who can—who can get in there. You get some hackers. We had this guy, one of the best hackers in the world, and he can hack anything. Like, okay, let's just go talk to him.

JEREMY CORBELL: But, you know, I don't know much about politics and stuff, but I'm not playing that game. I'm not playing this roundabout stealing game. I want our government—okay? Mosul Orb. I gave that to them in 2023. And I had the video. I was like, put it out. This is your chance to show goodwill to the American public. You're not hiding. And they didn't.

I mean, not to make enemies. But they end up—there's a lot of good people that work in AARO that I know personally, that are good workers. There's a mandate from the top down to absolutely whitewash the American public. The ultimate truth. All you get to know is that UFOs are real. That's it. Don't ask another question. Don't ask about abductions. Don't ask about aliens. Don't ask about anything like that.

Government Stonewalling


SHANE SMITH: But if they say UFOs are real, then the follow-up questions—

JEREMY CORBELL: I've got a lot.

SHANE SMITH: You can't—you can't say, “Well, UFOs are real,” but then you can't ask us another question.

JEREMY CORBELL: But they just did. They did that. So this show is called Shane Asked Questions. Help me.

SHANE SMITH: Okay, what happened? So that guy, he did this thing saying when I said nothing to see here, but he didn't say okay, but he said okay, you can't ask anymore. Then they fired him or he retired him or—

JEREMY CORBELL: So David Grush. What happened was he basically, I guess you kind of resign when you leave and there's no whistleblower protections. Like he was going to make better rank and make better pay. And I think for all the whistleblowers who are about to come forward—because I've recorded with a bunch that we're going to put out if the government doesn't do its job and have them in the hearings—okay, so I think they should have protections for them.

David Grush should get back pay or whatever, like the rank pay. They have no safety net after. They're no safety net. So basically I would say I don't know if he resigned in protest like that guy, my friend Lou Elizondo did. He resigned in the head of AARO. Sean Kirkpatrick. Yeah, Dr. Sean.

SHANE SMITH: But didn't he—but didn't he just resign?

AARO's Deception


JEREMY CORBELL: Check this out. Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick. He's straight up lying to the American public. I know he's lying because I sent AARO people to testify to test them. They testified—sorry, testified before Congress to testify within the intelligence community to AARO. It's not for the public to know. This is just—people want to keep their jobs. They don't want to be known. They want to keep working.

SHANE SMITH: Right. But to give AARO the—the story.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah, the scoop. Because AARO was mandated by Congress to find the cover-up.

SHANE SMITH: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

JEREMY CORBELL: That was the whole point.

SHANE SMITH: And sorry, just why did Congress mandate them to—what mandate AARO to go—great.

JEREMY CORBELL: And this is Shane Asked Questions, man. Because there was legislation called the Disclosure Act and they laid out how to give disclosure to the American public. Like Senator Rounds and Senator Schumer, who I think was like top dog of like Democrats or something. They laid it out like you read it. It's shocking. Like if you, Lockheed, happen to have non-human technology and you're not sure how you got it anymore, you feel uncomfortable, you can come to us. We'll eminent domain that.

SHANE SMITH: So basically they knew it's out there. So they said, we're going to hire you or not hire you. We're going to put you together to do this.

JEREMY CORBELL: It wasn't written in a void, like all that legislation. But why was AARO really put together, you know, to shape the emerging UAP narrative? Those exact words, if I've ever seen those in a document, it would be to shape the emerging UAP narrative. Why you got to shape something if it's made up?

SHANE SMITH: Well, also, yeah, because it's—it's growing in popularity. And so therefore something's happening.

Shaping the UAP Narrative


JEREMY CORBELL: It's coming out to some degree. People got cell phones, people talking. People are coming forward. Whistleblowers. So, yeah, man. So Dr. Kirkpatrick, they watch all this stuff, by the way. I love it. I always get intel when people are watching stuff. AARO, when you watch this: Why are you having your former director do a PR campaign on select podcasts where you try to say you can't trust whistleblowers when you are a known liar who goes against whistleblowers? When you asked whistleblowers to come to you, why do I send you whistleblowers? As a test. And then they—

SHANE SMITH: And then they don't put out what they—

JEREMY CORBELL: And then they come back to me and I put it out. Why? Why does that happen? Why did Tim Phillips, the interim director of AARO, who's no longer any director of AARO, also going on a media tour and telling absolute lies to the American public?

Now, the new director of AARO, I hear, is a really good guy, but he did say to a friend of mine, “In fact, I can't even part my hair without getting authorization.” So even if he's a good guy, how much is he able to tell the American public that he wants to?

Now, they've admitted some good things because they have to, because we forced them, because they look like dopes when they don't. They look like dopes when people come back to me, say I testified to them and they lied. They look like dopes when they go to the Wall Street Journal and use Joel Schectman as the guy that they're going to put out false—and George and I tell Joel Schectman, “Hey, that's factually incorrect. Here's the guy that was in the nuclear bunker. You got the story wrong. Just do a correction.” And they don't. They double down and attack whistleblowers.

So AARO, I got no love for them. Now, the employees of AARO, lot of love for—good folks in there from the top down. They got a mandate, and I'm going to say it one last time, because no one ever listens to me. And I've been saying this for years. This one thing we're listening to: shape the emerging UAP narrative. That is a CIA mandate about the—yeah. About media and UFOs. They have something, by the way, that they call perception management. It's an office, and they have a budget, and that's what they're trying to do.

SHANE SMITH: Yeah. Well, I definitely believe in perception management because they try to shape political consciousness and have been since really—oh, yeah. Since World War II.

JEREMY CORBELL: I believe it.

Verifying UAP Footage


SHANE SMITH: But can you walk us through how you got the—and verified the pyramid UFO, Navy footage or the jellyfish footage?

JEREMY CORBELL: Maybe.

SHANE SMITH: What's that process look like to verify footage, how you obtain it and then verify. And then—

JEREMY CORBELL: I'm not going to tell how I obtain it, but—yeah, I'll tell you. Yeah. But I'll tell you how I verify it, because I'm very proud of this.

SHANE SMITH: Okay, good.

JEREMY CORBELL: I use something called cosmic time and good journalism, so I'm in no rush. I never need to break another story in my life. The jellyfish footage was unique because it was filmed at a base in a secret part of the base that was secretly a joint operations part of the base secretly run by the CIA. So that was weird to begin with, you know, but it's—

SHANE SMITH: This is in Iraq.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah. So that was Iraq. The jellyfish UAP. So again, I don't know what the jellyfish is. I know that our government has deemed it a UAP, and I know that the CIA came and confiscated that footage, like, even from within other government agencies. Like, so it's not just—we're not supposed to see that. Like, people in government are not supposed to see that.

So it got leaked to me and to George. And the thing is, we usually wait to get something sent to us. We never solicit. That's the law. That's the handcuff law. Right. Never solicit. But if stuff is leaked to us, we wait till end the, like two, three times before we take it seriously, because we get a lot of time.

SHANE SMITH: Right.

JEREMY CORBELL: So with the jellyfish one, that was a Rubik's Cube, man. Because the problem with that was how do you validate something that's so specific? There's only a certain number of people that rotate in and out of that base for a very short amount of time. So protect sources, especially if they don't protect themselves kind of thing. Right.

So we sat and we sat and we watched and started asking little questions, poking around. I was able, with Jordan, we showed it on an iPhone to the—at the time, I think it was the former head of one of the UFO study groups. A couple of them we showed them, said, “Have you ever seen this before?” And they were like, “No.” Like they'd seen something similar, but not that. So we're like, okay, cool.

So then finally, when we got people that were aware, very small group, you know, of that footage, we heard the whole story. What happened is they filmed this thing. They all know it's different than anything before. They get drones flying in with bombs all the time at that base, right? Just normal DJI drones.

SHANE SMITH: Very familiar with drones, bro.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah, that's their job, right? It's an aerostat.

SHANE SMITH: And it's not balloons.

JEREMY CORBELL: I can prove to you it's not balloons. I don't even want to do that right now. But yeah, it's not.

SHANE SMITH: I'm just bringing it up.

JEREMY CORBELL: No, no, it's not you. But see, that's a good question. That's the world. And it's a good question. We have to eliminate balloons. Maybe it was balloons.

SHANE SMITH: We've got to 8 Mile it. What does that mean in 8 Mile? You know, he knows what they're going to say bad things against him.

JEREMY CORBELL: Eminem.

SHANE SMITH: Eminem. He goes out there and he says, “Oh yeah, you're going to say this, and I am white, and I did do this, and you did beat me up. And I'm still here saying it.” Free Will, you get 8 Mile.

JEREMY CORBELL: You got 8 Mile. But also, because I'm interested in the truth, and sometimes the government's been wrong, right? So my reporting, if you look at it, if you just look at what I write, it's very specific, right? So yeah, you got an 8 Mile of that. But then also, you have to get—so I'm on cosmic time, and I do journalism. That's what I said to you.

SHANE SMITH: So what I do is that you search up people who are in the base. You verify. Whoa.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah, it freaks people out. About 10 of my friends have called me in the last week saying FBI's contacting them. I'm so good now. I go, “Was it Agent blah, blah, blah and blah, blah, blah?” And I just said that to a guy at NASA.

SHANE SMITH: Really?

JEREMY CORBELL: And yeah, and I can prove that to you right now, after the show. It's like, people, I am very fastidious. Actually, I'll take that word for myself. So here's the deal. We take our time. George Knapp and I take our time. We have a web and a network of sources and it pisses off agencies so much.

SHANE SMITH: No, it's your job.

JEREMY CORBELL: Thank you, Shane.

The Coming Disclosure and Quantum Computing


SHANE SMITH: I just want to get to a couple more questions because it has been fascinating. I haven't got any questions that I did so much research on. But for me, what I think one of the reasons why I think it's going to break soon is, you know, tomorrow I'm interviewing the head of quantum computing at—can I come?

JEREMY CORBELL: So cool.

SHANE SMITH: At Google, who now are further ahead than NORAD and China, the other two functioning quantum computers. There will be no more encryption.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yes, correct. Absolutely know that. Yeah.

SHANE SMITH: And so a lot of these things that—

JEREMY CORBELL: Well, there could be encryption actually.

SHANE SMITH: Well not, there's no, not in traditional—

JEREMY CORBELL: We'll argue about it after.

SHANE SMITH: Okay, there we go. But in any case, a lot of these things are like a lot of these secrets are just going to come out. I mean between marriage of AI and quantum, there's just, it's a fast moving field.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yes, it is.

SHANE SMITH: Now not necessarily Google's going to go out there and release everything, but the people will have the tools with which to get in there now. Now what do we think of that? Some of the knock on effects will be of—okay, let's say, let's follow your logic to okay, that the government lied all of these years and that the government—

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah, certain elements.

SHANE SMITH: The deep state. The deep state, okay.

JEREMY CORBELL: Oh, I don't know.

SHANE SMITH: The deep state. The government knowingly lied to the people but kept again the biggest story ever away from everybody. There'll be repercussions for that or what happens when it breaks.

Whistleblowers and Congressional Hearings


JEREMY CORBELL: We need some sort of reconciliation process for the people that committed horrific crimes and are still committing them right now to whistleblowers. Right now you're going to hear from three firsthand whistleblowers as I define them on X. Just made sure I made clear you're going to hear from them come hell or high water because George and I already recorded with them. So you're going to hear it in Congress.

SHANE SMITH: Sorry, you're recording now three whistleblowers?

JEREMY CORBELL: More than that. But we are. I have offered to Congress who have asked me three firsthand whistleblowers. I said no problem. I got them to say yes, we have a hearing date coming. So if they do it, great. If Congress doesn't do it and they're all great. Representative Luna has the task force. She's awesome. Representative Burchett, he's fighting for the truth. Everybody's curious, like me and you. They want to know the truth.

If they don't go out through that process, if we get interference like we did at the last hearing, where I brought the documents that everybody needed to see, and they misappropriated the terminology to someone else and gave credit. It was so weird. But it was a bigger problem than people think. In journalism, it's about chain of custody, right? So they lied to the American public that day.

SHANE SMITH: But do you think that, for example, you were saying some of the people are good. You just said the names. Do you think that they go along a certain way and then somebody comes and says, “Stop them,” and say, “You can't go any further,” or—

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah, it's way worse than that.

SHANE SMITH: Okay, go tell me.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah, well, I mean, there's everything from just—what do you call it when you work at a place? Bureaucratic terrorism, you know, or administrative terrorism. Holding people in purgatory with their clearances. So they work there. They don't work there. They're allowed to do what they're doing. They're not allowed to do what they're doing. You sit there, man, seven months, nine months, two years, you're never allowed out, man. And it's just because you saw something you weren't supposed to see. Accidental. They called it spillage.

There are so many issues like that. That's why people come to me, is because they've heard that I've helped other people, they trust me, and I keep their secrets, and then I help them and I move forward. And honestly, it's because I want to know what they know. I mean, there is a selfish aspect to it. I want to know what's going on, you know? But that has been a funny role that I've played, is bringing people together.

SHANE SMITH: So that's happening now. Three whistleblowers.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah, yeah, right now, man. Already recorded. So if it doesn't come out in Congress under oath to the American public, and by the way, it's all safe. It's taken care of. National security. Don't worry. We're thinkers over here, right? The people talking, they're not idiots. They've worked their whole lives in the shadows. CIA working in State Department working in all official capacity. You could imagine, from military to intelligence. They ain't dummies. They live here. They love this country.

But this needs to come out, especially because they're being enacted again. So the next hearing is to protect whistleblowers. If we get this done, we set precedent. If David Grush, who I said was a baller, right, Godzilla, if that mother is taken care of, if we—

SHANE SMITH: So he's no longer working for the government?

JEREMY CORBELL: Well, no. See, this is a historic thing. So Representative Burleson and the task force under Luna brought him as a whistleblower back into government because he had all the clearances for a limited time to be the kind of liaison to the world of whistleblowers to help them bring people forward to do congressional hearings. So it's weird. You get a whistleblower who's now a government employee again. So this is a guy who's a real credit to the intelligence.

SHANE SMITH: Do you think there'll be any new information come out of that? Those congressional hearings or not?

JEREMY CORBELL: A hundred. But if they do the hearings, yes. If not, it'll come out unweaponized. And me and George Knapp, because we already recorded with them, we're going to tell the whole truth, nothing but the truth. Help us God.

SHANE SMITH: But do you think that this will come out through—

JEREMY CORBELL: Do I think you're going to believe in UFOs after this? Is that what you're asking?

SHANE SMITH: No, I'm asking do you think that there'll be new information out of these—

JEREMY CORBELL: Congressional hearings with 100% certainty? If congressional hearings are held with these whistleblowers 100%, you're going to get new information. And I can also assure you that if they don't for some reason where the executive branch steps on their neck like Godzilla and stops them from doing it, that information is coming out anyway. It just won't be in a congressional setting. It's going to be through journalism.

Opening Area 51 and Public Disclosure


SHANE SMITH: And what would it take for, you know, Area 51 or S4 or these places to be opened up? Like, what would—

JEREMY CORBELL: Well, we shouldn't open them up, man. Great projects are—

SHANE SMITH: Or like, okay, open it up in the sense of you can show a little bit without, you know, hurting the national security.

JEREMY CORBELL: Missouri. I looked it up on Wikipedia. So, no, it's true. Missouri is the “Show Me State.” Did I get that right?

SHANE SMITH: Probably.

JEREMY CORBELL: I think so. My dream is we take a craft. Just one of them.

SHANE SMITH: Yeah, exactly. The Jello mold.

JEREMY CORBELL: Take the Jello mold.

SHANE SMITH: Take the boring.

JEREMY CORBELL: I want the sport model. I want Bob's sport model. Because how nostalgic would it be for him to be in Missouri? Take the sport model. Put it in a museum. Now, you can't dent this metal. You can't blowtorch it. You can't do anything. Just do a little metal detector on the way and make sure people aren't crazy. Let them sign, look at the seats themselves. Let them go and hit a little hammer. Just have them on little strings or feel it.

SHANE SMITH: Casey said, when you feel it. Now, the other thing is, he said if you go underneath it, you couldn't see it because of the response when—

JEREMY CORBELL: It's active, because there's gravitational distortion, allegedly from a lot of these scientists have worked on them. There's a field propulsion system. So what happens is it energizes, becomes silent. After it's maybe 15 feet up, don't quote me on that. And then there's a wrapping, kind of like a warping of space time. That's what they say. I don't know. This is wild.

SHANE SMITH: But you look up to it. Yeah. So to go back to it, if there's this wrapping of space time and you can't see it, how does that explain the fact that we can see these other ones?

The Phoenix Lights


JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah, well, sometimes, obviously, they want you to see them. So the thing is, Phoenix Lights. Let's get really specific.

SHANE SMITH: Yes. Go.

JEREMY CORBELL: Mass sighting.

SHANE SMITH: So on March 13, 1997, thousands reported—

JEREMY CORBELL: Seeing a V-shaped light formation in the sky. The Phoenix Lights. Huge craft.

SHANE SMITH: Really?

JEREMY CORBELL: Oh, yeah. There's this Navy pilot that came to rent one of my properties, and he just looked at me. And his wife actually said it. She goes, “We saw it.” So they did some research. And I was like, “Damn, you tell me what you saw. You can rent the house. Come on.” No, this was in California. But he was a growler pilot, and she had actually seen it with her family.

And so this huge—I mean, she said from mountain to mountain just blacked out the sky. But you could see a little swarming of the stars, as if it was almost see through, kind of like what you're talking about. The thing is, she's not alone. And her dad was a doctor, her mom was a lawyer. Okay, I get it. You're credible.

So many people saw this. Even the governor of Arizona. There was too many calls, which is actually very instructive. We should talk about that. Too many calls to his office. So he came out with an alien costume.

SHANE SMITH: And now I'll ask Officer Stein and—

JEREMY CORBELL: His colleagues to escort the accused into the room so that we may all look upon the guilty party.

SHANE SMITH: Don't get him too close to me, please.

JEREMY CORBELL: He goes, “I found the culprit.” And he has him in handcuffs like, yeah, there's nothing to see here. Move on. Problem is a buddy of mine named James made a movie and interviewed the guy, the governor of Arizona at the time.

SHANE SMITH: The guy who came out?

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah, like decades later. And what he said was, “I saw it too.” And he was a fighter pilot, a trained observer. And he says, “I couldn't say it at the time. It would have caused panic.” So he did that stunt, but he was repenting. He's like, “I saw it too. There's nothing we have that can do that.”

SHANE SMITH: I think we both maybe don't agree. I would say I don't think it causes panic. I don't think it causes panic.

JEREMY CORBELL: I agree.

SHANE SMITH: I don't think, I mean, this whole thing of like—

JEREMY CORBELL: It's going to touch back.

SHANE SMITH: I think it's going to cause a lot of people to go, “Finally, come on now.”

The Classification Game: UAP vs UAS


JEREMY CORBELL: I agree, but I think also we're getting there. Remember, because it was such stigma to the point where now on Navy ships, my boys are doing something really cool. Because of mine and George's reporting, not solely, but a lot because of it, if you label it UAP, it's instantly classified. That's a new thing.

However, if you label it a UAS, Unmanned Aerial System, it's not instantly classified. So the dudes that write down things in ships, I know a lot of them. 2019, they wrote UAS. So that's how we know about it. That's how I—

SHANE SMITH: The Mosul thing would be a UAS. Kind of looks like a UAS to me.

JEREMY CORBELL: Unmanned. Well, you talk about a drone. So whatever that is, the Mosul orb.

SHANE SMITH: Well, just a small little orb going.

JEREMY CORBELL: There, and that's like, I don't know what size it is because until now, I haven't had the, I call them nerds. George Knapp calls them online detectives. I gave everybody the actual numeric imprint from the footage. So you can see altitude, flight path, all that stuff.

Now that, as of today, they have the video, although the government blocked out all the numbers, it's only four seconds long. They can reverse engineer that. And I am so curious. What is the size? Is it the size of a nickel? Is it the size of a house? Like, how big is it? I don't know. I'm not a nerd.

The Power of Online Sleuths


SHANE SMITH: Did you ever see the movie “Don't F* with Cats”?

JEREMY CORBELL: I think I have.

SHANE SMITH: It's about—

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah, on Netflix or something.

SHANE SMITH: Yeah, it's, I mean, it's, he's laughing. It's a fantastic—

JEREMY CORBELL: It's good, right?

SHANE SMITH: No, it's a fantastic movie. But basically, you're going to like this. It's a fantastic movie because basically, this guy with cats, he killed some cats, right?

JEREMY CORBELL: Ew.

SHANE SMITH: Exactly. And so, but these sleuths, online sleuths, like there's hundreds of thousands—

JEREMY CORBELL: I have seen it. I have seen it.

SHANE SMITH: They find him for murder.

JEREMY CORBELL: Thousands of people looking to find this guy.

SHANE SMITH: There was a tidal wave of leads that were coming in. “I wasn't going to stop until I found him. Clearly, this video is not the end.”

SHANE SMITH: And they get him. They catch him for murder. And they followed him because of the murder of these cats, right?

JEREMY CORBELL: Oh, he did that stabby thing on the bed, the weirdo.

SHANE SMITH: Well, he killed somebody in Montreal.

JEREMY CORBELL: Did he do that stabby thing and pretend to eat him or something, bro? Is that what he did? He was that dude that was like—

SHANE SMITH: Anyway, I'm just saying what's interesting about that dude. What's interesting about that is that there's people out there that can solve anything, dude. Online with footage. So we need to mobilize if anyone's watching this. The “Don't F* with Cats” type people out in the world and say, “Let's look at these different types of footage without bias.”

Crowdsourcing the UAP Puzzle


JEREMY CORBELL: No, no, but hold on. You know, about the world, this is such an impassioned, I have never seen people go more crazy over something other than animals like cats. I'm down with that. You hurt a dog. But with the UFO thing, we all have a bias. I like to believe I know, but I do. My bias is that, oh, come on, we're not alone. You think you're the smartest monkey? Somebody else got here. But that's my bias, right? But I try to eliminate and take that out.

There are paid people online to tell you that the Mosul Orb is a pothole. Like, I know they're paid, they've admitted they're paid, that kind of thing. So you're up against a, again, perception management is an actual, like, they actually have an office. I want to go in there.

So I'm saying that, yes, let's crowdsource the UAP problem. The puzzle. Let's crowdsource the UAP puzzle. Yes. Not one piece of footage is going to be the end all and be all. This is just to provoke and to expose people for telling the truth and not telling the truth. This is a tool to get to the bigger—

SHANE SMITH: Also, if you get hundreds of millions of people all, by the way, clamoring and electing people. That's how you get elected. It's going to force information to the fore. And so if it becomes a big issue, that a lot of voters are saying, “What the hell are you doing?”

JEREMY CORBELL: I agree. Yeah. And your optimism is inspirational to me because I've been fighting this battle. Not even like George Knapp's been fighting for 40 years alone, right? I pulled him back in. I'm sure he was going to quit a billion times. He told me he would, right?

The fact you're a journalist and you're saying, “Let's solve this, dude.” I don't have many people that want to solve this. Your optimism that we're going to solve it, it's either naive or inspirational, because probably both. George thought he was going to solve it in six months. “Just need a good journalist on this. That's all we need, bro.”

It's like we're smashing our heads against a wall with online armies of people trying to stop us from doing journalism. If you're going to really dive in, in any way, I can tell you who to speak with. I can tell you who's legitimate, who's full of sh*t. I am happy to tell you. I got a lot. Well, save you 10 years.

Reaching Critical Mass


SHANE SMITH: There we go. Good. I would like to, on that note, keep the channels open. This is an ongoing discussion.

JEREMY CORBELL: You.

SHANE SMITH: Yeah, because it feels like there's sort of a critical mass.

JEREMY CORBELL: I agree.

SHANE SMITH: You know, and so if there is a critical mass going, because you've been in the fight a long time, I come in and there's another guy, and we bring in more, and we get the “Don't F* with Cats” people, and we get everybody. And then, you know, you talk to some people in government, in politics, et cetera, et cetera.

JEREMY CORBELL: Too much.

SHANE SMITH: I mean, there's a lot of people like, you know, and maybe it's just lip service, but it was a concern to the Republican base about, you know, JFK not releasing it. So they didn't release all of it, but they released a bunch of it. And of course, you know, what it proves is that the CIA were working with the people who killed JFK, which is what they didn't want to have happen. Yeah, everybody knew that.

JEREMY CORBELL: Everybody knew it.

SHANE SMITH: Everybody knew it.

JEREMY CORBELL: But I think that's the plan. Yeah.

SHANE SMITH: Whistleblowers.

JEREMY CORBELL: Right.

SHANE SMITH: So, look, all of the truth will absolutely—

JEREMY CORBELL: Yes.

SHANE SMITH: And so let's keep the dialogue open, and if there is any breaking news, you're going to come here and we're going to talk about it.

The Decision to Go All In


JEREMY CORBELL: Well, you're going to be a busy man, because I'm going to be breaking news like it's nobody's business. I like a propulsion system that is going to continuously be breaking news because I made a decision, and this is real. I'm going to tell you something real right now, and you'll see this. You actually see this documented, which is interesting.

George Knapp and I made a decision, and our decision is that we're going to put, he thinks he doesn't have long to live. And I'm thinking, like, let's do this right. We're going to put our best stuff forward. We're going to try to provoke. We're going to push. We're not going to stop. We've made a decision to put out our best evidence and, you know, be damned everything else, because people have not liked what we've done. But it, anyway, there you go.

Okay. Thank you for having me on. I appreciate it. It's nice to re-meet you. It's different to meet you now.

SHANE SMITH: Thank you for your time.

JEREMY CORBELL: Thank you.

SHANE SMITH: This was awesome.

JEREMY CORBELL: Thank you so much for just having the conversation.

SHANE SMITH: Oh, it was great.

JEREMY CORBELL: Yeah. I don't know if we're going to crack it, but you're awesome.

SHANE SMITH: Oh, well, it's first steps. First step.

JEREMY CORBELL: Thank you for the whiskey, man. You guys all invited? Have a sip of mine.

Paramount Pictures is reviving the Paranormal Activity franchise alongside Blumhouse-Atomic Monster. And in a world where it seems to take 84 years for some things to progress, this film is already starting to chug ahead just weeks after its announcement. The Paranormal Activity reboot film is placing Canadian filmmaker Ian Tuason in the director's chair. Additionally, James Wan will serve as a producer for the project. 

These films are found footage flicks that rely on a lot of jump scares and such to thrill viewers. Somehow, there are seven films in this franchise already, yet I cannot tell you a thing about any installment after Paranormal Activity 2. It's hard to remix the same concept in various ways, yet people are still obviously showing up for the sequels. The last one, Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin, wasn't too long ago in 2021. 

And we'd assume that this next film will hit in a year or so. It would make sense to have this reboot film's release in 2027 to celebrate 20 years of the franchise. We will see what information continues to land as the months roll by.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=paranormal","The new Paranormal Activity movie gets a director: Ian Tuason","https://www.joblo.com/paranormal-activity-ian-tuason/","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 14:50:54 GMT","

Producer Jason Blum had said the Paranormal Activity franchise went dormant for a while after the release of 2015's Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension because he felt the series had gotten tired – and it wasn't his idea to make Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin, a failed attempt at a revival (that he described as “terrible”), back in 2021. He has been open about the fact that he feels there has been “enough already” when it comes to Paranormal Activity movies… but he just can't seem to stop it. A couple of weeks ago, it was announced that a new Paranormal Activity movie is in the works at Paramount, with genre regular James Wan (the Conjuring Universe, Saw, Insidious, etc.) joining the franchise to produce the film alongside Blum. Now, The Hollywood Reporter has broken the news that the new movie has found a director: Ian Tuason.

Ian Tuason is said to be in “final negotiations” to take on the directing gig. The filmmaker got his start by making live-action virtual reality horror shorts, which got millions of views on YouTube and a showcase at SXSW. His feature debut, Undertone, premiered at the Fantasia International Film Festival earlier this year, where it won the audience award and sparked a distribution bidding war. A24 overcame five other bidders to land the distribution rights, making a deal that was said to be in the mid-seven figures.

Undertone follows the host of an ‘all-things-creepy' podcast, who moves into her dying mother's house to be her primary caregiver. When her podcast is sent 10 audio recordings of a young pregnant couple experiencing paranormal noises, she realizes the woman's story is a mirror of her own and each new recording scratches at her sanity, drawing her into a fate she cannot escape. Nina Kiri stars in the film, and her character, Evy, is the only on-camera speaking role in the entire film. So much of the film relies on the sound design that Tuason has described it as a “found audio” movie rather than a “found footage” movie. It will be screening at Sundance next month.

As The Hollywood Reporter notes, Tuason has previously said that the three movies that creep him out the most are The Exorcist, The Blair Witch Project, and the original Paranormal Activity.

Blum's Blumhouse Productions recently merged with Wan's company Atomic Monster, pulling Wan into the Paranormal Activity world. Paramount is co-financing and co-producing the film with Blumhouse-Atomic Monster, while original Paranormal Activity writer/director Oren Peli is also on board to produce through his company Solana Films. This project will get theatrical distribution through Paramount and is said to be a priority for all of the companies involved.

Steven Schneider will executive produce for the film Room 101, Inc., while Michael Clear and Judson Scott do the same for Blumhouse-Atomic Monster. Executive Alayna Glasthal is overseeing the project for the company.

Wan provided the following statement: “I've been a huge admirer of Paranormal Activity since the brilliant first movie, with its creeping slow burn and subtle ability to make the unseen terrifying. I'm looking forward to expanding on its legacy and helping shape the next evolution of this scary found-footage franchise.” Blum added, “Diving in with James for this exciting rebirth of the franchise that started it all for Blumhouse is exactly what we dreamed of when we merged with Atomic Monster. I'll be actively involved with him to introduce this new chapter. Thankfully, we're able to spend a little more than the $15,000 we had on the first movie, but one thing will remain the same — do not see it alone. We look forward to partnering with Josh Greenstein, Dana Goldberg, David Ellison, Jeff Shell and their teams at Paramount as we bring Paranormal Activity back to life.“

Paramount Pictures co-chairs Josh Greenstein and Dana Goldberg had this to say about the franchise revival: “We're thrilled to reignite the iconic Paranormal Activity franchise with two of the horror genre's most visionary talents, James and Jason. Jason's role in shaping this franchise into a global cultural touchstone, together with James' singular taste and track record for innovative storytelling, sets the stage for a thrilling new chapter.“

Released in 2009, the original Paranormal Activity was followed by Paranormal Activity 2 (2010), Paranormal Activity 3 (2011), Paranormal Activity 4 (2012), Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones (2014), Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension (2015), and Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin (2021). In Japan, the unofficial entry Paranormal Activity 2: Tokyo Night was also released in 2010.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=extraterrestrial","‘A lot of stories but very few facts': sceptics push back on buzzy UFO documentary","https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/15/the-age-of-disclosure-ufo-documentary","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 12:04:00 GMT","

The Age of Disclosure was granted a Capitol Hill screening and has broken digital rental records but does it really offer proof of alien life?

It has been hailed as a game changer in public attitudes towards UFOs, ending a culture of silence around claims once dismissed as the preserve of conspiracy theorists and crackpots.

The Age of Disclosure has been boosted in its effort to shift the conversation about extraterrestrials from the fringe to the mainstream with a Capitol Hill screening and considerable commercial success. It broke the record for highest-grossing documentary on Amazon's Prime Video within 48 hours of its release, Deadline reported this week.

But not everyone is impressed by the film's claims that UFOs – now called UAPs (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) – are real and that governments have been hiding evidence for decades. Several sceptics have gone online to push back at The Age of Disclosure, contending that it has been over-hyped and fails to present new or compelling evidence.

In their telling, the documentary has slick production values but rehashes familiar, decades-old grainy infrared videos and anecdotal pilot testimonies insufficient to support extraordinary claims of alien technology.

Michael Shermer, the founding publisher of Skeptic magazine, says by phone from Santa Barbara, California: “All we have are blurry photographs, grainy videos and anecdotes from people that say they know somebody who knows something, or they know somebody who said they saw the spaceship, touched the aliens or worked on back engineering the spaceships and so on.

“But if you say, who was this person you talked to? ‘Well, I can't tell you.' Where was the spaceship? ‘I can't tell you.' Do you have any photographs? ‘No, but here's this grainy video of this blob that was taken from a navy pilot 14 years ago off the coast of San Diego. This is kind of weird. It's hard to say what it is but it could be aliens.'”

Shermer, who for 30 years taught college and university courses in critical thinking and has written books including Why People Believe Weird Things, adds: “From a scientific point of view, none of this is valuable other than well, there might be something interesting here, let's go find out. It's no different from the whole search for Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Yeti, that whole thing.”

Directed and produced by Dan Farah, The Age of Disclosure asserts an 80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligent life and secret recovery and reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial technology. It features interviews with 34 individuals from US government, military and intelligence backgrounds.

They include secretary of state and national security adviser Marco Rubio, senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota and former director of national intelligence James Clapper. Their presence has been seen as giving the film heft and helping reduce the stigma long felt by alleged UAP witnesses.

In an interview last week on Fox News, Rubio was asked about his claim in the documentary that unknown entities have been operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities. He did not attack the documentary or seek to disown his remarks – but he did seek to add some context.

“First of all, I'm not disavowing that,” Rubio said. “It was an interview that was done almost, like, maybe three or four years ago when I was in the senate. So it wasn't recent. The second point I would make, I was describing the allegations that people have come forward with … I was describing what people had said to me, not things that I had firsthand knowledge of in that regard. A little bit of selective editing, but it's okay because you're trying to sell a show there.”

Sceptics argue that UAP sightings are better explained by a combination of misidentification of mundane objects (balloons, satellites, drones), perceptual errors in low-information environments, secret terrestrial technologies and misunderstood optical and sensor phenomena.

Jason Colavito, author of The Cult of Alien Gods: HP Lovecraft and Extraterrestrial Pop Culture, comments: “While I can't possibly give a single explanation for UFOs, or categorically say that no UFO has ever been an alien spaceship, every UFO that has ever been identified has turned out to be a prosaic – either natural or human made – object, and there's no reason to suspect that any of the objects seen in that movie are anything but that.”

Colavito was left cold by The Age of Disclosure. “I found the film to basically be an Ancient Aliens episode with better lighting,” he says. “It was a rehash of material that has been used many times before. I thought that it was old stuff in a slick new package. A lot of the people that you saw interviewed have already appeared on Ancient Aliens, on NewsNation and on other platforms saying the same thing.

“The only surprising thing was that they actually went into some of the more extreme and ridiculous pseudoscientific claims they make about how we can't photograph UFOs clearly because they're in a space time quantum bubble that distorts all the light around them so we can't see them. That's obviously an ex post facto explanation. These are things that people who are very smart have fooled themselves into thinking are true in order to justify a belief that they already came into the process holding.”

Colavito notes that the film has had an extensive and expensive publicity campaign including a Hollywood-style premiere. He sees it as part of a sophisticated media campaign aimed at securing government funding for defence contractors and associated thinktanks.

“One of the things that surprised me is how much of the film seemed to be an advertisement for investing in UFO-themed energy research. That's where you have to look into the question of how many of the talking heads in that documentary have government ties, not just that they formerly worked in the government, but that they are currently profiting from the work that they're doing promoting UFOs.

“Luis Elizondo [an author and UAP disclosure activist who also serves as an executive producer on the film], for example, works for a defence contracting company, or at least did until recently, and many of the others also have current or former ties to defence contractors and other businesses and entities that make money from government contracts and government investment.”

But for all the headlines and TV attention, Colavito doubts that the buzz will last. “It's already fading from coverage,” he says. “This was the kind of thing that has a big publicity campaign leading up to it but then, once people begin to see the actual product, interest falls off rapidly because there is nothing new and nothing convincing in the film. There are a lot of stories but very few facts.”

Joshua Semeter, director of Boston University's Center for Space Physics, has only seen the trailer for The Age of Disclosure and was unimpressed. “I guess the word is disappointed to see that their primary evidence is all of these grainy infrared videos.” he says. “There's a lot of money to be made by keeping things in the spooky category. That's basically what's going on here.”

Semeter, who served on a Nasa team studying the origin of UAPs, believes that the film is unlikely to create a lasting cultural shift or mainstream acceptance of its claims. Instead it is the culmination of a recent period of heightened interest in UAPs.

“We went through a UAP bubble over the past eight years and a lot of this evidence that's being put forth by the aviators is very old evidence from the 2000s. We're at the tail end. This production was an effort to grab the last little bits as we head out of the current UAP bubble.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","other"

It sounds like the plot of a sci-fi thriller, but a former Russian president insists it is his real life story. Kirsan Ilyumzinov has publicly claimed that he was taken aboard an alien spacecraft while he was still in office, and that some of the most powerful leaders on Earth were aware of similar encounters but stayed silent.

According to Ilyumzinov, the extraordinary event took place in September 1997 while he was president of the Russian republic of Kalmykia. Speaking on a recent podcast, he said the night began in a completely ordinary way.

He recalled returning to his Moscow apartment after work, switching on the television, and preparing to sleep. Then came something he described as a half dream, half reality moment. From his open window, he claimed to see a glowing, translucent tube forming in the air.

'There was something like a translucent pipe glowing, made of some matter,' he said. 'I was invited by them.'

Curious rather than afraid, he said he stepped into the tube and was transported into a vast space that he later understood to be a spacecraft. Inside, he claimed to see beings who looked strikingly similar to humans, dressed in yellow garments, communicating not with speech but through thoughts.

Ilyumzinov described the interior of the craft as enormous, comparable to several football fields. He said the air initially felt thin until one of the beings gestured for him to press on his chest, after which breathing became easy.

'I felt calm. I was not nervous,' he said, adding that the space smelled faintly like the sea or a forest.

He claimed the beings showed him parts of the ship, including large window like openings through which he could see what looked like a fiery planet giving off heat. At one point, he said he asked why they did not reveal themselves to humanity.

Their response, he claimed, was blunt. Humanity was not ready. Comparing humans to ants, the beings allegedly told him that civilisations exist at different levels of development, and that Earth was still too violent and destructive to engage openly with others.

Perhaps the most unsettling detail is that Ilyumzinov says he did not simply imagine the experience. He insists there were witnesses to his sudden disappearance.

His chief of staff later confirmed that when colleagues arrived at his apartment the next morning to take him to the airport, he was nowhere to be found. Phones, clothes and slippers were still in place. The bedroom had been searched repeatedly.

Then, after more than an hour of confusion and even a call to the police, Ilyumzinov allegedly walked calmly out of the bedroom.

'He laughed and said, well, aliens took me,' his longtime aide recalled.

Ilyumzinov himself said he was surprised by how normal he felt afterwards, suggesting the beings may have influenced his mental state to prevent panic or trauma.

The former president went even further, alleging that knowledge of extraterrestrial contact is quietly shared among global elites. He said he discussed UFOs with figures such as Mikhail Gorbachev and Henry Kissinger, and claimed that US and Soviet officials once exchanged information on the subject.

'Henry Kissinger was watching me closely. He was a man of few words,' he recalled of one encounter.

Most explosively, Ilyumzinov claimed that another sitting president of a major nation privately confided in him about a similar alien encounter during a fishing trip, but refused to go public for fear of political ruin.

He suggested leaders like Putin, Trump and Xi Jinping are likely aware of UFO programmes and extraterrestrial presence, but choose silence to avoid public panic and ridicule.

Whether seen as a sincere belief, a mystical experience, or an extraordinary claim demanding extraordinary proof, Ilyumzinov's story has reignited debate about UFOs and what the world's most powerful figures may really know. One thing is certain. When a former head of state says he was taken by aliens while in office, people are bound to listen.

Erika Kirk said she and Candace Owens will meet Monday, days after Charlie Kirk's widow joined a CBS town hall and said she wanted Owens to stop peddling conspiracy theories about her late husband's assassination.

Kirk said on X that she and Owens would have a ""private, in-person meeting"" Monday. She added that they ""agreed that public discussions, livestreams, and tweets are on hold until after this meeting"" and that she's looking forward to a ""productive discussion.""

Owens wrote on X that she's ""very much looking forward to this discussion.""

Erika Kirk sat down with CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss last week for a town hall that aired Saturday on CBS. Weiss asked Erika Kirk what she would want to say to Owens, who has been amplifying conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk's assassination.

""Stop,"" Erika Kirk said. ""That's it. That's all I have to say. Stop.""

Owens, a onetime friend of Charlie Kirk's and a former employee of his conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA, previously compared their relationship to that of a ""brother and sister.""

The day after his assassination, she posted a lengthy video, saying she wanted him to be remembered for his career and ideas. In the months since, Owens has pushed conspiracy theories about his murder and made unfounded fraud allegations about the finances at Turning Point, which Erika Kirk now runs.

The Treasury Department has since confirmed that none of the tax-exempt entities Erika Kirk oversees are under investigation by the IRS.

Here's why.","https://www.livescience.com/space/comets/the-uns-international-asteroid-warning-network-is-closely-watching-comet-3i-atlas-heres-why","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 10:00:00 GMT","



Tracking comets accurately is hard. A new effort with the U.N. and NASA aims to better chart these visitors using 3I/ATLAS. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


As the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS prepares for its closest approach to Earth on Dec. 19, it's being monitored not just by space agencies but also the United Nations.

The comet, which will come within roughly 167 million miles (270 million kilometers) of our planet, will be tracked by telescopes around the world so astronomers can pinpoint its location and make predictions about future objects like it.

The U.N.'s International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) is about halfway through its 3I/ATLAS observing campaign and expects to publish its findings in a peer-reviewed journal next year, James Bauer, a small-bodies node principal investigator at IAWN and a research professor in the University of Maryland's astronomy department, told Live Science. The network consists of more than 80 observatories and citizen scientists around the world doing active research on near-Earth objects, such as comets and asteroids.

NASA coordinates the IAWN and the network's observing campaigns, Bauer said, and 3I/ATLAS is the first interstellar object to be tracked since the campaigns began in 2017. (Notably, the potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroid Apophis was observed by IAWN in 2020 and 2021, and a new campaign is expected between 2027 and 2029 as the asteroid makes a safe-but-close approach to Earth.)

""The idea behind these campaigns is really to strengthen the technical capabilities for measuring sky positions, which we call astrometry, for asteroids and comets,"" Bauer said of IAWN's work. The investigators will be testing a new astrometry technique to track the pathway for 3I/ATLAS, which can be helpful for determining how to send a spacecraft to a similar comet in the future.

""We want the community to use the latest and greatest techniques,"" Bauer said. (Bauer also serves as principal investigator for the NASA Planetary Data System's small bodies node, which archives, catalogs and distributes scientific data related to comets, asteroids and interplanetary dust.)

 




IAWN had been planning an observing campaign like this since October 2024, so 3I/ATLAS was a late-but-fortuitous arrival when it was first spotted in late June. The interstellar comet's upcoming close approach coincides well with the team's planned observing schedule, and because 3I/ATLAS was visible in the network's observatories and of high interest, it seemed like a great fit, Bauer said.

There are challenges in accurately measuring a comet's position, he noted, such as the changing brightness and the variability in its coma, the cloud of gas and dust that extends around the comet's nucleus and tail as it draws closer to the sun and heats up. These features can inflate the comet's apparent size and make its location harder to pinpoint.

Luckily, although 3I/ATLAS originated outside the solar system, it's showing such classic comet behavior that it is almost a ""comet's comet,"" Bauer said. For example, it includes components like water and carbon dioxide that are behaving similarly to normal solar system comets.

—Mars orbiter narrows down the exact path of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS by 'ten-fold,' surprising scientists

—New NASA, ESA images show 3I/ATLAS getting active ahead of its close encounter with Earth

—Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is erupting in 'ice volcanoes', new images suggest

Community interest has been high. Citizen scientists, observatories large and small, and scientific organizations formed a record 171 campaign participants at the kickoff of IAWN's 3I/ATLAS campaign meeting in October. The mid-campaign teleconference, held Dec. 9 and days before Bauer's interview with Live Science, had 100 campaign participants.

""We've been answering questions from the community — for example, 'How to use the tool? What is the proper format for observing, or for reporting the observations?'"" Bauer said.

He said he's grateful for the community's time and interest, as it is helping astronomers refine their ability to report the positions of objects in the sky — including ""vigilance"" for other near-Earth asteroids and objects that come much closer to our planet.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story. 

A wave of Ukrainian drones targeted the Russian capital overnight on Dec. 14-15, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin claimed. 

The attack comes less than a week after Ukraine reportedly attacked Moscow with over 30 drones in a mass strike on Dec. 10.

Russian air defense units have shot down at least 18 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) en route to Moscow, Sobyanin said. Emergency response crews are clearing wreckage from the attack sites. 

No casualties or damage have been reported. Temporary restrictions have been imposed at Moscow's Zhukovsky and Domodedovo airports.

Residents of the Istrinksy district, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Moscow, have reported over a dozen loud explosions, according to the Russian Telegram news channel Shot. Residents of Kashira and Kolomna in southern Moscow Oblast also reported explosions. 

The Russian Defense Ministry later reported at 7:18 a.m. local time that 25 drones were shot down over Moscow Oblast, including 15 flying towards the capital. A total of 130 drones were intercepted across Russia during the night, the ministry said. 

Sobyanin announced at 7:41 a.m. that three more drones were shot down during their flight to Moscow, bringing the total to 18. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports at the time of publication. 

Ukraine regularly uses long-range drones to target military and industrial targets in Russia. On Dec. 13, Ukrainian forces struck a number of assets in Russia and in occupied territories, including the Afipsky Oil Refinery in Krasnodar Krai, the Uryupinsk oil depot in Vologograd Oblast, and two fuel depots in Crimea.

Previous attacks on Moscow have disrupted aviation operations, grounding and delaying hundreds of flights despite the drones being intercepted by air defenses.

Kyiv and Washington made ""real progress"" toward peace in Ukraine during two-day talks in Berlin, top security official and negotiator Rustem Umerov said on Dec. 15.

Encircled Russian troops in Kupiansk are still getting limited drone drops — and a Ukrainian official says some included flags, not food.




For the first time, Ukrainian underwater drones have successfully attacked a Russian submarine, Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) reported on Dec. 15.

Nadya Tolokonnikova, a co-founder of the group, said the verdict aims ""to erase Pussy Riot's very existence from the Russian consciousness.""

A KIIS poll found 75% of Ukrainians rejected a Donbas pullback plan without security guarantees, while most supported freezing the front line with strong protections.




Ukraine's Security Service said its long-range drones struck Russian offshore oil platforms in the Caspian Sea for the third time in a week, halting operations at one site.


Less than one-tenth of Ukrainians support holding immediate elections, even in the absence of a ceasefire with Russia, according to a recent poll.

A thermal power plant in Belgorod, known as ""Luch"", was damaged during a wave of drone attacks on Russian territory overnight on Dec. 15, Astra reported, citing local residents.



Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz floated the idea of transferring Warsaw's remaining Soviet-designed MiG-29s to Kyiv in exchange for Ukraine's drone and anti-drone technology.

The International Chess Federation's (FIDE) General Assembly on Dec. 14 allowed teams from Russia and Belarus to participate in international tournaments and permitted youth chess players to compete under national symbols.

Russian air defense units have shot down at least 15 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) en route to Moscow, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said. 

The attack caused ""serious damage"" to an unspecified facility, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. Local Telegram channels reported explosions at a key thermal power plant.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Donald Trump issued a bizarre statement in which he claimed director Rob Reiner, and his wife, succumbed to “Trump derangement syndrome” after they were found dead in their home.

Nick Reiner, 32, the couple's son, was arrested after they were reportedly found dead by their daughter with their throats slit at their LA home.

Mr Trump issued a statement in which he suggested Reiner's “obsession” with him contributed to his death.

“A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood. Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as Trump derangement syndrome,” the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform.

He continued: “He [Reiner] was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before. May Rob and Michele rest in peace!”

Nick previously struggled with drug addiction, which began in his early teens and left him living intermittently on the streets.

In 2016, he told People: “I was homeless in Maine. I was homeless in New Jersey. I was homeless in Texas. I spent nights on the street. I spent weeks on the street. It was not fun.”

His experience later became the story of a semi-autobiographical film, Being Charlie, which he co-wrote and his father directed. Nick, who admitted in interviews that he “didn't bond” with his father, said the film had brought them closer together.

The Los Angeles Fire Department said it responded to a medical aid request shortly after 3.30pm on Sunday and found a 78-year-old man and 68-year-old woman dead inside the building. Reiner turned 78 in March.

Showbusiness website TMZ reported that the Reiners had their throats slit, allegedly by a family member.

Reiner was one of the most prolific directors in Hollywood. His work included some of the most memorable films of the 1980s and 90s, including This is Spinal Tap, A Few Good Men, When Harry Met Sally and The Princess Bride. He also acted, starring in Sleepless in Seattle and The Wolf of Wall Street, among others.

Michele Reiner was ‍at one time a photographer, and took the image of Mr Trump that appears on the cover of his book Trump: The Art of the ⁠Deal.

A spokesman for the Reiner family said: “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.”

Billy Crystal, who starred in When Harry Met Sally alongside Meg Ryan, was seen at the Reiner family home looking distraught hours after the bodies were discovered. Crystal was accompanied by his wife Janice, who appeared to be wiping a tear from her eye.

The comedian and actor Larry David, who was friends with Reiner, was also seen at the home and appeared upset too, a neighbour said.

Reiner, the son of the actor and screenwriter Carl Reiner, met his wife while he was directing When Harry Met Sally. They married in 1989 and had three children together, Jake, 34, Nick, and Romy.

Reiner also adopted a daughter, Tracy Reiner, 61, with his first wife, Penny Marshall, who played Laverne in Laverne & Shirley.

Jake, a former sports reporter, was inspired by his father's love of baseball. He later moved into acting and producing.

Romy, who has a few small acting credits in American films, was often pictured on the red carpet and on holiday with her parents.

Reiner was a Democrat, backing John Kerry in 2004 and featured in advertisements ‍taking aim at the incumbent president George W Bush. He also supported the Democratic presidential hopefuls Al Gore and Hillary Clinton, and was a critic of Mr Trump.

Barack Obama, the former president, paid tribute, writing on X: “Rob's achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen.

“But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people – and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action.”

Actor Jerry O'Connell, who starred in the 1986 film Stand By Me, which Reiner directed, told CBS News that the late director earned his respect because he “did the work”.

O'Connell said: “Rob was a nepo baby. His father was a huge comedy star but Rob did the work.

“On All In The Family they did maybe close to 200 episodes... he had so much experience by the time he was directing Stand By Me.

“I was talking to (co-stars) Corey Feldman and Wil Wheaton about it last night, he would feed us new lines that weren't written, ad lib lines.

“That was just from hundreds of hours of television, thousands of hours working there. The guy did the work, he had so much experience.”

O'Connell told CBS: “I don't mean this as any offence to my parents. Rob was like a father to me. It's just surreal, it really is. Everything I have is because of Rob Reiner.”

Karen Bass, the Los Angeles mayor, called Reiner's death a devastating loss for the city.

She said in a statement: “Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice.

“An acclaimed actor, director, producer, writer, and engaged political activist, he always used his gifts in service of others.”

Eric Idle, the British actor and star of Monty Python, revealed he spoke to Reiner hours before his death. In a tribute, he wrote: “Rob Reiner was a lovely man. I spoke to him last night for over an hour. I always enjoyed his company.

“Last thing he said to me was: ‘See you next year.' Such a terrible end. Such a sweet man.”

He also said they discussed “filming at Stonehenge and his thoughts for the future”.

In a statement, actress Jamie Lee Curtis and her husband Christopher Guest said: “Christopher and I are numb and sad and shocked about the violent, tragic deaths of our dear friends Rob and Michele Singer Reiner and our only focus and care right now is for their children and immediate families and we will offer all support possible to help them.

“There will be plenty of time later to discuss the creative lives we shared and the great political and social impact they both had on the entertainment industry, early childhood development, the fight for gay marriage and their global care for a world in crisis. We have lost great friends. Please give us time to grieve.”

The next time somebody famous dies, head to Wikipedia. It's likely that the entry for that individual will have already been updated to acknowledge the death. 

It's a small example of the big success of an internet operation that was initially ridiculed. How could a loose grouping of volunteers match the strength of the experts who had built the knowledge base encompassed in the weighty books produced by Encyclopedia Britannica and World Book? In today's polarized climate, we might add this other huge barrier: How could they ever find agreement on controversial entries – indeed, any entry, given the passionate disagreements that would inevitably arise over factual accuracy. 

But they did topple the existing encyclopedia giants and have become something we take for granted today. While other tech companies may disappoint, with their algorithms and ads and noise, Wikipedia quietly does the job its founder, Jimmy Wales, set out to accomplish. There are now more than 300 versions in other languages, with total annual page views of 300 billion on a planet with only eight billion people. 

“Wikipedia is no longer a crazy idea. It isn't debated and mocked. It isn't embroiled in scandal. Wikipedia is simply read by immense numbers of people who trust the information it provides,” he writes in The Seven Rules of Trust, along with Ottawa's Dan Gardner, his writing partner for the book.

He stresses that the Wikipedians who build it know that the archive has flaws and failings. But he insists for simple facts – such as how old is Tom Cruise – Wikipedia is outstanding. 

“And as a starting point on more difficult subjects, as a way to get your bearings, to find good sources and begin exploration, Wikipedia is wonderful – on almost any subject under the sun, from the trivial to the profound,” he says. 

Crucial to its success, he believes, was clarity of purpose. At the start, he would repeat regularly, “Wikipedia is an encyclopedia.” That made it clear to the many volunteers what their job was since they all had a mental model of what an encyclopedia does. If he had made a big deal about it being a new way to share information, he would then have a lot of explaining to do to get their attention and have them sign on and then point them in the right direction. This way, people immediately knew its value, what topics to tackle and how it should be written.

“Wikipedia is an encyclopedia” was the first of five pillars his team set out for those volunteers, framing the culture for the organization. The other four were: Wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view. Wikipedia is free content that anyone can use, edit and distribute. Wikipedia editors should treat each other with respect and civility. Wikipedia has no firm rules.

The pillars tended to attract people who were concerned with accuracy. “In time, Wikipedia developed a culture that is obsessed with accuracy,” he writes. “Millions of wonderful hairsplitting details … can be found in Wikipedia because the people who write Wikipedia are overwhelmingly passionate about getting facts right.”

From the beginning, Wikipedia has had the following policy: “Assume good faith.” People are expected to assume the people they are working with – who might have quite different views on the information that should be shared in an entry – have good intentions. 

He shares as an example when a new, anonymous editor might have replaced a paragraph on American presidential politics with something different – and objectionable to you – as an editor. “While you may suspect in the back of your mind that this person is a rotten, self-promoting, partisan hack, you will not respond that way. You will assume this is someone honestly trying to improve Wikipedia. They may be doing a bad job. But they're trying,” he says.

That changes the focus and tone of your response to factual disagreement. Rather than stir up the other person with a vehement attack, you nudge them to a similarly civil stance. Of course, you may not come to an agreement and, after three rounds of discussion, the rule is others are brought into the conversation. 

He notes any organization that needs to draw on the knowledge and skills of a wide array of people must create a healthy environment and for that civility is essential. Some people get a kick out of being rude and abusive, he adds, but most Wikipedians are nice people; they just love to argue – about everything. His team tries to celebrate those who do so in a civil manner, setting them up as examples for others to follow. 

“But civility does not mean – I can't underscore this strongly enough – minimizing or downplaying disagreements, much less avoiding arguments altogether. We not only should disagree when we have sincere, thoughtful objections. We must. Disagreement is how we learn from others and get smarter together,” he writes. 

In 2005, the scientific journal Nature compared 42 entries in Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia, finding an average of three inaccuracies for each in Britannica and four for Wikipedia. Britannica published an open letter complaining the study was flawed. Wikipedia's editors asked the journal to identify the errors so they could be fixed. 

At the core of Wikipedia's success is trust. The people working to produce it have to trust each other. The people using Wikipedia have to trust its information. “In a little more than two decades, Wikipedia has grown from a ridiculous idea that could never work to a globally trusted source of information,” he says.

Britain's new MI6 chief has said Russia is deliberately prolonging negotiations over Ukraine while shifting the cost of the war onto its own population.

Speaking on Monday, Blaise Metreweli said Russian President Vladimir Putin ""is dragging out negotiations and shifting the cost of war onto his own population.""

She warned that Moscow was intensifying pressure below the threshold of open conflict.

""Russia is testing us in the grey zone with tactics that are just below the threshold of war,"" Metreweli said.

She pointed to what she described as efforts to ""bully, fearmonger and manipulate"" through cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, drones flying near European airports, aggressive activity at sea, and state-sponsored arson.

""Across the globe, we are now confronting not one single danger, but an interlocking web of security challenges — military, technological, social, ethical even — each shaping the other in complex ways,"" she said.

Metreweli said Russia had pushed the world into an era of instability. ""We are now operating in a space between peace and war,"" she said, adding that Russia had propelled the world into an ""age of uncertainty.""

She warned that Moscow's behavior was deliberate and likely to persist. ""The export of chaos is a feature, not a bug, in this Russian approach to international engagement, and we should be ready for this to continue until Putin is forced to change his calculus,"" she added.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Kyiv and Washington remain divided over territorial issues after two days of talks in Berlin on ending Russia's war.

Speaking to reporters after the talks in Berlin, Zelenskyy said, ""There has been sufficient dialogue on the territory, and I think that, frankly speaking, we still have different positions, but I believe that my colleagues have heard my personal position.""

He said the issue of territory remains painful but added he believes the United States will help Ukraine find a compromise. Zelenskyy said Ukraine is ready for fair work toward a strong peace agreement and that talks with US counterparts will continue.

Zelenskyy also said the United States is not making its own territorial demands on Ukraine. He said the US delegation had conveyed Russian demands and he stressed that Ukraine needs clear security guarantees before any decisions are made about front lines.

Earlier, Zelenskyy said negotiations with the US delegation would continue and repeated that while positions differ on territory, Ukraine remains committed to achieving a fair and lasting peace deal.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said diplomatic momentum on Ukraine has intensified, calling it possibly the strongest since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Speaking after talks in Berlin, Merz said there was now a real chance for a peace process, adding, ""This plant is still small, but the chance is real.""

Merz thanked US President Donald Trump, saying the progress would not have been possible without his engagement.

He said he was satisfied with talks in Berlin between US and Ukrainian representatives on ending Russia's war.

At a joint news conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Merz said any ceasefire must be backed by strong guarantees.

""This ceasefire must be secured by substantial legal and material security guarantees from the USA and the Europeans,"" he said.

Merz added that proposals presented by the United States in Berlin marked significant progress.

""What the USA has put on the table here in Berlin in terms of legal and material guarantees is really remarkable. That is a very important step forward, which I very much welcome,"" he said.

""Negotiators from President Trump played a key role, and I want to make this clear: without their tireless efforts and without President Trump's commitment, we would not have the positive momentum we are experiencing here at this very moment,"" Merz said.

Ukraine talks in Berlin have been really positive, with broad consensus emerging on a number of issues, a US official has told the Reuters news agency.

The official said discussions had produced agreement in several areas, while some issues had been delegated to working groups for further talks.

The official praised European participants, saying European representatives had been outstanding, and added that President Trump was pleased with the current state of negotiations.

The official said there was hope the process was on a path to peace.

Security guarantees have made significant progress, according to the official, including work on Article 5-like guarantees.

The official said these guarantees would not remain on the table indefinitely and added that Trump was focused on stopping Russian forces from moving west.

AP news agency reported, also citing the US side, that Russia indicated it is open to Ukraine joining the EU as part of a peace deal.

Ukraine's security service has carried out what it calls a unique special operation in the port of Novorossiysk, using underwater drones to strike a Russian submarine.

The SBU said in a statement on Telegram that underwater drones known as ""Sub Sea Baby"" hit a Project 636.3 submarine, known as the Varshavyanka class, or Kilo class in NATO terminology.

""For the first time in history, underwater drones 'Sub Sea Baby' blew up a Russian Project 636.3 Varshavyanka-class submarine,"" the SBU said.

""As a result of the explosion, the submarine sustained critical damage and has effectively been put out of action.""

The SBU said the submarine was carrying four Kalibr cruise missile launchers, which Russia has used to strike targets in Ukraine.

The latest round of talks between Ukrainian and US officials in Berlin has ended, Ukrainian media have reported.

The top Ukrainian negotiator with the United States has said two days of discussions in Berlin had been ""constructive and productive, with real progress achieved."" 

Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, in a post on X, also thanked US President Trump and praised the US team led by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner for "" working extremely constructively to help Ukraine find a way to a peace agreement that lasts.""

Germany will deepen its commitment to Ukraine's defense through joint ventures, market integration and possible investment guarantees under a 10-point plan unveiled on Monday during  Zelenskyy's visit to Berlin.

""A strong Ukrainian defense industry is crucial for defense against Russia's war of aggression and is an important element of security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression,"" said the document.

Both countries' defense ministries will hold regular, high-level consultations and will cooperate more closely on defense-related research, joint ventures and procurement, with Germany, Ukraine's largest supporter in Europe, looking into the use of federal investment guarantees, according to a statement.

Berlin and Kyiv would also take measures to prevent corruption, the document said, acknowledging concerns about Kyiv's biggest graft scandal of the war that prompted the resignation of two ministers and Zelenskyy's chief of staff.

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier received Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy while the Ukrainian leader is in Berlin for talks with US envoys and European leaders.

Steinmeier welcomed Zelensky at Bellevue Palace, where the two leaders embraced on the steps upon Zelensky's arrival. 

Police cordoned off the area around Bellevue Palace, the president's official residence, while snipers were positioned on the building's roof, and a helicopter circled overhead.

As the head of state, Steinmeier has mainly ceremonial duties while Chancellor Friedrich Merz is responsible for the day-to-day running of the country. Merz is scheduled to host Zelenskyy at an economic forum and talks with other European leaders later on Monday (see entry below for Zelenskyy's schedule in Berlin).

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy took part in talks with US special envoy Steve Wikoff and US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner in Berlin.  

There were no immediate public statements on the talks, which lasted roughly 90 minutes after a five-hour session on Sunday.

An official briefed on the discussions told the AFP news agency the US is continuing to push Ukraine to withdraw from the eastern Donbas region as a condition of peace talks with Russia. Zelenskyy has earlier made clear that such a step is a non-starter for Kyiv. 

""Putin wants territory,"" the official told AFP, adding that Ukraine was ""not agreeing"" to the demand.

""It's a bit striking that the Americans are taking the Russians' position on this issue,"" the official added.

The most recent uptick in international negotiations for an end to Russia's invasion of Ukraine began when Witkoff presented a plan drafted with Russian counterpart Kirill Dmitriev that was widely regarded as favorable to Russia.

That plan was later revised by Zelenskyy and European leaders and presented to the US.

Russia declared the anti-Kremlin feminist protest punk band Pussy Riot ""extremist"" — a label often used in Russia to outlaw critics of President Vladimir Putin. The label makes any interaction with the band, even posts on social media, illegal in Russia

A Moscow court upheld prosecution submissions ""to recognize the punk band Pussy Riot as an extremist organization and ban its activities on the territory of the Russian Federation.""

The ruling makes it easier for authorities to go after the band's supporters inside Russia or people who have worked with them in the past.

Pussy Riot's exiled members have repeatedly spoken out against the Russian war in Ukraine, and the band's songs and videos have been banned in Russia since 2012.

A court in September issued them jail sentences in absentia of up to 13 years after convicting them of telling lies about the Russian army. Pussy Riot gained international notoriety in 2012 after performing an anti-Putin protest in a church.

Leonid Solovyov, the band's lawyer, told the independent outlet SOTAvision that the ruling was ""another action that shuts up those who speak out of turn.""

Band members, long-time opponents of the Kremlin, were expecting the decision.

""The law is designed to erase Pussy Riot from the minds of Russian citizens"" they said on social media last week.

Founding member Nadya Tolokonnikova, who has recently been performing in the United States and whose arrest the Russian authorities are seeking even after having spent two years in jail for the church protest song, shrugged off the move to designate the group as extremist.

""Extremism is invading other countries and committing war crimes. Punks, artists, tricksters, blissful people — they are the voice of common sense in the country,"" she wrote on X late last month.

Most Ukrainians don't see the war ending soon, according to a poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. 

It also found a steep drop in trust of the United States, and that most Ukrainians were committed to endure a longer war in exchange for a better peace deal and a wide majority is against withdrawing from the Donbas region.  

72% of Ukrainians would approve a peace plan that includes freezing the situation behind the current frontline along with security guarantees for Ukraine and without officially recognizing the occupied territories as part of Russia

The results were based on telephone interviews of 547 randomly sampled Ukrainians over the age of 18 in territory controlled by the government in Kyiv.

Russian presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Putin was ""open to peace"" in Ukraine but was against a temporary ceasefire.

""[Putin] is open to peace, to serious peace, to serious decisions,"" Peskov said Monday, according to the state-owned TASS news agency. ""He is absolutely not open to aand creating artificial respites.""

Peskov added that Ukraine refraining from joining the NATO alliance was fundamental to a potential settlement of the war.

""Naturally this issue is one of the cornerstones and, of course, it is subject to special discussion,"" he said.

Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine renounce its NATO ambitions and withdraw troops from about 10% of the Donbas region that Kyiv still controls. The Russian leader has also said Ukraine must be a neutral country and that no NATO troops can be stationed in Ukraine.

Many of the peace terms Putin has sought to dictate have been rejected by Ukrainian officials and have complicated international efforts to ensure Ukraine's security following the Russian invasion.

Peskov said he expected Russia to be updated on the state of talks among Ukrainian and European leaders on Monday in Berlin by the US envoys also in the German capital.

Nearly four years into Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, fighting continued Monday. Russian forces captured the town of Pishchane in Ukraine's eastern Dnipropetrovsk region.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's energy minister said on Monday that Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have left over 430,000 people without power in the Odesa Oblast in southern Ukraine following massive weekend attacks.

Russian forces have repeatedly targeted Ukrainian electricity production with drone and missile strikes as winter temperatures leave people in the cold.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:truthout.org","As Data Centers Proliferate, Will an AI Bubble Lead to a New Recession?","https://truthout.org/articles/as-data-centers-proliferate-will-an-ai-bubble-lead-to-a-new-recession/","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 18:52:17 GMT","

Some AI companies are using techniques and financial products seen in the run-up to the great financial crisis of 2008.

As we produce journalism that combats authoritarianism, censorship, injustice, and misinformation, your support is urgently needed. Please make a year-end gift to Truthout today.

Over the last few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become extremely popular in Silicon Valley and is widely regarded as the most transformative technology in the 21st century. In fact, it is already reshaping sectors like education, transportation, finance, health care, media, and telecommunications. Indeed, it is estimated that about 60 percent of jobs in advanced economies may be impacted by AI, which means that it could affect economic growth, employment, and wages. As a result, investment in AI is booming across industries, echoing the late-1990s dot-com era, with investors pouring billions into AI in the hope for a big payday. Nearly $1.6 trillion has been put into this technology since 2013, and Big Tech companies are expected to add over $400 billion into AI efforts before the year ends, with even bigger spending planned for 2026. 

Unsurprisingly, there are concerns about an AI bubble, and there are indeed some striking similarities between the AI market today and the dot.com bubble of the 1990s that imploded in 2000, resulting in massive losses for investors and the collapse of major companies, with the U.S. economy eventually entering an economic recession in 2001. If the AI bubble were to burst, not only would virtually every company be affected, but the entire economy could collapse like a house of cards. So is the AI boom a looming bubble? What causes bubbles? How do they work? Professor Gerald Epstein, a world-leading authority on banking, finance, and financial crises, addresses these questions in the exclusive interview for Truthout that follows. Epstein is professor of economics and co-director of the Political Economy Research Institute at the University Massachusetts Amherst. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.

C.J. Polychroniou: There are growing concerns about an AI bubble and what may happen if it bursts. In your own view, are we in an AI speculative bubble, and what are the real threats behind a bubble? 

Gerald Epstein: Concerns about AI are certainly understandable. But to be clear on what the true threats (and possible benefits) are and what to do about them, we need to distinguish among the short, medium, and long term. 

In the short term, the potential problem is that our current economic growth and performance generally has gotten far too tied up with the AI boom in capital expenditure. Capital expenditure in new manufacturing plants, equipment, and technology is a major driver of both our current economy — including job creation — and also of our longer-term growth of productivity and the economy overall. In recent months, AI-related expenditures account for a significant percent of our capital expenditures, with most of this being for the building of data centers (more on this in a moment). So, the short-term state of our economy has become highly dependent on one industry, and a new and untested one at that. If that industry were to severely falter, it could lead to a significant short-term decline in the economy overall and even perhaps cause a recession. 

To make the short-term risks even greater, as is often the case with a building frenzy such as AI data centers, a financial frenzy forms around it and makes it riskier for the economy. During the railway building boom in the U.S. in the 19th century, various financial scandals spread, leading to financial crises and bankruptcies. Similarly, with the AI boom, various speculative frenzies, including massive increases in stock values of NVIDIA, the AI chips maker, and speculative lending and borrowing, threaten to destabilize the economy (more on this below).

The medium-term problems include the environmental and industrial problems associated with a massive investment (and perhaps overinvestment) in data centers. These data centers are huge computer server farms that require enormous amounts of energy, water to cool down the computers, and land. Much of the electricity for these centers will come from fossil fuels with obvious disastrous effects on climate change, and will use scarce water in many states. But not only will they take water and energy from other uses and groups in society — they are bidding away all kinds of other goods and inputs from other industries and uses. Just as they are raising the cost of electricity to small businesses, households, and farmers, they are bidding up the prices of computer chips, steel, and other inputs into making AI computers, etc. In other words, they are transforming the whole supply chain and industrial structure, if this growth continues.

In the medium to long term, as AI increasingly is used in the workplace, it is likely to displace workers, leading to more unemployment, eliminating entry-level jobs, and knocking out the lower rungs of job ladders. It is too early to see how this will all play out, but it appears that younger people who need entry-level jobs might initially get most impacted.

Meanwhile, our landscape will be littered with data centers.

What are the common traits in financial bubbles? How do they work? 

Bubbles come in many varieties. First, it is important to distinguish between overbuilding or investment in the “real economy” and “financial bubbles.” The tricky part, though, is that these are often intertwined. In terms of an overbuilding frenzy, the massive AI investment in data centers is often compared to the so-called “dot-com bubble” of the late 1990s. In this case, internet companies such as WorldCom grew rapidly, expanding their internet infrastructure and capacity (the real economy), while at the same time there was a massive run-up in their stock price. The stock prices eventually collapsed, and the company went out of business, but the internet cables and other internet capacity remained. 

The problem with building too much capacity in the internet or AI is that you could sell enough of the output to earn the expected return on your investment. And if you have borrowed money in order to build the data centers, then you have to scramble to get the money to pay off your debts, possible putting stress on the financial system.

The short-term state of our economy has become highly dependent on one industry, and a new and untested one at that.

Of course, “financial bubbles” vary quite a bit, but, building on ideas developed by Hyman Minsky, by looking at hundreds of years of economic history, Charles Kindleberger and his colleagues developed a schema that helps us understand these bubbles. They identified the following sequence: (1) Displacement: Some new idea or project catches on, often due to publicity spread by the press, inside players, or currently the internet; (2) Boom: More wealth is invested in the asset which drives it price higher as more investors catch on; (3) Euphoria: Investors check their caution and rational calculation at the door, and are motivated by FOMO (fear of missing out), and herding to follow the crowd; (4) Profit taking: Some investors wake up to their senses and begin to realize that the returns on these assets no longer justify their high prices; they sell in order to take profits; others see the “overtrading” and begin to bet against the asset, as with “The Big Short” during the great financial crisis of 2008-2009; (5) Panic: As prices stall out and fall, investors panic and rush for the exits, trying to sell their assets as rapidly as possible in an attempt to rescue at least some of their investments. At this point, the asset prices collapse, perhaps all the way to zero.

Already, AI promoters are suggesting that they might need “support” (i.e., a bailout) from the government if confidence in AI's future falters.

The overall size, pace, and destructiveness of these bubbles — both on the way up and on the way down — is much greater if they are fueled by debt or what economists call “leverage.” If you pay $100 for an asset, but borrow $80 to do it (so you only put in $20 of your own wealth into it), if the price of the asset drops by just 50 percent ($50) then you not only lose your whole investment, but you have to come up with $30 someplace else to repay your debt.

Fears of an AI bubble have spread into credit markets. Can you talk a bit about how AI is transforming the finance industry and what the connection is between AI and debt? 

Increasingly, AI companies are borrowing money (issuing debt) to finance their data centers, and even to buy stock in AI companies. By some estimates, they are poised to borrow $1 trillion over the next several years. Some of this money is being borrowed by major companies like Amazon, but smaller companies, hoping to be part of the AI supply chain, are also borrowing significant sums of money. They are even using some of the techniques and financial products that were used in the run-up to the great financial crisis; these include asset-backed securities held off of their balance sheets in “special purpose vehicles” financed by short-term borrowing. These are designed to hide risk and use leverage to increase returns, but they are also very risky. They also create an interconnection between the AI and data center industries with the wider financial system.

Despite warnings and fears of an AI bubble, the market expectation is that AI stocks will continue to surge. Is that rational behavior? Or is it simply capitalist logic at work?

Well, as the Minsky-Kindleberger cycle suggests, market expectations can change rapidly and dramatically. Also, as this theory of bubble cycles suggests, investors suspend their “rationality” when their “euphoria” takes over. As increasing concerns about an “AI bubble” take root, and as some AI firms begin having trouble refinancing their debts because banks and other financiers get cold feet, it is reasonable to expect a “correction.” How big a “correction” and how much spillover there is from it will largely depend on the amount of leverage in the system, and how much hidden risk.

If the AI bubble pops, could it crash the U.S. economy and cause a global recession?

The damage from the “popping” of an AI bubble would depend not only on the amount of leverage and hidden interconnectedness to other firms and sectors, but also on whether the government will bail out the AI sector. 

Already, AI promoters are suggesting that they might need “support” (i.e., a bailout) from the government if confidence in AI's future falters. They say the government would need to bail out the industry to prevent China from winning the AI race. And, despite the speciousness of this argument, they might just get their bailout. This is due, in no small part, to the connections of Donald Trump's supporters (and even some cabinet members) in the AI business. Take, for example, Howard Lutnick, Trump's commerce secretary. According to The New York Times, Lutnick's family promotes foreign investment in data centers that they then broker, help build, and cash in on. This is just one example of the interconnections between Trump world and AI.

So if there is a crash in AI investment, yes, it would put downward pressure on economic activity. But that could be easily managed by more government investment in housing, schools, education, medical research, green energy, and health care. If by some miracle, that were the response, then an AI bubble burst would be a big blessing in not so big a disguise.

December is the most critical time of year for Truthout, because our nonprofit news is funded almost entirely by individual donations from readers like you. So before you navigate away, we ask that you take just a second to support Truthout with a tax-deductible donation.

This year is a little different. We are up against a far-reaching, wide-scale attack on press freedom coming from the Trump administration. 2025 was a year of frightening censorship, news industry corporate consolidation, and worsening financial conditions for progressive nonprofits across the board.

We can only resist Trump's agenda by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

We've set an ambitious target for our year-end campaign — a goal of $250,000 to keep up our fight against authoritarianism in 2026. Please take a meaningful action in this fight: make a one-time or monthly donation to Truthout before December 31. If you have the means, please dig deep.

            The two US Army soldiers killed in Syria on Saturday were Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres Tovar, 25, of Des Moines, Iowa, and Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, 29, of Marshalltown, Iowa, according to the Army. They were both members of the Iowa National Guard.
    


            The Army said in a statement on Monday that the soldiers “died December 13, 2025, in Palmyra, Syria, of injuries sustained while engaged with hostile forces.”
    


            An American civilian interpreter was also killed in the attack, which was carried out by a single ISIS gunman, the Department of Defense said Saturday. Three other Iowa National Guard members were wounded.
    


            President Donald Trump vowed to retaliate, declaring “there will be a lot of damage done to the people that did it” in front of a crowd at a White House Christmas reception Sunday.



            “We had three great patriots terminated by bad people, and not the Syrian government, it was ISIS,” he said, adding that the new president of Syria has “fought by our side.”
    


            The deadly attack comes as Damascus has sought to strengthen ties with the US after the Assad dictatorship was overthrown last year.
    


            US troops have operated for years across multiple locations in Syria as they've trained Syrian partner forces as part of the wider fight against ISIS. American personnel have previously come under attack, and Saturday's incident is the deadliest since a 2019 blast that struck a patrol, killing two US service members and two US civilians.
    


            Pentagon chief spokesperson Sean Parnell said Saturday on X that the soldiers' “mission was in support of on-going counter-ISIS / counter-terrorism operations in the region.”
    


            Roughly 1,800 Iowa Army National Guard soldiers began deploying to the Middle East in late May to support Operation Inherent Resolve, the US mission to defeat ISIS, according to a Saturday statement from Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds' office.
    


            Nathaniel Howard's father, Meskwaki Nation Police Chief Jeffrey Bunn, had shared in a statement posted to Facebook on Saturday that his son was one of the individuals that had been killed.
    


            “Our son Nate was one of the Soldiers that paid the ultimate sacrifice for all of us, to keep us all safer,” Bunn said. “He loved what he was doing and would be the first in and last out, no one left behind. Please pray for our Soldiers all around this cruel world.”
    


            Syrian forces arrested five suspects in connection with the ambush on Sunday, according to Syria's Interior Ministry. The suspects were “immediately placed under investigation,” the ministry said in a statement.

            A jury in Dedham, Massachusetts, convicted Brian Walshe of first-degree murder Monday morning in the 2023 killing of his wife, Ana Walshe, whose body was never found.
    


            The panel deliberated for around six hours before returning its decision. Walshe is expected to be sentenced on Wednesday to life in prison without the possibility of parole – the mandatory punishment for first-degree murder in Massachusetts.
    


            Walshe had no visible reaction when the verdict was read. He had no comment as he was led out of the courthouse in handcuffs and shackles.
    


            Walshe was accused of killing his wife, Ana, on January 1, 2023, hours after ringing in the new year and with their three young children still in the house. Prosecutors said Walshe dismembered her body and disposed of her remains in area dumpsters near their home in Cohasset, Massachusetts.
    


            Before the trial, Walshe pleaded guilty to misleading police and illegally disposing of his wife's body, so he's expected to face additional prison time for those convictions.
    


            The jurors had to believe the murder was deliberately premeditated to convict Walshe of first-degree murder, the most serious homicide charge available in Massachusetts.
    


Brian Walshe faces a first-degree murder charge, but the jury can convict him of a less severe homicide charge. Here's why



            Walshe now faces up to 20 years for misleading police – an enhancement triggered by the murder conviction – and can be sentenced to another three years for pleading guilty to the illegal conveyance of a body.
    


            Norfolk County District Attorney Michael Morrissey thanked the jury for their work on “a very difficult case” and “an incredible effort” on the journey to a conviction in a news conference after the verdict.
    


            “It's not about winning or losing, it's about getting the right answer. And this was the right answer,” Morrissey said.
    


            While the family of Ana Walshe hasn't publicly shared a statement following the verdict, her sister told Morrissey, “Justice has been served.”
    


            Walshe has denied killing his wife, ﻿and his attorneys have said he found her inexplicably dead in their bed that morning.
    


            Ana Walshe, 39, wasn't reported missing until January 4, 2023, when Brian Walshe called her employer in Washington, DC, where she worked and lived part time. Walshe told investigators he hadn't seen his wife since New Year's Day, when he said she left around 6 a.m. to travel back to DC to handle a work emergency.
    


            The prosecution called about 50 witnesses over eight days, including two of Ana's close friends and others who described their interactions with her in the final days of her life. Walshe ultimately chose not to testify, and the defense rested its case without presenting any evidence.
    


            The attorneys for Walshe and the commonwealth gave their closing arguments Friday morning before the jury received the case.
    


            The commonwealth did not offer the jury a theory of how Walshe killed his wife, but prosecutors say it's fair to infer she met a violent death in her family home.
    


            During deliberations Friday, the jury sent a note asking to see a photo of Ana Walshe lying on a rug in the living room of their Cohasset home that prosecutors had submitted as trial evidence.
    


            Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Anne Yas in her closing argument pointed to that rug as evidence of the murder: Investigators recovered pieces of a rug from a dumpster at the apartment complex where Brian Walshe's mother lived. The rug was cut up and covered in Ana's blood, prosecutors say, with a piece of necklace stuck in the fibers.
    


            The commonwealth asserts the bloody rug is the same rug in the photo of Ana before her death. Prosecutors say Brian Walshe threw away that rug, which was covered in blood, and bought a new one at HomeGoods on January 2, 2023.
    


Jury deliberations resume Monday in the Brian Walshe murder trial



            Prosecutors have suggested Walshe was motivated to kill his wife after learning of her monthslong affair with a man she met in DC.
    


            Walshe's defense team, however, says he panicked after discovering her dead in their bed, thinking no one would believe he had nothing to do with her death.
    


            And while defense attorney Larry Tipton argued there's no evidence Walshe knew about his wife's affair before her death, he acknowledged to the jury there's evidence he disposed of Ana's body and then lied to police about it.
    


            Unbeknownst to the jury, Walshe pleaded guilty on the first day of jury selection to the improper conveyance of a body and misleading police – a decision that allowed his attorneys to admit those factors to the panel during the trial.
    


            The defense strategy to admit Walshe disposed of his wife's body and then misled police could effectively take the sting out of the commonwealth's strongest evidence for a first-degree murder conviction, Boston defense attorney J.W. Carney Jr. told CNN.
    


Brian Walshe is on trial for the murder of his wife Ana. Here's a timeline of the case



            During the commonwealth's case, the jury saw digital data revealing extensive internet searches made on Brian Walshe's devices about how to dispose of a body and how to clean up blood – searches his attorney admitted were “dark” and “troubling.”
    


            “They began at 4:52 a.m. on January 1st of 2023, and the first one is, ‘how do you dispose of a body?' It causes chills. It causes disgust,” Tipton said Friday.
    


            But there's no evidence Walshe planned to kill his wife, the defense attorney said – only evidence he reacted after her death.
    


            “Why is the man searching now if he had planned to kill his wife?” Tipton asked. “Where is the evidence of premeditation in thousands of pages of records?”
    


            First-degree murder carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. The jury could have considered second-degree murder, which would have given Walshe parole eligibility.
    


            Separately, Walshe is serving a 37-month prison sentence tied to a federal case from 2018, in which he pleaded guilty to charges connected to selling forged Andy Warhol artwork. That sentence is set to run concurrently with his prison time for the state case connected to his wife's death.
    


            Victim impact statements from Ana Walshe's family are expected to be read at Wednesday's sentencing.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The two Iowa National Guard members killed in a weekend attack that the U.S. military blamed on the Islamic State group in Syria were identified Monday. 

The U.S. Army named them as Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, 25, of Des Moines, and Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, 29, of Marshalltown. 

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds ordered all flags in Iowa to fly at half-staff in their honor, saying that, “We are grateful for their service and deeply mourn their loss.” 

The Pentagon's chief spokesman, Sean Parnell, has said a civilian working as a U.S. interpreter also was killed. Three other Guard members were wounded in the attack, the Iowa National Guard said Monday, with two of them in stable condition and the other in good condition. 

The attack was a major test for the rapprochement between the United States and Syria since the ouster of autocratic leader Bashar Assad a year ago, coming as the U.S. military is expanding its cooperation with Syrian security forces. Hundreds of American troops are deployed in eastern Syria as part of a coalition fighting IS.

The shooting Saturday in the Syrian desert near the historic city of Palmyra also wounded members of the country's security forces and killed the gunman. The assailant had joined Syria's internal security forces as a base security guard two months ago and recently was reassigned amid suspicions that he might be affiliated with IS, a Syrian official said.

The man stormed a meeting between U.S. and Syrian security officials who were having lunch together and opened fire after clashing with Syrian guards, Interior Ministry spokesperson Nour al-Din al-Baba said Sunday. 




Al-Baba acknowledged that the incident was “a major security breach” but said that in the year since Assad's fall, “there have been many more successes than failures” by security forces.

The Army said Monday that the incident is under investigation, but military officials have blamed the attack on an IS member.

President Donald Trump said over the weekend that “there will be very serious retaliation” for the attack and that Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa was “devastated by what happened,” stressing that Syria was fighting alongside U.S. troops. 

Trump welcomed al-Sharaa, who led the lightning insurgency that toppled Assad's rule, to the White House for a historic meeting last month.

Torres-Tovar and Howard were dedicated soldiers and “cherished members” of the Iowa National Guard family, Stephen Osborn, adjutant general, said in a statement. 

“Our focus now is providing unwavering support to their families through this unimaginable time and ensuring the legacy of these two heroes is never forgotten,” Osborn said.

Howard had wanted to be a soldier since he was a young boy, according to Jeffrey Bunn, Howard's stepfather and chief of the Meskwaki Nation Police Department in Tama, Iowa, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) northeast of Des Moines. Howard “loved what he was doing and would be the first in and last out,” Bunn wrote late Saturday in a post on the police department's Facebook page.

Howard also was a loving husband and an “amazing man of faith,” Bunn said, adding that Howard's younger brother, a staff sergeant in the Iowa Guard, would escort “Nate” back to Iowa.

Howard was inspired by his grandfather's service and wanted to serve for 20 years, according to an April post on a Facebook page dedicated to sharing stories of the unit. He had already served for over 11 years.

Howard “wants his battle buddies to know he's always there,” the post said, “whether to help or simply listen.”

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Federal authorities said Monday that they foiled a plot to bomb multiple U.S. companies on New Year's Eve in Southern California, announcing the arrests of members of an extremist anti-capitalist and anti-government group.

The four suspects were arrested Friday as they were testing explosives in the desert east of Los Angeles, First Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said during a news conference.

Officials showed reporters surveillance aerial footage of the four suspects moving a large black object in the desert to a table shortly before their arrests. 

In the criminal complaint, the four suspects named are Audrey Illeene Carroll, 30; Zachary Aaron Page, 32; Dante Gaffield, 24; and Tina Lai, 41. They are all from the Los Angeles area, Essayli said. 

Officials did not describe a motive but said they are members of an offshoot of a pro-Palestinian group dubbed the Turtle Island Liberation Front. Each faces charges including conspiracy and possession of a destructive device, Essayli said, adding that additional charges were expected in coming weeks.

It wasn't immediately clear if they had attorneys and The Associated Press was unable to reach family members.

Essayli said Carroll last month created a detailed plan to bomb five or more locations across Southern California on New Year's Eve and were trying to hit multiple companies. He declined to name the companies but described them as “Amazon-type” logistical centers.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




“Carroll's bomb plot was explicit,” Essayli said. “It included step-by-step instructions to build IEDs... and listed multiple targets across Orange County and Los Angeles.”




The plan included planting backpacks filled with explosive devices at multiple businesses that were set to blow up simultaneously at midnight on New Year's Eve, according to officials and the criminal complaint.

Two of the group's members also had discussed plans for future attacks including targeting Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and vehicles with pipe bombs in 2026, according to the criminal complaint. 

“Carroll stated that some of those plans would quote ‘take some of them out and scare the rest,'” Essayli said. 

The plans were discussed both at an in-person meeting with members in Los Angeles and through an encrypted messaging app, Essayli said. 

Evidence photos included in the court documents show a desert campsite with what investigators said were bomb-making materials strewn across plastic folding tables. 

The suspects “all brought bomb-making components to the campsite, including various sizes of PVC pipes, suspected potassium nitrate, charcoal, charcoal powder, sulfur powder, and material to be used as fuses, among others,” the complaint states.

The plan stated that the backpacks would contain complex pipe bombs and included instructions on how to manufacture them and also how to avoid leaving evidence behind tracing anything back to the group, officials said. The suspects recently had acquired precursor chemicals and other items, they added. 

Last week they were rehearsing their attack and testing devices in the desert near Twentynine Palms, California, before federal authorities moved in, officials said. 

“They had everything they needed to make an operational bomb at that location,” he said. 

Authorities issued search warrants and found posters for the Turtle Island Liberation Front at Carroll's home that called for “Death to America,” and “Death to ICE,” Essayli said. In Page's residence, police found a copy of the detailed bomb plan, he added. 

Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said while federal and local officials disagree on the Trump administration's immigration raids, they come together still to protect residents. The LAPD does not stop people or take action for any reason related to immigration status, and it doesn't enforce immigration laws, a practice that has been in place for 45 years.

“The successful disruption of this plot is a powerful testament to the strength of our unified response,” McDonnell said. 

The suspects, who were taken into custody without incident, were scheduled to appear in court in Los Angeles Monday afternoon.

BERLIN (AP) — The U.S. has agreed to provide unspecified security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal to end Russia's nearly four-year war, and more talks are likely this weekend, U.S. officials said Monday following the latest discussions with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.

The officials said talks with President Donald Trump's envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, led to narrowing differences on security guarantees that Kyiv said must be provided, as well as Moscow's demand that Ukraine concede land in the Donbas region in the country's east.

Trump was expected to dial into a dinner Monday evening with negotiators and European leaders, and more talks are likely this weekend in Miami or elsewhere in the United States, according to the U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly by the White House.

The U.S. officials said the offer of security guarantees won't be on the table “forever.” They said the Trump administration plans to put forward the agreement on security guarantees for Senate approval, although they didn't specify whether it would be ratified like a treaty, which needs the chamber's two-thirds approval.

The U.S. officials also said there is consensus on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan, and that Russia has indicated it is open to Ukraine joining the European Union, something it previously said it did not object to.




German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the Ukrainians, Americans and Europeans agree that “a ceasefire should be secured by substantial legal and material security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe,” calling it a “truly far-reaching, substantial agreement that we did not have before, namely that both Europe and the U.S. are jointly prepared to do this.”

Questions over Ukraine's postwar security and the fate of occupied territories have been the main obstacles in talks. Zelenskyy has emphasized that any Western security assurances would need to be legally binding and supported by the U.S. Congress.

Zelenskyy on Monday called talks “substantial” and noted that differences remain on the issue of territories.

Zelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine's bid to join the NATO military alliance if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to NATO members. But Ukraine's preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression.

Ukraine has continued to reject the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of Donetsk region still under its control as a key condition for peace.

The Russian president has cast Ukraine's bid to join NATO as a major threat to Moscow's security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine renounce the bid for alliance membership as part of any prospective peace settlement.

Asked whether the negotiations could be over by Christmas, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said trying to predict a potential time frame for a peace deal was a “thankless task.”

“I can only speak for the Russian side, for President Putin,” Peskov said. “He is open to peace, to a serious peace and serious decisions. He is absolutely not open to any tricks aimed at stalling for time.”

Putin has denied plans to attack any European allies.

Russia fired 153 drones of various types at Ukraine overnight Sunday into Monday, according to Ukraine's Air Force, which said 133 drones were neutralized, while 17 more hit their targets.

In Russia, the Defense Ministry on Monday said forces destroyed 130 Ukrainian drones overnight. An additional 16 drones were destroyed between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. local time.

Eighteen drones were shot down over Moscow itself, the defense ministry said. Flights were temporarily halted at the city's Domodedovo and Zhukovsky airports as part of safety measures, officials said.

Damage details and casualty figures were not immediately available.

Fox News Digital spoke to State Sen. Mark Koran, former prosecutor Joe Teirab, and columnist Dustin Grage about how claims of ‘racism' shielded fraud within the Somali community in Minneapolis.

The ongoing investigations into fraud in the Somali community in Minnesota have another chilling angle: possible links to jihad.

President Donald Trump's new national security strategy wants to move on from the days when the Middle East dominated foreign policy. But the Minnesota welfare fraud schemes are a warning sign. Closing the door on radical Islam's ideology – and its greedy tentacles here in America – may be harder than it looks.

EXPERT REVEALS KEY FACTOR THAT LED TO MASSIVE MINNESOTA FRAUD SCHEME

Treasury Secretary Scott BessentScott Bessent was worried enough to launch an investigation into whether money was transferred from Minnesota to the infamous al-Shabaab jihadist group in Somalia.

""A lot of money has been transferred from the individuals who committed this fraud,"" Bessent told Margaret Brennan on ""Face the Nation"" earlier this month. Much of that money ""has gone overseas, and we are tracking that both to the Middle East and to Somalia to see what the uses of that have been,"" he said.

The main motive, of course, was ""pure, unmitigated greed,"" as U.S. District Judge Nancy E. Brasel said in her Aug. 6 sentencing of Abdiaziz Shafii Farah, who was convicted in a $250 million fraud scheme that exploited a federally funded child nutrition program during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the question is whether the sheer volume of remittances to Somalia may have directly or indirectly benefited terror networks.

TRUMP REWRITES NATIONAL SECURITY PLAYBOOK AS MASS MIGRATION OVERTAKES TERRORISM AS TOP US THREAT

Remittances are the target. Somalia's GDP in 2024 was just $12 billion. Cash flows from the U.S. to Somalia totaled about $215 million last year. ISIS in Somalia runs a digital hawala network financing operations across Africa to fund terrorism, according to an Oct. 7 report from the Africa Defense Forum.

Americans aren't the only ones dealing with fraud, suspicious money flows and worries about terrorist ties.

On Nov. 24, the Swedish newspaper Expressen reported that over $100 million in Swedish taxpayer kronor intended for preschools and schools in Sweden was instead siphoned off by an Islamist network running a welfare fraud scheme. It's a network united by common family ties, criminal business and welfare crimes, according to Expressen. Swedish police also rounded up several individuals linked to radical and violent extremism at an apartment north of Stockholm. Expressen concluded that two networks engaged in pure, large-scale welfare crime for significant sums.

HOW MISREADING SOMALI POVERTY LED MINNESOTA INTO ITS LARGEST WELFARE SCANDAL

""The money disappears and does not fulfill its social purpose, while others get rich by appropriating public funds,"" Gothenburg Economic Crime Authority Chief Prosecutor Henric Fagher told the Swedish news site.

Beyond the disgust at large-scale fraud, concerns remain about terrorist recruiting and radicalization. In one well-known case, 30 ISIS fighters traveled from Gothenburg to Syria in 2013. Eventually, 300 Swedes joined jihadi groups, according to The Guardian, making Sweden second only to Belgium as a recruiting source. In 2023, 24 ex-ISIS fighters were found to be working as public employees in Sweden.

Americans have reason to be concerned. A year ago, 23-year-old Abdisatar Ahmed Hassan tried twice to leave Minnesota to join ISIS in the Islamic State in Somalia. He was arrested and pleaded guilty on Sept. 29 to attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. Millions of dollars of welfare fraud taking place alongside known cases of ISIS radicalization is flat-out scary. ""There is no margin for error when it comes to terrorism,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson said in a statement.

Finally, the Somali fraud schemes are yet another reminder that the overall U.S. refugee and asylum policy must be re-examined. Time was when asylum policy reflected U.S. national interests, like absorbing those who fled the Soviet Union. Asylum policy went adrift after the Cold War.

As the new national security strategy says, ""who a country admits into its borders — in what numbers and from where — will inevitably define the future of that nation.""

The tragic shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., on the day before Thanksgiving should have been enough of a warning.

Admitting waves of refugees is not a sustainable policy.

Chef Eric Levine, owner of 317 Main Street, shares his tips and tricks to making homemade bread on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'

Having digestive issues? While experts often caution that eating bread will make these issues worse, there's an exception.

British researchers published new guidelines earlier this fall about foods that can relieve constipation.

King's College London said in a news release that the research is the ""first-ever evidence-based dietary guidelines for adults with chronic constipation.""

EASY NUTRITION TWEAK COULD TRANSFORM YOUR SLEEP — STARTING THIS EVENING

The main recommendations are kiwi, mineral water and — surprisingly — rye bread.

""Our guidelines found that there simply isn't enough evidence to suggest [that fiber] actually works in constipation specifically. Instead, our research reveals some new dietary strategies that could indeed help patients,"" study author Eirini Dimidi said in the October news release. 

Rye bread may ease digestive issues, say researchers. This challenges long-held beliefs about bread and gut health. (iStock)

""At the same time, we urgently need more high-quality trials to strengthen the evidence on what works and what doesn't.""

Rye bread's high fiber content ""sets it apart from other breads,"" said Dr. Roshini Raj, a New York City-based gastroenterologist (she was not involved in the study).

""In this study, they compared rye bread to white bread, and only rye bread helped constipation,"" Raj said.

""White bread is low in fiber and also contains refined flour, which can worsen constipation.""

The new study compared rye to white bread — and found clear benefits only from the rye variety. (iStock)

Raj said rye bread also contains both soluble and insoluble fiber.

This all helps ""both stool consistency and stool frequency by adding bulk to the stool and drawing water into the intestine.""

The ""Gut Renovation"" author also noted that rye contains iron, magnesium, zinc and B vitamins, which support everything from energy production to immune health and cognitive function.

Experts say pairing rye with more water and fiber-rich foods can further support digestive function. (iStock)

For those choosing to add rye bread to their diets, Raj cautioned that it should be done slowly, as it can cause bloating.

""There are many high-fiber foods, not just rye bread — so aim to get a variety to ensure you are not only getting fiber, but other nutrients as well,"" she said. 

""Increasing water intake is also helpful for constipation.""

TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ

Debra Muth, a naturopathic doctor (ND) based in Wisconsin, who was also not involved in the study, added that rye ""stabilizes blood sugar, keeps you full longer, feeds the microbiome and delivers minerals your body actually needs.""

She added, ""Most breads today are made from refined flour that's been stripped of fiber, so they make constipation worse, rather than better.""

Rye bread is higher in fiber and lower on the glycemic index, making it more gut-friendly, a doctor told Fox News Digital. (iStock)

""Rye is different. It's higher in fiber, lower on the glycemic index and far more gut-friendly. It's one of the few breads that actually supports motility instead of shutting it down.""

To start eating more rye bread, Muth recommended rye toast — but look out for real rye bread made with rye flour, she said, not wheat bread that's been dyed brown.

""It's important to investigate why you're constipated in the first place,"" she added. 

""Yes, constipation is inconvenient, but it's a signal. Your body is telling you something's off.""

EXCLUSIVE — The Department of Housing and Urban Development has sent federal investigators into Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, to examine federally administered aid programs following the discovery of a massive welfare fraud scheme believed to have been carried out by Somali immigrants.

A HUD spokesperson told the Washington Examiner that the department is the latest federal entity, following Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to send in its own staff to ensure HUD-funded programs are being carried out appropriately.

The HUD official said the department is putting the region “on notice, that we are taking enforcement and fiscal oversight seriously given the rampant fraud.”

HUD's Washington headquarters will also be reviewing data from Minnesota's public housing authorities to ensure all federal housing programs are not being defrauded.

The Minneapolis Public Housing Authority spends $108 million annually on housing choice vouchers and public housing, while St. Paul spends $46 million.

The arrival of HUD personnel comes after $1 billion in taxpayer money was siphoned from the state's social services programs to line the pockets of primarily Somali descendants in the region. The Treasury Department said it is looking into whether the money also went to a terrorist group, al Shabaab.

The primary scandal involved Feeding Our Future, a nonprofit organization that claimed to have provided millions of meals to children during the pandemic and received $300 million in reimbursement.

HUD Secretary Scott Turner said Saturday evening that the department has cut funding for Somalis who have temporary protected status.

TPS is a legal status that illegal immigrants from certain countries may apply for, and if granted, they will be protected from deportation for two years on the basis that the country of origin is not stable enough to repatriate them.

“Illegal immigration and the housing affordability crisis are directly correlated,” Turner posted Sunday on X. “Fix one, you fix the other. That's exactly what we are doing under the leadership of @POTUS.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Federal authorities disrupted what the Justice Department described as a “massive and horrific” terrorist plot targeting Los Angeles on New Year's Eve, arresting multiple alleged members of a left-wing extremist group accused of planning coordinated bombings across Southern California.

Attorney General Pam Bondi announced on Monday that the DOJ, working with the FBI, prevented a series of planned attacks by a group that calls itself the Turtle Island Liberation Front, which officials characterized as pro-Palestinian, anti-government, anti-capitalist, and hostile toward law enforcement.

After an intense investigation, the Department of Justice, working with our @FBI, prevented what would have been a massive and horrific terror plot in the Central District of California (Orange County and Los Angeles).The Turtle Island Liberation Front—a far-left,…

“After an intense investigation, the Department of Justice, working with our FBI, prevented what would have been a massive and horrific terror plot in the Central District of California,” Bondi said in a statement posted to X. She added that the group planned bombings beginning on New Year's Eve and intended to target Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and vehicles.

According to federal authorities, four alleged members of the group were arrested over the weekend in Lucerne Valley, a desert area northeast of Los Angeles, where authorities believe they were preparing to test improvised explosive devices ahead of the planned attacks. Each of the four members has been charged with conspiracy and possession of a destructive device.

The suspects identified themselves as part of a radical offshoot of the Turtle Island Liberation Front and were allegedly plotting coordinated IED attacks on five separate locations in Los Angeles. Bondi described the group as motivated by pro-Palestinian, anti-law-enforcement, and anti-government ideology.

Federal authorities said on Monday that a fifth individual believed to be connected to the same extremist network was arrested in New Orleans, according to Fox News. That suspect is accused of planning a separate attack and faces related federal charges, according to the FBI.

Public social media posts linked to the Turtle Island Liberation Front reflect the group's ideological framework. An Instagram account attributed to the groups says its founding chapter is based in Los Angeles and calls for the liberation of “Turtle Island,” an Indigenous term often used to describe North America, from what it describes as the “illegal American empire.”

“Free Palestine. Free Hawaii. Free Puerto Rico,” the account says. Other posts feature images of masked demonstrators wearing keffiyehs and holding signs that say “DEATH TO ICE!!!” and denounce U.S. law enforcement and capitalism.

A post shared by Turtle Island Liberation Front (@turtleislandliberationfrontla)

One post declares that “freeing the world from American imperialism is the only way to a safe and peaceful future.”

Bondi praised the work of federal prosecutors and investigators in stopping the alleged plot before it could be carried out, calling the operation an example of aggressive counterterrorism enforcement.

“This was an incredible effort by our U.S. Attorneys' Offices and the FBI to ensure Americans can live in peace,” she said. “We will continue to pursue these terror groups and bring them to justice.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","What we know so far about the Brown University shooting","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/crime/3917647/what-we-know-brown-university-shooting/","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 13:42:08 GMT","

A sweeping manhunt to locate the suspect who carried out a mass shooting at Brown University is stretching into its third day.

The shooter gunned down students studying for finals, killing two and injuring nine in Providence, Rhode Island, on Saturday afternoon. Authorities initially detained a person of interest but revealed late Sunday that they are releasing the 24-year-old man due to a lack of evidence, meaning the suspect remains at large.

More than 400 law enforcement officers, including FBI and ATF agents, are searching for the suspect. Authorities have struggled to identify a male dressed in all black, based on university video footage that did not appear to capture a face. The man is believed to have fled on foot.

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha had a tense exchange with reporters on Sunday when one questioned why there were not enough cameras at Brown University to catch the gunman.

“There just weren't a lot of cameras in that Brown building, is the reality,” Neronha said. “I mean, we're not holding back a video that we think would be useful. And I don't think I should even have to say it. … I don't know what to tell you, but we're going to go out and find whatever evidence we can to solve this case as quickly as we can.”

Federal law enforcement officers initially detained Benjamin Erickson, a 24-year-old Army veteran from Wisconsin who appeared to hold ties to Washington, D.C., as the primary person of interest in the mass shooting.

After Erickson was detained at a hotel in Coventry, Rhode Island, overnight, Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez said Sunday that authorities were confident he was the gunman and charges could be filed soon.

But later that day, the investigation took a twist when officials announced that Erickson would be released, with Neronha revealing that evidence “now points in a different direction.” Mayor Brett Smiley said they are looking for “additional video evidence” as the primary university surveillance footage did not appear to reveal his face.

The tip that led to the 24-year-old being detained was fielded by the FBI, Perez said late Sunday.

“It was actually picked up by the FBI, and they followed through with it, and they ended up coming and locating this individual of interest,” Perez said.

Gov. Daniel McKee (D-RI) said he regretted that Erickson faced so much attention and that the investigation would proceed more carefully.

“That was really unfortunate,” he said. “It's hard to put that back in the bottle.”

Authorities must now review all the evidence, former FBI Special Agent Steve Moore told CNN's Rosemary Church.

“No investigation is perfect, and you're going to go through ups and downs,” he said after the “error” was made in detaining Erickson. “So you pretty much have to throw out, not the evidence, but the conclusions from the evidence. … And you start, basically, as if you're seeing the evidence for the first time and say, ‘Where should this lead us?'”

Brown University's Department of Public Safety has more than doubled its staffing following the deadly shooting, according to the school.

Colleges must balance the need for security with the educational mission, Rob Kilfoyle, president of the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators and director of public safety and emergency management at Humber Polytechnic in Toronto, told the Washington Post.

“That's probably one of the toughest things that we have to do in campus public safety, is find that equilibrium between not wanting it to seem oppressive and too restrictive, but also providing sufficient security,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The parent company of Roomba, which has sold millions of cleaning robots, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday after 35 years of operation.

In a Sunday press release, Massachusetts-based robotics company iRobot said it had filed for bankruptcy protection in the District of Delaware court.

The company said that it would be wholly acquired by its main manufacturer and lender, vacuum cleaner maker Shenzhen PICEA. Picea has R&D and manufacturing facilities in China and Vietnam, per the release.

The Picea deal would allow iRobot to continue operating, developing new products, make ""timely payments to vendors and creditors,"" and meet its commitments to employees, the release said.

Under the deal, iRobot will be a private company owned by Picea, and its common stock will be wiped from stock exchanges.

iRobot was founded in 1990 by three roboticists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The company introduced the Roomba, its iconic disc-shaped vacuuming robot, in 2002.

The bankruptcy deal follows several quarters of weak sales and a cash crunch. The company wrote in its third-quarter earnings report that, as of September 27, its cash totaled $24.8 million, compared to $40.6 million as of June 28.

iRobot said it had withdrawn $5 million in restricted cash on September 27, after which it had ""no sources upon which it can draw for additional capital.""

Its third-quarter revenue, $145.8 million, was about a 25% drop compared to the same period the year before, with sales dropping 33% in the US.

Last month, the company warned that the last possible iRobot buyer had backed out of a deal, which left it likely to pursue bankruptcy. 

iRobot went through a failed acquisition attempt by Amazon. In 2022, Amazon announced that it would buy iRobot for $1.7 billion, but pulled the deal in January 2024, citing regulatory hurdles in the US and Europe.

The collapse of the Amazon deal hit iRobot hard. On the same day as Amazon's announcement, iRobot said it would lay off 31% of its staff, and its CEO, Colin Angle, would step down.

iRobot's stock price has dropped more than 50% in the past year and more than 90% in the past five years.

Actor-director and political activist Rob Reiner and his wife were found dead in their Los Angeles home on Sunday, and police are investigating the circumstances as an apparent homicide, authorities said.

While police declined to publicly identify the two people found deceased, Mayor Karen Bass and California Governor Gavin Newsom each released statements confirming that Reiner, 78, and his wife, Michele, 68, had died.

""This is a devastating loss for our city and our country. Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,"" the mayor wrote.

The Los Angeles Police Department issued a statement on social media calling the case an ""apparent homicide."" Police had not detained anyone for questioning nor identified a suspect as of Sunday night, Deputy Chief Alan Hamilton told a press conference.

LAPD patrol officers dispatched to the home late Sunday afternoon discovered two bodies inside the residence. Emergency personnel had first responded to a call for medical aid, a city fire department official said earlier.

Detectives of the LAPD's robbery-homicide unit were waiting for a search warrant before entering the home to conduct a thorough search and full-fledged investigation of the premises, Hamilton said, adding that a cause of death will be made public by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office.

As an actor, Reiner was best remembered for his role on the 1970s CBS television comedy hit ""All in the Family"" as Mike ""Meathead"" Stivic, the son-in-law and liberal foil of the lead character, working-class bigot Archie Bunker, played by Carroll O'Connor.

The role garnered Reiner two Emmy awards for outstanding supporting actor.

Reiner went on to have a prolific Hollywood career as a director, starting with ""This is Spinal Tap,"" a 1984 mockumentary following the trials and tribulations of a fictional hard rock band on tour. The satiric film became a cult classic, known for its mostly improvised script, with Reiner playing the faux documentary filmmaker Marty DiBergi.

The movie worked, Reiner later said, because of the cast's love for rock 'n' roll.

""That was the trick - to make fun of it and at the same time, honor it,"" Reiner told CBS News show ""60 Minutes"" in an interview marking the launch of this year's sequel, ""Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,"" which he also directed and appeared in.

Reiner directed nearly two dozen films in all, including classics such as ""Stand by Me,"" a 1986 coming-of-age drama about four boys who set out to find the body of a missing youth, as well as 1989's ""When Harry Met Sally ...,"" starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.

That film, often cited as one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time, featured the famed line, ""I'll have what she's having,"" delivered by the director's real-life mother, Estelle Reiner, playing a bit part as a diner reacting to Ryan's character faking an orgasm in a restaurant.

Versatile across a range of genres, Reiner directorial credits also included the 1987 fairy tale adventure ""The Princess Bride,"" the 1990 psychological thriller ""Misery,"" an adaptation of a Stephen King novel starring Kathy Bates and James Caan, and the 1992 military courtroom drama ""A Few Good Men,"" starring Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise and Demi Moore.

Reiner's wife, Michele, was at one time a photographer who captured the image of Donald Trump that appears on the cover of his book ""Trump: The Art of the Deal.""

Rob Reiner, a native of New York City and the son of the late comedy writer and actor Carl Reiner, was also well known as a Democratic Party activist and advocate of various liberal social causes.

In the 2004 presidential election, he backed Democratic candidate John Kerry and featured in advertisements taking aim at incumbent President George W. Bush. Reiner also supported Democratic presidential hopefuls Al Gore and Hillary Clinton.

He campaigned against California Proposition 8, a 2008 ballot measure that amended the state constitution to ban same-sex marriages. Prop 8 was later overturned by the courts and formally repealed by another voter initiative.

He led a separate campaign to pass Proposition 10, a state ballot initiative that created an early childhood development services program.

Reiner was first married to Penny Marshall, who played Laverne in the TV sitcom ""Laverne & Shirley,"" and was also a producer and director. He was an adoptive father to Marshall's daughter and had three children with Michele Singer.

Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) continued to lean aggressively into Bitcoin (BTC-USD), stepping up purchases for a second consecutive week as prices pulled back. Between Dec. 8 and Dec. 14, the company acquired $980.3 million worth of Bitcoin, its largest weekly purchase since July and the second straight week of adding more than 10,000 coins to its balance sheet, something it had not done since January. The move reinforces Strategy's positioning as a dedicated digital asset treasury company at a moment when volatility has returned to the crypto market.

The bulk of the latest buying was funded through at-the-market sales of Class A common stock, alongside sales from three of its four classes of perpetual preferred shares. That funding approach has revived concerns among critics who argue repeated equity issuance could be dilutive and may be pressuring the premium the shares trade at versus the firm's roughly $59 billion Bitcoin holdings. Shares fell about 6.7% to $164.60 in New York trading, while Bitcoin declined around 1.8% to $86,885, leaving the cryptocurrency roughly 30% below its early October peak of just over $126,000.

Attention has also shifted to index dynamics. After speculation about a potential removal, the Nasdaq 100 decided late Friday to keep Strategy in the index following its annual reconstitution, easing fears of near-term forced selling. Separately, the company has urged MSCI to abandon a proposal that could remove digital asset treasury firms whose crypto holdings exceed half of total assets from global equity benchmarks, warning of potentially harmful consequences if adopted. MSCI is expected to announce its decision by Jan. 15, a date that could be closely watched as Strategy's shares continue to trade at a premium of about 1.1 times enterprise value.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

Veteran trader and chart analyst Peter Brandt has warned that bitcoin's BTC$86,456.82 signature growth parabola has fractured, opening the door to a brutal slide potentially down to $25,000. 

Brandt's call hinges on exponential decay in bitcoin's bull cycles. The cryptocurrency has historically rallied hard in 12-18 months after halving and subsequently slipped into a bear market, characterized by 70% to 80% pullback from record highs. 

However, each bull cycle has seen diminishing returns. For instance, following the first halving on Nov. 28, 2012, BTC chalked out a 100-fold rise to $1,240 by December 2013. The 2016 halving produced a 74-fold rise and the 2020 halving brought an eight-fold rise. 

The latest post-halving cycle, which kicked off following the quadrennial event in April 2024, saw prices double to a record high of $126,000 by October this year. Since then, prices have pulled back to just under $90,000, slicing through the parabola curve that has marked massive price uptrends during each prior cycle.

""The current parabolic advance has been violated. 20% of ATH = $25,240,"" Brandt said on X. 

Brandt lays it out on a log-scale chart stretching back to 2010: four steepening pink arcs, each tracing a cycle's manic vertical climb. Parabolas don't bend gently, they accelerate skyward, just like BTC's history of rapid gains. 

Meanwhile, crosses below that support line have marked end of bull runs. The slide from October highs has done that, knifing under the fourth arc.

Publicly traded Ethereum treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) added another 102,259 ETH valued around $320 million in the last week, the firm announced on Monday. 

The firm now holds 3,967,210 ETH, valued at more than $12.4 billion in ETH. It also holds 193 BTC worth around $17 million, and has $1 billion in cash. 

“BitMine continues to add steadily to its ETH holdings, adding 102,259 ETH in the past week. Crypto prices have stabilized in the past week, further evidence that crypto prices have begun to recover after the price shock of October 10th,” said BitMine Chairman Tom Lee, in a statement.

""2025 saw many positive developments in digital assets including positive legislation passed by the U.S. Congress and favorable regulations, and by strengthening support from Wall Street,” he continued. “These strengthen our conviction that the best days for crypto are ahead and why we continue to accumulate ETH towards our 'alchemy of 5%' target.""

BitMine's latest acquisition continues an aggressive string of purchases in which the firm has added to its position as the leading ETH treasury firm, amid wobbling ETH prices. 

In the firm's previous purchase, disclosed last week, it bought around $429 million of ETH—its largest acquisition since October.

According to Lee, the firm is putting “its money where its mouth is,” adding that BitMine believes that ETH has already bottomed for the year. In other words, Lee and his firm think that Ethereum has already hit its lowest price point this year.

Beyond buying ETH, the firm is also making progress on a bespoke staking solution called The Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN), which will allow it to earn yield on its holdings.

In a recent video interview with Farokh Sarmad—president of Dastan, Decrypt's parent company—Lee noted that the firm could make as much as $400 million in staking revenue annually from its holdings. 

Shares of BMNR are down nearly 7% since the opening bell on Monday, recently changing hands at $32.48. Since hitting a yearly peak of $161 on June 30, BMNR shares have now dropped nearly 80%. 

ETH is down more than 2% in the last 24 hours, recently trading hands at $3,010.

Oops, something went wrong

A so-called Santa rally is looking less and less likely, with prices for top assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP falling sharply on Monday, hitting their lowest prices in at least a week as liquidations piled up across the board.

Bitcoin was recently down more than 3% over the last 24 hours, falling from a mark of nearly $90,000 early Monday to a recent price of $85,833. That's the lowest price registered for the leading crypto asset since December 1, per data from CoinGecko.

Ethereum, meanwhile, was down about more than 4% to a price of $2,955, with XRP falling 4.5% to $1.90—its lowest mark so far in December. Over the last week, every coin in the top 10 assets by market cap is down, aside from dollar-pegged stablecoins.

Monday's rough start to the new week has led to a smattering of crypto liquidations, tallying $573 million over the last day, per data from CoinGlass. Long positions, or bets that an asset's price will rise, make up the majority of the mess with $486 million worth.

Bitcoin is currently leading the pack for liquidations with $205 million in total, with Ethereum not too far behind at $156 million.

Overall, the crypto market has shed more than 3% of its value over the last 24 hours. Stock market indices aren't showing nearly as bad of a hit on Monday, however, with the S&P 500 dipping 0.1% and the Nasdaq down by about 0.3%.

Strategy Adds Nearly a Billion Dollars in Bitcoin for Second Straight Week

Crypto stocks, on the other hand, are showing more substantial losses, with Bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK) down 15% on the day, crypto exchange Gemini (GEMI) falling 12%, and top Ethereum treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies dropping 8% so far on the day. Coinbase has fallen by more than 5%, with Robinhood showing a less than 2% dip so far Monday.

Users on Myriad—a prediction market platform owned by Decrypt's parent company, Dastan—are growing increasingly bearish on the prospects of a Santa rally next week, currently giving that a less than 8% likelihood of happening. That's down from nearly 20% odds a week ago.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

JPMorgan Chase, a global bank with $4 trillion of assets under management, is rolling out a tokenized money-market fund on Ethereum, pushing deeper into blockchain-based finance amid growing demand from institutional clients.

The move marks JPMorgan's first tokenized money market fund, making it the largest GSIB, or Global Systemically Important Banks, to launch such a vehicle on a public blockchain, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.

The fund, dubbed My OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY), is seeded with $100 million from the bank's asset management division and is set to open to external, qualified investors this week, the Wall Street Journal reported first.

The global bank joins a wave of high-profile financial giants launching tokenized funds on blockchain, with money-market funds leading the charge. Franklin Templeton was among the first traditional finance firms with its BENJI fund in 2021. Then, BlackRock started its BUIDL fund in 2024 with tokenization specialist Securitize, attracting $2 billion in assets to date, per RWA.xyz data.

These vehicles allow investors to park idle cash on blockchains to earn a yield — like with a money market fund but with faster settlement times, around-the-clock trading and real-time visibility into ownership. Increasingly, they are also used as a reserve asset for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and as collateral in trading and asset management. 

The asset class has grown to $9 billion from $3 billion in a year, RWA.xyz data shows. The broader tokenized asset market is projected to grew to $18.9 trillion by 2033, BCG and Ripple said in a report.

""There is a massive amount of interest from clients around tokenization, John Donohue, head of global liquidity at JPMorgan Asset Management, told WSJ.

JPMorgan built MONY on Kinexys Digital Assets, the bank's in-house tokenization platform. The product will likely serve as a test case for expanding the bank's lineup of onchain offerings. 

""Tokenization can fundamentally change the speed and efficiency of transactions, adding new capabilities to traditional products,"" Donohue said in a statWe believe that financial products will increasingly transact this way, and we're excited about the opportunities this creates for our clients and for the whole industry.” Donohue said.

Like traditional money-market funds, MONY is set to hold short-term debt instruments and pays interest daily. Investors can redeem shares using either cash or Circle's USDC stablecoin. The fund will be accessible to qualified investors, with a $1 million minimum investment.

Here's what that means","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bittensor-ai-linked-cryptocurrency-founded-151323479.html","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 15:13:23 GMT","

Oops, something went wrong

Early on Monday, the supply of new cryptocurrency tied to Bittensor—a decentralized network of AI projects—dropped by half. The halving was the first the currency has experienced and came about by design, reflecting how Bittensor shares the same anti-inflationary architecture as Bitcoin. The event also serves a milestone for one of the most novel and ambitious cryptocurrencies to launch in years.

Currently, Bittensor has a market capitalization of $2.7 billion, according to the crypto analytics site CoinGecko. That pales in comparison to Bitcoin but is number 50 on the list of most popular cryptocurrencies. It also enjoys the backing of influential crypto billionaire Barry Silbert. At a time when AI is dominating the economy and the political discourse, Bittensor offers the promise of a decentralized alternative to Big Tech—provided it can keep picking up traction in the crypto world and beyond, and if its price holds up following the new drop in supply.

Here's an overview of exactly what Bittensor is, who's betting on its success, and what some crypto prognosticators say will come next after its halving:

Founded by Jacob Steeves, a former Google engineer, in 2019, Bittensor is designed to repurpose the mechanics of Bitcoin for AI. In the world of Bitcoin, owners of fleets of computer servers leverage their processing power to process and secure cryptocurrency transactions. This is called Bitcoin mining.

Similarly, Steeves devised a system where fleets of computers compete to process AI computations. In exchange for their processing power, these “miners” receive Bittensor's cryptocurrency, TAO. In aggregate, Bittensor is like a decentralized server farm for AI. “How did we create a supercomputer that is bigger than any government or corporation can create with a centralized entity?” Steeves said to Fortune in 2024.

Bittensor isn't the most easily understood tech, but the protocol has had some serious backers. In 2024, the crypto venture capitalist Polychain held around $200 million of the cryptocurrency, another crypto VC Dao5 held $50 million, and the crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group had around $100 million

Barry Silbert, the billionaire founder of Digital Currency Group, is such a believer in Bittensor that he's founded his own startup called Yuma that's dedicated to the cryptocurrency. “It is the thing that I've gotten most excited about since Bitcoin,” he said.

On Monday at 8:30 a.m. New York time, Bittensor reduced the amount of daily tokens it issues from 7,200 to 3,600. Like Bitcoin, the supply of Bittensor's cryptocurrency is capped at 21 million.

In a research note, analysts at Grayscale, a crypto ETF issuer and a subsidiary of Barry Silbert's Digital Currency Group, said that the halving could be a “positive catalyst for price.” Just a week before, the ETF issuer announced that trading in the U.S. had begun for a vehicle that gives investors exposure to Bittensor.

Sami Kassab, managing partner at Unsupervised Capital, a hedge fund dedicated to Bittensor, was similarly optimistic. “Halvings aren't complicated. Historically, halvings have been bullish because there's simply less inventory hitting the market, “ he said. “The same logic applies to TAO.”

Still, over the past 24 hours, the price of Bittensor's cryptocurrency has dropped about 5.5% to $272. That doesn't mean the halving was a bust since the market often prices in such events ahead of time and, in the case Bitcoin, has often spurred subsequent booms. When Bitcoin last halved in April 2024, its price hovered around $65,000 shortly afterwards. But, by the end of the year, the world's largest cryptocurrency had rocketed to above $100,000.

This is Bittensor's first halving. Its next will follow in late 2029, according to current projections.

CME Group has launched Spot-Quoted futures for XRP$1.9053 and Solana SOL$132.23, expanding its lineup of crypto derivatives designed to trade closer to real-time market prices.

The new contracts mirror the structure of CME's existing Spot-Quoted Bitcoin BTC$86,521.67 and Ether ETH$2,958.27 futures. Unlike traditional futures, which often trade at a premium or discount due to financing costs, Spot-Quoted contracts track the spot price directly. Financing adjustments are handled separately at settlement.

""We've seen strong demand for our current Spot-Quoted Bitcoin and Ether futures, with more than 1.3 million contracts traded since launched in June, and we are pleased to add XRP and SOL to our offering,” CME Group's Global Head of Cryptocurrency Products Giovanni Vicioso said in a press release.

These are CME's smallest crypto contracts to date, aimed at active participants who prefer to trade in spot market terms without managing contract expiries or rollovers, Vicioso added.

Since launching in June, Spot-Quoted bitcoin and ether contracts have gained momentum, with more than 1.3 million contracts traded and an average daily volume of 11,300 contracts, with a record 60,700 contracts traded on Nov. 24.

The contracts are listed on CME and CBOT and are available alongside major equity index futures.

Concurrently, CME has activated Trading at Settlement (TAS) for XRP, SOL and their respective Micro futures. This feature lets traders execute futures contracts at a spread to the 4:00 p.m. ET settlement price, before that price is known.

TAS is often used to manage risk around crypto ETFs, especially during net asset value (NAV) creation or redemption. It also allows for block trades and anonymous order book activity via CME Globex, providing flexibility in how and when traders execute.

The move comes after the CME Group started letting its users trade options on SOL, Micro SOL, XRP and Micro XRP futures across daily, monthly, and quarterly expiries back in October.

Jackpot.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A ceramic pot turned into a jackpot for a woman on a walk in the Kutnohorsk Region of the Czech Republic. While out on a stroll, the woman happened upon a roughly 900-year-old stash of more than 2,150 medieval silver coins known as denarii.

While the ceramic pot holding the coins was mostly demolished, the coins themselves remain a rich collection. According to a translated statement, they are now being processed by experts from the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, and the Czech Silver Museum in Kutná Hora.

Dubbed one of the greatest finds of the last decade, institute archaeologist Filip Velímský believes the discovery is like winning a prize in the lottery—even if someone else was the loser. “It was probably placed in its place during the first quarter of the 12th century, at a time of internal political instability,” he said. “At that time, there were disputes in the country between the members of the Přemysl dynasty about the princely throne of Prague.”

Stashing coins in a ceramic container was meant to be a way of keeping them safe. And the container certainly did it's job, even if the owner was never able to return for them—the coins weren't recovered for another 900 years. 

According to the experts, that owner couldn't have been just anyone.“Unfortunately, for the turn of the 11th and 12th centuries, we lack data on the purchasing power of the contemporary coin,” Velímský said. “But it was a huge amount, unimaginable for an ordinary person and at the same time unaffordable. It can be compared to winning a million in the jackpot.” 

The Kutnohorsk Region was known for frequent battles for the Prague princely throne, with the armies of individual rival princes repeatedly marching through the area, according to the institute. The experts claim that a large collection of coins found in such a place could mean that they were originally meant to pay wages for soldiers, or were some sort of “war booty.” 

Early analysis of the haul shows both that the coins were minted in several places throughout the Kutnohorsk Region, and that they were likely created under the rule of three different Přemysl leaders (likely between 1085 and 1107): King Vratislav II and princes Břetislav II and Bořivoje II. 

“The coins were most likely minted in the Prague mint from silver that was imported to Bohemia at the time,” Lenka Mazačová, director of the Czech Silver Museum in Kutná Hora, said in a statement. The coins are made from an silver alloy that included copper, lead, and trace amounts of other metals. The experts hope to figure out the exact composition of the coins to help determine the origin of the silver. 

While we may never know the true intentions—or provenance—of the coin collection, experts still plan to puzzle out as much as possible. Mazačová said that museum staff will now register all the pieces of the collection, clean and restore the coins, and subject them to X-ray imaging and spectral analysis to determine their specific material composition. The goal is to publicly display the collection in 2025, highlighting the 12th century history of the Czech Republic.

Washington state is part of a newly filed lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the legality of a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas that allow highly-skilled individuals to work temporarily in the U.S. 

Attorneys general from 20 states claim the U.S. Department of Homeland Security set the fee at an arbitrary amount that does not reflect the agency's costs, and that the fee was enacted without going through a required notice-and-comment process. 

The visa is meant to recruit employees from abroad who have specialized expertise not found in sufficient numbers in the U.S. workforce.  

Seattle-based Amazon has roughly 19,100 employees working under H-1B visas nationwide. Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., nationally employs more than 6,200 H-1B visa holders. Washington's public universities and agencies have nearly 500 H-1B visa holders on their payrolls, according to federal data and state analysis.

Employers are responsible for paying H-1B fees, which used to run between $960 and $7,595, said Washington State Attorney General Nick Brown's office. Raising the fees, the state warned, will result in empty university labs and science discoveries “will be made somewhere else.”

“These institutions will lose their competitive edge, particularly in the areas of artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and medical fields,” said a press release from Brown's office. 

In announcing the increased fee in September, the Trump administration said the visa was being abused by employers to supplant Americans with “lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.”

“The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security,” said a White House memo addressing restrictions of nonimmigrant workers.

Priyanka Kulkarni, CEO of the immigration tech startup Casium, said the H1-B workers are not low paid, noting that the median salary for the visa holders was about $120,000 last year. 

“Engineers, scientists, healthcare specialists, and educators recruited from abroad often fill critical gaps that enable companies and institutions to grow, invest, and create jobs locally,” she added via email.

The Trump administration has specifically called out high-tech companies' use of the program, saying they “have prominently manipulated the H-1B system, significantly harming American workers in computer-related fields.”

Xiao Wang, CEO of the startup Boundless Immigration, noted that while tech giants are targeted for criticism, the visa also allows for doctors, nurses and researchers to work in the U.S. — echoing some of the concerns raised by Washington's attorney general.

“Adding a $100K fee for all foreign talent trying to enter Washington to work in these fields would all but eliminate this pathway for anyone outside of the most valuable companies in the world and would leave the state with a significant shortage of important roles,” Wang said by email. 

He added that putting a nurse and an AI engineer in the same visa category highlights an overdue need for immigration reform. 

Wang called on Americans to demand that Congress “pass new immigration regulations to stay competitive as a country.”

Amazon filed a new notice with Washington state Monday morning signaling that it's cutting 84 jobs, but the individual separations are part of the regular course of business, unrelated to the 14,000 corporate layoffs it announced globally in October.

The company said each of its businesses regularly reviews its organizational structure and may make adjustments as a result. It's a routine process, the company said, not tied to broader workforce actions.

The notice stems from a new state law that requires employers to disclose all terminations occurring within 90 days of a prior notice under the state's new “mini” version of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, known as the WARN Act.

“We've informed a relatively small number of employees that their roles will be eliminated as the result of individual business decisions,” said Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser. “We don't make decisions like this lightly,” he added, noting that the company is providing affected employees with 90 days of full pay and benefits, transitional health coverage, and job placement services.

According to the filing, the separations are scheduled to occur between Feb. 2 and Feb. 23, 2026, across more than 30 Seattle and Bellevue office locations, plus six remote workers based in Washington. They include software development engineers, program managers, recruiters, HR specialists, and UX designers, ranging from entry-level to directors and principals.

Amazon noted in the filing that employees were notified starting in early November and received at least 89 days' advance notice, exceeding the 60-day minimum required under the law. Those who find internal transfers before their separation date won't be laid off.

Separately, the company said in October that it was cutting 14,000 corporate jobs globally as part of CEO Andy Jassy's push to reduce bureaucracy and operate more efficiently. That earlier round included more than 2,300 layoffs in Washington state, according to a filing at the time.

Amazon HR chief Beth Galetti signaled additional cuts could continue into 2026. Reuters has reported the total could ultimately reach 30,000 — which would surpass the 27,000 positions eliminated in 2023 and mark the largest overall layoff in company history.

Just about six months after Tesla started testing its fledgling Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, the company is now letting those cars drive around the city with no safety monitor onboard.

The removal of the human safety monitors brings the company a critical step closer to its goal of launching a real commercial Robotaxi service, and it's a step that's been years in the making. 

CEO Elon Musk spent nearly a decade promising Tesla's cars were just a software update away from being fully driverless. Now he is on the precipice of launching a service meant to compete with Waymo, the Alphabet-owned company that he said last week “never really had a chance against Tesla.”

The removal of the safety monitors will most likely ramp up the scrutiny on Tesla's ongoing testing in Austin, doubly so when the company starts offering rides in the empty cars. Tesla's small test fleet has been involved in at least seven crashes since June; few details are known about the accidents since the company aggressively redacts its reports to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Video of a totally empty Tesla Model Y SUV started spreading on social media over the weekend, and on Sunday, Musk confirmed his company was testing “with no occupants.” Neither Musk nor Tesla has shared how quickly it plans to move to offer customer rides with no safety monitor. The company's own X account provided a hint in a post Sunday evening: “Slowly, then all at once.” Tesla's head of AI, Ashok Elluswamy, wrote: “And so it begins!”

Tesla started offering rides in Austin to hand-picked influencers and customers in June, with an employee in the passenger seat who could take over if the cars did anything unsafe. Those safety monitors moved to the driver's seat in September. The company has since ditched the wait list, and gradually expanded its service area to cover a large portion of the greater Austin metropolitan area. But its fleet size never grew to more than about 25 to 30 cars by most fans' counts.

Musk has claimed Tesla will operate its own fleet of Robotaxis, and said in July he believed this fleet would cover “half of the population of the U.S.” by the end of this year. That outrageous target, like so many Musk has set over the years, has been revised down to him claiming in November that Tesla would roughly double its existing Austin fleet, or around 60 vehicles.

Tesla has been testing a ride-hail service in the San Francisco area for the last few months, in which drivers use the company's advanced driver assistance software. California has regulations in place that mean Tesla will need to combine multiple permits if it wants to offer fully driverless rides in the state. Texas, on the other hand, does not.

Musk has also talked a lot over the years about allowing Tesla owners to add their personal cars to the company's robotaxi fleet. In 2016, he even promised that every car Tesla made had all the hardware required to eventually become autonomous. That was wrong, and that blog post has since been removed from Tesla's website (the company faces a number of legal challenges over it). Tesla has gone through multiple versions of the hardware that powers its driver assistance software, meaning there are millions of cars on the road that, by Musk's own admission in January, will need to be upgraded.

Fusion power has the potential to rewrite trillion-dollar energy markets, but first, startups have to prove their designs will work and won't be too costly. Neither is easy, especially when considering the massive magnets and lasers used in many designs must be installed with millimeter precision or better.

Fusion startup Thea Energy says its pixel-inspired reactor and specialized control software should be able to generate power without requiring the same level of perfection.

“It doesn't have to be as good to begin with,” Brian Berzin, co-founder and CEO of Thea Energy, told TechCrunch. “We have a way to tune out imperfections on the back end.” That margin of error could give Thea a leg up on the competition. 

Fusion power plants promise to deliver gigawatts of clean power to the grid, but material and construction costs threaten to make them uncompetitive with cheap solar and wind. By building a power plant first and ironing out the kinks in software, Thea could help bring the cost of fusion power down dramatically.

But first the company has to build a working prototype. Today, Thea is publishing the details of its design, including the details of the physics that underpin it. The startup shared the paper exclusively with TechCrunch.

Thea is building a unique take on the stellarator, a specific type of reactor that uses magnets to whip the plasma fuel into shape. Magnets are one of the two main ways that fusion scientists keep plasma heat and confine plasma until fusion reactions occur. The other, known as inertial confinement, uses lasers or some other force to squeeze small fuel pellets.

Most stellarators are built with magnets that look at home in a Salvador Dali painting. But Thea's design uses a dozen larger magnets and hundreds of smaller ones to create what you might call a “virtual” stellarator.

In a typical stellarator, the magnets are built to follow the contours of a shape that's intended to work with the quirks of plasma, helping to confine it for longer using less power than tokamaks, which use a series of identically sized and shaped magnets. Yet stellarators have one major disadvantage: the irregular shape makes mass manufacturing magnets challenging.

So instead, Thea designed its reactor around small, identical superconducting magnets that are arranged in arrays. The startup will use software to control each magnet individually to generate magnetic fields that can replicate a stellarator's wobbly shape.

The approach has several upsides. For one, it has allowed Thea to rapidly iterate on its magnet design. In the last two years, the company has tweaked the design more than 60 times, Berzin said. “Most fusion companies, you're dealing with magnets that are the size of a car or a laser the size of a car or a widget the size of car. That unfortunately means one is $20 million and takes two years [to make],” he said.

It has also meant the company can use software controls to overcome any irregularities in the way the magnets were made or installed. To test its original control system, Thea built a three-by-three array of its magnets laced with sensors. The controls, which were derived from the physics of electromagnetism, worked well. But the company also wanted to see how AI might handle the task, so it also trained a new one using reinforced learning.

The team came away surprised at how well it all worked.

“We purposefully threw curveballs at the array,” Berzin said. “We purposefully dismounted a magnet by literally over a centimeter. You could see it was super out of line. It was really hard for us to actually manufacture it so poorly.” The team also tested superconducting material from five different manufacturers along with intentionally defective material. “Every single time we did that, the control system, without us turning knobs and intervening, was able to tune out those defects,” he said.

Thea's reactor design, Helios, will use two types of magnets. On the outside, 12 large magnets of four different shapes will do the heavy lifting to keep the plasma confined. They're similar to those found on a tokamak, the type of doughnut-shaped reactor that competitor Commonwealth Fusion Systems is building. Inside the large coils, 324 smaller circular magnets will fine-tune the shape of the plasma.

The startup predicts Helios will generate 1.1 gigawatts of heat, which a steam turbine will turn into 390 megawatts of electricity at a cost below $150 per megawatt-hour. The reactor will have to shut down for an 84-day maintenance period once every two years. If all goes well, that means its capacity factor — a measure of how much power it generates over a given period of time — will be 88%. That's far better than today's gas-fired power plants and almost as good as today's nuclear power plants.

Helios is still in the conceptual phase. Thea first has to build Eos, its initial fusion device that's intended to prove the science behind the concept. Berzin said the company will announce a site for Eos in 2026 with plans to turn it on “around 2030.” 

As it builds Eos, Thea plans to start work in parallel on Helios. It's a similar approach to how Commonwealth Fusion Systems is moving forward with work on Arc, its first commercial power plant, while building Sparc, its demonstration plant.

For now, Berzin is looking forward to hearing what the fusion community thinks. “This is the release of the overview paper. This will be followed up by quite a substantial amount of work that will come out via peer review and publication,” he said. “Now is the moment for us to go and set up the partnerships, collaborations, get the end users engaged to go build the first one.”

P.S. In the hopes of making this more than just a sarcastic comment, the question of ""How do people bootstrap knowledge?"" is kind of interesting. [1]> To tackle a hard problem, it is often wise to reuse and recombine existing knowledge. Such an ability to bootstrap enables us to grow rich mental concepts despite limited cognitive resources. Here we present a computational model of conceptual bootstrapping. This model uses a dynamic conceptual repertoire that can cache and later reuse elements of earlier insights in principled ways, modelling learning as a series of compositional generalizations. This model predicts systematically different learned concepts when the same evidence is processed in different orders, without any extra assumptions about previous beliefs or background knowledge. Across four behavioural experiments (total n = 570), we demonstrate strong curriculum-order and conceptual garden-pathing effects that closely resemble our model predictions and differ from those of alternative accounts. Taken together, this work offers a computational account of how past experiences shape future conceptual discoveries and showcases the importance of curriculum design in human inductive concept inferences.[1]: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01719-1

Looking at the README, is the idea that the certificates get generated on the DNS server itself? Not by the ACME client on each machine that needs a certificate?

Or is the idea that you'd have a single server which acts as both the DNS server and the web server?

The (presumably) unintended, unexpected purpose of the logs is to provide public notification of a website coming online for scrapers, search engines, and script kiddies to attack it: I could register https://verylongrandomdomainnameyoucantguess7184058382940052... and unwisely expect it to be unguessable, but as it turns out OpenAI is going to scrape it seconds after the certificate is issued.

The whole purpose of this data is to be consumed by 3rd-parties.

But what GP probably meant is that OAI definitely uses this log to get a list of new websites in order to scrap then later. This is a pretty standard way to use CT logs - you get a list of domains to scrap  instead of relying solely on hyperlinks.

I think it's good to engage this way, but I have a lot of thoughts on things to do that are more effective than giving public comment, and a caution that if you have strong opinions about ALPRs and you choose to pay attention to this issue you're going to be confronted with a lot of opinions that may surprise/discomfit you.

Shorter and more compact, but at the cost of fewer features

As observed by hardware enthusiast Uniko's Hardware, Asus and Gigabyte have launched new versions of their GeForce RTX 5060 Ti models, which are among the best graphics cards currently available. In the case of Asus, the new Evo-branded SKU is more compact but also involves several noticeable downgrades. Conversely, in Gigabyte's case, the update appears to be solely an aesthetic modification.

The primary, and arguably most significant, modification in Asus and Gigabyte's updated models pertains to the PCIe connector. Asus has transitioned to a PCIe x8 connector on the Dual GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Evo 16GB GDDR7, replacing the PCIe x16 connector present in the original Dual GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB GDDR7. Conversely, Gigabyte has implemented the opposite adjustment by adopting a PCIe x16 connector on the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti WindForce Max 16G in place of the PCIe x8 connector used in the previous GeForce RTX 5060 Ti WindForce 16G.

The GeForce RTX 5060 and GeForce RTX 5060 Ti operate efficiently with a PCIe x8 connector, as Nvidia has engineered these graphics cards to function optimally on this interface. Although a PCIe x16 connector can be installed on either of these mid-range, Blackwell-powered models, they are electrically configured to operate at x8. Therefore, the performance is unaffected whether the graphics card uses a PCIe x16 or x8 connector.

The primary rationale for downgrading from a PCIe x16 to a PCIe x8 connector is cost reduction, as the former is more expensive due to its larger size and additional data lanes. While this may apply to Asus, it is also possible that Gigabyte recycles surplus PCBs for this purpose.

The PCIe x8 connector isn't the only change to the Dual GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Evo 16GB GDDR7. The new model is also more compact, as Asus has reduced the design from 2.5 slots to 2.1 slots and shortened the graphics card by around 2%. The goal was to make the Dual GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Evo 16GB GDDR7 more friendly to SFF (small-form-factor) systems. Sadly, this modification reduced some features compared to the original model.

The Dual GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Evo 16GB GDDR7 no longer supports dual-BIOS functionality. The original version included a switch that enabled users to toggle between P Mode and Q Mode, allowing them to choose between enhanced performance and reduced noise levels. This feature is absent in the Evo edition. Furthermore, it does not utilize Asus GPU Guard, which involves applying adhesive to the four corners of the GB206 silicon to prevent potential cracking. Another minor modification is relocating the 8-pin PCIe connector to the left side of the Dual GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Evo 16GB GDDR7.

Meanwhile, the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti WindForce Max 16G is physically indistinguishable from the previous GeForce RTX 5060 Ti WindForce 16G, except for the positioning of the 8-pin PCIe power connector. In the Max variant, it is situated on the right side, resembling the placement on the Asus non-Evo model.

 December 15, 2025  

A 32-year-old woman of African descent presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of fatigue, yellowish skin discolouration, and passing dark-coloured urine.

Initially, treating physicians suspected methaemoglobinaemia and treated it according to the guidelines. However, the patient's condition worsened, and re-evaluation of her symptoms led to the correct diagnosis of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.

The patient's medical history includes gestational hypertension and Mounjaro (tirzepatide, a GLP-1 receptor analogue) use for weight loss. There was no family history of medical conditions. She consumed beef jerky 2 days before the onset of symptoms.

She was pale and icteric, with an otherwise normal systemic examination. Pulse oximetry showed peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 86%, but arterial blood gas showed partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 11.4 kPa (≈85 mm Hg). With supplemental oxygen (15 L) via a non-rebreather mask, SpO2 improved to 88%.

Laboratory investigations included a complete blood cell count, liver and renal function tests, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyl transaminase, methaemoglobin level, and a direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test. Initial blood work demonstrated findings consistent with haemolysis along with elevated methaemoglobin; the Coombs test was negative. Initial laboratory tests yielded: haemoglobin of 70 g/L (normal range, 115-155 g/L), a reticulocyte count of 4% (normal range, 0.2%-2.0%), total bilirubin of 197 μmol/L (normal range, 1-21 μmol/L), lactate dehydrogenase of 476 IU/L (normal range, < 250 IU/L), methaemoglobin of 7.0% (normal range, < 1.2%), and G6PD activity of 3.0 U/g Hb (normal range, 5.0-12.1 U/g Hb); the peripheral blood smear showed blister cells and spherocytes.

In view of the elevated methaemoglobin level, she received methylene blue (1-2 mg/kg). Shortly thereafter, her haemolysis worsened. This prompted haematologic evaluation, and confirmatory G6PD testing revealed severe enzyme deficiency.

Methylene blue was discontinued, and the patient was managed with two units of packed red blood cells (RBCs), ascorbic acid, and folic acid. The patient was discharged on day 6, with advice to avoid oxidative drugs and dietary triggers.

G6PD is an essential erythrocyte enzyme involved in the hexose monophosphate pathway that reduces reactive oxidative stress on the RBC membrane. Unless exposed to oxidative stress, such as infection, drugs, or fava bean ingestion, most individuals remain asymptomatic due to increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) consumption, heightening cellular oxidative stress.

The patient was initially misdiagnosed with methaemoglobinaemia due to an absent family history, young female sex, and discordant low SpO2 with normal arterial pO2, suggesting primary methaemoglobinaemia treatable with methylene blue. Worsening haemolysis after methylene blue redirected the diagnosis to underlying G6PD deficiency.

G6PD deficiency is the most common form of red cell enzymopathy worldwide. Although X-linked, clinically significant haemolysis can occur in women when X chromosome inactivation is skewed. Bias towards the mutant allele leaves the circulating red cell pool deficient, and oxidative stress can outstrip available NADPH, leading to haemolysis. Genetic testing confirms the diagnosis but has no therapeutic implications.

The trigger for this was the consumption of beef jerky. Processed meats often contain nitrates that the intestinal flora can reduce to nitrites, which are implicated in foodborne methaemoglobinaemia and haemolysis in susceptible individuals. Avoiding oxidative triggers remains central to discharge counselling.

This case of haemolysis and methaemoglobinaemia in a person with previously undiagnosed G6PD deficiency underscores the need to consider alternatives to the most apparent diagnoses, to recognise that women can also be affected, and to appreciate that triggers extend beyond fava beans.

Among individuals with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis, those who underwent partial knee replacement demonstrated clinical outcomes and rates of reoperation and revision comparable to those who underwent total knee replacement over 10 years, while offering greater cost-effectiveness.

“This 10-year randomized controlled trial data provides the strongest, most robust evidence yet about the relative merits of [total knee replacement] and [partial knee replacement]. There were no significant differences between implants in clinical outcomes, reoperations, or revisions. However, the lower complication rate and the dominant health economic findings support continued recommendation for [partial knee replacement],” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by David J. Beard, DPhil, University of Oxford, Oxford, England. It was published online on November 18, 2025, in The Lancet Rheumatology.

The selective nature of the trial may limit the generalizability of the results. Younger, high-demand patients who could benefit more from partial knee replacement may have been excluded. The long duration of the study also raises concerns because there may have been improvements in the devices and techniques over time.

The study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme. Four authors disclosed receiving research grants or investigator awards or being members of the NIHR. Two authors declared receiving grants, consulting fees, or royalties from Zimmer Biomet, and another author reported serving as a board member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and the University of Bristol, Bristol, England, and holding a patent.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hello, everybody, and welcome back to Medscape to talk about the news during the ESMO Congress of that took place in Berlin [October 17-21]. We had some discussions about the new treatment options for patients with stage III melanoma at this time point, and I would like to talk to you about a couple of studies that were presented during the congress that pertain to the neoadjuvant setting. 

As you saw in the previous episodes that we discussed together, the patients who have resectable stage III melanoma do have the possibility of receiving neoadjuvant therapy. There were a couple of trials that investigated this therapy as compared to adjuvant therapy. These trials were presented at the time of the congress, and this is what I'm going to discuss with you today. 

For the second abstract, we'll discuss with you the data from the NADINA trial, which was also an academic study that looked into neoadjuvant ipilimumab/nivolumab vs adjuvant PD-1 monotherapy alone in patients who had unresectable stage III melanoma. The authors showed a 2-year clinical update and the first biomarker analysis. 

In terms of the study design, we already talked about this study in previous discussions on this forum. Basically, for those who are less familiar with this, the trial randomized patients with macroscopic disease to receive either upfront therapeutic lymph node dissection followed by the traditional adjuvant immunotherapy, or to cycles of ipilimumab/nivolumab followed by the therapeutic lymph node dissection, and then adjuvant therapy based on the pathologic response. 

If the patients had a major pathologic response, they would go on in follow-up. If they had a partial pathologic response or no pathologic response, they would undergo adjuvant therapy based on BRAF status. The primary endpoint was event-free survival. 

The event-free survival update, with a median follow-up of 25 months at this time point, continues to show a benefit of the neoadjuvant approach compared to the adjuvant therapy alone, with a difference that goes around 22%.

In terms of the distant metastasis-free survival, the difference was also significant, and it was also favoring the neoadjuvant approach, with 82.8% in the neoadjuvant therapy arm and 63.9% in the adjuvant therapy arm. 

In terms of safety data, there were no significant updates based on what was already known at the time. The authors also looked into the pathologic response in the neoadjuvant arm, and looked into relapse-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival based on pathologic response. 

Interestingly enough, we see that the patients who have a pathologic complete response do extremely well after this follow-up, with a relapse-free survival of 95% and distant metastasis-free survival of 98%. The patients who did not have a pathologic response do, I'll say, less well, with less than half of the percentage of recurrence-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival as compared to the pathologic complete response at this time point.

Then we have two groups in between that are the patients with near pathologic complete response and patients with pathologic partial response. Here, there is kind of an overlap. The authors also did an analysis in terms of pathologic response in the neoadjuvant arm, and looked into relapse-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival.

Here, we see that the patients who had a pathologic complete response do extremely well. The patients who didn't have a pathologic complete response do much worse. Then we have, as an intermediate group, the patients with near pathologic complete response or pathologic partial response where the curves are crossing, showing that it is not clear whether the patients who had a near pathologic complete response had the need for further adjuvant therapy as did the patients who had partial pathological response.

Moving on to the outcomes of the patients who went on to receive adjuvant therapy because they did not benefit from the neoadjuvant therapy, and had pathologic partial response or no pathologic response. We had a group of 10 patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy, then 21 received adjuvant nivolumab and 43 received adjuvant dabrafenib/trametinib.

We see that, among the patients who received nivolumab, the benefit is very modest. It seems that if they don't benefit from the neoadjuvant therapy, the chances of receiving adjuvant therapy with PD-1 afterward are low. Then we have the patients who received targeted therapy who do better, almost to 30% better after 2 years — meaning that, although the numbers are small, it might be legitimate to change for targeted therapy if the patients did not benefit from neoadjuvant therapy and they have a BRAF mutation. 

In terms of the biomarkers that were analyzed, the authors looked into tumor mutational burden (TMB), interferon gamma signature, and PD-L1 expression. Here, we can see that the patients who have TMB high, or have an interferon gamma signature high, or have PD-L1 expression that's more than 1%, do much better than their counterparts. 

When we look into the event-free survival analysis, both in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant arms, and at the interference gamma signature and the PD-L1 expression, we see that it correlates with event-free survival in both arms. As for TMB, the authors showed that it correlates with the event-free survival in the neoadjuvant arm. 

They went on to do some combinations of the biomarkers, including interferon gamma and TMB or PD-L1 plus TMB, and there are some hints showing that this combination might be able to differentiate subgroups that could be used for further analysis or for further evaluations in potential new studies.

I think, at this time point, we are looking into an evaluation that might not be available for all patients on one hand. The numbers are not that high, but it's a huge effort from this study looking into these biomarkers and doing all these analyses.

We still need to wait and to be cautious about using these biomarkers as they are right now to further refine the therapy, but this is the way to go — definitely.

Older Americans with metastatic breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer are spending an increasing amount of time in the healthcare system, driven mainly by treatments, tests, and clinician visits. The number of healthcare contact days rose between 2008 and 2019, with a notable jump in the ambulatory visits from 2016 onward.

“Increasing contact days observed during the study period should prompt oncology care teams to recognize the time burden associated with metastatic cancer care and consider expected healthcare contact days when discussing care goals and choosing treatment plans with patients,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study “acknowledges an often underappreciated burden — the substantial time our patients commit to cancer care,” wrote Sahil D. Doshi, MD, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, and colleagues in an accompanying editorial. “These findings highlight the unmet need to address time toxicity and lay the foundation for innovative care delivery models to increase time at home.”

The study, led by Arjun Gupta, MD, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, was published online in JAMA Network Open.

The analysis focused exclusively on Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with incident metastatic cancer, potentially limiting generalizability to patients younger than 66 years, those with other insurance types, and those with earlier-stage or recurrent cancer. Additionally, the study did not assess the appropriateness, quality, or efficiency of healthcare contact days.

The study received support through grant 23-20-GUPT from the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. Some authors reported receiving grants from various sources. One author reported being a member of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. Full disclosures are noted in the original article.

A two-year study from Thailand reveals how often long COVID follows hospitalization, how long symptoms can persist, and why vaccination and disease severity make a critical difference to patients' long-term quality of life.

Study: Prevalence and impact of long COVID on health-related quality of life in previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a 2-year follow-up study. Image credit: MW Shutter/Shutterstock.com

A new study published in Scientific Reports finds a high prevalence of long-COVID among patients in Thailand who had been hospitalized due to symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2021.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has placed a significant burden on the global healthcare system since its emergence in 2019. The threat is continuing even in 2025, with a significant proportion of previously infected individuals still experiencing persisting symptoms of COVID-19, a condition medically termed as long-COVID.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines long-COVID as the continuation or development of new symptoms three months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with these symptoms lasting for at least two months with no other explanation.        

The global prevalence of long-COVID has been estimated to be approximately 36 % to 43 %, with higher prevalence observed among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Studies investigating long-COVID risk factors have identified female gender and acute COVID-19 severity as major predictors and COVID-19 vaccination as a major protector.

Studies analyzing the prevalence, predictors, and outcomes of long COVID have mostly been conducted in high-income countries. In low- and middle-income countries, especially in Southeast Asia, evidence is limited. The reported prevalence of long-COVID in Southeast Asia ranges from 3.4 % to 47 %. However, most of the studies lack long-term follow-up.

Given this gap in the literature, researchers at Mahidol University conducted a study in Thailand to determine the prevalence and predictors of long COVID-19 among hospitalized patients.

The study population included a total of 295 adult patients who were admitted to medical wards and intensive care units for symptomatic COVID-19 between August and November 2021.

The patients were followed up through telephonic interviews at three months, one year, and two years post-infection. During the interviews, patients were asked about long-COVID symptoms and whether these symptoms affected their daily living.

Patients' demographic characteristics, such as gender, age at infection, body mass index, comorbidities, and vaccination status, as well as clinical information during hospitalization, including disease severity, were analyzed to identify predictors of long COVID.

The study's estimations revealed that the prevalence of long-COVID among hospitalized patients was 49.8 % three months after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most common symptoms were breathlessness, hair loss, fatigue, muscle pain, and chest pain.

The symptoms of long COVID persisted for one year among 64 % of patients who reported long COVID at three months, and for two years among 22 % of patients who remained symptomatic at one year, highlighting the conditional nature of long-term persistence. Notably, the study found an increasing prevalence of neurocognitive symptoms at one year post-infection. The five most reported persistent symptoms were breathlessness, memory disturbance, fatigue, cough, and peripheral numbness.  

The analysis of predictors and protective factors revealed that patients with severe to critical acute COVID-19 have a significantly higher risk of developing long-COVID. However, patients who have received a complete two-dose vaccination before the onset of COVID-19 have a significantly lower risk of developing long-COVID.

The study reports a high prevalence of long-COVID among previously hospitalized patients in Thailand, with symptoms persisting in a substantial proportion of affected individuals over a period of two years. These findings are concerning as persisting symptoms of long-COVID have been found to affect the daily living of affected individuals.

Among reported symptoms, joint pain has shown a significant association with perceived impact on daily living. Other reported symptoms that frequently impact participants' daily living include fatigue, sleep disturbances, decreased appetite, and muscle pain.  

According to the findings, having a severe to critical case of acute COVID-19 is a major risk factor for long-COVID, while complete vaccination protects against the condition. These two factors are also significant predictors of the perceived impact of long-COVID on daily living.

By analyzing demographic characteristics of participants who reported impaired daily living, the study finds that men are less likely to develop long-COVID with an impact on daily living than women. The differences in inflammatory profiles and airway morphology between genders may contribute to the higher risk of long-COVID among females.

Overall, the study's findings provide an overview of the long-term effects of COVID-19 among hospitalized Thai individuals, bridging a gap in the literature for low- and middle-income countries.

The study had a small sample size and a high loss-to-follow-up rate, which may limit the accuracy of prevalence estimates. The exclusive inclusion of hospitalized Thai patients may limit the generalizability of the findings to non-hospitalized patients and other nationals.

The study was conducted during the Delta variant outbreak, and the prevalence and impact of long COVID may differ from other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Moreover, the protective effect of vaccination against long-COVID symptoms may be underestimated in the study due to the lack of data on the timing between vaccination and the onset of infection.

The study lacks data on repeated COVID-19 infections and, therefore, could not reveal the impact of reinfection on long-COVID epidemiology. The absence of a comparator group of people without COVID-19 limits the affirmation that the reported symptoms are solely the sequelae of COVID-19.

Larger-scale, multicenter studies with appropriate comparator groups are needed to more accurately estimate the prevalence and more conclusively understand the health outcomes associated with long-COVID.

The Africa Cup of Nations 2025 will take place in Morocco from 21 December 2025 to 18 January 2026. Find out the fixture schedule, key dates and relevant information about the men's football tournament.

Twenty-four men's national football teams from Africa will play in the 2025 CAF Africa Cup of Nations, which is due to be held in Morocco from 21 December 2025 to 18 January 2026.

Originally scheduled for June–July 2025, the tournament was pushed to the end of the year after FIFA introduced its expanded 32-team Club World Cup for that same summer.

This shift means the competition will, for the first time, take place across the Christmas and New Year period. It also marks Morocco's second time hosting the event, having last staged it in 1988.

The 35th edition of the biennial tournament will be held across nine venues in six cities, the most ever for an AFCON, four of which are located in the country's capital, Rabat.

With seven of Africa's nine confirmed 2026 FIFA World Cup teams participating at this year's AFCON, the tournament will also serve as a crucial testing ground ahead of next summer's showpiece in the USA, Canada, and Mexico.

In many ways, it will also serve as a test event for Morocco, which is set to co-host the FIFA World Cup 2030 alongside Portugal and Spain.

Discover what you need to know about AFCON 2025 below.

The official mascot for AFCON 2025 in Morocco is Assad, a lively young lion inspired by the historic Atlas lion. His name, which means 'lion' in Arabic, reflects strength, pride and leadership, qualities closely linked to both Moroccan heritage and African football. Designed to be energetic and friendly, Assad represents unity, passion and the youthful spirit of the tournament, serving as a symbol to connect fans across the continent and beyond.

Another distinctive feature of the Africa Cup of Nations is its official song, which often blends sounds from across the continent to create a unifying anthem that resonates with fans both within and beyond Africa. While the official song for AFCON 2025 is expected to be released this week ahead of kick-off, if previous editions are anything to go by, another classic is on the way.

All eyes will be on host nation Morocco, whose squad is widely regarded as a golden generation and will be desperate to secure an AFCON title to cement that legacy.

The North Africans have not won the tournament since 1976.

After making history as the first African team to reach the semi-finals of a FIFA World Cup in 2022, Morocco suffered a shock Round of 16 exit at the last AFCON tournament in Côte d'Ivoire, despite being considered favourites.

They quickly put that disappointment behind them by becoming the first African side to qualify for the FIFA World Cup 2026.

Head coach Walid Regragui will be hoping to have team captain and Paris 2024 Olympic bronze medallist Achraf Hakimi, the reigning African Footballer of the Year, fit for the tournament. The Paris St. Germain defender picked up an ankle injury in November and now faces a race against time to be ready for the competition.

Another team carrying significant pressure into the tournament is Nigeria. The three-time champions came agonisingly close in Côte d'Ivoire, falling to the host nation in the final. But a disappointing World Cup qualifying campaign, where they failed to reach back-to-back tournaments, means only lifting the trophy in Morocco will feel like proper compensation.

Captain William Troost-Ekong, the Player of the Tournament at the last AFCON, announced his retirement from international football just weeks before this edition, passing the leadership baton to Galatasaray star Victor Osimhen and Atalanta forward Ademola Lookman, winners of the African Footballer of the Year awards in 2023 and 2024 respectively.

AFCON 2021 (played in 2022) champions Senegal find themselves in Group D, alongside the Democratic Republic of Congo, who are just one intercontinental play-off against New Caledonia away from qualifying for their first FIFA World Cup in 51 years.

Familiar names such as London 2012 Olympian Sadio Mané, Kalidou Koulibaly, Nicolas Jackson and Idrissa Gana Gueye were instrumental in securing Senegal's place at the 2026 World Cup, where they kept eight clean sheets in ten qualifying matches. They will be hoping that the same defensive solidity can carry them all the way in Morocco.

Defending champions Cote d'Ivoire are another team to watch. They took an unlikely route to glory on home soil last January, sacking their head coach after losing their first two group games. A vital win in the final group match, overseen by assistant coach Emerse Faé, secured a third-place finish and a place in the knockouts, where they went on a fairytale run to claim their second continental title.

Faé has since been appointed on a permanent basis and guided the team through a flawless World Cup qualifying campaign. Inspired by Manchester United's Amad Diallo, the Elephants are widely tipped to be contenders once again.

Then there is London 2012 Olympian Mohamed Salah and Egypt. The record seven-time champions have not lifted the trophy since 2010, when they completed an unprecedented hat-trick of consecutive AFCON titles. Salah, then an 18-year-old learning his trade at Al-Mokawloon, has since become one of the greatest players of his generation, yet AFCON success continues to elude him. He has reached two finals (2017 and 2021) but lost both, and with Egypt already qualified for the World Cup, AFCON 2025 is widely seen as a last major opportunity for the 33-year-old Liverpool forward to secure the title that would cement his status as the country's greatest-ever footballer.

He will have able support in the likes of Manchester City's Omar Marmoush and Mostafa Mohamed of FC Nantes, who are expected to provide attacking dynamism and depth.

Five-time champions Cameroon also enter the tournament in the spotlight. A turbulent World Cup qualifying campaign in which they failed to reach the finals was followed by even more upheaval. Federation president Samuel Eto'o Fils, the Barcelona legend and Olympic gold medallist from Sydney 2000, replaced Belgian coach Marc Brys with local trainer David Pagou just three weeks before the tournament. Pagou then omitted star goalkeeper André Onana and influential captain Vincent Aboubakar from the squad for Morocco.

Even so, Cameroon are not short of talent. Manchester United forward Bryan Mbeumo is expected to be the focal point of their push for a sixth continental crown.

South Africa, who surprised many by finishing third in Côte d'Ivoire, will believe they can go even further this time. Hugo Broos' side secured World Cup qualification ahead of Nigeria, with the core of the squad made up of locally based players whose cohesion and understanding has become the envy of many national teams.

AFCON 2019 champions Algeria and perennial contenders Tunisia are also expected to mount strong challenges for the most coveted trophy in African football.

The Africa Cup of Nations 2025 tournament will be broadcast across the globe in over 30 countries and regions. Below is the broadcast list in each country/region.

 Ryan Wilson is the Head of Communications at the British High Commission

The Head of Communications at the British High Commission in Ghana, Ryan Wilson, has expressed optimism about the Black Stars' chances of progressing from their group at the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

According to him, England and Ghana are favourites to qualify from the group, based on their recent performances and the quality of players they possess.Ghana to face Germany in pre-World Cup friendly “I genuinely want Ghana and England to progress. I really think Ghana has a chance of doing it because, even though Croatia are ranked higher in the world, I don't think they are quite the team they once were. They have good individuals, but I don't think they are as strong,” he told Graphic Sports.Wilson added that Ghana could secure a decent result against the Three Lions, noting, “Ghana has a strong team. The last time Ghana and England played in 2011, it ended in a draw. I also read a statistic that whenever Ghana play their second group game at the World Cup, they usually win, while England's form tends to be inconsistent. So I think that game could go either way.”The Black Stars face a challenging task on their path to the knockout stage of the 2026 FIFA World Cup following the group-stage draw held on Friday, December 5, 2025.

Ghana has been placed in Group L alongside England, Croatia, and Panama, with all four teams battling for a spot in the knockout phase.Head coach Otto Addo has said that although England are favourites to top the group, he remains confident the Black Stars will advance to the next stage and avoid a group-stage exit.SB/MAGhanaian teaching assistant who survived Brown University mass shooting speaks: TWI NEWS

The last may not have been heard about the Super Eagles qualification for the 2026 World Cup after senior officials expressed confidence that DR Congo will be thrown out of the competition for parading several ineligible players.

“The chances of the petition against DR Congo sailing through is even better than when South Africa were docked three points and three goals for fielding an ineligible player against Lesotho in a qualifier,” a top source told SCORENigeria

“A petition has been fired against DRC in respect of the eligibility of several of their players who featured in the World Cup Playoffs in Morocco.

“There's still hope for the Super Eagles as long as the Intercontinental Playoffs in Mexico has not been played.”

SCORENigeria further learnt that this petition has the full backing of the Federal Government of Nigeria.

In November, DRC qualified for the Intercontinental Playoffs after they beat the Super Eagles on penalties after both teams were tied on 1-1 even after extra time.

The USMNT Transfer Notebook tracks American player movements, with the latest developments for those in the U.S. national team pool.

With the January transfer window just weeks away, several U.S. men's national team players are approaching pivotal decisions at a critical moment in the World Cup cycle. As 2026 draws closer, club futures - and, in some cases, minutes - could play a decisive role in shaping Mauricio Pochettino's plans.

For players on the fringes, the margin is especially thin. Luca de la Torre is one such case. His loan with San Diego FC has ended after the club declined to exercise its purchase option, leaving the midfielder at a crossroads. With his USMNT status far from secure, de la Torre's next move - whether a return to MLS or another opportunity in Europe - could prove decisive.

Elsewhere, Tyler Adams' stock continues to rise in England, where his performances for Bournemouth have placed him among the Premier League's standout defensive midfielders and attracted interest from bigger clubs. Meanwhile, questions persist in Italy, where Christian Pulisic's contract talks with AC Milan have stalled. A USMNT icon weighs in on what may come next for the American star as the window approaches.

GOAL tracks all of the American player movements in the USMNT Transfer Notebook, a recurring feature covering the latest developments for those in the U.S. national team pool.



Pulisic is under contract with AC Milan through June 2027, a timeline that has fueled questions about why the American has yet to agree to an extension with the Rossoneri. One rumor has suggested Pulisic is waiting to see whether Milan will clinch a Champions League place before committing his long-term future to the club.

Former USMNT goalkeeper Brad Friedel can relate. Friedel, who spent his career across Europe with clubs including Galatasaray, Liverpool and Tottenham, believes there are limited reasons a player would delay an extension at this stage.

“I think it suggests that he is leaving his options open. When I was at clubs, I always wanted to sign my contracts when I was happy at places,"" Friedel explained in an interview with GOAL. ""I can only go on personal experience, I liked having multiple years on the contract - you never know with injuries around the corner. If I was truly happy at a place, I really enjoyed having two or three years on a contract.

“There are only two reasons for not signing. One, you are not happy with the contract. Two, you are keeping your options open. Maybe he has given a verbal commitment. I would assume that he is keeping his options open. If you are happy somewhere and you are happy with the numbers, you sign the contract.”

When healthy, Pulisic has been among Serie A's most productive players this season, recording nine goal contributions in nine appearances. He reportedly earns around $6 million annually at Milan and has been linked with interest from Premier League clubs, as well as ongoing speculation about a potential return stateside with MLS.

The rumor began circulating late last week before gathering real momentum over the weekend. Could Tyler Adams truly be headed to Manchester United?

While the Red Devils are no longer the dominant force they once were, they remain one of the most storied and widely followed clubs in world football — and Adams profiles as a natural fit for a side in need of defensive stability. The Bournemouth midfielder ranks in the 86th percentile among midfielders for defensive actions and the 62nd percentile in aerial duels, according to FotMob. Only Chelsea's Moisés Caicedo has recorded more interceptions in the Premier League this season, underlining why United's interest makes sense.

The Daily Mail is reporting United are preparing a jaw-dropping $53.4 million (£40 million) bid on the Bournemouth star, and the Telegraph also wrote a column suggesting why the American would be a better fit than some of the other alternatives linked with the club. Adams spoke of his appreciation of Old Trafford in a recent interview. 

""I played against Manchester United at Old Trafford during COVID with RB Leipzig. That was the first time I walked into Old Trafford, and I was like, my dream is really to play in the Premier League because this is what it's about right here,"" he said. ""Now being able to go back and play there multiple times and have good results, especially makes it a little bit better. So yeah, I always get excited to play against United.""

A move to Old Trafford would be headline-grabbing. Adams would become the first USMNT player to represent Manchester United since Tim Howard's departure in 2007. Still, questions remain about whether January is the right moment. Adams is in the midst of the strongest club campaign of his career, and leaving the stability he has found at Bournemouth for a club with intense scrutiny and lofty expectations carries obvious risk in a World Cup year.

At the same time, opportunities of this magnitude are rare - particularly for American players - ensuring the situation is one worth watching as the window approaches.

If Fiorentina fail in their pursuit of Köln midfielder Eric Martel, Tanner Tessmann could emerge as an alternative, according to Calciomercato. La Viola are seeking reinforcements in midfield, with both Martel and Tessmann reported to be among their leading targets.

The move would be an intriguing one for Tessmann. Despite enjoying the strongest European season of his career, the American could become expendable at Lyon amid the club's well-documented financial concerns. Still, questions remain about the logic of a January switch. Lyon are competing for a Champions League place, while Fiorentina have struggled in Serie A this season and remain entangled in a relegation battle.

Financial considerations may play a role, but the risk is clear. Tessmann has already experienced relegation in Italy during his time at Venezia, a scenario he would be keen to avoid repeating. The midfielder is reportedly valued between $11.7 million and $15.2 million, a figure that could rise should interest from additional clubs materialize. It is worth noting that Fiorentina's interest in Tessmann isn't new. They tried to sign him before he decided on Venezia.

It wouldn't be far-fetched to say De la Torre was San Diego FC's third-best player last season, shining as a midfield engine behind Hirving Lozano and Anders Dreyer. Yet, in a somewhat surprising move, San Diego let their hometown star head back to Celta Vigo - where he was loaned from - while declining a purchase option. While neither the player nor the club has officially ruled out a return, the fact that the club posted a farewell message on social media suggests his future lies elsewhere. De la Torre had five goals and four assists in his first season in MLS.

Now back with Celta, De la Torre can't make an appearance for the La Liga side until January, when the league registration reopens. Yet, he might not return to Spain at all, as MLS clubs are in the mix for the 27-year-old. According to MLS Transfers, the New York Red Bulls are interested in trading American youth international Daniel Edelman, and it could open the door for the club to sign De la Torre from Celta - a player they believe could strengthen their midfield after a disappointing season. With one of the all-time USMNT midfield greats, Michael Bradley, being hired for the position, the New York/New Jersey area could be a strong landing spot for De la Torre.

Inter Miami CF have secured the services of experienced Spanish left back Sergio Reguilón on a long-term contract, the club announced Monday. The 28-year-old defender joins as a free agent after his departure from English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur and will remain with the Herons through December 2027, with a club option that could extend his stay until December 2028.

Reguilón's arrival addresses a significant void in Inter Miami's defensive lineup following the retirement of Spanish legend Jordi Alba, who concluded his illustrious career after helping the club secure the 2025 MLS Cup presented by Audi. The new signing brings considerable European pedigree to South Florida, having competed at the highest levels of club football throughout his career.


""It's a very ambitious project, a winning club that is doing things the right way, and that's what attracted me: coming here to keep winning and competing,"" Reguilón said as per the club's statement. ""My objective is to keep winning, go after the trophies we're missing, and win everything here.""

Reguilón brings extensive experience from Europe's most competitive environments, having accumulated more than 260 professional appearances throughout his career. His resume includes 81 matches in the English Premier League and 56 in Spain's La Liga, along with valuable experience in prestigious continental competitions, including the UEFA Champions League and Europa League.

The defender's journey has taken him through several prominent clubs in both Spain and England. At the international level, Reguilón has earned six caps with the Spanish national team, including appearances in UEFA Nations League matches and FIFA World Cup qualifying.

Known for his pace, overlapping runs, and comfort on the ball, Reguilón profiles as a natural fit in Inter Miami's system, where fullbacks are expected to contribute in both phases. His ability to stretch the field and deliver quality service from wide areas mirrors many of the attributes that made Alba such a vital piece during Miami's title-winning run. Defensively, Reguilón has solid positional awareness, traits that should help Miami balance their attacking ambition with stability at the back.

Coming off their first MLS Cup, Inter Miami's recruitment reflects a club planning beyond a single title window. By securing Reguilón through at least 2027, the club has added a proven, prime-age defender capable of anchoring the left flank as Miami look to defend their crown and remain a force domestically.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Injury-plagued ex-Arsenal man Takehiro Tomiyasu finally set to return to football after finding new club following Gunners exit","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/ex-arsenal-takehiro-tomiyasu-return-football-finding-new-club-gunners-exit/blte5040710fc720adf","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 16:17:36 GMT","

Injury-plagued former Arsenal defender Takehiro Tomiyasu is finally set to return to football after finding a new club following his exit from the Emirates Stadium. The Japan international left the Gunners in July this year after the Premier League giants agreed a contract termination with the full-back, who had struggled with injuries in the last few seasons. 

Tomiyasu left Arsenal after four years, having played just six minutes of football in the 2024-25 season due to knee surgery. At the time of his release, the defender was not expected to return to full fitness for another five months. The club mutually agreed with the 26-year-old to terminate his contract, which was due to expire in 2026.

The official statement from the Gunners had read: ""We have reached a mutual agreement with Takehiro Tomiyasu to end his contract with immediate effect. The 26-year-old defender, who joined us from Bologna in August 2021, made 84 appearances in all competitions during his time with the club. Unfortunately, injuries have limited Tomi's time on the pitch in the past two seasons, with the defender making just one substitute appearance last season. It was therefore mutually agreed to end Tomi's contract in order for him to start a new chapter in his career. Everyone at Arsenal Football Club would like to thank Tomi for his contribution to the club and we wish him and his family all the best for the future.""

According to Fabrizio Romano, Tomiyasu has now verbally agreed to join Dutch giants Ajax on a short-term deal, which will be valid until 2026. The ex-Gunners will undergo a medical on Tuesday at the Eedivisie side and if all goes well for the player, he will put pen to paper in the next few days.

Known as a reliable performer and strong defender, Tomiyasu has not been able to stay consistently fit in the last few years and this had curtailed his time in north London. Tomiyasu, who is used to playing at the right-back position, has featured across the back line for the Gunners. 

But with the emergence of the likes of Jurrien Timber, Riccardo Calafiori and Myles Lewis-Skelly as full-backs since last season, in addition to Tomiyasu's former right-back competitor Ben White still amongst the ranks, Mikel Arteta might have felt that his squad had moved on in Tomiyasu's extended absence. Therefore, the Japanese full-back's departure was always on the cards.

While Arsenal continue to lead the Premier League title race and are two points clear of Manchester City in the table, their performance in recent matches has dipped after starting the 2025-26 season in red-hot form. On Saturday, the Gunners picked up a hard-fought win over rock bottom side Wolves and after the game, Arteta acknowledged the team's shortcomings.

The Spaniard said: ""It was a relief, but we have a very clear understanding that the margins should have been bigger. We generated more chances in the second half, but after that we had a period of two or three minutes in deep, totally passive, with horrible defensive habits that are nowhere near the levels required. The first time they had an opportunity to score, they did. We should have stopped the shots before, and that is on us.""

When speaking to BBC Match of the Day, Arteta summed up the chaotic evening in blunt terms. ""It was a rollercoaster,"" he said. ""The longer the game went on, they had hope and we had to accelerate our game and take more risks. We did find a way and that's a very positive thing, if not we'd be very frustrated and rightly so, but there are things to improve obviously.""

Bayer Leverkusen CEO Fernando Carro has launched a scathing critique of Real Madrid's hierarchy, accusing Florentino Perez of leaving Xabi Alonso ""isolated"" at the Bernabeu. The German club's chief claims the culture in the Spanish capital treats managers as a ""necessary evil"", contrasting it sharply with the support Alonso enjoyed at the BayArena.

Alonso's tenure at Real Madrid, once viewed as the homecoming of a managerial prodigy, has quickly turned into a trial by fire. Back-to-back home defeats to Celta and Manchester City added fuel to reports that Alonso's future at the club is in doubt heading into the weekend clash against Deportivo Alaves, which they won 2-1. Amidst growing reports that the 44-year-old is facing the sack already, his former boss at Leverkusen has spoken out to defend the coach, pointing the finger squarely at the structural differences between the two clubs. Carro, the CEO of the Bundesliga side, believes that Alonso has been left exposed by a Madrid board that fails to protect its managers in times of crisis.

Alonso departed Leverkusen in the summer to take the reins at the Santiago Bernabeu, tasked with leading a new era for Los Blancos. However, results have been mixed, and the Spanish press has already begun to sharpen its knives. For Carro, who oversaw Alonso's historic unbeaten domestic double in Germany, the issue lies not with the tactician's ability, but with the ruthless and often lonely environment fostered by Madrid president Florentino Perez.

Speaking to Sky, Carro did not mince his words when comparing the supportive environment of Leverkusen with the cut-throat politics of Madrid. 

""We didn't advise him on anything,"" Carro said when asked if he had spoken to Alonso about his current predicament. ""At the time we would have liked him to stay here, but we know he is a coach with enormous talent who, yes, finds himself in a different context in Madrid.

""If the president says that a coach is a necessary evil, if the coach is left alone and it is always he who receives the criticism, well then the situation is very different from the one he experienced in Leverkusen, where we all rowed in the same direction and did not leave the coach politically alone.""

Despite the tense situation surrounding Alonso's future, Carro revealed that his personal relationship with the Basque coach remains incredibly strong. The two forged a close bond during Alonso's three-year stint in Germany, a period that transformed Leverkusen from underachievers to history-makers.

Carro confirmed that he recently visited Alonso in the Spanish capital, emphasising that their connection transcends the professional sphere.

""During the international break I was in Madrid for a weekend, and the coaching staff and the family were at our house twice,"" Carro revealed. ""We have a very good relationship; after all, during those three years we were like a family. I also know that they follow our matches and we follow theirs, we follow each other. We feel a lot of appreciation for each other and maintain very close contact.""

The contrast described by Carro serves as a warning to Madrid fans and pundits calling for Alonso's head. However, pressure will only continue to build on the coach unless he brings consistency after a stunning start to his tenure. They started the season with 13 wins from their first 14 games under Alonso, including a victory against Barcelona, but a defeat to Liverpool sparked a dismal run that saw them drop four points behind in La Liga and in danger of falling out of the Champions League's top eight.

While Leverkusen soldier on without him, watching their former manager struggle under the weight of the ""white house"" expectations has evidently struck a nerve with the German club's hierarchy. Whether Perez heeds the subtle warning from his counterpart remains to be seen, but as the sack rumours intensify, the accusation that Alonso has been ""left alone"" will likely resonate with those who feel the manager is being made a scapegoat for wider structural issues.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

If one point captures the essence of Carlos Alcaraz, it is the electrifying Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters moment that earned him Hot Shot of the Year.


Voted by fans on ATPTour.com as the most exciting of the season, Alcaraz's Hot Shot of the Year edged efforts from Grigor Dimitrov and Hubert Hurkacz, who also endeared themselves to fans with stunning from-the-floor winners. Meanwhile, Alcaraz dazzled with instinct and imagination.







Showcasing his signature blend of speed, power and flair all in a single point, the Spaniard raced down a drop shot, carved a sharp angle and then upon a dead sprint, launched a running tweener lob in just the second game of his match against Daniel Altmaier. Alcaraz put his finger to his ear, asking the Monte-Carlo to get involved in the early stages of the third-round match.

Alcaraz went on to claim the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters title, his first triumph in the Principality and one of eight trophies he lifted in 2025. He finished the season as ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF, tallying a 71-9 match record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

The 22-year-old was a regular in this year's ATP Awards. Alcaraz was honoured with the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award for the second time. His coaches Juan Carlos Ferrero and Samuel Lopez won Coach of the Year.

The K-pop powerhouse teams with Brandon Hixon and Colin Gayle to build a global pipeline for African artists and expand its footprint.

Industry News Editor


	HYBE is making a bold move into Africa's booming music market through a global management partnership with industry veterans Brandon Hixon and Colin Gayle, the Korean company announced Monday. 


	The collaboration aims to amplify African artists, foster cross-cultural storytelling and create long-term creative pathways across the U.S., Asia and beyond. Under the initiative, HYBE will build a pipeline for emerging and established talent, sign new artists and provide comprehensive international support. Tyla, the Grammy-winning South African star behind hits including “Water” and “PUSH 2 START,” will be the first artist supported under the initiative. She'll remain under the guidance of Hixon and Gayle, with HYBE adding global scale and resources to her team.


	Hixon and Gayle bring decades of experience championing African music globally, and their alliance with HYBE signals a new era of Black-led creative leadership joining forces with a global entertainment powerhouse. The partnership will deliver expanded resources in touring, marketing, digital strategy, multimedia production and brand partnerships, while enabling cross-artist collaborations within HYBE's roster.


	Hixon and Gayle bring decades of experience elevating African music on a global stage, and their partnership with HYBE marks a new chapter of Black-led creative leadership aligned with a major entertainment company. The alliance will provide expanded support across touring, marketing, digital strategy, production and branding deals, while also opening the door to collaborations with artists across HYBE's global roster.


	“Our work has always been about connecting great artists with the world in the right way,” said Hixon. “HYBE brings a global perspective that complements how Colin and I build. Together, we can help artists move freely and tell their stories on the biggest stages.”


	“We're entering a moment where African artists have unlimited potential,” added Gayle. “With HYBE's collaborative support, we can help them expand their reach while staying true to the roots that make this music extraordinary.”


	African music's global surge — fueled by Afrobeats, Amapiano and platforms like TikTok and YouTube — is driving demand for infrastructure that can scale internationally. IFPI's 2025 Global Music Report underscores this momentum: Sub-Saharan Africa posted a 22.6% revenue increase last year, surpassing $100 million, while North Africa contributed to MENA's 22.8% growth.


	“We are thrilled to partner with cultural architects like Brandon Hixon and Colin Gayle, whose vision is essential to driving the powerful momentum of African artistry onto the global stage,” said Jason Jaesang Lee, CEO of HYBE. “This partnership represents a pivotal moment in HYBE's global expansion strategy. By combining their expertise with our global network and resources, we will establish a strategic, sustainable bridge designed to amplify authentic African voices and artistry to fans across the world.”


	In November, HYBE reported Q3 revenue up 38% year-over-year to 727.2 billion Korean won ($519 million), powered by concert income from BTS' Jin, SEVENTEEN and TXT.

Gavin Newsom Posts Megan Thee Stallion Diss Track as Nicki Minaj Slams His Support of Trans Kids","https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/gavin-newsom-megan-thee-stallion-song-nicki-minaj-beef-1236137608/","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 17:43:35 GMT","

""These h--s don't be mad at Megan, these h--s mad at Megan's law ...""


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Nicki Minaj definitely has a problem with California Governor Gavin Newsom, whose recent comments about transgender children incited a storm of diss posts on X about him from the rapper — but he seems to have clapped back by invoking the words of Megan Thee Stallion.


	It all started with the politician's Dec. 10 appearance on The Ezra Klein Show, where Newsom said that he wants “to see trans kids,” adding, “There's no governor that signed more pro-trans legislation than I have, and no one's been a stronger advocate for the LGBTQ [community].”

	











	Unimpressed by the prospective 2028 presidential candidate's remarks, Minaj unleashed a storm of posts antagonizing him on Friday (Dec. 12). “Imagine being the guy running on wanting to see trans kids,” she wrote. “Haha. Not even a trans ADULT would run on that. Normal adults wake up & think they want to see HEALTHY, SAFE, HAPPY kids.”




	“Gavin is the cute boy who got everything handed to him b/c of how cute & sexy & hot & smoking he was,” Minaj quipped in another post. “He thinks he's Tom Cruise only difference is, his next mission IS impossible. He should get another leading role.”


	In other posts over the next couple of days, the hip-hop star wrote that it's the “end of the road” for Newsom and called him a “Career politician … nothing more than a Nicki Minaj ANTI.”


	Newsom — who has a trans godson — hasn't directly responded to the callouts, but he did post a video that many onlookers have interpreted as shade against Minaj. Captioned with only a mouth-zipped emoji, the montage compiles clips of Newsom and President Donald Trump — for whom Minaj has been showing more and more support online in recent weeks — set to Megan Thee Stallion's Billboard Hot 100-topper “Hiss.”


	The 2024 track is largely considered a diss track against Minaj, who certainly took offense to lyrics such as “These h–s don't be mad at Megan/ These h–s mad at Megan's Law” when Meg first dropped it. Minaj is married to and shares a son with Kenneth Petty, who was ordered to register as a sex offender after his conviction of attempted rape of a 16-year-old girl in 1995; Megan's Law is a federal mandate that requires law enforcement to make information available about registered sex offenders.


	That same lyric plays over a photo of Trump standing next to Jeffrey Epstein — who pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution and soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008, and was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019 — in Newsom's video, which also includes newly released pictures of the president from Epstein's estate.

	











	Minaj appeared to respond to Newsom's video by posting shortly afterward, “Oh gavvy Pooh the ppl behind you clearly don't care about you” and “Pooh this won't get the results you guys are hoping for … I can go 8 stages deeper.”


	“Let's wait…I think Gavvy's still transitioning,” she added before sharing a fake, edited photo of herself putting Newsom in a headlock with her legs in a wrestling ring.

Executive Editor, Television


EXCLUSIVE: Surf's up! Point Break, one of the most iconic films of the 1990s, is getting the TV treatment.


AMC is developing a small-screen series based on the 1991 film that starred Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves, Lori Petty and Gary Busey.


	The series comes from David Kalstein, who recently worked on Amazon's Butterfly; Alcon Television Group; and AMC Studios.


	Deadline understands that the network won the project in a highly competitive situation.

	The original movie, which was directed by Kathryn Bigelow and written by W. Peter Iliff, starred Reeves as rookie FBI agent Johnny Utah, who infiltrates the Ex-Presidents, a gang of Southern California surfers who rob banks. The Ex-Presidents, who wear masks of Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Lyndon B. Johnson and Lyndon Johnson, are led by Swayze's Bodhi, and Utah gets swept up in their daredevil lifestyle before a massive action chase and a reunion amid lethal waves.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The series is set 35 years after the events of the original film and is focused on a dangerous heist crew with ties to the Ex-Presidents gang. 


	Kalstein will write. He exec produces alongside Alcon co-founders and co-CEO's Andrew Kosove and Broderick Johnson and president of television Ben Roberts.


	Kalstein was a co-exec producer on Amazon's Butterfly, which starred Daniel Dae Kim. He also co-exec produced series including CBS' NCIS: Los Angeles, ABC's Quantico and USA Network's Treadstone, co-showrunning the latter. He also developed series including Jade City at Peacock and Quantum Spy at NBC. He's repped at CAA, 42 and Yorn/Levine.

	











Point Break landed a remake in 2015 from director Ericson Core that starred Edgar Ramirez, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Delroy Lindo and Ray Winstone. It was produced by Alcon's Kosove and Johnson.


	AMC has recently had success with another series with a ‘90s film; Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire. The series is set to air its third season next year and Mayfair Witches, which is also based in Rice's Immortal Universe, has also been renewed for a third season.

EXCLUSIVE: Zachary Hart (Slow Horses) has been cast as a series regular in Netflix's Assassin's Creed. He joins previously cast leads Toby Wallace and Lola Petticrew in the live-action series based on Ubisoft's best-selling video game franchise.


Assassin's Creed is a high-octane thriller centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions — one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny.

	Roberto Patino and David Wiener serve as showrunners on Assassin's Creed, which stems from a deal Netflix signed with Ubisoft in 2020. They executive produce with Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, Genevieve Jones for Ubisoft Film & Television, and Matt O'Toole.


	With more than 230 million units sold, the Assassin's Creed franchise is one of the best-selling series in video game history.


	Hart is a British actor-musician who most recently starred as Reg in the West End production of the Tony-winning Stereophonic. Earlier this year, he played Medvedenko in The Seagull at the Barbican Theatre. 


	On TV, Hart has guest starred on such series as Apple TV's Slow Horses and Masters of the Air, Netflix's The Witcher: Blood Origin and Bodies, BBC's Peaky Blinders and ITV's Doc Martin. He is currently filming Season 2 of Netflix's spy action thriller Black Doves and can next be seen in Hugo Blick's California Avenue for the BBC, alongside Bill Nighy and Helena Bonham-Carter, and Channel 4's Big Mood, opposite Nicola Coughlan. 

	











	Hart, who recently debuted his short film Chimera at the BFI London Film Festival, is repped by Insight Management & Production.

The USC Libraries have named the 2026 finalists for their 38th annual Scripter Awards, which honor the year's most accomplished adaptations of the written word for the screen. The awards, which go to one film and one television series, recognize both the authors of the original works and the screenwriters who adapted them.

Additionally, author Michael Connelly, responsible for the novels that became hit television series like “Bosch” and “The Lincoln Lawyer,” will accept the USC Libraries Literary Achievement Award at the Scripter ceremony for his contributions to the art of mystery storytelling, both on the page and on the screen.

On the film side, the Scripter Award has been a serious bellwether for the Oscars, having predicted four out of five of the last few Best Adapted Screenplay award winners. Screenwriter Peter Straughan, who won the film award in 2025 for “Conclave” alongside novelist Robert Harris, is nominated again this year for the TV award for his work adapting Hilary Mantel's novel “The Mirror and the Light” into the PBS series “Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light.”

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






One big change with the Scripter Awards this year is that, in their focus on honoring the written word as a source of inspiration for screen storytellers, only works adapted from books or book series, novellas, short stories, graphic novels, plays, or magazine articles are eligible. Video games and characters originating in previously published works are no longer considered eligible source material, so films like “Wake Up Dead Man” and “Bugonia” were not in the running for the film award.

The 2026 Scripter selection committee selected the finalists from a field of 43 film and 64 television adaptations. USC professor Howard Rodman, a former president of the Writers Guild of America, West, chairs the committee, which includes journalists, authors, screenwriters, producers, and Elizabeth Daley, dean of the USC School of Cinematic Arts.

The USC Libraries will announce the winning authors and screenwriters at a black-tie ceremony on Saturday, Jan. 24, 2026, in the Town & Gown ballroom at the University of Southern California.

The finalist writers for film adaptation are, in alphabetical order by film title: 

Guillermo del Toro for “Frankenstein” based on the novel “Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus” by Mary Shelley

Chloe Zhao and Maggie O'Farrell for “Hamnet” based on O'Farrell's novel of the same name

 










Paul Thomas Anderson for “One Battle After Another” based on the novel “Vineland” by Thomas Pynchon

Ira Sachs for “Peter Hujar's Day” based on the book of the same name by Linda Rosenkrantz

Clint Bentley and Greg Kwedar for “Train Dreams” based on the novella of the same name by Denis Johnson

The finalist writers for episodic series are, in alphabetical order by series title: 

Max Hurwitz and Billy Luther for the episode “Ábidoo'niidę́ę́ (What He Had Been Told),” from “Dark Winds,” based on the novels “Dancehall of the Dead” and “The Sinister Pig” by Tony Hillerman 

Mike Makowsky for the episode “Destiny of the Republic,” from “Death by Lightning,” based on Candice Millard's nonfiction book “Destiny of the Republic: A Tale of Madness, Medicine, and the Murder of a President” 

Chandni Lakhani and Scott Frank for the untitled first episode of “Dept. Q,” based on the novel “The Keeper of Lost Causes” by Jussi Adler-Olsen 

Will Smith for the episode “Scars,” from “Slow Horses,” based on the novel “London Rules” by Mick Herron

W
hen Kendrick Lamar knocked out Drake with 2024's “Not Like Us,” he did so with pomp and flair. It was an epic musical showdown that concluded with Lamar being crowned not just the victor of the moment, but rap's reigning ruler — and that moment made a lot of noise. But when Lamar deployed GNX several months later, he proved that being cool and calculating can be just as deadly.


	The sixth studio album in Lamar's discog, GNX arrived on DSPs without warning in November 2024. Widely considered a victory lap for Lamar and his camp, the project was hailed as confirmation of his kingship. It's now been nominated in a host of major categories for the 2026 Grammy Awards — it's tied to nine total nominations — including Album of the Year.


	However, according to Sounwave, Lamar's chief producer and longtime friend, GNX was in the works long before any gauntlets were thrown. The foundation for the album was laid in late 2022 and early 2023, after the L.A. rapper finished the first leg of his Big Steppers World Tour.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Speaking exclusively with Rolling Stone about the album's creation, Sounwave, who oversaw the bulk of GNX with co-producer Jack Antonoff, recalls the first two songs recorded were “Squabble Up” and “Man at the Garden.”


	“I remember putting [the sample] in the MPC and chopping it up,” he says of “Squabble Up,” for which he enlisted producer Scott Bridgeway — “a master of the 808” — to come up with the beat. “He put his imprint into it, and it finally started to form into something. But it was way too fast. Once we slowed it down, we knew we had something special.” 

	











	“Man at the Garden” stands as one of GNX's more introspective performances. Sounwave recalls recording the song in New York with Antonoff, and getting rap legend Nas' blessing to interpolate his Stillmatic song “One Mic” on the track — but it was Lamar's rhythm that brought it all together. “It started to form into something where Dot just all of a sudden had this flow,” the producer says. “The flow felt so nostalgic, so personal, and we just built off of that.”

	According to Sounwave, not all of the tracks were initially intended to be full songs. “Luther,” the massive SZA collaboration, started off as an interlude and took shape with help from the songwriter Ink. “I got a call from our boy Sounwave, ‘Yo, pull up on this,'” Ink says. “We been locked in since then. It's always good to work with people that inspire you.” 


	Now, the Luther Vandross-sampling cut is up for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Melodic Rap Performance at the Feb. 1 awards. 


	“There were no drums. It was literally me chopping the sample and Dot just humming melodies. We had the sample in the tuck forever, we just never could crack it,” Sounwave says. “But once he hit this one specific melody, I knew that this had to be bigger.” The shift in creative direction illustrated how material thought to be minor became central to GNX.


	Sometimes that happened with the assist of another producer. While Sounwave was the chief architect, he leaned on a secret weapon, Mustard, on tracks like “Hey Now.” “Mustard comes through when he needs to come through,” he says, “and he popped up with that record. I remember, instantly, everybody in the room started to dance and we never could let it go.”

	The seismic “TV Off,” up for Best Rap Song, evolved from a single idea into a two-part composition with help from jazz virtuoso Kamasi Washington, another credited producer on GNX who has worked on every Kendrick project since To Pimp a Butterfly. “Kamasi replayed the string section, and it just started to get bigger,” Sounwave says.


	“It felt like I was a part of a group of people that were all very brilliant,” Washington tells RS. “It felt like an honor. It felt like, ‘Let me do my little part to add to it.' I tried to absorb being with everybody else. I kind of have trust in Kendrick and all of them, and they got to take it to a place that's the ultimate level.”

	











	Everyone knew right away that the moment in “TV Off” where Kendrick shouts out Mustard's name would be a fan favorite. “Once everybody first heard that ‘MUSTARD!,' the reaction was instant laughter, joy, and energy,” Sounwave says. And Lefty Gunplay, whose six-word contribution to the same song is another highlight, recalls the positive vibe in the room: “I had a note pad and I was writing. Then Kendrick Lamar walked in the studio, came straight up to me, gave me a hug,” he says. “He told me that he's had his eye on me and that I'm doing my thing in Los Angeles. That I'm the missing piece of the West.”


	Elsewhere, “Wacced out Murals,” the song that opens GNX, was born out of an unexpected early-morning recording session driven by Kendrick himself. “Yeah, that was 100 percent a Kendrick moment,” Sounwave notes. “I think he did that at like 6 a.m. one night. I just remember being excited and getting pumped up from hearing it. I wasn't even in the room when he created that.”


	But the album's heart and soul lie in two distinct callbacks. “Reincarnated” is a fiery reimagining of 2Pac's posthumous cut “Made Niggaz,” while “Heart Pt. 6” samples SWV's “Use Your Heart.”


	The creation of “Reincarnated” required substantial reconstruction to preserve the authenticity of 2Pac's original. It was difficult to navigate, Sounwave says, because of the way “Made Niggaz,” which originally appeared on the soundtrack to the 1997 film Gang Related, is regarded as a conceptual masterpiece. 


	“That's Pac. That's Gang Related soundtrack. That's a moment for us, and we didn't want to mess it up. I knew we couldn't just sample it,” he says. To pay proper respect to the original, Sounwave brought in bassist Noah Ehler and pianist Matthew “MTech” Bernard to record new parts. “It started to feel more tailored to what we were going through,” Sounwave says.


	Lamar and Sounwave are both proud Los Angelenos, and they give a nod to their hometown ballclub on “Dodger Blue,” featuring Wallie the Sensei, Siete7x, and Roddy Ricch. The song, released between two World Series wins for the city, underscores GNX's themes of hometown pride and creative camaraderie — it takes a team, after all.


	Siete7x notes that he was particularly proud of sharing the track with three other artists from the same section of the M.A.A.D. City. “I was proud,” he says.  “I was smiling ear to ear, just grateful. We all from the same west side of Compton. We all from that little circle, that bubble, so that really felt good. We all come from the same place, trying to come out, make it out, and we're doing it. We're dedicated, we're making it happen.”

	











	Two more songs on GNX that capture that sentiment: “Peekaboo,” featuring AzChike, and the album's title track with Hitta J3, YoungThreat, and Peysoh. Sounwave says they emphasize Lamar's desire to collaborate with intention and showcase artists he respects. “That's who his character has always been,” Sounwave says. “[He's] just like, ‘I believe in y'all. I want you guys to shine.'”


	Peysoh agrees. “It was all around good vibes,” he tells RS. “Everything was so natural. Conversations just flowed. We touched on certain topics with each other before even making any music, for real. It was just an all-around dope experience. Kendrick is a very humble, down to earth individual. He definitely did his thing for the West Coast, and brought out some of the [rising] artists. Gave us a platform, a spotlight, and boosted our voice, all together.”


	Case in point: the vocal contributions throughout the album from mariachi singer Deyra Barrera. “Compton is a small city, but it's a big gumbo pot. My neighbors will play Juan Gabriel all day, loud,” Sounwave says. “That was a missing piece to us. We needed to capture the same feeling we had back then. And when she came in, it was just magical instantly. She understood. Hopped in a booth and had everybody in the room chills.”

	But after years of studio work, sometimes into the wee hours, how did K. Dot and Sounwave know it was time for GNX to shine? It all comes down to emotion, the producer says.


	“If I don't shed a tear by the last second of the album, it is not ready,” Sounwave says. “Once that last second of the last song stopped, 6 a.m. in the morning, I shed a tear. I was like, ‘We're done.'”

Adam Scott has plenty of experience with the horrific and weird, having starred in the likes of Severance, Little Evil, Krampus, Piranha 3D, and Hellraiser: Bloodline. Earlier this year, we learned that he's adding to his genre résumé with the supernatural horror film Hokum, which was filmed on location in Ireland. A few months ago, it was announced that NEON and Waypoint Entertainment's Cweature Features have boarded the project, with NEON planning to give the film a theatrical release in the United States on May 1, 2026. We still have a while to wait for this one, but the marketing has begun with the release of a creepy teaser trailer, which can be viewed in the embed above.

Hokum is coming our way from writer/director Damian McCarthy, whose horror film Oddity is said to have “caused a stir after premiering at SXSW, where it won the audience award in the Midnighter section.” That movie made its way out into the world last summer, telling the story of “a blind medium and curio shopkeeper who is still grieving the death of her twin sister a year prior when a wooden mannequin from her collection becomes crucial to her quest to uncover the truth about her sister's murder.” The story McCarthy has crafted for Hokum will see Scott taking on the role of a horror novelist who visits a remote Irish inn to spread his parents' ashes, unaware the place is rumored to be haunted by a witch. Here's the synopsis: When reclusive novelist Ohm Bauman (Scott) retreats to a remote Irish inn to scatter his parents' ashes, the staff's tales of an ancient witch haunting the honeymoon suite take hold of his mind. Soon, disturbing visions and a shocking disappearance draw him into a nightmarish confrontation with the darkest corners of his past. Scott is joined in the cast by Peter Coonan (Bad Sisters) and David Wilmot (Bodkin).

Cweature Features are co-producers on the project, joining Image Nation and Spooky Pictures, as well as Team Thrives, who co-financed. 

Hokum is being produced by Spooky Pictures' Roy Lee and Steven Schneider, Image Nation's Derek Dauchy, and Tailored Film's Ruth Treacy, Julianne Forde, and Mairtín de Barra. Ben Ross, Dan Kagan, Rami Yasin, and Andrew Childs serve as executive producers. Cweature Features' Ken Kao and Josh Rosenbaum are executive producers as well. The project is also supported by co-production funding from Screen Ireland/ Fís Éireann.

Individuals on the political right are more vulnerable to conspiracy theories than those on the left, according to a new study.

This is the conclusion of psychologist Julia Aspernäs of Sweden's Linköping University, who found modest—yet statistically significant—differences in how individuals across the political spectrum respond to various forms of misinformation. 

Aspernäs found that while the political left and right are equally prone to certain kinds of flawed reasoning, those on the political right are more susceptible to conspiracy theories. 

However, her analysis also revealed that almost everyone, regardless of ideology, tends to accept political claims that align with their own beliefs.

In her study, Aspernäs surveyed nearly 2,500 adults in Sweden and the U.K. In a series of specifically designed tests, they looked at three major categories of misinformation: logical fallacies, conspiracy theories and pseudo-profound nonsense. 

In examining logical fallacies, participants were presented with a series of politically charged syllogisms—logical statements requiring deduction. Some of these statements leaned left, others right. 

The researchers found that when a syllogism spoke to an individual's ideological concerns, whether left or right-leaning, they always demonstrated a similar impairment in reasoning and made logical errors regardless of their political alignment.

Explaining this response, Aspernäs said in a statement that “we simply become worse at evaluating information in areas that matter to us, where it affects our self-image.”

When it came to looking at conspiracy theories, participants were tasked with looking at a series of statements claiming there were covert plots behind major societal events. Most were politically neutral, but when they were politically loaded, the researchers offered a balance between right and left. 

The results highlighted how those identifying themselves as right-leaning are more likely to accept conspiracy theories than left-leaning individuals. Though the correlation was weak, it was deemed statistically significant. The study also found people on the right were also more willing to spread conspiracy theories than people on the left.

Researchers then gauged participants' openness to “pseudo-profound nonsense—abstract, seemingly meaningful statements devoid of real substance."" Here no significant ideological difference emerged with both groups being equally susceptible.

Reflecting on the findings, Aspernäs offered up several hypotheses as to why the political right seems more inclined to fall for conspiracy theories.

She believes that right-wing communities may circulate a disproportionate number of conspiracy theories, therefore increasing individual exposure and normalising acceptance.

Aspernäs also noted that conservative thinkers often adopt a precautionary, threat-focused worldview that may make them more receptive to conspiratorial explanations involving malevolent forces. 

She added that a tendency toward anti-democratic sentiments—which stretch across the ideological spectrum—might too facilitate openness to conspiracy theories. 

Despite her findings, Aspernäs stressed that the overall correlation was weak. “I don't know whether it helps us move forward, for example in public debate, by singling out certain groups,” she said. “The correlations we see, where right-leaning people stand out, are not very strong.” 

Ultimately, Aspernäs believes further exploration is required in order to better clarify causation and find out whether the right-wing predisposition is fundamental, or a byproduct of social environment and psychological traits.

In 2022, a study published in the journal Political Behavior rejected the notion that Republicans and Conservatives are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories. Researchers surveyed beliefs across a broad sample of 52 conspiracy theories in the U.S. and 11 conspiracy theories internationally.

A second test saw the researchers hold constant the content of the conspiracy theories investigated—manipulating only the partisanship of the theorized villains—to decipher whether those on the left or right are more likely to accuse political out-groups of conspiring. 

They concluded that the relationship between political ideology and conspiracy belief is not uniform—it depends heavily on the specific content and context of the conspiracy. While conservatives were often reported to have stronger conspiracy beliefs, the strength and direction of this link varied across different theories and national settings.

Startups flush with cash are building AI-assisted laboratories to find materials far faster and more cheaply, but are still waiting for their ChatGPT moment.

The microwave-size instrument at Lila Sciences in Cambridge, Massachusetts, doesn't look all that different from others that I've seen in state-of-the-art materials labs. Inside its vacuum chamber, the machine zaps a palette of different elements to create vaporized particles, which then fly through the chamber and land to create a thin film, using a technique called sputtering. What sets this instrument apart is that artificial intelligence is running the experiment; an AI agent, trained on vast amounts of scientific literature and data, has determined the recipe and is varying the combination of elements. 

Later, a person will walk the samples, each containing multiple potential catalysts, over to a different part of the lab for testing. Another AI agent will scan and interpret the data, using it to suggest another round of experiments to try to optimize the materials' performance.  

This story is part of MIT Technology Review's Hype Correction package, a series that resets expectations about what AI is, what it makes possible, and where we go next.

For now, a human scientist keeps a close eye on the experiments and will approve the next steps on the basis of the AI's suggestions and the test results. But the startup is convinced this AI-controlled machine is a peek into the future of materials discovery—one in which autonomous labs could make it far cheaper and faster to come up with novel and useful compounds. 

Flush with hundreds of millions of dollars in new funding, Lila Sciences is one of AI's latest unicorns. The company is on a larger mission to use AI-run autonomous labs for scientific discovery—the goal is to achieve what it calls scientific superintelligence. But I'm here this morning to learn specifically about the discovery of new materials. 

We desperately need better materials to solve our problems. We'll need improved electrodes and other parts for more powerful batteries; compounds to more cheaply suck carbon dioxide out of the air; and better catalysts to make green hydrogen and other clean fuels and chemicals. And we will likely need novel materials like higher-temperature superconductors, improved magnets, and different types of semiconductors for a next generation of breakthroughs in everything from quantum computing to fusion power to AI hardware. 

But materials science has not had many commercial wins in the last few decades. In part because of its complexity and the lack of successes, the field has become something of an innovation backwater, overshadowed by the more glamorous—and lucrative—search for new drugs and insights into biology.

The idea of using AI for materials discovery is not exactly new, but it got a huge boost in 2020 when DeepMind showed that its AlphaFold2 model could accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins. Then, in 2022, came the success and popularity of ChatGPT. The hope that similar AI models using deep learning could aid in doing science captivated tech insiders. Why not use our new generative AI capabilities to search the vast chemical landscape and help simulate atomic structures, pointing the way to new substances with amazing properties?

“Simulations can be super powerful for framing problems and understanding what is worth testing in the lab. But there's zero problems we can ever solve in the real world with simulation alone.”

Researchers touted an AI model that had reportedly discovered “millions of new materials.” The money began pouring in, funding a host of startups. But so far there has been no “eureka” moment, no ChatGPT-like breakthrough—no discovery of new miracle materials or even slightly better ones.

The startups that want to find useful new compounds face a common bottleneck: By far the most time-consuming and expensive step in materials discovery is not imagining new structures but making them in the real world. Before trying to synthesize a material, you don't know if, in fact, it can be made and is stable, and many of its properties remain unknown until you test it in the lab.

“Simulations can be super powerful for kind of framing problems and understanding what is worth testing in the lab,” says John Gregoire, Lila Sciences' chief autonomous science officer. “But there's zero problems we can ever solve in the real world with simulation alone.” 

Startups like Lila Sciences have staked their strategies on using AI to transform experimentation and are building labs that use agents to plan, run, and interpret the results of experiments to synthesize new materials. Automation in laboratories already exists. But the idea is to have AI agents take it to the next level by directing autonomous labs, where their tasks could include designing experiments and controlling the robotics used to shuffle samples around. And, most important, companies want to use AI to vacuum up and analyze the vast amount of data produced by such experiments in the search for clues to better materials.

If they succeed, these companies could shorten the discovery process from decades to a few years or less, helping uncover new materials and optimize existing ones. But it's a gamble. Even though AI is already taking over many laboratory chores and tasks, finding new—and useful—materials on its own is another matter entirely. 

I have been reporting about materials discovery for nearly 40 years, and to be honest, there have been only a few memorable commercial breakthroughs, such as lithium-­ion batteries, over that time. There have been plenty of scientific advances to write about, from perovskite solar cells to graphene transistors to metal-­organic frameworks (MOFs), materials based on an intriguing type of molecular architecture that recently won its inventors a Nobel Prize. But few of those advances—including MOFs—have made it far out of the lab. Others, like quantum dots, have found some commercial uses, but in general, the kinds of life-changing inventions created in earlier decades have been lacking. 

Blame the amount of time (typically 20 years or more) and the hundreds of millions of dollars it takes to make, test, optimize, and manufacture a new material—and the industry's lack of interest in spending that kind of time and money in low-margin commodity markets. Or maybe we've just run out of ideas for making stuff.

The need to both speed up that process and find new ideas is the reason researchers have turned to AI. For decades, scientists have used computers to design potential materials, calculating where to place atoms to form structures that are stable and have predictable characteristics. It's worked—but only kind of. Advances in AI have made that computational modeling far faster and have promised the ability to quickly explore a vast number of possible structures. Google DeepMind, Meta, and Microsoft have all launched efforts to bring AI tools to the problem of designing new materials. 

But the limitations that have always plagued computational modeling of new materials remain. With many types of materials, such as crystals, useful characteristics often can't be predicted solely by calculating atomic structures.

To uncover and optimize those properties, you need to make something real. Or as Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli, one of Lila's cofounders and an MIT professor of materials science, puts it: “Structure helps us think about the problem, but it's neither necessary nor sufficient for real materials problems.”

Perhaps no advance exemplified the gap between the virtual and physical worlds more than DeepMind's announcement in late 2023 that it had used deep learning to discover “millions of new materials,” including 380,000 crystals that it declared “the most stable, making them promising candidates for experimental synthesis.” In technical terms, the arrangement of atoms represented a minimum energy state where they were content to stay put. This was “an order-of-magnitude expansion in stable materials known to humanity,” the DeepMind researchers proclaimed.

To the AI community, it appeared to be the breakthrough everyone had been waiting for. The DeepMind research not only offered a gold mine of possible new materials, it also created powerful new computational methods for predicting a large number of structures.

But some materials scientists had a far different reaction. After closer scrutiny, researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said they'd found “scant evidence for compounds that fulfill the trifecta of novelty, credibility, and utility.” In fact, the scientists reported, they didn't find any truly novel compounds among the ones they looked at; some were merely “trivial” variations of known ones. The scientists appeared particularly peeved that the potential compounds were labeled materials. They wrote: “We would respectfully suggest that the work does not report any new materials but reports a list of proposed compounds. In our view, a compound can be called a material when it exhibits some functionality and, therefore, has potential utility.”

Some of the imagined crystals simply defied the conditions of the real world. To do computations on so many possible structures, DeepMind researchers simulated them at absolute zero, where atoms are well ordered; they vibrate a bit but don't move around. At higher temperatures—the kind that would exist in the lab or anywhere in the world—the atoms fly about in complex ways, often creating more disorderly crystal structures. A number of the so-called novel materials predicted by DeepMind appeared to be well-ordered versions of disordered ones that were already known. 

More generally, the DeepMind paper was simply another reminder of how challenging it is to capture physical realities in virtual simulations—at least for now. Because of the limitations of computational power, researchers typically perform calculations on relatively few atoms. Yet many desirable properties are determined by the microstructure of the materials—at a scale much larger than the atomic world. And some effects, like high-temperature superconductivity or even the catalysis that is key to many common industrial processes, are far too complex or poorly understood to be explained by atomic simulations alone.

Even so, there are signs that the divide between simulations and experimental work is beginning to narrow. DeepMind, for one, says that since the release of the 2023 paper it has been working with scientists in labs around the world to synthesize AI-identified compounds and has achieved some success. Meanwhile, a number of the startups entering the space are looking to combine computational and experimental expertise in one organization. 

One such startup is Periodic Labs, cofounded by Ekin Dogus Cubuk, a physicist who led the scientific team that generated the 2023 DeepMind headlines, and by Liam Fedus, a co-creator of ChatGPT at OpenAI. Despite its founders' background in computational modeling and AI software, the company is building much of its materials discovery strategy around synthesis done in automated labs. 

The vision behind the startup is to link these different fields of expertise by using large language models that are trained on scientific literature and able to learn from ongoing experiments. An LLM might suggest the recipe and conditions to make a compound; it can also interpret test data and feed additional suggestions to the startup's chemists and physicists. In this strategy, simulations might suggest possible material candidates, but they are also used to help explain the experimental results and suggest possible structural tweaks.

The grand prize would be a room-temperature superconductor, a material that could transform computing and electricity but that has eluded scientists for decades.

Periodic Labs, like Lila Sciences, has ambitions beyond designing and making new materials. It wants to “create an AI scientist”—specifically, one adept at the physical sciences. “LLMs have gotten quite good at distilling chemistry information, physics information,” says Cubuk, “and now we're trying to make it more advanced by teaching it how to do science—for example, doing simulations, doing experiments, doing theoretical modeling.”

The approach, like that of Lila Sciences, is based on the expectation that a better understanding of the science behind materials and their synthesis will lead to clues that could help researchers find a broad range of new ones. One target for Periodic Labs is materials whose properties are defined by quantum effects, such as new types of magnets. The grand prize would be a room-temperature superconductor, a material that could transform computing and electricity but that has eluded scientists for decades.

Superconductors are materials in which electricity flows without any resistance and, thus, without producing heat. So far, the best of these materials become superconducting only at relatively low temperatures and require significant cooling. If they can be made to work at or close to room temperature, they could lead to far more efficient power grids, new types of quantum computers, and even more practical high-speed magnetic-levitation trains. 

The failure to find a room-­temperature superconductor is one of the great disappointments in materials science over the last few decades. I was there when President Reagan spoke about the technology in 1987, during the peak hype over newly made ceramics that became superconducting at the relatively balmy temperature of 93 Kelvin (that's −292 °F), enthusing that they “bring us to the threshold of a new age.” There was a sense of optimism among the scientists and businesspeople in that packed ballroom at the Washington Hilton as Reagan anticipated “a host of benefits, not least among them a reduced dependence on foreign oil, a cleaner environment, and a stronger national economy.” In retrospect, it might have been one of the last times that we pinned our economic and technical aspirations on a breakthrough in materials.

The promised new age never came. Scientists still have not found a material that becomes superconducting at room temperatures, or anywhere close, under normal conditions. The best existing superconductors are brittle and tend to make lousy wires.

One of the reasons that finding higher-­temperature superconductors has been so difficult is that no theory explains the effect at relatively high temperatures—or can predict it simply from the placement of atoms in the structure. It will ultimately fall to lab scientists to synthesize any interesting candidates, test them, and search the resulting data for clues to understanding the still puzzling phenomenon. Doing so, says Cubuk, is one of the top priorities of Periodic Labs. 

It can take a researcher a year or more to make a crystal structure for the first time. Then there are typically years of further work to test its properties and figure out how to make the larger quantities needed for a commercial product. 

Startups like Lila Sciences and Periodic Labs are pinning their hopes largely on the prospect that AI-directed experiments can slash those times. One reason for the optimism is that many labs have already incorporated a lot of automation, for everything from preparing samples to shuttling test items around. Researchers routinely use robotic arms, software, automated versions of microscopes and other analytical instruments, and mechanized tools for manipulating lab equipment.

The automation allows, among other things, for high-throughput synthesis, in which multiple samples with various combinations of ingredients are rapidly created and screened in large batches, greatly speeding up the experiments.

The idea is that using AI to plan and run such automated synthesis can make it far more systematic and efficient. AI agents, which can collect and analyze far more data than any human possibly could, can use real-time information to vary the ingredients and synthesis conditions until they get a sample with the optimal properties. Such AI-directed labs could do far more experiments than a person and could be far smarter than existing systems for high-throughput synthesis. 

But so-called self-driving labs for materials are still a work in progress.

Many types of materials require solid-­state synthesis, a set of processes that are far more difficult to automate than the liquid-­handling activities that are commonplace in making drugs. You need to prepare and mix powders of multiple inorganic ingredients in the right combination for making, say, a catalyst and then decide how to process the sample to create the desired structure—for example, identifying the right temperature and pressure at which to carry out the synthesis. Even determining what you've made can be tricky.

In 2023, the A-Lab at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory claimed to be the first fully automated lab to use inorganic powders as starting ingredients. Subsequently, scientists reported that the autonomous lab had used robotics and AI to synthesize and test 41 novel materials, including some predicted in the DeepMind database. Some critics questioned the novelty of what was produced and complained that the automated analysis of the materials was not up to experimental standards, but the Berkeley researchers defended the effort as simply a demonstration of the autonomous system's potential.

“How it works today and how we envision it are still somewhat different. There's just a lot of tool building that needs to be done,” says Gerbrand Ceder, the principal scientist behind the A-Lab. 

AI agents are already getting good at doing many laboratory chores, from preparing recipes to interpreting some kinds of test data—finding, for example, patterns in a micrograph that might be hidden to the human eye. But Ceder is hoping the technology could soon “capture human decision-making,” analyzing ongoing experiments to make strategic choices on what to do next. For example, his group is working on an improved synthesis agent that would better incorporate what he calls scientists' “diffused” knowledge—the kind gained from extensive training and experience. “I imagine a world where people build agents around their expertise, and then there's sort of an uber-model that puts it together,” he says. “The uber-model essentially needs to know what agents it can call on and what they know, or what their expertise is.”

“In one field that I work in, solid-state batteries, there are 50 papers published every day. And that is just one field that I work in. The A I revolution is about finally gathering all the scientific data we have.”

One of the strengths of AI agents is their ability to devour vast amounts of scientific literature. “In one field that I work in, solid-­state batteries, there are 50 papers published every day. And that is just one field that I work in,” says Ceder. It's impossible for anyone to keep up. “The AI revolution is about finally gathering all the scientific data we have,” he says. 

Last summer, Ceder became the chief science officer at an AI materials discovery startup called Radical AI and took a sabbatical from the University of California, Berkeley, to help set up its self-driving labs in New York City. A slide deck shows the portfolio of different AI agents and generative models meant to help realize Ceder's vision. If you look closely, you can spot an LLM called the “orchestrator”—it's what CEO Joseph Krause calls the “head honcho.” 

So far, despite the hype around the use of AI to discover new materials and the growing momentum—and money—behind the field, there still has not been a convincing big win. There is no example like the 2016 victory of DeepMind's AlphaGo over a Go world champion. Or like AlphaFold's achievement in mastering one of biomedicine's hardest and most time-consuming chores, predicting 3D structures of proteins. 

The field of materials discovery is still waiting for its moment. It could come if AI agents can dramatically speed the design or synthesis of practical materials, similar to but better than what we have today. Or maybe the moment will be the discovery of a truly novel one, such as a room-­temperature superconductor.

With or without such a breakthrough moment, startups face the challenge of trying to turn their scientific achievements into useful materials. The task is particularly difficult because any new materials would likely have to be commercialized in an industry dominated by large incumbents that are not particularly prone to risk-taking.

Susan Schofer, a tech investor and partner at the venture capital firm SOSV, is cautiously optimistic about the field. But Schofer, who spent several years in the mid-2000s as a catalyst researcher at one of the first startups using automation and high-throughput screening for materials discovery (it didn't survive), wants to see some evidence that the technology can translate into commercial successes when she evaluates startups to invest in.  

In particular, she wants to see evidence that the AI startups are already “finding something new, that's different, and know how they are going to iterate from there.” And she wants to see a business model that captures the value of new materials. She says, “I think the ideal would be: I got a spec from the industry. I know what their problem is. We've defined it. Now we're going to go build it. Now we have a new material that we can sell, that we have scaled up enough that we've proven it. And then we partner somehow to manufacture it, but we get revenue off selling the material.”

Schofer says that while she gets the vision of trying to redefine science, she'd advise startups to “show us how you're going to get there.” She adds, “Let's see the first steps.”

Demonstrating those first steps could be essential in enticing large existing materials companies to embrace AI technologies more fully. Corporate researchers in the industry have been burned before—by the promise over the decades that increasingly powerful computers will magically design new materials; by combinatorial chemistry, a fad that raced through materials R&D labs in the early 2000s with little tangible result; and by the promise that synthetic biology would make our next generation of chemicals and materials.

More recently, the materials community has been blanketed by a new hype cycle around AI. Some of that hype was fueled by the 2023 DeepMind announcement of the discovery of “millions of new materials,” a claim that, in retrospect, clearly overpromised. And it was further fueled when an MIT economics student posted a paper in late 2024 claiming that a large, unnamed corporate R&D lab had used AI to efficiently invent a slew of new materials. AI, it seemed, was already revolutionizing the industry.

A few months later, the MIT economics department concluded that “the paper should be withdrawn from public discourse.” Two prominent MIT economists who are acknowledged in a footnote in the paper added that they had “no confidence in the provenance, reliability or validity of the data and the veracity of the research.”

Can AI move beyond the hype and false hopes and truly transform materials discovery? Maybe. There is ample evidence that it's changing how materials scientists work, providing them—if nothing else—with useful lab tools. Researchers are increasingly using LLMs to query the scientific literature and spot patterns in experimental data. 

But it's still early days in turning those AI tools into actual materials discoveries. The use of AI to run autonomous labs, in particular, is just getting underway; making and testing stuff takes time and lots of money. The morning I visited Lila Sciences, its labs were largely empty, and it's now preparing to move into a much larger space a few miles away. Periodic Labs is just beginning to set up its lab in San Francisco. It's starting with manual synthesis guided by AI predictions; its robotic high-throughput lab will come soon. Radical AI reports that its lab is almost fully autonomous but plans to soon move to a larger space.

When I talk to the scientific founders of these startups, I hear a renewed excitement about a field that long operated in the shadows of drug discovery and genomic medicine. For one thing, there is the money. “You see this enormous enthusiasm to put AI and materials together,” says Ceder. “I've never seen this much money flow into materials.”

Reviving the materials industry is a challenge that goes beyond scientific advances, however. It means selling companies on a whole new way of doing R&D.

But the startups benefit from a huge dose of confidence borrowed from the rest of the AI industry. And maybe that, after years of playing it safe, is just what the materials business needs. 

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you'll see it's a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won't compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","How GLP-1s really affect breast, other cancer risk: Latest evidence","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/glp-1s-may-have-little-to-no-impact-on-breast-thyroid-cancer-risk","Mon, 15 Dec 2025 06:40:48 GMT","

Researchers estimate that, in 2022, about 890 million adults around the world — or one in every eight — were living with obesity.

While obesity can increase a person's risk for several health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and kidney disease, studies have also linked it to a heightened risk for a number of cancers. 

Obesity-related cancers include thyroid, pancreatic, breast, kidney, colorectal, esophageal, liver, gallbladder, ovarian, gastric, and endometrial cancers, as well as the plasma cell cancer multiple myeloma and meningioma, which is a tumor that grows between the skull and spinal cord.

Now, a new study published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine provides evidence suggesting that the currently popular glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist medications for weight loss, such as Wegovy and Zepbound, likely have little to no impact on a person's obesity-related cancer risk. 

For this study, researchers analyzed findings from 48 previously-conducted trials examining the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 drugs on people with type 2 diabetes, overweight, or obesity, involving a total of more than 94,000 participants. 

“GLP-1 receptor agonists are now being used by millions of people worldwide for diabetes and obesity, yet their long-term cancer safety has remained uncertain,” Cho-Han Chiang, MD, MMSc, clinician investigator in the Department of Medicine in Mount Auburn Hospital at Harvard Medical School in Massachusetts, and corresponding author of this study, told Medical News Today.

“Early observational studies and case reports raised concerns about potential links with certain cancers (e.g. thyroid, pancreatic cancers),” Chiang noted.

“At the same time, other observational studies have suggested a lower risk of certain cancers, particularly obesity-related cancers, with GLP-1RA use,” he added. “This mixture of signals has contributed to uncertainty in the field and the need to investigate further.” 

Chiang said they chose to specifically study obesity-related cancers because these cancers are strongly influenced by excess adiposity, chronic inflammation, and metabolic dysregulation. 

“Obesity increases the risk of these malignancies — there are 13 types of cancer recognized as associated with obesity — and GLP-1 receptor agonists produce meaningful and sustained weight loss,” he continued.

“This raises the question of whether GLP-1RAs could reduce the risk of obesity-related cancers. Recent observational studies have suggested possible protective associations — patients using GLP-1RAs appeared to have lower rates of certain obesity-related cancers.”

“However, these are data from non-randomized studies with [the] possibility of confounding factors at play,” Chiang noted.

“Our study pulls together cancer events across large randomized clinical trials to provide a more rigorous and comprehensive assessment of cancer risk with GLP-1RAs,“ he told us. “It helps fill a critical gap for clinicians, regulators, and patients who must balance substantial metabolic and cardiovascular benefits against theoretical long-term cancer risks.”

At the study's conclusion, researchers determined that GLP-1 drugs probably had little to no impact on the risk for thyroid, pancreatic, breast, or kidney cancers. 

“The significance of this finding is that it directly addresses several long-standing safety concerns,” Chiang said. 

“For example, thyroid cancer and pancreatic cancer have been mentioned prior as potential areas of risk for GLP-1 receptor agonists. However, much of that concern came from small signals, preclinical studies, or observational data that were prone to confounding,” he noted. 

“At the same time, it is important to emphasize that trial follow-up is still relatively short for cancers that develop over many years,” Chiang continued.

 “Our results suggest that current GLP-1RA use does not appear to meaningfully increase short- to intermediate-term risk, but they do not rule out the possibility of effects, harmful or beneficial, over longer durations. Continued long-term surveillance will be essential.”

Chiang and his team also concluded that the evidence was of low certainty for colorectal, esophageal, and liver cancers risk, and that the impact of GLP-1 drugs on gastric cancer risk was very uncertain. 

“The significance of these findings is that they highlight areas where current evidence is simply too limited to draw firm conclusions, even across large randomized trials,” Chiang explained. “For colorectal, esophageal, liver, and gastric cancer, the number of events in trials was very small, and follow-up durations were relatively short.” 

As this study shows that GLP-1 medications probably have little or no effect on obesity-related cancer risk, MNT asked Chiang if it is possible that these drugs may offer a protective effect against these cancers. 

“Based on our analysis of randomized trials, GLP-1 medications probably have little or no effect on obesity-related cancer risk within the follow-up periods studied,” he responded. “However, this does not rule out the possibility of a protective effect over longer durations. In fact, there are several reasons why a protective effect has been hypothesized.” 

“First, obesity is a major driver of several cancers through chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and hormonal and metabolic pathways,” Chiang detailed. 

“GLP-1 receptor agonists produce substantial weight loss and improve metabolic health, which could theoretically reduce the incidence of obesity-related cancers over time. Second, several recent observational studies have reported lower rates of certain cancers among GLP-1RA users,” he explained.

“Because randomized trials to date have relatively short follow-up and few cancer events, they may not yet capture long-term or delayed protective effects,” Chiang continued. 

“From the perspective of current evidence, our study suggests that a clear protective effect has not yet been demonstrated in randomized data, but the possibility remains biologically plausible and supported by some real-world signals,” said the researcher.

MNT had the opportunity to speak with Anton Bilchik, MD, PhD, surgical oncologist, chief of medicine, and director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Providence Saint John's Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA, about this study.

His first reaction to the findings is that it needs a longer follow-up to come to the conclusion that GLP-1 drugs do not reduce the chances of getting obesity-related cancers, as the follow-up was only 1 to 2 years. 

“The other issue with the study is that cancer was not a primary endpoint of the trials that they looked at […] so that in itself is certainly an issue in how this data is interpreted,” Bilchik continued.

“And finally, which I think is most important and a lot more research has to be done, is we do not know how long the people in these trials have been obese for. Suggesting that obesity-related cancers may start occurring earlier on, and then patients get these GLP-1 drugs that reduce weight, at which point the cancer cells have already started forming,” he told us.

“The GLP-1 drugs are truly the most exciting type of medication that has been approved in the last few years, given the massive epidemic of obesity and the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular disease … and other conditions such as cancer,” he added. 

“Given the fact that we have this very effective way of treating what is an epidemic in this country, […] we need to know every possible aspect about these drugs, both the good and the bad,” noted Bilchik. 

MNT also spoke with Mir Ali, MD, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon, and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this research. 

“As these [GLP-1] drugs are widely prescribed and there are still limitations on insurance coverage, finding more effects of these medications and long-term benefits may help make these drugs available to more people,” Ali commented. 

“I would like to see if the degree of weight loss and the amount of time the weight is kept off affects cancer risk in obesity related cancers,” he told us.

It is generally accepted that patients who experience a first episode of unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) — meaning without reversible risk factors — should receive prolonged oral anticoagulation (OAC). However, treatment carries a risk for major bleeding and death, with the risk for death after a major bleeding event estimated to be two to three times higher than the risk for death after recurrent VTE.As a result, determining the ideal duration of anticoagulant treatment after a first unprovoked VTE event remains a challenge. A recent study compared the effects of continuing or stopping OAC treatment on clinical outcomes in patients with unprovoked VTE following an initial treatment period of at least 90 days.

The study included adults diagnosed with VTE who started OAC treatment — either warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) — within 30 days of first hospital admission for unprovoked VTE without reversible risk factors. All participants received at least 90 days of treatment.

The cohort was matched 1:1 by propensity score, creating 30,554 matched pairs of patients who continued or stopped OAC treatment (mean age, 74 years; 57% women). After the initial OAC treatment period of at least 90 days, patients who stopped treatment had significantly lower rates of recurrent VTE, higher rates of major bleeding, lower mortality, and a greater net clinical benefit. The greater net clinical benefit was observed across all types of OACs and all treatment durations.

The study concluded that continuing OAC therapy for at least 90 days was associated with a lower risk of recurrent VTE but a higher risk of major bleeding. Notably, the net clinical benefit persisted for patients who continued OAC for at least 3 years after the initial VTE event.

The study offers important insights into the efficacy, safety, and net benefit of long-term OAC treatment for patients with unprovoked VTE. An accompanying editorial points to ongoing uncertainties about how to identify patients with different risk profiles for bleeding and thromboembolic events. Such information would be invaluable for personalizing treatment plans. Based on the study findings, the editorialists suggest several practical recommendations:
