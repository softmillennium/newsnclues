                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Zachary Hart (Slow Horses) has been cast as a series regular in Netflix's Assassin's Creed. He joins previously cast leads Toby Wallace and Lola Petticrew in the live-action series based on Ubisoft's best-selling video game franchise. Assassin's Creed is a high-octane thriller centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions — one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny. Breaking Baz: Brazilian Cinematographer Adolpho Veloso On The Visual Poetry He Created For Awards Season Contender 'Train Dreams' Drew Goddard, Sarah Esberg Board Netflix's Joshua Zetumer Supernatural Drama Series 'Pagans' As EPs Details about Hart's role are being kept under wraps. Roberto Patino and David Wiener serve as showrunners on Assassin's Creed, which stems from a deal Netflix signed with Ubisoft in 2020. They executive produce with Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, Genevieve Jones for Ubisoft Film & Television, and Matt O'Toole. With more than 230 million units sold, the Assassin's Creed franchise is one of the best-selling series in video game history. Hart is a British actor-musician who most recently starred as Reg in the West End production of the Tony-winning Stereophonic. On TV, Hart has guest starred on such series as Apple TV's Slow Horses and Masters of the Air, Netflix's The Witcher: Blood Origin and Bodies, BBC's Peaky Blinders and ITV's Doc Martin. He is currently filming Season 2 of Netflix's spy action thriller Black Doves and can next be seen in Hugo Blick's California Avenue for the BBC, alongside Bill Nighy and Helena Bonham-Carter, and Channel 4's Big Mood, opposite Nicola Coughlan. Hart, who recently debuted his short film Chimera at the BFI London Film Festival, is repped by Insight Management & Production. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AMC is developing a small-screen series based on the 1991 film that starred Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves, Lori Petty and Gary Busey. The series comes from David Kalstein, who recently worked on Amazon's Butterfly; Alcon Television Group; and AMC Studios. Jane Fonda Spoofs Nicole Kidman's AMC Ad In The Wake Of WBD Merger News: "Somehow Corporate Greed Feels Good In A Place Like This" AMC Ripped Me Off Over 'Fear The Walking Dead' Profits, Zombie Series Co-Creator Dave Erickson Claims & He's Looking For Payback The original movie, which was directed by Kathryn Bigelow and written by W. Peter Iliff, starred Reeves as rookie FBI agent Johnny Utah, who infiltrates the Ex-Presidents, a gang of Southern California surfers who rob banks. The Ex-Presidents, who wear masks of Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Lyndon B. Johnson and Lyndon Johnson, are led by Swayze's Bodhi, and Utah gets swept up in their daredevil lifestyle before a massive action chase and a reunion amid lethal waves. Kalstein was a co-exec producer on Amazon's Butterfly, which starred Daniel Dae Kim. He also co-exec produced series including CBS' NCIS: Los Angeles, ABC's Quantico and USA Network's Treadstone, co-showrunning the latter. Point Break landed a remake in 2015 from director Ericson Core that starred Edgar Ramirez, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Delroy Lindo and Ray Winstone. It was produced by Alcon's Kosove and Johnson. The series is set to air its third season next year and Mayfair Witches, which is also based in Rice's Immortal Universe, has also been renewed for a third season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nicki Minaj definitely has a problem with California Governor Gavin Newsom, whose recent comments about transgender children incited a storm of diss posts on X about him from the rapper — but he seems to have clapped back by invoking the words of Megan Thee Stallion. It all started with the politician's Dec. 10 appearance on The Ezra Klein Show, where Newsom said that he wants “to see trans kids,” adding, “There's no governor that signed more pro-trans legislation than I have, and no one's been a stronger advocate for the LGBTQ [community].” Unimpressed by the prospective 2028 presidential candidate's remarks, Minaj unleashed a storm of posts antagonizing him on Friday (Dec. 12). “Imagine being the guy running on wanting to see trans kids,” she wrote. Normal adults wake up & think they want to see HEALTHY, SAFE, HAPPY kids.” Newsom — who has a trans godson — hasn't directly responded to the callouts, but he did post a video that many onlookers have interpreted as shade against Minaj. Captioned with only a mouth-zipped emoji, the montage compiles clips of Newsom and President Donald Trump — for whom Minaj has been showing more and more support online in recent weeks — set to Megan Thee Stallion's Billboard Hot 100-topper “Hiss.” The 2024 track is largely considered a diss track against Minaj, who certainly took offense to lyrics such as “These h–s don't be mad at Megan/ These h–s mad at Megan's Law” when Meg first dropped it. That same lyric plays over a photo of Trump standing next to Jeffrey Epstein — who pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution and soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008, and was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019 — in Newsom's video, which also includes newly released pictures of the president from Epstein's estate. Minaj appeared to respond to Newsom's video by posting shortly afterward, “Oh gavvy Pooh the ppl behind you clearly don't care about you” and “Pooh this won't get the results you guys are hoping for … I can go 8 stages deeper.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HYBE is making a bold move into Africa's booming music market through a global management partnership with industry veterans Brandon Hixon and Colin Gayle, the Korean company announced Monday. Hixon and Gayle bring decades of experience championing African music globally, and their alliance with HYBE signals a new era of Black-led creative leadership joining forces with a global entertainment powerhouse. The partnership will deliver expanded resources in touring, marketing, digital strategy, multimedia production and brand partnerships, while enabling cross-artist collaborations within HYBE's roster. The alliance will provide expanded support across touring, marketing, digital strategy, production and branding deals, while also opening the door to collaborations with artists across HYBE's global roster. “HYBE brings a global perspective that complements how Colin and I build. Together, we can help artists move freely and tell their stories on the biggest stages.” “We're entering a moment where African artists have unlimited potential,” added Gayle. “With HYBE's collaborative support, we can help them expand their reach while staying true to the roots that make this music extraordinary.” IFPI's 2025 Global Music Report underscores this momentum: Sub-Saharan Africa posted a 22.6% revenue increase last year, surpassing $100 million, while North Africa contributed to MENA's 22.8% growth. “We are thrilled to partner with cultural architects like Brandon Hixon and Colin Gayle, whose vision is essential to driving the powerful momentum of African artistry onto the global stage,” said Jason Jaesang Lee, CEO of HYBE. “This partnership represents a pivotal moment in HYBE's global expansion strategy. By combining their expertise with our global network and resources, we will establish a strategic, sustainable bridge designed to amplify authentic African voices and artistry to fans across the world.” In November, HYBE reported Q3 revenue up 38% year-over-year to 727.2 billion Korean won ($519 million), powered by concert income from BTS' Jin, SEVENTEEN and TXT.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Co-written by the younger Reiner, 'Being Charlie' premiered at TIFF in 2015. It serves as an unexpected map of the Reiners' dynamic. Nick Reiner has been arrested in connection with the homicide investigation into the deaths of his parents, Rob and Michele Reiner. The younger Reiner had long struggled with addiction. Nick co-wrote the script with a friend from rehab, inspired by their experiences, while Rob directed the movie, drawing off what he went through as a father. Two People Found Dead at Rob Reiner's House in Los Angeles; LAPD Investigating "Apparent Homicide" Premiering at TIFF in September 2015 ahead of a release the next year on Starz, Charlie centers on Charlie Mills, the 18-year-old addict son of David , a movie star who is now running for Congress. Charlie resents the harsh way his father and mother are treating his addiction, which involves mandatory stints in rehab; that tracks closely with how Rob, Michele and Nick Reiner interacted, the family said. And it ends with at best a détente after an apology from the dad for the sometimes-unsympathetic way he treated his son — an apology Reiner said in an interview at TIFF that he owed and gave to his son in real life. We were desperate and because the people had diplomas on their wall, we listened to them when we should have been listening to our son,” the Princess Bride director told the L.A. Times at a dinner with his family, including Nick, who by then achieved sobriety. Michele added: “We were so influenced by these people. Nick, who didn't say much at the dinner, did note that he decided to get clean because “I got sick of it. I'm not supposed to be out there on the streets and in homeless shelters doing all these fucked-up things.” (The Hollywood Reporter's review said the pair “clearly used this as a way to work through how 22-year-old Nick Reiner's own drug problems affected their family.”) In a post-screening Q&A, Rob said that “we didn't set out for it to be cathartic or for it to be therapeutic, but it turned out to be that,” when asked by a festgoer about their relationship. A moment later Rob said “there were disagreements” and “at times it was really rough” when the pair were trying to figure out how to depict the reality of their relationship in the movie. Nick said, “Sometimes it would get overwhelming for me.” The movie is on YouTube, and late Sunday night it had become a go-to space for people to come and debate how parents relate to their drug-addicted kids, with viewers alternately expressing sympathy for the father and the son. A film scene in which Charlie angrily confronts his father at his family home is painful to watch, and if law enforcement concludes Nick is the suspect, it would not be surprising if YouTube decided to remove the film. Still, Nick did not seem as engaged with the interview as one might have expected; at one point he said, “I really wasn't sure I wanted to do this.” A reporter came away feeling that the elder Reiner's expression of closure was an aspiration that had not been fully achieved. (THR's review concluded that the film featured “two warring agendas, aligned neatly with the father and son positions expressed therein. The dad viewpoint, on the other hand, is all about seeking closure, making everything all better and moving on to some elusive next stage where life can resume as normal once a handily cathartic rock-bottom has been endured. But the two angles are not so easily reconciled by final-reel hugs and glib one-liners.”) David: “Charlie, I know you're angry at me and probably don't want to hear this right now but I do love you. Every expert with a desk and a diploma told me I had to be tough at you but every time we sent you away to another one of those programs I saw you slipping away from us. And all I could tell myself is that I'd rather have you alive and hating me than dead on the streets. All I ever wanted was a way to kill the noise.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bail has been set at $4 million after Nick Reiner was taken into custody by the Los Angeles Police Department after the Hollywood director and his wife Michele were found dead in their home on Sunday. His charge level is listed as felony, with bail set at $4 million. Iconic filmmaker Rob Reiner, 78, and wife Michele, 70, were found dead in their L.A. home on Chadbourne Avenue reportedly stabbed to death. The couple suffered “lacerations consistent with a knife,” law enforcement sources told TMZ. Billy Crystal Seen Outside Rob Reiner's House Wiping Away Tears Following Director's Death Said a spokesperson for the family on Sunday night: “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. The Reiners' son Nick was early on reported as a suspect. He battled drug addiction and homelessness, had more than a dozen stints in rehab, and co-wrote a film loosely based on his life, Being Charlie (2015), that was directed by his father.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rob Reiner‘s expansive legacy didn't end with his vast contributions to film and television. The acclaimed actor and director, who was found dead alongside his wife, Michele, at their California home Sunday night, was also outspoken in his championing of civil rights. “Rob's achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen,” former president Barack Obama shared in a statement on X. “But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people — and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action. Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi wrote, “Personally, Rob cared deeply about people and demonstrated that in his civic activities — whether by supporting the First 5 initiative or fighting against Prop 8 in California. Reiner's political perspective shaped an array of releases throughout his career as he encouraged audiences to dig deeper into the politics and politicians shaping America. In 2017, he released Shock and Awe, a film critical of the George W. Bush administration. It arrived just a year after he chronicled the start of Lyndon B. Johnson's presidency as successor to John F. Kennedy in 2016's LBJ. The political thread that runs throughout his filmography can be traced back to his role as Michael “Meathead” Stivic in All in the Family, as well. “Rob Reiner's work has impacted generations of Americans,” former vice president Kamala Harris wrote on X. And what we're seeing now is the weaponization of that racism.… These people [Christian nationalists] are fine with the idea that America should be a white, Christian nation. They're frightened of what's happening in this country with diversity. “Millions of people died so that fascism wouldn't come to our shores, so that we'd preserve our democracy, and 80 years later, we're faced with a possible fascist takeover,” he told Rolling Stone in May. “An acclaimed actor, director, producer, writer, and engaged political activist, he always used his gifts in service of others.” Barack Obama Offers Marc Maron Political and Professional Advice on ‘WTF' Finale Rob Reiner Says Trump Federalizing National Guard, ICE Raids Are ‘Beyond McCarthy Era-esque' California Governor Gavin Newsom echoed these sentiments in his statement. His boundless empathy made his stories timeless, teaching generations how to see goodness and righteousness in others — and encouraging us to dream bigger.” Trump Mocks Rob Reiner, Says He Was Killed Because of His ‘TDS' And they were good, generous people who made everyone who knew them better through their active citizenship in defense of inclusive democracy, setting an example for us all to follow. Senator Elizabeth Warren shared a photo with Reiner on X with the caption, “I was devastated to hear about the loss of Rob Reiner and Michele Singer. We live in a better country because of them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australian actress Rachael Carpani, best known for her role on “McLeod's Daughters,” has died at the age of 45. Her family confirmed the news in a statement shared on social media, describing her passing as peaceful following a long illness. On Monday, December 15, Rachael's sister, Georgia, shared a statement from their parents, Tony and Gael Carpani, on Instagram announcing her death. “It is with great sadness that Tony and Gael Carpani announce that their beautiful daughter, beloved Australian actress Rachael Carpani, unexpectedly but peacefully passed away after a long battle with chronic illness, in the early hours of Sunday, December 7,” the statement read. The family also shared funeral details, noting, “The funeral will be a private event, to be held on Friday, December 19, with close family and friends.” The post concluded with a request for privacy, adding, “The family requests privacy at this very difficult time and will be making no further statements.” The role made her a familiar and beloved figure to audiences. She later expanded her career internationally, appearing in U.S. television series and films. She also starred in Lifetime's “Against the Wall” and appeared in the 2009 film “Triangle” alongside Liam Hemsworth, according to IMDb. In August, Georgia paid a heartfelt tribute to Rachael on her birthday, sharing photos and a loving message that has since taken on deeper meaning. “Whether she's done up and going out or staying in and working, she's the most beautiful woman I know,” Georgia wrote. “I am so incredibly saddened to learn of your darling sister's passing. I grew up watching & wanting to be her. Sending much love and enveloping hugs to your family. Rachael Carpani is remembered for her memorable performances and the warmth her family, friends, and fans say she brought into their lives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That is, hack away as much of the inedible and unpalatable connective tissue as you can in the hopes of finding something flavorful and nourishing underneath. Because, make no mistake about it, this finale is one of the more ungainly “I told you that story so I could tell you this story, probably some time in Q4 2027” episodes of TV I've encountered in a good long time. (And that's from both directions, actually, courtesy of a post-ending sequence that jumps forward to 1988 in a bald effort to justify this season's Mrs. Kersh plotline, while also working in a quick Sophia Lillis cameo.) Lillis' appearance dovetails nicely with the flash of Finn Wolfhard we got a bit earlier in the finale, when poor Pennywise The Dancing Clown is forced to lay epic amounts of track for potential prequel/sequel purposes when he reveals that his current opponent Margie Truman will eventually get married and give birth to IT's co-killer, Richie Tozier. Margie and Lilly later saying this nice and slow, so everybody in the back can get it, means that this show can now justify launching a pre-prequel for itself by following the creature's attempts to wipe out the bloodlines that lead to its downfall through time. The important thing is that the show's apparently inevitable next season has now been “narratively justified,” and it only took grinding this one to a halt to get it done. If there's an elegant way to impart this information, Jason Fuchs' script and Andy Muschietti's camera never find it—but that's not a problem unique to those parts of “Winter Fire” dedicated to the show's wider franchise duties. The sudden revelation that our old friend the Magic Dagger starts acting like the One Ring if it gets moved even a couple of miles away from where it landed in Derry—because that's its “home,” duh—at least has a bracing amount of narrative utility, allowing Fuchs to resolve Ronnie and Lilly's lingering conflict, layer in some last-second “power of friendship” material for the group, and pace out the final confrontation to be one of the slowest-moving cliffhangers I've ever seen, all with a single plot point. Besides forcing Guerrero to deliver some lines that are just absolute video game fetch quest nonsense (“The earth is a conductor,” she intones with a matter-of-fact gravity I've come to think of in these pages as “Remar-esque”), there's a bigger problem that this hefty bit of last-second construction imposes: Making the end of this conflict so concrete highlights how fast and loose the show has played with IT's physical capabilities, which allow it to blanket all of Derry in icy fog at the start of the episode but then slow it to the speed of plot once the creature's making its escape. To be clear, I'm not arguing that IT should have rules; its chimeric, unknowable nature is a huge part of what makes it scary. But by giving itself a very deliberate ticking clock for the creature to race against, “Winter Fire” invites these comparisons onto itself, creating situations where it makes what should be the show's single most valuable asset—one of the scariest creations of one of America's scariest brains, a monster designed to tap into our most primal fears, and one that had me, personally, scared shitless to reach my hand out into a darkened basement to feel for a light switch as a teenager for years—look either weak, foolish, or both. Tabletop game designers constantly caution dungeon masters not to stat out monsters and gods they don't want to see killed or humbled by ambitious players; this finale is an able demonstration of why. Luckily, it's also a demonstration of some notable elements of Welcome To Derry's better nature, even if, as predicted, the show never finds a message more interesting and meaningful to cling to than “Friends and family: good! The military murdering people to impose fear on Americans: bad!” (R.I.P. When Muschietti isn't giving into his gorier impulses or trying to find more places to jam teeth into Bill Skarsgård's face, he's capable of a subtly horrifying visual here or there. It's in its character work, though—always this show's strongest element—that “Winter Fire” achieves some measure of saving grace. Whether watching Jovan Adepo's Leroy talk Chis Chalk's Hallorann out of suicide, or seeing Clara Stack and Amanda Christine sink their teeth into Lilly and Ronnie's frustrations with both themselves, and each other, this episode gets closest to thriving when it focuses on people, not plot. I can hold on to those highs, almost all emotional in nature, while contemplating this finale—as long as I don't start actually, y'know, thinking. Because that's when my brain starts complaining about how little almost anything IT does in this episode makes sense. Or the way Hallorann asks “How much trouble could a hotel be?” while the show takes a little bow at how goddamn clever it's being with its Shining references. (Y'know, the ones where the grandson they've doomed to live in this hell town is getting constantly threatened by a murder clown with absolutely zero oversight?) But they add up to an episode of TV that works intermittently in the heart but almost never in the head. And that's Welcome To Derry in a nutshell, really. It's a series you can either appreciate on a strict gut level of spectacle—although I'd argue that it's one of the least actually scary horror shows I've ever seen—or as a showcase of craft and performance. But as a cohesive story, it never came together, failing to grab hold of any major themes or ideas (beyond “murder clown scary,” I guess) or build anything satisfying beyond a handful of core character arcs. I come away from it unconvinced that Muschietti actually knows what was horrifying about Stephen King's book, or even what could have been scary about this era of American history. A crew of talented performers, and some genuinely stomach-turning effects shots, have worked overtime to give the series an energy it otherwise might have failed to possess. (I can still get a latent thrill from that opening car ride in the pilot, or Ronnie's nightmare sequence in episode two, sequences that merged the visceral with the real in a way that mined both for genuine fear.) But a lot of that spark, if I'm being honest, seemed to desert the series once it had Skarsgård to fall back on for a more rote, if charismatic, flavor of menace. And if this is all Muschietti and his fellow writers and directors could think to do with this fantastic creation, in this rich an era of American history, then my vote is obvious after eight episodes of disappointed hopes: Down, I say, with the clown.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rob Reiner, the legendary director and actor who rose to prominence in All in the Family and went on to direct the classic film comedies This Is Spinal Tap, The Princess Bride and When Harry Met Sally…, died in his California home with his wife, Michele Singer, on Sunday. “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner,” his family said in a statement. Police are treating the deaths as apparent homicides. As of Sunday night, the LAPD have not officially identified a suspect, but Rolling Stone has confirmed that Reiner's son, Nick, was involved in the homicide. A source confirmed to Rolling Stone that the couple's daughter, Romy, found her parents' bodies. Paramedics had been called to the home at around 3:30 p.m. and officers were dispatched after firefighters discovered a death. “An acclaimed actor, director, producer, writer, and engaged political activist, he always used his gifts in service of others.” “I didn't take any money from him,” he recalled in 2016. With his 1984 debut This Is Spinal Tap, a mockumentary about a notoriously terrible U.K. metal band, Reiner worked with his stars and co-writers Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer to craft a heavily improvised film that made fun of rock-star egos and artistic pretensions. They looked down on the lowly peasants of TV. But it wasn't until such sitcom alums as Ron Howard, Danny DeVito, Penny Marshall, and I, along with the TV writers Barry Levinson and Jim Brooks, were successfully directing movies in the Eighties that these dividing lines were erased.” Abraham Quintanilla Jr., Selena's Father and Manager, Dead at 86 Joseph Byrd, Who Led Pioneering Psych Rock Band the United States of America, Dead at 87 Peter Greene, 'Pulp Fiction' and 'The Mask' Actor, Dead at 60 Sophie Kinsella, Author of the ‘Shopaholic' Book Series, Dead at 55 He followed This Is Spinal Tap with the 1985 romantic comedy The Sure Thing, starring relative unknown John Cusack, but his next five films were indelible. Adapting Stephen King's novella The Body into Stand by Me, Reiner demonstrated his ability to elicit wonderfully lived-in performances from his young cast, which included Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell. The next year, he tackled another adaptation, William Goldman's fantasy book The Princess Bride, and showed he was just as capable at crafting a tender, funny fairy tale. As with his previous movies, The Princess Bride wasn't simply popular but proved to be a warehouse for endlessly quotable lines: “Have fun storming the castle!” “Inconceivable!” These early hits catered to all ages, but with his 1989 film, When Harry Met Sally…, he produced one of the period's wisest, most grown-up romantic comedies. Working from Nora Ephron's flawless script, Reiner told the story of two platonic friends, Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan), who eventually discover that they love each other. When Harry Met Sally… took the urban sophistication of Woody Allen's best New York love stories and married it to contemporary concerns about relationships and, of course, faking orgasms. (The movie's famous scene with Ryan faking it in a restaurant was capped with Reiner's own mother Estelle saying the key line: “I'll have what she's having.”) Reiner didn't just master comedies: His 1990 adaptation of King's bestselling novel Misery won Kathy Bates an Oscar for terrorizing James Caan's poor novelist Paul Sheldon. Although darkly funny, Misery was also legitimately scary, further illustrating Reiner's ability to produce excellent mainstream Hollywood entertainment across genres. That roll continued with 1992's A Few Good Men, with Aaron Sorkin adapting his own play for a live-wire courtroom drama highlighted by terrific performances from, among others, Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson, whose momentous “You can't handle the truth!” showdown was just one more example of Reiner conjuring up instant-classic moments in his box-office hits. In the midst of this incredible run, he was unfailingly modest about his talents. I'm not great at any of these things, but as a director I have the opportunity to utilize all these things in one job. … I pick people who are creative and gentle and are willing to struggle along with me a little bit if I'm not exactly sure. But if his career never contained another movie that captured the public's imagination, he continued to make films on myriad topics, focusing chiefly on political issues he cared about. An outspoken liberal who criticized George W. Bush and Donald Trump, he turned that anger at the country's right-ward direction into pictures such as LBJ and Shock and Awe, which were provocations meant to inspire everyday Americans to look more closely at their government. Reiner appeared in movies like 1987's Throw Momma From the Train and 1993's Sleepless in Seattle, and he was delightful in 2013's The Wolf of Wall Street playing the father of Leonardo DiCaprio's unscrupulous stockbroker ​​Jordan Belfort. And he enjoyed spoofing his own leftie image, playing himself as Rep. Rob Reiner in a memorable episode of 30 Rock. Most recently, he made his first sequel, directing Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, which arrived in theaters in September. He reunited with Shearer, McKean, and Guest, reprising his role as clueless documentarian Marty DiBergi. Reiner and his stars had long resisted the temptation to make a Part Two. “We never even considered it,” he wrote in A Fine Line Between Stupid and Clever. Despite the wealth of enduring favorites Reiner directed, he was only nominated for one Oscar (Best Picture for A Few Good Men). But the endless rewatchability of his best movies speaks to what he achieved as a mainstream filmmaker, blending craft, smarts, heart, and humor in a way few directors managed. Trump Mocks Rob Reiner, Says He Was Killed Because of His ‘TDS' Rob Reiner's Son Arrested After Allegedly Killing Parents Asked what makes a “Rob Reiner film” by 60 Minutes in 1994, Reiner explained that it was hard to categorize given his range of films, but “the main character in the film is always going through something that I've experienced or am experiencing, and I try to make it as personal as possible,” he said. “It's the only way I know how to tell a story,” he continued.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Actress and former ‘Dancing with the Stars' contestant Mira Sorvino is honoring the late director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, in a beautiful statement posted online. The couple tragically passed away in their Los Angeles home on Sunday, December 14. His wife Michele was a lovely generous person- I wish I had been able to get to know her better.” He was so funny and intelligent – we had a great time shooting what could have been awkward scenes but his wit and warmth made all that go away. Talking with him on and off the set was a joy. Sorvino and Reiner co-starred in Ryan Murphy's 2020 Netflix limited series “Hollywood,” a reimagining of Tinseltown. “I wanted to do something where I gave some, if not all of these people a happy ending,” Murphy told TIME. “How do I make a commentary on the power of Hollywood to change hearts and minds? I decided to put together a fictional alternative-universe Hollywood and then populated it with some real people, and other fictional characters loosely based on real people.” Sorvino won the Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Woody Allen's “Mighty Aphrodite” (1995). She is also known for her roles in 1997's cult classic “Romy and Michele's High School Reunion,” where she starred opposite Lisa Kudrow. She has also been in genre films like “Mimic,” and television roles like “Norma Jean & Marilyn,” which earned her a Primetime Emmy Nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress and a Golden Globe Nomination for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film. While on the show, she gave fans a throwback to “Romy and Michele's High School Reunion” when she performed a contemporary style dance to “Time After Time” by Cyndi Lauper.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were stabbed to death in their LA home on Sunday and their son is a person of interest, law enforcement sources told The Post. Officers were called to the home Sunday afternoon, where they discovered a man and woman with stab wounds, cops and sources told the outlet. The Los Angeles Fire Department told local outlet NBC Los Angeles that a 78-year-old man and a 68-year-old woman were found dead inside the home, which match the ages of Rob and Michele. A spokesperson for LAPD told The Post that detectives from LAPD's Robbery-Homicide Division were also at the scene. Start your day with Page Six Daily.

Shortly after, officers with the LAPD responded to the home following reports of an “ambulance death investigation,” which is when officers are called by firefighters to the discovery of a death. “This is a devastating loss for our city and our country,” LA Mayor Karen Bass said Sunday night. “Personally, I am heartbroken by the tragic loss of Rob and his wife Michele. I knew Rob and have tremendous respect for him. Among his numerous contributions, Rob helped create First 5 California, a landmark initiative funded by a tobacco tax to support early childhood development programs. They were true champions for LGBTQ+ rights,” Bass added. People magazine reported Sunday that their daughter Romy found them. The couple, who were last seen together in April, wed in 1989 and share three children: Jake, Nick and Romy. Reiner also shares an adopted daughter with his late ex-wife, Penny Marshall. Their son Nick has been open about his issues battling drug addiction and homelessness in the past. Reiner rose to fame in the 1970s for his Emmy-winning portrayal of Michael “Meathead” Stivic, Archie Bunker's son-in-law, in American classic TV show “All in the Family.” Reiner directed beloved and classic films including “The Princess Bride,” “Stand By Me,” “Misery” and “Spinal Tap.”</p>

Songz and his friends were partying at Dramma Night Club in Times Square on Dec. 4 and allegedly “became needlessly irate” when a worker told him the club was closing around 4 a.m., prosecutors said in Manhattan criminal court, according to The Post. Songz appeared in court Sunday as he was arraigned on an assault charge for the alleged club brawl and an additional charge of mischief in the second degree from an unrelated incident that took place Sunday morning at Mira, a restaurant and hookah lounge in Manhattan. During the Sunday incident, Songz allegedly broke around $1,500 worth of restaurant property, including hookahs, DJ equipment and sofas, according the complaint against him. The employee from Dramma was granted an order of protection against Songz, who is a regular at the nightclub, according to prosecutors. The songwriter, born Tremaine Neverson, left court wearing a hood covering his face and declined to comment. In a statement from Songz's counsel, Page Six is told that the singer “was charged in connection with an incident that occurred last week. “Separately, last night Trey was confronted by individuals who instigated a confrontation and attempted to surround him. “Public figures are often treated as targets for instigation in pursuit of headlines or financial gain. We are confident the facts will speak for themselves.” In 2016, the “Na Na” hitmaker was arrested and charged with assault after an onstage meltdown in which he threw microphones and speakers from the stage of his Detroit concert. In 2018, a woman accused Songz of striking her in the face during an NBA All-Star event and obtained a restraining order against him.

After being released from jail, the “Bottoms Up” crooner poked fun at the incident, posting a series of photos on a private jet to social media and quipped, “Chiefs game was lit right? That same year, he was subject to a sexual assault investigation after former Las Vegas basketball player Dylan Gonzalez accused the singer of raping her. In the latest lawsuit against him, the musician was sued for sexual assault after a woman alleged he groped her breasts during an incident in 2013. In documents obtained by Page Six, Jane Doe claimed that Songz “came up behind” her, and she was “shocked” to see that he allegedly “ripped back her bathing suit top, grabbed her breasts, and exposed them” to those inside of the tent, per the lawsuit.</p>
