                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Los Angeles police swiftly enforced a downtown curfew Tuesday night, making arrests moments after it took effect, while deploying officers on horseback and using crowd control projectiles to break up a group of hundreds demonstrating against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Bass was joined by mayors from across the region, several of whom said they were immigrants. Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman also said about 500 of the National Guard troops have been trained so far to accompany agents on immigration operations. Photos of guard members providing security for the agents have already been circulated by immigration officials. Sherman is commander of Task Force 51, which is overseeing the more than 4,000 Guard troops and 700 Marines who have been deployed to Los Angeles to provide security during the protests. Some of those arrested in connection with downtown protests during rush hour Tuesday were charged for vandalism, police say. Four people face felony charges, including for aggravated battery against an officer of the peace. Chicago leaders say the majority of protesters were peaceful and exercising their First Amendment rights. Speaking at a bill-signing news conference Wednesday, Republican Gov. He added only that they will be in “strategic locations where they can provide the most robust response” if needed. “There are others outside of this room who would like to know that. And I'm not going to tell them,” Abbott said. San Antonio officials have said they didn't ask for the Guard to be sent. The mayor said an overnight curfew for downtown neighborhoods will remain in effect indefinitely. Bass said officials will consider lifting it if there are fewer arrests Wednesday night. “What I'm hoping is that Angelenos got the message last night,” she said. “If there are raids that continue, if there are soldiers marching up and down our streets, I would imagine that the curfew will continue,” she said. Demonstrators protest ongoing raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, Tuesday, June 10, 2025, in Washington. People hold a vigil at Fruitvale Station in Oakland, Calif. to show solidarity with demonstrations against ICE raids, on Tuesday, June 10, 2025. NYPD officers carry a detained demonstrator during a protest against deportation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement outside Jacob K. Javits Federal Building in New York, Monday, June 9, 2025. “Maybe we are part of a national experiment about how far to determine the federal government can go in reaching in and taking over power from a governor, power from a local jurisdiction,” Bass said. Mayor Karen Bass speaks at a vigil by community religious leaders on Tuesday, June 10, 2025, in Los Angeles. Bass was joined by mayors from across the region, several of whom said they were immigrants. Many of the city leaders said raids have been happening outside Home Depots, churches and other businesses. The vast majority of people -- 203 -- were detained for failing to disperse Tuesday, and 17 others for violating the curfew that set in at 8 p.m. over part of Los Angeles, police said in a statement Wednesday. Police said they used “numerous” less lethal munitions to control the crowd. FILE - Houston Mayor John Whitmire looks on prior to a press conference outside of Acres Homes cooling center in Houston, Wednesday, July 10, 2024. At Wednesday's Houston City Council meeting, Mayor John Whitmire did not specifically mention the possibility of Texas National Guard troops being sent to the nation's fourth-largest city ahead of any protests. City leaders expressed their confidence in the Houston Police Department being able to monitor any protests. FILE - Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson takes his seat at the witness table during a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing with Sanctuary City Mayors on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, March 5, 2025, in Washington. The largest Chicago gathering was downtown Wednesday when thousands gathered in a downtown plaza and onto surrounding streets during the evening rush hour. “The vast majority of protesters remain peaceful and organized,” Johnson said. Both people are charged with possession of an unregistered destructive device, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said at a press conference Wednesday. Investigators are combing through FBI videos, body camera footage from law enforcement and other evidence on social media, said Essayli. Authorities expect to charge more people in the coming days and weeks. It used those cases to portray violent criminals as its primary targets and accuse political opponents of coddling them. “How much longer will Governor (Gavin) Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass continue to prioritize these criminal illegal aliens over their own citizens?” said Tricia McLaughlin, a department spokesperson. ICE will continue to enforce the law and arrest criminal illegal aliens.” Crowds of demonstrators rallying in solidarity with activists in Los Angeles took over a plaza and some surrounding streets amid rush hour traffic. Police said Wednesday that the injured woman fractured her left arm and was treated at a local hospital. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., left, hold a news conference on the GOP reconciliation bill, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, June 11, 2025. The defense of Newsom came as House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer were asked how Newsom should be dealing with Trump. Jeffries said Newsom “has been doing a tremendous job on behalf of the people of California.” He then used the question to state Democrats believe along with Newsom that anybody who commits violence or destroys property should be held accountable to the full extent of that law. At the same time, people have a right to “peacefully protest and petition their government.” Schumer said that Trump has been trying to intimidate Newsom. “All for him and proud that he is refusing to be intimidated by Donald Trump.” The protests took place around Foley Square Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning. Many in the large crowds, which police estimated at around 2,500 people, shouted out against federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement and waved signs that included “ICE out of NYC” as they rallied near an ICE facility and federal courthouses. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the vast majority of demonstrators were peaceful. She blamed smaller groups for causing the disorder that required police intervention. Police said they took 86 people into custody, including 52 who were released with criminal court summonses for minor crimes and 34 who were charged with assault, resisting arrest and other crimes. Some protesters clashed with police when they jumped over metal barricades and were wrestled to the ground by officers. Video also showed demonstrators throwing items at law enforcement vehicles.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull) About 700 Marines are still undergoing civil disturbance training at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach in Orange County, California, said Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, head of the task force that's overseeing the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles. Sherman wouldn't speculate about when the Marines might join the 2,000 or so Guard troops that have been deployed in downtown areas to protect federal buildings during sometimes violent demonstrations against President Trump's immigration crackdown. Another 2,000 Guard troops were expected to mobilize on Thursday, he said during a news conference. The streets of downtown Los Angeles began bustling with residents walking dogs and commuters clutching coffee cups after the overnight curfew was lifted at 6 a.m. Wednesday. Officials said at least two dozen people were arrested for violating the curfew, but overall they were fewer clashes between police and demonstrators than on previous nights. There were no signs of Marines deployed to downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday, joining the National Guard troops that are protecting federal buildings and ICE agents making arrests. “The president's decision to federalize and deploy California's National Guard without the consent of California state leaders is unlawful, unconstitutional, and undemocratic,” the attorneys general said in a statement released by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. In their capacity as the chief legal officers of the 18 states, they also expressed support for California Attorney General Rob Bonta's court challenge to Trump's order. “We oppose any action from this administration that will sow chaos, inflame tensions, and put people's lives at risk — including those of our law-enforcement officers,” they wrote. The hundreds who marched Tuesday evening down thoroughfares in the city, blocking traffic and chanting, were eventually told to disperse by police. Three people were arrested on assault charges, according to Denver police. Other charges included graffiti, unlawfully throwing projectiles and failing to following the police's orders. She rejected Noem's comments as “completely false” the day before, publishing a video of her in her morning press briefing calling for Mexicans to act in peace in the Los Angeles protests. Sheinbaum added more details Wednesday — claiming her opponents had “completely taken out of context” her previous comments suggesting that Mexicans could protest a tax on remittances proposed by Trump. “We have never called for a violent demonstration,” she said. Mayor Ron Nirenberg said city officials did not ask for the Texas National Guard to be deployed to the city ahead of planned protests Wednesday night and Saturday. Greg Abbott's office said Tuesday night that National Guard troops were “on standby” in areas where demonstrations are planned. San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said he has not been told by either the governor's office or the guard how many troops would be in the city, where they would be positioned or what they will be doing. The governor's office has not publicly released those details. “We are prepared for a peaceful demonstration, but we are also prepared if something goes south and it turns violent,” McManus said. Protesters gather to denounce ICE, U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement, operations Tuesday, June 10, 2025, in Los Angeles. In Orange County, a day laborer said he started carrying his green card everywhere. And during a news conference Monday, the family members of detained workers in Los Angeles urged officials to uphold the city and the state of California as places of sanctuary for immigrants. California National Guard are positioned at the Federal Building on Tuesday, June 10, 2025, in downtown Los Angeles. While many have been peaceful, some have resulted in clashes with law enforcement as officers made arrests and used chemical irritants to disperse crowds. Activists are planning more and even larger demonstrations in the coming days, with “No Kings” events across the country on Saturday to coincide with Trump's planned military parade through Washington. “ICE will continue to enforce the law,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted Tuesday on social media. New York City police detained more than 80 people during protests around lower Manhattan's Foley Square against federal immigration enforcement actions Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning. It's one of the most extreme emergency powers available to a U.S. president. “If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. Los Angeles police swiftly enforced a downtown curfew, making arrests moments after it took effect, while deploying officers on horseback and using crowd control projectiles to break up a group of hundreds of demonstrators. Members of the National Guard stood watch behind plastic shields, but did not appear to participate in the arrests Tuesday night. Hours later, many of the protesters had dispersed, although sporadic confrontations continued that were much smaller than in previous nights. Gavin Newsom asked a court to put an emergency stop to the military helping federal immigration agents, with some guardsmen now standing in protection around agents as they carried out arrests. He said it would only heighten tensions and promote civil unrest.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Los Angeles police swiftly enforced a downtown curfew Tuesday night, making arrests moments after it took effect, while deploying officers on horseback and using crowd control projectiles to break up a group of hundreds demonstrating against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Gavin Newsom said President Donald Trump is “pulling a military dragnet” across Los Angeles during a brief public address on Tuesday.

Protesters are detained by law enforcement near the federal building in downtown Los Angeles on Tuesday, June 10, 2025. LOS ANGELES (AP) — Police detained more than 20 people, mostly on curfew violations, on the first night of restrictions in downtown Los Angeles and used crowd-control projectiles to break up hundreds of protesters demonstrating against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, officials said Wednesday. But there were fewer clashes between police and demonstrators than on previous nights, and by daybreak, the downtown streets were bustling with residents walking dogs and commuters clutching coffee cups. Officials said the curfew was necessary to stop vandalism and theft by agitators after five days of protests, which have mostly been concentrated downtown. LA's nightly curfew, which the mayor said would remain in effect as long as necessary, covers a 1-square-mile (2.5-square-kilometer) section that includes an area where protests have occurred since Friday in the sprawling city of 4 million. “If there are raids that continue, if there are soldiers marching up and down our streets, I would imagine that the curfew will continue,” Mayor Karen Bass said. “We started off by hearing the administration wanted to go after violent felons, gang members, drug dealers,” she told a news conference. You're trying to cause fear and panic.” Referring to the protests, she added: “If you drive a few blocks outside of downtown, you don't know that anything is happening in the city at all.” Some 2,000 National Guard soldiers are in the city, and about half of them have been protecting federal buildings and agents, said Army Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, head of Task Force 51, which is overseeing the deployment of National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles. About 700 Marines will soon join the Guard troops, but they are still undergoing training and will not be mobilized Wednesday, Sherman said. Another 2,000 Guard troops should be on the streets by Thursday, he said. Gavin Newsom has accused Trump of drawing a “military dragnet” across the nation's second-largest city with his escalating use of the National Guard, which Trump activated, along with the Marines, over the objections of city and state leaders. The assistance includes some guardsmen now standing protectively around agents as they carry out arrests. The Guard has the authority to temporarily detain people who attack officers, but any arrests would be made by law enforcement. Meanwhile in New York City, police said they took 86 people into custody during protests in lower Manhattan that lasted into Wednesday morning. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the vast majority of demonstrators were peaceful. A 66-year-old woman in Chicago was injured when she was struck by a car during downtown protests Tuesday evening, police said. Greg Abbott's office said Texas National Guard troops were “on standby” in areas where demonstrations are planned. Guard members were sent to San Antonio, but Police Chief William McManus said he had not been told how many troops were deployed or their role ahead of planned protests Wednesday night and Saturday. Two people accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at police during the LA protests over the weekend face charges that could bring up to 10 years in prison, the Justice Department announced Wednesday. No one was injured by the devices. “We are looking at hundreds of people,” U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said. “If you took part in these riots and were looking to cause trouble, we will come looking for you.” Newsom called Trump's actions the start of an “assault” on democracy. “California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. The protests began Friday after federal immigration raids arrested dozens of workers in Los Angeles. Thousands of people have peacefully rallied outside City Hall and hundreds more protested outside a federal complex that includes a detention center where some immigrants are being held following workplace raids. Despite the protests, immigration enforcement activity has continued throughout the county, with city leaders and community groups reporting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement present at libraries, car washes and Home Depots. School graduations in Los Angeles have increased security over fears of ICE action, and some have offered parents the option to watch on Zoom. The majority of arrests since the protests began have been for failing to disperse, while a few others were for assault with a deadly weapon, looting and vandalism. At least seven police officers have been injured.</p>

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth opens up about the department's goals under President Donald Trump and the future of warfare on 'The Will Cain Show.' Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has authorized the voluntary departure of U.S. military dependents from locations across the Middle East, a major move as tensions spike across the region. A U.S. defense official told Fox News on Wednesday: "The safety and security of our service members and their families remains our highest priority and U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) is monitoring the developing tension in the Middle East. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has authorized the voluntary departure of military dependents from locations across the CENTCOM AOR." While the Department of Defense (DOD) has not cited a specific threat, the move comes as Iran-backed militias increase activity and regional instability grows. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized the voluntary departure of U.S. military dependents from across the Middle East. "CENTCOM is working in close coordination with our Department of State counterparts, as well as our Allies and partners in the region to maintain a constant state of readiness to support any number of missions around the world at any time," the official added. US FORCES TARGET HOUTHI WEAPONS STORAGE FACILITIES IN YEMEN OVER THE WEEKEND: CENTCOMWhile voluntary departures aren't rare, they typically kick in when a security environment worsens.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt condemned the protest and riots in Los Angeles as "shameful" on Wednesday, blasting California officials for failing to reign in "left-wing radicals." Leavitt made the comments as soon as she took the podium at a Wednesday press briefing. She emphasized President Donald Trump's efforts to quash the "mob rule" seen in the city while accusing California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of failing to serve their constituents. "They didn't have the courage to do the right thing and protect law-abiding Californians from rioters," Leavitt said of the officials. "The mob violence is being stomped out. The criminals responsible will be swiftly brought to justice, and the Trump administration's operations to arrest illegal aliens are continuing unabated," she added. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks with reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Thursday, May 29, 2025, in Washington. Leavitt went on to field questions from reporters about the "specific criteria" that Trump used to federalize California's National Guard. CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins argued members of the military would not be able to conduct arrests unless Trump invoked the Insurrection Act. Trump deployed 2,000 National Guardsman to Los Angeles this week, as well as 700 U.S. Marines. U.S. National Guards were deployed around downtown Los Angeles on Sunday, June 8, 2025, following an immigration raid protest the night before. Trump suggested earlier this week that he would be willing to arrest Newsom if his administration obstructs ICE operations amid riots in Los Angeles. "He's daring Tom Homan to come and arrest him. Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy asked. But I do think it would be a great thing. Trump suggested he would support arresting Newsom over the Los Angeles riots. Trump has also been vocal about his belief that many of the rioters and protesters in Los Angeles are professional agitators rather than real protesters. They should be in jail," Trump said. Newsom swiftly responded to Trump's comments in a post on social media. Anders Hagstrom is a reporter with Fox News Digital covering national politics and major breaking news events.

Jack Reed, D-R.I., who claimed during a Senate Appropriations Committee that Marines deploying to Los Angeles anti-ICE riots jeopardizes military readiness. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sparred with Democratic senators during a hearing Wednesday about the Trump administration's deployment of 700 Marines to Los Angeles amid the ongoing anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) riots. In his opening statement before the Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, Hegseth reiterated how President Donald Trump charged him to focus on restoring "warfighting, lethality, meritocracy, standards and readiness" to the Department of Defense – a point Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., later honed in on during his line of questioning for the secretary. Reed noted that the Trump administration federalized 4,000 California National Guard members and deployed 700 Marines to Los Angeles. Reed said what is happening in Los Angeles comes in addition to the approximately 11,000 military personnel, including active duty soldiers and National Guard members, who have deployed to the southern border in support of U.S. Customs and Border Protection – a figure which Hegseth corrected. The Defense secretary said some 13,000 military personnel have deployed to the southern border and that he has visited those troops several times. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth testifies during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing titled, "A Review of the President's Fiscal Year 2026 Budget Request for the Department of Defense," on June 11, 2025. When you talk to them, it actually improves their readiness," Hegseth said. How is this operation with Marines and National Guardsmen improving their lethality? "It's about maintaining law and order on behalf of law enforcement agents who deserve to do their job without being attacked by mobs of people. A Defense official told Fox News that the Marines who arrived in Los Angeles are an infantry unit and are still undergoing training, including in nonlethal weapons and use of force protocols in a domestic setting, at Seal Beach. Reed argued that "law and order is a civil function under the Constitution," but Hegseth said that "there is plenty of precedent for the U.S. supporting law enforcement officers." "What your military is doing right now is laying concertina wire, guarding buildings, maintaining vehicles for other services," Reed said. Graffiti saying "Blame Trump" is seen in downtown Los Angeles on June 11, 2025, as Gov. Gavin Newsom has argued President Donald Trump's intervention escalated the riots. A federal judge on Tuesday night declined California's request for an immediate restraining order to block Trump's use of military personnel and scheduled a court hearing to further weigh the legality of the matter for Thursday. In a separate line of questioning at the Senate hearing Wednesday, Hegseth said Newsom "wants to play politics." Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, had asked another witness, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. John D. Caine, if the United States had been "invaded by a foreign nation" or if "there is a rebellion somewhere in the United States." Caine deferred to the Department of Homeland Security to answer border-related questions in terms of a potential invasion and added on the question of a rebellion that, "there are certainly some frustrated folks out there." "It's quite easy to point out that there has been an invasion of 21 million illegals in our country under the previous administration, so this administration was elected to get a hold of that," Hegseth added. "And when you have ICE officers being attacked with concrete blocks, they should be allowed to do their jobs." From left to right, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Acting Pentagon Comptroller Bryn MacDonnell prepare to testify before a Senate Appropriations Committee on June 11, 2025. Schatz interjected, telling Hegseth he would "really like not to create a viral moment." The senator said he was trying to "understand the scope of the order," which, he says, does not specify a location or which Marines or which Guard members would be mobilized. I mean, create the framework for that," Schatz said. Hegseth said an initial order federalized 2,000 National Guard troops in California and there was a follow-up order for an additional 2,000 members because the situation there "required more resources in order to support law enforcement." "So part of it is getting ahead of a problem, so that if in other places, if there are other riots in places where law enforcement officers are threatened, we would have the capability to surge National Guard there if necessary," Hegseth said. In California, unfortunately, the governor wants to play politics with it." Fox News' Liz Friden contributed to this report.

Bryan Bedford, President Donald Trump's nominee to run the Federal Aviation Administration, testifies at the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, June 11, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Federal Aviation Administration pledged to prioritize safety and upgrade the nation's outdated air traffic control system during a Wednesday hearing with the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. Bryan Bedford faced tough questions in the confirmation hearing, which follows January's deadly midair collision in Washington, D.C., and a string of other crashes and near misses since then. But pilots unions and Democrats have raised concerns that he might weaken pilot training standards. Bedford has been CEO of regional airline Republic Airways since 1999 and has more than three decades of experience in the industry. “We shouldn't have to lean into the second or third or fourth level of redundancy to keep the system moving. So we have to do better,” Bedford said during the hearing. But he said the $12.5 billion that House Republicans have included in Trump's massive bill is only a down payment on the upgrades. The FAA has since banned some helicopter routes to make sure helicopters and planes no longer share the same airspace, but there have still been additional near misses in recent months. FAA's acting administrator and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have acknowledged the FAA's shortcomings in not recognizing the risk and pledged to review all the agency's data to identify any similar concerns nationwide about helicopter traffic near airports. That review prompted the agency to put new limits on helicopter flights around Las Vegas' airport. Pilots' unions and Democrats have raised concerns that Bedford may support weakening the 1,500-hour experience standard for airline pilots that was adopted after a 2009 crash or even might consider allowing some airlines to operate with only one pilot. Republic previously asked for permission to hire pilots with less experience because the standard was making it hard to find enough pilots. “What I'm saying is I don't believe safety is static,” Bedford said as he talked about how the military has changed pilot training to use more technology. Bedford said even if European officials have had some conversations about possibly allowing only one pilot under some circumstances, America is “a long ways away” from ever considering it. He said that's the case even as some companies are developing new technology that might be able to land a plane. “I do think that there are ways we can absolutely use technology to improve aviation safety,” Bedford said. “I don't think it goes so far as to tell us we need to remove a trained aviator from cockpit.” Bedford acknowledged Wednesday that “problems persist and more work needs to be done” to ensure the safety of flying around the nation's capital. He said his own airline's planes have received at least three alarms about conflicting traffic around Reagan since January. Bedford said his priority is modernizing the air traffic control system, and he reiterated that there is no plan to privatize the system because a debate over privatization derailed Trump's previous effort to upgrade the system in his first term. If confirmed, Bedford will also lead the FAA's effort to incorporate drones and flying taxis into the nation's airspace safely. Trump signed executive orders last week to encourage development of that emerging technology.</p>

Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., discuss the anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles and across the country on ‘The Faulkner Focus.' Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., launched an investigation into a left-wing group in California that he says may be financially supporting violent protests in Los Angeles. Hawley wrote a letter to the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) on Wednesday, saying the organization may have an "alleged role in financially and materially supporting" protests and riots in Los Angeles, which he described as "coordinated." As chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime & Terrorism, I'm launching an investigation to find out," Hawley announced on social media. The letter, addressed to CHIRLA Executive Director Angelica Salas, notes that "credible reporting" has indicated that the organization has provided "logistical support and financial resources to individuals engaged in these disruptive actions." "Let me be clear: bankrolling civil unrest is not protected speech. It is aiding and abetting criminal conduct. Accordingly, you must immediately cease and desist any further involvement in the organization, funding or promotion of these unlawful activities," Hawley wrote. The letter additionally requests that CHIRLA provide internal communications relating to any protest planning or funding, as well as financial documents related to the same, including third-party contracts, vendor agreements and various other business relationships. Hawley also requested travel records for individuals involved with the organization if they have been reimbursed by CHIRLA, as well as the organization's donor lists. A protester places debris in a fire as Border Patrol personnel in riot gear and gas masks stand guard outside an industrial park in Paramount, California, on Saturday, June 7, 2025. IRS records obtained by Fox News show that CHIRLA has received $34 million in government grants, including three from former President Joe Biden's administration for $750,000. President Donald Trump has already cut funding for the organization. Nevertheless, CHIRLA still receives state and city grant funds to support its lawyers fighting against deportations. CHIRLA is also responsible for creating the so-called Rapid Response Network, the hotline immigrants use to report ICE raids. The network then sends text alerts, giving migrants an opportunity to hide. CHIRLA founded a phone network that helps warn illegal immigrants of impending ICE raids. CHIRLA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. Trump has been vocal about his belief that many of the rioters and protesters in Los Angeles are professional agitators rather than real protesters. They should be in jail," Trump said, going on to suggest that he would support arresting California Gov. Gavin Newsom over his handling of the riots. President Donald Trump, right, has said he believes many rioters in Los Angeles are paid agitators. Newsom swiftly responded to Trump's comments in a post on social media.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Protests against immigration enforcement raids have spread beyond Los Angeles to cities including Seattle, Austin, Chicago and Washington, D.C. Both people are charged with possession of an unregistered destructive device, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said at a press conference Wednesday. Investigators are combing through FBI videos, body camera footage from law enforcement and other evidence on social media, said Essayli. Authorities expect to charge more people in the coming days and weeks. It used those cases to portray violent criminals as its primary targets and accuse political opponents of coddling them. “How much longer will Governor (Gavin) Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass continue to prioritize these criminal illegal aliens over their own citizens?” said Tricia McLaughlin, a department spokesperson. ICE will continue to enforce the law and arrest criminal illegal aliens.” Crowds of demonstrators rallying in solidarity with activists in Los Angeles took over a plaza and some surrounding streets amid rush hour traffic. Police said Wednesday that the injured woman fractured her left arm and was treated at a local hospital. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., left, hold a news conference on the GOP reconciliation bill, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, June 11, 2025. The defense of Newsom came as House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer were asked how Newsom should be dealing with Trump. Jeffries said Newsom “has been doing a tremendous job on behalf of the people of California.” He then used the question to state Democrats believe along with Newsom that anybody who commits violence or destroys property should be held accountable to the full extent of that law. At the same time, people have a right to “peacefully protest and petition their government.” Schumer said that Trump has been trying to intimidate Newsom. “All for him and proud that he is refusing to be intimidated by Donald Trump.” The protests took place around Foley Square Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning. Many in the large crowds, which police estimated at around 2,500 people, shouted out against federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement and waved signs that included “ICE out of NYC” as they rallied near an ICE facility and federal courthouses. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the vast majority of demonstrators were peaceful. She blamed smaller groups for causing the disorder that required police intervention. Police said they took 86 people into custody, including 52 who were released with criminal court summonses for minor crimes and 34 who were charged with assault, resisting arrest and other crimes. Some protesters clashed with police when they jumped over metal barricades and were wrestled to the ground by officers. Video also showed demonstrators throwing items at law enforcement vehicles.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull) About 700 Marines are still undergoing civil disturbance training at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach in Orange County, California, said Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, head of the task force that's overseeing the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles. Sherman wouldn't speculate about when the Marines might join the 2,000 or so Guard troops that have been deployed in downtown areas to protect federal buildings during sometimes violent demonstrations against President Trump's immigration crackdown. Another 2,000 Guard troops were expected to mobilize on Thursday, he said during a news conference. The streets of downtown Los Angeles began bustling with residents walking dogs and commuters clutching coffee cups after the overnight curfew was lifted at 6 a.m. Wednesday. Officials said at least two dozen people were arrested for violating the curfew, but overall they were fewer clashes between police and demonstrators than on previous nights. There were no signs of Marines deployed to downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday, joining the National Guard troops that are protecting federal buildings and ICE agents making arrests. “The president's decision to federalize and deploy California's National Guard without the consent of California state leaders is unlawful, unconstitutional, and undemocratic,” the attorneys general said in a statement released by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. In their capacity as the chief legal officers of the 18 states, they also expressed support for California Attorney General Rob Bonta's court challenge to Trump's order. “We oppose any action from this administration that will sow chaos, inflame tensions, and put people's lives at risk — including those of our law-enforcement officers,” they wrote. The hundreds who marched Tuesday evening down thoroughfares in the city, blocking traffic and chanting, were eventually told to disperse by police. Three people were arrested on assault charges, according to Denver police. Other charges included graffiti, unlawfully throwing projectiles and failing to following the police's orders. Sheinbaum added more details Wednesday — claiming her opponents had “completely taken out of context” her previous comments suggesting that Mexicans could protest a tax on remittances proposed by Trump. “We have never called for a violent demonstration,” she said. Mayor Ron Nirenberg said city officials did not ask for the Texas National Guard to be deployed to the city ahead of planned protests Wednesday night and Saturday. Greg Abbott's office said Tuesday night that National Guard troops were “on standby” in areas where demonstrations are planned. San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said he has not been told by either the governor's office or the guard how many troops would be in the city, where they would be positioned or what they will be doing. The governor's office has not publicly released those details. “We are prepared for a peaceful demonstration, but we are also prepared if something goes south and it turns violent,” McManus said. Protesters gather to denounce ICE, U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement, operations Tuesday, June 10, 2025, in Los Angeles. In Orange County, a day laborer said he started carrying his green card everywhere. California National Guard are positioned at the Federal Building on Tuesday, June 10, 2025, in downtown Los Angeles. While many have been peaceful, some have resulted in clashes with law enforcement as officers made arrests and used chemical irritants to disperse crowds. Activists are planning more and even larger demonstrations in the coming days, with “No Kings” events across the country on Saturday to coincide with Trump's planned military parade through Washington. “ICE will continue to enforce the law,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted Tuesday on social media. New York City police detained more than 80 people during protests around lower Manhattan's Foley Square against federal immigration enforcement actions Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning. It's one of the most extreme emergency powers available to a U.S. president. “If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. Los Angeles police swiftly enforced a downtown curfew, making arrests moments after it took effect, while deploying officers on horseback and using crowd control projectiles to break up a group of hundreds of demonstrators. Members of the National Guard stood watch behind plastic shields, but did not appear to participate in the arrests Tuesday night. Hours later, many of the protesters had dispersed, although sporadic confrontations continued that were much smaller than in previous nights. Gavin Newsom asked a court to put an emergency stop to the military helping federal immigration agents, with some guardsmen now standing in protection around agents as they carried out arrests. He said it would only heighten tensions and promote civil unrest.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How to navigate a world where MAHA is setting vaccine policy. For the past 60 years, a committee of independent experts has advised the federal government on vaccine policy, providing guidance on which shots people should get and when. But on Monday, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired every sitting member of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a move that stunned doctors and scientists across the country. New committee members will be announced at some point, but as of Tuesday morning, even top US senators did not know who the replacements would be. The panel is supposed to hold one of its periodic public meetings in late June to discuss the Covid-19 vaccine, as well as shots for RSV and HPV, among others. This is a watershed moment in US public health, one that seems sure to sow confusion among patients and health care providers. The deepening divide between Kennedy's Make American Healthy Again (MAHA) movement and mainstream medicine could make it harder for people who want vaccines to get them, while encouraging more doubt about the value and safety of shots among the general public. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Kennedy asserted the committee “has been plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.” It may be a little “hot dog guy meme” that the man who may have done more than any other person to erode public trust in vaccines is now complaining about the problem of eroding public trust in vaccines. But it fits with his broader critique of the medical establishment being beholden to big business interests at the expense of patients, a critique that many Americans share. Kennedy has said mainstream scientists — the kind who staffed ACIP before this week — have been too deferential to pharma companies and too reluctant to consider vaccines' supposed harms, including the long-debunked claim that vaccines can cause autism, which Kennedy has pushed for years. He directed an anti-vaccine researcher to scour federal data for evidence of a vaccine-autism link. His department's recent MAHA report on childhood chronic disease named vaccines as one example of how the US overmedicalizes its children and exposes them to artificial agents that could do harm to their body. Then in late May, Kennedy oversaw a revision of the federal government's Covid-19 vaccine guidance, limiting the shots to elderly people and those who are immunocompromised. He ended the recommendation that pregnant women and kids get a Covid vaccine shot, even though studies have shown they help confer immunity to infants, who are at a higher risk from the virus and cannot be vaccinated until they are 6 months old. The move plainly circumvented ACIP's accepted role in setting vaccine policy, presaging this week's mass firing. People are reasonably left to wonder whether they can trust forthcoming CDC guidance on vaccines, and just what vaccines they'll be able to get. In the past, ACIP would typically meet a few times a year to discuss any additions or changes to the country's vaccine schedule. Importantly, most health plans are required to cover any shots that the committee recommends. Will doctors follow the CDC guidance, even if it changes under a new advisory panel staffed by Kennedy loyalists, or will they stick with the earlier vaccine schedule? Once-unthinkable questions could soon be something doctors and patients must deal with every day. They considered those groups, as well as guidance from European health authorities, the best substitutes we currently have for information on vaccines if the CDC's recommendations can no longer be taken at face value. “It's been a confusing several days, confusing last two weeks, and I'm not sure that confusion is going to be abated in the near future,” John Lynch, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Washington, said on the call. And more could surface: The AAP currently recommends Gardasil for the HPV virus, which has proven successful in preventing cervical cancer, but Kennedy has expressed concerns about its safety. “These are evidence-based guidelines developed by experts in the field using transparent methods and published publicly,” Lynch said. Kennedy, in explaining his change to the Covid vaccine guidelines, said he wanted to encourage shared decision-making between providers and their patients. The doctors from the IDSA said that such conversations are already to be considered best practice among physicians — and noted Kennedy's undermining of trust in the federal vaccine policy would now make them more important. “I would just emphasize the need to have a good source of information when this situation occurs. If indeed shared decision making is going to occur, we always do our research,” Dr. Flor Muñoz-Rivas at Baylor College of Medicine said. There is a lot we don't know right now: Who will be named to the new panel? But the experts warned that Kennedy's rhetoric alone risks undermining people's confidence in vaccinations. “All health care decisions are shared decision-making; this is not a special concept that's only rolled out for conversations like vaccination,” Lynch said on the IDSA call. Kennedy has quickly disrupted decades of public health consensus. Those scenes should have helped dispel the notion that they were acting as a rubber-stamp for any new shot Big Pharma produced. But the nation's top health official is now telling Americans that they should never have trusted the ACIP, which risks pushing more people to skip routine immunization. Shortly after the country declared measles eradicated in 2000, 94 percent of adults said childhood immunizations were extremely or very important. But that consensus has since weakened: 69 percent of Americans said the same in 2024. If changing opinion leads to declining vaccination rates, diseases that we successfully stamped out through vaccines to rebound — which is exactly what we are seeing now with measles. One outbreak that accounts for most of those cases took off in a small Texas community where vaccination rates had fallen far below the 95-percent threshold that is considered necessary to stop the virus's spread. Other knock on effects could hurt Americans who still want to get vaccinated. Pharma companies, the target of so much of Kennedy's criticism, could decide to stop pursuing new vaccines if they believe the federal government will limit access as much as possible, shrinking the world's biggest pharmaceutical market. Vaccines are not big moneymakers for drug companies, and they have often relied on the US government's support to develop new ones. Kennedy, however, has canceled major vaccine development contracts during his first few months as health secretary, including a $700 million contract with Moderna, one of two companies that produced the mRNA Covid vaccines, to work on a universal flu shot. Kennedy has quickly disrupted decades of public health consensus. For now, the best reaction is, oddly enough, for patients and providers to take him at his word when he says people should not take medical advice from him — and make their own decisions in collaboration with their doctors. The quiet revolutions that have prevented millions of cancer deaths. Suddenly can't stand the way your partner chews? Ketamine, the drug that reportedly messed up Musk's bladder, is a public health paradox. Getting hot for the summer isn't cutting it anymore.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House Republicans are touting that their sweeping tax and spending cuts package would kick many “illegal immigrants” off federal assistance, fulfilling one of President Donald Trump's top priorities. House Speaker Mike Johnson has repeatedly emphasized that the bill would stop 1.4 million “illegal aliens” from accessing Medicaid. However, undocumented immigrants in the US won't be as heavily affected by the legislation since they already can't access nearly all federal government assistance programs, experts say. Those more in danger of losing some benefits are millions of legal immigrants, as well as children who are citizens but whose parents may be undocumented or have various legal statuses. Related article House GOP lawmakers are proposing nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and food stamps. “This bill would deny eligibility to lawfully residing immigrants who have authorization to live and work in the US and who pay taxes that support the services that we all depend on.” It also takes aim at states that provide Medicaid-like coverage to undocumented immigrants with their own funds. Currently, immigrants' eligibility for federal benefits depends on their status, of which there are many categories. Among those authorized to be in the US, certain groups can qualify right away, others must wait several years. Some immigrant children and pregnant women can access Medicaid sooner if states opt to allow them. But immigrants with other legal statuses do not qualify for any public assistance. Undocumented immigrants generally only qualify for what's known as Emergency Medicaid, which reimburses hospitals for the emergency care they are required to provide. Separately, some states provide health coverage to certain undocumented immigrants, most commonly children, using only state funds. “This bill nibbles around the edges,” said Camarota. The proposed changes could have devastating consequences for vulnerable immigrant communities, particularly those who rely on public benefits to survive, said Beatriz Ortiz, a senior staff attorney at the International Rescue Committee. Prior to joining IRC, Ortiz worked at Ayuda, where she represented immigrants as a staff attorney. One of the most consequential changes involves the child tax credit, which House Republicans want to temporarily boost to $2,500 per child, from $2,000. Currently, families can receive the credit if the parents file their tax returns with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN, which is used by some legal and undocumented immigrants — as long as the child has a Social Security number. The Center for Migration Studies estimates the number is closer to 4.5 million children who are US citizens or lawful permanent residents, otherwise known as green card holders. “It singles out and disadvantages US citizen children because of their parents' immigration status,” said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noting that research shows the credit has a positive impact on children's health, educational attainment and, eventually, earnings. Similarly, the “Trump accounts” that the legislation would create would require both parents to have Social Security numbers to be eligible to claim the $1,000 federal contribution for their US-born citizen babies. Refugees, people approved for asylum, domestic violence victims and survivors of labor or sex trafficking would no longer qualify. Only citizens, green card holders, certain Cuban parolees and migrants from certain Pacific Ocean island nations would be able to receive food stamps. Between 120,000 and 250,000 people would lose access to this food assistance over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Gloria, who fled gang violence in El Salvador in 2010 hoping for safety in the US, worries that she could lose a portion of the food stamps that she and her five children, who are citizens, depend on. If this president decided to take it away, I would be very affected. I live off the SNAP benefits,” said Gloria, who lives in Washington DC and has a T-visa, a protection for trafficking survivors. Gloria, who asked that CNN not use her full name for fear of retribution, said she was trafficked by her own mother and aunt in Maryland — forced to work at a carpet factory, sleep on the floor and hand over all her wages under threats of deportation from her own family until she finally escaped. One asylum recipient from Egypt, who asked to be identified only as H.E. so as not to jeopardize his immigration status, told CNN that he depends on food stamps. “If I lose those benefits, it's going to be bad,” said H.E., who lives in a shelter in Virginia, is unemployed and has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The package would also block many legal immigrants from receiving Affordable Care Act premium subsidies and Medicare coverage, making it harder for them to obtain health coverage from both the government and private insurers. Under the bill, asylees, refugees, temporary protected status holders and victims of domestic violence or sex trafficking, among others, would no longer be eligible for Obamacare subsidies or Medicare, even if they worked in the US for the 10-plus years it takes for senior citizens to qualify for the latter program. One million more people would be uninsured in 2034 if these immigrants lost access to the Affordable Care Act subsidies, according to CBO estimates. The House bill would cut the share of federal matching funds these states receive for covering low-income adults under Medicaid expansion to 80%, from 90%, which would double states' costs. The CBO expects this provision would result in 1.4 million more people being uninsured in 2034 – the figure that Johnson often cites, even though these folks are not enrolled in the federal Medicaid program. The penalty could also hit the states that cover immigrant children and pregnant women with certain legal statuses – including those with temporary protected status and student visas – through a separate state Children's Health Insurance Program. But since the penalty only applies to states that have expanded Medicaid, Pennsylvania and West Virginia would be hit, for instance, but not Florida or Texas, said Leonardo Cuello, research professor for the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. “The states are going to have a huge incentive to drop their coverage because the alternative is a massive increase in spending,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. There are around 28 species of crocodiles found throughout the world's tropical and subtropical regions. But there is only one species in Jamaica, found primarily along the southern coast from St. Thomas to Westmoreland. But in recent years, its population has been decimated, due to illegal hunting, habitat loss and plastic pollution, as well as killings prompted by a lingering fear among locals. Lawrence Henriques has made it his life's mission to change that. From this remote corner of the island, he's trying to undo years of damage: nursing sick crocs back to health, raising juveniles and restoring their numbers in the wild. “There's a real fear of crocodiles in Jamaica,” says Henriques. So if one turns up in someone's backyard, it's often killed for meat or just because people are afraid.” While reliable figures are hard to come by, according to the global database CrocAttack, there have been 11 incidents reported over the past decade in Jamaica, including one fatality in 2018. That's why Henriques is working to change the narrative about the animal and help people understand that they are far less threatening than their reputation suggests. Born and raised in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, during the 1960s, Henriques always had a penchant for “creepy crawlies,” such as spiders, scorpions and snakes. After studying overseas and learning more about reptiles when working with the Scientific Exploration Society, a UK charity, in Belize, Henriques returned to Jamaica in 1980. He was startled to find that despite crocodiles being classified as endangered in 1971 under the Wildlife Protection Act, there was little practical conservation happening. “The laws were there, but nobody was doing anything,” he says. “The environmental agency was very under-resourced and still is to this day. And there was nobody really with expertise or knowledge on reptiles.” Henriques volunteered to assist the Jamaican government, carrying out crocodile rescues and providing rehabilitation, all while holding down a job in the citrus industry. He continued like this for almost 20 years, before a brief relocation to London, UK. When he returned to Jamaica in 2010, he launched what would become the Holland Bay Crocodile Sanctuary — a facility dedicated to rescue, rehabilitation and public education. The juvenile crocs have been bred on site and are typically released into the wild after three years, while the adults have been rescued and rehabilitated after being hit by cars, caught in traps, or found living in squalid conditions. Savannah Boan, an international ambassador from Gatorland Global, the conservation arm of the Florida-based wildlife park which helps to fund the sanctuary, says that since being relocated, Xena's skin has healed and her teeth are white again. “Lawrence is doing extraordinary work with very limited resources,” she tells CNN. Poaching is rampant, often driven by demand for meat or misguided fear, according to officers from the country's National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA). “Poaching is definitely a huge problem,” says Leighton Mamdeen, an environmental officer at NEPA. “We try to limit it through enforcement measures such as regular monitoring and we partner with the Jamaica Constabulary Force and the Jamaica Defence Force to do patrols.” According to media reports, there is a thriving black market for crocodile meat and eggs in Jamaica, with the meat sold for as much as 5,000 Jamaican dollars ($31) a pound (450 grams) – more than 10 times the price of chicken meat. This could stem from a widespread misconception in some rural communities that crocodile meat has aphrodisiac properties. Damany Calder, another environmental officer at NEPA, says he has noticed a troubling pattern during callouts, when crocodiles are discovered with their tails removed. “There's a rumour about the crocodile tail… it's (used) either for sexual performance, fertility or longevity,” he says. Related article Gorillas once caught by wildlife traffickers are set free in historic reintroduction In other cases, crocodiles have been found in backyard ponds, kept as pets, or used as props for TikTok stunts or music videos. This affects the country's coastal resilience, as mangroves reduce wave energy and storm surges, helping to prevent flooding, and it damages biodiversity, as they are serve as nurseries for fish and provide essential habitat for species like crocodiles. As this territory shrinks, crocodiles are forced closer to humans. “These animals are ending up in places they've always lived,” Henriques says. “But now those places are towns and roads … We've taken their habitat.” Related article The fish collectors hoping to save rare species from extinction It even features on the Jamaican coat of arms, which shows a crocodile perched atop a royal helmet and mantling, designed to symbolize the island's unique wildlife and natural heritage. “They dig channels, control fish populations and keep the wetlands healthy.” He explains that the presence of these apex predators helps to regulate biodiversity within aquatic ecosystems by controlling prey populations and creating microhabitats that support various flora and fauna. But Henriques warns that because of poaching and habitat loss, the island no longer has many large male crocodiles left along the coastline: “Most now are smaller. “What's happening in Jamaica reflects a global pattern — wetland species are disappearing, and with them, the health of the entire ecosystem,” he adds. “One of the most impactful things we've done is visit schools,” says Mamdeen. “If you're near water at night, walk with a stick. Henriques added: “People are beginning to understand these animals have a place … They're not pests.</p>

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) will address Californians at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday as the standoff between the governor and the Trump administration over the Los Angeles riots continues to simmer.

Newsom announced the address Tuesday evening, “in response to President Trump's assault on democracy and the President's illegal militarization of Los Angeles.”

LA RIOTS: WHO ARE THE GROUPS PROTESTING?

The address comes just hours after a federal judge declined to block Trump's deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles.

After protests in the city turned violent against federal immigration officers conducting raids, Trump ordered the National Guard to Los Angeles over the weekend, the first time it was deployed without a governor's consent since 1965. Trump also sent Marines to the city on Monday for additional support.</p>
