                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Polling shows that three-quarters of Americans oppose Trump's decision to hold a military parade this weekend. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump warned that anyone planning to engage in protests against his military parade this weekend would be met with “big force” — a statement that is antithetical to the free speech and assembly rights established by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In comments on the parade to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said that Saturday, June 14, will be an “amazing day” that will include Army tanks, planes and “all sorts of things.” He also indicated that his administration was prepared to suppress any demonstrations against the parade. “If there's any protest that wants to come out, they will be met with very big force,” Trump warned. Trump says anybody who protests the military parade on Sunday will be met with “very heavy force” pic.twitter.com/iDm4qVzKg3 “Those people who want to protest…[will be] met with very big force,” he said. Trump also insinuated that those taking part in such protests were un-American, claiming that those protesting his parade would include “people who hate our country.” However, recent polling data demonstrates that Trump's views run counter to those of most Americans. A PRRI poll published on Tuesday, for example, found that more than three-quarters of Americans (76 percent) oppose having a military parade at all, with nearly one in two respondents saying they “strongly oppose” the idea. A flash poll conducted by YouGov earlier this week also found that more Americans opposed Trump's militaristic response to the L.A. protests than supported them. Trump's approval rating, which has been in negative territory for months, has also sunk slightly following his announced deployment of U.S. troops to L.A., according to an aggregate of surveys from RealClearPolling. Indeed, an Economist/YouGov poll published on Tuesday found that Trump's approval rating stood at only 43 percent, with 52 percent of Americans disapproving of his job performance so far in his second term. Hundreds of demonstrations against Trump, dubbed “No Kings protests,” are set to take place across the U.S. on Saturday, including several near Washington, D.C.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Condemnation is growing of President Trump's travel ban that went into effect Monday, banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States: Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and the Republic of Congo. It also imposes heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. President Trump is “destroying what this nation stands for,” says Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition. “Immigration in the U.S. is an American value.” Guerline Jozef, co-founder and executive director of Haitian Bridge Alliance, called on communities to “fight to make sure that people have the right to migrate.” The administration is “literally separating families,” says Jozef. Copy may not be in its final form. NERMEEN SHAIKH: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. It also imposes heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the U.S. and don't hold a valid visa. Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown said he may challenge the ban with what he called a “hostile” Supreme Court. It will tear families apart at life's most sacred moments, keep loved ones from mourning, celebrating and holding each other close in their final moments. It will steal opportunities from brilliant students who deserve a future. It promises four more years of separation, four more years of sorrow, and we cannot allow this. ATTORNEY GENERAL NICHOLAS BROWN: The president's order is unclearly — is clearly unfair, discriminatory and will impact millions and millions of people who pose no risk whatsoever to our country. And when we couple this travel ban with everything else that we are seeing in this country at this moment, including the president's violent escalation of events in California this week, we know what we are seeing from the president of the United States of America is creeping authoritarianism. NERMEEN SHAIKH: This follows Trump's first travel ban in 2017. Immigrant rights groups have been organizing as the ban takes effect this week, including two organizers who join us now. In New York, Guerline Jozef is co-founder and executive director of Haitian Bridge Alliance. Haiti is one of the countries included in this travel ban. So, if you could talk about the impact of that on Haiti, which is dependent not only so much on aid, international aid, but also on remittances from Haitians working in the U.S.? GUERLINE JOZEF: Thank you so much for having me. And for those who don't know, Haiti is literally 90 minutes away from Miami. In the current ban literally separating families, I spoke to three people as we got the announcement, and two of them were supposed to go visit family in Canada, and they are stuck. What will that mean when they try to leave or reenter the country will have a big impact on how the community continues to move forward. AMY GOODMAN: So, do you know, Guerline, why Haiti was put on this list? The kind of impact this total ban will have? They are saying that people from Haiti tend to overstay their visas. And I want to clarify a couple of things. As you mentioned, 1.3 million people who are completely displaced within the country, and at the same time, we are hearing that there might be a deportation flight to Haiti within the next few days. We are seeing the impact of this Trump travel ban and other immigration policies completely destroying communities that are vulnerable. And we must be able to push back. So, it is imperative that people understand what's happening. And we are seeing that they have had a lot of practice. But we are here pushing back, fighting on behalf of those communities and making sure that they are protected, from California in San Diego — AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to bring Murad Awawdeh into the conversation, with the New York Immigration Coalition, though today he happens to be in Montgomery. And, Murad, I think that's interesting you're in Montgomery, because you have President Trump calling out the National Guard, federalizing it, in Los Angeles. The last time this happened — I mean, it hasn't happened in 60 years — was in the civil rights era, was to guarantee that the Selma to Montgomery March of civil rights workers, led by Dr. Martin Luther King and John Lewis, would be able to march. And President Trump now, 60 years later, not because of civil rights issues, but actually against civil rights issues, is making this move. But I wanted to ask you about this ban. In 2017, we were talking about a Muslim ban. MURAD AWAWDEH: The impact that this has on U.S. citizens is going to be immense. This is going to continue to double and triple down on the terror that this administration is waging against immigrant communities across the board. And what we need to do is, as my sister Guerline mentioned earlier, is actually stand up and continue to fight back against this. And I often say this: If some of us don't have rights in this country, none of us do. This is a really — this is a call to all Americans to start standing up and fighting back. This is going to be the test case. There was reports yesterday on MSNBC that what they're doing in L.A., which is horrifying to immigrant communities, but also to Americans, is going to be spread across the country and targeting U.S. cities, like New York City and other blue cities across the country. NERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Murad, I just want to — because Guerline mentioned that one of the reasons, justifications given by the Trump administration for imposing the travel ban on certain countries was people who overstayed their visas. But the absolute numbers, there is an exponential difference. So, in the case 2023 to 2024, the 50% [overstay rate] from Chad amounted to 377 people, as against 20,000 people from Spain. So, if you could comment on what you think — and we have a minute left — on what the real justification for this ban, the countries that were selected, and then the New York for All Act that you're advocating? MURAD AWAWDEH: So, the Trump administration doesn't need any help in trying to come up with frivolous excuses. They are a administration that is gung ho on destroying what this nation stands for. Like, I don't know how much more to explain this. But their excuses continue to fly in the face of facts. And what we're doing right now across the state of New York is fighting for the New York for All Act, which would prohibit state collusion with immigration enforcement. We have a few days left in the state Legislature, and we're urging the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly, as well as Governor Hochul, to really stand up and protect our communities. The New York for All Act is a public safety measure. NERMEEN SHAIKH: Murad Awawdeh, New York Immigration Coalition, thanks so much for joining us, and Guerline Jozef, here in New York, of the Haitian Bridge Alliance. Coming up, Israel is continuing to detain eight people after Israeli Navy commandos intercepted a Gaza-bound boat carrying humanitarian aid. Four others on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla have already been deported. We'll get an update from a Spanish crew member who's been deported back to Spain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Greg Abbott says troops ‘on standby' in response to local police request ahead of planned protests this week Abbott posted on social media early on Wednesday that the national guard “will be deployed to locations across the state to ensure peace & order. Harming a person or property is illegal & will lead to arrest.” The Texas national guard, he added, “will use every tool & strategy to help law enforcement maintain order”. Abbott's move to mobilize troops follows Donald Trump's decision on Saturday to send the California national guard into Los Angeles after some limited and mostly peaceful protests against immigration raids. Widespread demonstrations against the Trump administration's deportation raids are expected on Wednesday, according to local media reports, and on Saturday nationwide protests are planned as part of a “No Kings” event, according to organizers. Trump has planned a military parade in Washington for the same day and has threatened to treat any protesters harshly, despite the right to protest being enshrined in the US constitution. Unlike in California, where neither the state governor not local civic leaders asked for military help – and where the state has sued to have them removed – in Texas the guard was reportedly sent after San Antonio law enforcement requested their assistance. “Peaceful protests are part of the fabric of our nation, but Texas will not tolerate the lawlessness we have seen in Los Angeles,” Mahaleris said in a statement on Tuesday night. “Anyone engaging in acts of violence or damaging property will be swiftly held accountable to the full extent of the law.” On Sunday about 300 protesters had gathered in downtown San Antonio, some carrying flags and signs reading: “Abolish ICE,” “Power to the People,” and “Mexicans Ain't Going Anywhere.” They have been charged with felony criminal mischief, resisting arrest and other offenses. “Texas is a law-and-order state, and the department has zero tolerance for individuals disrupting public order or endangering law enforcement officers,” DPS said in a news release.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beatle wrote in 1962 letter to Cynthia Powell that he wished he was on his way to her flat with ‘chocies and a throbber' John Lennon is considered by many to be a poet. But the Beatle revealed his more prosaic side in a letter penned in 1962 to his future wife Cynthia Powell, in which he declared: “I wish I was on the way to your flat with the Sunday papers and chocies and a throbber.” The intimate missive, which includes a complaint about his bandmate Paul McCartney's snoring, is now being sold at auction by Christie's with a £30,000 to £40,000 estimate. He then tells Cynthia he does not like the idea of McCartney's then girlfriend, Dot Rhone, moving in with her, saying: “We would never be alone really … imagine having her there all the time when we were in bed – and imagine Paul coming all the time.” He adds: “I love you please wait for me and don't be sad and work hard be a clever little Cyn Powell.” Lennon and Cynthia, who was a year older than him, had been in a relationship for four years, having met at Liverpool College of Art. They married in August 1962 and their son, Julian, was born in April 1963, weeks after Beatlemania exploded with the release of their chart-topping first album, Please Please Me. The couple divorced in 1968 and she later claimed he had inflicted physical abuse on her throughout their relationship, including slapping her face in a fit of jealousy. It provides an early insight into the Beatles from their time in Hamburg which was so important to their development as a band.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We asked Marlene Lenarduzzi, chief risk officer at EQ Bank, to tackle this one: When my kids were little, I remember older women saying to me, ‘Enjoy it. You'll be surprised at how much they can do. It teaches them good life skills and builds their character. When it comes to discussing challenges with your manager, you want to be known as someone who can deliver results and come up with solutions. If you're coming to them saying, ‘I have this problem, what are you going to do about it?' But if you are coming to them saying, ‘This is how I'm going manage this time in my life,' that will go a lot further. So, if you need to drop your children at daycare in the morning and it's hard to get in to work before 9:00 a.m., come up with a solution that says: I will start work at nine. But I will log in at 9:00 p.m. once they're in bed to catch up on what I missed. If you have a reputation for coming to work with great attitude and delivering results, your manager isn't going to care that you aren't available for 8:00 a.m. meetings. I didn't waste a lot of time. But I do want to say that it's also important to cut ourselves some slack and recognize that we are human. You shouldn't feel guilty about the time that you need to be with your kids, either because they're sick or you want to attend a school assembly. If you want to get ahead, don't forget your network. I know it can be challenging to have a drink with colleagues after work if you need to get your kids from daycare, but maybe you can find a lunch or a coffee in the morning to meet with people in your network. You'll find that a lot of people are in the same boat. I think there's much more flexibility and understanding for different ways of connecting. These women are leading in male-dominated industries – and they're hiring all-women teams Annastacia Plaskos runs Fix It Females, a home renovation business that does everything from house painting to drywalling to building. The business rapidly grew from three to nearly 40 employees within a few years – all of them women. Hiring only female workers was intentional for Ms. Plaskos, who grew tired of having to prove herself to the male tradespeople she was working with, along with experiencing sexism and pay disparities in the industry. Protect the sacred space of leisure from being contaminated by work Gloria Mark, a leading researcher on attention and distraction and University of California informatics professor, warns us to beware of leisure contamination: The tendency while taking a break to still be wrestling with work and family responsibilities. It's a mental spillover of stress into those rare moments that are meant to be restful. But achieving it in our always-connected, always-on, busy culture is getting harder and harder to do,” she writes on her Substack blog. How being the ‘CEO of your career' can help you get that promotion “Be explicit about what your goals and aspirations are. Don't assume that your manager or your organization knows what you want,” says Liz Samson, head of industry relations and operations at Square Canada. “Come to that conversation prepared with a list of accomplishments and their impact.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed off on a recommendation to the Treasury Department last month to open an investigation into Harvard University, a report says.Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is pushing to investigate whether Harvard University violated federal sanctions, The New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by the newspaper. Rubio is pushing to investigate if Harvard violated sanctions by collaborating on a health insurance conference in China that may have included officials blacklisted by the U.S., the paper said. Analysis: Harvard versus Trump is the new battle for independence A Treasury Department spokesman said the agency takes “any allegations of sanctions violations extremely seriously” but declined to comment on possible or pending investigations. A State Department spokesperson also declined to comment. Harvard University did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The Trump administration has launched a multipronged attack on the country's oldest and wealthiest university, freezing billions of dollars in grants and other funding and proposing to end its tax-exempt status, prompting a series of legal challenges.

"We're very proud of our city (Springfield, OR, U.S.) for supporting our efforts to make this happen," one community member told the Kyiv Independent. For decades, global usage favored Russian-based spellings, a legacy of the Soviet Union's dominance and the widespread misconception that Ukrainian cities and culture were merely extensions of Russia. Even after Ukraine declared independence in 1991, much of the international community continued using names like Kiev, Lvov, and Odessa — all Russified versions. That began to change after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and its war in eastern Ukraine. The full-scale invasion in 2022 accelerated the shift, prompting governments, media outlets, and advocacy groups to adopt Ukrainian transliterations such as Kyiv, Lviv, and Odesa. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has promoted the change through campaigns like #KyivNotKiev, arguing that the use of correct names respects Ukraine's sovereignty and resists Russian imperial narratives. Russian leaders, including President Vladimir Putin, have long emphasized historical ties to Kyiv in their justification for expansionist policies. Renaming streets and using correct spellings is one way communities abroad are pushing back. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Curfew order: Police have started “mass arrests” of protesters after an emergency curfew came into effect for part of downtown Los Angeles. It will be in place from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. local time and will likely be in effect for a few days, Mayor Karen Bass said. • National Guard deployed in Texas: Members of the Texas National Guard will be deployed to various locations in the state ahead of planned protests this week, Gov. The mayor said that 23 businesses were looted during four days of protests. Senior US District Judge Charles R. Breyer set a hearing for Thursday. They are standing by and awaiting orders outside LA, and many of them are undergoing additional training prior to assisting with the protests, US officials told CNN. Over the past few days, demonstrators have said they are speaking out for members of their community, many who fear taking to the streets themselves. They are our community members,” Laiba Khan, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, told CNN affiliate KEYE. What began as a show of solidarity devolved into chaos in Austin on Monday, when police declared an unlawful gathering outside the J.J. Pickle Federal Building, later deploying tear gas on demonstrators, KEYE reported. Another protest near the State Capitol building, also in Austin, ended with law enforcement deploying tear gas and pepper rounds, the Texas Department of Public Safety said. Thirteen people were arrested in the city, police said. About 180 miles away in Dallas, video from a Monday demonstration shows a tense standoff unfolding between protesters and police in riot gear. Several demonstrators, their faces covered with bandanas and masks, were heard shouting expletives. An observer told CNN that police used what he believes was mace on a person being restrained and another person attempting to intervene. Hundreds gathered outside San Antonio's City Hall on Sunday in a protest that remained peaceful, CNN affiliate KSAT reported. Ahead of more demonstrations in the southern Texas city, Mayor Ron Nirenberg urged residents to “exercise their rights…safely and responsibly.” Members of the Texas National Guard will be deployed to various locations in the state ahead of planned protests this week, Gov. South Texas organizations are expected to hold anti-ICE rallies on Wednesday and Saturday, CNN affiliate KSAT reported. Among the demonstrations is a “No Kings” protest in San Antonio this Saturday. Abbott's announcement comes a day after authorities used tear gas and pepper ball projectiles to disperse demonstrators at Austin's State Capitol Complex. “Peaceful protest is legal,” Abbott said in a post on X. “Harming a person or property is illegal and will lead to arrest.” “I'm just standing there working, and then all of a sudden … I mean, I was sort of semi-conscious of the fact that the guy was aiming at me or aiming in my direction, and that thing traveled so quickly. The crowd of protesters on Sunday was large, he said, estimating it reached several thousand people at its peak. “The initial response from law enforcement, you know, there was no standoff. The Los Angeles Police Department said late Tuesday it had begun carrying out “mass arrests” after several protest groups continued to gather in the designated curfew zone. In an earlier post about an hour before the curfew took effect, the LAPD said “dozens of arrests” had been made for failure to disperse. Correction: A previous version of this post incorrectly described arrests that were made after curfew. One person was seen being physically restrained and placed on the ground, hands zip-tied behind his back. Meanwhile, a helicopter from the California Highway Patrol is flying roughly 1,000 feet above Little Tokyo in downtown Los Angeles, where the curfew is being enacted, according to flight tracking data. A curfew is in place for parts of downtown Los Angeles until 6 a.m. Pacific Time. It only applies to a small patch of the city - an area of about 1 square mile - but, according to retired Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, it may play an important role in de-escalating protests and allowing peaceful demonstrators to go home. “I think it gives officers a time to rest a little bit,” said Johnson, who led the response to the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a police officer in 2014. “The protesters that are there legally protesting will go home. Anti-ICE protesters gathered in Denver on Tuesday, the Associated Press reported, carrying cardboard signs including one that read “Show your faces. A spokesperson from the Denver Police Department told CNN they had not deployed any tear gas, contrary to some reports. The area is roughly 1 square mile, Mayor Karen Bass said. A law enforcement source familiar with the situation told CNN fewer than 100,000 of LA's 4 million residents will be affected, . “Any person who remains engaged in unlawful assembly or criminal activity will be detained and arrested,” the Los Angeles Police Department said in a recent post on X. Multiple lines of law enforcement including National Guardsmen and Homeland Security agents were seen stationed outside a detention facility in the curfew area, according to CNN's Nick Watt, who is on the ground. “There are definitely people here who feel strongly about this cause,” Watt said. Nearly 200 people were arrested on Tuesday, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell told press today. Gavin Newsom's Tuesday night address, in which he warned the American people that “democracy is under attack.” In response, White House Director of Communications Steven Chung rebutted “NewScum must've hired Kamala and Biden's loser campaign team because he saying this is a ‘threat to democracy,' in a post on X. In a post on X, White House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson called such a response “Newsom playbook 101: blaming his own incompetence on President Trump. Some context: After the governor's address was plagued by technical issues, Newsom's team apologized for a momentary silence, jokingly attributing “Trump-era transparency rules” for the delay in broadcast. Dozens of police in riot gear, holding batons, have surrounded a federal building in downtown Chicago, where a small group of protesters continue to honk and shout at officers. The scene remains tense but is much calmer compared to some hours ago, when Chicago police were in physical interactions with protesters at an intersection. Earlier video from CNN affiliate WBBM showed a car plowing through protesters on Monroe Street and Wabash Avenue during a large and mostly peaceful protest. The car appeared to clip pedestrians holding signs and a bicyclist. CNN is working to determine whether any arrests have been made throughout the day. Dozens of demonstrators surrounded Foley Square in downtown Manhattan, near a government building that houses the city's Immigration Customs and Enforcement office and main immigration court. ET, a small group of protesters was seen surging toward police who appeared to be making arrests while blocking demonstrators off with metal barricades. The scene was relatively tame compared to just over an hour earlier, when clashes between police and protesters led to several arrests in the same area. Roughly 45 arrests have been made in New York City this evening, a law enforcement source told CNN. “Democracy is under assault before our eyes, this moment we have feared has arrived,” he said. He urged the public to stand up for their democracy, but cautioned: “If you exercise your first amendment rights, please do it peacefully.” Johnson told reporters Tuesday that Newsom — who has aggressively criticized the Trump administration's moves — “ought to be tarred and feathered.” As protests continue in Los Angeles, about 700 Marines have been activated to help protect federal personnel and property. CNN speaks with LA residents to get their reactions. “Having troops in a civilian American neighborhood does not make anyone safer at all,” said resident Daniel Fabiano. Another resident, Priscilla Martinez, said: “I feel safe around the protests. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass' office shared a graphic of the borders of area impacted by the curfew in downtown Los Angeles. It will be in place from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. local time. Video from the anti-ICE protest tonight in New York City shows NYPD detaining multiple individuals. Several protesters can be seen on the ground as officers attempt to handcuff them. President Donald Trump in his response to protests invoked a rarely used law to federalize the National Guard over the objection of Democratic California Gov. Read CNN's Zachary B. Wolf's analysis on whether Trump can lawfully take control of California's national guard. The Marines, while mobilized, haven't yet been called in to respond. But to hear Trump tell it, his decision to call in the troops has made all the difference in putting down violent demonstrations. Democrats in a bind: Democrats are forced back onto politically perilous turf, as they look for ways to condemn his actions without being drawn into a broad debate over immigration or tying themselves to the chaotic scenes emerging from Los Angeles. Misinformation is rife: Offline, in real-world Los Angeles, most Angelenos are having a perfectly normal day. Trump defends decision: During a visit to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Trump defended sending the National Guard and the Marines to Los Angeles. David Huerta: A revered California labor leader, Huerta was arrested on Friday for his involvement in protests decrying immigration raids in Los Angeles. Demonstrators came out nationwide Monday to demand his release and after three nights of detention, Huerta was released on a $50,000 bond Monday afternoon. Immigration and Customs Enforcement posted images on X today of officers detaining individuals in Los Angeles while surrounded by National Guard troops, in what appears to be the first photos marking the Guard involved in ICE operations. The Trump administration deployed thousands of National Guard troops to California, casting it as a necessary move to quell protests in Los Angeles that erupted in a section of the city over ICE enforcement actions. Multiple sources told CNN the National Guard's focus while in Los Angeles was to protect property and personnel. Images shared by ICE on X show authorities arresting individuals, as troops stand by, appearing to guard the area around the operation — in other words, serving as security perimeter. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that troops are on the ground to provide protection from federal law enforcement officers and property. “If any rioters attack ICE law enforcement officers, military personnel have the authority to temporarily detain them until law enforcement makes the arrest. The violence against ICE law enforcement must end,” she said. Former senior ICE officials who spoke to CNN couldn't recall any time the National Guard had been involved in an ICE interior operation. Officials who enacted a curfew in parts of downtown Los Angeles assess that fewer than 100,000 of the city's nearly 4 million residents actually live within the zoned off area, a law enforcement source familiar said. Officials have stressed that nightly LA protests, which have at times turned violent, are typically relegated to a small portion of the downtown area.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>France said it has received a letter from the Palestinian Authority that contains “concrete and unprecedented commitments” to reform as Paris prepares to co-chair a conference on Palestinian statehood in New York. The letter, which France said was signed by Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas, includes condemnation of the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, a call on Hamas to immediately release all hostages, and pledges to hold elections and reform the authority, according to excerpts shared with CNN. “Hamas will no longer rule Gaza and must hand over its weapons and military capabilities to the Palestinian Security Forces, which will oversee their removal outside the occupied Palestinian territory, with Arab and international support,” the Élysée Palace cited Abbas as writing. The letter France says it received comes as anticipation builds around whether President Emmanuel Macron might recognize the State of Palestine at a summit next week aimed at building support for Palestinian statehood at the United Nations. France is co-chairing the summit with Saudi Arabia. France said Abbas pledged to organize presidential and general elections within a year in order to “rejuvenate the Palestinian governance.” He has led the PA since the death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in 2004 and has clung to power despite being seen by critics as lacking democratic legitimacy. Proposals put forth by Arab states for a post-war Gaza have excluded Hamas from governance and called for the reformation of the PA. The Guardian reported on Saturday that France may be retreating from its plan. However, an Élysée source told CNN that the French presidency refutes such reports, and that Paris is moving in the direction of recognizing a Palestinian state. “We can clearly see that some have an interest in suggesting that we are not moving in the direction of recognition. France would be the most prominent Western country to recognize Palestinian statehood. Last year, Spain, Ireland and Norway formally recognized the State of Palestine in a move that provoked backlash from Israel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. MICHAEL SINGH is Managing Director and Lane-Swig Senior Fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Since assuming office, U.S. President Donald Trump has overseen an unprecedented assault on the federal government. Initially, his agent in this campaign was the tech mogul Elon Musk, who was running the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. But precisely what a “new normal” should look like was hotly debated. Internationalists believed the United States should maintain a robust overseas role, while conservatives were skeptical of international intervention. From those debates emerged the U.S. national security state—the collection of government agencies and organizations that focus on protecting citizens from external threats. Thanks to its success winning the Cold War, the national security state has been treated almost as sacrosanct by the U.S. foreign policy establishment, with its logic and institutions going unchallenged and unchecked for decades. Ensuring U.S. national security in the future requires not simply reversing DOGE's cuts or restaffing various organizations but fighting for new compromises and considering new threats. In the aftermath of World War II, as communism and Soviet power spread abroad, the priority for American policymakers of all stripes was to defend the United States' democracy and its way of life. Yet there were two distinct views on how to accomplish this, and each side felt the other's proposed policies would bring about the very calamity they aimed to prevent. Internationalists believed that the United States had to cast off its historic caution overseas and take up the mantle of international leadership that had fallen in Washington's lap. This meant, among other things, building lasting alliances, sustaining a permanent military presence abroad, and preparing for what was anticipated to be “total war” of one great power against another. Conservatives were appalled at these ideas, which in their view ran counter to traditional American political culture, represented the very sort of European imperialism America's founders had rebelled against, and militarized U.S. society in a way that would erode democracy. Conservatives argued instead for focusing on domestic affairs, which had been relatively neglected during the war, and returning to an older approach to U.S. foreign policy—one that emphasized the Western Hemisphere and insisted on the reduction of defense budgets. In 1947, as President Harry Truman and his Secretary of State George Marshall peddled their proposal to provide billions of dollars in postwar reconstruction aid to Europe, Congressman Harold Knutson of Minnesota described the Marshall Plan as “tax-and-borrow-and-spend in other countries” and suggested the men were captive to the “intelligentsia, one-worlders, and do-gooders.” He derided supporters of the spending in his own party as “internationally-minded, ‘me-too' Republicans”—echoes of today's “RINO,” or Republican in name only, epithet. Internationalists returned the conservatives' scorn in full measure, arguing that their “Fortress America” would allow adversaries to prosper and accumulate power and that the United States could not survive as a democratic island in a communist and authoritarian world. As Truman asserted in sketching his eponymous doctrine in 1947, it would be the “policy of the United States to support free peoples,” and the United States had every intention of remaining a global and interventionist power. Despite his foreign policy leanings, Truman sought to reduce defense spending and restore balanced budgets—which were still considered an American tradition—and he stood firm against the most ambitious proposals coming from his administration, such as the unification of the military under an all-powerful commander or the institution of universal military training for Americans. To be sure, the resulting national security system had a strong internationalist bias. The newly formed National Security Council, for example, rejected proposals to include once dominant domestic cabinet agencies such as Agriculture and Commerce—but checks on its power were included in its design. Rather than a single consolidated structure, the national security state worked via committee and coordination. The CIA, for example, could not readily access domestic law enforcement information, nor could it participate in policy debates; and the secretary of defense received only a slim staff to allay concerns that the role would be too powerful. But if the national security state built after World War II was designed in part to accommodate conservative concerns about imperial overreach, that compromise quickly fell by the wayside. Each new body had a logic of its own, but each also pushed the United States further from its roots as a noninterventionist state. Yet that success carried significant costs, many of which were predicted by conservative commentators. Conservatives and self-professed realists had also warned that the internationalists' logic was a recipe for fruitless conflict. The political commentator Walter Lippmann, for example, thought that the policy of containment articulated by the U.S. diplomat George Kennan played to Soviet rather than American advantages: Lippmann wrote that Kennan's strategy meant that “Moscow, not Washington, would select the ground where the conflict was to be waged, and would choose the weapons.” Washington, he believed, would be drawn into conflicts by partners about whom it knew little and would ultimately be forced either to abandon them or to indefinitely defend them at enormous cost. Although Lippmann was wrong about the failure of the United States' Cold War strategy, warnings such as these proved prescient in Vietnam and elsewhere. Congressional conservatives made a brief comeback in the 1990s, under former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's leadership, but a full-throated debate over the national security state's merits still did not resume. Indeed, facing an urgent crisis, the administration of George W. Bush largely repurposed, strengthened, and expanded the existing national security state, with violent Islamist extremism standing in for communism. These sentiments became the mainstream Republican view with Trump's rise to power, which occurred in parallel with the emergence of think tanks devoted to isolationism or restraint, such as the Quincy Institute and Defense Priorities. The second Trump administration is arguably the first in which this faction of conservatives, a throwback to the days of Herbert Hoover and Robert Taft, have a major role in national security issues. After many years in exile, it should be little surprise that they have largely picked up where their political and intellectual predecessors left off and are now bringing the rest of the party with them. One-time internationalist hawks such as Rubio, for instance, are helping to lead the reorientation in U.S. foreign policy. In his first official remarks as secretary of state, he called for a greater emphasis on hemispheric issues and on internal security, and he has been eager to slash budgets and shrink the agencies he oversees, including the NSC, USAID, and the State Department. These priorities reflect a political tradition largely relegated to the fringes during the Cold War and the so-called war on terror, but one that remained alive, relevant to political debates, and deeply rooted in American society even when it was not dominant. Although its adherents are not monolithic in their views by any means, it is a tradition that differs from internationalism in that it views broad U.S. entanglement in international affairs as delivering more risk than reward, more cost than benefit. Mandatory outlays, which include social security, Medicare, and Medicaid, grew from 9.6 to 13.9 percent of GDP over that same period, as net interest on the U.S. debt grew from 2.0 to 2.4 percent of GDP. DOGE efforts, such as gutting USAID and the U.S. Institute of Peace, will not only fail to put a dent in this problem but ironically target spending that may be among the national security state's most efficient. For the cost of a couple of fighter jets, these agencies aim to prevent or slow the growth of conflicts and crises that, if left unaddressed, might become far more costly for the United States. These cuts also exacerbate a risk that used to alarm the sort of conservatives now in power in Washington: foreign partners may increasingly see the U.S. military as their most stable and effective counterpart in Washington. The unilateral imposition of tariffs is one example, but so is a more hierarchical method of crafting national security policy: presidential comments or social media posts, for example, have replaced the postwar bottom-up system. Although small-government conservatism and limits on the power of the presidency are as old as the Republic, this trend is newer and arguably began with conservative frustrations in the 1980s that President Ronald Reagan was hampered in his ability to carry out his agenda by a too-powerful Congress. Whatever the merits of Trump's campaign, the combined effect of an increase in presidential power and a dismantling of national security institutions means there will be ever-greater power concentrated in ever-fewer hands—the very outcome that postwar conservatives were determined to avert. For all the acrimony that has attended DOGE's scorched-earth campaign against the national security state and Trump's efforts to consolidate power in his own hands, the same degree of consensus exists today: there is near unanimity among national security experts regarding the futility of recent wars and the need to focus on nuclear-armed great-power rivals—namely, China and Russia. Differences among ideological factions regarding how to address those threats are sharp, but no more so than those in the immediate aftermath of World War II. It is worth remembering how those earlier debates led to compromises that produced a thoroughgoing reform of the bureaucracy that, while imperfect, served American needs at a critical time. For their part, modern-day internationalists should recognize that the national security system that won the Cold War is not sacrosanct but in need of reconsideration: it was designed for different threats in a different century, and its failings provide useful lessons for the current generation of policymakers. Merely reversing Trump's cuts and repurposing the old system for new threats—such as arguing that competition with China is a “new cold war”—is insufficient. Yet they are right that U.S. engagement in the world is more necessary than ever; any notion of retreating to our own hemisphere or carving the world into spheres of influence is nonsensical when facing adversaries with innumerable ways to cause the United States direct harm. And they are right that the nonmilitary tools of power are critical if war is to be avoided and peace won. The federal government must provide a home both to those with critical skills of the obscure sort—such as nuclear weapons scientists or pathogen researchers—and those with highly marketable expertise in emerging technologies. Newly triumphant traditional conservatives, meanwhile, are right that a slimmer national security state could serve U.S. interests better than the bloated structure that emerged from the Cold War and the war on terror. Just as in the aftermath of World War II, it is not in the single-minded pursuit of either side's vision that the United States will find success, but in achieving compromise between them. The Silicon Valley ethos embraced by DOGE is often described as “move fast and break things.” Washington's ethos, however, has often been described as “in crisis, opportunity.” The breaking of the national security state is indeed a crisis, but it also creates an opportunity for the Trump administration or its successors to finally build a new national security state tailored to the world's present-day threats as well as the United States' deep-rooted and disparate political traditions.

WASHINGTON, June 11. /TASS/. Moscow has given to Washington the roadmap on return of the de-facto confiscated Russian diplomatic property in the United States, Russia's new Ambassador to Washington Alexander Darchiev said in an interview with TASS, the first one since the start of his tenure on March 26.

"As part of the permanent mechanism of regular consultations on bilateral 'irritants,' where I lead the Russian delegation, a negotiation process has been launched about the return of the six Russian diplomatic property sites, de-facto confiscated in 2016-2018," he said. "The American side has been given a 'roadmap' with realistic timeframes and a demand to provide access to these sites for inspections and assessment of damage."

In 2017, the Russian Consulate General in San Francisco, the trade mission in Washington (both state-owned) and its branch in New York (rented premises) were closed due to anti-Russian sanctions. In 2018, Washington announced the closure of the Russian Consulate General in Seattle (rented premises), as well as the residence of the Consul General (diplomatic property). Russia reacted to the seizure of diplomatic property as an openly hostile act and called on the United States to immediately return these facilities.</p>
