                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Full House star Candace Cameron Bure has raised eyebrows after sharing a number of religious conspiracy theories. The devout Christian, 49, divided social media after sharing some of her more controversial views on a recent episode of her self-titled podcast. 'I don't even want someone watching a scary movie in our house on the TV because to me that's just a portal,' she explained. However, there's still something that can be incredibly demonic while they've made it,' she continued. 'I feel like it's a portal that gets opened up and let in.' The actress then turned her attention towards canned water brand Liquid Death. 'Do you want to buy a product that is literally being cursed as it's going out into distribution?' Full House star Candace Cameron Bure has raised eyebrows after sharing a number of religious conspiracy theories about horror movies and canned water Bure's son, Lev, who co-hosts the podcast with her, then admitted that he has even stricter boundaries than his pious mother. The episode drew a strong reaction on social media, with many accusing Bure of going too far with her beliefs. 'This is the most bats**t insane rhetoric I've ever heard,' commented one. 'The way none of these people bother to actually step up and call out real harm, violence and evil but will throw a fit about imaginary harm,' wrote another. A third added, 'Lmfao it's crazy to me that an adult is saying this. However, many others were supportive of the star. Someone gave my kid an ouija board and I told them to throw it away get it out of my house. I believe in anointing my home and praying to keep anything evil away,' wrote one. a second gushed, while another wrote, 'Speak on it! Another commented, 'I've always felt like this about scary movies. He has come to see it as I do now though.' Last year, Bure made headlines after sharing a video explaining how to 'vote like Jesus' in the 2024 Presidential election. The video, which was from Pastor Josh Howerton, suggested that it was 'completely unbiblical' for religious leaders not to comment on politics. 'Thirty million Bible-believing Christians abdicated their spiritual responsibility and did not vote in the last Presidential election. That last election was decided by a strategically placed 42,000 votes,' Howerton said in the sermon. The episode drew a strong reaction on social media, with many accusing Bure of going too far with her beliefs The showpiece drew some criticism for a banquet scene where an actor playing Greek god Dionysus took centre stage on a table with drag queens, which was interpreted to represent Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper. 'The Olympic Games have always brought me so much joy. She captioned the post: 'You asked me to make this shareable on story, so here it is. My take on the Olympic Games Opening Ceremony. 'Since posting, many have tried to correct me saying it wasn't about an interpretation of DaVinci's The Last Supper, but a Greek god and the festival of Dionysus; who is a god of lust, insanity, religious ecstasy, ritual madness etc. I still don't see how that relates to unifying the world through competitive sports and acceptable for children to watch.' She finished, 'In any case, I'm not buying it. I hope you'll listen all the way through. I won't stop praying and calling on Jesus' name.' By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leland Lehrman was named executive director last month of the MAHA Institute, an advocacy group advancing Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s priorities. Lehrman's appointment comes despite his extensive history of endorsing antisemitic fabrications, including a notorious false document that claims to reveal a secret Jewish plot, as well as advancing conspiracy theories that Israel's intelligence agency was responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The MAHA Institute, originating as a pro-Kennedy Super PAC, opposes vaccines and spreads COVID-19 conspiracies, with Lehrman leveraging insider knowledge of Kennedy's vaccine policies. Lehrman claimed that the protocols are likely genuine and characterized them as the most comprehensive exposure of Jewish supremacist ideology, suggesting they would trigger a significant political and historical realization. A recent analysis by a social justice watchdog group specializing in monitoring extremist and far-right activities exposes Lehrman's radical beliefs and indicates that his position at MAHA signals the movement's acceptance of antisemitic conspiracy narratives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're just 24 hours away from the premiere of SyFy's new horror series, Revival, and if its Rotten Tomatoes score is any indication of anything, it appears as if the show is going to be a big hit with fans. Based on the Image comics by Tim Seeley and Mike Norton, Revival debuted with a perfect 100%, with some calling it the best SyFy series since Chucky. "Arriving at a time when zombie stories are teetering on the brink between popular and overplayed, Revival benefits from an approach that doesn't take itself too seriously," said Gavia Baker-Whitelaw from TV Guide in their review. Clint Worthington from RogerEbert.com also had high praise for the series, highlighting its ensemble cast: These SYFY monster designs are some of the wackiest you will see in a horror movie. The series also stars Romy Weltman, David James Elliott, Andy McQueen, and WWE superstar CM Punk. "Revival does scratch the itch for viewers who want to see more of Scrofano on-screen, while also somewhat serving as a darker spiritual successor to Wynonna Earp in more ways than one," added Carly Lane from Collider. Sarah Fields from Tell-Tale TV was another who had high praise for Scrofano, saying: "Unlike many of its peers, Revival starts strong and only improves,” said Jarrod Jones from AC Club in his review, while Jennifer Griffin from TV Pulse mentioned that the series "plays with some interesting angles on the undead trope," though they do admit that it "struggles however is in its pacing." All-in-all, it appears as if Revival is going to be one of the summer's must-watch TV shows, and you can check it out when the first of its 10 episodes premieres tomorrow, June 12, on SyFy. Look for them to also stream on Peacock a week after their network debut, but be careful to avoid spoilers if you're going that route, as you'll always be seven days behind everyone else. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Fans still haven't given up hope that it can be saved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Local cop Melanie Scrofano gets a big scare while examining a dead body in a new Collider-exclusive sneak peek from the first episode of Revival. In addition to the dead rising from their graves in the new horror series, she's also dealing with a mysterious murder. It's a reunion between SyFy and Scrofano, who starred in the supernatural action series Wynonna Earp on the network for four seasons. ET; it will stream on Peacock next week. It's an icy night in the Wisconsin woods when small-town cop Dana Cypress (Scrofano) stops to investigate a dead animal by the side of the road. It shows no sign of life...but she gets the scare of her life when local fitness enthusiast Lester (Peter Millard) pops up behind her. He almost gives her a heart attack, but the Jack LaLanne-styled Lester thinks one could be in her future anyway unless she cuts out the trans fats. Further investigation turns up a dead fox in a trap...and what appears to be several human teeth. Dead bodies will be the least of Dana's problems in Revival, which is adapted from the Image Comics series of the same name by Tim Seely and Mike Norton. The event becomes known as "Revival Day" and attracts national attention; meanwhile, Dana is busy tracking down a murderer. In addition to Scrofano, the series also stars Romy Weltman (The Pradeeps of Pittsburgh) as Dana's daughter, Em; David James Elliott (JAG) as her father, Wayne; and Andy McQueen (Mrs. Davis) as Ibrahim Ramin. It also features recurring roles for Steven Ogg (The Walking Dead), Gia Sandhu (The Mysterious Benedict Society), Katherine King So (The Voyeurs), Maia Jae (Rabbit Hole), Nathan Dales (Letterkenny), Mark Little (Mr. D), Glen Gould (Tulsa King), Lara Jean Chorostecki (Hannibal), Conrad Coates (Fargo), and pro wrestler Phil "CM Punk" Brooks. Canadian actor Scrofano is best known for starring in the title role of SyFy's Wynonna Earp, which concluded with the Tubi-original special Wynonna Earp: Vengeance last year. She also starred on Letterkenny as gin-and-tonic enthusiast Mrs. McMurray, and will return as Captain Marie Batel on the upcoming third season of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The exchange of insults last week between Pakistan Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi was perhaps ordinary diplomatic sparring on the surface but more than quietly being an in-secret rebalancing of regional diplomacy. This dialogue is proof of a strategic re-think between Kabul and Islamabad on the connectivity of the region and shared economic interests. It is centered on the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) rail corridor project—a game-changing corridor that will redefine the economic and geopolitics of Central and South Asia. The bilateral Pakistan-Afghanistan relationship has been war-, suspicion-, and security-narrative-oriented so far. Both countries are eager to experiment with a more pragmatic relationship founded not on ideology or security but mutual strategic and economic interests. The UAP railroad is one actual platform for that change. It's a simple but persuasive idea: construct a fast, efficient, and inexpensive transportation route that reduces trade friction and opens up new economic opportunities for the three nations. To Central Asian landlocked nations, UAP line presents a worthy substitute for the conventional northward directions through Russia. This change of focus also aligns with a larger tendency in international politics, insofar as states increasingly seek cooperation based on converging economic interests, not ideological compatibility. The UAP project aligns with such thinking in promoting connectivity instead of confrontation. It does so in attempting to replicate a form of “functional institutionalism” for regional cooperation on infrastructure, trade, and logistics. Afghanistan, long perceived as instability and uncertainty, is instead being repackaged as not a hinderance but a transit necessity—central to the corridor's success, and regional stability more broadly. When Foreign Minister Dar traveled to Kabul in April 2025, talks focused on outlining the parameters of UAP. The latest follow-up phone call is evidence of continuity of purpose, and this would suggest that both sides recognize long-term benefit in entrenching cooperation. These developments also coincide with growing regional investment interest from China in developing infrastructure, notably as part of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Although the UAP railway is not officially a BRI project, its strategic needs are extremely complementary to China's master plan of regional integration and therefore makes it even more geopolitically relevant. Albeit in words, assurances notwithstanding, Pakistan cannot be sure the Taliban-infested regime would be in a position to contain militancy, especially from groups such as the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). While Islamabad, Kabul, and Tashkent converge towards each other, India risks being left behind in a growing connectivity matrix. As Turkiye and China have been developing deepening regional interests, Indian passive strategy can turn into isolation unless India reaffirms engagement with its neighbors in a positive way. It offers a forum on which economic realism can replace decades of political rigidity. The corridor does create a form of interdependency, however, that, if well managed, can cut across the political pendulum swings and ideology swings of its member states. This is making way for more integrated diplomacy between both of them, an arena where infrastructure is crafted as a dialogue and stability tool and not necessarily development. As the UAP railway project moves ever more rapidly ahead and new efforts at diplomatic normalisation are underway, a new day can be viewed to be on the horizon for Central and South Asia. A time when geography no longer means fate, but opportunity—when diplomacy flows not merely through embassies and communiqués, but through corridors linking countries, markets, and peoples together. If they are preserved, the UAP railway can also easily become a symbol of what regional cooperation can achieve in an increasingly dominated world by infrastructure and interdependence. Pakistan's finance minister promised “strategic direction” and the FY26 Budget has a coherent thought process towards that aim. similar comments u have read about Pak Air Force, from some Indian writer. Nowhere Pakistan has claimed it aspired to be blue water navy. The average Pakistani wants to live in peace and harmony.</p>

This newly discovered relative of Tyrannosaurus rex came to light after researchers re-examined fossils found in Mongolia. Their findings were published Wednesday (June 11) in the journal Nature. Tyrannosauroids were giant apex predators that walked on two legs, had huge heads with sharp teeth and tiny arms. They are part of the larger tyrannosauroid family and were thought to have evolved from smaller species — but until now there has been little fossil evidence to support this idea. So, Voris set out for Mongolia to examine partial tyrannosauroid skeletons that had been excavated decades ago but not yet fully examined. Related: Dinosaurs might still roam Earth if it weren't for the asteroid, study suggests Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. "Many of us in the palaeontology community knew that these Mongolian fossils were lurking in museum drawers, waiting to be studied properly, and apt to tell their own important part of the tyrannosaur story," Steve Brusatte, a palaeontologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Edinburgh, U.K., who wasn't involved in the research, told Live Science. But after being reexamined, "I realized it was something completely different than anything we'd ever seen," Voris said. The dragon prince lived 86 million years ago and looked much like a tyrannosaur, but it was only about 13 feet (4 meters) long, weighing in at 1,650 pounds (750 kilograms). Many later tyrannosaurs were much bigger, with T. rex reaching 41 feet (12.5 m) long and weighing up to about 23,000 pounds (10,400 kg). The dragon prince also had a smaller head and longer arms compared to later tyrannosaurs. Voris thinks the specimens are small adult individuals, rather than young dinosaurs. He identified a slew of features that are indicators of maturity, including fused-up vertebrae, prominently developed small horns and the nasal bone having a wrinkled texture. "It was probably taking down prey smaller than itself," Zelenitsky told Live Science. "It shows that tyrannosaurs were still relatively small at this time, and only later did they become colossal." The researchers also compared 12 species of tyrannosaurs to figure out when and where they lived, how they were related, and when any migrations might have taken place. They found that, about 85 million years ago, K. mongoliensis, or a closely related species, migrated out of Asia into North America across a land bridge where the Bering Strait is now and gave rise to the first true tyrannosaurs. —'Exquisitely preserved' ginormous claws from Mongolia reveal strange evolution in dinosaurs —166 million-year-old fossil found on Isle of Skye belongs to pony-size dinosaur from Jurassic This resulted in the evolution of two tyrannosaur subgroups in Asia: huge ones weighing several tons like Tarbosaurus bataar, and smaller, slim ones such as Qianzhousaurus sinensis, which was nicknamed "Pinocchio rex" because of its small size and long snout. During a third migration, about 68 million years ago, one of the giant tyrannosaur species from Asia traveled back to North America and probably gave rise to T. rex, Zelenitsky said. "They show that a few big migration events back and forth between Asia and North America were the drivers of much of tyrannosaur evolution," Brusatte said. "The tyrannosaur family tree was shaped by migration, just like so many of our human families."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Institute is coming soon to MGM+. The series, ordered in June 2024, will arrive next month. A preview and several photos have been released for the series. Everyone brought there has special powers. Mary-Louise Parker, Ben Barnes, Joe Freeman, Simone Miller, Fionn Laird, Hannah Galway, Julian Richings, Robert Joy, and Martin Roach star in the series. “From executive producers Stephen King and Jack Bender (FROM), The Institute follows the story of teen genius Luke Ellis (Freeman), who is kidnapped and awakens at The Institute, a facility full of children who all got there the same way he did and who are all possessed of unusual abilities. In a nearby town, haunted former police officer Tim Jamieson (Barnes) has come looking to start a new life, but the peace and quiet won't last, as his story and Luke's are destined to collide.” Do you plan to watch this new series on MGM+?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Image of a radio telescope located at the Green Bank Observatory. This is what a recent study published in The Astronomical Journal hopes to address as a team of researchers investigated how machine learning could be used to search for extraterrestrial technosignatures while simultaneously identifying radio contamination from human radio signals. This study has the potential to help radio astronomers develop more efficient methods in searching for and identifying radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations. The study was led by Snir Pardo from the School of Physics and Astronomy at Tel-Aviv University in Israel, whose team collaborated with the Breakthrough Listen project to obtain spectrograms from more than 300 stars less than 50 parsecs (163 light-years) from Earth. What makes this study unique is the researchers used a combination of computer models and machine learning algorithms to analyze the data with the goal of identifying candidate signals that could originate from an extraterrestrial technosignature and not from a human source radio signal. We leveraged a minimal set of assumptions and simple operations, in order to search efficiently for technosignatures in radio observations of nearby stars. Future work should explore incorporating adaptive multiscale techniques to further automate the vetting process and expand search efficiency." The Breakthrough Listen project is an astronomy project whose goal is to identify technosignatures of radio and laser communications using the aforementioned Parkes Observatory and Green Bank Observatory while being based at the Berkeley SETI Research Center. While no confirmed technosignatures have yet to be received by scientists on Earth, the closest humanity has come to receiving a signal from another world happened August 15, 1977. Despite several attempts to obtain a similar signal from its supposed origin of the constellation Sagittarius, astronomers couldn't find another signal like it and have yet to receive anything close to the intensity of this original signal. This study demonstrates how the SETI Institute continues to broaden its methods for using radio astronomy in searching for and identifying radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations, noted as technosignatures here. Aside from using radio astronomy to search for technosignatures, the goal of SETI is to broaden our understanding of searching for life beyond Earth through collaborations on active and retired space missions, including Cassini, New Horizons, Opportunity, Curiosity, Kepler, and TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite). As machine learning continues to advance, so will its ability to potentially identify technosignatures from outside Earth and demonstrate that we might not be alone in the universe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the 19-year-old keeps a low profile at college and is said to be happily dating someone who shares his love for privacy, the internet has spun an entirely different story. From a bizarre viral video claiming he is “secretly married” to WNBA superstar Caitlin Clark, to an AI-generated deepfake linking him romantically with Spanish royal Princess Leonor, Barron has become unexpected tabloid bait. “Barron has a really nice girlfriend and hangs out with her a lot,” an insider told NewsNation, noting that the relationship appears serious and intentionally kept under wraps. Despite having secret service agents nearby at all times, Barron has managed to carve out a modest social life, including dating. “Anyone who says otherwise doesn't understand how this works.” While it may not be ideal for a teenager looking for normalcy, insiders insist that Barron's relationship has not been hindered. Though he has been previously speculated to have dated TikToker @maddatitude, that rumor was largely debunked — she never applied to NYU, and her social media-forward lifestyle doesn't align with Barron's extremely private nature. “He's not trying to be the big man on campus,” said a fellow NYU student, adding that Barron is far more like his mother than his headline-grabbing father. When his enrollment was first reported, reactions were mostly supportive. “He didn't choose this life,” one student told the Daily Mail. Even though AI fantasies and fabricated marriage theories continue to swirl online, the real Barron Trump seems focused on something far more relatable: building a quiet, meaningful connection — and trying to live a normal college life, one that's anything but ordinary when you're a Trump.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>THR goes inside a book launch party for Day's latest book, ‘The Prism,' hosted by Kevin Huvane and Oscar nominee Demi Moore at the home of the CAA power player on a recent May evening. Kevin Huvane, one of Hollywood's most powerful and respected agents, happened to be in New York City about 32 years ago with client and friend Demi Moore when the movie star suggested an introduction to someone “really, really special” in her life. “You had already had Rumer and I met her already,” Huvane recalled, referencing the eldest of Moore's three daughters with ex-husband Willis. Billy Bob Thornton Says He Didn't Expect 'Landman' to Be "This Successful" and Teases Season 2 “I fell in love with Laura Day that night,” Huvane said on a recent May evening while holding a microphone and standing next to Day and Moore on the back patio of his stunning Beverly Hills property with sweeping views of the entire city of Los Angeles. “From that moment on, she became part of our trio.” That three had good reason to reunite that night because in addition to her aforementioned titles, Day is also a New York Times best-selling author. Huvane opened his home to celebrate the publication of her latest tome titled The Prism: Seven Steps to Heal Your Past and Transform Your Future. Published by Spiegel & Grau, the book follows her other efforts Practical Intuition, Practical Intuition in Love, Practical Intuition for Success, The Circle, Welcome to Your Crisis and How to Rule the World From Your Couch. The Prism, described as part memoir and part self-help guide to overhauling one's life, is dedicated to “the four corners of my reality” including her writer-producer husband Stephen Schiff (The Americans), “son and sun” Samson Day, “exegete” Herschel Goldfield and Huvane, whom she dubbed “my rock.” During his brief introduction, Huvane noted how Day wanted to write a book and Moore helped push it along, even suggesting that she promote it on Oprah Winfrey's beloved daytime talk show. The anecdote caused Day to interject, “You stole my story.” Without missing a beat, Huvane quipped, “You should have known that.” The crowd — filled with actors (Lucy Hale, Jurnee Smollett), comedians (Tig Notaro, Jack Whitehall), power players (Greg Berlanti, Robbie Rogers), agents (CAA's Tracy Brennan, Jaime Feld, Ryan Abboushi), Housewives (Kyle Richards, Erika Jayne) and authors (Gregg Hurwitz) — ate it up. Despite joking about Day's ability to see the future, Huvane did say he hates the word psychic and much prefers intuitive. “The Prism is one of those things where you read this book, work it and it will change your life,” he praised. With that, Huvane handed the microphone over to Moore who then detailed just how close she's been to Day over the decades. “Laura is one of if not my oldest friend. “Laura has been given and was born with an incredible gift. But what's different about Laura than others who may share in similar gifts is that she has taken the time to hone her gift — to find a way to take what she was naturally given and make it targeted and precise and utilize that for her day job with Fortune 500 companies.” Moore said Day passes that knowledge along in The Prism and she suggested that the guests at the party pick up a copy on their way home and find a small cluster of friends to workshop the book together “to share in an experience and work together truly in community” to transform “to even higher and greater states.” It was a quite an endorsement from Moore, who looked glowing and relaxed at the celebration as it was filled with friends and fellow industry insiders. She and Huvane then looked on with wide smiles as Day took the microphone and read prepared remarks that began with another sidestep around the term psychic. It takes a lot of courage to say, ‘This weirdo is one of my people,' so a blanket thank you to all of you who have done just that by being here tonight.” She then credited a group of researchers for helping firm up what would one day become her livelihood. “I didn't know over 40 years ago when I stumbled into a group of researchers who were interested in extrasensory perception that my unhealthy neurology — the brain that refused to remember the periodic table or what year it was but could travel around in space and time — would become my career. Since I don't know who the co-star is, they can check it out and see if I'm right about that. But I really only work for people who know what they're doing anyway — A VC firm, producers, studios, people who know what they're doing. If I called my book The Ego, well, no one wants to come to a party celebrating that, but you need an ego. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>
