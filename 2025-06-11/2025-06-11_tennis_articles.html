                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stephens hails the WTA's new fertility protection rule as a game-changer for women athletes The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has introduced a new rule allowing female players to take time off for fertility preservation procedures, like egg or embryo freezing, without sacrificing their place on tour. The regulation extends the association's growing support for women balancing career and family, following its earlier policy of offering up to 12 months of paid maternity leave. The WTA said in a statement, ‚ÄúThe new rule means that players can now take time away from professional tennis for a fertility protection procedure such as egg or embryo freezing and safely return to competition with a protected ranking.‚Äù This can be used to enter up to three tournaments within ten weeks of return, though not for top-tier events. Players who are ranked between 1 and 750 in singles or doubles and who are out of competition for at least 10 weeks in a row due to a ‚Äúfertility protection procedure‚Äù are eligible. The new rule will be open to any player ranked in the world's top 750 who spends more than 10 weeks out of competition üéæüÜï pic.twitter.com/A51JttFT9N Sloane Stephens, 2017 US Open champion, praised the policy as ‚Äúgroundbreaking.‚Äù A longtime advocate, Stephens revealed she's undergone egg freezing twice during the off-season. So having the protected ranking there, so that players don't feel forced to come back early and risk their health again, is the best thing possible.‚Äù She also said, ‚ÄúThe WTA has now created a safe space for players to explore options and to make the best decisions for themselves.‚Äù Further, the WTA confirmed that through its Maternity Fund, backed by the Saudi Public Investment Fund, financial grants will now help players afford fertility treatment. ü§∞üéæ Female players who choose to undergo a fertility protection procedure will be allowed to take time away from the sport and return to competitive action with a protected ranking, the governing body of women's tennis (WTA) said on Wednesday. Since 2019, mothers have been allowed to use their prior ranking in up to 12 tournaments within three years of giving birth. The WTA introduces the Fertility Protection Special Entry Ranking Rule.The new rule means players can take time away from tennis for a fertility protection procedure such as egg or embryo freezing and safely return to competition with a protected ranking.Great development!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former runner-up Daniil Medvedev and former champion Adrian Mannarino will headline Day 4 of the ATP 250 in Den Bosch, with both players clashing for a place in the next round. Their match is among several exciting encounters as we approach the quarterfinal stage. We at LWOT offer our predictions on who will make it through. He will look to continue his fine form against Nuno Borges, a player with whom he has traded wins. 1 looking to impact grass, expect a lengthy encounter full of strategic rallies as each player strives to gain dominance. Virtanen's strong serve will earn points, whereas Borges will aim to make the most of return games, maintain consistency, and take advantage of the quicker grass surface. Give me the Finn to keep his solid momentum going on green. Alexei Popyrin's bid to enter the world's top 20 for the first time kicks off with his first appearance on grass. The Belgian narrowly defeated his fellow countryman Alexander Blockx in a closely fought three-setter in the opener, and if he brings that performance into this encounter against the big-serving Aussie, there won't be an upset. Former finalist Daniil Medvedev will be pleased to have overcome his clay court struggles as he begins his grass season against former champion Adrian Mannarino. The Russian openly expressed his dislike for clay and has gradually evolved into a strong competitor on grass. Despite his pedigree, he faces a challenging opener against lucky loser, Adrian Mannarino, who trounced Christopher O'Connell 6-1 6-3 in the previous round. Their most recent clash on grass was at Wimbledon two years ago, where the world no. However, this will not be an easy win, even though he should eventually advance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>COCO GAUFF is quickly squeezing in the taste of glory while she still can. The new French Open champ served up a treat for herself as she returned to the USA for brief downtime ahead of Wimbledon. And what better way to unwind than taking in a game with your favorite children's snack? The American looked happy to share her sweet secret court-side as she watched New York Liberty take on Chicago Sky in the WNBA at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Cool Coco was chic but casual - wearing a blue bomber-style jacket, ripped back jeans and New Balance sneakers. An infinity chain topped off her fashionable appearance. Her carb-high snack might intrigue some observers in these days of rigorous diet and training programs for elite athletes. Likewise, popping back from Europe to the US before Wimbledon might also be seen as unusual. But it all suggests Gauff enjoys a healthy balance between a supreme regime of fitness and occasionally letting her hair down. Gauff was also presented with a "25" Liberty shirt by their 27-year-old icon Sabrina Ionescu after they sunk Chicago 85-66. She now has two Slams to her name, having also won the 2023 US Open. Now Gauff will be confident of producing her best-ever run at Wimbledon. But doing so three times already at her tender age - in 2019, 2021 and last year - indicates she can be a consistent title threat for a decade or more. Meanwhile, Gauff was "surprised" to hear World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka say the duo played "terrible tennis" in the Roland Garros final. The beaten Belarusian hit 70 unforced errors and called Saturday's windy conditions a "joke" as Gauff battled back to triumph 6-7 6-2 6-4. "In these tough conditions, you were a better player than me. And it should be easy for Gauff to deal with - as she loves things that are both sweet and sour!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The event will be played across two days on ‚Äòfan week' with a unique rule set that may take some getting used to. 16 teams will compete in the tournament, eight of which will qualify through their combined singles rankings on the ATP and WTA Tours. These changes have received mixed reviews, although it sounds like the player support is there, with many big names expected to sign up when tennis heads to New York in August. One top WTA star has now responded when asked if she plans to play the event alongside her ATP Tour fianc√©e later this year. During an interview ahead of the 2025 Queen's Club Championships, British number one Katie Boulter was asked whether she plans to play the US Open mixed doubles event with Alex de Minaur. I don't think we have ruled it out, but I don't think we have had a conversation about it. ‚ÄúSo, whereas all other tournaments, singles, doubles, you have a three-week entry deadline, and you have to do it before then. De Minaur and Boulter have already played mixed doubles together, competing at the invitational Eisenhower Cup event at Indian Wells earlier this year. Only time will tell if we will see Boulter and De Minaur return to the United States for some more mixed doubles action later in the year. Andrea Vavassori and Sara Errani, the defending US Open mixed doubles champions, expressed their disappointment in a social media post. ‚ÄúIn the last few weeks, we received the news that the US Open mixed doubles tournament will be completely turned upside down, cancelled, and replaced with a pseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show,‚Äù they said in a joint statement. ‚ÄúA decision made without consulting anyone, which we can do nothing but accept. We see it as a profound injustice that disrespects an entire category of players. Putting money above tennis is never a good idea. ‚ÄúWe don't know at the moment if we'll have the chance to defend our title, but we hope this will remain an isolated case and this type of policy will not be considered again in the future. We strongly felt the need to share our thoughts, Sara & Andrea.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt's not as if I don't feel bad. Some of my best friends in the world [are doubles players],‚Äù said Roddick. ‚ÄúBut the arguments have to be based on fact or a new idea. You can't just use vague terms like we are not promoted. It's an old product that everyone knows about, which nobody watches. ‚ÄúI don't know if it will work, but it's something different to try opposed to just letting something bleed out.‚Äù</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Women's tennis players will now received protected rankings during periods where they undergo fertility treatment, according to a new announcement. The WTA, the sport's governing body broke new ground in March when they announced that they would be ensuring that their players would be eligible to receive maternity pay and 'comprehensive benefits' thanks to a new initiative between the organisation and their partner the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF). An estimated 320 players on the women's tour became eligible for paid maternity leave of up to 12 months under the new regulations, as well as grants for fertility treatments, such as egg freezing, and additional benefits. But the WTA have now extended their PIF WTA Maternity Fund Program to ensure that players undergoing egg or embryo freezing do not see their rankings under fire amid potentially seismic physical change. Former US Open champion Sloane Stephens shared her outspoken support of the programme as she opened up on her own experience of undergoing the challenges of playing through recovery. 'The first time I did it, I rushed back and I was overweight and not happy - and just very stressed out,' Stephens told the BBC, sharing that she had undergone treatment twice during the off-season. 'So having the protected ranking there, so that players don't feel forced to come back early and risk their health again, is the best thing possible.' 'It's all trial and error, everyone's body is different. Protected rankings are also available for players during pregnancy and postpartum for up to three years after giving birth. Although these protected rankings predate PIF's involvement with WTA, as independent contractors, female tennis stars have had few other financial protections when taking time out from the tour. Eventual winner of the tournament Coco Gauff admitted that she had been 'concerned' when the location of the Finals had been announced, and that she had spent time talking to women in Saudi Arabia to discuss human rights issued ahead of participating. With the Finals set to be staged in Riyadh for at least two more years, Gauff was also open that her participation would not be guaranteed if she qualified. 'If I felt uncomfortable or it felt like nothing's happening, then I probably wouldn't come back,' the former US Open champion added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff is celebrating her 2025 French Open victory with a few surprise appearances around New York City. Gauff received a standing ovation when she made a surprise appearance on a Tuesday night episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Fallon celebrated by holding an audience vote on whether Gauff is "one of the greatest athletes living today," which received a unanimous thumbs-up. Gauff also made an appearance at a Tuesday night WNBA game between the Chicago Sky and New York Liberty, where she again received a standing ovation from the crowd at Barclays Center. "That was insane," Gauff said about the ovation during a mid-game interview with ESPN. "I wasn't expecting everyone to stand up. It just feels so cool to come back to such a warm reception." She was then filmed visiting the Liberty locker room after the home team celebrated Gauff's first WNBA game by claiming an 85-66 win over the Sky. The 21-year-old took on Sabalenka again at Roland Garros, where she recovered from an early deficit to win 6-7(5), 6-2, 6-4 last Saturday in Paris. Gauff is the first American woman to win the French open since Serena Williams in 2015, and the youngest woman to win multiple Grand Slam titles on different surfaces since Maria Sharapova in 2006.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coming down from high of Sunday's French Open final  ‚Ä¶ Andy and I will be back to regular episodes and then we'll do our Wimbledon draw show in two weeks. In the meantime, another thanks‚Äîperiodically offered; but always felt‚Äîfor your listenership/viewership. Jon, what was your favorite part of Sunday's wild and wonderful men's final? Not only did it seldom drop, but often both players were at their peaks simultaneously‚Äîjust a breathtaking display of tennis. Go back and watch that tiebreak‚Äîthe last eight or so minutes of the match. He had already lost the first set in multiple matches. But to lose the first two? Numerous hours later he served for the title at 5‚Äì4. And five minutes after standing on the threshold of victory, he was serving simply to stay in the match? Then Alcaraz won that game and (shoutout to Martina Navratilova for this observation in real time) he then felt unburdened and dominated the match tiebreak. 3) Sinner actually won more points‚Äîbefitting a match this close‚Äî193 to 192. In fact, he doubled only twice the entire tournament! (A discussion point‚Äîand I will ask Darren Cahill this‚Äîdoes that mean Sinner is eerily accurate? Or that he perhaps should go for more on his serves?) But chapeau tip to Eva Asderaki, the chair umpire. The players not only didn't complain, but they both conceded points and spared her trips down from the chair. There were no dubious bathroom breaks. This was breathtaking tennis married with impeccable sportsmanship. On the topic of pet peeves, is it possible to resurrect the correct term ‚Äúrunner-up‚Äù? Both he and Alcaraz were the finalists. And what do you say we put ‚Äúlucky loser‚Äù out of its misery while we're here? Thank you for your wonderful French Open coverage. 2025: Novak Djokovic, 38 years old, getting to the FO semis (very expected). 1991: Jimmy Connors, 39 years old, getting to the US Open semis (a total surprise run)‚Ä¶both at almost the same age. ‚Ä¢ Good week for Team Carlos A! Connors made that run to the semifinals at 39 years old in 1991 and it's a national story, prompting anti-aging jokes etc. Djokovic makes a run to the semis in 2025 and we ask: Can he win Wimbledon? The infusion of wealth that enables players to hire teams and fly private. It stands to reason that each generation will play longer than the one before it, learning from their missteps, availing themselves of greater technology, etc. (Notice that Djokovic needed weeks, not months‚Äînever mind years‚Äîto return from knee surgery last summer.) But, also, let's not sell Djokovic short. His professionalism, commitment and will is perhaps singular. Is it just me, or are tennis fans around the world disappointed at [Aryna] Sabalenka's remarks after losing to [Coco] Gauff at the French Open? To say that Coco lost because she made so many unforced errors and not because Coco played well, and to add insult to injury say that Coco would have lost to [Iga] ≈öwiƒÖtek had ≈öwiƒÖtek defeated Sabalenka in the semifinal match, notwithstanding the fact that Coco defeated ≈öwiƒÖtek 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì1 in their last clay court match, was not only in poor taste, it says a lot about Sabalenka as a person. I think Coco handled the remarks well in her response. ‚Ä¢ Here's where I stand on Sabalenka: Her return from the yips to winning majors is one of the great sports accomplishments. She has gone from see-ball, hit-ball erratic to a reliable late-round habitue. If we like the unfiltered personality and the absence of talking points‚Äîand we do‚Äîwe must consider that sometimes there's a flipside to brutal, unmediated candor. C) When athletes speak or act immediately after competition, it calls for grace. Roger Federer crying on Rafael Nadal's shoulder. In 1995, Steffi Graf won the title, stood before the crowd, smiled ‚Ä¶ and then forgot her French and said, ‚ÄúMon chapeau est bien.‚Äù (My hat is good.) We need to extend grace here. When Sabalenka stood with the runner-up, er, finalist, trophy and declared her play ‚Äúterrible,‚Äù it might not have been the epitome of grace. (And she did have all those errors. No one is arguing her level dropped in the final, though one would also think the opponent had a causal connection in that drop.) D) Here's where she lost the room and plot. After a cooldown period‚Äîwhen she had time to gather her thoughts and emotions‚Äîshe went to the press conference and doubled down, continuing not only to denigrate her performance and offer scant praise to the winner, and even take these potshots. ‚ÄúI think she won the match not because she played incredible, just because I made all of those mistakes.‚Äù Then there was this: ‚ÄúI mean, honestly, sometimes it felt like she was hitting the ball from the frame. Calling an opponent ‚Äúlucky‚Äù is weak. Especially when said opponent won 119 points. How many of those were frame jobs or lobs that, unexpectedly, landed in? Then, weirdly, she volunteered that Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek would have beaten Gauff. E) Never mind that fans were upset. No shade to Iga or anything, but last time I played her I won in straight sets. I don't think that's a fair thing to say, because anything can really happen.‚Äù None of us should be judged by our worst day. Her postmatch postmortem Saturday was unsporting and ungracious. She deserved to be called out. One hopes she doesn't lose her cork-popping personality. And when she wins Wimbledon next month, we'll all look at this, chuckling, the way we looked at her tossing rackets in the dustbin in the 2023 U.S. Open cooldown room. At the risk of being canceled ‚Ä¶ Sabalenka made 70 unforced errors‚Äî70!‚Äîin three sets and was still in a position to win. Dare I say if a male player made that many errors in three sets he would have been dusted in straight sets. But I don't know about that. If you're dusted in a best-of-three match, you're not in a position to commit 70 errors. 2‚Äìranked opponent ‚Ä¶ who played with a singular ability to prolong points ‚Ä¶ forcing the opponent to go for smaller margins ‚Ä¶ in a high-stakes match which amplified pressure ‚Ä¶ with lots of games going to deuce ‚Ä¶ with some ungenerous stats-keeping ‚Ä¶ strictly as a hypothetical, I can see it happening. I was watching the French Open final today with [well-regarded former NBA player] and his family‚Äîgood thing too because they never would have figured out the fifth set super tiebreaker. ‚Ä¢ A) Anyone else notice the rapturous roar followed by whaaaa when Alcaraz won his seventh point. This is not a conventional tiebreaker. Gradually we'll get accustomed to that. B) Kudos to the four majors. It's not a crapshoot and the sample size is up from best-of-seven. But it spares us the absurdity of winning by a two-game margin. I have been a long-time reader of your excellent mailbag (since approximately 1998). I also listen to the Served podcast. I am a Canadian who emigrated from Russia back in 1995. I know that in both mailbag and podcast settings, you are now staying quite apolitical. However, your suggestion that USTA should pursue Victoria Mboko representing the US is remarkably tone-deaf, at least to your Canadian readers. Threats to Canadian sovereignty from your current leader have significantly altered the political landscape in Canada, resulting in one of the most remarkable turnarounds in political history. At some point, the ongoing political climate in the US is bound to catch up with what you and Andy are covering. I'd take that back if given a second serve. To be clear, I am anti-jingoist. Federations subsidize players on the condition they switch nationality. Fans root for players, not the flags next to their names. My point: As long as we are now in a world where countries and federations pick off players and nationality are fungible, the USTA might as well get in the game. (Imagine a Billie Jean King Cup composed of all the players with a base in Florida and California.) But, taking a radical political stance, I'm documented Team Sovereignty. Random mailbag Q, inspired by [Andre] Agassi and [Jim] Courier on the TNT desk and which you might be able to learn given your access: Do ex-players ever get on the court and compete in private, ala the end of "Rocky 3" when Rocky and Apollo get into a ring at an empty gym?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plus: What can we expect from some second-week finishers at Wimbledon?ByJoel DruckerPublished Jun 11, 2025 copy_link Winning is the desired outcome that we can't control. But as Gauff has repeatedly demonstrated, competing is the process that one can hold ownership of every single minute.Gauff's forehand and serve have inspired enough dialogue to trigger a decade-long teaching conference. Put that aside and let us now praise her career-long superpower: No one in tennis competes better than Gauff. On an extremely blustery day, Tracy Austin lost the first set of the 1981 US Open final to a powerful opponent, Martina Navratilova, 6-1. From there, Austin dug in, won the next two sets in tiebreakers and, like Gauff, earned her second Grand Slam singles title.The asset that carried Austin to that victory was the same one that worked for Gauff: positive body language and keen mental focus, as she went about the business of solving one problem after another.

The asset that carried Austin to that victory was the same one that worked for Gauff: positive body language and keen mental focus, as she went about the business of solving one problem after another. Today, playing Aryna, I was just, like, ‚ÄòI just gotta go for it and try my best to get through the match.' ‚ÄúObviously I think the first [Grand Slam singles title] was maybe more emotional,‚Äù said Gauff, ‚Äúbut I think this one was just harder because, you know, you win one, and you just don't want to get satisfied with just that one‚Ä¶Today, playing Aryna, I was just, like, ‚ÄòI just gotta go for it and try my best to get through the match.' For surely, a positive attitude like Gauff's can be learned, can't it? And while she brings her own distinct temperament into competition, Gauff was also taught such values as grit, poise and grace by her parents, and was therefore open to learning yet more from others.To earn the title in Paris, Gauff also beat the winners of the last two majors, Australian Open champion Madison Keys and US Open titlist Sabalenka. Knowing that could further boost Gauff's confidence as she heads to Wimbledon‚Äîthe Slam where Gauff first hit the pro radar six years ago, but also the only major where she's never gone past the round of 16. There are those who say that the ability to compete effectively cannot be taught. For surely, a positive attitude like Gauff's can be learned, can't it?

Knowing that could further boost Gauff's confidence as she heads to Wimbledon‚Äîthe Slam where Gauff first hit the pro radar six years ago, but also the only major where she's never gone past the round of 16. Gauff won her second Grand Slam final over Aryna Sabalenka, again rallying from a set down to lift the trophy. The good news for Sabalenka is that she's reached seven singles finals this season, including each of the year's first two majors. Fair enough, as it's plausible to treat such an outcome as a one-off.But at Roland Garros, Sabalenka lost the battle in a far more emotional and tactical manner. From the minute she began to see her first set lead of 4-1, 40-love unravel, much of the old, highly temperamental Sabalenka surfaced. Give the mental progress she's made in recent years, it was a disturbing sight to see how a choice to be so agitated concurrently triggered ill-informed tactical decisions.As one example, Sabalenka lost so much faith in her approach-volley sequence that she hit drop shots far more than viable‚Äîa fatal tactic versus an opponent as fast as Gauff (even more so on a windy day, when it's that much harder to calibrate a drop shot's placement). And though she rallied well to level the third set and even earn a break point when Gauff served for the title at 5-4 in the third, Sabalenka was repeatedly unable to effectively blend power and accuracy.

Aryna Sabalenka, in a statement posted to social media As for Wimbledon, Sabalenka has twice reached the semis there. Yet eager as Sabalenka is to move forward, instead of tossing what happened at Roland Garros into a trash bin, might she study what happened: This was a defeat triggered to some degree by the negative energy she projected through most of this match. Soon after came such unsporting Sabalenka remarks about how terribly she'd played, giving minimal credit to how Gauff had broken up her game.I think she won the match not because she played incredible,‚Äù Sabalenka said, ‚Äújust because I made all of those mistakes from‚Äîlike, if you look from the outside, kind of like from easy balls.‚ÄùWith a day to reflect, Sabalenka put out an Instagram post apologizing for her comments.

With a day to reflect, Sabalenka put out an Instagram post apologizing for her comments. Considering how distraught Iga Swiatek has appeared for much of 2025, her semifinal run at Roland Garros was, if not triumphant, at least reasonably redemptive. A fourth-round victory over Elena Rybakina showed Swiatek's finest competitive qualities. There followed a sound win over the tenacious Elina Svitolina. But then, hoping to reach the finals in Paris for the fourth straight year, Swiatek came across a highly proficient Sabalenka.‚ÄúObviously looking at the math, I lost many points right now, but I know that it doesn't really matter,‚Äù said Swiatek following that match. We kind of start every tournament from the beginning. So I'm just going to try to do my job and focus on, like, just getting progress and learning new stuff on grass right now.‚ÄùA few weeks ago, I opined that, in her quest to rekindle her love of the game, Swiatek should go coach-free for a while. On a more micro basis, my idea is that Swiatek refine her serve. All this said, only traces of what Swiatek showed in Paris give me significant confidence in her possibilities for a deeper than usual Wimbledon run. ‚ÄúObviously looking at the math, I lost many points right now, but I know that it doesn't really matter,‚Äù said Swiatek following that match.

Global as tennis can be, at Grand Slam events that are attended by vast thousands who scarcely know much about tennis, national pride often carries the day. Let's also keep in mind the last time a Frenchwoman won the singles title came 25 years ago, when Mary Pierce raised the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen (unfortunately, a ceremony to honor Pierce was cancelled when she withdrew due to personal reasons). Not in sports, though, as proven this year by Boisson's enchanting journey to the semis. But week two was where she took even bigger strides, defeating top tenners Jessica Pegula and Mirra Andreeva. Or was it simply the culmination of a long road back to proficiency?‚ÄúNo, I don't think it's a miracle,‚Äù Boisson said following her quarterfinal win over Andreeva. Nothing else.‚ÄùBoisson's massive forehand and many adroit shots wowed the fans, disrupted her opponents, and rocketed her 296 spots up the ranks to 65. Boisson's significant pro tennis journey has only just begun. Not in sports, though, as proven this year by Boisson's enchanting journey to the semis.

All four quarterfinal losers in Paris were surely frustrated by their defeats‚Äîbut also figure to make their share of headlines at Wimbledon. Andreeva may have withered in the face of an inspired Boisson and a highly partisan crowd, but certainly that experience will help her continue to mature emotionally. Keys, surely happier than ever in the wake of having earned her first singles major, was toe-to-toe with Gauff until the third set of their quarterfinal.

The new rule means players can now take time away from professional tennis for a fertility protection procedure such as egg or embryo freezing and safely return to competition with a protected ranking. Eligible players will receive a Special Entry Ranking (SER), which can be used to enter up to three tournaments, based on the 12-week average of their WTA Ranking from eight weeks prior to the start of their out-of-competition period. By introducing this new form of ranking protection, the WTA helps to support and empower women athletes to balance a professional sports career with planning and starting a family at a time of their choice. The rule expands the WTA's comprehensive Family Focus Program, which includes ranking protection during pregnancy, or another means of parenthood, and postpartum support with a return to play. For any woman, the conversation of family life versus a career is nuanced and complex. It's truly ground-breaking and will empower this generation, and future generations of players, to continue with the sport they love without having to compromise.‚Äù After hearing from players that the option of fertility protection offers a proactive way to balance family goals and career ambitions, we're delighted that this new measure, alongside the fertility grant offered by the PIF WTA Maternity Fund, will contribute to enabling our athletes to realize their full potential and become parents at a time of their choice.‚Äù The new rule means players can now take time away from professional tennis for a fertility protection procedure such as egg or embryo freezing and safely return to competition with a protected ranking.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dive deep into the extraordinary career of tennis sensation Carlos Alcaraz. At just 22, this Spanish prodigy has already etched out a legendary path. We take a look at his roots in Murcia, how many times he's lifted the Wimbledon trophy and his impressive Grand Slam haul. Carlos Alcaraz is 22 years old, having been born on May 5, 2003. He grew up in El Palmar, a suburb of Murcia, Spain. His father, a former tennis player and academy director, introduced him to the sport at a very young age at the Real Sociedad Club de Campo de Murcia. Alcaraz has a great Wimbledon record, especially considering his relatively short career so far, having won two Wimbledon singles titles. A year later he defended his title, again beating Novak Djokovic in the final, this time in straight sets. This means he has a 90% winning percentage at Wimbledon, which is exceptionally high. Carlos Alcaraz has stated that he is currently single. He has openly discussed the difficulties of maintaining a relationship due to his demanding travel schedule as a professional tennis player. While he has been linked to other individuals in the past, such as Maria Gonz√°lez Gim√©nez and Emma Raducanu, he has not confirmed any relationships. He had a very successful first appearance in the Men's Singles event, reaching the final and securing a silver medal. His journey to the final included several remarkable victories before a hard-fought gold medal match against Novak Djokovic. In Men's Doubles, Alcaraz teamed up with compatriot Rafael Nadal, forming a highly anticipated partnership. They demonstrated strong chemistry on the court and had a respectable run, reaching the quarter-finals before their elimination. US Open: Won his first Grand Slam title here in 2022. A post shared by Carlos Alcaraz Garfia (@carlitosalcarazz) 2 has been fuelled by a series of victories at the sport's biggest events. That same year, winning ATP Masters 1000 titles in Miami and Madrid further cemented his rise. In 2023, he claimed his second major at Wimbledon, defeating Novak Djokovic. He also secured another ATP Masters 1000 title in Indian Wells and successfully defended his Madrid Open crown.

He is a global ambassador for major brands like Nike (with a reported 10-year deal worth $15-20 million annually), Rolex, BMW, Calvin Klein, and Louis Vuitton.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz's coach Juan Carlos Ferrero has spoken out after the five-time Grand Slam winner jetted off to Ibiza to celebrate his remarkable success at Roland Garros. The 22-year-old saved three championship points before going on to secure a 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2) win and retain his title. Following the triumph, it soon emerged that Alcaraz planned on celebrating in style. He is set to enjoy a three-day trip in Ibiza before turning his attention to the grass season, having enjoyed a similar short break last year after winning his first French Open title. Speaking about Alcaraz's plans, Ferrero revealed that he has spoken with the tennis superstar and reminded him about the upcoming schedule, telling El Laguero: ‚ÄúHe's switching off. Yesterday I told him to have a good time because he deserved it, but to remember that he is a tennis player. Don't miss...    Aryna Sabalenka torn apart as controversial Coco Gauff comments cause a storm ‚ÄúWe know how he is, these days suit him well, he'll come back refreshed and in a good mental state. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. He explained: ‚ÄúIn the third [set] also a break down after losing two sets, when you sit on the chair you start to think that maybe Jannik didn't lose a set and I'm two sets down, it's going to be very difficult to come back. ‚ÄúBut I think his strength is to keep believing all the time until the last ball is gone and he tries and tries. But with Carlos everything is possible and he did it again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This double blow comes as a major setback for Federer and his long-time agent Tony Godsick, who co-own the management firm they founded back in 2013. Shelton, who is gearing up for Wimbledon later this month, has made a surprising move by signing with talent agency WME (William Morris Endeavour), which also owns IMG (International Management Group). Joining the ranks of stellar tennis stars like Carlos Alcaraz, Serena Williams, and Iga Swiatek, Shelton is set to make waves in his new representation. Meanwhile, Coco Gauff, fresh off her recent French Open victory, has taken a different path by establishing her own venture, Coco Gauff Enterprises, with the backing of WME. Former French Open champion Michael Chang praised Federer, along with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, for revolutionizing the culture of tennis. According to Chang, these tennis icons transformed the locker room environment, fostering a sense of camaraderie and respect among players regardless of their ranking or status in the game.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aryna Sabalenka has been under fire for her remarks about Coco Gauff following her loss in the French Open final. 1 with a score of 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 6-4 to secure her first-ever title at Roland Garros. Sabalenka stirred controversy with her post-match comments, suggesting that if Iga Swiatek ‚Äì whom she defeated in the semi-finals ‚Äì had reached what would have been her fourth straight final in Paris, she would have beaten Gauff. Despite issuing an apology on social media, Sabalenka still faced criticism for her conduct. Rennae Stubbs, the former coach of Serena Williams, was among the prominent voices disapproving of Sabalenka's actions, calling her press statements "so bad" and expressing disappointment even after the belated online apology. "Like, it took her 24 hours after that to write an apology, essentially, on Instagram. That was so bad, and there's no excuses for it. And that's coming from me who, as I said, I've said some stuff in press. Like, you never take it away from your opponent." After lifting the trophy, Gauff confidently responded to Sabalenka's earlier suggestion that Swiatek would have been a tougher final opponent, chuckling: "I mean, I don't agree with that. She reminded everyone of her recent triumph over Swiatek at the Madrid Open, stating: "Last time I played ‚Äì no shade to Iga or anything, but I played her and I won in straight sets. Yeah, I don't think that's a fair thing to say, because anything can really happen. So I think she was the best person that I could have played in the final. Later, Gauff addressed Sabalenka's post-final remarks with grace, reports the Express. "I mean after that I was a little bit surprised about the comments and everything, but I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt," she said. "I'm sure it was just an emotional day, an emotional match, and every time I play Aryna, she's a fighter. I think we're like 6-5 in the head-to-head, so it's very close." However, not everyone was as sportsmanlike towards Sabalenka, with The Real Housewives of New York reality TV star Ubah Hassan delivering a scathing critique. She left a biting comment on a video of Sabalenka's remarks: "No mistake was made, darling your lip filler just got in the way of your vision.??????"

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexander Zverev has fired back at German tennis pundits Boris Becker and Barbara Rittner after criticism following his French Open exit. The 28-year-old's career was put under the microscope on German TV following his defeat, with tennis icon Becker, a six-time Grand Slam winner, and Billie Jean King Cup captain Rittner among those sharing their thoughts. Both former pros suggested that he needed to move away from his father, Alexander Sr, and brother Mischa. It's the same in football, as a football coach you don't normally stay with a club for 10 years,‚Äù commented Becker. He decides what Team Zverev will look like in the future. His father and brother did an excellent job, but it wasn't good enough for the final step.‚Äù Following a short break, the world No 3 returns to action at the Stuttgart Open this week, looking to ramp up his grass-court preparations ahead of Wimbledon. Location of Carlos Alcaraz's French Open party is revealed as coach gives his reaction Statistics confirm Jannik Sinner's backhand is better than all of his tennis rivals ‚ÄúWhen things are going well for me, I always do everything right,‚Äù said Zverev. ‚ÄúI don't know why she [Rittner] suddenly has so much to say about my tennis career. To be honest, I don't take her opinion seriously. ‚ÄúAnd to be honest, I talked to Boris a lot, had a lot of contact with him before he made those statements. I don't know why it all has to be like this now.‚Äù Zverev was speaking ahead of his opening match in Stuttgart, with the German set to face mercurial Frenchman Corentin Moutet on Thursday. ‚ÄúIn every relationship, whether it's with a partner or someone else, there are issues to argue about. This is perhaps one of ours at the moment. ‚ÄúBut I don't always have to agree with him.‚Äù Read Next: The ranking points Alcaraz, Sinner, Djokovic, Zverev & ATP top-10 stars will defend on grass What prize money and ranking points did the biggest names earn at Roland Garros?
