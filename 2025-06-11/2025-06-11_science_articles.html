Developing bioelectronics capable of stably tracking brain-wide, single-cell, millisecond-resolved neural activity in the developing brain is critical for advancing neuroscience and understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. During development, the three-dimensional structure of the vertebrate brain arises from a two-dimensional neural plate1,2. These large morphological changes have previously posed a challenge for implantable bioelectronics to reliably track neural activity throughout brain development3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Here we introduce a tissue-level-soft, submicrometre-thick mesh microelectrode array that integrates into the embryonic neural plate by leveraging the tissue's natural two-dimensional-to-three-dimensional reconfiguration. As organogenesis progresses, the mesh deforms, stretches and distributes throughout the brain, seamlessly integrating with neural tissue. Immunostaining, gene expression analysis and behavioural testing confirm no adverse effects on brain development or function. This embedded electrode array enables long-term, stable mapping of how single-neuron activity and population dynamics emerge and evolve during brain development. In axolotl models, it not only records neural electrical activity during regeneration but also modulates the process through electrical stimulation.

In each test, a tadpole is placed in a clear tank, sitting on an upward-facing screen. The screen is programmed to display the appropriate stimulation pattern for the color preference, visual avoidance, and edge preference tests. In the color preference test, the screen alternated between displaying half white and half black for 40 s each. In the visual avoidance test, a black dot is directly controllable via a computer mouse. If the tadpole responded, the operator would proceed to initiate the next encounter. If the tadpole did not respond, the operator would initiate a new encounter after five seconds. In the edge preference test, the entire screen is white. The setup is placed inside a dark box to minimize light contamination. The interior of the box is coated black to minimize reflections from the screen. Tadpoles are recorded using a video camera pointed down on the tank through a hole in the top of the box. b-i, Time-lapse snapshots of a visual avoidance video showing the trajectory process of a behaving tadpole.

Nature volume 642, pages 343–350 (2025)Cite this article Conservation of damaged oil paintings requires manual inpainting of losses1,2, leading to months-long treatments of considerable expense; 70% of paintings in institutional collections are locked away from public view, in part because of treatment cost3,4. Recent advancements in digital image reconstruction have helped to envision treatment results, although without any direct means of achieving them5,6,7,8. Here I describe the physically applied digital restoration of a painting, a highly damaged oil-on-panel attributed to the Master of the Prado Adoration from the late fifteenth century. In parallel, 5,612 losses spanning 66,205 mm2 and 57,314 colours were infilled with a reversible laminate mask comprising a colour-accurate bilayer of printed pigments on polymeric films. To ensure the effectiveness of the restoration, ethical principles in painting conservation were implemented quantitatively for digital mask construction, a critically important foundation lacking in the current digital restoration literature. The infill process took 3.5 h, an estimated 66 times faster than conventional inpainting, and the result closely matched the simulation. This approach grants greatly increased foresight and flexibility to conservators, enabling the restoration of countless damaged paintings deemed unworthy of high conservation budgets.

Further processing accounts for tolerance analysis. c, Manual adjustments and final corrections are made to the base mask, which is split for fabrication. a, General artifacts are initially identified through thresholding perceived differences in value and saturation. b, Following application of tolerance analysis-driven considerations, larger areas end up consolidated with the majority of microscopic regions excluded. c, Contextual features, which are more easily visually perceived owing to their contrast with a uniform background, are separately masked. d, The combined general artifacts and contextual features mask spans most areas that require infilling based on human visual perception. e, Manual additions incorporate large area losses, such as the exposed panel support around the edges of the work, that are not visually significant from an algorithmic standpoint but are identifiable by a human viewer based on broader context. f, The final masking areas overlayed on the damaged painting. a, Scatter plot of all 57,314 colors used in the infill mask on HSV axes, with log color scale denoting the number of pixels each color is used for. b, Histogram of infill mask colors based on the number of pixels each color is used for.

To meet metabolic demands, many cancers take up extracellular lipids2,3,4,5; however, how these lipids contribute to cancer growth and progression remains poorly understood. Here, using functional genetic screens, we identify uptake of lipoproteins—the primary mechanism for lipid transport in circulation—as a key determinant of ferroptosis sensitivity in cancer. Lipoprotein supplementation robustly inhibits ferroptosis across diverse cancer types, primarily through the delivery of α-tocopherol (α-toc), the most abundant form of vitamin E in human lipoproteins. Mechanistically, cancer cells take up lipoproteins through a pathway dependent on sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) linked to cell-surface proteoglycans. Disrupting GAG biosynthesis or acutely degrading surface GAGs reduces lipoprotein uptake, sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis and impairs tumour growth in mice. Notably, human clear cell renal cell carcinomas—a lipid-rich malignancy—exhibit elevated levels of chondroitin sulfate and increased lipoprotein-derived α-toc compared with normal kidney tissue. Together, our study establishes lipoprotein uptake as a critical anti-ferroptotic mechanism in cancer and implicates GAG biosynthesis as a therapeutic target.

(2025)Cite this article Metrics details Eutyrannosaurians were large predatory dinosaurs that dominated Asian and North American terrestrial faunas in latest Cretaceous times. These apex predators arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids during the ‘middle' Cretaceous that are poorly known owing to the paucity of fossil material1,2,3. Here we report on a new tyrannosauroid, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis gen. et sp. nov., from lower Upper Cretaceous deposits of Mongolia that provides a new perspective on eutyrannosaurian origins and evolution. Phylogenetic analyses recover Khankhuuluu immediately outside Eutyrannosauria and recover the massive, deep-snouted Tyrannosaurini and the smaller, gracile, shallow-snouted Alioramini as highly derived eutyrannosaurian sister clades. Khankhuuluu and the late-diverging Alioramini independently share features related to a shallow skull and gracile build with juvenile eutyrannosaurians, reinforcing the key role heterochrony had in eutyrannosaurian evolution. Although eutyrannosaurians were mainly influenced by peramorphosis or accelerated growth4,5,6,7,8,9,10, Alioramini is revealed as a derived lineage that retained immature features through paedomorphosis and is not a more basal lineage as widely accepted11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. Our results reveal that Asian tyrannosauroids (similar to Khankhuuluu) dispersed to North America, giving rise to Eutyrannosauria in the mid-Late Cretaceous. Eutyrannosauria diversified and remained exclusively in North America until a single dispersal to Asia in the latest Cretaceous that established Alioramini and Tyrannosaurini. Stark morphological differences between Alioramini and Tyrannosaurini probably evolved due to divergent heterochronic trends—paedomorphosis versus peramorphosis, respectively—allowing them to coexist in Asia and occupy different ecological niches.

Cladogram with examples of Tyrannosaurinae skulls, including: a, Bistahieversor, b, Daspletosaurus, c, Alioramus (Alioramini), and d, Tyrannosaurus (Tyrannosaurini). Alioramini is supported as both a highly derived member of Tyrannosaurinae and as a sister taxon to the Tyrannosaurini by numerous unambiguous and exclusive synapomorphies. See Supplementary Information 8 for a full list of synapomorphies. Taxa excluded from the comprehensive analysis depicted in Fig. 3 are Kileskus, Juratyrant, Sinotyrannus, Stokesososaurus, Timurlengia, Alectrosaurus, Dryptosaurus, Nanuqsaurus, Thanatotheristes, and Zhuchengtyrannus. Values adjacent to nodes denote node support values: Bremer supports (left values < 20), bootstrap indices (right values > 50). Bremer support values and bootstrap indices increase significantly for most clades relative to those clades in the comprehensive analysis in Fig. Among derived tyrannosaurine taxa (e.g., Alioramini+Tyrannosaurini), higher node values are found here relative to similar positions in the comprehensive tree in Fig. This reveals that lower overall support values in the comprehensive tree is primarily due to ambiguity incurred in character state transformations with the inclusion of highly fragmentary taxa, particularly in late-diverging tyrannosauroids (e.g., Nanuqsaurus [8.1% of characters scored], Thanatotheristes [19.0%] Zhuchengtyrannus [10.3%]). Supporting information for main text includes measurements and ontogenetic assessment for Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, supplementary discussions for the phylogenetic position of Alioramini, phylogenetic protocols including taxon and character omissions, character list, clade synapomorphies, Templeton's test results, and additional tests of time calibration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A sugar compound found in sea cucumbers can effectively block Sulf-2, an enzyme that plays a major role in cancer growth, according to a University of Mississippi-led study published in Glycobiology. "Marine life produces compounds with unique structures that are often rare or not found in terrestrial vertebrates," said Marwa Farrag, a fourth-year doctoral candidate in the UM Department of BioMolecular Sciences. "And so, the sugar compounds in sea cucumbers are unique. They aren't commonly seen in other organisms. Farrag, a native of Assiut, Egypt, and the study's lead author, worked with a team of researchers from Ole Miss and Georgetown University on the project. Human cells, and those of most mammals, are covered in tiny, hairlike structures called glycans that help with cell communication, immune responses and the recognition of threats such as pathogens. "The cells in our body are essentially covered in 'forests' of glycans," said Vitor Pomin, associate professor of pharmacognosy. "We were able to compare what we generated experimentally with what the simulation predicted, and they were consistent," said Robert Doerksen, professor of medicinal chemistry. "That gives us more confidence in the results." Unlike other Sulf-2 regulating medications, the sea cucumber compound does not interfere with blood clotting, said Joshua Sharp, UM associate professor of pharmacology. "As you can imagine, if you are treating a patient with a molecule that inhibits blood coagulation, then one of the adverse effects that can be pretty devastating is uncontrolled bleeding," he said. "Some of these drugs we have been using for 100 years, but we're still isolating them from pigs because chemically synthesizing it would be very, very difficult and very expensive," Sharp said. Unlike extracting carbohydrate-based drugs from pigs or other land mammals, extracting the compound from sea cucumbers does not carry a risk of transferring viruses and other harmful agents, Pomin said. "It's a more beneficial and cleaner resource," he said. "The marine environment has many advantages compared to more traditional sources." But sea cucumbers - some variants of which are a culinary delicacy in the Pacific Rim - aren't so readily abundant that scientists could go out and harvest enough to create a line of medication. "One of the problems in developing this as a drug would be the low yield, because you can't get tons and tons of sea cucumbers," Pomin said. The interdisciplinary nature of the scientific study, which featured researchers from chemistry, pharmacognosy and computational biology, underscored the importance of cross-disciplinary collaboration in tackling complex diseases like cancer, Pomin said. "This research took multiple expertise - mass spectrometry, biochemistry, enzyme inhibition, computation," Pomin said.

Nature volume 642, pages 327–335 (2025)Cite this article Silicon has enabled advancements in semiconductor technology through miniaturization, but scaling challenges necessitate the exploration of new materials1. Two-dimensional (2D) materials, with their atomic thickness and high carrier mobility, offer a promising alternative2,3,4,5. Although significant progress has been made in wafer-scale growth6,7,8, high-performance field-effect transistors9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 and circuits based on 2D materials21,22,23, achieving complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) integration remains a challenge. Here, we present a 2D one instruction set computer based on CMOS technology, leveraging the heterogeneous integration of large-area n-type MoS2 and p-type WSe2 field-effect transistors. By scaling the channel length, incorporating a high-κ gate dielectric and optimizing material growth and device postprocessing, we tailored the threshold voltages for both n- and p-type 2D field-effect transistors, achieving high drive currents and reduced subthreshold leakage. This enabled circuit operation below 3 V with an operating frequency of up to 25 kHz, which was constrained by parasitic capacitances, along with ultra-low power consumption in the picowatt range and a switching energy as low as approximately 100 pJ. Finally, we projected the performance of the one instruction set computer and benchmarked it against state-of-the-art silicon technology using an industry-standard SPICE-compatible BSIM-BULK model. This model was calibrated with experimental data that incorporate device-to-device variations. Although further advances are needed, this work marks a significant milestone in the application of 2D materials to microelectronics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Solar power is growing by leaps and bounds in the United States, propelled by climate mitigation policies and carbon-free energy goals -- and California is leading the way as the nation's top producer of solar electricity. A new study in Energy Strategy Reviews has revealed a dark side to the state's breakneck pace for solar investment, deployment, and adoption, taking a first-time look at patterns of public and private sector corruption in the California solar market. Researchers at the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability (IGS) have identified seven distinct types of corruption abuses and risks in California solar energy. To fully realize a just energy transition, the authors call for major solar reforms in California as the U.S. increasingly relies on solar energy to decarbonize its electricity sector. "In this groundbreaking study, we find that efforts to accelerate solar infrastructure deployment in California end up contributing to a sobering array of corruption practices and risks. Drawing on a literature review and original interviews and fieldwork, the study's authors arrive at a framework that helps explore the wider socio-political realities driving corruption at a time of explosive growth in the California solar market, from 2010 to 2024. During this period, the state's solar energy production increased exponentially, reaching 79,544 gigawatt hours in 2024, or enough to power approximately 7.4 million U.S. households for a year, according to the State of Renewable Energy dashboard. "The most eye-opening finding for me is how common corruption is at every level of solar development, from small-scale vendors to high-level government officials, even in a well-regulated, progressive state like California," says co-author Alexander Dunlap, an IGS research fellow. They set out to document patterns of perceived corruption from a broad range of voices, gaining insights through organized focus groups and observation at different solar sites, as well as conducting interviews door-to-door and in a local supermarket parking lot. While the study's authors acknowledge the difficulty of confirming individual claims of corruption, their mixed-methods research approach combines these personal assertions with analysis of news stories, court testimony, and other official sources to support their findings. Outside of a few headline-making scandals, corruption in California's renewable energy sector has gone largely unexamined, allowing the underlying dynamics at play to erode the potential of a just energy transition. Examining Patterns of Public and Private Sector Corruption within the Booming California Solar Energy Market," is part of a larger IGS research project looking at injustices in U.S. solar and wind energy supply chains.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We Earthlings see the sun every day of our lives—but gaining a truly new view of our star is a rare and precious thing. So count your lucky stars: for the first time in history, scientists have photographed one of the sun's elusive poles. The images come courtesy of a spacecraft called Solar Orbiter. Led by the European Space Agency (ESA) with contributions from NASA, Solar Orbiter launched in February 2020 and has been monitoring our home star since November 2021. From Earth and spacecraft alike, our view of the sun has been biased. “We've had a good view of centermost part of the sun's disk,” says Daniel Müller, a heliophysicist and project scientist for the mission. “But the poles are effectively not visible because we always see them almost exactly edge-on.” If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. That tilted orbit is what allows Solar Orbiter to garner unprecedented views of the sun's poles. Several views of the sun as seen by Solar Orbiter in March 2025. For scientists, the new view is priceless because these poles aren't just geographic poles; they're also magnetic poles—of sorts. This is what drives the 11-year solar activity cycle. At solar minimum, the lowest-activity part of the cycle, the sun's magnetic field is what scientists call a dipole: it looks like a giant bar magnet, with a strong pole at each end. The result is a bizarre transitional state, with the sun's poles covered in a patchwork of localized “north” and “south” magnetic polarities. (It can be a bumpy process—sometimes one pole loses its charge before the other, for example.) Then, as years pass and solar activity gradually declines, the continuing process of sunspots developing and dissipating creates a new magnetic field of the opposite charge at each pole until, eventually, the sun reaches its calm dipole state again. These aren't matters of academic curiosity; the sun's activity affects our daily lives. Solar outbursts such as radiation flares and coronal mass ejections of charged plasma can travel across the inner solar system to reach our neighborhood, and they're channeled out of the sun by our star's ever changing magnetic fields. But to do that, they need to better understand how the sun works—which is difficult to do with hardly a glimpse of the magnetic activity at and around our star's poles. Most of the spacecraft's observations won't reach Earth until this autumn. But ESA has released initial looks from three different instruments onboard Solar Orbiter, each of which lets scientists glimpse different phenomena. Patches of blue and red mark the mixed magnetic fields in this region that characterize solar maximum. And from this view, Müller says, it's clear that the sun is at the maximum period of its activity cycle. Heliophysical models predict “a tangled mess of all these different patches of north and south polarity all over the place,” he says. As their accordance with theoretical models suggests, the solar poles aren't entirely mysterious realms. That's in part because while Solar Orbiter is the first to beam back polar images, it isn't the first spacecraft to fly over these regions. Ulysses carried a host of instruments designed to study radiation particles, magnetic fields, and more. But it carried no cameras, so despite all its insights, Ulysses left those regions as sights unseen. Fortunately, heliophysics has grown a lot since those days—and space agencies have learned that, in the public eye, a picture can be worth much more than 1,000 words.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Medium-chain chlorinated paraffins, or MCCPs, have been detected in the air of Asia and Antarctica, but this surprise Oklahoma discovery is a first for North America. Arguably the most well-known of these chemical culprits are per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are used for stuff like non-stick surfaces on frying pans. They are also known as “forever chemicals” for their tendency to linger in the environment. But this environmental scourge is only one of many similar substances. MCCPs have been detected in the atmosphere on other continents (including Asia and even Antarctica) but a new study from the University of Colorado Boulder claims that North America has now joined that unlucky list. In setting out to detect how aerosols form and grow in an agricultural region of Oklahoma, the team of scientists behind this recent study stumbled across trace amounts of MCCPs in the atmosphere. They detected these particles using a technique known as nitrate ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry, and the results were published last week in the journal ACS Environmental AU. MCCPs start their lives within things like metalworking fluids, textiles, and PVC, which is why they can often find themselves in wastewater. That's a problem, because a fertilizer known as biosolids (which is made from treated sewar sludge) is often spread across agricultural crops. Sewage sludge fertilizers have been shown to release similar compounds.” The creation of this synthetic chemical was in large part due to the regulation of its toxic cousin, Short Chain Chlorinated Paraffins (SCCPs), which have been regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Stockholm Convention (an international body formed in 2001 to protect human health against persistent organic pollutants). Earlier this year, the Stockholm Convention also marked MCCPs for global elimination. “We always have these unintended consequences of regulation, where you regulate something, and then there's still a need for the products that those were in,” Ellie Browne, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. Now that MCCPs have been found in the atmosphere, the UC Boulder team hopes that future efforts will be able to discern their airborne impact. “I think it's important that we continue to have governmental agencies that are capable of evaluating the science and regulating these chemicals as necessary for public health and safety.” A New Study Says You Can Delay Death—but Not Aging</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How can the strange properties of quantum particles be exploited to perform extremely accurate measurements? One example is the atomic clock, which uses the quantum properties of atoms to measure time much more accurately than would be possible with conventional clocks. Some randomness or a certain amount of statistical noise has to be accepted. This results in fundamental limits to the accuracy that can be achieved. Until now, it seemed to be an immutable law that a clock twice as accurate requires at least twice as much energy. "We have analyzed in principle, which clocks could be theoretically possible," says Prof. Marcus Huber from the Atomic Institute at the TU Wien. And second, a counter - any element that counts how many time units defined by the time base generator have already passed." After a certain number of oscillations, the caesium atom in an atomic clock returns to exactly the same state it was in before. "This means that every clock must be connected to an irreversible process," says Florian Meier from TU Wien. The pendulum of a pendulum clock generates a little heat and disorder among the air molecules around it, and every laser beam that reads the state of an atomic clock generates heat, radiation and thus entropy. "We can now consider how much entropy a hypothetical clock with extremely high precision would have to generate - and, accordingly, how much energy such a clock would need," says Marcus Huber. However, the research team at TU Wien, together with the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW) in Vienna and the teams from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, and University of Malta, has now shown that this apparent rule can be circumvented by using two different time scales. You can connect a whole series of such time-measuring devices in series and count how many of them have already passed through - similar to how one clock hand counts how many laps the other clock hand has already completed. "This way, you can increase accuracy, but not without investing more energy," says Marcus Huber. "Because every time one clock hand completes a full rotation and the other clock hand is measured at a new location - you could also say every time the environment around it notices that this hand has moved to a new location - the entropy increases. In a sense, the particle is then everywhere at once during this process; it has no clearly defined location until it finally arrives - and only then is it actually measured, in an irreversible process that increases entropy. "So we have a fast process that does not cause entropy - quantum transport - and a slow one, namely the arrival of the particle at the very end," explains Yuri Minoguchi, TU Wien. "The crucial thing about our method is that one hand behaves purely in terms of quantum physics, and only the other, slower hand actually has an entropy-generating effect." The team has now been able to show that this strategy enables an exponential increase in accuracy per increase in entropy. This means that much higher precision can be achieved than would have been thought possible according to previous theories. "This is an important result for research into high-precision quantum measurements and suppression of unwanted fluctuations," says Marcus Huber, "and at the same time it helps us to better understand one of the great unsolved mysteries of physics: the connection between quantum physics and thermodynamics."

Some creatures deteriorate so slowly that we've never actually caught them dying of old age. Others don't seem to age at all. And some can apparently reset their biological clocks and bounce back to infancy to start all over again. Plenty of humans would like to figure out how that works—and potentially harness the ability for our own use. But science has a long way to go.

Thank you so much for coming on to chat today. Feltman: So I'm sure that all of our listeners know that different species have different lifespans, but could you start by giving us a sense of some of the extremes that are out there? It's been a mystery of biology for a very long time, ever since Aristotle noticed [these] differences in lifespan across species. And this happens even amongst closely related species like mammals. For example, hamsters live about two years; mice and rats can live up to three or four years; and, you know, of course, humans, we can live over 100 years. And then at the other end of the spectrum we have certain species of whales that have been estimated to live over 200 years ... Feltman: Yeah, and then, besides mammals, I would assume that things get even more extreme when you're talking about less closely related species. So it's not that they're immortal [in] that you can't kill them, but they are biologically immortal in the sense that biological time, for them, doesn't roll in one direction, like it happens for us. Magalhães: So there's very unusual animals—again, we're talking invertebrates like rotifers or very simple animals—whose adults don't have mouths. Magalhães: They don't have a way of feeding. So you have a very big variety in terms of not just longevity and paces of aging but even in aging phenotypes and how species degenerate and die. Magalhães: So aging, we are all familiar with it—I tend to have a very broad definition of aging as a, a progressive and inevitable physiological degeneration, an increase in vulnerability and decrease in viability. Now, of course, there's many facets to aging. But there's also, of course, many cellular, molecular changes that occur as well. So one of the hallmarks of aging is that once you reach about age 30 your chance of dying [doubles] roughly every eight years, and that's very consistent across populations. And that happens as well in animals, only in animals like mice, it varies a bit between strains, but it'll be something like every few months the chance of dying doubles. You know, why is it inevitable for most species, but then, you know, for some, like those jellyfish, it doesn't seem to be? We don't have a good understanding why some species age very fast. So for example, mice and rats, as I mentioned, they only live up to three or four years, but they also age much faster than human beings. No matter how you take care of them, a mouse will age about 20, 25, 30 times faster than a human being. So we know there's a very big diversity, also, in rates of aging, but what's behind it is not well-understood. We know there must be genetic differences, again, because no matter how well you take care of your mouse or hamster or rat, it will age a lot faster than a human being. But then, of course, the question is, “Okay, but what [are] the biochemical, molecular, cellular determinants?” That's something we don't understand well yet. For example, one idea that's been around for decades is the idea that damage to the DNA and mutations in the DNA accumulate gradually with age and then cause aging. And the hypothesis being that in mice, for example, [this] accumulation of mutations occurs much faster—for which there is some experimental evidence. And at the moment, however, it's still unproven or unknown, really, why human beings age. Feltman: Hmm, and are there any factors that long-living organisms have in common? Magalhães: There are multiple factors associated with long lifespans. I mean, the important point is that we are a product of our evolutionary history. So if you have animals like—short-lived animals like mice, I mean, mice in the wild very rarely live more than one year, not just because of diseases but primarily because of predators ... I mean, we are protected from predators, one, because we're relatively big for primates and, of course, because of our intelligence, which [allowed] us to escape predators when we were, of course, in the time of cavemen and when we were evolving. So across species there's this pattern, of course, of, you know, we are a product of our evolution, and we have the life history and the longevity that fits our evolutionary history. Feltman: What kinds of tools are researchers using to try to answer all of these questions we have about aging and lifespan? Magalhães: So there's different types of tools we can use. I mean, one big technological breakthrough was DNA sequencing. I mean, the human genome sequencing cost billions of dollars, but nowadays you can sequence your own genome, anyone can sequence their genomes for [a] few hundred dollars. So it's relatively cheap to sequence genomes, which means we can also sequence the genomes of different species, species with different lifespans. So for example, our lab, we sequenced the genome of the bowhead whale, which is the longest-lived mammal, [which has] been estimated to live over 200 years, as well as naked mole rats and other long-lived, disease-resistant species. And so what you can do with that trove of information is analyze it for patterns associated with the evolution of longevity. You can ask questions—so for example, you know, “Do species that live a longer lifespan, do they have more DNA repair genes?” So you can use that information on the DNA to study the evolution of longevity, then try to find specific genes and pathways associated with it. Magalhães: Now, the other approach we use to study aging, of course, is in model systems. I mean, unfortunately we cannot really study aging in human beings—or we can, but it's very difficult and time-consuming—and so we tend to use short-lived model systems like mice or fruit flies or worms. We tend to use fruit flies, Drosophila, that live a few months. Mice can live up to three, four years. I mean, there's some rationale for it because we know the basic biochemistry of life in a mouse is quite similar to humans. We can also manipulate aging to some degree in animal models, particularly at the genetic level. But for example, in worms we can tweak a single gene in worms and extend by about 10 times ... So we can do a lot of studies in animal models: we can manipulate aging to some degree in animals, and then we can do mechanistic studies. We can look at their molecules, we can look at their cells, we can look at their hormones and try to test mechanistic [hypotheses] of aging. Feltman: What do you think are the biggest questions that we should be tackling about human aging and human lifespans? Magalhães: Well, I suppose the big question is still why we age. There's different hypothesis, but we still don't know why we age, and I think that remains the big question in the field. There's other questions, of course: Can we manipulate human aging? Because although we can manipulate, to some degree, aging in animal models, we don't know if that's possible or not in human beings. We can manipulate, to some degree, our longevity by exercise, eating healthy, not smoking, not drinking too much alcohol, and so on. But whether, for example, can we develop a longevity drug? And there's a number of companies and labs trying to develop longevity pills, and—but whether they're gonna be effective in humans, that's still something that's up to discussion and will require, for example, clinical trials. Magalhães: So one aspect that's quite fundamental and important in, in aging is that there are complex species—like some species of reptiles like the Galápagos tortoise; some species of fishes, like rockfishes; some species in salamanders, like the olm—that appear not to age at all. There's no mammals in this category, but there are complex vertebrates that, in studies spanning decades, do not exhibit increased mortality, do not exhibit increased physiological degeneration. So that is quite a fascinating observation, that some species—I mean, maybe they do age after a very long time, but at the very least they age much, much, much slower than human beings ... Magalhães: Which I think is a great inspiration as well. Because, so, for example, just like the Wright brothers took inspiration from birds: they saw birds—“Well, birds are heavier than air, and yet they can fly, so there's no reason to think we cannot build a machine that's heavier than air and can make us fly.” We can take inspiration [from] these animals.
