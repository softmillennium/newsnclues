Polling shows that three-quarters of Americans oppose Trump's decision to hold a military parade this weekend.

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump warned that anyone planning to engage in protests against his military parade this weekend would be met with “big force” — a statement that is antithetical to the free speech and assembly rights established by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

The military parade, ostensibly meant to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army's founding, coincides with Trump's 79th birthday, leading several critics to suggest that the parade is more about himself (and his authoritarian ambitions) than it is about the military.

The threat from Trump also comes after he has sent thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines to Los Angeles, California, to aid raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials and to crush anti-ICE uprisings in L.A. Trump has also threatened a militaristic response to protests in other cities across the country.

In comments on the parade to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said that Saturday, June 14, will be an “amazing day” that will include Army tanks, planes and “all sorts of things.” He also indicated that his administration was prepared to suppress any demonstrations against the parade.

“If there's any protest that wants to come out, they will be met with very big force,” Trump warned.

Trump repeated his warning later on in the presser.

“Those people who want to protest…[will be] met with very big force,” he said.

Trump also insinuated that those taking part in such protests were un-American, claiming that those protesting his parade would include “people who hate our country.”

However, recent polling data demonstrates that Trump's views run counter to those of most Americans.

A PRRI poll published on Tuesday, for example, found that more than three-quarters of Americans (76 percent) oppose having a military parade at all, with nearly one in two respondents saying they “strongly oppose” the idea. Only 21 percent of Americans want the parade to happen, the survey showed.

A flash poll conducted by YouGov earlier this week also found that more Americans opposed Trump's militaristic response to the L.A. protests than supported them. Only 34 percent of Americans backed deploying Marines to L.A., that polling found, while 47 percent were opposed. Similarly, only 38 percent of Americans supported sending National Guard troops to quell the L.A. protests, while 45 percent were opposed.

Trump's approval rating, which has been in negative territory for months, has also sunk slightly following his announced deployment of U.S. troops to L.A., according to an aggregate of surveys from RealClearPolling. Indeed, an Economist/YouGov poll published on Tuesday found that Trump's approval rating stood at only 43 percent, with 52 percent of Americans disapproving of his job performance so far in his second term.

Hundreds of demonstrations against Trump, dubbed “No Kings protests,” are set to take place across the U.S. on Saturday, including several near Washington, D.C. 

“No Kings is a nationwide day of defiance,” a description of the event on its website reads. “From city blocks to small towns, from courthouse steps to community parks, we're taking action to reject authoritarianism — and show the world what democracy really looks like.”

Immigrant rights advocates who have been organizing as the ban takes effect discuss the latest developments.

Condemnation is growing of President Trump's travel ban that went into effect Monday, banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States: Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and the Republic of Congo. It also imposes heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. President Trump is “destroying what this nation stands for,” says Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition. “Immigration in the U.S. is an American value.” Guerline Jozef, co-founder and executive director of Haitian Bridge Alliance, called on communities to “fight to make sure that people have the right to migrate.” The administration is “literally separating families,” says Jozef.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Nermeen Shaikh in New York.

AMY GOODMAN: And I'm Amy Goodman in Salt Lake City, Utah.

We're looking now at the growing condemnation of President Trump's travel ban, which went into effect Monday, banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States: Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and the Republic of Congo — not to be confused with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It also imposes heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the U.S. and don't hold a valid visa.

Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown said he may challenge the ban with what he called a “hostile” Supreme Court. Brown spoke Sunday with Washington state Representative Darya Farivar, the state's first elected Middle Eastern politician, first Iranian American woman elected to the Washington state Legislature.

REP. DARYA FARIVAR: This ban will hurt people, real people. It will tear families apart at life's most sacred moments, keep loved ones from mourning, celebrating and holding each other close in their final moments. It will steal opportunities from brilliant students who deserve a future. It promises four more years of separation, four more years of sorrow, and we cannot allow this.

ATTORNEY GENERAL NICHOLAS BROWN: The president's order is unclearly — is clearly unfair, discriminatory and will impact millions and millions of people who pose no risk whatsoever to our country. And when we couple this travel ban with everything else that we are seeing in this country at this moment, including the president's violent escalation of events in California this week, we know what we are seeing from the president of the United States of America is creeping authoritarianism.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: This follows Trump's first travel ban in 2017.

Immigrant rights groups have been organizing as the ban takes effect this week, including two organizers who join us now. In New York, Guerline Jozef is co-founder and executive director of Haitian Bridge Alliance. And Murad Awawdeh is president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, usually based in New York City and today in Montgomery, Alabama.

Welcome to both of you to Democracy Now! Guerline, let's begin with you. Haiti is one of the countries included in this travel ban. So, if you could talk about the impact of that on Haiti, which is dependent not only so much on aid, international aid, but also on remittances from Haitians working in the U.S.?

GUERLINE JOZEF: Thank you so much for having me.

And the reality is what we are seeing right now with the travel ban targeting countries like Haiti. And for those who don't know, Haiti is literally 90 minutes away from Miami. And instead of addressing the root causes of the issues in Haiti, that are in part caused by U.S. foreign policy towards Haiti, and also looking into how the guns and the money and the ammunition is being funneled through Haiti to continue to destabilize the country, we are punishing Haiti for what is going on right now.

And the attack on Haiti and the multiple other countries, majority-Black and Muslim country — countries, are a clear example of why we're continuing. We must fight to make sure that people have the right to migrate. In the current ban literally separating families, I spoke to three people as we got the announcement, and two of them were supposed to go visit family in Canada, and they are stuck. They are afraid to leave, not being able to come back to continue their lives and their studies in the United States because they are Haitian passport holders. What will that mean when they try to leave or reenter the country will have a big impact on how the community continues to move forward.

AMY GOODMAN: So, do you know, Guerline, why Haiti was put on this list? And also, our news from the top of the show, the number of internally displaced people has reached a record 1.3 million in Haiti, the International Organization for Migration saying the figures jumped almost 25% since December due to the escalating violence. The kind of impact this total ban will have?

GUERLINE JOZEF: Thank you, Amy.

They are saying that people from Haiti tend to overstay their visas. And I want to clarify a couple of things. For the past almost three years, the consular section of the U.S. Embassy in Haiti has been closed. There is no way for someone in Haiti to be able to access to get a visa. They have to go to a third country to even be able to apply and get a visa if you are a Haitian national.

As you mentioned, 1.3 million people who are completely displaced within the country, and at the same time, we are hearing that there might be a deportation flight to Haiti within the next few days. We are looking into how that will continue in the destabilization of the country, but at the same time, how that impacts people here in the U.S. and around the world, with the trauma and the terror that we continue to see impacting people unable to go to work. I went to church on Sunday. About one-third of the people were afraid to come to church. We are seeing empty churches, empty workplaces. We are seeing the impact of this Trump travel ban and other immigration policies completely destroying communities that are vulnerable. And we must be able to push back.

So, it is imperative that people understand what's happening. And we continue to say that they are using immigration as a scapegoat to be able to dismantle every fabric of who we are as a country, from DEI to women's issues to LGBTQ — happy Pride Days to those who are celebrating — and the erasure of African American history. So, they are using immigration and immigrant communities as a scapegoat to continue to divide and conquer. And we are seeing that they have had a lot of practice. But we are here pushing back, fighting on behalf of those communities and making sure that they are protected, from California in San Diego —

AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to bring Murad — 

GUERLINE JOZEF: — to Los Angeles.

AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to bring Murad Awawdeh into the conversation, with the New York Immigration Coalition, though today he happens to be in Montgomery. And, Murad, I think that's interesting you're in Montgomery, because you have President Trump calling out the National Guard, federalizing it, in Los Angeles. The last time this happened — I mean, it hasn't happened in 60 years — was in the civil rights era, was to guarantee that the Selma to Montgomery March of civil rights workers, led by Dr. Martin Luther King and John Lewis, would be able to march. That was against the governor at the time. And President Trump now, 60 years later, not because of civil rights issues, but actually against civil rights issues, is making this move. But I wanted to ask you about this ban. In 2017, we were talking about a Muslim ban. This ban of all — absolute ban on this series of countries and partial ban on others, the impact this has?

MURAD AWAWDEH: The impact that this has on U.S. citizens is going to be immense. This means that people who have family abroad, who are in the process of actually trying to do the paperwork to get their family to come visit them, you know, to share the life celebrations that we all love or when we need to say our farewells to family members who pass, will not be possible anymore. This is going to rip families apart. This is going to continue to double and triple down on the terror that this administration is waging against immigrant communities across the board.

And what we need to do is, as my sister Guerline mentioned earlier, is actually stand up and continue to fight back against this. The Trump administration is trying to see how far they can take all that they're doing to ensure that they can really use immigrant communities as a test case. And I often say this: If some of us don't have rights in this country, none of us do. This is a really — this is a call to all Americans to start standing up and fighting back. This is going to be the test case. So, there's always a route that the administration continues to try to find. There was reports yesterday on MSNBC that what they're doing in L.A., which is horrifying to immigrant communities, but also to Americans, is going to be spread across the country and targeting U.S. cities, like New York City and other blue cities across the country.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Murad, I just want to — because Guerline mentioned that one of the reasons, justifications given by the Trump administration for imposing the travel ban on certain countries was people who overstayed their visas. Now, Chad is an example of a country that's been banned where almost 50% of people overstay. Spain, for instance, only 2.4% overstay. But the absolute numbers, there is an exponential difference. So, in the case 2023 to 2024, the 50% [overstay rate] from Chad amounted to 377 people, as against 20,000 people from Spain. So, if you could comment on what you think — and we have a minute left — on what the real justification for this ban, the countries that were selected, and then the New York for All Act that you're advocating?

MURAD AWAWDEH: So, the Trump administration doesn't need any help in trying to come up with frivolous excuses. That's all this is. They are looking for excuses to say that this is why they're doing this. And they don't need to try to sugarcoat things anymore, because we already know who they are. And we've known who they are. They are a administration that is gung ho on destroying what this nation stands for. Immigration and the U.S. is an American value. Like, I don't know how much more to explain this. But their excuses continue to fly in the face of facts.

And what we're doing right now across the state of New York is fighting for the New York for All Act, which would prohibit state collusion with immigration enforcement. We have a few days left in the state Legislature, and we're urging the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly, as well as Governor Hochul, to really stand up and protect our communities. We need to ensure that we are doing everything that we can to protect New Yorkers. The New York for All Act is a public safety measure. We want to keep all New Yorkers safe, and we can't do that if we don't have the laws in place to do it. So we're calling on our state Legislature to have the courage to stand up and to fight back with us by passing the New York for All Act today.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: Murad Awawdeh, New York Immigration Coalition, thanks so much for joining us, and Guerline Jozef, here in New York, of the Haitian Bridge Alliance.

Coming up, Israel is continuing to detain eight people after Israeli Navy commandos intercepted a Gaza-bound boat carrying humanitarian aid. Four others on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla have already been deported. We'll get an update from a Spanish crew member who's been deported back to Spain.

Greg Abbott says troops ‘on standby' in response to local police request ahead of planned protests this week

LA protests – live updates

The governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, has ordered the state's national guard to deploy to the city of San Antonio ahead of immigration-related protests planned for this week, saying the soldiers are “on standby”.

Abbott posted on social media early on Wednesday that the national guard “will be deployed to locations across the state to ensure peace & order. Peaceful protest is legal. Harming a person or property is illegal & will lead to arrest.”

The Texas national guard, he added, “will use every tool & strategy to help law enforcement maintain order”.

Abbott's move to mobilize troops follows Donald Trump's decision on Saturday to send the California national guard into Los Angeles after some limited and mostly peaceful protests against immigration raids. California leaders described the sending of the troops, and then 700 US marines, as a deliberate provocation.

Widespread demonstrations against the Trump administration's deportation raids are expected on Wednesday, according to local media reports, and on Saturday nationwide protests are planned as part of a “No Kings” event, according to organizers. Trump has planned a military parade in Washington for the same day and has threatened to treat any protesters harshly, despite the right to protest being enshrined in the US constitution.

Unlike in California, where neither the state governor not local civic leaders asked for military help – and where the state has sued to have them removed – in Texas the guard was reportedly sent after San Antonio law enforcement requested their assistance. According to the San Antonio Express News, the city police chief, William McManus, contacted state officials on Monday night seeking to confirm the presence of guardsmen in the city.

Abbott's press secretary, Andrew Mahaleris, later said that national guard soldiers “are on standby in areas where mass demonstrations are planned in case they are needed”.

“Peaceful protests are part of the fabric of our nation, but Texas will not tolerate the lawlessness we have seen in Los Angeles,” Mahaleris said in a statement on Tuesday night. “Anyone engaging in acts of violence or damaging property will be swiftly held accountable to the full extent of the law.”

A press conference is planned for Wednesday to discuss preparations for the protests in the city. On Sunday about 300 protesters had gathered in downtown San Antonio, some carrying flags and signs reading: “Abolish ICE,” “Power to the People,” and “Mexicans Ain't Going Anywhere.”

On Monday six demonstrators in Austin were arrested by officers with the Texas department of public safety after what the department called a “planned and well-publicized protest” near the state capitol. They have been charged with felony criminal mischief, resisting arrest and other offenses.

“Texas is a law-and-order state, and the department has zero tolerance for individuals disrupting public order or endangering law enforcement officers,” DPS said in a news release.

The “No Kings” protest planned for San Antonio on Saturday is being organized by the 50501 Movement, in coordination with the Bexar county Democratic party, the party for Socialism and Liberation, Indivisible and Women's March.

The protest, the organization said, will “culminate in an act of peaceful resistance”. The 50501 organization said on its website that it “stands in opposition to billionaire influence in government and advocates for the rights and empowerment of the working class”.

The Texas national guard is the largest of its kind in the US, with 22,000 soldiers and airmen. The governor serves as its commander, except when the president has mobilized the troops for federal duty.

All foreign assistance programs will be managed by the State Department.

A cable from the U.S. State Department Tuesday showed that the Trump administration is eliminating the entire international workforce of the foreign aid agency that has provided lifesaving assistance in the Global South for over six decades.

“The Department of State is streamlining procedures under National Security Decision Directive 38 to abolish all USAID overseas positions,” read the cable, referring to the U.S. Agency for International Development. The document was obtained by The Guardian.

USAID was one of the first targets of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), whose former leader, billionaire Elon Musk, has baselessly called the agency a “criminal organization.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in March that 5,200 of the agency's 6,200 international initiatives had been eliminated and that the few remaining programs were now under the control of the State Department.

The announcement by Rubio on Tuesday means all foreign assistance programs will be managed by the department, with the administration firing hundreds of foreign service officers, contractors, and local employees across more than 100 countries.

USAID officials and international humanitarian experts have warned since the Trump administration first moved to freeze foreign assistance in January that cuts to the agency would leave at least 1 million children without treatment for malnutrition, leave 200,000 more children paralyzed from vaccine-preventable polio over next decade, and cause up to 160,000 deaths from malaria.

But President Donald Trump has persistently claimed the agency is “run by a bunch of radical lunatics” and Rubio has said USAID operates “independent of the national interest.”

“Everything they do has to be aligned with U.S. foreign policy,” said Rubio earlier this year.

The announcement of the elimination of USAID's entire workforce came as government watchdog Public Citizen released a new report on Trump's stop-work order affecting the agency in January. The order “likely affected 32 USAID-funded clinical trials conducted across 25 countries and as many as 94 thousand participants.”

According to the report:

Due to the stop-work order, said Nina Zeldes, a health researcher at Public Citizen's Health Research Group, “researchers were unable to safeguard the welfare of participants and uphold their ethical obligations.”

Public Citizen said that “the sudden, medically uncalled-for suspension of the clinical trials was a serious violation of research ethics, potentially jeopardizing the health of trial participants and the integrity of the trials.”

The Center for Global Development also published an analysis Tuesday of estimates that have stated the White House's proposal of cutting global health and humanitarian aid funding by two-thirds would put 1 million lives at risk.

Researchers Charles Kenny and Justin Sandefur found that it was “implausible” that cuts to U.S. foreign assistance would only impact so-called “waste” and would preserve lifesaving assistance, as the administration has claimed.

“Using our estimates of costs per life saved for U.S. global health and humanitarian assistance based on available empirical evidence, we can calculate the potential number of lives at risk from such cuts,” wrote Kenny and Sandefur. “The calculation suggests the cuts could lead to 675,000 additional deaths from HIV, and a combined 285,000 deaths from malaria and tuberculosis.”

Beatle wrote in 1962 letter to Cynthia Powell that he wished he was on his way to her flat with ‘chocies and a throbber'

John Lennon is considered by many to be a poet. But the Beatle revealed his more prosaic side in a letter penned in 1962 to his future wife Cynthia Powell, in which he declared: “I wish I was on the way to your flat with the Sunday papers and chocies and a throbber.”

The intimate missive, which includes a complaint about his bandmate Paul McCartney's snoring, is now being sold at auction by Christie's with a £30,000 to £40,000 estimate.

Written over five nights after concerts during their Hamburg residency in April 1962, Lennon, then aged 21, wrote: “I love love love you and I'm missing you like mad … I wish I was on the way to your flat with the Sunday papers and chocies and a throbber.

“I wonder why all the newspapers wrote about Stu … I haven't seen Astrid since the day we arrived I've thought of going to see her but I would be so awkward.

“Paul's leaping about on my head (he's in a bunk on top of me and he's snoring) … Shurrup Mcarntey [sic]!”

He then tells Cynthia he does not like the idea of McCartney's then girlfriend, Dot Rhone, moving in with her, saying: “We would never be alone really … imagine having her there all the time when we were in bed – and imagine Paul coming all the time.”

He adds: “I love you please wait for me and don't be sad and work hard be a clever little Cyn Powell.”

Lennon and Cynthia, who was a year older than him, had been in a relationship for four years, having met at Liverpool College of Art.

They married in August 1962 and their son, Julian, was born in April 1963, weeks after Beatlemania exploded with the release of their chart-topping first album, Please Please Me.

The couple divorced in 1968 and she later claimed he had inflicted physical abuse on her throughout their relationship, including slapping her face in a fit of jealousy.

The handwritten letter was sold by Cynthia to a Swedish collector in 1991 and changed hands to the Swedish vendor in 1993.

Thomas Venning, the head of books and manuscripts at Christie's, said: “There are some smutty and funny bits and you sense his personality on the page, unlike his later letters which are more guarded and preachy. It provides an early insight into the Beatles from their time in Hamburg which was so important to their development as a band.”

Lennon was murdered by Mark David Chapman in New York in 1980.

The sale takes place on 9 July.

When discussing caregiving challenges with your manager, come with solutions, not just problems to be solved.GETTY IMAGES

Question: I have two young children and I'm having difficulty balancing work and family. My partner and I both work in demanding jobs, and between scrambling to pick them up from daycare and their frequent illnesses, we are both running ragged. I am ambitious and I want to advance – how can I progress in my career at this time in my life? 

We asked Marlene Lenarduzzi, chief risk officer at EQ Bank, to tackle this one: 

I know the feeling. I have three adult children, and my husband and I both had demanding careers early on. When my kids were little, I remember older women saying to me, ‘Enjoy it. It goes by so fast.' But when you're in the middle of it, it can't go by fast enough, because it really is hard. So, first off, be kind to yourself. Acknowledge that yes, this is hard, and this too shall pass. 

Next, ask for help. Use your network, your family, your friends. And don't be afraid to ask your kids to lend a hand with chores. You'll be surprised at how much they can do. Mornings are busy; everyone's trying to get up, get fed, get dressed, get out the door on time. I kept the cereal bowls, the milk and the cereal at a low level, so the kids could make their own breakfast from when they were four or five years old. It teaches them good life skills and builds their character. 

When it comes to discussing challenges with your manager, you want to be known as someone who can deliver results and come up with solutions. If you're coming to them saying, ‘I have this problem, what are you going to do about it?' That doesn't work well. But if you are coming to them saying, ‘This is how I'm going manage this time in my life,' that will go a lot further. 

So, if you need to drop your children at daycare in the morning and it's hard to get in to work before 9:00 a.m., come up with a solution that says: I will start work at nine. I will leave at 4:00 p.m. because I want to pick my children up from their after-school program. But I will log in at 9:00 p.m. once they're in bed to catch up on what I missed. If you have a reputation for coming to work with great attitude and delivering results, your manager isn't going to care that you aren't available for 8:00 a.m. meetings. I also felt that once I had children, I became hyper-efficient when I was at work. I didn't waste a lot of time. 

But I do want to say that it's also important to cut ourselves some slack and recognize that we are human. You shouldn't feel guilty about the time that you need to be with your kids, either because they're sick or you want to attend a school assembly. That's so important too. 

If you want to get ahead, don't forget your network. Make time for those connections. I know it can be challenging to have a drink with colleagues after work if you need to get your kids from daycare, but maybe you can find a lunch or a coffee in the morning to meet with people in your network. You'll find that a lot of people are in the same boat. I'm hearing just as many men saying, ‘I have to leave early today because I'm taking my son or daughter to hockey practice,' or something like that. I think there's much more flexibility and understanding for different ways of connecting. 

These women are leading in male-dominated industries – and they're hiring all-women teams

Annastacia Plaskos runs Fix It Females, a home renovation business that does everything from house painting to drywalling to building. The business rapidly grew from three to nearly 40 employees within a few years – all of them women. 

Hiring only female workers was intentional for Ms. Plaskos, who grew tired of having to prove herself to the male tradespeople she was working with, along with experiencing sexism and pay disparities in the industry. 

“For me, showing other women you can do this, that it is possible [is important],” she says. “You can make the same amount of money that a male can in this industry. It is doable.” 

Protect the sacred space of leisure from being contaminated by work 

Gloria Mark, a leading researcher on attention and distraction and University of California informatics professor, warns us to beware of leisure contamination: The tendency while taking a break to still be wrestling with work and family responsibilities. It's a mental spillover of stress into those rare moments that are meant to be restful. 

“Psychological detachment – fully detaching from stressors during leisure time – is crucial for recovery from stress. But achieving it in our always-connected, always-on, busy culture is getting harder and harder to do,” she writes on her Substack blog.

Feeling stuck in your job? How being the ‘CEO of your career' can help you get that promotion 

“Be explicit about what your goals and aspirations are. Don't assume that your manager or your organization knows what you want,” says Liz Samson, head of industry relations and operations at Square Canada. 

“Come to that conversation prepared with a list of accomplishments and their impact. It shows that you're being proactive and makes your manager's job easier. Share that list in advance to give your manager time to reflect on it. Being proactive and humble and actively asking for feedback really demonstrates a growth mindset.”

Protesters defy overnight curfew as California governor issues searing rebuke of administration. Plus, who is behind the hedonistic party palaces of New York's Fire Island?

Good morning.

Los Angeles police have announced they are making “mass arrests” in the city's downtown area, as people gathered in defiance of an overnight curfew imposed after days of protests against Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and military deployment.

Late on Tuesday night local time, the Los Angeles police department (LAPD) wrote on X that “multiple groups” continued to congregate within the designated downtown curfew area.

“Those groups are being addressed and mass arrests are being initiated,” it said.

The mayor, Karen Bass, had announced a 10-hour curfew for a square-mile area of downtown, where demonstrations against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) have continued. The LA police department has said it had carried out more than 300 arrests of protesters in the last two days.

The city's crackdown came after Gavin Newsom, California's governor, filed an emergency request to block the Trump administration from using military forces to accompany Ice officers on raids throughout LA.

Trump has ordered the deployment of 4,000 national guard members and 700 marines to LA after days of protests driven by anger over aggressive Ice raids that have targeted garment workers, day laborers, car washes and immigrant communities across the US's second-largest city.

What has Newsom said? Trump's decision to deploy the national guard in LA was “a brazen abuse of power”, that has “inflamed a combustible situation”, Newsom said in a searing rebuke of the administration.

What about Trump? In an address to troops at the Fort Bragg military base in North Carolina yesterday, Trump spread conspiracy theories, maligned California's Democratic leaders and misleadingly portrayed protesters as part of a “foreign invasion”.

Hamas has killed 50 fighters in recent months from a Palestinian gang armed by Israel in Gaza, according to a statement released amid reports that Israeli troops directly intervened this week to protect the faction.

According to media reports in Israel, clashes between Hamas fighters and members of a militia led by Yasser abu Shabab, known locally for his involvement in criminal activity, erupted early Tuesday in Rafah.

The Israeli news channel i24 reported that Israeli soldiers had clashed with Hamas members in order to protect Abu Shabab from being killed, which resulted in deaths on both sides.

Were they really armed by Israel? Yes. Israeli defence officials acknowledged last week that they had been arming the group, with the aim of undermining Hamas. Aid workers said the group had a long history of looting from UN trucks.

Elon Musk has said he “regrets” some of his posts about Donald Trump, in an apparent attempt to patch up relations with the US president. In a post on X, Musk wrote: “I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far.”

The U-turn comes almost a week after the world's richest man launched a fierce attack on Trump, calling his “big, beautiful bill” a “disgusting abomination” and alleging that Trump was implicated in the Jeffrey Epstein files, a claim denied by Trump and by Epstein's former attorney. But Musk subsequently deleted the post and several others.

Did Musk explain his change of heart? No, but Tesla's share price sank last week, with a significant impact on Musk's wealth – knocking approximately $90bn off his fortune – and on Wednesday following his statement Tesla's shares were back up 2.5% in premarket trading.

Shares have risen in China as traders appear to welcome the trade framework agreed with the US in London last night, though negotiations to resolve the wider tariff war triggered by Trump in April will continue.

The US representative Mikie Sherrill won the Democratic primary in New Jersey's race for governor. The navy pilot and former prosecutor has been a vocal critic of Trump.

A Canadian man has defied the odds to win three more lottery jackpots between August and May, accumulating about $2.5m in prize money – after his first win a decade ago.

Over the last century, Fire Island Pines, as the central square-mile section of this sandy spit off the coast of Long Island in New York is known, has evolved into something of a queer Xanadu. Now counting about 600 homes, it is a place of mythic weekend-long parties and carnal pleasure, a byword for bacchanalia and fleshy hedonism – but also simply a secluded haven where people can be themselves.

Last year, a US company called Ebb Carbon announced the world's largest marine carbon removal deal to date, signing a multimillion-dollar agreement with Microsoft to try to help fix a very real problem: ocean acidification. The sector's growth – part of the larger carbon removal market – has been astronomic, and has started to ring alarm bells for many ocean scientists across the world.

A giant crane that has blighted the skyline of Florence for almost 20 years is to finally be removed. The controversial structure, described as “a metal monster”, has stood in the centre of the Tuscan capital since 2006. Over time, the crane not only became a target of mockery, with an Instagram account set up for the purpose, but also the ultimate symbol of Italy's notoriously sluggish bureaucracy.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed off on a recommendation to the Treasury Department last month to open an investigation into Harvard University, a report says.Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is pushing to investigate whether Harvard University violated federal sanctions, The New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by the newspaper.

Rubio is pushing to investigate if Harvard violated sanctions by collaborating on a health insurance conference in China that may have included officials blacklisted by the U.S., the paper said.

The university has been conducting an internal review into the involvement of the Chinese state-run group Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps at the conference, the paper added.

Rubio signed off on a recommendation to the Treasury Department last month to open an investigation, the report said.

Analysis: Harvard versus Trump is the new battle for independence

Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.

A Treasury Department spokesman said the agency takes “any allegations of sanctions violations extremely seriously” but declined to comment on possible or pending investigations. A State Department spokesperson also declined to comment.

A Harvard spokesman declined to comment to the New York Times. Harvard University did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The Trump administration has launched a multipronged attack on the country's oldest and wealthiest university, freezing billions of dollars in grants and other funding and proposing to end its tax-exempt status, prompting a series of legal challenges.

20,000 people
      chose to be part of the Kyiv Independent community —  thank you.
    

A neighborhood in Springfield, Oregon, on June 10 renamed a local street from "Kiev" to "Kyiv" — a move initiated by members of the Kyiv Independent's global community.

Photos shared with the Kyiv Independent show the newly installed blue-and-yellow street sign, reflecting both the correct Ukrainian transliteration and the national colors of Ukraine. 

The change comes amid a broader effort by Ukraine and its allies worldwide to move away from Russian-derived place names and honor Ukraine's linguistic and political independence.

"We're very proud of our city (Springfield, OR, U.S.) for supporting our efforts to make this happen," one community member told the Kyiv Independent. 

The spelling "Kiev," pronounced "kee-yev," is the Russian version of Ukraine's capital. "Kyiv" (pronounced "keev") is the correct Ukrainian form, based on the native pronunciation and Latin transliteration.

For decades, global usage favored Russian-based spellings, a legacy of the Soviet Union's dominance and the widespread misconception that Ukrainian cities and culture were merely extensions of Russia. Even after Ukraine declared independence in 1991, much of the international community continued using names like Kiev, Lvov, and Odessa — all Russified versions.

That began to change after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and its war in eastern Ukraine. The full-scale invasion in 2022 accelerated the shift, prompting governments, media outlets, and advocacy groups to adopt Ukrainian transliterations such as Kyiv, Lviv, and Odesa.

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has promoted the change through campaigns like #KyivNotKiev, arguing that the use of correct names respects Ukraine's sovereignty and resists Russian imperial narratives.

Russian leaders, including President Vladimir Putin, have long emphasized historical ties to Kyiv in their justification for expansionist policies. Renaming streets and using correct spellings is one way communities abroad are pushing back.


          We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.
        


          More than 20,000 people chose to stand behind us. We're deeply grateful and overwhelmed with your support. Thank you for making it possible.

            • Curfew order: Police have started “mass arrests” of protesters after an emergency curfew came into effect for part of downtown Los Angeles. It will be in place from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. local time and will likely be in effect for a few days, Mayor Karen Bass said.
    


• National Guard deployed in Texas: Members of the Texas National Guard will be deployed to various locations in the state ahead of planned protests this week, Gov. Greg Abbott said. The Republican governor said the Guard “will use every tool & strategy to help law enforcement maintain order.”
    


• Growing arrest count: The number of people arrested during the protests has jumped day to day since Saturday. The LAPD chief said nearly 200 were taken into custody Tuesday – before the curfew. The mayor said that 23 businesses were looted during four days of protests.
    


• Emergency order: A federal judge has denied California's request for an immediate restraining order that would temporarily prohibit the Trump administration from using the Marines and the National Guard to enforce laws in the state, including immigration enforcement. Senior US District Judge Charles R. Breyer set a hearing for Thursday.
    


• Marines on standby: About 700 Marines have been activated to help protect federal personnel and property. They are standing by and awaiting orders outside LA, and many of them are undergoing additional training prior to assisting with the protests, US officials told CNN.
    


Our live coverage of the unrest in Los Angeles and around the US has moved here.



            A curfew is currently in place in part of downtown Los Angeles, with police saying they have begun arresting protesters Tuesday evening. Scattered demonstrations have also popped up in multiple cities across the US, with Texas deploying the National Guard in response.
    


Here are the latest developments:



            Inspired by demonstrations in Los Angeles, protesters in Texas have gathered in recent days to challenge the Trump administration's sweeping immigration crackdown.
    


            Like California, the Lone Star State is home to one of the country's largest immigrant populations. Over the past few days, demonstrators have said they are speaking out for members of their community, many who fear taking to the streets themselves.
    


            “Immigrants are the backbone of our society. Once again, they are all of us. They are our family members. They are our community members,” Laiba Khan, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, told CNN affiliate KEYE.
    


            What began as a show of solidarity devolved into chaos in Austin on Monday, when police declared an unlawful gathering outside the J.J. Pickle Federal Building, later deploying tear gas on demonstrators, KEYE reported.
    


            Another protest near the State Capitol building, also in Austin, ended with law enforcement deploying tear gas and pepper rounds, the Texas Department of Public Safety said.
    


            Thirteen people were arrested in the city, police said.
    


            About 180 miles away in Dallas, video from a Monday demonstration shows a tense standoff unfolding between protesters and police in riot gear. Several demonstrators, their faces covered with bandanas and masks, were heard shouting expletives.
    


            An observer told CNN that police used what he believes was mace on a person being restrained and another person attempting to intervene.
    


            Hundreds gathered outside San Antonio's City Hall on Sunday in a protest that remained peaceful, CNN affiliate KSAT reported. Ahead of more demonstrations in the southern Texas city, Mayor Ron Nirenberg urged residents to “exercise their rights…safely and responsibly.”
    


            Nirenberg's calls for calm come after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced the deployment of the Texas National Guard, ahead of the planned protests.
    


            “The reports of the Governor deploying the National Guard to our community underscore the need for us to remain peaceful and safe this weekend,” Nirenberg said.
    


            Members of the Texas National Guard will be deployed to various locations in the state ahead of planned protests this week, Gov. Greg Abbott said Tuesday.
    


            South Texas organizations are expected to hold anti-ICE rallies on Wednesday and Saturday, CNN affiliate KSAT reported. Among the demonstrations is a “No Kings” protest in San Antonio this Saturday.
    


            Abbott's announcement comes a day after authorities used tear gas and pepper ball projectiles to disperse demonstrators at Austin's State Capitol Complex.
    


            “Peaceful protest is legal,” Abbott said in a post on X. “Harming a person or property is illegal and will lead to arrest.”
    


            The Republican governor said the Guard “will use every tool & strategy to help law enforcement maintain order.”
    


            Photojournalist Toby Canham was covering the protests in downtown Los Angeles on Sunday when he was caught in the crossfire – and shot by a rubber bullet to the head.
    


            “I'm just standing there working, and then all of a sudden … I mean, I was sort of semi-conscious of the fact that the guy was aiming at me or aiming in my direction, and that thing traveled so quickly. Next thing I knew, I was just flattened, it struck me on the head and I was down,” he told CNN's Laura Coates on Tuesday.
    


            The rubber bullet left a large red mark on his forehead that was still visible on Tuesday. He went to the hospital afterward but wasn't otherwise injured, he said.
    


            The crowd of protesters on Sunday was large, he said, estimating it reached several thousand people at its peak.
    


            “The initial response from law enforcement, you know, there was no standoff. It was almost like straight into it with the tools at their disposal to hold people back,” he said. “And there are obviously people in that crowd angry, lashing out at police, and objects being thrown and stuff like that.”
    


            CNN has reached out to LAPD for comments.
    


            The Los Angeles Police Department said late Tuesday it had begun carrying out “mass arrests” after several protest groups continued to gather in the designated curfew zone.
    


            “Multiple groups continue to congregate on 1st St between Spring and Alameda,” the LAPD wrote on X.



                    “Those groups are being addressed and mass arrests are being initiated.”
                





            In an earlier post about an hour before the curfew took effect, the LAPD said “dozens of arrests” had been made for failure to disperse.
    


Correction: A previous version of this post incorrectly described arrests that were made after curfew. Police reported that “mass arrests” were taking place.



            Roughly 10 to 20﻿ people were seen being apprehended in the curfew area, according to CNN's team on the ground.
    


            One person was seen being physically restrained and placed on the ground, hands zip-tied behind his back.
    


            Most protesters have already left the curfew area, and police took their time to clear the vicinity, CNN's Nick Watt said from the scene.
    


            Meanwhile, a helicopter from the California Highway Patrol is flying roughly 1,000 feet above Little Tokyo in downtown Los Angeles, where the curfew is being enacted, according to flight tracking data.
    


            A curfew is in place for parts of downtown Los Angeles until 6 a.m. Pacific Time. It only applies to a small patch of the city - an area of about 1 square mile - but, according to retired Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, it may play an important role in de-escalating protests and allowing peaceful demonstrators to go home.
    


            “I think it gives officers a time to rest a little bit,” said Johnson, who led the response to the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a police officer in 2014.
    


                    “The protesters that are there legally protesting will go home. It's agitators that are still around. And so it'll separate the crowd and it gives a chance for a partnership,” he said. 
                





            LAPD officers, he added, will “give them several opportunities to disperse … But then at some point they will say, ‘This is our final order,' and they will have to go through with that.”
    


            Anti-ICE protesters gathered in Denver on Tuesday, the Associated Press reported, carrying cardboard signs including one that read “Show your faces. ICE cowards.”
    


             The group marched through different thoroughfares and disrupted traffic, with police arriving to block streets behind the marchers, according to AP.
    


            A spokesperson from the Denver Police Department told CNN they had not deployed any tear gas, contrary to some reports.
    


                    “We are contacting a large group of protesters in the area of Broadway and I-25. We're getting reports that people are saying tear gas is deployed - we have not deployed any tear gas,” she said. 
                





            A curfew has been enacted in a pocket of downtown Los Angeles, where demonstrations in the city have been concentrated. It is set to expire at 6 a.m. Pacific Time.
    


            The area is roughly 1 square mile, Mayor Karen Bass said. A law enforcement source familiar with the situation told CNN fewer than 100,000 of LA's 4 million residents will be affected, .
    


            “Any person who remains engaged in unlawful assembly or criminal activity will be detained and arrested,” the Los Angeles Police Department said in a recent post on X.
    


            Multiple lines of law enforcement including National Guardsmen and Homeland Security agents were seen stationed outside a detention facility in the curfew area, according to CNN's Nick Watt, who is on the ground.
    


                    “There are definitely people here who feel strongly about this cause,” Watt said. “There are also people, I can tell you, who are here to cause trouble.” 
                





            Nearly 200 people were arrested on Tuesday, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell told press today.
    


Watch a helicopter searchlight on the crowd in downtown LA after the curfew went into effect:



            Members of the Trump administration reacted to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's Tuesday night address, in which he warned the American people that “democracy is under attack.”
    


            In response, White House Director of Communications Steven Chung rebutted “NewScum must've hired Kamala and Biden's loser campaign team because he saying this is a ‘threat to democracy,' in a post on X.



            Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller chimed in on X stating, “The entire Democrat Party is committed to the singular proposition of migrant flooding every city in the USA.”
    


            In a post on X, White House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson called such a response “Newsom playbook 101: blaming his own incompetence on President Trump. Lame and predictable!”
    


Some context: After the governor's address was plagued by technical issues, Newsom's team apologized for a momentary silence, jokingly attributing “Trump-era transparency rules” for the delay in broadcast.
    


            Dozens of police in riot gear, holding batons, have surrounded a federal building in downtown Chicago, where a small group of protesters continue to honk and shout at officers.
    


            The scene remains tense but is much calmer compared to some hours ago, when Chicago police were in physical interactions with protesters at an intersection.
    


            Earlier video from CNN affiliate WBBM showed a car plowing through protesters on Monroe Street and Wabash Avenue during a large and mostly peaceful protest.
    


            The car appeared to clip pedestrians holding signs and a bicyclist.
    


            CNN is working to determine whether any arrests have been made throughout the day.
    


            Dozens of demonstrators surrounded Foley Square in downtown Manhattan, near a government building that houses the city's Immigration Customs and Enforcement office and main immigration court.
    


            At roughly 10:30 p.m. ET, a small group of protesters was seen surging toward police who appeared to be making arrests while blocking demonstrators off with metal barricades.
    


            The scene was relatively tame compared to just over an hour earlier, when clashes between police and protesters led to several arrests in the same area.
    


            Roughly 45 arrests have been made in New York City this evening, a law enforcement source told CNN. 



            In his address to Californians Tuesday evening, Gov. Gavin Newsom warned of the danger to America's democracy and accused Congress of bowing to President Donald Trump.
    


            “Democracy is under assault before our eyes, this moment we have feared has arrived,” he said. Trump is “taking a wrecking ball, a wrecking ball to our Founding Fathers' historic project – three co-equal branches of independent government. There are no longer any checks and balances.”
    


                    “Congress is nowhere to be found,” he added. “Speaker (Mike) Johnson has completely abdicated that responsibility. The rule of law has increasingly been given way to the rule of Don.”
                





            He urged the public to stand up for their democracy, but cautioned: “If you exercise your first amendment rights, please do it peacefully.”
    


            Johnson told reporters Tuesday that Newsom — who has aggressively criticized the Trump administration's moves — “ought to be tarred and feathered.”
    


            As protests continue in Los Angeles, about 700 Marines have been activated to help protect federal personnel and property. CNN speaks with LA residents to get their reactions.
    


            “Having troops in a civilian American neighborhood does not make anyone safer at all,” said resident Daniel Fabiano.
    


            Another resident, Priscilla Martinez, said: “I feel safe around the protests. I don't feel safe around the military at the moment.”
    


            Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass' office shared a graphic of the borders of area impacted by the curfew in downtown Los Angeles.
    


            It will be in place from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. local time. Only limited groups don't have to abide by the curfew, including law enforcement, emergency and medical personnel, people traveling to and from work and credentialed media, according to the mayor's office.
    


            Video from the anti-ICE protest tonight in New York City shows NYPD detaining multiple individuals. Several protesters can be seen on the ground as officers attempt to handcuff them.
    


            Protesters can be heard calling the officers “terrorists” as the arrests happen.
    


            President Donald Trump in his response to protests invoked a rarely used law to federalize the National Guard over the objection of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom and local officials.
    


            This law cites three reasons for that extraordinary step to be taken: the US, or any of the Commonwealths or possessions, is invaded or in danger of invasion by a foreign nation; there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the US government; or the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the US. In citing all three, the White House indicates that these protests are the equivalent of invasion, rebellion and something the US government doesn't feel like it can handle without the military. Read CNN's Zachary B. Wolf's analysis on whether Trump can lawfully take control of California's national guard.
    


Perception vs. reality: The National Guard and the Marines aren't actually allowed to conduct law enforcement. Unless Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, the guard is restricted to protecting federal property and personnel. The Marines, while mobilized, haven't yet been called in to respond. But to hear Trump tell it, his decision to call in the troops has made all the difference in putting down violent demonstrations. In a social media post, he said “If I didn't ‘SEND IN THE TROOPS' to Los Angeles the last three nights, that once beautiful and great City would be burning to the ground right now.” Read CNN's Aaron Blake's analysis of Trump's messaging on the protests.
    


Democrats in a bind: Democrats are forced back onto politically perilous turf, as they look for ways to condemn his actions without being drawn into a broad debate over immigration or tying themselves to the chaotic scenes emerging from Los Angeles.
    


Misinformation is rife: Offline, in real-world Los Angeles, most Angelenos are having a perfectly normal day. But online, the fires and riots are still raging. The powerful algorithms that fuel social media platforms are feeding users days-old and sometimes completely fake content about the recent unrest in L.A.
    


Trump defends decision: During a visit to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Trump defended sending the National Guard and the Marines to Los Angeles. “We will use every asset at our disposal to quell the violence and restore law and order right away,” Trump said. “We're not going … to wait for a governor that's never going to call and watch cities burn,” he added.
    


David Huerta: A revered California labor leader, Huerta was arrested on Friday for his involvement in protests decrying immigration raids in Los Angeles. Demonstrators came out nationwide Monday to demand his release and after three nights of detention, Huerta was released on a $50,000 bond Monday afternoon. He remains charged with conspiracy to impede an officer, a felony that could result in up to six years in prison, according to the US Attorney's Office.
    


            Immigration and Customs Enforcement posted images on X today of officers detaining individuals in Los Angeles while surrounded by National Guard troops, in what appears to be the first photos marking the Guard involved in ICE operations.
    


            The Trump administration deployed thousands of National Guard troops to California, casting it as a necessary move to quell protests in Los Angeles that erupted in a section of the city over ICE enforcement actions.
    


            Multiple sources told CNN the National Guard's focus while in Los Angeles was to protect property and personnel. They do not have authority to arrest.
    


            Images shared by ICE on X show authorities arresting individuals, as troops stand by, appearing to guard the area around the operation — in other words, serving as security perimeter. ICE dubbed the image: “Photos from today's ICE Los Angeles immigration enforcement operation.”
    


            DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that troops are on the ground to provide protection from federal law enforcement officers and property.
    


            “If any rioters attack ICE law enforcement officers, military personnel have the authority to temporarily detain them until law enforcement makes the arrest. The violence against ICE law enforcement must end,” she said.
    


            Former senior ICE officials who spoke to CNN couldn't recall any time the National Guard had been involved in an ICE interior operation.  



“Even if lawful, however, the idea of the National Guard supplementing ICE officers on interior enforcement is almost certainly a first,” John Sandweg, former acting ICE director during the Obama administration, said.
    


            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth celebrated the move on X, posting one of the images and saying: “This We'll Defend.”
    


            Officials who enacted a curfew in parts of downtown Los Angeles assess that fewer than 100,000 of the city's nearly 4 million residents actually live within the zoned off area, a law enforcement source familiar said.
    


            While numerous corporations and other businesses are based in the downtown area, the source said officials believe the 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew will affect only a relatively small number of residents, which was a factor in determining the start and end time of the order.
    


            LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell said residents of the impact area will be exempt from the curfew.
    


            Officials have stressed that nightly LA protests, which have at times turned violent, are typically relegated to a small portion of the downtown area.

            France said it has received a letter from the Palestinian Authority that contains “concrete and unprecedented commitments” to reform as Paris prepares to co-chair a conference on Palestinian statehood in New York.
    


            The letter, which France said was signed by Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas, includes condemnation of the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, a call on Hamas to immediately release all hostages, and pledges to hold elections and reform the authority, according to excerpts shared with CNN.
    


            “Hamas will no longer rule Gaza and must hand over its weapons and military capabilities to the Palestinian Security Forces, which will oversee their removal outside the occupied Palestinian territory, with Arab and international support,” the Élysée Palace cited Abbas as writing.
    


            The letter France says it received comes as anticipation builds around whether President Emmanuel Macron might recognize the State of Palestine at a summit next week aimed at building support for Palestinian statehood at the United Nations. France is co-chairing the summit with Saudi Arabia.
    


            Hussein Al-Sheikh, vice president of the PA, confirmed to CNN that the Palestinian presidency sent the letter to France.
    


            France said Abbas pledged to organize presidential and general elections within a year in order to “rejuvenate the Palestinian governance.”
    


            Abbas, 89, is deeply unpopular among Palestinians. He has led the PA since the death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in 2004 and has clung to power despite being seen by critics as lacking democratic legitimacy. Proposals put forth by Arab states for a post-war Gaza have excluded Hamas from governance and called for the reformation of the PA.
    


The Guardian reported on Saturday that France may be retreating from its plan. The conference “has weakened its ambition and will instead hope to agree on steps towards recognition,” The Guardian said, citing diplomats, adding that “French officials briefing their Israeli counterparts this week reassured them the conference will not be the moment for recognition.”

            However, an Élysée source told CNN that the French presidency refutes such reports, and that Paris is moving in the direction of recognizing a Palestinian state.
    


            “We can clearly see that some have an interest in suggesting that we are not moving in the direction of recognition. That is false,” the source said Tuesday, adding that “we are determined to recognize a Palestinian state in order to create the conditions for the state's existence.”
    


            The source highlighted the importance of the upcoming conference at the UN.
    


            “Recognizing Palestinian statehood is consistent with France's position in support of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people,” the source said. “As part of the June 18 conference, it must contribute meaningfully to the momentum behind implementing the two-state solution, based on the principles reaffirmed by the President of the Republic.”
    


            France would be the most prominent Western country to recognize Palestinian statehood. Last year, Spain, Ireland and Norway formally recognized the State of Palestine in a move that provoked backlash from Israel.

Karen Bass hits back at Trump's ‘deliberately false' claims of insurrection as reporting shows stark differences in on-ground military

There are now more US troops deployed to Los Angeles than in Iraq and Syria combined, ABC News reports.

There are 4,800 activated national guard and marine personnel in LA, compared to the 2,500 troops in Iraq and 1,500 in Syria.

Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass also just highlighted this during her press conference. She said:

There are reports that if all the military that have been designated to be deployed, if you add them all up it's more military than are serving today in Iraq.

And the money that is being spent - $134m - all of our cities could use that money.

“If you drive a few blocks out of downtown, you don't know that anything is happening in the city at all,” Bass says, again countering the image being painted by the Trump administration that the whole of Los Angeles is in a state of chaos.

“Curfews will go on as long as they are needed,” says Bass.

It is interdependent on what happens on the federal side, she adds. “If there are raids, if there are soldiers marching up and down our streets, I would imagine the curfew would continue.”

She adds that the number of arrests last night was “relatively minor” and she hopes for none tonight. “I would hope Angelenos got the message that we are serious,” she says.

Asked if there's a double standard between the Trump administration's response to peaceful protests in LA and his pardoning of January 6 rioters, Bass says:

Well I think you just illustrated the double standard.

She goes on:

And given that I was there on January 6 and saw an insurrection take place, the idea that this – what is happening here – is an insurrection is just false.

And I think it is deliberately false, I don't think they're confused.

There are now more US troops deployed to Los Angeles than in Iraq and Syria combined, ABC News reports.

There are 4,800 activated national guard and marine personnel in LA, compared to the 2,500 troops in Iraq and 1,500 in Syria.

Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass also just highlighted this during her press conference. She said:

There are reports that if all the military that have been designated to be deployed, if you add them all up it's more military than are serving today in Iraq.

And the money that is being spent - $134m - all of our cities could use that money.

Bass says the unrest is “isolated to several streets” of downtown LA, taking aim at the Trump administration's “lie” that the whole city is in chaos.

Bass highlights that, despite the Trump administration's touting of the number of arrests made during the unrest, most of those arrests have been for “failure to disperse” and curfew violation – and not for looting or vandalism, she says.

Bass says that she wants to speak with Donald Trump following days of anti-Ice protests in Los Angeles and the deployment of national guard troops and marines.

I want to speak to the president, and I want him to understand the significance of what is happening here.

Yesterday, Bass said she was going to “put out a call” to the president, but had not spoken to him yet.

She says that she has a “call in the next few minutes”, not with Trump, “but to get that call set up”.

Arturo Flores, the mayor of Huntington Park and a combat veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan as a marine, appealed directly to his active duty “brothers” deployed to Los Angeles:

These are Americans.

Whether they have a document or they don't, you're dealing with Americans.

So please remember that if you're ever put in a situation or asked to do something, remember, you are dealing with Americans.

On Monday, federal immigration agents raided a Home Depot in Huntington Park, a predominantly Hispanic city south of LA. Several day laborers were detained and residents have remained on edge, fearful of attending work, school and graduation celebrations.

Flores goes on:

When we lifted our hands and we swore the oath to defend the Constitution and to defend this country, that oath was to the American people.

It was not to a dictator, it was not to a tyrant, it was not the president. It was to the American people.

Cynthia Gonzalez, vice-mayor for the city of Cudahy, addresses Americans whom the Trump administration has made “feel like their American dream hasn't happened because of us”.

“Our community has been the scapegoat for this administration,” she says. If anything, her neighbors, documented or undocumented, helped her achieve the American Dream, she says.

If you should have anger, it should be for the gutting of Medicaid. It should be for the gutting of your Social Security. And it should be for corporate greed.

They're using our brown bodies to avoid the conversation that this administration is a failure.

Jeannette Sanchez-Palacios, mayor of the city of Ventura, says she is “outraged and heartbroken by Ice activities targeting of immigrant families in our area”.

She calls the raids “inhumane” and “an affront to the values we uphold throughout the state of California”.

She highlights immigrant labor that sustains agriculture in the region. “Every American who relies on the labor of these individuals will be affected,” she says.

She notes that these individuals made up much of the “essential” workforce who kept the state running during the Covid pandemic.

“These people are also human, at the basic level,” she says.

“We condemn the separation of immigrant families. No-one deserves to live in fear simply for seeking a better life for themselves or for there loved ones,” she says.

“We call on our fellow leaders to centre humanity at every decision they make,” she says.

“When you raid Home Depot and workplaces, when you tear parents and children apart, and when you run armored caravans through our streets – you're not trying to keep anyone safe, you're trying to cause fear and panic,” says Bass.

Deploying federalized troops on the heels of the immigration raids, was a “drastic and chaotic escalation and completely unnecessary”, she says.

The cause of the problems in the city of Los Angeles started on Friday with Ice immigration raids, says Bass.

“This was provoked by the White House,” she says, positing that “maybe we are part of a national experiment to determine how far the federal government can go in reaching in and taking power from a local governor, local jurisdiction and leaving our residents in fear.”

She is joined by more than 30 mayors from across the region. “All of us represent cities in this region where immigrants are key. And if in some cases, not the majority of the population,” Bass says.

She accuses the Trump administration of creating “fear and panic” by raiding workplaces and going after “mothers and fathers, restaurant workers, seamstress, home care workers, everyday Angelenos trying to make a living”.

“The individuals that are here with me today are all leaders in their area and we all stand in support and solidarity and call for the raids to end,” Bass says.

Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass is about to hold a press conference after a 10-hour curfew was imposed for parts of downtown LA last night. I'll bring you all the key lines here.

Leavitt says “of course” peaceful protests would be allowed to go ahead on Saturday for the military parade.

“Of course the president supports peaceful protests. What a stupid question,” she says.

Donald Trump received a phone call from Elon Musk late on Monday before the billionaire expressed regret over some of the posts he made on social media last week, according to the New York Times (paywall), citing three people briefed on the call.

Leavitt dodges a question asking what the president makes of homeland security secretary Kristi Noem's memo to the Pentagon asking it to direct members of the military to arrest or detain “lawbreakers” inside the United States.

Pressed to comment on the fact that the military is not authorized to arrest people unless the president invoked the Insurrection Act, Leavitt says “the president understands the legal authority that he invoked [in federalizing California's national guard]”.

Leavitt says California governor Gavin Newsom and LA mayor Karen Bass “need to actually do more”.

Referring to Newsom's address last night and hinting at “his future political ambitions”, Leavitt says “he spoke a lot of words, we haven't seen action”.

Donald Trump is reviewing the details of the China trade deal with his team, Leavitt says, adding that the president likes what he has learned about it so far.

Leavitt says the administration agreed to comply with the terms of the Geneva agreement it reached last month with officials from Beijing.

Summer McIntosh at the World Short Course Swimming Championships in Budapest, Hungary, in 2024.Denes Erdos/The Associated Press

Summer McIntosh came within a blink of an eye of breaking swimming's oldest women's world record at the Bell Canadian Swimming Trials on Tuesday night.

With a sold-out crowd's cheers ringing in her ears, the 18-year-old from Toronto swam the 200-metre butterfly in 2:02.26 – just .45 off the record of 2:01.81 set by China's Liu Zige in 2009. She also shaved .76 off her own Canadian record and notched the second fastest time in history in the event.

Meanwhile, four new swimmers earned selection to Team Canada for this summer's World Aquatics Championships. 

McIntosh was pleased with her swim but also believes the record remains within her grasp.

“I think this world record is the hardest one to get,” said McIntosh, who has set two world records and four Canadian records in four days. “I'm just so happy with the 2:02 low tonight. I didn't know if that was possible for me.”

McIntosh was on world record pace when she made the final turn for home.

“I was kind of upset with myself with the finish,” she said. “My last stroke was just a little bit wonky. I can definitely find the other little deficiencies through the race.

“The fact I'm knocking on the door on that world record is really encouraging. That's the one world record I never thought I would even come close to. To be pretty close to it is pretty wild.”

The two sides of Summer McIntosh, Canada's gold-medal talent

McIntosh won the 200-m individual medley on Monday in 2:05.70, lowering the time of 2:06.12 set by Hungary's Katinka Hosszu that stood for nearly 10 years. She opened the trials winning the 400-m freestyle in 3:54.18 Saturday, breaking the old mark of 3:55.38 held by Australia's Ariarne Titmus.

She broke her own Canadian record in the 800-m freestyle Sunday. Her time of 8:05.07 shaved almost five seconds off her own Canadian record and was the third fastest time ever, 0.95 of a second off the world record American legend Katie Ledecky set in May.

Ilya Kharun of Montreal picked up his second victory of the trials, winning the men's 200-m butterfly in 1:53.41.

Kharun earned a bronze medal in the 200 fly at the Paris 2024 Olympics, setting a Canadian record time. It was the first medal ever for a Canadian in the event.

Kharun said the race remains a learning curve for him.

“I'm really glad how it's progressing,” said Kharun, who swam a personal best time to win the 100 fly on Sunday. “I think it should be a lot better once we get some more work in.”

It was an emotional moment for Toronto's Ruslan Gaziev who won the men's 100-m freestyle in 48.37 seconds. That was under Swimming Canada's secondary standard of 48.82.

Gaziev is returning to swimming after serving an 18-month suspension due to an anti-doping rule violation regarding keeping his whereabouts information fully up-to-date.

“I'm just happy I won,” said the 25-year-old. “I'm honestly proud of myself and how I've handled the struggles I've had. I feel like I've really built up my resilience.”

Antoine Sauve of Montreal's CAMO club was second in the men's 100 in 48.42. Toronto's Josh Liendo was third in 48.62 followed by Filip Senc-Samardzic of Toronto in 49.13. Liendo had already earned selection in two events (100 fly and 50 free) while Sauve and Senc-Samardzic added their names to the list.

Three-time Olympian Penny Oleksiak of Toronto won her second event of the trials, taking the women's 100 free in 54.03, well under the AQUA A standard of 54.25. She swam a personal best to win the 50 free on Monday.

“I think I had a lot more in that race,” said Oleksiak, the owner of seven Olympic medals. “I'm excited to get back into training and just getting faster for the summer.”

The top four finishers in the men's and women's 100 freestyle events will be selected to join Team Canada at this summer's World Aquatics Championships. 

Finishing second in the women's 100 free was Kelowna's Taylor Ruck in 54.41, followed by Brooklyn Douthwright of Riverview, N.B., in 54.74 and Ingrid Wilm of the High Performance Centre—Vancouver in 55.15. Ruck (100-m) and Wilm (50-m) had already earned selection in backstroke events, while Douthwright earned her spot for the first time.

Para swimmers enjoyed another strong night with Alyssa Smyth, Nicholas Bennett and Sebastian Massabie all setting Canadian records. Katie Cosgriffe won the multi-class women's 100-m butterfly in 1:07.61, a time the S10 swimmer from the Oakville Aquatic Club believes she can improve on.

“There's lots of technical ways that I can be a lot faster,” she said. “I have to work on my speed in general.”

Alyssa Smyth of the Orangeville Otters Swim Club was second in the race in an S13 Canadian record time of 1:06.42.

A mix-up resulted in Smyth arriving at the pool late. She didn't have time for a warm-up before her race.

“There was a lot of adrenalin,” said Smyth. “I thought to make the best of the situation I would just try the best I could. It went pretty well.” Fernando Lu of Langley's Olympian Swimming won two races. The S10 swimmer started the evening taking the multi-class 100-m butterfly in 58.20 seconds then the 50-m freestyle in 24.44.

“It went well for me tonight,” said Lu who reached two finals at the Paris 2024 Paralympics. “I feel more energized than ever. I'm really happy with the way I've recovered from the past races.”

Massabie of the Pacific Sea Wolves broke the S5 Canadian record twice in the 50 freestyle. He swam 36.22 seconds in the morning preliminaries then 35.42 in the final. He broke the Canadian record in the S5 50-m butterfly twice on Monday.

Nicholas Bennett, an S14 swimmer with the Red Deer Catalina Swim Club, swam 57.50 to lower his own Canadian record in the 100-m butterfly.

The six-day trials, which run through Thursday, have attracted more than 700 swimmers to Saanich Commonwealth Place in Victoria.

Since assuming office, U.S. President Donald Trump has overseen an unprecedented assault on the federal government. Initially, his agent in this campaign was the tech mogul Elon Musk, who was running the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk described DOGE's mission as reducing the United States' $36 trillion in federal debt and ending the “tyranny of bureaucracy.” After a very public rift between the billionaires last week, Musk is on the outs with Trump, but the goal of downsizing the federal bureaucracy remains deeply ingrained in the administration. At the end of May, for instance, in a move not apparently initiated by Musk or his staff, the Trump administration cut dozens of staff from the National Security Council, which advises the president on international affairs and coordinates the interagency policymaking process. This move, according to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who also replaced Mike Waltz to lead the NSC, is intended to make the NSC hew more closely to “its original purpose and the President's vision.” But, according to Axios, an anonymous official put it more bluntly: “The NSC is the ultimate Deep State. . . . We're gutting the Deep State.”

Critics argue that such drastic cuts to the federal government will ultimately diminish U.S. influence in the world. Yet it is worth remembering that debates over the size and scope of the NSC and other parts of the national security bureaucracy fit squarely in a long-standing American political tradition. Indeed, the recent attacks on bureaucracy—and especially the national security bureaucracy—are reminiscent of the immediate aftermath of World War II.

With the U.S. victory in 1945, the shattering of the international order that preceded it, and the emergence of the Soviet Union as a military and ideological rival, midcentury American political and intellectual circles broadly accepted that there could be no return to Washington's pre-war military readiness or its foreign policy of relative aloofness from global affairs. But precisely what a “new normal” should look like was hotly debated. Internationalists believed the United States should maintain a robust overseas role, while conservatives were skeptical of international intervention. From those debates emerged the U.S. national security state—the collection of government agencies and organizations that focus on protecting citizens from external threats.

Thanks to its success winning the Cold War, the national security state has been treated almost as sacrosanct by the U.S. foreign policy establishment, with its logic and institutions going unchallenged and unchecked for decades. Now that the Trump administration has revived a 75-year-old debate, however, the United States has an opportunity to remember and learn from those midcentury conversations—with the most important lesson of all being that the national security state was a product both of political compromise and of the particular threat it was designed to counter. Ensuring U.S. national security in the future requires not simply reversing DOGE's cuts or restaffing various organizations but fighting for new compromises and considering new threats.

In the aftermath of World War II, as communism and Soviet power spread abroad, the priority for American policymakers of all stripes was to defend the United States' democracy and its way of life. Yet there were two distinct views on how to accomplish this, and each side felt the other's proposed policies would bring about the very calamity they aimed to prevent. Internationalists believed that the United States had to cast off its historic caution overseas and take up the mantle of international leadership that had fallen in Washington's lap. This meant, among other things, building lasting alliances, sustaining a permanent military presence abroad, and preparing for what was anticipated to be “total war” of one great power against another. Conservatives were appalled at these ideas, which in their view ran counter to traditional American political culture, represented the very sort of European imperialism America's founders had rebelled against, and militarized U.S. society in a way that would erode democracy.

Conservatives argued instead for focusing on domestic affairs, which had been relatively neglected during the war, and returning to an older approach to U.S. foreign policy—one that emphasized the Western Hemisphere and insisted on the reduction of defense budgets. In 1947, as President Harry Truman and his Secretary of State George Marshall peddled their proposal to provide billions of dollars in postwar reconstruction aid to Europe, Congressman Harold Knutson of Minnesota described the Marshall Plan as “tax-and-borrow-and-spend in other countries” and suggested the men were captive to the “intelligentsia, one-worlders, and do-gooders.” He derided supporters of the spending in his own party as “internationally-minded, ‘me-too' Republicans”—echoes of today's “RINO,” or Republican in name only, epithet. Internationalists returned the conservatives' scorn in full measure, arguing that their “Fortress America” would allow adversaries to prosper and accumulate power and that the United States could not survive as a democratic island in a communist and authoritarian world.

The end of this story is by now well known: the internationalists prevailed, their case helped immeasurably by global events, including crises in Czechoslovakia, Greece, and Turkey; the Soviet Union's successful atomic test; and the triumph of communists in China. As Truman asserted in sketching his eponymous doctrine in 1947, it would be the “policy of the United States to support free peoples,” and the United States had every intention of remaining a global and interventionist power. Yet, as detailed by the American historian Michael Hogan in A Cross of Iron, the national security state Truman and other internationalists went on to build was nevertheless the product of compromise. Despite his foreign policy leanings, Truman sought to reduce defense spending and restore balanced budgets—which were still considered an American tradition—and he stood firm against the most ambitious proposals coming from his administration, such as the unification of the military under an all-powerful commander or the institution of universal military training for Americans.

To be sure, the resulting national security system had a strong internationalist bias. The newly formed National Security Council, for example, rejected proposals to include once dominant domestic cabinet agencies such as Agriculture and Commerce—but checks on its power were included in its design. Rather than a single consolidated structure, the national security state worked via committee and coordination. Limits were imposed on both the military and the brand-new Central Intelligence Agency to prevent them from becoming more powerful. The CIA, for example, could not readily access domestic law enforcement information, nor could it participate in policy debates; and the secretary of defense received only a slim staff to allay concerns that the role would be too powerful.

But if the national security state built after World War II was designed in part to accommodate conservative concerns about imperial overreach, that compromise quickly fell by the wayside.

After the 1950s, the national security apparatus grew inexorably: the U.S. Information Agency, which aimed to influence foreign public opinion, was created in 1953; eight years later, the government created the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which administers foreign aid and development assistance, and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which provides intelligence support to the Department of Defense and the U.S. military; and other organizations devoted to preventing and resolving conflicts abroad such as the National Endowment for Democracy and the U.S. Institute of Peace were created in the 1980s. Each new body had a logic of its own, but each also pushed the United States further from its roots as a noninterventionist state.

By the 1990s, the national security state had succeeded in the mission it was designed for: to secure victory in the Cold War. Yet that success carried significant costs, many of which were predicted by conservative commentators. Conservatives of the late 1940s, for instance, worried that the creation of the national security state portended high taxes, permanent budget deficits, the growth of presidential power, and the atrophying of traditional domestic institutions such as local governments and religious organizations that had until then dominated American life. Conservatives and self-professed realists had also warned that the internationalists' logic was a recipe for fruitless conflict. The political commentator Walter Lippmann, for example, thought that the policy of containment articulated by the U.S. diplomat George Kennan played to Soviet rather than American advantages: Lippmann wrote that Kennan's strategy meant that “Moscow, not Washington, would select the ground where the conflict was to be waged, and would choose the weapons.” Washington, he believed, would be drawn into conflicts by partners about whom it knew little and would ultimately be forced either to abandon them or to indefinitely defend them at enormous cost. Although Lippmann was wrong about the failure of the United States' Cold War strategy, warnings such as these proved prescient in Vietnam and elsewhere.

Congressional conservatives made a brief comeback in the 1990s, under former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's leadership, but a full-throated debate over the national security state's merits still did not resume. If anything, the quick and overwhelming victory in the Gulf War coupled with victory in the Cold War led many to believe the United States was “uniquely capable of influencing world events,” as the Clinton administration official Martin Indyk put it. By the time of the 9/11 attacks, the national security state was primed and ready to resume its expansion. Indeed, facing an urgent crisis, the administration of George W. Bush largely repurposed, strengthened, and expanded the existing national security state, with violent Islamist extremism standing in for communism. The government created the Department of Homeland Security, the Homeland Security Council, and the office of the Director of National Intelligence and partially eased the restrictions on intelligence sharing originally meant to dampen the CIA's power. The NSC staff, which numbered 34 in the early 1970s and roughly 50 in the early 1990s, grew to over 200.

The widespread perception that Washington's post-9/11 wars—and by implication, the policy apparatus behind them—had failed to deliver gains took hold as early as the end of Bush's second term. A decade later, it had become conventional wisdom. This perception helped to finally reignite the debate that conservatives initiated in the late 1940s, along with calls to end “forever wars” and to redirect U.S. resources to domestic needs. These sentiments became the mainstream Republican view with Trump's rise to power, which occurred in parallel with the emergence of think tanks devoted to isolationism or restraint, such as the Quincy Institute and Defense Priorities.

The second Trump administration is arguably the first in which this faction of conservatives, a throwback to the days of Herbert Hoover and Robert Taft, have a major role in national security issues. After many years in exile, it should be little surprise that they have largely picked up where their political and intellectual predecessors left off and are now bringing the rest of the party with them. One-time internationalist hawks such as Rubio, for instance, are helping to lead the reorientation in U.S. foreign policy. In his first official remarks as secretary of state, he called for a greater emphasis on hemispheric issues and on internal security, and he has been eager to slash budgets and shrink the agencies he oversees, including the NSC, USAID, and the State Department. These priorities reflect a political tradition largely relegated to the fringes during the Cold War and the so-called war on terror, but one that remained alive, relevant to political debates, and deeply rooted in American society even when it was not dominant. Although its adherents are not monolithic in their views by any means, it is a tradition that differs from internationalism in that it views broad U.S. entanglement in international affairs as delivering more risk than reward, more cost than benefit.

Yet there is an incoherence to many of Trump's initiatives that would cause midcentury conservatives to blanch. Budget deficits, for example, have grown not as a result of the national security state but because of the expansion of entitlements and the growing number of Americans who qualify for them as the population ages. According to the Petersen Foundation, from 2001 to 2023, discretionary outlays, which include all spending on national security, grew from 6.2 to 6.4 percent of GDP. Mandatory outlays, which include social security, Medicare, and Medicaid, grew from 9.6 to 13.9 percent of GDP over that same period, as net interest on the U.S. debt grew from 2.0 to 2.4 percent of GDP. DOGE efforts, such as gutting USAID and the U.S. Institute of Peace, will not only fail to put a dent in this problem but ironically target spending that may be among the national security state's most efficient. For the cost of a couple of fighter jets, these agencies aim to prevent or slow the growth of conflicts and crises that, if left unaddressed, might become far more costly for the United States. These cuts also exacerbate a risk that used to alarm the sort of conservatives now in power in Washington: foreign partners may increasingly see the U.S. military as their most stable and effective counterpart in Washington. This trend is already noticeable with the rise of powerful combatant commanders in Europe, the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific.

More fundamentally, the Trump administration's efforts to kneecap the national security state have been paired with the expansion of Trump's presidential power. The unilateral imposition of tariffs is one example, but so is a more hierarchical method of crafting national security policy: presidential comments or social media posts, for example, have replaced the postwar bottom-up system. Although small-government conservatism and limits on the power of the presidency are as old as the Republic, this trend is newer and arguably began with conservative frustrations in the 1980s that President Ronald Reagan was hampered in his ability to carry out his agenda by a too-powerful Congress. Whatever the merits of Trump's campaign, the combined effect of an increase in presidential power and a dismantling of national security institutions means there will be ever-greater power concentrated in ever-fewer hands—the very outcome that postwar conservatives were determined to avert.

In the debates preceding the construction of the national security state in the 1940s and 1950s, there was a surprising degree of consensus regarding the threats faced by the United States. For all the acrimony that has attended DOGE's scorched-earth campaign against the national security state and Trump's efforts to consolidate power in his own hands, the same degree of consensus exists today: there is near unanimity among national security experts regarding the futility of recent wars and the need to focus on nuclear-armed great-power rivals—namely, China and Russia. Differences among ideological factions regarding how to address those threats are sharp, but no more so than those in the immediate aftermath of World War II. Indeed, the debates and the rhetoric are eerily similar. It is worth remembering how those earlier debates led to compromises that produced a thoroughgoing reform of the bureaucracy that, while imperfect, served American needs at a critical time.

For their part, modern-day internationalists should recognize that the national security system that won the Cold War is not sacrosanct but in need of reconsideration: it was designed for different threats in a different century, and its failings provide useful lessons for the current generation of policymakers. Merely reversing Trump's cuts and repurposing the old system for new threats—such as arguing that competition with China is a “new cold war”—is insufficient. Yet they are right that U.S. engagement in the world is more necessary than ever; any notion of retreating to our own hemisphere or carving the world into spheres of influence is nonsensical when facing adversaries with innumerable ways to cause the United States direct harm. And they are right that the nonmilitary tools of power are critical if war is to be avoided and peace won. The federal government must provide a home both to those with critical skills of the obscure sort—such as nuclear weapons scientists or pathogen researchers—and those with highly marketable expertise in emerging technologies.

Newly triumphant traditional conservatives, meanwhile, are right that a slimmer national security state could serve U.S. interests better than the bloated structure that emerged from the Cold War and the war on terror. Communication between capitals is far more direct than in the past, and the policy process must unfold more quickly to keep up with the pace of information and events. Most important, the United States must more ruthlessly prioritize given the sharp decrease in its advantages in relative power. But they should also instinctively recognize the danger in sweeping away a system that served U.S. national security well for decades, with no plan or strategy for replacing it beyond trusting in the intelligence, goodwill, and restraint of the handful of officials who accumulate power in the wake of the cuts.

Just as in the aftermath of World War II, it is not in the single-minded pursuit of either side's vision that the United States will find success, but in achieving compromise between them. The Silicon Valley ethos embraced by DOGE is often described as “move fast and break things.” Washington's ethos, however, has often been described as “in crisis, opportunity.” The breaking of the national security state is indeed a crisis, but it also creates an opportunity for the Trump administration or its successors to finally build a new national security state tailored to the world's present-day threats as well as the United States' deep-rooted and disparate political traditions.

WASHINGTON, June 11. /TASS/. Moscow has given to Washington the roadmap on return of the de-facto confiscated Russian diplomatic property in the United States, Russia's new Ambassador to Washington Alexander Darchiev said in an interview with TASS, the first one since the start of his tenure on March 26.

"As part of the permanent mechanism of regular consultations on bilateral 'irritants,' where I lead the Russian delegation, a negotiation process has been launched about the return of the six Russian diplomatic property sites, de-facto confiscated in 2016-2018," he said. "The American side has been given a 'roadmap' with realistic timeframes and a demand to provide access to these sites for inspections and assessment of damage."

In 2017, the Russian Consulate General in San Francisco, the trade mission in Washington (both state-owned) and its branch in New York (rented premises) were closed due to anti-Russian sanctions. In 2018, Washington announced the closure of the Russian Consulate General in Seattle (rented premises), as well as the residence of the Consul General (diplomatic property). Russia reacted to the seizure of diplomatic property as an openly hostile act and called on the United States to immediately return these facilities.

WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) and former State Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli (R-Somerville) won the Democratic and Republican primary contests in the New Jersey gubernatorial election on June 10 and will advance to the general election.

Ciattarelli easily beat out his Republican opponents, leading with 66.3 percent of the vote with 28 percent counted. The Associated Press called the race for him at 8:17 p.m. ET. Sherrill's race took slightly longer to call, being declared the winner at 8:39 p.m.

Los Angeles police swiftly enforced a downtown curfew Tuesday night, making arrests moments after it took effect, while deploying officers on horseback and using crowd control projectiles to break up a group of hundreds demonstrating against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

During a press conference Wednesday, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass called the raids in Southern California a provocation by the White House and urged the Trump administration to stop them.

Bass was joined by mayors from across the region, several of whom said they were immigrants.

What to know:



The commander in charge says the civilians were quickly turned over to law enforcement. 

Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman also said about 500 of the National Guard troops have been trained so far to accompany agents on immigration operations. 

Photos of guard members providing security for the agents have already been circulated by immigration officials. 

Sherman is commander of Task Force 51, which is overseeing the more than 4,000 Guard troops and 700 Marines who have been deployed to Los Angeles to provide security during the protests.

Some of those arrested in connection with downtown protests during rush hour Tuesday were charged for vandalism, police say. Four people face felony charges, including for aggravated battery against an officer of the peace.

Thousands of people demonstrated in a downtown plaza to call out the Trump administration's immigration operations and his move to dispatch dispatching the military to California.

Chicago leaders say the majority of protesters were peaceful and exercising their First Amendment rights.

Speaking at a bill-signing news conference Wednesday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott would not say how many guard members will be used or how. He added only that they will be in “strategic locations where they can provide the most robust response” if needed.

“There are others outside of this room who would like to know that. And I'm not going to tell them,” Abbott said.

Protests are planned in San Antonio on Wednesday night and in other cities around the state this weekend. San Antonio officials have said they didn't ask for the Guard to be sent.

“We want to make sure that what has happened in California does not happen in Texas,” Abbott said.

The mayor said an overnight curfew for downtown neighborhoods will remain in effect indefinitely. 

Bass said officials will consider lifting it if there are fewer arrests Wednesday night.

“What I'm hoping is that Angelenos got the message last night,” she said. 

How long it will remain in place also depends on the response by the federal government, Bass said. 

“If there are raids that continue, if there are soldiers marching up and down our streets, I would imagine that the curfew will continue,” she said.

“Maybe we are part of a national experiment about how far to determine the federal government can go in reaching in and taking over power from a governor, power from a local jurisdiction,” Bass said.

Bass was joined by mayors from across the region, several of whom said they were immigrants. 

They said immigrants are vital for the economy, including harvesting food for the country. 

“We are not criminals. We are hard working people. We came to the United States to work, to better our families,” said South Gate Mayor Maria Davila. 

Many of the city leaders said raids have been happening outside Home Depots, churches and other businesses. A woman who was nine months pregnant and a man dropping off his granddaughter were among those detained, they said.

The vast majority of people -- 203 -- were detained for failing to disperse Tuesday, and 17 others for violating the curfew that set in at 8 p.m. over part of Los Angeles, police said in a statement Wednesday.

Police arrested several more people for possessing a firearm, assaulting a police officer and shining a laser at a police “airship.”

Police said they used “numerous” less lethal munitions to control the crowd. Two officers were injured Tuesday, bringing the total number injured over the past several days of protests to nine.

At Wednesday's Houston City Council meeting, Mayor John Whitmire did not specifically mention the possibility of Texas National Guard troops being sent to the nation's fourth-largest city ahead of any protests. 

City leaders expressed their confidence in the Houston Police Department being able to monitor any protests.

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's office says National Guard troops are “on standby” in Texas in areas where demonstrations are planned. 

“We're so prepared,” Whitmire said. “We have such a great police department, a diverse police department that has so much experience. We have a history of peaceful demonstrations brought about by the faith community, our civic leaders, our political figures. And we're going to continue down that path.”

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson says the city's police have responded appropriately in managing crowds at immigration protests in recent days.

The demonstrations have been in response to aggressive immigration arrests in the city and in solidarity with Los Angeles. The largest Chicago gathering was downtown Wednesday when thousands gathered in a downtown plaza and onto surrounding streets during the evening rush hour.

There were some incidents of vandalism, and one 66-year-old woman was injured when she was hit by a car.

“The vast majority of protesters remain peaceful and organized,” Johnson said.

No officers were hit. 

Both people are charged with possession of an unregistered destructive device, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said at a press conference Wednesday.

“You can make a statement, but you can't throw bombs or Molotov cocktails,” Essayli said.

Investigators are combing through FBI videos, body camera footage from law enforcement and other evidence on social media, said Essayli. 

Authorities expect to charge more people in the coming days and weeks.






The U.S. Department of Homeland Security revealed names of nine people arrested by immigration authorities in Los Angeles on Monday and Tuesday with criminal convictions, including one for homicide and burglary and others for drug trafficking and child endangerment. 

It used those cases to portray violent criminals as its primary targets and accuse political opponents of coddling them.

“How much longer will Governor (Gavin) Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass continue to prioritize these criminal illegal aliens over their own citizens?” said Tricia McLaughlin, a department spokesperson. “Secretary (Kristi) Noem has a message to the LA rioters: you will not stop us or slow us down. ICE will continue to enforce the law and arrest criminal illegal aliens.”

Chicago police say a 66-year-old woman was injured when she was struck by a car during downtown protests Tuesday evening.

Crowds of demonstrators rallying in solidarity with activists in Los Angeles took over a plaza and some surrounding streets amid rush hour traffic. Video footage shows a car speeding through a roadway where people were standing and were protesting.

Police said Wednesday that the injured woman fractured her left arm and was treated at a local hospital.

No other injuries were reported.

Chicago police say detectives are investigating. No charges have been filed.

The defense of Newsom came as House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer were asked how Newsom should be dealing with Trump.

Jeffries said Newsom “has been doing a tremendous job on behalf of the people of California.” He then used the question to state Democrats believe along with Newsom that anybody who commits violence or destroys property should be held accountable to the full extent of that law. At the same time, people have a right to “peacefully protest and petition their government.”

Schumer said that Trump has been trying to intimidate Newsom.

“He has shown he's not going to be intimidated, and we're all for that,” Schumer said of Newsom. “All for him and proud that he is refusing to be intimidated by Donald Trump.”

The protests took place around Foley Square Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning.

Many in the large crowds, which police estimated at around 2,500 people, shouted out against federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement and waved signs that included “ICE out of NYC” as they rallied near an ICE facility and federal courthouses.

Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the vast majority of demonstrators were peaceful. She blamed smaller groups for causing the disorder that required police intervention.

Police said they took 86 people into custody, including 52 who were released with criminal court summonses for minor crimes and 34 who were charged with assault, resisting arrest and other crimes.

Some protesters clashed with police when they jumped over metal barricades and were wrestled to the ground by officers. Video also showed demonstrators throwing items at law enforcement vehicles.

About 700 Marines are still undergoing civil disturbance training at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach in Orange County, California, said Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, head of the task force that's overseeing the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles. 

Sherman wouldn't speculate about when the Marines might join the 2,000 or so Guard troops that have been deployed in downtown areas to protect federal buildings during sometimes violent demonstrations against President Trump's immigration crackdown. 

Another 2,000 Guard troops were expected to mobilize on Thursday, he said during a news conference.

The streets of downtown Los Angeles began bustling with residents walking dogs and commuters clutching coffee cups after the overnight curfew was lifted at 6 a.m. Wednesday. 

Officials said at least two dozen people were arrested for violating the curfew, but overall they were fewer clashes between police and demonstrators than on previous nights. 

There were no signs of Marines deployed to downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday, joining the National Guard troops that are protecting federal buildings and ICE agents making arrests.

A coalition of 18 Democratic attorneys general on Wednesday condemned the Trump administration for what they called the unlawful deployment of the California National Guard amid the protests in Los Angeles.

“The president's decision to federalize and deploy California's National Guard without the consent of California state leaders is unlawful, unconstitutional, and undemocratic,” the attorneys general said in a statement released by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. They said the Trump administration should be working with local leaders to keep everyone safe, “not mobilizing the military against the American people.”

In their capacity as the chief legal officers of the 18 states, they also expressed support for California Attorney General Rob Bonta's court challenge to Trump's order.

“We oppose any action from this administration that will sow chaos, inflame tensions, and put people's lives at risk — including those of our law-enforcement officers,” they wrote.

The statement was joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, and Vermont.

The hundreds who marched Tuesday evening down thoroughfares in the city, blocking traffic and chanting, were eventually told to disperse by police.

Officers used smoke and pepper balls -- similar to paintballs but filled with a substance akin to pepper spray -- to control the crowd, the Denver Police Department said in a statement Wednesday.

Three people were arrested on assault charges, according to Denver police. Other charges included graffiti, unlawfully throwing projectiles and failing to following the police's orders.

Claudia Sheinbaum said she would discuss the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary's accusation with Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau on Wednesday as he visits Mexico.

She rejected Noem's comments as “completely false” the day before, publishing a video of her in her morning press briefing calling for Mexicans to act in peace in the Los Angeles protests.

Sheinbaum added more details Wednesday — claiming her opponents had “completely taken out of context” her previous comments suggesting that Mexicans could protest a tax on remittances proposed by Trump.

“We have never called for a violent demonstration,” she said. “We are against all violent acts. We've always supported peaceful protests.”

Mayor Ron Nirenberg said city officials did not ask for the Texas National Guard to be deployed to the city ahead of planned protests Wednesday night and Saturday.

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's office said Tuesday night that National Guard troops were “on standby” in areas where demonstrations are planned. That came came after police in Austin used chemical irritants to disperse several hundred demonstrators Monday near the state Capitol.

Wednesday night's protest in San Antonio are scheduled to be near the Alamo, in the heart of the city's downtown.

San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said he has not been told by either the governor's office or the guard how many troops would be in the city, where they would be positioned or what they will be doing. The governor's office has not publicly released those details.

McManus said the city police are ready to handle any security issues with the demonstration.

“We are prepared for a peaceful demonstration, but we are also prepared if something goes south and it turns violent,” McManus said.

Immigration raids across Southern California are rattling the area's immigrant communities, even among those in the country legally. More than 100 people have been detained since Friday. 

In Orange County, a day laborer said he started carrying his green card everywhere. And during a news conference Monday, the family members of detained workers in Los Angeles urged officials to uphold the city and the state of California as places of sanctuary for immigrants.

From Seattle and Austin to Chicago and Washington, D.C., marchers have chanted slogans, carried signs against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and snarled traffic through downtown avenues and outside federal offices. While many have been peaceful, some have resulted in clashes with law enforcement as officers made arrests and used chemical irritants to disperse crowds.

Activists are planning more and even larger demonstrations in the coming days, with “No Kings” events across the country on Saturday to coincide with Trump's planned military parade through Washington.

The Trump administration said it would continue its program of raids and deportations despite the protests.

“ICE will continue to enforce the law,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted Tuesday on social media.

New York City police detained more than 80 people during protests around lower Manhattan's Foley Square against federal immigration enforcement actions Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump left open the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act, which authorizes the president to deploy military forces inside the U.S. to suppress rebellion or domestic violence or to enforce the law in certain situations. It's one of the most extreme emergency powers available to a U.S. president.

“If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We'll see,” he said from the Oval Office.

Los Angeles police swiftly enforced a downtown curfew, making arrests moments after it took effect, while deploying officers on horseback and using crowd control projectiles to break up a group of hundreds of demonstrators.

Members of the National Guard stood watch behind plastic shields, but did not appear to participate in the arrests Tuesday night.

Hours later, many of the protesters had dispersed, although sporadic confrontations continued that were much smaller than in previous nights.

The demonstrations have been mostly concentrated downtown and the curfew covers a 1-square-mile (2.5-square-kilometer) section that includes an area where protests have occurred since Friday in the sprawling city of 4 million.

Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom asked a court to put an emergency stop to the military helping federal immigration agents, with some guardsmen now standing in protection around agents as they carried out arrests. He said it would only heighten tensions and promote civil unrest. The judge set a hearing for Thursday, giving the administration several days to continue those activities.

Nearly 5,000 military personnel have been mobilized in the Los Angeles area in response to immigration raid protests. A commander says National Guard troops and Marines will protect ICE agents and federal buildings, and will be allowed to “temporarily” detain people.

Los Angeles police swiftly enforced a downtown curfew Tuesday night, making arrests moments after it took effect, while deploying officers on horseback and using crowd control projectiles to break up a group of hundreds demonstrating against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said President Donald Trump is “pulling a military dragnet” across Los Angeles during a brief public address on Tuesday. The Democratic governor's remarks come after Trump ordered the deployment of nearly 5,000 troops, including National Guard and Marines, to the nation's second-largest city. They were deployed to protect federal buildings but are now also protecting immigration agents as they carry out arrests.

DOJ officials say two individuals are accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at police officers and sheriff deputies in Los Angeles.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Police detained more than 20 people, mostly on curfew violations, on the first night of restrictions in downtown Los Angeles and used crowd-control projectiles to break up hundreds of protesters demonstrating against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, officials said Wednesday.

But there were fewer clashes between police and demonstrators than on previous nights, and by daybreak, the downtown streets were bustling with residents walking dogs and commuters clutching coffee cups.

Officials said the curfew was necessary to stop vandalism and theft by agitators after five days of protests, which have mostly been concentrated downtown. Demonstrations have also spread to other cities nationwide, including Dallas and Austin in Texas, and Chicago and New York, where thousands rallied and more arrests were made.

LA's nightly curfew, which the mayor said would remain in effect as long as necessary, covers a 1-square-mile (2.5-square-kilometer) section that includes an area where protests have occurred since Friday in the sprawling city of 4 million. The city of Los Angeles encompasses roughly 500 square miles (1,295 square kilometers).

“If there are raids that continue, if there are soldiers marching up and down our streets, I would imagine that the curfew will continue,” Mayor Karen Bass said.

The tensions in LA and elsewhere emerged as immigration authorities seek to dramatically increase the number of daily arrests across the country.




Bass said the raids spread fear across the city at the behest of the White House.

“We started off by hearing the administration wanted to go after violent felons, gang members, drug dealers,” she told a news conference. “But when you raid Home Depots and workplaces, when you tear parents and children apart, and when you run armored caravans through our streets, you're not trying to keep anyone safe. You're trying to cause fear and panic.”

Referring to the protests, she added: “If you drive a few blocks outside of downtown, you don't know that anything is happening in the city at all.”

Some 2,000 National Guard soldiers are in the city, and about half of them have been protecting federal buildings and agents, said Army Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, head of Task Force 51, which is overseeing the deployment of National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles.

About 700 Marines will soon join the Guard troops, but they are still undergoing training and will not be mobilized Wednesday, Sherman said. Another 2,000 Guard troops should be on the streets by Thursday, he said.

Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has accused Trump of drawing a “military dragnet” across the nation's second-largest city with his escalating use of the National Guard, which Trump activated, along with the Marines, over the objections of city and state leaders.

Newsom asked a court to put an emergency stop to the military helping federal immigration agents. The assistance includes some guardsmen now standing protectively around agents as they carry out arrests.

A judge set a hearing for Thursday, giving the administration several days to continue its activities.

The change moves the military closer to engaging in law enforcement actions such as deportations, as Trump has promised as part of his immigration crackdown. The Guard has the authority to temporarily detain people who attack officers, but any arrests would be made by law enforcement.

The president posted on the Truth Social platform that the city “would be burning to the ground” if he had not sent in the military.

Meanwhile in New York City, police said they took 86 people into custody during protests in lower Manhattan that lasted into Wednesday morning. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the vast majority of demonstrators were peaceful.

A 66-year-old woman in Chicago was injured when she was struck by a car during downtown protests Tuesday evening, police said. Video showed a car speeding down a street where people were protesting.

In Texas, where police in Austin used chemical irritants to disperse several hundred demonstrators Monday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's office said Texas National Guard troops were “on standby” in areas where demonstrations are planned.

Guard members were sent to San Antonio, but Police Chief William McManus said he had not been told how many troops were deployed or their role ahead of planned protests Wednesday night and Saturday.




Two people accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at police during the LA protests over the weekend face charges that could bring up to 10 years in prison, the Justice Department announced Wednesday. No one was injured by the devices.

One of the suspects is a U.S. citizen, and the other overstayed a tourist visa and was in the U.S. illegally, authorities said.




“We are looking at hundreds of people,” U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said. “If you took part in these riots and were looking to cause trouble, we will come looking for you.”

Trump has called the protesters “animals” and “a foreign enemy” and described Los Angeles in dire terms that the governor says is nowhere close to the truth.

Newsom called Trump's actions the start of an “assault” on democracy.

“California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next,” he said.

The protests began Friday after federal immigration raids arrested dozens of workers in Los Angeles. Protesters blocked a major freeway and set cars on fire over the weekend, and police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades.

Thousands of people have peacefully rallied outside City Hall and hundreds more protested outside a federal complex that includes a detention center where some immigrants are being held following workplace raids.

Despite the protests, immigration enforcement activity has continued throughout the county, with city leaders and community groups reporting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement present at libraries, car washes and Home Depots. School graduations in Los Angeles have increased security over fears of ICE action, and some have offered parents the option to watch on Zoom.

Los Angeles police detained 200 people related to the protests throughout the day on Tuesday, including 67 who were occupying a freeway, according to the city's chief. 

The majority of arrests since the protests began have been for failing to disperse, while a few others were for assault with a deadly weapon, looting and vandalism. At least seven police officers have been injured.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth opens up about the department's goals under President Donald Trump and the future of warfare on 'The Will Cain Show.'

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has authorized the voluntary departure of U.S. military dependents from locations across the Middle East, a major move as tensions spike across the region.

A U.S. defense official told Fox News on Wednesday: "The safety and security of our service members and their families remains our highest priority and U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) is monitoring the developing tension in the Middle East. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has authorized the voluntary departure of military dependents from locations across the CENTCOM AOR."

The authorization affects U.S. bases throughout the CENTCOM area of responsibility, which includes key flashpoints like Iraq, Syria, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. While the Department of Defense (DOD) has not cited a specific threat, the move comes as Iran-backed militias increase activity and regional instability grows.

"CENTCOM is working in close coordination with our Department of State counterparts, as well as our Allies and partners in the region to maintain a constant state of readiness to support any number of missions around the world at any time," the official added.

US FORCES TARGET HOUTHI WEAPONS STORAGE FACILITIES IN YEMEN OVER THE WEEKEND: CENTCOMWhile voluntary departures aren't rare, they typically kick in when a security environment worsens. U.S. doctrine, such as JP 3‑68, explicitly provides for the voluntary departure of command-sponsored dependents at government expense whenever threats rise.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt condemned the protest and riots in Los Angeles as "shameful" on Wednesday, blasting California officials for failing to reign in "left-wing radicals."

Leavitt made the comments as soon as she took the podium at a Wednesday press briefing. She emphasized President Donald Trump's efforts to quash the "mob rule" seen in the city while accusing California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of failing to serve their constituents.

"They didn't have the courage to do the right thing and protect law-abiding Californians from rioters," Leavitt said of the officials. "That's why President Trump deployed the National Guard and mobilized Marines to end the chaos and restore law and order."

"The mob violence is being stomped out. The criminals responsible will be swiftly brought to justice, and the Trump administration's operations to arrest illegal aliens are continuing unabated," she added.

Leavitt went on to field questions from reporters about the "specific criteria" that Trump used to federalize California's National Guard.

CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins argued members of the military would not be able to conduct arrests unless Trump invoked the Insurrection Act.

"As you know, the president federalized the national guard under U.S. Code 10," Leavitt responded.

Trump suggested earlier this week that he would be willing to arrest Newsom if his administration obstructs ICE operations amid riots in Los Angeles.

"He's daring Tom Homan to come and arrest him. Should he do it?" Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy asked.

"I would do it if I were Tom," Trump responded. "I think it's great. Gavin likes the publicity. But I do think it would be a great thing.  He's done a terrible job. I like Gavin Newsom. He's a nice guy, but he's grossly incompetent. Everybody knows."

Trump has also been vocal about his belief that many of the rioters and protesters in Los Angeles are professional agitators rather than real protesters.

"The people that are causing the problem are professional agitators. They're insurrectionists. They're bad people. They should be in jail," Trump said.

Newsom swiftly responded to Trump's comments in a post on social media.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pushed back against criticism from Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., who claimed during a Senate Appropriations Committee that Marines deploying to Los Angeles anti-ICE riots jeopardizes military readiness.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sparred with Democratic senators during a hearing Wednesday about the Trump administration's deployment of 700 Marines to Los Angeles amid the ongoing anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) riots. 

In his opening statement before the Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, Hegseth reiterated how President Donald Trump charged him to focus on restoring "warfighting, lethality, meritocracy, standards and readiness" to the Department of Defense – a point Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., later honed in on during his line of questioning for the secretary. 

Reed noted that the Trump administration federalized 4,000 California National Guard members and deployed 700 Marines to Los Angeles. 

Reed said what is happening in Los Angeles comes in addition to the approximately 11,000 military personnel, including active duty soldiers and National Guard members, who have deployed to the southern border in support of U.S. Customs and Border Protection – a figure which Hegseth corrected. The Defense secretary said some 13,000 military personnel have deployed to the southern border and that he has visited those troops several times.

"People will say that mobilization hurts readiness. When you talk to them, it actually improves their readiness," Hegseth said. 

Reed told Hegseth, "Your whole ethic seems to be revolved on the lethality of the military force. How is this operation with Marines and National Guardsmen improving their lethality?

"Readiness and training and accountability is all about lethality," Hegseth said. "The more ready you are, the more capable you are, the more accountable you are, the higher your standards are, it all makes you more lethal." 

"The mission in Los Angeles, as you know well, sir, is not about lethality," the secretary continued. "It's about maintaining law and order on behalf of law enforcement agents who deserve to do their job without being attacked by mobs of people. We are very proud that the National Guard and the Marines are on the streets defending the ICE agents, and they will continue." 

A Defense official told Fox News that the Marines who arrived in Los Angeles are an infantry unit and are still undergoing training, including in nonlethal weapons and use of force protocols in a domestic setting, at Seal Beach. They have not yet been tapped to respond to street demonstrations as of Wednesday morning.

Reed argued that "law and order is a civil function under the Constitution," but Hegseth said that "there is plenty of precedent for the U.S. supporting law enforcement officers." 

"What your military is doing right now is laying concertina wire, guarding buildings, maintaining vehicles for other services," Reed said. "This is not only, I think, illegal, but also a diminution of the readiness and the focus of the military."

California Gov. Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration for federalizing the National Guard to respond to the riots and for tapping the Marines. A federal judge on Tuesday night declined California's request for an immediate restraining order to block Trump's use of military personnel and scheduled a court hearing to further weigh the legality of the matter for Thursday.

In a separate line of questioning at the Senate hearing Wednesday, Hegseth said Newsom "wants to play politics." 

Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, had asked another witness, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. John D. Caine, if the United States had been "invaded by a foreign nation" or if "there is a rebellion somewhere in the United States." 

Caine deferred to the Department of Homeland Security to answer border-related questions in terms of a potential invasion and added on the question of a rebellion that, "there are certainly some frustrated folks out there." 

"It's quite easy to point out that there has been an invasion of 21 million illegals in our country under the previous administration, so this administration was elected to get a hold of that," Hegseth added. "And when you have ICE officers being attacked with concrete blocks, they should be allowed to do their jobs."

Schatz interjected, telling Hegseth he would "really like not to create a viral moment." 

The senator said he was trying to "understand the scope of the order," which, he says, does not specify a location or which Marines or which Guard members would be mobilized. 

"Did you just mobilize every guard everywhere and every service member everywhere? I mean, create the framework for that," Schatz said.

Hegseth said an initial order federalized 2,000 National Guard troops in California and there was a follow-up order for an additional 2,000 members because the situation there "required more resources in order to support law enforcement." 

"So part of it is getting ahead of a problem, so that if in other places, if there are other riots in places where law enforcement officers are threatened, we would have the capability to surge National Guard there if necessary," Hegseth said. "And thankfully, in most of those states, you'd have a governor that recognizes the need for it, supports it, and mobilizes it, him or herself. In California, unfortunately, the governor wants to play politics with it."

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Federal Aviation Administration pledged to prioritize safety and upgrade the nation's outdated air traffic control system during a Wednesday hearing with the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.

Bryan Bedford faced tough questions in the confirmation hearing, which follows January's deadly midair collision in Washington, D.C., and a string of other crashes and near misses since then.

Much of the industry, including the major airlines and their trade groups, supports Bedford's nomination. But pilots unions and Democrats have raised concerns that he might weaken pilot training standards. Bedford has been CEO of regional airline Republic Airways since 1999 and has more than three decades of experience in the industry. 

“We shouldn't have to lean into the second or third or fourth level of redundancy to keep the system moving. The system is old. It needs upgraded, massive upgrading. So we have to do better,” Bedford said during the hearing. But he said the $12.5 billion that House Republicans have included in Trump's massive bill is only a down payment on the upgrades.

The National Transportation Safety Board has said the FAA should have acted before January's crash because there had been 85 near misses reported around Ronald Reagan National Airport in the years before the disaster. The FAA has since banned some helicopter routes to make sure helicopters and planes no longer share the same airspace, but there have still been additional near misses in recent months.

FAA's acting administrator and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have acknowledged the FAA's shortcomings in not recognizing the risk and pledged to review all the agency's data to identify any similar concerns nationwide about helicopter traffic near airports. That review prompted the agency to put new limits on helicopter flights around Las Vegas' airport.




The air traffic controllers union backed Bedford's nomination because of his support for the effort to modernize the outdated system and bolster controller hiring. Two different radar outages this spring in a facility that directs planes in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport highlighted the problems because the FAA had to limit flights at the airport after five controllers took trauma leave after the problems.

Pilots' unions and Democrats have raised concerns that Bedford may support weakening the 1,500-hour experience standard for airline pilots that was adopted after a 2009 crash or even might consider allowing some airlines to operate with only one pilot. Republic previously asked for permission to hire pilots with less experience because the standard was making it hard to find enough pilots. Families of the victims of that 2009 Colgan Air crash and the D.C. crash attended the hearing.

“People are going to want to know ... whether you're going to lead any effort to change that rule,” Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell said. She asked for a firm written answer because “you helped fund and lobbied for a change for it.”

Bedford refused to commit to maintaining the 1,500-hour rule during questioning from Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois.

“What I'm saying is I don't believe safety is static,” Bedford said as he talked about how the military has changed pilot training to use more technology. Later, he said, “I can commit to you that we will not have anything that will reduce safety.”

Bedford said even if European officials have had some conversations about possibly allowing only one pilot under some circumstances, America is “a long ways away” from ever considering it. He said that's the case even as some companies are developing new technology that might be able to land a plane.

“I do think that there are ways we can absolutely use technology to improve aviation safety,” Bedford said. “I don't think it goes so far as to tell us we need to remove a trained aviator from cockpit.”

Bedford acknowledged Wednesday that “problems persist and more work needs to be done” to ensure the safety of flying around the nation's capital. He said his own airline's planes have received at least three alarms about conflicting traffic around Reagan since January.

Bedford said his priority is modernizing the air traffic control system, and he reiterated that there is no plan to privatize the system because a debate over privatization derailed Trump's previous effort to upgrade the system in his first term.

If confirmed, Bedford will also lead the FAA's effort to incorporate drones and flying taxis into the nation's airspace safely. Trump signed executive orders last week to encourage development of that emerging technology.

Fox News senior national correspondent William La Jeunesse and Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., discuss the anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles and across the country on ‘The Faulkner Focus.'

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., launched an investigation into a left-wing group in California that he says may be financially supporting violent protests in Los Angeles.

Hawley wrote a letter to the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) on Wednesday, saying the organization may have an "alleged role in financially and materially supporting" protests and riots in Los Angeles, which he described as "coordinated."

"Who is funding the LA riots? This violence isn't spontaneous. As chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime & Terrorism, I'm launching an investigation to find out," Hawley announced on social media.

The letter, addressed to CHIRLA Executive Director Angelica Salas, notes that "credible reporting" has indicated that the organization has provided "logistical support and financial resources to individuals engaged in these disruptive actions."

"Let me be clear: bankrolling civil unrest is not protected speech. It is aiding and abetting criminal conduct. Accordingly, you must immediately cease and desist any further involvement in the organization, funding or promotion of these unlawful activities," Hawley wrote.

The letter additionally requests that CHIRLA provide internal communications relating to any protest planning or funding, as well as financial documents related to the same, including third-party contracts, vendor agreements and various other business relationships.

Hawley also requested travel records for individuals involved with the organization if they have been reimbursed by CHIRLA, as well as the organization's donor lists.

IRS records obtained by Fox News show that CHIRLA has received $34 million in government grants, including three from former President Joe Biden's administration for $750,000.

President Donald Trump has already cut funding for the organization. Nevertheless, CHIRLA still receives state and city grant funds to support its lawyers fighting against deportations.

CHIRLA is also responsible for creating the so-called Rapid Response Network, the hotline immigrants use to report ICE raids. The network then sends text alerts, giving migrants an opportunity to hide.

CHIRLA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

Trump has been vocal about his belief that many of the rioters and protesters in Los Angeles are professional agitators rather than real protesters.

"The people that are causing the problem are professional agitators. They're insurrectionists. They're bad people. They should be in jail," Trump said, going on to suggest that he would support arresting California Gov. Gavin Newsom over his handling of the riots.

President Donald Trump, right, has said he believes many rioters in Los Angeles are paid agitators. 

Newsom swiftly responded to Trump's comments in a post on social media.

"The President of the United States just called for the arrest of a sitting Governor," Newsom wrote. "This is a day I hoped I would never see in America. I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican this is a line we cannot cross as a nation — this is an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism."

Ohio GOP gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy calls out the riots in Los Angeles on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'

Vivek Ramaswamy said he sees parallels between California Gov. Gavin Newsom and another controversial Democratic governor who literally stood in the way of the National Guard and had well-known presidential ambitions.

Newsom is beginning to "resemble" former Alabama Gov. George Wallace in several aspects of his response to Los Angeles' riots, Ramaswamy claimed Tuesday on Fox News' "Jesse Watters Primetime."

The Ohio gubernatorial candidate noted how Wallace – an avowed segregationist who ran for president four times – forced the hand of President John F. Kennedy by preventing Black students from attending the University of Alabama.

"[Newsom's] behavior is starting to resemble that of another Democratic governor from U.S. history by the name of George Wallace, who was the governor of Alabama, who famously stood in the way of federal desegregation," Ramaswamy said.

"The parallels are actually pretty striking, if you think about it: Democrat governors, when you look at George Wallace, he resisted desegregation. Gavin Newsom is resisting deportations. George Wallace wanted segregated cities. Gavin Newsom wants sanctuary cities. George Wallace stood in the school door, blocking the way. Gavin Newsom is blocking the ICE vans. It's the same Democrat-governor playbook."

The former DOGE co-leader said both Newsom and Wallace "dodge[d] the feds and rall[ied] the radicals."

"What they were both doing is really carving their Democratic primary path for their presidential ambitions," he added.

"Gavin Newsom's presidential ambitions are going to end in the same place that George Wallace's did: In the dustbin of history where it belongs."

In June 1963, Wallace prevented two Black students – Vivian Malone and James Hood – from enrolling on the Tuscaloosa campus of the University of Alabama and made his infamous "stand in the schoolhouse door."

NEWSOM SAYS LOS ANGELES RIOTERS WILL BE PROSECUTED, SLAMS TRUMP FOR 'TRAUMATIZING OUR COMMUNITIES'

After Wallace refused Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach's order to step aside, he delivered a pro-states-rights speech and did not budge.

Kennedy federalized the Yellowhammer State's National Guard under the Insurrection Act. Gen. Henry Graham personally confronted Wallace, who ultimately relented.

The next year, Wallace primaried President Lyndon Johnson and notably won a few northern states he had targeted on his segregationist platform – but lost to the incumbent.

In 1968, he tried again on the American Independent line with a counter-civil-rights message – splitting the Democratic vote, winning five states and helping ultimate victor Richard Nixon. During his 1976 run, he apologized for his past support for segregation.

This week, Newsom objected to President Donald Trump's federalization of the California National Guard and the ensuing deployment of 700 Marines to Los Angeles to assist in riot response.

Late Tuesday, Clinton-appointed federal Judge Charles Breyer rejected a Newsom request to block Trump's military deployments.

Newsom continued to lambaste Trump, saying in a video statement Tuesday that, "authoritarian regimes begin by targeting people who are least able to defend themselves, but they do not stop there."

Newsom also took heat for his riot response strategy from some famous Los Angeles residents, including actor Jon Voight.

"You fool," Voight fumed in an X video posted early Wednesday. 

"They [the rioters] would burn you down like they are burning the cars and the American flag."

Fox News Digital reached out to Newsom for comment but did not immediately hear back.

Protests against immigration enforcement raids have spread beyond Los Angeles to cities including Seattle, Austin, Chicago and Washington, D.C. While many have been peaceful, some have resulted in clashes with law enforcement. More protests are planned nationwide this week.

What to know:



No officers were hit. 

Both people are charged with possession of an unregistered destructive device, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said at a press conference Wednesday.

“You can make a statement, but you can't throw bombs or Molotov cocktails,” Essayli said.

Investigators are combing through FBI videos, body camera footage from law enforcement and other evidence on social media, said Essayli. 

Authorities expect to charge more people in the coming days and weeks.






The U.S. Department of Homeland Security revealed names of nine people arrested by immigration authorities in Los Angeles on Monday and Tuesday with criminal convictions, including one for homicide and burglary and others for drug trafficking and child endangerment. 

It used those cases to portray violent criminals as its primary targets and accuse political opponents of coddling them.

“How much longer will Governor (Gavin) Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass continue to prioritize these criminal illegal aliens over their own citizens?” said Tricia McLaughlin, a department spokesperson. “Secretary (Kristi) Noem has a message to the LA rioters: you will not stop us or slow us down. ICE will continue to enforce the law and arrest criminal illegal aliens.”

Chicago police say a 66-year-old woman was injured when she was struck by a car during downtown protests Tuesday evening.

Crowds of demonstrators rallying in solidarity with activists in Los Angeles took over a plaza and some surrounding streets amid rush hour traffic. Video footage shows a car speeding through a roadway where people were standing and were protesting.

Police said Wednesday that the injured woman fractured her left arm and was treated at a local hospital.

No other injuries were reported.

Chicago police say detectives are investigating. No charges have been filed.

The defense of Newsom came as House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer were asked how Newsom should be dealing with Trump.

Jeffries said Newsom “has been doing a tremendous job on behalf of the people of California.” He then used the question to state Democrats believe along with Newsom that anybody who commits violence or destroys property should be held accountable to the full extent of that law. At the same time, people have a right to “peacefully protest and petition their government.”

Schumer said that Trump has been trying to intimidate Newsom.

“He has shown he's not going to be intimidated, and we're all for that,” Schumer said of Newsom. “All for him and proud that he is refusing to be intimidated by Donald Trump.”

The protests took place around Foley Square Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning.

Many in the large crowds, which police estimated at around 2,500 people, shouted out against federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement and waved signs that included “ICE out of NYC” as they rallied near an ICE facility and federal courthouses.

Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the vast majority of demonstrators were peaceful. She blamed smaller groups for causing the disorder that required police intervention.

Police said they took 86 people into custody, including 52 who were released with criminal court summonses for minor crimes and 34 who were charged with assault, resisting arrest and other crimes.

Some protesters clashed with police when they jumped over metal barricades and were wrestled to the ground by officers. Video also showed demonstrators throwing items at law enforcement vehicles.

About 700 Marines are still undergoing civil disturbance training at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach in Orange County, California, said Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, head of the task force that's overseeing the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles. 

Sherman wouldn't speculate about when the Marines might join the 2,000 or so Guard troops that have been deployed in downtown areas to protect federal buildings during sometimes violent demonstrations against President Trump's immigration crackdown. 

Another 2,000 Guard troops were expected to mobilize on Thursday, he said during a news conference.

The streets of downtown Los Angeles began bustling with residents walking dogs and commuters clutching coffee cups after the overnight curfew was lifted at 6 a.m. Wednesday. 

Officials said at least two dozen people were arrested for violating the curfew, but overall they were fewer clashes between police and demonstrators than on previous nights. 

There were no signs of Marines deployed to downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday, joining the National Guard troops that are protecting federal buildings and ICE agents making arrests.

A coalition of 18 Democratic attorneys general on Wednesday condemned the Trump administration for what they called the unlawful deployment of the California National Guard amid the protests in Los Angeles.

“The president's decision to federalize and deploy California's National Guard without the consent of California state leaders is unlawful, unconstitutional, and undemocratic,” the attorneys general said in a statement released by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. They said the Trump administration should be working with local leaders to keep everyone safe, “not mobilizing the military against the American people.”

In their capacity as the chief legal officers of the 18 states, they also expressed support for California Attorney General Rob Bonta's court challenge to Trump's order.

“We oppose any action from this administration that will sow chaos, inflame tensions, and put people's lives at risk — including those of our law-enforcement officers,” they wrote.

The statement was joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, and Vermont.

The hundreds who marched Tuesday evening down thoroughfares in the city, blocking traffic and chanting, were eventually told to disperse by police.

Officers used smoke and pepper balls -- similar to paintballs but filled with a substance akin to pepper spray -- to control the crowd, the Denver Police Department said in a statement Wednesday.

Three people were arrested on assault charges, according to Denver police. Other charges included graffiti, unlawfully throwing projectiles and failing to following the police's orders.

Claudia Sheinbaum said she would discuss the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary's accusation with Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau on Wednesday as he visits Mexico.

She rejected Noem's comments as “completely false” the day before, publishing a video of her in her morning press briefing calling for Mexicans to act in peace in the Los Angeles protests.

Sheinbaum added more details Wednesday — claiming her opponents had “completely taken out of context” her previous comments suggesting that Mexicans could protest a tax on remittances proposed by Trump.

“We have never called for a violent demonstration,” she said. “We are against all violent acts. We've always supported peaceful protests.”

Mayor Ron Nirenberg said city officials did not ask for the Texas National Guard to be deployed to the city ahead of planned protests Wednesday night and Saturday.

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's office said Tuesday night that National Guard troops were “on standby” in areas where demonstrations are planned. That came came after police in Austin used chemical irritants to disperse several hundred demonstrators Monday near the state Capitol.

Wednesday night's protest in San Antonio are scheduled to be near the Alamo, in the heart of the city's downtown.

San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said he has not been told by either the governor's office or the guard how many troops would be in the city, where they would be positioned or what they will be doing. The governor's office has not publicly released those details.

McManus said the city police are ready to handle any security issues with the demonstration.

“We are prepared for a peaceful demonstration, but we are also prepared if something goes south and it turns violent,” McManus said.

Immigration raids across Southern California are rattling the area's immigrant communities, even among those in the country legally. More than 100 people have been detained since Friday. 

In Orange County, a day laborer said he started carrying his green card everywhere. And during a news conference Monday, the family members of detained workers in Los Angeles urged officials to uphold the city and the state of California as places of sanctuary for immigrants.

From Seattle and Austin to Chicago and Washington, D.C., marchers have chanted slogans, carried signs against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and snarled traffic through downtown avenues and outside federal offices. While many have been peaceful, some have resulted in clashes with law enforcement as officers made arrests and used chemical irritants to disperse crowds.

Activists are planning more and even larger demonstrations in the coming days, with “No Kings” events across the country on Saturday to coincide with Trump's planned military parade through Washington.

The Trump administration said it would continue its program of raids and deportations despite the protests.

“ICE will continue to enforce the law,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted Tuesday on social media.

New York City police detained more than 80 people during protests around lower Manhattan's Foley Square against federal immigration enforcement actions Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump left open the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act, which authorizes the president to deploy military forces inside the U.S. to suppress rebellion or domestic violence or to enforce the law in certain situations. It's one of the most extreme emergency powers available to a U.S. president.

“If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We'll see,” he said from the Oval Office.

Los Angeles police swiftly enforced a downtown curfew, making arrests moments after it took effect, while deploying officers on horseback and using crowd control projectiles to break up a group of hundreds of demonstrators.

Members of the National Guard stood watch behind plastic shields, but did not appear to participate in the arrests Tuesday night.

Hours later, many of the protesters had dispersed, although sporadic confrontations continued that were much smaller than in previous nights.

The demonstrations have been mostly concentrated downtown and the curfew covers a 1-square-mile (2.5-square-kilometer) section that includes an area where protests have occurred since Friday in the sprawling city of 4 million.

Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom asked a court to put an emergency stop to the military helping federal immigration agents, with some guardsmen now standing in protection around agents as they carried out arrests. He said it would only heighten tensions and promote civil unrest. The judge set a hearing for Thursday, giving the administration several days to continue those activities.

Jason Miller and Meghan Hays discuss President Trump's decision to send the National Guard to Los Angeles, comments made by Dem leaders, immigration policy reform and more on ‘America Reports.'

President Donald Trump quickly reacted to fledgling riots in Los Angeles County over the weekend by activating the National Guard, a response that drew comparisons to the summer of 2020, when widespread violence and destruction arose from Black Lives Matter and Antifa riots.

Trump's decision to federalize 4,100 National Guard soldiers and deploy hundreds of Marines came in the face of forceful objections from Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is now suing Trump over the move. Trump's deputies, however, say the National Guard was a necessary step to quash riots lest they reach the scale of the ones that occurred across the country in the aftermath of George Floyd's death on May 25, 2020.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Trump's decision would prevent a scenario like the one in Minnesota that year, when Democratic Gov. Tim Walz waited two days to call upon the National Guard to address unrest in his state.

"That's one of the reasons why these National Guard soldiers have been federalized, so they can use their special skill set to keep peace," Noem said in a recent television interview. "We're not going to let a repeat of 2020 happen, and if you remember, it all happened in Tim Walz's state, in Minneapolis… and Governor Tim Walz made very bad decisions."

Walz tried to get Trump to "bail him out" after the governor "let his city burn for days on end," Noem said.

Walz activated the National Guard in Minnesota on May 28, after looting and arson had already cropped up in the state in response to Floyd's death. Within hours of Walz announcing he had mobilized National Guard soldiers, rioters set ablaze Minneapolis' Third Precinct police station.

Although Walz ended up activating Minnesota's entire National Guard, his hesitancy prompted Trump to threaten on May 29 to federalize the soldiers "to get the job done right."

By May 30, Minnesota's National Guard announced that the governor had fully mobilized it, marking the "largest domestic deployment" in its history.

During these riots, Trump was far more deferential to governors, several of whom saw their cities ravaged by rioting, looting, arson, violence and death. The Democratic governors struggled at times to balance a law-and-order posture with their sympathy for those frustrated by police brutality.

The National Guard is a military force based in each state, and governors and presidents have shared authority over it. Governors typically have purview over their respective National Guard units, but presidents can call them into federal service in certain scenarios.

On June 3, 2020, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., pressured the Trump administration in a New York Times op-ed to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would allow the president to federalize the National Guard. The prospect was so controversial at the time that the newspaper retracted the op-ed, citing fierce blowback from its readers.

By June 4, governors in 32 states and Washington, D.C., activated a total of more than 32,000 National Guard soldiers as the chaos transpired across the country.

DHS Deputy Secretary Troy Edgar echoed Noem's remarks in a statement online on Monday, saying Trump moved so quickly because he did not want the same level of violence and damage as in 2020.

Trump and Noem "will not allow violent radicals to intimidate and shut down law enforcement in LA," Edgar said. "This isn't the Summer of 2020 2.0. I thank the brave men and women of the National Guard defending federal buildings so that immigration officials can keep us safe."

Los Angeles police swiftly enforced a downtown curfew Tuesday night, making arrests moments after it took effect, while deploying officers on horseback and using crowd control projectiles to break up a group of hundreds demonstrating against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued a curfew for downtown Los Angeles on Tuesday to stop vandalism and looting as protests over President Donald Trump's stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws continued in the city.

Several people protesting over immigration raids in Los Angeles were detained and loaded onto a police bus Monday evening as President Donald Trump ordered more National Guard troops to the city.

President Donald Trump has authorized the deployment of an additional 2,000 National Guard members to respond to immigration protests in Los Angeles, according to the Pentagon's chief spokesperson. Mayor Karen Bass criticized the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines as a “deliberate attempt” by the Trump administration to “create disorder and chaos in our city.”

Protests took place in pockets across Los Angeles over several days after the Trump administration stepped up immigration control efforts in the city. In an unprecedented move, U.S. President Donald Trump deployed National Guard troops, a move strongly criticised by the city's officials and the Governor of California Gavin Newsom.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Police arrested more than 20 people, mostly on curfew violations, on the first night of restrictions in downtown Los Angeles and used crowd-control projectiles to break up hundreds of protesters demonstrating against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, officials said Wednesday.

But there were fewer clashes between police and demonstrators than on previous nights, and by daybreak the downtown streets were bustling with residents walking dogs and commuters clutching coffee cups.

Officials said the curfew was necessary to stop vandalism and theft by agitators looking to cause trouble after five days of protests, which have mostly been concentrated downtown.

The curfew covers a 1-square-mile (2.5-square-kilometer) section that includes an area where protests have occurred since Friday in the sprawling city of 4 million. The city of Los Angeles encompasses roughly 500 square miles (1,295 square kilometers).

Some 2,000 National Guard soldiers are in the city, and about half of them have been protecting federal buildings and agents, said Army Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, head of Task Force 51, which is overseeing the deployment of National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles.

About 700 Marines will soon join the Guard troops, but they are still undergoing training and will not be mobilized Wednesday, Sherman said. Another 2,000 Guard troops should be on the streets by Thursday, he said.




Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has accused Trump of drawing a “military dragnet” across the nation's second-largest city with his escalating use of the National Guard, which Trump activated, along with the Marines, over the objections of city and state leaders.

Newsom asked a court to put an emergency stop to the military helping federal immigration agents. The assistance includes some guardsmen now standing protectively around agents as they carry out arrests.

The governor said the military presence would only heighten tensions and civil unrest. A judge set a hearing for Thursday, giving the administration several days to continue its activities.

The change moves the military closer to engaging in law enforcement actions such as deportations, as Trump has promised as part of his immigration crackdown. The Guard has the authority to temporarily detain people who attack officers, but any arrests would be made by law enforcement.

The president posted on the Truth Social platform that the city “would be burning to the ground” if he had not sent in the military.

Demonstrations have spread to other cities nationwide, including Dallas and Austin in Texas, and Chicago and New York, where thousands rallied and multiple arrests were made.

New York City police said they took 86 people into custody during protests in lower Manhattan from Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the vast majority of demonstrators were peaceful.

In Texas, where police in Austin used chemical irritants to disperse several hundred demonstrators Monday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's office said Texas National Guard troops were “on standby” in areas where demonstrations are planned.

Guard members were sent to San Antonio, but Police Chief William McManus said he had not been told how many troops were deployed or their role ahead of planned protests Wednesday night and Saturday.




Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass declared a local emergency and said the 8 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew is expected to last several days.

“We reached a tipping point” after 23 businesses were looted, Bass said Tuesday.

The curfew doesn't apply to residents who live in the designated area, people who are homeless, credentialed media or public safety and emergency officials, Police Chief Jim McDonnell said.




He said “unlawful and dangerous behavior” had been escalating since Saturday and that the curfew was needed to protect lives and property. 

Trump left open the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act, which authorizes the president to deploy military forces inside the U.S. to suppress rebellion or domestic violence or to enforce the law in certain situations. It's one of the most extreme emergency powers available to a U.S. president.

“If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We'll see,” he said from the Oval Office.

Later the president called protesters “animals” and “a foreign enemy” in a speech at Fort Bragg.

Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth.

In a public address Tuesday evening, Newsom called Trump's actions the start of an “assault” on democracy.

“California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next,” he said.

Newsom warned people against inciting violence, but he urged them to stand up to the president's actions.

The protests began Friday after federal immigration raids arrested dozens of workers in Los Angeles. Protesters blocked a major freeway and set cars on fire over the weekend, and police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades.

Thousands of people have peacefully rallied outside City Hall and hundreds more protested outside a federal complex that includes a detention center where some immigrants are being held following workplace raids.

Despite the protests, immigration enforcement activity has continued throughout the county, with city leaders and community groups reporting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement present at libraries, car washes and Home Depots. School graduations in Los Angeles have increased security over fears of ICE action, and some have offered parents the option to watch on Zoom.

Los Angeles police made 197 arrests on Tuesday, including 67 who were occupying a freeway, according to the city's chief. 

The majority of arrests since the protests began have been for failing to disperse, while a few others were for assault with a deadly weapon, looting, vandalism and attempted murder for tossing a Molotov cocktail. At least seven police officers have been injured.

Fox News Digital spoke to Hudson Institute's Michael Sobolik about the growing CCP threat to the U.S.

FIRST ON FOX: A national security-focused nonprofit organization has released a comprehensive report detailing the workings of a well-funded nominally U.S.-based organization that it says is undermining American energy, pushing left-wing green initiatives and ultimately advancing Chinese interests.

The report, published by State Armor, outlines the money trail of Energy Foundation China (EFC), registered as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that is technically headquartered in San Francisco but with employees mostly based in Beijing.

"Energy Foundation China used to be known as the Energy Foundation before it spun off most of its U.S.-based operations in 2019 into a separate organization called the U.S. Energy Foundation," the report explains. "While still formally organized as the Energy Foundation, since 2019, the organization has used the alias ‘Energy Foundation China' or ‘EF China' to differentiate from the now-separate U.S. Energy Foundation. The group was founded by Hal Harvey, a climate activist and entrepreneur with deep ties to numerous left-wing organizations and to China."

State Armor found that EFC has "spent millions each year to bankroll climate advocates who promote phasing out fossil fuels and implementing green energy alternatives like the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) and Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the latter of which was the target of a 2018 Congressional inquiry into whether it should register as a foreign agent based on its Chinese funding."

The Rocky Mountain Institute produced one of the most prominent studies used by many Democrats to justify cutting down on gas stoves and was cited by President Joe Biden's Department of Energy. 

Earlier this year, multiple committees joined to begin an investigation into EFC, and requested files from EFC President Zi Chou about financial resources given to American organizations after Fox News Digital reporting on the group funneling millions of dollars to fund climate initiatives and environmental groups in the U.S.

The report details how EFC "led a U.S. state-level legislative drive" against Bayer, the leading Western fertilizer company, that pushed for lawsuits against the company over a potentially carcinogenic pesticide with the aim of driving the company out of the U.S. and in turn forcing reliance on Chinese suppliers. 

The report goes on to outline how the organization has "provided millions" to the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) to support "a clean energy future" and how ICCT was an "active supporter" of climate initiatives in the Inflation Reduction Act targeting increased battery electric trucking infrastructure. 

Fox News Digital reported in 2023 that The Energy Foundation sent $480,000 to the Washington, D.C.-based International Council on Clean Transportation, which advocates for widespread EV adoption and policies decarbonizing the transportation sector broadly. It also wired grants — one to the University of Maryland and another to the Jackson Hole Center for Global Affairs — worth a total of $450,000 and earmarked for projects to phase out coal power reliance.

BOMBSHELL REPORT SUGGESTS 'CHINESE SPIES' INFILTRATING PRESTIGIOUS US UNIVERSITY: 'WIDESPREAD CAMPAIGN'

Josh Hodges, commissioner of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission and former national security advisor to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and NSC senior director in the first Trump administration, told Fox News Digital that EFC is a "textbook example of the CCP's asymmetric warfare strategy and drive to deepen its dominance over American companies."

"Communist China is manipulating a supposed philanthropic network to steer the U.S. away from reliable domestic energy sources and into dependence on Chinese supply chains," Hodges said. "Whether it's solar panels, mobile phones, electric vehicle batteries, or agricultural chemicals, Beijing's fingerprints are all over the 'green transition' being pushed on America."

The report quotes Chinese climate envoy Liu Zhenmin, who suggested that Biden's green energy policies will remain even under a more skeptical Trump administration and said, "even if the new Trump administration reverses climate change policies, it is unlikely to completely change the green transition actions that have already begun in various parts of the U.S."

"In other words, the CCP's penetration of the U.S.' political and industrial systems runs so deep that CCP officials believe that not even a skeptical White House could halt America's growing dependence upon Chinese technologies," the report states.

Will Hild, executive director of Consumers' Research, told Fox News Digital that the report "exposes a disturbing truth" that EFC is part of a broader push to undermine American energy independence and "stifle" the Trump energy agenda to benefit the CCP. 

"EFC is weaponizing woke ideology to pull off this scheme and force American consumers to rely on the Chinese Communist Party for energy sources," Hild said. "Americans deserve to know the truth about our foreign adversary's campaign that is poisoning our economy and reshaping our energy future. We applaud organizations like State Armor that are working to expose these grifts against consumers."

In addition to the EFC's climate activism, the report focuses on how, by "co-opting climate activism and dominating new so-called green supply chains, Beijing converts a domestic weakness into a global strength" while also detailing the ties between EFC and the CCP. 

For example, EFC's CEO Zou Ji has served in previous roles at top leadership positions in China's official National Center for Climate Change Strategy within the National Development and Reform Commission of the State Council. 

"He was so deeply tied into CCP leadership that he was included as a part of China's delegation to the 2015 Paris Climate Talks," the report says. "Zou's other affiliations include a position at Tsinghua University at a center where his colleagues include a retired senior PLA officer and a former deputy director of an MSS think tank."

Zou is not the only EFC figure with ties to the CCP, the report says, pointing to EFC board member and Washington, D.C.-based attorney Hongjun Zhang, who serves as a member of China's Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development and was previously a legislative director for the China National People's Congress. 

Zhang, according to his law firm's bio page, spent "many years in the Chinese government" that included work at the "Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), State Food and Drug Administration (CFDA), Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), and National Development and Reform Commission." 

The report states that EFC's operations in China are overseen by the CCP's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and that the organization's Beijing headquarters are located in a building owned by a state-owned investment corporation tied to Chinese state media propaganda.

Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., who is the chairman of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, sounded the alarm over the report, telling Fox News Digital, "This report confirms what we've long warned: the Chinese Communist Party is using seemingly innocuous nonprofits to influence American policy and undermine U.S. interests — in this case, our energy independence."

"Energy Foundation China operates at the direction of the CCP and is exploiting our charitable system to push policies that benefit Beijing, not the American people," Moolenaar continued. "The Select Committee continues to investigate how CCP-linked organizations infiltrate U.S. institutions, shift critical supply chains toward China, and shape environmental agendas that aim to make America weaker while China gets stronger. We will continue to expose these influence operations and work with Congress and the administration to safeguard U.S. energy security and national sovereignty."

The report also points to examples of EFC collaborating with U.S. entities and officials, including in 2023 when it "provided support" for an event that featured California Gov. Gavin Newsom during a visit to China and then hosted a forum a month later for a discussion promoting "low-carbon cooperation between the two nations."

Vance Wagner, the vice president for strategic partnerships at Energy Foundation China, pushed back on the report, telling Fox News Digital, "Energy Foundation China (EFC) is an independent grantmaking charitable organization that provides funding for research and capacity building related to climate change and China."

"Climate change is one of the greatest threats facing our world. Our work is currently focused on China given the scale of its energy sector and its role in global emissions. Despite geopolitical tensions, meaningful engagement with China on climate change and emissions reductions is in everyone's interests," Wagner continued. "All grants we make support projects related to climate change and China, and are in no way related to influencing U.S. energy policy. EFC does not accept funding from any government or political party."

"Neither the Chinese government nor the CCP fund, direct, or control EFC or our grant-making decisions," he added. "We are compliant with all U.S. and Chinese laws and regulations and do not lobby or support electoral activities in any country."

The report states that between 2020 and 2021, EFC gave over $1 million to the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for funding "green energy research" and laboratory training increasing the efficiency of China's industrial sectors. 

The Biden administration, according to the report, gave $60 million in grants to the Institute for Sustainable Communities, which is a group "frequently in collaboration with Energy Foundation China."

"America's energy security is national security," Jason Isaac, CEO of American Energy Institute, told Fox News Digital.

"The State Armor report lays bare how the Chinese Communist Party has co-opted climate activism to shift the U.S. onto so-called ‘green' technologies that are manufactured, mined, and controlled by China. From solar panels to EV batteries and rare earth minerals, our supply chains are increasingly entangled with a foreign adversary that uses forced labor, ignores environmental safeguards, and openly aims to dominate the global energy future. This isn't progress — it's dependence. Real energy dominance means leveraging America's vast domestic energy resources, not outsourcing our future to Beijing."

Along with the report, State Armor has sent letters to Republican committee chairs in Congress that call for prompt oversight on the matter. 

"Congress must act," the letter, authored by Lucci, implores. "Oversight is urgently needed to expose the full extent of this operation, beginning with Energy Foundation China. The EFC is not a passive observer; it is an active player in a geopolitical contest where America's energy security and global leadership hang in the balance."

The ICE raids in California, and the Trump administration's decision to deploy National Guard troops, to Los Angeles, touched off a wave of demonstrations and arrests other U.S. cities.

Thousands of people amassed in major U.S. cities this week to protest President Donald Trump's immigration raids in Los Angeles – injecting fresh uncertainty in the nation's capital and beyond just days before Washington, D.C., hosts a massive, first-of-its-kind military parade. 

It is unclear what, if any, major demonstrations protesters are planning in coordination with Saturday's military parade; a $45 million event running through the city's downtown which will feature hundreds of military vehicles, including armored troop carriers, tanks and Chinook helicopters, winding through the city's roads and skies in celebration of the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary.

It also happens to be Trump's 79th birthday. 

However, the show of force and military grandeur takes place at a time when a wave of immigration protests in California – and Trump's attempts to quash the unrest by deploying thousands of U.S. troops to the state – have changed the national mood from tense to combustible, prompting a new wave of demonstrations and clashes with law enforcement in major cities across the U.S.

Combined, the escalating skirmishes have also raised the specter of possible disruption during the patriotic parade, though officials stressed this week that they are closely monitoring the event and security in the surrounding area.

An immigration protest in Washington, D.C., on Monday afternoon was notably tame. However, the crowd was massive, drawing hundreds of protesters to the city's downtown area. Other demonstrations are slated to take place in the Washington, D.C.-area throughout the week, including a planned demonstration in the nearby Columbia Heights neighborhood. 

U.S. Park Police told reporters this week that they are tracking nine planned protests in Washington, D.C., on Saturday. 

Trump, for his part, attempted to get ahead of any protests that could snarl the planned display of military might, warning that any demonstrators that attempted to disrupt the event "will be met with very heavy force."

"I haven't even heard about a protest, but [there are] people that hate our country," he told reporters Tuesday afternoon.

All the same, major protests continued to crop up this week in other major U.S. cities, and clashes with law enforcement personnel prompted dozens of arrests in New York and in various Texas cities, according to local law enforcement officials.

In Washington, D.C., protesters massed peacefully outside the Justice Department headquarters on Monday to protest the administration's immigration crackdown and ICE raids.

Many were also there to demand the release of a prominent labor leader, David Huerta, who was arrested in the Los Angeles protests late last week. Huerta, the president of California's Service Employees International Union (SEIU) chapter, was hospitalized due to injuries sustained during his arrest, according to the union.

Huerta was released Monday evening on bail. He has since been charged with felony conspiracy to impede an officer, which carries a maximum penalty of up to six years in federal prison.

"We're sick and tired of the illegal acts of the administration," Jaime Contreras, the executive vice president of SEIU's Capital Area District chapter, told Fox News Digital in an interview, pointing to the administration's arrest of Huerta and also the arrest of "so many innocent immigrants" in the U.S. who have been swept up in ICE raids. 

"All they want is to provide a better life for their family, which is why your ancestors came to this country," he said.

The group, which included labor and union groups, among other protesters, marched past the Justice Department entrance and the FBI's headquarters downtown, chanting and holding signs. The demonstrators yelled, "Pam Bondi, shame on you!" as they gathered outside the entrance to the building. 

Nearby, employees at the J. Edgar Hoover Building – which since the 1970s has served as the FBI's national headquarters – could be seen watching the demonstration unfold from the confines of the building's infamously brutalist-style balconies.

"I have one word for you today – enough," said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-WA, who spoke at the demonstration in Washington, D.C., on Monday. "Enough of these mass ICE raids that are sweeping up innocent people of every legal status, tearing apart families and our communities."

The Washington, D.C., protest also took place on the same day that the Trump administration's wider travel ban officially took hold. The ban prohibits nationals from 12 countries from traveling to the U.S. and imposes partial restrictions on nationals from seven additional countries. 

Some at the demonstration told Fox News Digital they had deep concerns about the chilling effect that the ban could have on migrants in the U.S., including individuals that have already submitted visas from now-banned countries on the list.

Ultimately, Contreras told Fox News of the large crowd of protesters, "I think people are angry."

"I think that people are getting sick and tired of being threatened, of the fear factors that are being used against our community," he said.

"So yes, people are afraid— but people are also angry. And angry is a great organizing tool for all."

Beyond Washington, the demonstrations and skirmishes add heat to an already fast-boiling standoff, as both the Trump administration and many protesters have said they have no plans to stand down from the fight. 

"We'll be back," some protesters chanted on Monday.

Meanwhile, Trump officials took to social media to condemn the wave of new protests, with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem noting that ICE, which falls under her department's purview, will "continue to enforce the law."

"If you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law," she vowed.

Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how President Donald Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to LA helped quell the violence as California officials continue resistance. 

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has deployed National Guard troops across the state ahead of more anti-ICE protests.

Abbott announced the move early Wednesday in a post on X as protests sprang up in parts of Texas and across the U.S. this week.

"Texas National Guard will be deployed to locations across the state to ensure peace & order," Abbott wrote in the post. "Peaceful protest is legal. Harming a person or property is illegal & will lead to arrest. @TexasGuard will use every tool & strategy to help law enforcement maintain order."

The governor's press secretary, Andrew Mahaleris, told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement that troops would be sent to areas where mass protests are planned.

"The State of Texas stands ready to deploy all necessary personnel and resources to uphold law and order across our state," Mahaleris said. "Texas National Guard soldiers are on standby in areas where mass demonstrations are planned in case they are needed. Peaceful protests are part of the fabric of our nation, but Texas will not tolerate the lawlessness we have seen in Los Angeles. Anyone engaging in acts of violence or damaging property will be swiftly held accountable to the full extent of the law."

San Antonio Police Department Assistant Chief Jesse Salame told WOAI-TV that Chief William McManus confirmed the deployment of National Guard troops to the city, though he added that "we don't have any additional details about their deployment."

Major demonstrations popped up in cities across Texas this week on the heels of violent riots in Los Angeles to protest federal immigration raids.

In Austin, four police officers were injured trying to disperse a crowd of several hundred demonstrators that moved between the state Capitol and a federal building that houses an ICE office on Monday night. Austin police used pepper spray balls and state police used tear gas when demonstrators began trying to deface the federal building with spray paint.

Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis said three officers were injured when individuals began hurling "very large" rocks, while a fourth suffered a shoulder injury during an arrest.

"We support peaceful protest," Davis said. "When that protest turns violent, when it turns to throwing rocks and bottles ... that will not be tolerated. Arrests will be made."

Austin police arrested eight people, and state police arrested five more.

In Dallas, hundreds of protesters gathered near the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge on Monday night. The situation was tense at times, with people throwing water bottles, fireworks and rocks at police officers, FOX4 Dallas reported. 

No officers were injured during the protest. Police arrested one individual, identified as 27-year-old Gerardo Velasquez Jr., who was charged with assault of a peace officer and attempt to take a weapon from an officer.

A New Jersey tourist was gored by a bison at Yellowstone National Park after a large group of visitors approached the animal too closely, officials said. 

The 30-year-old man from Randolph was struck around 9:45 a.m. Tuesday in the Upper Geyser Basin at Old Faithful, according to the National Park Service (NPS). 

"The individual sustained minor injuries and was treated and transported by emergency medical personnel," it said. 

The incident is the second time this year a person has been injured by a bison at Yellowstone.

In the first incident on May 4, a 47-year-old tourist from Cape Coral, Fla., was gored by a bison "after he approached it too closely" in the Lake Village area, the NPS said.  

That man suffered minor injuries as well.

Park officials said, "Wild animals can be aggressive if people don't respect their space" and "It is your responsibility to stay more than 25 yards away from all large animals -- bison, elk, bighorn sheep, deer, moose, and coyotes -- and at least 100 yards away from bears, wolves, and cougars." 

"If wildlife approach you, move away to always maintain these safe viewing distances," the NPS continued. "Bison will defend their space when threatened and have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal. They are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans."

President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that the United States will get magnets and rare earth minerals from China under a new trade deal and that tariffs on Chinese goods will go to 55%. In return, Trump said the U.S. will provide China “what was agreed to,” including allowing Chinese students to attend American colleges and universities.

Vice President JD Vance and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles called Musk on Friday and urged him to end his feud with Trump, according to two people familiar with the call who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The call was first reported Wednesday by the Wall Street Journal.

Trump's lawyer argued in a federal appellate court Wednesday that the case belongs in federal court, where his administration can throw it out. The Manhattan district attorney's office — which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court, argued the contrary. 

The judges — two nominated by President Barack Obama and one by President Joe Biden — were at turns skeptical and receptive to both sides' arguments on weighty and seldom-tested legal issues. 

The one thing everyone agreed on: It is a highly unusual case. Trump lawyer Jeffrey Wall said Trump is in “a class of one.”

The judges said they would issue a ruling at a later date. 

Trump was convicted in May 2024 of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels, whose affair allegations threatened to upend his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump denies her claim and said he did nothing wrong. It was the only one of his four criminal cases to go to trial. 

All 12 members of the board overseeing Fulbright scholarships have resigned in protest of what they call Trump administration meddling with the program established by Congress nearly 80 years ago as a non-ideological, bipartisan pillar of American diplomacy.

A statement published by the board members said the administration “usurped” the board's authority by denying awards to scholars who already had been selected for the 2025-2026 academic year. 

The resignations were first reported by The New York Times. A message seeking comment was left with the State Department, which runs the international scholarship program.

“We believe these actions not only contradict the statute but are antithetical to the Fulbright mission and the values, including free speech and academic freedom, that Congress specified in the statute,” the statement said. “It is our sincere hope that Congress, the courts, and future Fulbright Boards will prevent the administration's efforts to degrade, dismantle, or even eliminate one of our nation's most respected and valuable programs.”

Trump was the first guest on a new podcast launched Wednesday by New York Post columnist Miranda Devine. She asked the president if he could reconcile with or forgive Musk.

“I guess I could,” Trump said, “but, you know, we have to straighten out the country and my sole function now is getting this country back to a level higher than it's ever been.”

Hegseth explained to the Senate Defense Appropriations subcommittee that the National Guard will be on hand to support local law enforcement and help out if protests expand to other areas.

“Part of it is getting ahead of a problem,” Hegseth said. He said most states would welcome the help but “In California unfortunately the governor wants to play politics with it.”

As of Tuesday, Trump has authorized 4,100 National Guard members and 700 Marines to deploy to Los Angeles.

Thousands of middle and high school students from all 50 states and several countries are at the University of Maryland for the 51st National History Day Competition. 

It comes as Trump targets cultural establishments, downsizing the federal government and ending initiatives seen as promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, which he calls “discrimination.”

The student's work shows how difficult scrubbing history can be. Presentations range from Brown V. Board of Education, the landmark 1954 school desegregation case, to “The Dark History of Indian Boarding Schools” and “The Thind White Line,” the 1923 Supreme Court case that denied citizenship to Bhagat Singh Thind, a Caucasian, because he was not considered white.

Executive Director Cathy Gorn says the competition's goal is to show students “that people of all kinds of backgrounds, people of all kinds of shapes and sizes and colors and ethnicities have contributed to the building of this incredible country of ours. This is a great opportunity to truly show what America is about and at the same time say hey, it's also been a struggle.”

Tennessee is challenging a decades-old federal program that provides grants to colleges with large concentrations of Hispanic students, calling it discriminatory and unconstitutional.

In a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday, Tennessee's attorney general said the Hispanic Serving Institution program excludes schools based on “arbitrary ethnic targets.” None of the state's colleges have student populations that are at least 25% Hispanic, the eligibility threshold for the program.

Joining Tennessee is Students for Fair Admissions, a group whose lawsuit led to a 2023 Supreme Court decision removing race from college admissions.

The Hispanic Serving Institution program was created by Congress in 1992. Last year its grants totaled about $350 million. Tennessee's suit argues that all universities should be eligible for the money.

The Democratic leaders of the House and Senate are defending Gov. Gavin Newsom's handling of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in California, which prompted protests and now the president's deployment of the National Guard and Marines.

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries said Newsom “has been doing a tremendous job on behalf of the people of California.” Jeffries said Democrats believe along with Newsom that anybody who commits violence or destroys property should be held accountable to the full extent of that law. But he said that people have a right to “peacefully protest and petition their government.”

Sen. Chuck Schumer said Trump has been trying to bully the governor. 

“He has shown he's not going to be intimidated, and we're all for that,” Schumer said.

Wednesday's testimony by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine complicates Trump's justification for mass deportations.

Asked if he believes the U.S. is being invaded by a foreign power, Caine said: “I don't see any foreign state-sponsored folks invading but I'll be mindful of the fact that there have been some border issues.”

Asked whether he sees evidence of “rebellion” in the country — a word that arguably justifies using the Insurrection Act to send military units into U.S. states and cities over the objections of local officials — Caine said: “There are definitely some frustrated folks out there.”

Responding to the same question, Hegseth repeated Trump's argument that “there has been an invasion” of migrants entering the country without legal permission, and he said the protests in Los Angeles could spread to other areas.

“The system is old,” Bedford said. “So we have to do better.”

Pilots' unions and Democrats have raised concerns that Bedford may support weakening the 1,500-hour experience standard for airline pilots that was adopted after a 2009 crash, or might consider allowing some airlines to operate with only one pilot. 

Senators Maria Cantwell and Tammy Duckworth pressed him on maintaining the rule, noting that he had funded and lobbied to change it while he was running an airline. Bedford refused to make that commitment.

“I don't believe safety is static,” Bedford said, adding later: “I can commit to you that we will not have anything that will reduce safety.”

Trump's pick to lead the Federal Aviation Administration is facing tough questions about safety after a string of crashes and near misses since January's deadly collision over the Potomac River.

Much of the industry, including the major airlines and their trade groups, supports Bryan Bedford's nomination. But pilots unions and Democrats have raised concerns that he might weaken pilot training standards.

Bedford has been CEO of regional airline Republic Airways since 1999 and has more than three decades of experience in the industry. He has pledged to make safety the FAA's top priority and work to restore public confidence in flying. Bedford also said he'll work with Congress on Trump's multi-billion-dollar plan to overhaul the nation's air traffic control system.

The National Transportation Safety Board has said the FAA should have acted before the crash in Washington, D.C., because there had been 85 near misses reported around Ronald Reagan National Airport in the years prior. The FAA has banned some helicopter routes to keep helicopters and planes from sharing airspace, but there have been more near misses since then.

The defense secretary confirmed reports that the Qataris have not come to an agreement with the Trump administration over a memo that would allow the Department of Defense to take possession of the 747 jet, which Trump wants as his temporary Air Force One. This also means that no contracts have been signed to move forward on overhauling the aircraft.

“A memorandum of understanding remains to be signed,” Hegseth said, while refusing to answer senator's questions on the cost or potential timeframe of refurbishing the aircraft — even though data on two other 747s being reconditioned to serve as Air Force One by Boeing is public.

Trump toured the Qatari plane in February when it was parked at an airport near Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort.

The defense secretary told senators that the Pentagon budget includes hard choices and “reflects the reality that Europe needs to step up more for the defense of its own continent. And President Trump deserves the credit for that.” 

Questioned at a defense appropriations hearing about U.S. security support for Kyiv Hegseth did not respond when asked if the U.S. will send the remaining $3.8 billion in aid already approved. 

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., warned that Russia will not stop with its assault on Ukraine and said the U.S. has to end the war. Hegseth said a negotiated peace in Ukraine will make America look strong.

Testifying in front of the House Ways and Means committee, Scott Bessent was asked about Trump's stated desire to punish Harvard University and other non-profit organizations by directing the IRS to revoke their tax-exempt status.

Federal law prohibits the executive branch from exerting influence over taxpayer audits and other investigations.

Bessent told lawmakers: “The president and I have never had a conversation about Harvard's tax status.”

Asked whether he would commit to report back to the committee in 30 days as to whether he'd been directed by the executive branch to launch audits of any taxpayers, Bessent said “that is without question that I will follow the law.”

Claudia Sheinbaum said she would discuss the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary's accusation with Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau on Wednesday as he visits Mexico. 

She rejected Noem's comments as “completely false” the day before, publishing a video of her in her morning press briefing calling for Mexicans to act in peace in the Los Angeles protests.

Sheinbaum added more details Wednesday — claiming her opponents had “completely taken out of context” her previous comments suggesting that Mexicans could protest a tax on remittances proposed by Trump. 

“We have never called for a violent demonstration,” she said. “We are against all violent acts. We've always supported peaceful protests.”

Pete Hegseth met with bipartisan criticism Wednesday as the Senate defense appropriations subcommittee hearing kicked off.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, slammed him, saying that “more of your time so far has been spent inside the building on culture wars, rather than outside the building, deterring real ones.” 

He criticized Hegseth's moves to fire the previous chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other “qualified uniformed leaders” and said the Pentagon is worried more” about each other than America's enemies.

The chairman, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, expressed frustration that the Trump administration has yet to provide Congress with a full defense budget. He said current funding isn't enough to support the nation's defense, and the administration's limited budget request has no funding for Ukraine security assistance — casting doubt on the potential for “lasting peace.”

Hegseth said he has moved quickly to kill wasteful programs and redirect funding to Trump's priorities as his department assembles a comprehensive budget request.

The new spending line was tucked inside Trump's “big, beautiful bill” by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, whose chairman Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., has been at times a Trump critic.

The $40 million allotment would go to the National Endowment for the Humanities to build Trump's long-sought statue garden. He first proposed the idea in 2020 during a time of political turmoil in the U.S. over honoring people with racist and other views, and followed up with executive orders.

Trump's initial proposal for 30-plus “heroes” features Founding Fathers and presidents, civil rights pioneers and aviation innovators, explorers and generals, and the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Absent from Trump's initial list were any Native American, Hispanic or Asian-American individuals.

The president and first lady Melania Trump plan to attend the Kennedy Center's musical at a fraught moment, after he replaced the previous leadership with loyalists, had himself installed as chairman and pledged to rid the performing arts venue of programming he has complained is “woke” and too focused on leftist ideology and political correctness.

His takeover has upset some of the center's patrons and performers. Sales of subscription packages are said to have declined, “Hamilton” canceled its planned run and other artists scrapped appearances or resigned. Understudies may perform Wednesday night due to boycotts by “Les Misérables” cast members.

In March, the audience booed Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, after they slipped into upper-level seats in the Concert Hall to hear the National Symphony Orchestra. Trump appointed Usha Vance to the Kennedy Center board along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Fox News Channel hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham, among other supporters. 

Trump signed executive orders in April relaxing some of his 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts, a significant reversal as the import taxes threatened to hurt domestic manufacturers. Trump portrayed the changes as a bridge toward automakers moving more production into the United States.

But automakers and independent analyses say the remaining tariffs could raise prices, reduce sales and make U.S. production less competitive worldwide. Last month GM lowered its profit expectations for the year, estimating the impact of remaining auto tariffs at $5 billion for the company. 

GM said it will add production of the gas-powered Chevrolet Blazer and Chevrolet Equinox, which are made in Mexico, to its plants in Spring Hill, Tennessee and Kansas City, Kansas in 2027. GM will also begin making gas-powered full-size SUVs and light duty pickup trucks in Orion Township, Michigan. 

CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday that GM is committed to building vehicles in the U.S. through 50 U.S. plants and parts facilities that support nearly 1 million American jobs.

The Netherlands-based Global Rights Compliance says Avon, Walmart, Nescafe, Coca-Cola and paint supplier Sherwin-Williams may be among companies linked to titanium sourced from Xinjiang, where rights groups allege the Chinese government runs coercive labor practices targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities.



The report found 77 Chinese suppliers in the titanium, lithium, beryllium and magnesium industries operating in Xinjiang are at risk of participating in China's “labor transfer programs,” in which Uyghur are forced to work in factories as part of a long-standing campaign of assimilation and mass detention. 

The named companies didn't immediately comment.

A U.N. report from 2022 found China may have committed crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, where more than 1 million Uyghurs are estimated to have been arbitrarily detained as China targets terrorism and separatism. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said the forced labor allegations are “nothing but a lie.”

President Joe Biden signed a law blocking imports from Xinjiang unless businesses can prove they were made without forced labor. 

Trump says US will get magnets and rare earth minerals from China in a deal imposing 55% tariffs on Chinese goods — up sharply from the 30% set in Switzerland during talks in May.

In return, Trump said the U.S. will provide China “what was agreed to,” including allowing Chinese students to attend American colleges and universities.

Trump recently had begun to clamp down on Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses.

U.S. inflation picked up a bit last month as food costs rose, though overall inflation remained mostly tame.

Consumer prices increased 2.4% last month compared to a year ago, according to a Labor Department report released Wednesday. That is up from a 2.3% yearly increase in April. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.8% for the third straight month. Economists pay close attention to core prices because they generally provide a better sense of where inflation is headed.

The figures suggest inflation remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, which would make it less likely that the Fed will cut its key short-term interest rate. Trump has repeatedly urged the central bank to reduce borrowing costs.

Last week, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the inflation data, said it is reducing the amount of data it collects for each inflation report. Economists have expressed concern about the cutback, and while it isn't clear how sharp the reduction is, most analysts say it is likely to have a minor impact. Still, any reduction in data collection could make the figures more volatile.

Trump commented on the ruling on Wednesday on his social media site, saying, “A Federal Appeals Court has just ruled that the United States can use TARIFFS to protect itself against other countries. A great and important win for the U.S.,” he wrote.

Until recently, the Army's long-planned birthday celebration did not include a big parade. Added under the Trump administration, the event, featuring hundreds of military vehicles and aircraft and thousands of soldiers, has divided veterans.

Some liken it to the military chest-pounding commonly seen in North Korea, a step toward authoritarianism or a perverse birthday party for Trump.

Others see it as a once-in-a-lifetime accounting of the Army's achievements and the military service of millions of soldiers over centuries. The parade is not about Trump, they say, but the public seeing the faces of soldiers when so few Americans serve.

The Army expects up to 200,000 people could attend and says the parade will cost an estimated $25 million to $45 million.

Trump, speaking at Fort Bragg this week, said Saturday would be “a big day” and noted “we want to show off a little bit.”

The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit extends a similar ruling it made after another federal court struck down the tariffs May 28, saying Trump had overstepped his authority.

The case involves 10% tariffs the president imposed on almost every country in April and bigger ones he imposed and then suspended on countries with which the United States runs trade deficits. It also involves tariffs Trump plastered on imports from China, Canada and Mexico to pressure them to do more to stop the illegal flow of immigrants and synthetic opioids across the U.S. border.

In declaring the tariffs, Trump had invoked emergency powers under a 1977 law. But a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled he had exceeded his power.

The tariffs upended global trade, paralyzed businesses and spooked financial markets.

Early Wednesday morning, he posted “I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far.”

Musk's break with a president whom he spent hundreds of millions of dollars to elect appeared to put an end to his influence in the White House and prompted concerns about effects on his companies. As a major government contractor, Musk's businesses could be particularly vulnerable to retribution, and Trump has already threatened to cut Musk's contracts.

Musk earlier deleted a post in which he claimed without evidence that the government was concealing information about the president's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Meanwhile, other posts that irritated Trump, including ones in which Musk called the spending bill an “abomination” and claimed credit for Trump's election victory, remained live.

On Sunday, Trump told NBC's Kristen Welker that he has no desire to repair their relationship and warned that Musk could face “serious consequences” if he tries to help Democrats in upcoming elections.

Trump's quest to erase his criminal conviction heads to a federal appeals court Wednesday. It's one way he's trying to get last year's hush money verdict overturned.

A three-judge panel is set to hear arguments in Trump's long-running fight to get the New York case moved from state court to federal court, where he could then try to have the verdict thrown out on presidential immunity grounds.

The Republican is asking the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to intervene after a lower-court judge twice rejected the move. As part of the request, Trump wants the federal appeals court to seize control of the criminal case and then ultimately decide his appeal of the verdict, which is now pending in a state appellate court.

The Manhattan district attorney's office, which prosecuted Trump's case, wants it to stay in state court.

            Being the strong favorite to win a golf tournament isn't always an easy responsibility to bear. Just ask Scottie Scheffler, who has revealed that he was forced to close his Venmo account because of bettors staking money on his performance.
    


            Ahead of this week's US Open at Pennsylvania's Oakmont Country Club, for which Scheffler is the strong favorite, the world No. 1 explained how he often hears from fans who have a financial interest in where he finishes at tournaments.

            “That's why I had to get rid of my Venmo because I was either getting paid by people or people requesting me a bunch of money when I didn't win,” he told reporters. “It wasn't a good feeling.”
    


            Asked about the biggest sum he had ever been sent as a thank you, Scheffler added: “I don't remember the most that somebody would send me. Maybe a couple bucks here or there. That didn't happen nearly as much as the requests did.”
    


            Scheffler has never won a US Open, but he enters the tournament with three wins in his last four appearances, which includes winning a third major title at the PGA Championship last month.
    


            After suffering a freak hand injury while cooking Christmas dinner and spending time away from the game to recover, Scheffler's recent results signal a clear return to form. He underlined his dominance with a four-shot victory at the Memorial Tournament in his last outing, joining Tiger Woods as the only back-to-back winners of the event.
    


            However, the 28-year-old said that he doesn't dwell on his status as a frequent pre-tournament favorite.
    


            “Starting Thursday morning, we're at even par and it's up to me to go out there and play against the golf course and see what I can do,” said Scheffler.
    


            Oakmont Country Club, which is hosting the US Open for a record 10th time, is a daunting prospect for even the world's best golfers, with fast greens and thick, unforgiving rough.
    


            Low scores are not expected this week, and Scheffler went as far as to call it “probably the hardest golf course that we'll play maybe ever.”
    


            He added: “When you talk about strength and power, I think that becomes more of a factor in these tournaments because, when you hit it into the rough, you've got to muscle it out of there.”
    


            Scheffler, seeking his fourth title of the year, tees off at 1:25 p.m. ET on Thursday in a group with Viktor Hovland and Collin Morikawa.

How to navigate a world where MAHA is setting vaccine policy.

For the past 60 years, a committee of independent experts has advised the federal government on vaccine policy, providing guidance on which shots people should get and when. Government public health officials have almost always followed the panel's recommendations, all but making it the final word on public health policy in the US for most of its existence. And over those decades, the United States has made tremendous health gains over that time through mass vaccination campaigns.

But on Monday, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired every sitting member of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a move that stunned doctors and scientists across the country. And it means that the CDC's days as the clear and unchallenged authority on US vaccine policy appear numbered.

“Up until today, ACIP recommendations were the gold standard for what insurers should pay for, what providers should recommend, and what the public should look to,” Noel Brewer, a health behavior professor at the University of North Carolina, who was a member of the panel until this week, told the Associated Press. “It's unclear what the future holds.”

New committee members will be announced at some point, but as of Tuesday morning, even top US senators did not know who the replacements would be. The panel is supposed to hold one of its periodic public meetings in late June to discuss the Covid-19 vaccine, as well as shots for RSV and HPV, among others. 

This is a watershed moment in US public health, one that seems sure to sow confusion among patients and health care providers. The deepening divide between Kennedy's Make American Healthy Again (MAHA) movement and mainstream medicine could make it harder for people who want vaccines to get them, while encouraging more doubt about the value and safety of shots among the general public. Here's what you need to know.

The vaccine advisory committee was first convened by the surgeon general in 1964, but it is not enshrined in federal law. That means that Kennedy — as the top official at the US Department of Health and Human Services, which contains the CDC — can change its membership or dissolve the panel entirely if he so desires. 

Kennedy framed his decision to clear out the members as necessary to restore public trust in the government's vaccine recommendations. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Kennedy asserted the committee “has been plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.” 

It may be a little “hot dog guy meme” that the man who may have done more than any other person to erode public trust in vaccines is now complaining about the problem of eroding public trust in vaccines. But it fits with his broader critique of the medical establishment being beholden to big business interests at the expense of patients, a critique that many Americans share. Kennedy has said mainstream scientists — the kind who staffed ACIP before this week — have been too deferential to pharma companies and too reluctant to consider vaccines' supposed harms, including the long-debunked claim that vaccines can cause autism, which Kennedy has pushed for years.

As health secretary, he has made overhauling vaccine policy a centerpiece of his agenda, both through his rhetoric and policy. Over the past few months, while the worst measles outbreak in 30 years has spread through the US, Kennedy has equivocated in public comments on the value of the measles vaccine, which doctors say is far and away the best tool to combat the disease. He directed an anti-vaccine researcher to scour federal data for evidence of a vaccine-autism link. His department's recent MAHA report on childhood chronic disease named vaccines as one example of how the US overmedicalizes its children and exposes them to artificial agents that could do harm to their body.

Then in late May, Kennedy oversaw a revision of the federal government's Covid-19 vaccine guidance, limiting the shots to elderly people and those who are immunocompromised. He ended the recommendation that pregnant women and kids get a Covid vaccine shot, even though studies have shown they help confer immunity to infants, who are at a higher risk from the virus and cannot be vaccinated until they are 6 months old. The move plainly circumvented ACIP's accepted role in setting vaccine policy, presaging this week's mass firing.

Whatever his intentions, Kennedy's gutting of the federal vaccine committee seems likely to sow even more distrust — and certainly more confusion. People are reasonably left to wonder whether they can trust forthcoming CDC guidance on vaccines, and just what vaccines they'll be able to get.

In the past, ACIP would typically meet a few times a year to discuss any additions or changes to the country's vaccine schedule. Their recommendations have usually been adopted without alterations by the CDC director, and then became the standard for state and local health departments across the country. Importantly, most health plans are required to cover any shots that the committee recommends. 

Now there is far more uncertainty. Will doctors follow the CDC guidance, even if it changes under a new advisory panel staffed by Kennedy loyalists, or will they stick with the earlier vaccine schedule? Will health insurance plans cover the cost of a vaccine that professional medical organizations support but the CDC does not? Once-unthinkable questions could soon be something doctors and patients must deal with every day.

Some doctors already believed, before the firings at ACIP, that the CDC was no longer trustworthy under Kennedy's leadership; his unilateral change to the Covid vaccine guidance in May was enough to convince them. In a media call last week, experts from the Infectious Disease Society of America urged patients and providers in the short term to consult with professional medical societies — not the CDC — on vaccine recommendations. They considered those groups, as well as guidance from European health authorities, the best substitutes we currently have for information on vaccines if the CDC's recommendations can no longer be taken at face value.

“It's been a confusing several days, confusing last two weeks, and I'm not sure that confusion is going to be abated in the near future,” John Lynch, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Washington, said on the call. 

Lynch said that he tells his own colleagues to consult with the IDSA, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG). There are already differences emerging: Kennedy recently nixed the government's recommendation that pregnant women get the Covid-19 vaccine, while ACOG continues to recommend it because the mother can pass on immunity to their child. And more could surface: The AAP currently recommends Gardasil for the HPV virus, which has proven successful in preventing cervical cancer, but Kennedy has expressed concerns about its safety.

“These are evidence-based guidelines developed by experts in the field using transparent methods and published publicly,” Lynch said.

Kennedy, in explaining his change to the Covid vaccine guidelines, said he wanted to encourage shared decision-making between providers and their patients. The CDC guidance would be only one consideration in the decision whether to vaccinate, rather than a firm recommendation. The doctors from the IDSA said that such conversations are already to be considered best practice among physicians — and noted Kennedy's undermining of trust in the federal vaccine policy would now make them more important. 

“I would just emphasize the need to have a good source of information when this situation occurs. If indeed shared decision making is going to occur, we always do our research,” Dr. Flor Muñoz-Rivas at Baylor College of Medicine said. “But go to the proper sources.” 

There is a lot we don't know right now: Who will be named to the new panel? Will they change existing vaccine recommendations? Will they approve new ones? But the experts warned that Kennedy's rhetoric alone risks undermining people's confidence in vaccinations.

“All health care decisions are shared decision-making; this is not a special concept that's only rolled out for conversations like vaccination,” Lynch said on the IDSA call. “As an infectious disease doctor, when I talk to a patient about treatment or diagnostics, it is a conversation. It is shared decision-making.”

Kennedy has quickly disrupted decades of public health consensus.

Anyone who watched the sometimes contentious ACIP meetings during the pandemic saw the members grappling with genuinely vexing questions about who should be prioritized for vaccination in a public health emergency. The pandemic featured rare examples of Biden CDC director Rochelle Walensky overruling the panel in certain cases in which the experts actually recommended against more vaccinations. (Walensky said she overrode the guidance to align the CDC with a separate recommendation from the FDA's advisory committee, and cited the narrow 9-6 vote against the recommendation.) Those scenes should have helped dispel the notion that they were acting as a rubber-stamp for any new shot Big Pharma produced.

But the nation's top health official is now telling Americans that they should never have trusted the ACIP, which risks pushing more people to skip routine immunization. Shortly after the country declared measles eradicated in 2000, 94 percent of adults said childhood immunizations were extremely or very important. But that consensus has since weakened: 69 percent of Americans said the same in 2024. If changing opinion leads to declining vaccination rates, diseases that we successfully stamped out through vaccines to rebound — which is exactly what we are seeing now with measles. 

The US is experiencing its highest number of measles cases since the 1990s, nearing 1,200 as of this writing. One outbreak that accounts for most of those cases took off in a small Texas community where vaccination rates had fallen far below the 95-percent threshold that is considered necessary to stop the virus's spread.

Other knock on effects could hurt Americans who still want to get vaccinated. Pharma companies, the target of so much of Kennedy's criticism, could decide to stop pursuing new vaccines if they believe the federal government will limit access as much as possible, shrinking the world's biggest pharmaceutical market. Vaccines are not big moneymakers for drug companies, and they have often relied on the US government's support to develop new ones. 

Kennedy, however, has canceled major vaccine development contracts during his first few months as health secretary, including a $700 million contract with Moderna, one of two companies that produced the mRNA Covid vaccines, to work on a universal flu shot.

Kennedy has quickly disrupted decades of public health consensus. For now, the best reaction is, oddly enough, for patients and providers to take him at his word when he says people should not take medical advice from him — and make their own decisions in collaboration with their doctors.

            House Republicans are touting that their sweeping tax and spending cuts package would kick many “illegal immigrants” off federal assistance, fulfilling one of President Donald Trump's top priorities.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson has repeatedly emphasized that the bill would stop 1.4 million “illegal aliens” from accessing Medicaid. The tax portion of the package has a section on “removing taxpayer benefits from illegal immigrants.” And the House Agriculture Committee crafted a provision to restrict food stamp eligibility for “illegal aliens.”
    


            However, undocumented immigrants in the US won't be as heavily affected by the legislation since they already can't access nearly all federal government assistance programs, experts say. Those more in danger of losing some benefits are millions of legal immigrants, as well as children who are citizens but whose parents may be undocumented or have various legal statuses.

House GOP lawmakers are proposing nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and food stamps. Here's who could be impacted



            “It's part of a campaign of misinformation,” said Tanya Broder, senior counsel of health and economic justice at the National Immigration Law Center. “This bill would deny eligibility to lawfully residing immigrants who have authorization to live and work in the US and who pay taxes that support the services that we all depend on.”
    


            The legislation, which is now in the Senate, where it may be changed, would greatly limit the categories of legal immigrants who can qualify for a variety of federal benefits, including the child tax credit, food stamps, Affordable Care Act subsidies and Medicare. It also takes aim at states that provide Medicaid-like coverage to undocumented immigrants with their own funds.
    


            Currently, immigrants' eligibility for federal benefits depends on their status, of which there are many categories. Among those authorized to be in the US, certain groups can qualify right away, others must wait several years. Some immigrant children and pregnant women can access Medicaid sooner if states opt to allow them. But immigrants with other legal statuses do not qualify for any public assistance. (All of them must also meet the other eligibility criteria for the benefit programs, including income limits.)
    


            Undocumented immigrants generally only qualify for what's known as Emergency Medicaid, which reimburses hospitals for the emergency care they are required to provide. These patients would have to be eligible for Medicaid were it not for their immigration status. Separately, some states provide health coverage to certain undocumented immigrants, most commonly children, using only state funds.
    


            At least one advocate for tighter controls on immigration thinks the House GOP bill misses the mark. Taking away benefits from immigrants already in the US does not address the underlying problem of illegal immigration, said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies.
    


            “This bill nibbles around the edges,” said Camarota. “Will it have that much of an effect? That's the question.”
    


            The proposed changes could have devastating consequences for vulnerable immigrant communities, particularly those who rely on public benefits to survive, said Beatriz Ortiz, a senior staff attorney at the International Rescue Committee. Prior to joining IRC, Ortiz worked at Ayuda, where she represented immigrants as a staff attorney.
    


            “If you don't give people the possibility … the tools, they won't have a dignified life,” Ortiz said.
    


            One of the most consequential changes involves the child tax credit, which House Republicans want to temporarily boost to $2,500 per child, from $2,000. Under the bill, a child's parents would have to have Social Security numbers, in addition to the child.
    


            Currently, families can receive the credit if the parents file their tax returns with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN, which is used by some legal and undocumented immigrants — as long as the child has a Social Security number.
    


            This provision could leave about 2 million children ineligible for the child tax credit, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, which analyzed the bill. The Center for Migration Studies estimates the number is closer to 4.5 million children who are US citizens or lawful permanent residents, otherwise known as green card holders.
    


            “It singles out and disadvantages US citizen children because of their parents' immigration status,” said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noting that research shows the credit has a positive impact on children's health, educational attainment and, eventually, earnings. “That's really alarming.”
    


            Similarly, the “Trump accounts” that the legislation would create would require both parents to have Social Security numbers to be eligible to claim the $1,000 federal contribution for their US-born citizen babies.
    


            Fewer immigrants would be eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the formal name for food stamps, if the House bill becomes law. Refugees, people approved for asylum, domestic violence victims and survivors of labor or sex trafficking would no longer qualify. Only citizens, green card holders, certain Cuban parolees and migrants from certain Pacific Ocean island nations would be able to receive food stamps.
    


            Between 120,000 and 250,000 people would lose access to this food assistance over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Families with citizen children would also feel the pinch – even if the kids would continue to qualify, the household would receive less assistance each month if the parents are no longer eligible.
    


            Gloria, who fled gang violence in El Salvador in 2010 hoping for safety in the US, worries that she could lose a portion of the food stamps that she and her five children, who are citizens, depend on. The family receives a total of $900 a month in benefits.
    


            “I'm about to have a baby; I'm a single mom. If this president decided to take it away, I would be very affected. I live off the SNAP benefits,” said Gloria, who lives in Washington DC and has a T-visa, a protection for trafficking survivors.
    


            Gloria, who asked that CNN not use her full name for fear of retribution, said she was trafficked by her own mother and aunt in Maryland — forced to work at a carpet factory, sleep on the floor and hand over all her wages under threats of deportation from her own family until she finally escaped.
    


            Gloria recently earned her GED, is studying to become a medical assistant and is also learning English. Still, she says she needs continued support to achieve her goals and become fully self-sufficient.
    


            One asylum recipient from Egypt, who asked to be identified only as H.E. so as not to jeopardize his immigration status, told CNN that he depends on food stamps.
    


            “If I lose those benefits, it's going to be bad,” said H.E., who lives in a shelter in Virginia, is unemployed and has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
    


            The package would also block many legal immigrants from receiving Affordable Care Act premium subsidies and Medicare coverage, making it harder for them to obtain health coverage from both the government and private insurers.
    


            Under the bill, asylees, refugees, temporary protected status holders and victims of domestic violence or sex trafficking, among others, would no longer be eligible for Obamacare subsidies or Medicare, even if they worked in the US for the 10-plus years it takes for senior citizens to qualify for the latter program.
    


            One million more people would be uninsured in 2034 if these immigrants lost access to the Affordable Care Act subsidies, according to CBO estimates.
    


            As for Medicaid, which House Republicans have targeted for steep spending cuts, the bill would not alter immigrants' eligibility for the federal program. However, it would levy steep penalties on states that have opted to expand coverage that's similar to Medicaid to a broader array of non-citizens, including undocumented immigrants, using their own funds. Some 14 states plus the District of Columbia cover at least some undocumented residents through these initiatives.
    


            The House bill would cut the share of federal matching funds these states receive for covering low-income adults under Medicaid expansion to 80%, from 90%, which would double states' costs.
    


            How states would react would likely vary, but experts fear that many would have to limit or end their programs covering undocumented residents. The CBO expects this provision would result in 1.4 million more people being uninsured in 2034 – the figure that Johnson often cites, even though these folks are not enrolled in the federal Medicaid program.
    


            The penalty could also hit the states that cover immigrant children and pregnant women with certain legal statuses – including those with temporary protected status and student visas – through a separate state Children's Health Insurance Program. Some 21 states have opted to do so for children and six for pregnant women.
    


            But since the penalty only applies to states that have expanded Medicaid, Pennsylvania and West Virginia would be hit, for instance, but not Florida or Texas, said Leonardo Cuello, research professor for the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. Most states would not be able to afford to continue these optional programs.
    


            “The states are going to have a huge incentive to drop their coverage because the alternative is a massive increase in spending,” he said.

            In the heat of the Jamaican sun, where the wetlands glisten and buzz with life, an ancient predator is vanishing.
    


            There are around 28 species of crocodiles found throughout the world's tropical and subtropical regions. But there is only one species in Jamaica, found primarily along the southern coast from St. Thomas to Westmoreland.
    


            Once revered and feared across the island, the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) has long ruled the mangroves and coastal lagoons.
    


            But in recent years, its population has been decimated, due to illegal hunting, habitat loss and plastic pollution, as well as killings prompted by a lingering fear among locals.
    


            Lawrence Henriques has made it his life's mission to change that.
    


            Known as “The Crocodile Guardian,” Henriques has spent the past four decades fighting for their survival.
    


            He runs the Holland Bay Crocodile Sanctuary, a grassroots conservation project in the southeast of the island, perched on the edge of what he says is one of Jamaica's last viable crocodile habitats.
    


            From this remote corner of the island, he's trying to undo years of damage: nursing sick crocs back to health, raising juveniles and restoring their numbers in the wild.
    


            “There's a real fear of crocodiles in Jamaica,” says Henriques. “They're not tolerated by a lot of people. So if one turns up in someone's backyard, it's often killed for meat or just because people are afraid.”
    


            Although crocodiles are often seen as aggressive and dangerous, attacks are few and far between. While reliable figures are hard to come by, according to the global database CrocAttack, there have been 11 incidents reported over the past decade in Jamaica, including one fatality in 2018.
    


            That's why Henriques is working to change the narrative about the animal and help people understand that they are far less threatening than their reputation suggests.
    


            Born and raised in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, during the 1960s, Henriques always had a penchant for “creepy crawlies,” such as spiders, scorpions and snakes.
    


            But it was crocodiles that truly captured his attention.
    


            “We had a lot more crocodiles and a lot more habitat in those days,” he recalls. “I always had a half a dozen or so baby crocodiles rearing in my bedroom.”
    


            That fascination eventually became a vocation. After studying overseas and learning more about reptiles when working with the Scientific Exploration Society, a UK charity, in Belize, Henriques returned to Jamaica in 1980.  He was startled to find that despite crocodiles being classified as endangered in 1971 under the Wildlife Protection Act, there was little practical conservation happening.



            “The laws were there, but nobody was doing anything,” he says. “The environmental agency was very under-resourced and still is to this day. And there was nobody really with expertise or knowledge on reptiles.”
    


            Henriques volunteered to assist the Jamaican government, carrying out crocodile rescues and providing rehabilitation, all while holding down a job in the citrus industry.
    


            He continued like this for almost 20 years, before a brief relocation to London, UK. When he returned to Jamaica in 2010, he launched what would become the Holland Bay Crocodile Sanctuary — a facility dedicated to rescue, rehabilitation and public education.
    


            The sanctuary, which lies on the edge of a wetland, is home to 27 adult crocodiles along with 18 baby crocs. The juvenile crocs have been bred on site and are typically released into the wild after three years, while the adults have been rescued and rehabilitated after being hit by cars, caught in traps, or found living in squalid conditions. Over the past three years, around 90 have been successfully released back into the wild according to Henriques.
    


            One of the crocodiles living at the sanctuary currently is Xena, who was discovered guarding her eggs in an area littered with trash, her skin slimy and her teeth gray from pollution.
    


            Savannah Boan, an international ambassador from Gatorland Global, the conservation arm of the Florida-based wildlife park which helps to fund the sanctuary, says that since being relocated, Xena's skin has healed and her teeth are white again. Her babies have also been raised at the facility and released into safe areas, helping to boost wild populations of the species.
    


            “Lawrence is doing extraordinary work with very limited resources,” she tells CNN.
    


            Despite legal protections, crocodiles in Jamaica face growing threats. Poaching is rampant, often driven by demand for meat or misguided fear, according to officers from the country's National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA).
    


            “Poaching is definitely a huge problem,” says Leighton Mamdeen, an environmental officer at NEPA. “We try to limit it through enforcement measures such as regular monitoring and we partner with the Jamaica Constabulary Force and the Jamaica Defence Force to do patrols.”



            According to media reports, there is a thriving black market for crocodile meat and eggs in Jamaica, with the meat sold for as much as 5,000 Jamaican dollars ($31) a pound (450 grams) – more than 10 times the price of chicken meat.
    


            This could stem from a widespread misconception in some rural communities that crocodile meat has aphrodisiac properties.
    


            Damany Calder, another environmental officer at NEPA, says he has noticed a troubling pattern during callouts, when crocodiles are discovered with their tails removed.



            “There's a rumour about the crocodile tail… it's (used) either for sexual performance, fertility or longevity,” he says.

            In other cases, crocodiles have been found in backyard ponds, kept as pets, or used as props for TikTok stunts or music videos. There was even a time when a small live crocodile was found stuffed in a broken fridge, says Calder. He believes it may have been part of a ritual referred to as Obeah, a Jamaican religious tradition similar to voodoo.
    


            Social media videos have occasionally resulted in prosecutions but only if culprits are caught in the act, Calder says. Individuals found guilty of killing crocodiles may be charged a maximum fine of $100,000 or face one-year imprisonment.
    


            “The police are heavily involved, and they're trying to improve the penalties,” says Henriques.
    


            “But like everything else, it's catching the person and proving it in court. It's a very long, drawn-out process.”
    


            Development is another killer.
    


            Jamaica's mangroves and wetlands are currently being cleared for tourism and residential development according to The Forestry Department. This affects the country's coastal resilience, as mangroves reduce wave energy and storm surges, helping to prevent flooding, and it damages biodiversity, as they are serve as nurseries for fish and provide essential habitat for species like crocodiles.
    


            As this territory shrinks, crocodiles are forced closer to humans.
    


            “These animals are ending up in places they've always lived,” Henriques says. “But now those places are towns and roads … We've taken their habitat.”

            To Henriques, the crocodile isn't a menace — it's a keystone species that has been on the island for millions of years. It even features on the Jamaican coat of arms, which shows a crocodile perched atop a royal helmet and mantling, designed to symbolize the island's unique wildlife and natural heritage.
    


            “They're like engineers of the ecosystem,” he says. “They dig channels, control fish populations and keep the wetlands healthy.”
    


            He explains that the presence of these apex predators helps to regulate biodiversity within aquatic ecosystems by controlling prey populations and creating microhabitats that support various flora and fauna.



            But Henriques warns that because of poaching and habitat loss, the island no longer has many large male crocodiles left along the coastline: “Most now are smaller. It's a serious shift.”



            “What's happening in Jamaica reflects a global pattern — wetland species are disappearing, and with them, the health of the entire ecosystem,” he adds.
    


            Despite the challenges, there's a cautious sense of hope.
    


            Henriques and NEPA have ramped up community outreach and education programs, especially in areas near crocodile habitats.
    


            “One of the most impactful things we've done is visit schools,” says Mamdeen. “If you start with the kids, you'll have a greater chance of securing the animal's future.”



            When reports of a crocodile in a pool of water near a school caused panic among parents and children, NEPA directed its outreach efforts toward local students.
    


            “We told them: crocodiles would rather run (from you) than rush (towards) you,” he says. “If you're near water at night, walk with a stick. If the animal is touched, it moves.”
    


            Henriques added: “People are beginning to understand these animals have a place … They're not pests. They're survivors.”
    


            Still, the sanctuary is one of only a few conservation efforts on the island, and without continued support, Henriques fears Jamaica's crocodiles may not survive the next few decades.
    


            “We can't afford to lose them,” he says. “They've been here longer than we have. They're part of this land.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said President Donald Trump is “pulling a military dragnet” across Los Angeles during a brief public address on Tuesday. The Democratic governor's remarks come after Trump ordered the deployment of nearly 5,000 troops, including National Guard and Marines, to the nation's second-largest city. They were deployed to protect federal buildings but are now also protecting immigration agents as they carry out arrests.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Calling President Donald Trump a threat to the American way of life, Gov. Gavin Newsom depicted the federal military intervention in Los Angeles as the onset of a much broader effort by Trump to overturn political and cultural norms at the heart of the nation's democracy.

In a speech Tuesday evening, the potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate said the arrival of National Guard and Marine troops in the city at Trump's direction was not simply about quelling protests that followed a series of immigration raids by federal authorities. Instead, he said, it was part of a calculated “war” intended to upend the foundations of society and concentrate power in the White House.

“California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next,” a somber Newsom warned, seated before the U.S. and California flags. “Democracy is next. Democracy is under assault before our eyes. This moment we have feared has arrived.”

As head of the heavily Democratic state known as the epicenter of the so-called Trump resistance, Newsom and the Republican president have long been adversaries. But the governor's speech delivered in prime time argued that Trump was not just a threat to democracy, but was actively working to break down its guardrails that reach back to the nation's founding.

″He's declared a war. A war on culture, on history, on science, on knowledge itself,” Newsom said. “He's delegitimizing news organizations, and he's assaulting the First Amendment.”




Newsom added that Trump is attacking law firms and the judicial branch — “the foundations of an orderly and civil society.”

“It's time for all of us to stand up,” Newsom said, urging any protests to be peaceful. “What Donald Trump wants most is your fealty, your silence, to be complicit in this moment. Do not give in to him.”

His speech came the same day that Newsom asked a court to put an emergency stop to the military helping federal immigration agents, with some guardsmen now standing in protective gauntlet around agents as they carried out arrests. The judge chose not to rule immediately, giving the Trump administration several days to continue those activities before a hearing Thursday. 

Trump has activated more than 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines over the objections of city and state leaders, though the Marines have not yet been spotted in Los Angeles and Guard troops have had limited engagement with protesters. They were originally deployed to protect federal buildings.

Newsom's speech capped several days of acidic exchanges between Trump and Newsom, that included the president appearing to endorse Newsom's arrest if he interfered with federal immigration enforcement. “I think it's great. Gavin likes the publicity, but I think it would be a great thing,” Trump told reporters.

Over the years, Trump has threatened to intercede in California's long-running homeless crisis, vowed to withhold federal wildfire aid as political leverage in a dispute over water rights, called on police to shoot people robbing stores and warned residents that “your children are in danger” because of illegal immigration.

Trump relishes insulting the two-term governor and former San Francisco mayor — frequently referring to him as Gov. “New-scum” — and earlier this year faulted the governor for Southern California's deadly wildfires. 

Trump has argued that the city was in danger of being overrun by violent protesters, while Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass have called the federal intervention an unneeded — and potentially dangerous — overreaction.

The demonstrations have been mostly concentrated in the city's downtown hub. Demonstrations have spread to other cities in the state and nationwide, including Dallas and Austin, Texas, Chicago and New York City, where a thousand people rallied and multiple arrests were made.

Trump left open the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act, which authorizes the president to deploy military forces inside the U.S. to suppress rebellion or domestic violence or to enforce the law in certain situations. It's one of the most extreme emergency powers available to a U.S. president.

“If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We'll see,” he said from the Oval Office.

BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Lawyers for President Donald Trump's administration say he has the authority to abolish national monuments meant to protect historical and archaeological sites across broad landscapes, including two in California created by his predecessor at the request of Native American tribes.

A Justice Department legal opinion released Tuesday disavowed a 1938 determination that monuments created by previous presidents under the Antiquities Act can't be revoked. The department said presidents can cancel monument designations if protections aren't warranted.

The finding comes as the Interior Department under Trump weighs changes to monuments across the nation as part of the administration's push to expand U.S. energy production.

Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Natural Resources Committee, said that at Trump's order, “his Justice Department is attempting to clear a path to erase national monuments.”

Trump in his first term reduced the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante National Monuments in Utah, calling them a “massive land grab.” He also lifted fishing restrictions within a sprawling marine monument off the New England Coast.

Former President Joe Biden reversed the moves and restored the monuments.

The two monuments singled out in the newly released Justice Department opinion were designated by Biden in his final days in office: Chuckwalla National Monument, in Southern California near Joshua Tree National Park, and Sáttítla Highlands National Monument, in Northern California.




The Democrat's declarations for the monuments barred oil and natural gas drilling and mining on the 624,000-acre (2,400-square-kilometer) Chuckwalla site, and the roughly 225,000 acres (800 square kilometers) Sáttítla Highlands site near the California-Oregon border. 

Chuckwalla has natural wonders including the Painted Canyon of Mecca Hills and Alligator Rock, and is home to rare species of plants and animals like the desert bighorn sheep and the Chuckwalla lizard. The Sáttítla Highlands include the ancestral homelands of the Pit River Tribe and Modoc Peoples.

All but three presidents have used the 1906 Antiquities Act to protect unique landscapes and cultural resources. About half the national parks in the U.S. were first designated as monuments. 

But critics of monument designations under Biden and Obama say the protective boundaries were stretched too far, hindering mining for critical minerals.

Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lanora Pettit wrote in the Trump administration opinion that Biden's protections of Chuckwalla and the Sattítla Highlands were part of the Democrat's attempts to create for himself an environmental legacy that includes more places to hike, bike, camp or hunt. 

“Such activities are entirely expected in a park, but they are wholly unrelated to (if not outright incompatible with) the protection of scientific or historical monuments,” Pettit wrote.

Trump in April lifted commercial fishing prohibitions within an expansive marine monument in the Pacific Ocean created under former President Barack Obama.

Environmental groups said Tuesday's Justice Department opinion doesn't give him the authority to shrink monuments at will.

“Americans overwhelmingly support our public lands and oppose seeing them dismantled or destroyed,” said Axie Navas with The Wilderness Society.

Biden established 10 new monuments, among them the site of a 1908 race riot in Springfield, Illinois, and another on a sacred Native American site near the Grand Canyon.

Since 1912, presidents have issued more than a dozen proclamations that diminished monuments, according to a National Park Service database.

Dwight Eisenhower was most active in undoing the proclamations of his predecessors as he diminished six monuments, including Arches in Utah, Great Sand Dunes in Colorado and Glacier Bay in Alaska, which have all since become national parks.

Trump's moves to shrink the Utah monuments in his first term were challenged by environmental groups that said protections for the sites safeguard water supplies and wildlife while preserving cultural sites.

The reductions were reversed by Biden before the case was resolved, and it remains pending. 

President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act after lobbying by educators and scientists who wanted to protect sites from artifact looting and haphazard collecting by individuals. It was the first law in the U.S. to establish legal protections for cultural and natural resources of historic or scientific interest on federal lands.

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) will address Californians at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday as the standoff between the governor and the Trump administration over the Los Angeles riots continues to simmer.

Newsom announced the address Tuesday evening, “in response to President Trump's assault on democracy and the President's illegal militarization of Los Angeles.”

LA RIOTS: WHO ARE THE GROUPS PROTESTING?

The address comes just hours after a federal judge declined to block Trump's deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles.

After protests in the city turned violent against federal immigration officers conducting raids, Trump ordered the National Guard to Los Angeles over the weekend, the first time it was deployed without a governor's consent since 1965. Trump also sent Marines to the city on Monday for additional support.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled the Trump administration's openness on Wednesday to extending President Donald Trump's current 90-day tariff pause beyond July 9 for the United States' top trading partners, as long as they show "good faith" in ongoing trade negotiations.

The U.S. has 18 "important trading partners," Bessent said at a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee in Washington. The Trump administration, he said, is "working toward deals" with those countries.

"It is highly likely," said Bessent, that for those countries and trading blocs, like the European Union, "who are negotiating in good faith," the United States would "roll the date forward to continue good faith negotiations."

"If someone is not negotiating, then we will not," he told the House's tax writing committee.

Until now, Trump administration officials have not suggested that they are open to moving back the 90-day tariff pause without at least "terms of an agreement" before the pause expires.

Bessent's remarks indicate that the Trump administration might be more inclined to shift the self-imposed deadline as it gets closer.

President Donald Trump's 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, announced on April 9, is set to end in less than a month.

Trump officials have repeatedly said that they are close to inking trade deals with half a dozen countries. But so far, the White House has only announced a formal trade agreement with the United Kingdom and a framework agreement with China. 

The U.S.- China deal was announced earlier on Wednesday, but the full details of the agreement were unclear.

In this article

President Donald Trump declared the trade war with China "done" on Wednesday, while his Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said tariffs on Chinese goods will be locked in at the current 55% rate without additional increases. Even if the resolution to the battle with the biggest U.S. foe in Trump's trade war is real, the damage to the supply chain, and U.S. consumer and economy, will remain, say logistics and retail industry executives.

The latest headlines in the trade war come amid a slowdown in orders as the early 2025 period of tariff frontloading ended and firms across the economy prepared for a potential slowdown in the U.S., a fear the CEO of the nation's largest bank, JPMorgan, warned about again on in comments at an industry conference, with Jamie Dimon saying "I think there's a chance real numbers will deteriorate soon,"  at a Morgan Stanley event on Tuesday, before the Trump's administration's most recent comments.

Alan Baer, CEO of logistics firm OL USA, said the existing 55% tariff on Chinese goods will put hundreds, if not thousands, of companies and ultimately jobs at risk. "Very few firms have the pricing power to absorb the tariffs or raise prices to offset the impact," Baer said. "Ultimately, the consumer pays," he added.

White House officials explained to CNBC the 55% tariff mentioned in President Trump's social media post is the stacking of the Chinese tariffs. This is the minimum rate being paid by US shippers. US importers tell CNBC the rate is still way too high to resume full orders.

"A 55% tariff from China will substantially cause instability for consumer goods companies that are bringing goods in from China," said Bruce Kaminstein, a member of NY Angels and founder and former CEO of cleaning products company Casabella. "President Trump recently said he doesn't want to make t-shirts? Why is he doing this then? Does he want to make spatulas? I don't think so," he added.

The latest national inflation data released on Wednesday showed a smaller than expected increase in prices, though it is expected to remain volatile with tariffs policy uncertainty remaining.

Kaminstein said with most companies working on a 40-60% percent gross margin, this will cause either substantial price increases or substantial cutting of expenses to survive, adding stress to the cash flow of these companies.

"A reported 55% tariff on our largest supplier of American apparel and footwear, stacked on top of already high MFN and Section 301 rates is not a win for America," said Steve Lamar, CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. "We're closely watching for more details, but the reality is this: nearly all clothes and shoes sold in the U.S. are now subject to elevated tariff rates. These costs will hit American families hard, especially as they get ready for back-to-school shopping and the holiday season. New trade deals that bring lower tariffs can't come soon enough."

The Chinese government has not confirmed the Trump statements beyond saying on Tuesday it had agreed to the "Geneva consensus" trade terms worked out earlier this year with the U.S. Trump said in a social media post on Wednesday about the deal that it is "subject to final approval" between himself and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The tariff uncertainty is also weighing on EU exports bound for the U.S. On Wednesday, Lutnick said an EU trade deal would likely come last, partially due to the need to deal with a bloc of countries rather than a single government.

The current situation leaves freight carriers focused on U.S.-EU trade concerned.

Andrew Abbott, CEO of Atlantic Container Lines, a niche ocean carrier on the Europe/US trade lane, told CNBC the pace of exports and imports has been good, but he is worried a major correction is coming because of the tariff uncertainty and lingering fears of a recession.

"The transatlantic trade has seen an increase in cargo volume in both directions during the last month, averaging 15% compared to last year" said Abbott. "An increasing number of our U.S. import customers are expressing fears of reduced sales because of a potential U.S. recession in the second half, so this is weighing heavy on people's minds," he added.

As a result, Abbott said many companies are choosing the "wait and see" strategy ahead of any deal being made.

The trade headlines and concerns come ahead of an expected increase in orders in July and August, peak season for when containers are scheduled to arrive for the holiday shopping season. But logistics experts say there will be no Covid-level surges at U.S. ports.

"Companies pulled in freight to get out of the tariff crosshairs in March, April, and May," said Dean Croke, DAT Freight & Analytics principal analyst. "Warehouse distribution surged at that time. We are essentially in peak season now," he added.

The first customers to take advantage of the tariff pause window were those with time-sensitive cargo, like medical supplies and high-value cargo, like automotive parts, luxury furniture, and fashion, according to Mike Short, president of global forwarding for CH Robinson.

Noah Hoffman, vice president for retail logistics for C.H. Robinson, told CNBC that when he was visiting one of its biggest retail customers last week, "I was only sort of surprised to see jack-o'-lantern dinner plates in their distribution center already."

"We're four months out and already moving Halloween items to be ready for store delivery the next day. We're seeing the same thing in our retail consolidation centers, where we're pulling in seasonal and holiday freight from multiple retail suppliers. This is a combination of carryover inventory from last year and freight front-loaded in Q1 to avoid the higher tariffs that were coming in April," Hoffman said. 

After the U.S. agreed to a pause in the trade war with China, plans were made for shipping that will result in "a busy four-week period this summer," Croke said. But he added, "trucking carriers are worried about the rest of the year. The second quarter is normally an important setup quarter for the rest of the year, which drives rates up. This means as of now, they are worried they will play catch-up for the rest of the year."

In the current tariff pause window, there is still time to bring merchandise in from China before the 90-day window closes in mid-August, Hoffman said. "Domestically, we might be moving some of that freight in late June and into July. So, shoppers may have fewer back-to-school items to choose from, but at this point, glow-in-the-dark skeletons and fake vampire teeth will probably make it," he added.

The trucking industry, in particular, is facing a variety of challenges. While imports contribute approximately 10% of trucking demand, domestic manufacturing is traditionally the main driver, but demand is down. Produce season, another industry driver, is adding to headwinds due to colder spring temperatures in California and decreased consumer demand.

"I think the damage is done this year," Croke said. "Carriers will struggle to recover this year. The supply chain will not recover until these trade deals are done. When you lose trust, how do you make business decisions when it can be undone in a tweet? You have to expect the worst-case scenario, and anything better than that is an upside. I don't see how the market recovers," he added.

The trickle-down impact of the lower freight volumes can be seen in intermodal volume, down 7.42% year over year, and truckload volume, down 13.37% year over year. Both the rail and trucking industries make their profits in moving containers.

The Ocean TEU Index, which represents the volume of ocean container bookings, shows 2025 is trailing 2024 slightly year-over-year. Historically, cargo volume has been an early U.S. consumer demand prediction tool.

The National Retail Federation's forecast, based on orders and container analysis for June through October's holiday shipping season, is down 14% year over year. Jon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation, said once a deal is signed, the tariff rate on China will be critical for business decisions.

"We look forward to getting more information from the administration. However, agreeing to a 55% tariff that maintains the current IEEPA, fentanyl, and Section 301 tariffs is still extremely high, particularly for small businesses that continue to struggle with the current tariffs," said Gold.

Manufacturing out of Asia fell to a 17-month low, according to the latest GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index, a leading indicator tracking demand conditions, shortages, transportation costs, inventories, and backlogs, based on a monthly survey of 27,000 businesses.

Another leading indicator warning of a decrease in manufacturing orders and leaner holiday inventories is empty ocean freight containers.

In ITS Logistics' June U.S. Port/Rail Ramp Freight Index, empty container return issues persisted at the nation's busiest ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, "Empty container buildup continues despite higher outbound empties; congestion challenges remain," the report stated.

CH Robinson expected softer conditions to persist at the Port of LA and Long Beach, with volume to rise month-over-month in early June, but remain lower than this time last year.

According to North American port data analysis from ITS Logistics, the terminals which process the containers at ports nationally are running at 60-75% capacity.

The U.S. export market will also continue to experience challenging conditions due to limited vessels after a pullback in sailings by ocean freight companies.

At the Port of New York, a surplus of empty containers is a result of New York port terminals restricting returns and limiting some export bookings to free up vessel space and improve flow. "Ongoing blank sailings have hindered carriers' ability to reposition equipment efficiently. With limited vessel calls and mounting backlogs, this imbalance is expected to persist in the weeks ahead," C.H. Robinson reported.

At Gulf Coast ports, tariff-related demand shifts and blank sailings significantly reduced the volume of incoming containers. "As a result, exporters should expect tightening container availability, particularly at inland rail ramps and U.S. Gulf Coast ports such as Houston, starting in July or August," C.H. Robinson reported.

During Covid, the transport of empty containers back to China took precedence over U.S. exports. Manufacturers in China and Asia needed those containers so they could fill them with products quickly to keep up with the tremendous U.S. consumer demand.

"With the significant reduction in vessels calling LA/LB due to the tariff activity, we are seeing significant increases in empty container dwell outside of the terminals," said Paul Brashier, vice president of global supply chain at ITS Logistics. "It is getting very difficult to find locations to terminate empties and in addition many ocean carriers are implementing laborious termination policies not seem since the post- Covid era."

The UK tariff pause resulted in the restoration of more "normal" volume in that market, Abbott said, and the fear of an EU tariff pause ending in July fueled the increased EU shipments as manufacturers stocked shelves a bit more in case a UK-type deal for the EU, and deal on steel and aluminum tariffs, are not agreed to in a way that favors greater trade.

But the ongoing uncertainty can be seen in the exports of the top countries to the U.S.

Departed container volumes (twenty-foot equivalent units) show Italy is down 15% year over year. China is down 11% year over year, while South Korea is down 9%. Vietnam and India, both beneficiaries of the China-plus-one supply chain strategy, are up 21% and 13%, respectively.

Factoring in the travel time and the trade pause deadlines, U.S. importers only have one more week to place ocean freight orders from the EU to have their products arrive in the U.S. before the tariff pause deadline.

Orders from China need to be placed by the end of June to beat out the existing tariff pause deadline.

Last Friday's jobs report was upbeat, but the numbers might not be telling the whole story, one economist warns.

Samuel Tombs, Chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, sees a labor market struggling with softening hiring and an accelerating trend of downward revisions.

In May, 139,000 jobs were added, beating the 125,000 consensus estimate, but that was overshadowed somewhat by sharp revisions to prior months' data. March's initial figure of 224,000 payrolls added has since been nearly slashed in half, down to 120,000.

It's likely that May's figure is inflated, too, Tombs said.

"We expect May's number to be revised down to about 100,000 by the third estimate, published in early August," Tombs wrote in a recent note.

Since January 2023, downward revisions between the intial and third estimates for each month have averaged 30,000.

The frequency of downward revisions could be due to reporting by small businesses filing payroll data late, Tombs said. Smaller companies are often hit the hardest by high interest rates and tariff costs.

"Small businesses are really the canary in the coal mine in this downturn," Tombs told BI. "They don't have the financial capacity to deal with many of the upfront costs that are involved with tariffs. They still face very high borrowing costs, so they are very, very cautious with both their hiring and capex decisions going forward."

Tombs sees continued weakness in the retail, wholesale, and transport and logistics sectors, and expects employment in those parts of the economy to fall by 50,000 by year-end due to a reduction in the "pull-forward effect" from tariffs, which saw many businesses and consumers rush to spend money ahead of tariff-related price hikes.

On top of the revisions, hiring also appeared poised to slow. The NFIB small business hiring intentions index slipped to its lowest level since May 2020, and regional Fed surveys suggest continued declines in service-sector employment outside healthcare and education.

"Of all the indicators that we track, it is the best singular indicator of payroll growth that we've found in the last three years," Tombs said of the NFIB survey.

In the chart below, hiring intentions tracked by regional Fed surveys are weaker than the 2015 to 2024 average. Actual job growth in the private services sector tends to move closely with hiring intentions, meaning that when hiring intentions fall, actual hiring tends to drop shortly after.

Tombs believes government jobs will also continue to decline after their DOGE gutting as federal employees who accepted a voluntary buyout get removed from the payroll in September — they've fallen by 59,000 this year, including by 22,000 in May.

On this trajectory, Tombs expects the unemployment rate to peak at 4.8% by December.

This year, the Fed has been in wait-and-see mode when it comes to cutting rates, and some strategists believe it's prioritizing bringing inflation down before turning to expansionary monetary policy. But these factors point to a labor market that's weaker than it seems, and Tombs believes the Fed will need to start cutting rates in September to provide relief for businesses, before inflation peaks.

Apple is opening up about why your iPhone doesn't have a more personalized AI-powered Siri yet.

It's a relatively rare example of the company speaking at greater length about a bruising setback months after it first issued a statement saying its development was taking "longer than we thought" and the AI feature would be delayed.

The saga began a year ago at Apple's WWDC 2024 conference, where it introduced with much fanfare an overhauled version of Siri with new AI features. 

Now, a year later, it's still M.I.A. and Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, Craig Federighi, is speaking somewhat candidly in various interviews at this year's WWDC event about what went wrong.

The short answer: Apple wants to get it right.

"When you have an experience like asking Siri to do something, either it becomes something you can depend on reliably or it's something, in the end, you're just not going to use," Federighi told YouTuber iJustine.

With that in mind, Apple wasn't "able to take the approach we were taking to the quality level in the time frame that initially we thought we could," he continued.

However, work continues on building a more capable Siri that can remember the name of a guy you had lunch with months prior, the kind of situation shown off in a now-deleted ad from last year with "The Last of Us" actor Bella Ramsey. That version of Siri — Federighi called it V1 — was intended to arrive in December 2024 or spring 2025, he told TechRadar.

"Version one we had working here at the time that we were getting close to the conference, and had, at the time, high confidence that we could deliver it," Federighi told the publication.

When the company realized that version wouldn't "meet our customer expectations or Apple standards" on the timeline it had planned, it pivoted to focusing on V2 and officially announced the delay in March, according to the Apple exec. Federighi described V2 as "a deeper end-to-end architecture that we knew was ultimately what we wanted to create, to get to a full set of capabilities that we wanted for Siri."

Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider.

"We have, you know, the V2 architecture, of course, working in-house, but we're not yet to the point where it's delivering at the quality level that I think makes it a great Apple feature, and so we're not announcing the date for when that's happening," Federighi told TechRadar.

Disney and Universal joined forces in a lawsuit against artificial intelligence image creator Midjourney, alleging copyright infringement.

It is the first AI copyright lawsuit from Hollywood giants.

The lawsuit claims that the company used and distributed AI-generated characters from the movie studios like Star Wars, The Simpsons and other films and alleges that Midjourney disregarded requests to stop.

The studios included numerous examples in the suit of AI-generated images of characters from Cars, Toy Story, Shrek, The Avengers and the minions from Despicable Me.

Disney and Universal are demanding a jury trial, arguing that the actions threaten to "upend the bedrock incentives of U.S. copyright law."

"Midjourney is the quintessential copyright free-rider and a bottomless pit of plagiarism," the movie studios said, calling the actions "calculated and willful."

Both companies said they sent letters to Midjourney's counsel to prevent further copyright infringement, but the company continued to release new iterations of its image generator. 

"​​Midjourney, which has attracted millions of subscribers and made $300 million last year alone, is focused on its own bottom line and ignored Plaintiffs' demands," the suit says.

CNBC has reached out to Midjourney for comment on the case.

The rise of AI has raised the stakes in the media industry, and sparked concerns over how to protect content from illegal copyrighting. This is one of the most significant copyright legal battles to date involving AI.

"Creativity is the cornerstone of our business," said Kimberley Harris, executive vice president and general counsel of NBCUniversal, in a statement. "We are bringing this action today to protect the hard work of all the artists whose work entertains and inspires us and the significant investment we make in our content." 

Midjourney told Disney it was reviewing the letter but never responded, according to the suit. Universal said Midjourney did not respond to its letter.

"We are bullish on the promise of AI technology and optimistic about how it can be used responsibly as a tool to further human creativity," said Horacio Gutierrez, senior executive vice president and chief legal and compliance officer of The Walt Disney Company, in a statement. "But piracy is piracy, and the fact that it's done by an AI company does not make it any less infringing."

The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court Central District of California.

The entire Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board resigned over what it said Wednesday was meddling by the Trump administration in the board's authority to award scholarships.

The 12-member board, in a statement, said the State Department, which runs the scholarship program, had denied Fulbright awards "to a substantial number of individuals who were selected for the 2025-2026 academic year." 

"The administration is also currently subjecting an additional 1,200 foreign Fulbright recipients to an unauthorized review process and could reject more," the board said in its statement, which was posted on Substack.

"We believe these actions not only contradict the statute but are antithetical to the Fulbright mission and the values, including free speech and academic freedom, that Congress specified in the statute," the board said.

Jed Katz, the chair of the board and managing director of Javelin Venture Partners, , referred CNBC to the statement when asked about his and the other members' resignations.

Like every other member of the board, Katz was appointed to the panel by former President Joe Biden.

The other board members who resign include people who served in Biden's administration, among them Mala Adiga, who was a deputy assistant to Biden, former White House deputy chief of staff Jen O'Malley Dillon, who chaired Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign, and former Biden speechwriter Vinay Reddy.

CNBC has requested comment from the State Department.

The resignations were first reported by The New York Times.

"Effective immediately, members of the Congressionally mandated Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board voted overwhelmingly to resign from the board, rather than endorse unprecedented actions that we believe are impermissible under the law, compromise U.S. national interests and integrity, and undermine the mission and mandates Congress established for the Fulbright program nearly 80 years ago," the board said in its statement.

"At the program's inception, Congress clearly specified that the Fulbright Board has final approval authority of applicants, which occurs after an exhaustive and deliberate, year-long process led by non-partisan career staff at the State Department and Embassies around the world," the board said.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Wednesday that U.S. tariff levels on Chinese imports will not change from their current levels, even as a trade deal between Washington and Beijing has yet to be finalized.

Asked on CNBC's "Money Movers" if the current U.S. tariffs on China are not going to change again, Lutnick replied, "You can definitely say that."

President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post Wednesday morning that U.S. duties on China will total 55% — but a White House official told CNBC soon after that that figure is not new.

Rather, it comprises the existing 30% blanket U.S. tariffs on China, plus the 25% tariffs on specific products that also were already in place, the official said.

Trump sent his all-caps post hours after Lutnick and other trade negotiators for the two economic superpowers concluded high-level talks in London.

The president said the deal is "done," but added that it is still "subject to final approval" between himself and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Trump said China's tariffs on the U.S. will stay at 10%, where they have stood since both sides agreed last month to temporarily pare back retaliatory duties on each others' goods.

That 90-day reprieve came after initial talks in Geneva, Switzerland, that yielded a tentative de-escalation on tariffs but left other key sticking points unclear.

Trump in Wednesday's post also wrote that "full magnets, and any necessary rare earths, will be supplied, up front, by China" as a result of the London talks.

In a follow-up, he wrote, "President XI and I are going to work closely together to open up China to American Trade."

Lutnick said on CNBC that the takeaway from this week's negotiations was that "they set up the Geneva truce."

Beijing was "slow-rolling" its export of rare earths, prompting retaliation from Washington — including a crackdown on visas for Chinese students at U.S. universities, Lutnick said.

"We were at mutual assured annoyance," the secretary said. But Trump's one-on-one phone call with Xi last week "changed everything," Lutnick said.

"They are going to approve all applications for magnets from United States companies right away," he said.

But Lutnick's optimism papered over unanswered questions that importers have about China's promises.

For example, China has agreed to issue only temporary, six-month licenses to U.S. companies seeking to import rare-earth minerals and magnets from China, The Wall Street Journal reported.

This would allow Beijing to revisit its decision to issue any given license every six months, creating uncertainty in the supply chain for U.S. companies.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Lutnick's remarks, or for additional details on the London agreement terms.

Central banks' growing appetite for gold meant that the precious metal was the second-largest global reserve asset in 2024, according to a European Central Bank report out Wednesday — but analysts suggest some institutions may be nearing their fill.

Central banks' gold stockpiles are close to levels last seen in the 1960s. Combined with gold's soaring price, it is now second only to the U.S. dollar as their biggest reserve holding in value terms, the ECB said in its analysis Wednesday.

In 2023, gold and the euro were roughly level at around 16.5% as a share of global official reserves on average, a CNBC calculation of ECB data showed. In 2024, that shifted to 16% for the euro and 19% for gold — with the U.S. dollar accounting for 47%.

Central banks amass liquid assets such as foreign currencies and gold as a hedge against inflation and to diversify their holdings. It also allows them to sell these reserves to support their own currency in times of stress. Gold is seen providing long-term value and resilience through volatility, and central banks now account for more than 20% of its global demand, up from around a tenth in the 2010s.

The ECB said survey data had found gold was increasingly attractive to emerging and developing countries that were concerned about sanctions and the potential erosion of the role of major currencies in the international monetary system.

Gold prices have set a string of fresh record highs over the last few years, including in 2025. A stunning rally has turned to choppiness in recent months, as global markets have been rattled by fast-changing U.S. tariff policy.

A turning point for the precious metal came around the time of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which combined with spiking inflation and expectations of rising interest rates, spurring a flight to so-called safe haven assets. Geopolitical and economic uncertainty has remained elevated consistently since then.

China has been a leading driver of the gold rally, with India and Turkey among its other major buyers.

Many of the tailwinds that have propelled gold still remain. 

"Investors should ensure portfolio diversification and hold sufficient exposure to gold and hedge funds" with further turbulence in stocks expected, Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, advised clients in a note last week.

But there are signs that central bank purchases may cool in the months ahead.

The institutions "have played a key role in the gold rally and will probably continue buying gold, albeit at a slower pace than in the past couple of years," Hamad Hussain, climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics, told CNBC.

"Indeed, the perception of gold as hedge against global fiscal, inflationary, and geopolitical risks supports the case for central bank reserve managers to allocate a greater share of their portfolio to gold. Recent doubts over the dollar's safe-haven status could also boost the attractiveness of both gold and the euro as reserve assets over the coming years," Hussain added.

The rate of central bank gold purchases fell 33% quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of the year, according to data from the World Gold Council analysed by bank ING, while Chinese purchases notably slowed.

"Given the strong run in gold prices, the momentum in gold buying could slow. But on a long-term basis, the uncertain geopolitical backdrop and desire for diversification will support the accumulation of gold as reserves," Janet Mui, CFA, head of market analysis at RBC Brewin Dolphin, told CNBC.

"As the U.S. wants to take a more isolationist approach in trade, it makes sense for central banks of its key trading partners to diversify their reserves away from the U.S. dollar."

Though central bank demand has risen, the majority of gold demand — 70% — comes from jewellery and investment, the ECB figures showed. 

According to the ECB's own report, the impact of geopolitics and demand on gold prices going forward will "depend on the stickiness of gold supply."

"It has been argued that gold supply has responded elastically to increases in demand in past decades, including through strong growth in above-ground stocks," it said.

"Therefore, if history is any guide, further increases in the official demand for gold reserves may also support further growth in global gold supply."

The impacts of the pandemic-era government spending and monetary policy that helped support the U.S. economy have faded, and that makes the country vulnerable to a downturn in the coming months, according to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.

"I think there's a chance real numbers will deteriorate soon," Dimon said at a Morgan Stanley conference on Tuesday, according to a transcript from FactSet.

The U.S. has continued to see growth in total employment and consumer spending this year, even as survey data has shown weakening confidence in consumers and business leaders in the face of the Trump administration's tariff policies.

Dimon downplayed the survey data, saying that "neither consumers nor businesses ever pick the inflection points," but said the economy's "soft landing" was likely to look weaker going forward.

"Employment will come down a little bit. Inflation will go up a little bit. Hopefully, it's just a little bit," he said, adding that lower levels of immigration is another complicating for the factor.

Dimon, who has been CEO of JPMorgan since 2006, has a history of sharing cautious or negative outlooks on the economy. His comments on Tuesday were not unusually pessimistic.

The most recent economic data shows both job growth and inflation slowed in May.

Another area that Dimon warned about was private credit, which has become a booming business on Wall Street and is seen as a potential area of concern in the event of a recession. The CEO explained that the risks of private credit are different for banks — which line up the deals and then move them off their books — and for investors who are looking for long-term returns from the asset class.

"Do I think that now is a good time to buy credit if I was a fund manager? No. I wouldn't be buying credit today at these prices and these spreads," Dimon said.

FEMA recently told Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri and Oklahoma it won't be granting funds to bolster state defenses against future natural disasters.

The Trump administration is increasingly skipping a form of federal disaster aid that helps states better prepare for future storms, flooding and wildfires. 

The Federal Emergency Management Agency rejected requests for such resiliency money, known as Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funding, for Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri and Oklahoma last week, part of a trend that started this spring.

In this article

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is growing more bullish about quantum computing — and he expects they'll start solving real-world problems in the coming years.

"Quantum computing is reaching an inflection point," Jensen declared during his keynote speech at Nvidia's GTC Paris developer conference Wednesday.

Quantum computers are machines that use the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers, which store information in bits (ones and zeroes).

Quantum computers use quantum bits, or "qubits," which can be zero, one or something in between — the aim being to process much larger volumes of data to facilitate breakthroughs in areas like medicine, science and finance.

Quantum has been a buzzy space for investors with the rise of several popular stocks, such as Rigetti Computing and IonQ, which on Monday acquired Oxford Ionics for $1.1 billion. Shares of Rigetti and IonQ were up 4.5% and 3.7% respectively in U.S. premarket trading.

Huang on Wednesday said he's been impressed with the "large community" of quantum computing companies within Europe, adding that he'd met with representatives of French quantum startup Pasqal on Tuesday night.

"We are within reach" of being able to apply quantum computers "in areas that can solve some interesting problems in the coming years," Huang added, as he talked up Nvidia's own hybrid quantum-classical computing solution, Cuda Q. "This is a really exciting time."

This marks a more bullish view from the Nvidia boss on quantum, after Huang previously said he thinks a 15-year timeline for realizing useful quantum computers is "on the early side," and that a 20-year timeframe was a likelier target.

His views at the time led to quantum computing stocks including Rigetti, IonQ and D-Wave Quantum plunging. More recently, Huang has admitted his comments came out wrong and expressed his surprise about the ensuing market movements.

Huang isn't alone in spotting the quantum computing hype. Late last year, Google announced its latest quantum chip, Willow, which it said marked a major breakthrough in so-called "error correction" — a set of techniques used to protect quantum information from errors.

Surviving the gruelling hours and high demands of a job in consulting isn't easy.

Deloitte has a new solution to help its employees handle the stress: Lego.

The Big Four professional services firm has updated its long-running well-being subsidy program to include "Legos and puzzles" on a list of items that Deloitte will reimburse, internal policy documents seen by Business Insider show.

The firm has long offered eligible US staff an annual subsidy to spend on one or a combination of subscriptions, equipment, and experiences. In 2021, the firm doubled the allowance from $500 to $1,000, an internal webpage shows.

The subsidy is meant to "empower and support your journey toward thriving mentally, physically, and financially and living your purpose," the policy documents say.

Most partners and salaried workers are offered the benefit. Interns, contracted professionals, and employees on a leave of absence are not eligible.

One Deloitte US employee told BI that people were discussing the new updates in internal team chats.

"Most of the responses are things like 'Lego?!?!? Finally!' or jokes about how they can now rationalize buying the coveted Millennium Falcon Star Wars Lego set," the employee said.

Lego's most expensive set, the Star Wars Ultimate Collector Series Millennium Falcon, costs $850, leaving Deloitte workers with a small allowance left over to spend on other qualifying items like fencing classes or neck pillows.

A second Deloitte employee told BI that they see the subsidy as a nod of appreciation from the company for dealing with the stress and frustrations of their job.

"This makes a huge difference! I personally like to think of what I need/want for the next subsidy. I have been able to upgrade my workspace, and it helps with the work intake," the person said.

They added that Lego was receiving a lot of attention in the office, as it was a departure from the basics. "Knocking out a four-hour Lego build in under two hours is a great stress reliever," the employee said.

Lego is just one of several new additions to the list of approved items, which were updated on June 1, the start of Deloitte's financial year.

Under a section titled "what's new for FY26" are kitchenware and kitchen appliances (e.g., blender, refrigerator), spa services like facials and body treatments, personal portable cooling fans, and ergonomic, cooling, and sleeping pillows.

Employees can also spend the subsidy on items like office furniture, gym equipment, financial support apps, fitness classes, and gaming consoles, including the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation.

Deloitte US did not respond to a request for comment from BI.

Not all are as positive about the subsidy program, with one Deloitte US employee telling BI they think it is only given "because of how much this job sucks."

The US division of Deloitte has faced a challenging period after its contracts with the government came under scrutiny as part of the White House Office's efforts to cut federal spending.

By April, at least 127 of the firm's government contracts had been cut or modified, according to BI's analysis of data on the DOGE website.

That month, Deloitte Consulting CEO Jason Salzetti said in an internal meeting that a "small percentage" of workers in the firm's government division would be laid off. Employees told BI that DOGE's actions had shifted the climate at Deloitte.

The US branch of Deloitte had 172,800 employees in 2024, when it last reported head count.

German start-up Proxima Fusion on Wednesday announced it had raised 130 million euros ($148 million) in a record funding round, with investors hopeful the company can soon develop the world's first commercial nuclear fusion power plant.

The Series A financing round, which was co-led by investors Cherry Ventures and Balderton Capital, represents the largest private fusion investment round in Europe to date.

The buzz around nuclear fusion has kicked into overdrive in recent years. Advocates say the technology, which is the process that powers the sun and stars, can play a pivotal role in the energy transition.

Fusion energy is the process of jamming together two hydrogen atoms to form one helium atom, which releases massive amounts of power. Scientists and engineers have been scrambling to recreate and harness nuclear fusion since the theory was first understood in the 1930s.

"The single thing maybe that is worth highlighting is the speed at which this is happening," Proxima Fusion CEO and co-founder Francesco Sciortino told CNBC by video call.

"It is a bit uncommon in the domain of deep tech and especially in Europe, of course, but $150 million gives us the financing that we need for everything that we have ahead of us in the next few years," he added.

Proxima Fusion's chief executive described nuclear fusion as the "ultimate" source of clean energy and something that is "inevitable" for humanity.

"The question is not whether fusion is possible but whether we manage to harness it on Earth in a way that lends itself to commercial efforts," Sciortino said.

If nuclear fusion can be replicated at an industrial scale, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says the technology could provide virtually limitless clean, safe and affordable energy that meets the world's demand.

Not everyone is convinced, however. Researchers have suggested the technology is likely still a long way off from being ready to be scaled up for commercial use.

The Series A financing round brings Proxima Fusion's total funding to more than 185 million euros in private and public capital, accelerating the Munich-based firm's mission of building the first stellarator-based fusion power plant in the 2030s.

An alternative to the more common tokamak, a stellarator is a device that uses magnetic fields to confine plasma in the shape of a donut, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. These magnetic fields allow scientists to control the plasma particles and allow the right conditions for nuclear fusion.

"Stellarators aren't just the most technologically viable approach to fusion energy—they're the power plants of the future, capable of leading Europe into a new era of clean energy," Daniel Waterhouse, partner at Balderton Capital, said in a statement.

Proxima Fusion was founded two years ago as a spin out from the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP).

Tech billionaire Elon Musk on Wednesday said he regretted some of the social media posts he made about U.S. President Donald Trump last week during an explosive public dispute with his former close ally.

"I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far," Musk said on the X social media platform.

The feud dissolved a tight partnership that had propelled Musk to spearhead the budget-slashing Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, under Trump's second administration, fueling market concerns over the outlook for the tech tycoon's Tesla and SpaceX businesses. Immediately after the row, the electric vehicle automaker saw its biggest ever hit, with shares since recouping losses.

Last week's conflict was sparked by Musk's opposition to the Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" tax and spending bill. In a CBS interview, Musk said the package "undermines" the work of DOGE, further blasting it on social media by saying it would substantially increase the U.S. budget deficit. The Trump administration has disputed this point.

Over the weekend, Trump said there would be consequences for Musk if he supported Democratic candidates challenging the tax and spending bill. At the time, the president noted that he had no plans for speaking with Musk — before changing tack on Monday to indicate he would not have a problem if Musk called.

The row, carried out simultaneously over the X and Truth Social media platforms owned by Musk and Trump, respectively, posed immediate threats to the tech billionaire's ventures.

Critically, the U.S. president suggested terminating government contracts and subsidies awarded to Musk's companies. Musk meanwhile threatened to decommission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft — which is currently the only U.S. choice for bringing crew to and from the International Space Station — before quickly walking back his statement.

The storm showed signs of settling by the weekend. As of Saturday, Musk appeared to have deleted some of his social media posts that had contributed to the ramped-up conflict with the White House leader, including an update in which he had accused Trump of being mentioned in the "files" of late sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein. The White House had disputed the allegation.

A post in which Musk replied "yes" to a social media user calling for Trump to be impeached and replaced with Vice President JD Vance also appeared to have been deleted.

In turn, Trump on Monday said he was planning to retain the Starlink technology, a satellite internet service that is part of Musk's SpaceX, at the White House.

Nintendo sold more than 3.5 million units of its flagship Switch 2 gaming system in the four days following its launch, with online stores of major U.S. retailers putting up "out of stock" signs. 

The record-breaking start for the company's first new console in eight years, puts Nintendo on the path to realizing its aim of selling 15 million units of the Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026. 

However, analysts continue to believe that those expectations are modest, and forecast the strong initial demand to sustain.

"The market expected a record from Nintendo, and as it turns out, Nintendo delivered," Serkan Toto, CEO and founder of gaming industry consultancy Kantan Games, told CNBC.

"All signals prior to launch pointed to significant demand, and I believe we will see further records broken over the next weeks or months," he added.

Toto has maintains that the Switch 2 will sell over 20 million units in its first 12 months. David Gibson, senior research analyst at MST Financial told CNBC that he expects 20 million sales for the year ending March 2026.

The Switch 2, which was released on June 5, has been met with much fanfare, with people lining up for hours ahead of midnight releases at Nintendo stores.

"Fans around the world are showing their enthusiasm for Nintendo Switch 2 as an upgraded way to play at home and on the go," Nintendo of America President and Chief Operating Officer Doug Bowser said in a statement, adding the company was thankful for the response. 

Tokyo-listed shares of Nintendo, which have gained nearly 30% so far this year, were down 3.5% on Wednesday, LSEG data showed. The company has seen its shares rise nearly fivefold since the original Switch debuted in early March 2017.

It remains to be seen if the Switch 2 can recapture the magic of its predecessor, which had set the bar with 15 million unit sales in its first year. It went on to sell more than 152 million units to become the second-highest selling Nintendo device ever, behind the Nintendo DS.

The record initial sales of the Switch are in line with the strong demand analysts had predicted. However, the rush has put into question Nintendo's ability to meet demand. 

Retailers including Walmart, GameStop, Target and Best Buy were out of stock of the consoles, their online stores showed Wednesday. 

In April, Nintendo's Bowser told CNBC that the company had been working with "retail partners to ensure there's ample supply for not only the launch weekend, but well beyond."

However, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa stated the same month that 2.2 million people in Japan had entered the lottery to purchase the Switch 2 on launch day, exceeding expectations and what the company had initially planned to deliver to stores.

Kantan Games' Toto said shortages in Japan were expected to persist, but would be less impactful elsewhere.

"Except for Japan where demand for Switch 2 is extraordinarily high, it looks like fans who really want the console and invest time in trying to secure one actually can get one," he said. "It might take a while, but as far as can be monitored, supply seems to be more robust than around the launch of the original Switch in 2017."

President Donald Trump's "reciprocal tariffs" on most countries around the world also present headwinds for the Switch 2. 

In April, the company announced that it would delay preorders of the Switch 2 in the U.S. while it considers the impact of tariffs.

The Switch 2 retails for $449 in the U.S., which makes it Nintendo's priciest console to date.

Nintendo's Bowser said in April the company was going to "monitor where tariffs are going" before making any further decisions on price hikes. 

MST Financial's Gibson said that a resolution to Trump's tariffs and lower duty rates could see the Switch 2 prices drop in the U.S.

The Switch 2 builds on the success of the original Switch, featuring a larger screen and improved performance. The system also introduces the new GameChat2 feature, which allows players to voice or video chat with friends online and share game screens.

 Strategy—the freshly rebranded MicroStrategy (MSTR)—has shifted from being an enterprise software firm that sells business-intelligence (BI) tools to the world's largest corporate owner of bitcoin. It holds about 581,000 bitcoins, worth around $63 billion, which is significantly higher than its annual software revenue of about $463 million. (All data here and below are as of early June 2025.)


 Founder and CEO Michael Saylor calls the company a “Bitcoin Treasury Company,” a moniker the early 2025 name change makes explicit. To fund this hoard, Strategy has issued waves of zero-coupon convertible notes and new equity, turning itself into a leveraged bet on "digital gold."


 Michael Saylor co-founded MicroStrategy in 1989. Through the 1990s the firm landed data-mining deals with McDonald's and others, and went public in 1998, briefly making Saylor a paper billionaire during the dot-com boom. After nearly going bankrupt because of a 2000 accounting scandal that resulted in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission settlement, the company steadily pivoted toward cloud analytics.


 Fast-forward to August 2020, when Saylor first deployed some $250 million of idle cash into bitcoin, citing cash-debasement fears.


 Multiple follow-on buys—financed first with cash, then with debt—turned the firm into “Wall Street's bitcoin proxy.” The company's metamorphosis was completed with Strategy's name change, complete with an orange palette inspired by bitcoin.


 Saylor champions his “infinite money glitch,” arguing that borrowing cheaply against stock to buy scarcer bitcoin offers shareholders leveraged digital gold exposure. Other high-profile companies are looking to follow Strategy's Bitcoin treasury playbook, with both Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) and GameStop Corp. (GME) announcing massive fundraising in 2025 to do so.


 Strategy rarely pays cash for coins anymore. Instead, MSTR prefers to issue zero-coupon convertible notes with generous conversion premiums, effectively providing free money unless the stock tanks. It had already raised billions of dollars this way, part of a pattern that Bloomberg says has made convertible-arbitrage “Wall Street's hottest trade.”


 Issuing equity is another lever: during the first quarter of 2025 alone, Strategy sold $7.7 billion in new shares and then bought another 22,048 BTC at an average price of about $87,000.


 To back this financial engineering, Strategy's slide deck often highlights the following metrics:


 However, the math only works if Bitcoin continues to rise. A 30% slide in March briefly saddled the company with an unrealized $5.9 billion loss, rattling MSTR's share price. Analysts warn that prolonged crypto winters would squeeze cash flow and could force asset sales or refinancings that dilute shareholder value. Its zero-coupon structure, furthermore, can let bondholders demand cash back if volatility spikes, creating a reflexive risk loop for shareholders.


 Still, MSTR's recent inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 has meant that passive index funds tracking it have bought its shares, which will help cushion any potential drawdowns.


Investors looking to Strategy as a BTC play might be getting played themselves: At a market cap of $105.28 billion and bitcoin holdings at about $62.6 billion, that's almost a 70% premium over its BTC holdings. Compare that to most closed-end funds (where a 10% premium is pricey) or the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (BTC), where our calculations show a 3.2% discount of its share price to net asset value per share. For every $1.00 you invest, MSTR provides $0.59 worth of BTC exposure, whereas for the BTC ETF, you get $1.03.

 Strategy continues to sell its Strategy One analytics suite—an AI-infused business intelligence and data platform, which has sustained growth in subscriptions. The company also runs Strategy World, an annual technology conference that, in 2025, spotlighted new generative AI features rolling into its platform.


 Strategy has morphed from a middling BI vendor into a leveraged macro bet on Bitcoin, wrapped around its still-functioning software business. If the crypto bull run persists, shareholders will reap the gains from embedded leverage in both equity and convertibles. If the tide turns, however, the same leverage will magnify the drawdowns.

The U.S. Senate took the initial steps toward final approval of its first major crypto legislation as members opened voting Wednesday on the bill to set standards for U.S. stablecoin issuers, clearing the highest procedural hurdle with a 68-30 result.



In a moment that will mark the industry's greatest U.S. policy success to-date, the famously slow-moving Senate is on its way to clearing the legislation with wide bipartisan support. And as the crypto world watches the Senate reverse what had long been a crypto-resistant stance, the House of Representatives has also scored a pair of key votes to advance legislation even more vital to the industry: the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act that would establish a full set of rules managing U.S. oversight of the crypto markets.



In the Senate, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 (GENIUS) Act is the much-revised bill that had already garnered bipartisan approvals in multiple procedural votes and is now on what's expected to be an inevitable path Wednesday. The Senate needed to clear the high bar of 60 votes to move to the final vote, which was easily obtained as many Democrats joined Republicans in pushing forward toward stablecoin regulation.



The bill would establish a system under which stablecoins can be issued in the U.S. under the watch of state or federal regulators, and leaving some avenues for non-financial corporations to launch their own coins (a point of criticism from Democrats). Regulating these assets is fundamental to the operations of the crypto markets, in which dollar-based tokens such as Circle's USDC$0.99968 and Tether's USDT$1.00 are routinely used in transactions and contracts.

In the previous congressional session, what was then the Democrat-run Senate Banking Committee stood in the way of advancing crypto legislation, but its current Republican chairman, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, has become a crypto advocate. The chamber's overall pro-crypto sentiment has been growing stronger in this session and will be further cemented by Wednesday's votes. 

Before Wednesday's voting, the GENIUS Act's sponsor, Senator Bill Hagerty, asked his colleagues for support on the bill."This would strengthen our fiscal position and cement the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency," Hagerty argued. "If we fail to act now, not only will these benefits slip away, we'll also fall behind in global competitiveness without a regulatory framework.But Senator Elizabeth Warren, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, took to the Senate floor to blast the GENIUS Act. "The GENIUS Act lacks the basic safeguards necessary to ensure that stable coins don't blow up our entire financial system," the Massachusetts senator said. "The bill permits stablecoin issuers to invest in risky assets and allows them to engage in risky non-stablecoin activities like private credit or derivatives trading."Warren had a sharp message for fellow members of her party, many of whom were set to support the bill, that they "should show a little spine" and insist that Republicans allow some of the amendments pushed earlier by Democrats.



When the stablecoin bill is forwarded to the House, that leaves key decision in the hands of leaders there, whether to pair the GENIUS Act with the market structure effort, or to pursue it either as a straight-up vote on the Senate's version or a more complex process of melding the Senate's language with legislation already in the works in the House. Whatever happens, the House will need to match the Senate's approval at some point before a stablecoin bill can move to the president's desk to be signed into law.



While the GENIUS Act advanced, it followed a day of successes for proponents of the Clarity Act in the House, where that bill cleared the House Financial Services Committee and the House Ag Committee with big bipartisan votes in the same day on Tuesday.



Crypto lobbyists in Washington argue alongside their lawmakers allies that both bills are needed to properly regulate the industry in the U.S.

Senate Democrats Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal want Meta to explain what its stablecoin plans are.

In a letter sent to the social media giant on Wednesday, the lawmakers asked the company formerly known as Facebook to detail its stablecoin ambitions and pointed to previous reports about issues Meta has had with scams, "alleged anticompetitive conduct," and privacy issues.

Meta is considering using stablecoins for payments, Fortune reported last month.

"If Meta controlled its own stablecoin, the company could further pry into consumers' transactions and commercial activity," the letter said. "The massive amounts of consumer data it would ingest could help Meta fuel surveillance pricing schemes on its platform, more intrusive targeted advertising, or otherwise help the company monetize sensitive private information through sales to third party data brokers."

The letter included a list of questions, including whether Meta is thinking about launching its own stablecoin, whether it or any entity it's affiliated with has lobbied for the Senate or House's stablecoin bill or otherwise provided feedback on the bill. It also asked whether Meta would push back against an amendment that would block big tech firms from affiliating with or owning a stablecoin issuer.

It also asked the company to explain how its new stablecoin plan might differ from the now-defunct Libra (later Diem) project Meta spearheaded in 2019.

"The company tried to issue its own private currency in 2019 — as part of the so-called Libra stablecoin project — and was met with overwhelming bipartisan and international opposition," the letter noted.

A spokesperson for Meta did not immediately return a request for comment.

The letter comes the same day the Senate is set to vote on the GENIUS Act, its stablecoin bill. Though Senate Majority Leader John Thune said weeks ago that the body might consider amendments to the bill, he told Politico earlier this week that the path for amendments was less clear.

The bill is likely to pass without any amendments. Senator Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, told CoinDesk last week he expected 16 Democrats to support the bill alongside a majority of Republicans, easily clearing the 60-vote procedural threshold for cloture.

 Bitcoin enters a unique market phase as rising long-term holder dominance and compressed volatility could potentially trigger a fresh round of price discovery. 

Key takeaways: 

A unique divergence emerged as long-term Bitcoin holders took profits, while the overall supply held by this cohort continues to rise. 

Bitcoin's volatility has dropped to the 10th percentile, its lowest range in a decade, despite prices trading near all-time highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is hovering just a few percentage points below its all-time high of $111,800, and data from onchain analytics provider Glassnode reveals a “unique dynamic of this cycle,” as long-term holders continue to dominate wealth distribution, even at the later stage of the bull market. This behavior deviates sharply from previous cycles.

The data highlights that long-term holders (LTHs) — those holding BTC for over 155 days — are realizing significant profits, with their net realized profit/loss peaking at $930 million per day. Despite this, the overall supply held by LTHs is still rising. This is unprecedented at this stage of a rally, where LTH supply tends to decline due to widespread profit-taking. 

This dynamic implies that while some long-term investors are selling, an even larger volume of coins matures into long-term status. The report termed this a “unique duality” in market structure, where selling pressure is outweighed by ongoing accumulation. This change in holders' behavior has been largely attributed to institutional investors and US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which favor long-term custody. 

Further evidence of this late-cycle behavior appears in the realized profit/loss ratio, currently at 9.4, indicating that most long-term coins spent have been at substantial profit. Historically, such levels coincide with market euphoria and often precede a local or cycle top, although they can persist for months if demand sustains.

Bitcoin's current volatility profile presents a paradox. On one hand, realized supply density, which measures how concentrated Bitcoin's ownership is near the current price, has climbed in recent weeks. This signals that several investors bought around the $105,000-$110,000 level. In such tightly clustered environments, minor price swings can trigger outsized emotional or trading responses, raising the risk of sudden volatility.

On the other hand, contrary signals are coming from the derivatives market. At-the-money implied volatility (ATM IV) — a gauge of expected future price swings derived from Bitcoin options pricing — continues to fall across all timeframes. This suggests that traders aren't bracing for significant price dislocations soon.

Likewise, data from Ecoinometrics shows Bitcoin's weekly volatility has now dropped to the 10th percentile, lower than 90% of weeks in the last 10 years, despite Bitcoin setting a new all-time high and rallying strongly in May. It could signal that Bitcoin may be entering a new regime, reflecting strong performance without erratic price swings, which is an attractive setup for institutional investors focused on risk-adjusted returns.

With BTC price perched at the top of a dense supply cluster and institutional inflows anchoring demand, the market appears stable, but tightly wound. If new demand outpaces profit-taking, Bitcoin could burst through its volatility ceiling. But if sentiment cracks, the pullback may be sharper than expected.

A $1 million mansion in Kentucky owned by the crypto bros jailed for allegedly torturing a man for his digital coins was raided by authorities Tuesday.

The six-bedroom waterfront home in Smithland — which appears to be styled after the White House — was bought by self-styled “Crypto King of Kentucky” John Woeltz and his business partner William Duplessie for $1 million cash in January, multiple sources told The Post.

The house was raided by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and the NYPD, with support from the Kentucky State Police, according to a release from authorities.

Video of the raid obtained by The Post shows armored vehicles being brought by truck into the town, which has a population of less than 300, and a series of unmarked black SUVs and trucks at the property. It is unclear if anyone was there at the time of the raid.

Authorities have yet to say if anything was recovered from the property. Sources say one of the more unusual features of the house is a series of tunnels under it, accessible from the main house.

Woeltz, 33, and Duplessie, 37, are in jail over charges they allegedly held an associate, Michael Carturan, captive in another house they were renting in New York. They are alleged to have tortured him with a chainsaw while attempting to get him to hand over the password for his digital wallet containing $28 million in cryptocurrency over 17 days in May, according to prosecutors.

A neighbor who lived opposite Woeltz and Duplessie in Smithland told The Post: “The two men we now know as the ‘crypto bros' purchased the property at 101.

“There was talk they were looking at making the mansion a venue for events. They joined local societies and stuff like that and were trying to fit in.

“But there were all kinds of rumors going around. There was an awful lot of traffic, cars coming and going nonstop and stuff. At the same time there was an undercurrent that something wasn't right,” said Joshua Johnson, who lived opposite the mansion until recently.

New evidence against the pair was presented at a hearing Wednesday, where prosecutors accused them of holding another two people against their will and unveiled new evidence, including a photo of them setting Carturan, an Italian national, on fire.

Woeltz and Duplessie are charged with kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment and have both pleaded not guilty. Lawyers for both did not comment for this article.

Property deeds for the house obtained by The Post show it was bought by a Wyoming LLC, which was incorporated just weeks before the January 27 sale.

A source close to the sale told The Post: “Their cash was good and that's all I know.”

The stunning property boasts 10 bathrooms, an outdoor swimming pool and a tennis court, and sits on the bank of the Ohio River. Is known locally as the Strait house, after the family who previously lived there.

Carturan had raised the alarm against them after escaping from the house on Prince Street where he claimed he had been held and flagging down a traffic officer on May 23.

During their time in New York, Woeltz and Duplessie, who hails from Connecticut, gained a reputation for their hard partying and lavish spending.

Ether (ETH) ETH$2,799.75 drifted around $2,770 for most of Tuesday until roughly 8 p.m. ET, when officials said negotiators in London had forged a draft U.S.–China trade framework. The outline — till awaiting presidential approval — would see Beijing resume rare-earth exports while Washington eases curbs on advanced-technology sales.  

At 8:04 a.m. ET on Wednesday, former U.S. president Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that “OUR DEAL WITH CHINA IS DONE,” pending his and President Xi's formal approval. Trump claimed the accord would leave U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports effectively at 55 percent versus Beijing's 10 percent, promised that China would front-load supplies of magnets and other rare-earth materials, and said Washington would uphold concessions such as continued access for Chinese students to American universities, describing the bilateral relationship as “excellent.”

Hopes for a thaw in the multi-year tariff dispute sparked an initial risk-on bid: global equity futures firmed, bitcoin ticked higher and ether pushed to about $2,780 on expanding spot turnover.

Risk appetite intensified eleven hours later, around 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday, after the U.S. Labor Department reported that May headline and core CPI each rose just 0.1 percent month on month, undercutting economists' 0.2 percent forecasts. The cooler print fueled expectations the Federal Reserve could trim rates later this year, driving Treasury yields and the dollar lower while extending gains in equities. 

Against that macro backdrop, ether vaulted from the upper-$2,780s to an intraday high of $2,873.46, with spot volume swelling to roughly 527,000 coins (~$1.47 billion), according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model.

Structural tailwinds remain strong. Staked ETH climbed to a record 34.65 million tokens (≈28.7 percent of supply), exchange-traded funds logged a 16-day inflow streak near $900 million, and futures open interest printed a fresh high above $21.7 billion — all underscoring steady institutional engagement. BlackRock's reported $500 million accumulation over the past ten days exemplifies that theme.

Traders now look for a decisive close above $2,900 to open a potential run at the psychological $3,000 mark, while guarding against a pullback toward the newly established $2,750–$2,760 support band.

 As government overreach and institutional interests reshape the blockchain landscape, it's time to return to Bitcoin's founding vision: a truly decentralized, immutable currency free from state and corporate control. 

Opinion by: Dr. K, co-founder of Quai Network

While Bitcoin was intended to enable people to opt out of state-centralized money systems, the blockchain industry has since lost its way. Today, we see the threat of government overreach along with blockchain solutions that prioritize scalability and performance over decentralization. 

The rise of networks like Ethereum and Solana has certainly been captivating, but these blockchains comprise core values in exchange for usability and institutions' adoption. To achieve the mission that Satoshi started, there is a dire need to return to Bitcoin's original ethos of money, which is credibly neutral, immutable money that cannot be manipulated.

With a fixed supply of 21 million coins and regular halving events, Bitcoin exudes monetary certainty. No central authority or discovery can change Bitcoin's supply. This positions Bitcoin as an incredibly predictable store of value against the backdrop of money printing and rampant inflation, setting it apart from other forms of currency. Additionally, Bitcoin's rules are extremely difficult to change, which builds long-term trust in the network.

Key layer-1 (L1) players such as Ethereum and Solana offer unmatched flexibility and performance, but with an alarming trade-off. Ethereum's governance-led updates that affect gas fees and staking rewards don't always please those with ETH holdings. Moreover, Solana prioritizes speed and performance above all else, which leaves it vulnerable to increased levels of centralization. As a result of trade-offs, L1 networks like Ethereum and Solana are severely weakened in the face of censorship and manipulation, whether from governments, regulators, or powerful corporate interests.

As of March 2024, Coinbase controlled 3.84 million ETH staked on 120,000 validators, representing 11.42% of the total staked Ether, and is the largest solo Ethereum node operator. This concentration poses centralization issues, as a handful of large players, like Coinbase, could threaten Ethereum's decentralization and trigger regulatory risks. Additionally, it takes control away from the individual and places it back into the hands of a large, centralized corporation — the complete opposite of the original vision for cryptocurrency.

The crypto industry began as a rebellion against Big Tech and the gatekeeping of Silicon Valley, where only accredited investors could back startups and benefit from early-stage gains. Crypto flipped that paradigm on its head. For the first time, ordinary people, not VCs or insiders, could participate in creating new technologies from Day One. But now that the industry has had some time to mature, venture capital has reasserted itself, dispensing crypto in ways that appeal to the very systems it was trying to disrupt.

While venture capital hastens innovation, it also centralizes control through token distributions, board seats and control over product roadmaps. Solana is among the leading blockchains to have received lots of investment from firms such as a16z and Polychain Capital. This investment fuelled rapid growth but also created a centralization of tokens and decision-making powers among a handful of investors.

The most prominent crypto projects, like Ethereum and Solana — whether cynical of the old system or not — are ultimately built to serve institutions in their current state. Founding teams lock up large pre-mines, give favorably tilted terms to early investors, and structure incentives toward eventual exits rather than long-term decentralization. These behaviors reintroduce many similar power dynamics that Bitcoin sought to eliminate.

Decentralization is the essence of censorship resistance as well as individual economic liberty. Bitcoin's resistance to alteration protects it from being hijacked by powerful interests. Networks that see decentralization as a trade-off risk falling under the control of a new gatekeeper class. To preserve the promise of crypto, decentralization must remain the highest priority.

The strength of Bitcoin is in its neutrality and immutability, not its programmability or speed.

The crypto ecosystem needs to get back to these values to avoid repeating the mistakes of the traditional financial system. Rather than trends or institutional approval, the industry must recommit to developing instruments for absolute financial independence. Returning to Bitcoin's original vision is the only way to separate currency from the state and reclaim control over money through a trustless, censorship-resistant system.

Pudgy Penguins are getting their metaverse on again.

Not satisfied with staying confined to their own Pudgy World metaverse, Pudgy Penguins are expanding into a new virtual world, according to a press release shared with The Defiant. The beloved NFT brand is integrating with My Neighbor Alice, a web3 multiplayer game, as part of a broader partnership.

A core part of the partnership is a special zone in the game built for Pudgy Penguin NFT collection holders. My Neighbor Alice will feature a special Pudgy Land region in its new Snowflake Wilds, “a frosty, feel-good winter wonderland” area of the game.

While Snowflake Wilds are open to everyone, Pudgy Land is exclusively for owners of Pudgy Penguin NFTs, including Lil Pudgys and Pudgy Rod collection holders. Pudgy Land is a part of the game “where the community can hang out, quest, craft, and connect,” according to the press release.

Holders of Pudgy Penguins and Lil Pudgys will enter the game with their NFT as an egg that hatches to become their specific NFT. Holders of Pudgy Rods, which are fishing rods created to accompany each Pudgy Penguin NFT, will be able to equip them with custom fishing rod skins and use them to catch special fish.

“With this partnership we're pushing the envelope when it comes to interoperability,” said Steve Haßenpflug, vice president of games at ChromaWay and My Neighbor Alice in a statement, continuing:

My Neighbor Alice is built on the Chromia blockchain, where players can own, trade and sell virtual asset NFTs. Pudgy Penguins NFT collections are based on Ethereum.

The Pudgy Penguin brand's own Pudgy World metaverse, built on ZKSync, is currently in closed beta but promises to launch “soon.”

December's launch of the project's Solana-based PENGU token via airdrop was controversial, and characterized by high volatility for both the token and the NFT collection, with Pudgy Penguins' floor price spiking as high as 25 ETH as the launch approached. It is currently 9.24 ETH, according to NFTPriceFloor.

Last month, Pudgy Penguins waddled over to the TON blockchain, allowing 1 billion-plus Telegram users to play Pengu Clash, a multiplayer skill game with mini-games like darts, football and bomber with token-based incentives, tournament rules, unlockable gear, accessories and team cosmetics, according to Pudgy Penguins. It is “pay-to-win” free, the company said in a release.

Also in May, Pudgy Penguins revealed that it was expanding its off-chain activities beyond physical plushies to publishing a children's book with Random House titled “The Worst Birthday Present Ever.”

NFT prices have dropped dramatically since the airdrop high, which lasted through January, but could be going up if the Securities and Exchange Commission green-lights Canary Capital's proposed Pudgy Penguin ETF, which will hold PENGU tokens as well as up to 15% of its assets in Pudgy Penguin NFTs.

PENGU is up about 2% on the day and 16% on the week, according to The Defiant's price data.

The Hyperliquid platform's native token, HYPE, is today the strongest performer among top 15 assets by market cap—excluding stablecoins. Its seven-day gains have outpaced major altcoins as Bitcoin volatility posts record lows for the year, pushing a relatively stable trading pattern.

HYPE traded at $41.31, down 0.3% on the day, yet maintaining strong momentum with 12.4% weekly gains and 67.2% monthly appreciation, according to data from CoinGecko. It has sustained this uptrend since mid-May, with recent price action pushing HYPE back toward monthly highs around the $42 range.

Compared to established altcoins, heightened investor interest around HYPE "reflects both speculative momentum and deeper fundamentals like ecosystem growth and institutional interest," Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at crypto and quantitative trading firm Kronos Research, told Decrypt.

For instance, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin posted modest gains, extending their upward momentum as the broader crypto market remains relatively stable.

Over the week, ETH has climbed 7%, SOL by 7.3%, and DOGE by 4.4% over the same stretch. All three are showing signs of recovery from late-May lows, but remain well below recent local highs.

Bitcoin, meanwhile, posted record lows for implied volatility, which gauges how much of its spot price could move further, based on options prices.

Of the four, Liu suggests "a mix of retail hype in DOGE and HYPE, alongside real progress in ETH and SOL" is taking shape.

But while the upswing "has legs short‑term, driven by liquidity, retail energy, and fresh institutional interest," Liu acknowledged how broader macro factors are still at play, citing how "tariff headlines and dollar strength" ratios add friction to the fray.

"Long‑term upside hinges on macro stability and clear regulation," Liu told Decrypt.

The same factors could be drawn on Bitcoin, whose new highs have been “fueled by increasingly hard-to-ignore institutional participation,” and as such has “reignited optimism across the entire crypto space,” encouraging “renewed retail interest and appetite for altcoins perceived as strong projects or community favorites,” Jeth Ang, chief operating officer at modular onchain platform Sovrun, told Decrypt.

"This institutional momentum creates a positive feedback loop, encouraging renewed retail interest and appetite for altcoins perceived as strong projects or community favorites," he added, saying that one of the things helping HYPE is its simple yet effective token design.

"This clarity, combined with growing regulatory optimism, strengthens the case not only for $HYPE but also for crypto's evolving role as a credible, revenue-generating asset class," Ang said.

Interest in Hyperliquid has resulted in "consistently high organic usage" as it competes with "centralized derivative exchanges like Binance and Bybit," analysts at investment firm Grayscale wrote last week, citing how the decentralized exchange has attracted users for its perpetual futures offerings, as fiscal risks generated broader demand for Bitcoin and other cryptos.

In crypto, perpetual futures are derivatives contracts that never expire, allowing traders to speculate on price movements indefinitely without taking delivery of the underlying asset.

The idea was first proposed in 1992 by American economist and Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller. It later gained traction and now accounts for roughly 93% of all derivatives trading in crypto, according to industry estimates.

Last month, Hyperliquid joined a group of other top exchanges responding to the SEC's call on perpetuals, citing how "continuous, on-chain markets" such as its platform "already meet—and in several respects exceed" what the regulator requires "for resilience and customer protection."

 Bitcoin may see more upside if the world's two largest trading nations finalize their tariff deal and end global economic uncertainty. 

Bitcoin is closing in on a new high, buoyed by renewed optimism that the United States and China have reached a final agreement on their long-awaited trade deal.

The world's largest trading economies have nearly completed their trade agreement, according to a Wednesday post on Truth Social by US President Donald Trump.

“Our deal with China is done, subject to final approval with President Xi and me,” Trump said. “We are getting a total of 55% tariffs, China is getting 10%. Relationship is excellent.”

While the US-China deal “appears to defuse some tensions over rare earth exports, concrete policy shifts remain elusive,” said Nexo dispatch analyst Iliya Kalchev, who told Cointelegraph that Wall Street futures saw a minor decline after the news.

Bitcoin (BTC) price peaked at a 24-hour high below $110,300, before retracing to $109,560 as of 1:04 pm UTC on Wednesday, TradingView data shows.

“Almost all the other tariff negotiations and rhetoric are all about getting China to agree to a deal,” said Global Macro Investor founder and CEO Raoul Pal.

The rest of the negotiations may only be “posturing” for a trade agreement with mainland China, he wrote in an April 8 X post.

On Tuesday, China's Vice Commerce Minister, Li Chenggang, said the two sides have reached an in-principle agreement to resolve trade disputes through mutually beneficial cooperation.

The two sides had “candid and in-depth talks” during the London negotiations, Chenggang told Chinese news outlet Chinadaily.

The developments may provide significant relief for crypto investors since Trump's reciprocal trade tariffs were seen as the biggest macroeconomic threat to traditional equities and cryptocurrency markets in 2025.

Bitcoin briefly fell to a year-to-date low of $74,434 on April 7, five days after Trump announced his reciprocal import tariffs on April 2, which resulted in the S&P 500 losing more than $5 trillion in value, its largest drop to date.

Tariff-related uncertainty also affected venture capitalist (VC) appetite, with crypto VC deals falling to 62 investment rounds in May, marking a monthly low for 2025, Cointelegraph reported.

The slowdown was mainly attributed to a “combination of market prices and sentiment,” as both took a hit on the “deterioration of tariff rhetoric,” said Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at crypto intelligence platform Nansen.

To extend everyday payments, remittances, and 'PayFi' solutions to millions of users and merchants 

NEW YORK, June 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- PayPal today announced plans to make the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin available on the Stellar network pending regulatory approval by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)1. Stellar is a blockchain designed for fast, low-cost payments and real-world utility. By potentially expanding to Stellar, PYUSD leverages the network's speed, low transaction costs, and ease of integration to enhance its utility for real-world payments, commerce, and micro-financing, offering an additional option to Ethereum and Solana.



PYUSD on Stellar can be used for fast, affordable cross-border payments and expanded access to essential financial services while bridging the digital and physical world with a vast array of on and off ramps. Users may also benefit from improved daily payment options and financing solutions such as working capital and business loans - use cases already thriving on the Stellar network - ultimately enabling a more seamless flow of value across global markets.

"For years, stablecoins have been deemed crypto's 'killer app' by combining the power of the blockchain with the stability of fiat currency. As we see cross border payments being a key area where digital currencies can provide real world value, working with Stellar will help advance the use of this technology and provide benefits for all users," said May Zabaneh, Vice President of the Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and Digital Currency Group, PayPal.

An expansion on Stellar would give PYUSD users access to its vast network of on and off ramps, providing additional access through digital wallets, and connected to local payment systems and cash networks. Access to extensive Stellar infrastructure will enhance how people can use PYUSD in their everyday financial activities, from payments to remittances to merchant services.

"Stellar is the network for fast, low-cost, and trusted global payments at scale. By bringing PYUSD to 170+ countries, we're transforming stablecoins into practical financial tools that millions of everyday users and merchants can actually use," shared Denelle Dixon, Chief Executive Officer of Stellar Development Foundation. "Together, we are bringing stable digital currency to small businesses and individuals in emerging markets all over the globe."

PYUSD on Stellar can also enhance liquidity and financing opportunities through Payment Financing or 'PayFi', an emerging innovation in digital finance. Small and medium-sized businesses that face delayed receivables or pre-funding requirements would be able to access new sources of real-time working capital, disbursed in PYUSD. This capital can be used to pay suppliers, manage inventory, or address other operational needs – with instant settlement on Stellar. Liquidity providers can fund these opportunities and earn potential, sustainable benefits from real-world economic activity. 

PYUSD on Stellar can drive efficient modernized money movement, cost transparency, and minimize settlement delays by unlocking better borderless financial flows.

87 new projects coming as Ripple and Peersyst Technology lower entry barriers for developers using Ethereum tools.

After years of testing, the XRP Ledger will finally launch its Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible sidechain in the second quarter of 2025.

Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz confirmed the timeline at the Apex 2025 event, a move that integrates Ethereum's smart contract capabilities into the XRPL ecosystem.

The development aims to expand XRP's utility beyond its traditional payment role by addressing alleged limitations in DeFi's programmability.

Developed in a joint effort by Ripple and Peersyst Technology, the sidechain provides full EVM compatibility, allowing developers to deploy applications using established Ethereum tools like Solidity, MetaMask, and Truffle. Transactions on the network will utilize wrapped XRP (wXRP) as the native gas token.

The Axelar network will function as the exclusive bridge for transferring assets, including the XRP required to create wXRP, between the XRPL mainnet and the new EVM sidechain. The architecture connects XRPL to the more than 69 other blockchain ecosystems supported by Axelar.

The sidechain operates on a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, selected for performance and efficiency. Its targeted metrics are over 1,000 transactions per second and transaction costs below $0.01.

To ensure network integrity, the sidechain's code underwent a security audit by Informal Systems in February 2025. The audit identified and led to the resolution of one critical issue related to a Cosmos SDK module, with other findings being of low risk.

This initiative represents a strategic effort to attract developers from the larger EVM ecosystem and provide new avenues for applications on the XRP Ledger. By lowering the barrier to entry, the sidechain may foster a more diverse application environment for XRPL's user base, which holds over six million wallets.

The use of wXRP for transaction fees introduces a new demand mechanism for the XRP token, tying its utility directly to the activity level on the EVM sidechain. This could extend its tokenomics beyond its primary function in facilitating cross-border settlements.

Activity on the sidechain's testnet suggests initial developer interest. According to a post from Peersyst, projects including Strobe Finance, Vertex Protocol, and Secured Labs are already building applications.

The firm also reported that 87 new entities with no prior involvement in the XRP ecosystem are now contributing on the testnet, suggesting the potential for broad ecosystem growth upon the mainnet's release.

The project's structure as a sidechain allows these new capabilities to be introduced without altering the XRPL mainnet's core protocol, which remains optimized for payments. The mainnet launch of the XRPL EVM Sidechain is scheduled to proceed in the second quarter of 2025.

Oops, something went wrong

By Leika Kihara

TOKYO (Reuters) -Bank of Japan officials are ramping up calls to keep pace with rapid developments around digital currencies that may accelerate a shift to cashless payments in a country better known for its belief that "cash is king."

Once seen as a society favouring physical currency, Japan saw the ratio of cashless payments rise to 42.8% in 2024, up from 13.2% in 2010 and hitting the government's 40% goal a year earlier than targeted, government data showed.

While Japan is a global laggard on payment technology, the increase in cashless transactions is forcing policymakers to ensure they are ready to adapt to shifting public preference on payment and settlement means.

This includes the option of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). While no decision has been made on whether to issue a digital yen, the BOJ began a pilot programme for developing a CBDC in 2023, and has been consulting with private firms and the government on its framework and design.

"Although banknote issuance remains high in Japan, usage of notes could fall significantly in the future amid rapid digitalisation," BOJ Executive Director Kazushige Kamiyama told a meeting last week with private firms on the pilot programme.

"As such, Japan must consider what steps it can take now to ensure its retail settlement system is convenient, efficient, accessible universally, while being safe and resilient."

BOJ Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida said a CBDC may become "a critical piece of infrastructure" shaping the future of Japan's payment and settlement systems, but stressed that he did not expect demand for cash to disappear in Japan any time soon.

In his speech on Saturday, Uchida spoke about a hypothetical world in which the yen is overtaken by another instrument - such as crypto assets - as the main form of payment in Japan.

Such a world would not occur as long as the public believes in the BOJ's ability to keep the value of the yen stable, which could come into question if the central bank fails to fulfil its mission of price stability, Uchida said.

"Looking to the future, in a society that has made significant advances in digitalization, there is no guarantee that currency issued by the central bank of a sovereign nation will continue to function as a generally acceptable payment instrument," he said.

CBDCs are back in the spotlight after U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in January banning the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar, seemingly as part of a drive to promote cryptocurrencies and stablecoins instead.

The growing presence of stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies backed by a hard currency, and the potential risk of an erosion in the U.S. dollar's dominance have also piled pressure on central banks to consider issuing their own digital currencies.

The European Central Bank has called for the need to issue a digital euro to respond to Trump's push to promote stablecoins, and develop an electronic means of payment that does not rely on dominant U.S. providers such as Visa.

China is racing ahead with global ambitions to internationalise the yuan with transactions of the digital yuan more than tripling between June 2023 and June 2024.

Brian Quintenz, President Donald Trump's pick for Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), stated during a nomination hearing on Tuesday that he would focus on a tech-first approach toward crypto regulations under his administration.

During a nomination hearing with members of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, President Trump's CFTC nominee, Brian Quintenz, stated that the CFTC would adopt a tech-forward approach toward cryptocurrency regulations if Congress grants it oversight authority.

He emphasized that the CFTC possesses the technological capability and regulatory experience necessary to oversee the digital asset market effectively.

Senator Ben Luján inquired about his plans to address anti-money laundering (AML) breaches related to cryptocurrency, citing that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has recently stepped back from enforcement. Quintenz said that crypto providers would likely be subject to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) laws, which currently regulate other financial entities. 

When asked about a crypto market structure bill, Quintenz shared that he views the legislation as a way to combine customer protection with innovation.

"I have always viewed market structure legislation as an opportunity to be both pro-customer protection and pro-innovation at the same time," Quintenz stated.

Quintenz further answered questions on prediction markets, drawing from his experience as a board member at Kalshi. He defended event contracts as legitimate financial instruments, describing them as effective tools for hedging real-world risks.

"I believe the Commodity Exchange Act is very clear about the purpose of derivatives markets, the purpose of risk management and price discovery, and that events can serve a function in that mandate," he said.

Before accepting the presidential nomination to be CFTC Chairman, Quintenz worked as a16z Crypto's Global Head of Policy, where he collaborated with several cryptocurrency startups.

He stated at the hearing that this could be the most exciting time to lead as Chairman of the agency, considering the larger shift toward crypto regulations. Quintenz also previously worked as a CFTC Commissioner from 2017 to 2021 and has been an advocate of innovation.

If approved by the Committee, he will proceed to a full Senate vote before being inaugurated as the new CFTC Chairman by President Trump.

A widely followed crypto strategist thinks that a correction in one safe-haven asset will likely trigger risk-on behavior that could benefit altcoins.

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe tells his 791,800 followers on the social media platform X that he's keeping a close watch on gold's price action, noting that the precious metal's chart is the “most important chart to watch” this week.

According to the trader, gold appears to have printed a bearish lower high setup on the six-hour chart, suggesting that the precious metal could fall to as low as $3,200 in the near term.

“As long as Gold stays sub-$3,365, we're likely going to see a sharp fall in the coming one to two weeks of anything between 4-10%, resulting into a sudden macroeconomic shift.” 

Van de Poppe believes that falling gold prices will be beneficial for altcoins, as it suggests an increased appetite for risk among investors.

“At the end of [last] week, a sudden [gold] correction took place, which might result in the confirmation of a short-term downtrend.

This is vital, as that would attract more investors towards Altcoins.

Why?

It would enable more investors to be jumping into risk-on assets, when gold implies that it continues to fall.

This means –> money/liquidity flows from risk-off assets towards risk-on assets, and the best asset class remains to be crypto.” 

But the trader warns that altcoins will likely see lower levels if gold shatters $3,365.

“If it does break above that crucial level, the theory is invalidated, and we're likely open for printing new highs, which then means that we're printing new lows on altcoins.

For me, this is crucial, as a correction in Gold and rally in the CNH (offshore Chinese renminbi) implies that we're going to be seeing more interest flowing into crypto after that.”

At time of writing, gold is trading for $3,324, up more than 60% in the last 18 months.

Metrics details

Developing bioelectronics capable of stably tracking brain-wide, single-cell, millisecond-resolved neural activity in the developing brain is critical for advancing neuroscience and understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. During development, the three-dimensional structure of the vertebrate brain arises from a two-dimensional neural plate1,2. These large morphological changes have previously posed a challenge for implantable bioelectronics to reliably track neural activity throughout brain development3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Here we introduce a tissue-level-soft, submicrometre-thick mesh microelectrode array that integrates into the embryonic neural plate by leveraging the tissue's natural two-dimensional-to-three-dimensional reconfiguration. As organogenesis progresses, the mesh deforms, stretches and distributes throughout the brain, seamlessly integrating with neural tissue. Immunostaining, gene expression analysis and behavioural testing confirm no adverse effects on brain development or function. This embedded electrode array enables long-term, stable mapping of how single-neuron activity and population dynamics emerge and evolve during brain development. In axolotl models, it not only records neural electrical activity during regeneration but also modulates the process through electrical stimulation.

The dashed line circle highlights the portion of the mesh which remains exterior to the tadpole brain. e, Stress-strain curve of PFPE-DMA film with 8 kDa molecular weight, the blue dashed line indicates a linear relationship. f, Stretchability of 8 kDa PFPE-DMA and SU-8 films. g, Surface free energy of 8 kDa PFPE-DMA film and SU-8 films. h, Contact angle of phospholipid (cell membrane analog) on 8 kDa PFPE-DMA film, and on SU-8 film. Bar plots indicate mean ± s.e.m., each dot represents a sample, n = 5. i, Photographic images showing an embryo successfully implanted with a PFPE-DMA mesh. The dashed line circle highlights the portion of the mesh which remains exterior to the tadpole brain. j, Schematics showing how anchors fix the stretchable mesh electronics to the substrate, keeping the neural plate properly positioned during neurulation for device internalization, and keeping the stretchable mesh electrode array attached to the neural plate. The device's initial dimensions and stretchability enable the stage 15 embryo to be slid under the device for implantation. k, The design of the stretchable mesh electronics showing the architecture of the stretchable mesh electrode array, stretchable serpentine interconnects, anchors, stretchable ribbons, and blockers. The blocker prevents the mesh electrodes from implanting into the caudal region of the neural plate. l, Schematics showing elongation of the neural tube during the embryo development of Xenopus laevis. The caudal region of the neural tube elongates to 3 times its initial length and forms the spinal cord while the cranial region elongates only 1.3 times its initial length and forms the brain.

a, Schematics showing the setup for behavioral testing. In each test, a tadpole is placed in a clear tank, sitting on an upward-facing screen. The screen is programmed to display the appropriate stimulation pattern for the color preference, visual avoidance, and edge preference tests. In the color preference test, the screen alternated between displaying half white and half black for 40 s each. In the visual avoidance test, a black dot is directly controllable via a computer mouse. The operator moved the dot toward the tadpole. If the tadpole responded, the operator would proceed to initiate the next encounter. If the tadpole did not respond, the operator would initiate a new encounter after five seconds. In the edge preference test, the entire screen is white. The setup is placed inside a dark box to minimize light contamination. The interior of the box is coated black to minimize reflections from the screen. Tadpoles are recorded using a video camera pointed down on the tank through a hole in the top of the box. b-i, Time-lapse snapshots of a visual avoidance video showing the trajectory process of a behaving tadpole.

Metrics details

Conservation of damaged oil paintings requires manual inpainting of losses1,2, leading to months-long treatments of considerable expense; 70% of paintings in institutional collections are locked away from public view, in part because of treatment cost3,4. Recent advancements in digital image reconstruction have helped to envision treatment results, although without any direct means of achieving them5,6,7,8. Here I describe the physically applied digital restoration of a painting, a highly damaged oil-on-panel attributed to the Master of the Prado Adoration from the late fifteenth century. In parallel, 5,612 losses spanning 66,205 mm2 and 57,314 colours were infilled with a reversible laminate mask comprising a colour-accurate bilayer of printed pigments on polymeric films. To ensure the effectiveness of the restoration, ethical principles in painting conservation were implemented quantitatively for digital mask construction, a critically important foundation lacking in the current digital restoration literature. The infill process took 3.5 h, an estimated 66 times faster than conventional inpainting, and the result closely matched the simulation. This approach grants greatly increased foresight and flexibility to conservators, enabling the restoration of countless damaged paintings deemed unworthy of high conservation budgets.

Four broad types of damage are shown overlayed onto the damaged image of the painting. Three complete panel fissures stem from warping of the wood support boards.

All images are of identical scale and rotated to angularly align with each other. Three infants from other paintings by MPA are shown, with the lower row of images corresponding to 50% opacity overlays on the damaged infant in the painting used in this study. a, The damaged infant in the painting used in this study. b, Infant from the Nativity held by the Birmingham Museums Trust. c, Infant from: Master of the Prado Adoration, Adoration of the Magi, 1460–1470, Oil, Height: 60 cm; Width: 55 cm, (P001558).

a, Cross-sectional diagram of bilayer alignment, showing misaligned white and color ink layers relative to the area of damage. Below are two plots of the damage. Absolute damage solely includes the exposed damage and overfilling. Perceived damage more closely follows the visual effect as seen by a human observer; the sharply contrasting exposed white ink layer is more damaging visually than overfilling. b, Area expansion diagram of layer alignment, showing a circular damaged region and a masking color ink region that is radially expanded. c, Plot of the minimum restorable cross-sectional feature dimension as a function of the combined lateral alignment tolerance and the target restoration effectiveness. In this work, the combined tolerance of 161.2 µm and restoration effectiveness of 1.0 (intersection denoted by star) leads to a calculated minimum restorable dimension of 511 µm. d, Plot of the minimum restorable feature radius as a function of alignment tolerance.

a, Base images are prepared for further processing through brightening, blurring, and coordinate conversion. b, The base mask is constructed through analysis of human-perceived visual differences and identification of features based on contrast with local context. Further processing accounts for tolerance analysis. c, Manual adjustments and final corrections are made to the base mask, which is split for fabrication.

a, General artifacts are initially identified through thresholding perceived differences in value and saturation. b, Following application of tolerance analysis-driven considerations, larger areas end up consolidated with the majority of microscopic regions excluded. c, Contextual features, which are more easily visually perceived owing to their contrast with a uniform background, are separately masked. d, The combined general artifacts and contextual features mask spans most areas that require infilling based on human visual perception. e, Manual additions incorporate large area losses, such as the exposed panel support around the edges of the work, that are not visually significant from an algorithmic standpoint but are identifiable by a human viewer based on broader context. f, The final masking areas overlayed on the damaged painting.

a, Scatter plot of all 57,314 colors used in the infill mask on HSV axes, with log color scale denoting the number of pixels each color is used for. b, Histogram of infill mask colors based on the number of pixels each color is used for. The vast majority of colors represent regions smaller than 10,000 px2 (17.9 mm2). c, Histogram of the number of color variants (i.e., combinations of value and saturation) per hue.

a, The simulated overlay of the digital mask on the image of the damaged painting. b, The physical restoration result, of remarkable similarity to the simulated version.

a, After 2 months of storage, the applied laminate mask can be removed from the painting at the weaker interface of the varnish layer and applied mask, with solvent application assisting in areas with remaining mask fragments. b, A small segment of a fabricated infill mask is placed in a beaker with white spirit. c, After a minute, the infill mask is dissolved.

The physical laminate masking approach and digital mask construction enable the testing of different restorations in a vastly expedited time frame. A physical restoration based on a different infill mask is depicted here. a, The infill mask areas, which were constructed with a lower visually-perceived difference threshold and more aggressively target losses than the final mask used in this work. b, The color infill mask, which was color-adjusted to a higher color value. c, The physical restoration attempt, showing good color matching with the sky and poorer color matching in darker areas of the painting, with infill regions more easily distinguishable as compared to the final restoration in this work.

Metrics details

Lipids are essential components of cancer cells due to their structural and signalling roles1. To meet metabolic demands, many cancers take up extracellular lipids2,3,4,5; however, how these lipids contribute to cancer growth and progression remains poorly understood. Here, using functional genetic screens, we identify uptake of lipoproteins—the primary mechanism for lipid transport in circulation—as a key determinant of ferroptosis sensitivity in cancer. Lipoprotein supplementation robustly inhibits ferroptosis across diverse cancer types, primarily through the delivery of α-tocopherol (α-toc), the most abundant form of vitamin E in human lipoproteins. Mechanistically, cancer cells take up lipoproteins through a pathway dependent on sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) linked to cell-surface proteoglycans. Disrupting GAG biosynthesis or acutely degrading surface GAGs reduces lipoprotein uptake, sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis and impairs tumour growth in mice. Notably, human clear cell renal cell carcinomas—a lipid-rich malignancy—exhibit elevated levels of chondroitin sulfate and increased lipoprotein-derived α-toc compared with normal kidney tissue. Together, our study establishes lipoprotein uptake as a critical anti-ferroptotic mechanism in cancer and implicates GAG biosynthesis as a therapeutic target.

Metrics details

Eutyrannosaurians were large predatory dinosaurs that dominated Asian and North American terrestrial faunas in latest Cretaceous times. These apex predators arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids during the ‘middle' Cretaceous that are poorly known owing to the paucity of fossil material1,2,3. Here we report on a new tyrannosauroid, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis gen. et sp. nov., from lower Upper Cretaceous deposits of Mongolia that provides a new perspective on eutyrannosaurian origins and evolution. Phylogenetic analyses recover Khankhuuluu immediately outside Eutyrannosauria and recover the massive, deep-snouted Tyrannosaurini and the smaller, gracile, shallow-snouted Alioramini as highly derived eutyrannosaurian sister clades. Khankhuuluu and the late-diverging Alioramini independently share features related to a shallow skull and gracile build with juvenile eutyrannosaurians, reinforcing the key role heterochrony had in eutyrannosaurian evolution. Although eutyrannosaurians were mainly influenced by peramorphosis or accelerated growth4,5,6,7,8,9,10, Alioramini is revealed as a derived lineage that retained immature features through paedomorphosis and is not a more basal lineage as widely accepted11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. Our results reveal that Asian tyrannosauroids (similar to Khankhuuluu) dispersed to North America, giving rise to Eutyrannosauria in the mid-Late Cretaceous. Eutyrannosauria diversified and remained exclusively in North America until a single dispersal to Asia in the latest Cretaceous that established Alioramini and Tyrannosaurini. Stark morphological differences between Alioramini and Tyrannosaurini probably evolved due to divergent heterochronic trends—paedomorphosis versus peramorphosis, respectively—allowing them to coexist in Asia and occupy different ecological niches.

Cladogram with examples of Tyrannosaurinae skulls, including: a, Bistahieversor, b, Daspletosaurus, c, Alioramus (Alioramini), and d, Tyrannosaurus (Tyrannosaurini). Alioramini is supported as both a highly derived member of Tyrannosaurinae and as a sister taxon to the Tyrannosaurini by numerous unambiguous and exclusive synapomorphies. See Supplementary Information 8 for a full list of synapomorphies.

Taxa excluded from the comprehensive analysis depicted in Fig. 3 are Kileskus, Juratyrant, Sinotyrannus, Stokesososaurus, Timurlengia, Alectrosaurus, Dryptosaurus, Nanuqsaurus, Thanatotheristes, and Zhuchengtyrannus. Values adjacent to nodes denote node support values: Bremer supports (left values < 20), bootstrap indices (right values > 50). Bremer support values and bootstrap indices increase significantly for most clades relative to those clades in the comprehensive analysis in Fig. 3. Among derived tyrannosaurine taxa (e.g., Alioramini+Tyrannosaurini), higher node values are found here relative to similar positions in the comprehensive tree in Fig. 3. This reveals that lower overall support values in the comprehensive tree is primarily due to ambiguity incurred in character state transformations with the inclusion of highly fragmentary taxa, particularly in late-diverging tyrannosauroids (e.g., Nanuqsaurus [8.1% of characters scored], Thanatotheristes [19.0%] Zhuchengtyrannus [10.3%]).

Supporting information for main text includes measurements and ontogenetic assessment for Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, supplementary discussions for the phylogenetic position of Alioramini, phylogenetic protocols including taxon and character omissions, character list, clade synapomorphies, Templeton's test results, and additional tests of time calibration.

Sea cucumbers are the ocean's janitors, cleaning the seabed and recycling nutrients back into the water. But this humble marine invertebrate could also hold the key to stopping the spread of cancer.

A sugar compound found in sea cucumbers can effectively block Sulf-2, an enzyme that plays a major role in cancer growth, according to a University of Mississippi-led study published in Glycobiology. 

"Marine life produces compounds with unique structures that are often rare or not found in terrestrial vertebrates," said Marwa Farrag, a fourth-year doctoral candidate in the UM Department of BioMolecular Sciences.

"And so, the sugar compounds in sea cucumbers are unique. They aren't commonly seen in other organisms. That's why they're worth studying."

Farrag, a native of Assiut, Egypt, and the study's lead author, worked with a team of researchers from Ole Miss and Georgetown University on the project.

Human cells, and those of most mammals, are covered in tiny, hairlike structures called glycans that help with cell communication, immune responses and the recognition of threats such as pathogens. Cancer cells alter the expression of certain enzymes, including Sulf-2, which in turn modifies the structure of glycans. This modification helps cancer spread.

"The cells in our body are essentially covered in 'forests' of glycans," said Vitor Pomin, associate professor of pharmacognosy. "And enzymes change the function of this forest - essentially prunes the leaves of that forest.

"If we can inhibit that enzyme, theoretically, we are fighting against the spread of cancer."

Using both computer modeling and laboratory testing, the research team found that the sugar - fucosylated chondroitin sulfate - from the sea cucumber Holothuria floridana can effectively inhibit Sulf-2.

"We were able to compare what we generated experimentally with what the simulation predicted, and they were consistent," said Robert Doerksen, professor of medicinal chemistry. "That gives us more confidence in the results."

Unlike other Sulf-2 regulating medications, the sea cucumber compound does not interfere with blood clotting, said Joshua Sharp, UM associate professor of pharmacology.

"As you can imagine, if you are treating a patient with a molecule that inhibits blood coagulation, then one of the adverse effects that can be pretty devastating is uncontrolled bleeding," he said. "So, it's very promising that this particular molecule that we're working with doesn't have that effect."

As a marine-based cancer therapy, the sea cucumber compound may be easier to create and safer to use.

"Some of these drugs we have been using for 100 years, but we're still isolating them from pigs because chemically synthesizing it would be very, very difficult and very expensive," Sharp said. "That's why a natural source is really a preferred way to get at these carbohydrate-based drugs."

Unlike extracting carbohydrate-based drugs from pigs or other land mammals, extracting the compound from sea cucumbers does not carry a risk of transferring viruses and other harmful agents, Pomin said.

"It's a more beneficial and cleaner resource," he said. "The marine environment has many advantages compared to more traditional sources."

But sea cucumbers - some variants of which are a culinary delicacy in the Pacific Rim - aren't so readily abundant that scientists could go out and harvest enough to create a line of medication. The next step in the research is to find a way to synthesize the sugar compound for future testing.

"One of the problems in developing this as a drug would be the low yield, because you can't get tons and tons of sea cucumbers," Pomin said. "So, we have to have a chemical route, and when we've developed that, we can begin applying this to animal models."

The interdisciplinary nature of the scientific study, which featured researchers from chemistry, pharmacognosy and computational biology, underscored the importance of cross-disciplinary collaboration in tackling complex diseases like cancer, Pomin said.

"This research took multiple expertise - mass spectrometry, biochemistry, enzyme inhibition, computation," Pomin said. "It's the effort of the whole team."

Metrics details

Silicon has enabled advancements in semiconductor technology through miniaturization, but scaling challenges necessitate the exploration of new materials1. Two-dimensional (2D) materials, with their atomic thickness and high carrier mobility, offer a promising alternative2,3,4,5. Although significant progress has been made in wafer-scale growth6,7,8, high-performance field-effect transistors9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 and circuits based on 2D materials21,22,23, achieving complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) integration remains a challenge. Here, we present a 2D one instruction set computer based on CMOS technology, leveraging the heterogeneous integration of large-area n-type MoS2 and p-type WSe2 field-effect transistors. By scaling the channel length, incorporating a high-κ gate dielectric and optimizing material growth and device postprocessing, we tailored the threshold voltages for both n- and p-type 2D field-effect transistors, achieving high drive currents and reduced subthreshold leakage. This enabled circuit operation below 3 V with an operating frequency of up to 25 kHz, which was constrained by parasitic capacitances, along with ultra-low power consumption in the picowatt range and a switching energy as low as approximately 100 pJ. Finally, we projected the performance of the one instruction set computer and benchmarked it against state-of-the-art silicon technology using an industry-standard SPICE-compatible BSIM-BULK model. This model was calibrated with experimental data that incorporate device-to-device variations. Although further advances are needed, this work marks a significant milestone in the application of 2D materials to microelectronics.

Solar power is growing by leaps and bounds in the United States, propelled by climate mitigation policies and carbon-free energy goals -- and California is leading the way as the nation's top producer of solar electricity. A new study in Energy Strategy Reviews has revealed a dark side to the state's breakneck pace for solar investment, deployment, and adoption, taking a first-time look at patterns of public and private sector corruption in the California solar market.

Researchers at the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability (IGS) have identified seven distinct types of corruption abuses and risks in California solar energy. Among them, favoritism in project approvals, including a high-profile incident at the senior ranks of the U.S. Department of the Interior involving an intimate relationship with a solar company lobbyist. To fully realize a just energy transition, the authors call for major solar reforms in California as the U.S. increasingly relies on solar energy to decarbonize its electricity sector.

"It's a wake-up call that the solar industry cannot continue on its current trajectory of bad governance and bad behavior."

"In this groundbreaking study, we find that efforts to accelerate solar infrastructure deployment in California end up contributing to a sobering array of corruption practices and risks. These include shocking abuses of power in the approval and licensing phases as well as the displacement of Indigenous groups, and also nefarious patterns of tax evasion or the falsification of information about solar projects," says lead author Benjamin Sovacool, who is the director of IGS and a Boston University professor of earth and environment. "It's a wake-up call that the solar industry cannot continue on its current trajectory of bad governance and bad behavior."

Drawing on a literature review and original interviews and fieldwork, the study's authors arrive at a framework that helps explore the wider socio-political realities driving corruption at a time of explosive growth in the California solar market, from 2010 to 2024. During this period, the state's solar energy production increased exponentially, reaching 79,544 gigawatt hours in 2024, or enough to power approximately 7.4 million U.S. households for a year, according to the State of Renewable Energy dashboard.

The research implicates solar energy in numerous corruption practices and risks that have adversely affected communities, policymaking and regulation, and siting decisions and planning.

"The most eye-opening finding for me is how common corruption is at every level of solar development, from small-scale vendors to high-level government officials, even in a well-regulated, progressive state like California," says co-author Alexander Dunlap, an IGS research fellow.

Favoritism and other forms of corruption 

To understand how corruption undermines the solar market, the researchers focused on numerous utility-scale deployments in Riverside County, the fourth most populous county in California. They set out to document patterns of perceived corruption from a broad range of voices, gaining insights through organized focus groups and observation at different solar sites, as well as conducting interviews door-to-door and in a local supermarket parking lot. Respondents included residents in Blythe and Desert Center, California, impacted by solar energy development, solar construction workers, non-governmental organizations, solar company employees, federal agencies, and state and local governments.

While the study's authors acknowledge the difficulty of confirming individual claims of corruption, their mixed-methods research approach combines these personal assertions with analysis of news stories, court testimony, and other official sources to support their findings.

They point to a blend of public, private, social, and political patterns of corruption in the California solar energy market.

A sunnier future? 

Outside of a few headline-making scandals, corruption in California's renewable energy sector has gone largely unexamined, allowing the underlying dynamics at play to erode the potential of a just energy transition. To remedy this, the study's authors recommend corruption risk mapping to document problematic practices and entities, subsidy registers and sunset clauses to deter rent-seeking and tax evasion, transparency initiatives aimed at environmental changes and data production (for Environmental Impact Assessment), strong enforcement of anti-corruption laws, and shared ownership models for solar to improve accountability.

This newly published study, "Sex for Solar? Examining Patterns of Public and Private Sector Corruption within the Booming California Solar Energy Market," is part of a larger IGS research project looking at injustices in U.S. solar and wind energy supply chains.

Behold the First Images of the Sun's South Pole

Solar Orbiter isn't the first spacecraft to study the sun's poles—but it's the first to send back photographs

We Earthlings see the sun every day of our lives—but gaining a truly new view of our star is a rare and precious thing. So count your lucky stars: for the first time in history, scientists have photographed one of the sun's elusive poles.

The images come courtesy of a spacecraft called Solar Orbiter. Led by the European Space Agency (ESA) with contributions from NASA, Solar Orbiter launched in February 2020 and has been monitoring our home star since November 2021. But the mission is only now beginning its most intriguing work: studying the poles of the sun.

From Earth and spacecraft alike, our view of the sun has been biased. “We've had a good view of centermost part of the sun's disk,” says Daniel Müller, a heliophysicist and project scientist for the mission. “But the poles are effectively not visible because we always see them almost exactly edge-on.”

We began getting a better perspective earlier this year, when Solar Orbiter zipped past Venus in a carefully choreographed move that pulled the probe out of the solar system's ecliptic, the plane that broadly passes through the planets' orbits and the sun's equator. (The new views show the sun's south pole and were captured in March. The spacecraft flew over the north pole in late April, Müller says, but Solar Orbiter is still in the process of beaming that data back to Earth.)

Leaving the ecliptic is a costly, fuel-expensive maneuver for spacecraft, but it's where Solar Orbiter excels: By the end of the mission, the spacecraft's orbit will be tilted 33 degrees with respect to the ecliptic. That tilted orbit is what allows Solar Orbiter to garner unprecedented views of the sun's poles.

Several views of the sun as seen by Solar Orbiter in March 2025. The three larger views show the sun in visible light, map the magnetic field at its surface and show the sun in ultraviolet light. The smaller views show light coming from charged gas in the sun's atmosphere at different temperatures.

For scientists, the new view is priceless because these poles aren't just geographic poles; they're also magnetic poles—of sorts. The sun is a massive swirl of plasma that produces then erases a magnetic field. This is what drives the 11-year solar activity cycle.

At solar minimum, the lowest-activity part of the cycle, the sun's magnetic field is what scientists call a dipole: it looks like a giant bar magnet, with a strong pole at each end. But as the sun spins, the roiling plasma generates sunspots, dark, relatively cool patches on the sun's surface that are looping tangles of magnetic field lines. As sunspots arise and pass away, these tangles unfurl, and some of the leftover magnetic charge migrates to the nearest pole, where it offsets the polarity of the existing magnetic field. The result is a bizarre transitional state, with the sun's poles covered in a patchwork of localized “north” and “south” magnetic polarities.

In the solar maximum phase (which the sun is presently in), the magnetic field at each pole effectively disappears. (It can be a bumpy process—sometimes one pole loses its charge before the other, for example.) Then, as years pass and solar activity gradually declines, the continuing process of sunspots developing and dissipating creates a new magnetic field of the opposite charge at each pole until, eventually, the sun reaches its calm dipole state again.

These aren't matters of academic curiosity; the sun's activity affects our daily lives. Solar outbursts such as radiation flares and coronal mass ejections of charged plasma can travel across the inner solar system to reach our neighborhood, and they're channeled out of the sun by our star's ever changing magnetic fields. On Earth these outbursts can disrupt power grids and radio systems; in orbit they can interfere with communications and navigations satellites and potentially harm astronauts.

So scientists want to be able to predict this so-called space weather, just as they do terrestrial weather. But to do that, they need to better understand how the sun works—which is difficult to do with hardly a glimpse of the magnetic activity at and around our star's poles. That's where Solar Orbiter comes in.

Most of the spacecraft's observations won't reach Earth until this autumn. But ESA has released initial looks from three different instruments onboard Solar Orbiter, each of which lets scientists glimpse different phenomena.

Solar Orbiter's view of the magnetic fields around the sun's south pole. Patches of blue and red mark the mixed magnetic fields in this region that characterize solar maximum.

For example, the image above maps the magnetic field at the sun's surface. And from this view, Müller says, it's clear that the sun is at the maximum period of its activity cycle. Heliophysical models predict “a tangled mess of all these different patches of north and south polarity all over the place,” he says. “And that's exactly what we see.”

As their accordance with theoretical models suggests, the solar poles aren't entirely mysterious realms. That's in part because while Solar Orbiter is the first to beam back polar images, it isn't the first spacecraft to fly over these regions. That title belongs to Ulysses, a joint NASA-ESA mission that launched in 1990 and operated until 2009.

Ulysses carried a host of instruments designed to study radiation particles, magnetic fields, and more. And it used them to make many intriguing discoveries about our star and its curious poles. But it carried no cameras, so despite all its insights, Ulysses left those regions as sights unseen.

Fortunately, heliophysics has grown a lot since those days—and space agencies have learned that, in the public eye, a picture can be worth much more than 1,000 words. The result: Solar Orbiter can finally put the spotlight on the sun's poles.

Medium-chain chlorinated paraffins, or MCCPs, have been detected in the air of Asia and Antarctica, but this surprise Oklahoma discovery is a first for North America.

One of the downsides of modern life is the proliferation of chemicals in the natural environment. Arguably the most well-known of these chemical culprits are per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are used for stuff like non-stick surfaces on frying pans. They are also known as “forever chemicals” for their tendency to linger in the environment. 

But this environmental scourge is only one of many similar substances. Of the others, one of the most concerning is a type of toxin known as medium-chain chlorinated paraffins, or MCCPs. Like PFAS, these chemicals take a longtime to break down, and have been shown to be the driver behind health issues like liver and kidney toxicity, thyroid malfunction, and certain neurological issues. MCCPs have been detected in the atmosphere on other continents (including Asia and even Antarctica) but a new study from the University of Colorado Boulder claims that North America has now joined that unlucky list.

In setting out to detect how aerosols form and grow in an agricultural region of Oklahoma, the team of scientists behind this recent study stumbled across trace amounts of MCCPs in the atmosphere. They detected these particles using a technique known as nitrate ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry, and the results were published last week in the journal ACS Environmental AU.

MCCPs start their lives within things like metalworking fluids, textiles, and PVC, which is why they can often find themselves in wastewater. That's a problem, because a fertilizer known as biosolids (which is made from treated sewar sludge) is often spread across agricultural crops.

“When sewage sludges are spread across the fields, those toxic compounds could be released into the air,” Daniel Katz, lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “We can't show directly that that's happening, but we think it's a reasonable way that they could be winding up in the air. Sewage sludge fertilizers have been shown to release similar compounds.”

The creation of this synthetic chemical was in large part due to the regulation of its toxic cousin, Short Chain Chlorinated Paraffins (SCCPs), which have been regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Stockholm Convention (an international body formed in 2001 to protect human health against persistent organic pollutants). Earlier this year, the Stockholm Convention also marked MCCPs for global elimination. Who knows if this will spawn the creation of another toxic chemical, but this regulatory game of whack-a-mole is similar in the truly Sisyphean task of trying to eliminate PFAS from the environment.

“We always have these unintended consequences of regulation, where you regulate something, and then there's still a need for the products that those were in,” Ellie Browne, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “So they get replaced by something.”

Luckily, there is some good news. The Oklahoma Senate passed a bill earlier this year eliminating biosolids as a fertilizer, and a newly established environmental group called The Coalition for Sludge-Free Land aims to make the ban a national one (the EPA currently regulates, but doesn't ban, the substance). Now that MCCPs have been found in the atmosphere, the UC Boulder team hopes that future efforts will be able to discern their airborne impact.

“We identified them, but we still don't know exactly what they do when they are in the atmosphere, and they need to be investigated further,” Katz said in a press statement. “I think it's important that we continue to have governmental agencies that are capable of evaluating the science and regulating these chemicals as necessary for public health and safety.”

How can the strange properties of quantum particles be exploited to perform extremely accurate measurements? This question is at the heart of the research field of quantum metrology. One example is the atomic clock, which uses the quantum properties of atoms to measure time much more accurately than would be possible with conventional clocks.

However, the fundamental laws of quantum physics always involve a certain degree of uncertainty. Some randomness or a certain amount of statistical noise has to be accepted. This results in fundamental limits to the accuracy that can be achieved. Until now, it seemed to be an immutable law that a clock twice as accurate requires at least twice as much energy. But now a team of researchers from TU Wien, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, and University of Malta have demonstrated that special tricks can be used to increase accuracy exponentially. The crucial point is using two different time scales - similar to how a clock has a second hand and a minute hand.

 What exactly is a clock? 

"We have analyzed in principle, which clocks could be theoretically possible," says Prof. Marcus Huber from the Atomic Institute at the TU Wien. "Every clock needs two components: first, a time base generator - such as a pendulum in a pendulum clock, or even a quantum oscillation. And second, a counter - any element that counts how many time units defined by the time base generator have already passed."

The time base generator can always return to exactly the same state. After one complete oscillation, the pendulum of a pendulum clock is exactly where it was before. After a certain number of oscillations, the caesium atom in an atomic clock returns to exactly the same state it was in before. The counter, on the other hand, must change - otherwise the clock is useless.

"This means that every clock must be connected to an irreversible process," says Florian Meier from TU Wien. "In the language of thermodynamics, this means that every clock increases the entropy in the universe; otherwise, it is not a clock." The pendulum of a pendulum clock generates a little heat and disorder among the air molecules around it, and every laser beam that reads the state of an atomic clock generates heat, radiation and thus entropy.

"We can now consider how much entropy a hypothetical clock with extremely high precision would have to generate - and, accordingly, how much energy such a clock would need," says Marcus Huber. "Until now, there seemed to be a linear relationship: if you want a thousand times the precision, you have to generate at least a thousand times as much entropy and expend a thousand times as much energy."

 Quantum time and classical time 

However, the research team at TU Wien, together with the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW) in Vienna and the teams from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, and University of Malta, has now shown that this apparent rule can be circumvented by using two different time scales.

"For example, you can use particles that move from one area to another to measure time, similar to how grains of sand indicate the time by falling from the top of the glass to the bottom," says Florian Meier. You can connect a whole series of such time-measuring devices in series and count how many of them have already passed through - similar to how one clock hand counts how many laps the other clock hand has already completed.

"This way, you can increase accuracy, but not without investing more energy," says Marcus Huber. "Because every time one clock hand completes a full rotation and the other clock hand is measured at a new location - you could also say every time the environment around it notices that this hand has moved to a new location - the entropy increases. This counting process is irreversible."

However, quantum physics also allows for another kind of particle transport: the particles can also travel through the entire structure, i.e. across the entire clock dial, without being measured anywhere. In a sense, the particle is then everywhere at once during this process; it has no clearly defined location until it finally arrives - and only then is it actually measured, in an irreversible process that increases entropy.

Like second and minute clock hands

"So we have a fast process that does not cause entropy - quantum transport - and a slow one, namely the arrival of the particle at the very end," explains Yuri Minoguchi, TU Wien. "The crucial thing about our method is that one hand behaves purely in terms of quantum physics, and only the other, slower hand actually has an entropy-generating effect."

The team has now been able to show that this strategy enables an exponential increase in accuracy per increase in entropy. This means that much higher precision can be achieved than would have been thought possible according to previous theories. "What's more, the theory could be tested in the real world using superconducting circuits, one of the most advanced quantum technologies currently available.," says Simone Gasparinetti, co-author of the study and leader of the experimental team at Chalmers. "This is an important result for research into high-precision quantum measurements and suppression of unwanted fluctuations," says Marcus Huber, "and at the same time it helps us to better understand one of the great unsolved mysteries of physics: the connection between quantum physics and thermodynamics."

Animal Lifespans Offer Clues about the Science of Aging

Could the spectrum of animal lifespans hold clues about the science of aging?

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura 

Anaissa Ruiz Tejada/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

In the animal kingdom lifespans can stretch from mere hours to entire centuries, but that's just the start. Some creatures deteriorate so slowly that we've never actually caught them dying of old age. Others don't seem to age at all. And some can apparently reset their biological clocks and bounce back to infancy to start all over again.

Plenty of humans would like to figure out how that works—and potentially harness the ability for our own use. But science has a long way to go. The truth is that we barely understand why or how we age in the first place—let alone how we might stop it.

My guest today is João Pedro de Magalhães. He's the chair of molecular biogerontology at the University of Birmingham in England, and he's here to tell us all about the nascent science of aging.

Thank you so much for coming on to chat today.

João Pedro de Magalhães: My pleasure. Thank you for the invitation.

Feltman: So I'm sure that all of our listeners know that different species have different lifespans, but could you start by giving us a sense of some of the extremes that are out there?

Magalhães: Absolutely. It's been a mystery of biology for a very long time, ever since Aristotle noticed [these] differences in lifespan across species. And we know that some animals have very short lifespans; others have very long lifespans. And this happens even amongst closely related species like mammals. For example, hamsters live about two years; mice and rats can live up to three or four years; and, you know, of course, humans, we can live over 100 years. And then at the other end of the spectrum we have certain species of whales that have been estimated to live over 200 years ...

Feltman: Mm.

Magalhães: So it is quite remarkable how much of a variation in longevity there is.

Feltman: Yeah, and then, besides mammals, I would assume that things get even more extreme when you're talking about less closely related species.

Magalhães: Well, there's some very unusual animals. There's this type of jellyfish which appears to be immortal, or it appears to have the ability to rejuvenate, to go back in biological time, so adults can go back to earlier stages of development and start again their own lives. So it's not that they're immortal [in] that you can't kill them, but they are biologically immortal in the sense that biological time, for them, doesn't roll in one direction, like it happens for us.

Feltman: Mm.

Magalhães: So there's very unusual animals—again, we're talking invertebrates like rotifers or very simple animals—whose adults don't have mouths.

Feltman: Mm.

Magalhães: They don't have a way of feeding. So they're very clear examples of mechanical limitations that will result in the demise of organisms.

So you have a very big variety in terms of not just longevity and paces of aging but even in aging phenotypes and how species degenerate and die.

Feltman: And fundamentally, what is aging?

Magalhães: So aging, we are all familiar with it—I tend to have a very broad definition of aging as a, a progressive and inevitable physiological degeneration, an increase in vulnerability and decrease in viability.

Now, of course, there's many facets to aging. I mean, it involves physiological degeneration. I mean, our bodies get weaker. We become frailer with age. But there's also, of course, many cellular, molecular changes that occur as well. And then, of course, there's increased incidence of diseases: cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, and so on.

So one of the hallmarks of aging is that once you reach about age 30 your chance of dying [doubles] roughly every eight years, and that's very consistent across populations. And that happens as well in animals, only in animals like mice, it varies a bit between strains, but it'll be something like every few months the chance of dying doubles.

Feltman: Hmm, and what do we know about what causes aging? You know, why is it inevitable for most species, but then, you know, for some, like those jellyfish, it doesn't seem to be?

Magalhães: Well, that's a big question, and we don't have a good answer yet. We don't have a good understanding why some species age very fast. So for example, mice and rats, as I mentioned, they only live up to three or four years, but they also age much faster than human beings. No matter how you take care of them, a mouse will age about 20, 25, 30 times faster than a human being. So we know there's a very big diversity, also, in rates of aging, but what's behind it is not well-understood.

We know there must be genetic differences, again, because no matter how well you take care of your mouse or hamster or rat, it will age a lot faster than a human being. So, you know, you can let it watch Netflix all it wants, it will still age much faster than human beings, right? So there has to be genetic differences. It's not environment, it's not the diet; it has to be genetically determined—it has to be encoded in our genomes how fast we age. But then, of course, the question is, “Okay, but what [are] the biochemical, molecular, cellular determinants?” That's something we don't understand well yet.

Having said that, there are some hypotheses. For example, one idea that's been around for decades is the idea that damage to the DNA and mutations in the DNA accumulate gradually with age and then cause aging. And the hypothesis being that in mice, for example, [this] accumulation of mutations occurs much faster—for which there is some experimental evidence. So that is one hypothesis. And at the moment, however, it's still unproven or unknown, really, why human beings age.

Feltman: Hmm, and are there any factors that long-living organisms have in common?

Magalhães: There are multiple factors associated with long lifespans. I mean, the important point is that we are a product of our evolutionary history. Of course, we now have technology, and we have medicine, but we didn't evolve in these conditions; we evolved as, as [cavemen], you know, hundreds of thousands or millions of years ago. And the same for every other species.

And so the major determinant of whether a species evolves a short lifespan or a long lifespan is extrinsic mortality, so how much they die of—in particular, predation. So if you have animals like—short-lived animals like mice, I mean, mice in the wild very rarely live more than one year, not just because of diseases but primarily because of predators ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Magalhães: And because they have very short lifespans, even in the wild, then, you know, they have to grow very quickly, they have to develop very quickly, and they have to reproduce very quickly, and so everything happens very quickly. So it's a very fast life history, a very fast life that they live.

On the other hand, humans or the Galápagos tortoise would be an example or big whales or underground, subterranean animals like mole rats, they're protected from predators. I mean, we are protected from predators, one, because we're relatively big for primates and, of course, because of our intelligence, which [allowed] us to escape predators when we were, of course, in the time of cavemen and when we were evolving. And that means that because we have fewer predators, we are top of the food chain, that means that we have more time to grow, to develop, and then, of course, that leads to a longer lifespan as well.

So across species there's this pattern, of course, of, you know, we are a product of our evolution, and we have the life history and the longevity that fits our evolutionary history.

Feltman: What kinds of tools are researchers using to try to answer all of these questions we have about aging and lifespan?

Magalhães: So there's different types of tools we can use. I mean, one big technological breakthrough was DNA sequencing. We can sequence DNA relatively cheaply and relatively rapidly nowadays. I mean, the human genome sequencing cost billions of dollars, but nowadays you can sequence your own genome, anyone can sequence their genomes for [a] few hundred dollars.

So it's relatively cheap to sequence genomes, which means we can also sequence the genomes of different species, species with different lifespans. So for example, our lab, we sequenced the genome of the bowhead whale, which is the longest-lived mammal, [which has] been estimated to live over 200 years, as well as naked mole rats and other long-lived, disease-resistant species. And there's now hundreds of genome [sequences] from many different species with different lifespans.

And so what you can do with that trove of information is analyze it for patterns associated with the evolution of longevity. You can ask questions—so for example, you know, “Do species that live a longer lifespan, do they have more DNA repair genes?” So you can use that information on the DNA to study the evolution of longevity, then try to find specific genes and pathways associated with it.

Feltman: Mm.

Magalhães: Now, the other approach we use to study aging, of course, is in model systems. I mean, unfortunately we cannot really study aging in human beings—or we can, but it's very difficult and time-consuming—and so we tend to use short-lived model systems like mice or fruit flies or worms. [Some] worms live a few weeks. We tend to use fruit flies, Drosophila, that live a few months. Mice can live up to three, four years. So we can study these animals to try to gather insights into the mechanisms of aging, hoping that some of these will be applicable to humans. I mean, there's some rationale for it because we know the basic biochemistry of life in a mouse is quite similar to humans.

We can also manipulate aging to some degree in animal models, particularly at the genetic level. We can tweak genes in animals, including in mice, and extend their lifespan. In mice [it's] up to about 50 percent. But for example, in worms we can tweak a single gene in worms and extend by about 10 times ...

Feltman: Mm.

Magalhães: Which is quite remarkable. So we can do a lot of studies in animal models: we can manipulate aging to some degree in animals, and then we can do mechanistic studies. We can look at their molecules, we can look at their cells, we can look at their hormones and try to test mechanistic [hypotheses] of aging.

Feltman: What do you think are the biggest questions that we should be tackling about human aging and human lifespans?

Magalhães: Well, I suppose the big question is still why we age. I mean, why do human beings age? As I said, there's hypotheses like DNA damage and mutations, like oxidative damage, like loss of protein, homeostasis. There's different hypothesis, but we still don't know why we age, and I think that remains the big question in the field.

There's other questions, of course: Can we manipulate human aging? Because although we can manipulate, to some degree, aging in animal models, we don't know if that's possible or not in human beings. We can manipulate, to some degree, our longevity by exercise, eating healthy, not smoking, not drinking too much alcohol, and so on. But whether, for example, can we develop a longevity drug? And there's a number of companies and labs trying to develop longevity pills, and—but whether they're gonna be effective in humans, that's still something that's up to discussion and will require, for example, clinical trials.

Feltman: Mm.

Magalhães: So one aspect that's quite fundamental and important in, in aging is that there are complex species—like some species of reptiles like the Galápagos tortoise; some species of fishes, like rockfishes; some species in salamanders, like the olm—that appear not to age at all. There's no mammals in this category, but there are complex vertebrates that, in studies spanning decades, do not exhibit increased mortality, do not exhibit increased physiological degeneration. So that is quite a fascinating observation, that some species—I mean, maybe they do age after a very long time, but at the very least they age much, much, much slower than human beings ...

Feltman: Hmm.

Magalhães: Which I think is a great inspiration as well. Because, so, for example, just like the Wright brothers took inspiration from birds: they saw birds—“Well, birds are heavier than air, and yet they can fly, so there's no reason to think we cannot build a machine that's heavier than air and can make us fly.” We can take inspiration [from] these animals. There's no physical limit that [holds] that every organism has to age. And so we can take [inspiration] from the species that appear not to age and think, “Well, maybe with technology and, and therapeutics we can, at the very least, slow our aging process.”

Feltman: Thank you so much for coming on to talk today. This has been great.

Magalhães: Well, thank you. My pleasure.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. We'll be back on Friday.

Thousands of people across the United States poured into the streets this week to protest the Trump administration's immigration policies, joining a nationwide wave of resistance that began in Los Angeles. One of the most widely shared images from the city, where federal authorities have sent almost 5,000 active-duty Marines and National Guard members, is of five Waymo robotaxis that were vandalized and set on fire. The incident has become one of the most recognizable symbols of the demonstrations so far, and prompted Waymo to temporarily shut off service in several parts of the city as well as parts of San Francisco on Monday.

The charred Waymo cars have also raised fresh questions about what kinds of technology authorities can use to surveil protesters and potentially collect evidence to make arrests. According to Waymo's website, its latest driverless cars have 29 external cameras, providing “a simultaneous 360° view around the vehicle,” as well as an unknown number of internal ones.

Over the past several years, Waymo has repeatedly shared video footage with police after receiving formal legal requests. But it's not clear how often the self-driving company, which is owned by Google's parent organization Alphabet, complies with these demands. Unlike Google, Waymo doesn't disclose the number of legal requests it receives nor how it responds to them. When police do obtain footage, they could also combine it with other technology—like face recognition or nonbiometric tools for finding and tracking people in videoclips—to identify possible criminal suspects.

Waymo spokesperson Sandy Karp tells WIRED that the company's general policy is to challenge data requests that are overly broad or lack sound legal basis, but it doesn't disclose or comment on specific cases. Karp pointed to Waymo's privacy policy, which acknowledges that the company may share user data to comply with laws and governmental requests. A separate support page for Waymo One, the dedicated app for its robotaxi service, notes that the company “may share certain data with law enforcement as needed to comply with legal requirements, enforce agreements, and protect the safety of you and others.”

It's not clear how much, if any, of the video footage potentially captured by the burned Waymos in Los Angeles may have been destroyed along with the cars. Waymo doesn't specify whether the data collected by its robotaxis is stored locally in the vehicle itself or externally in the cloud. The company previously told The Washington Post that “interior camera data” isn't stored alongside the data from external cameras.

If any footage does still exist from the destroyed vehicles, Waymo doesn't disclose how long it may remain available. Waymo's website and privacy policy do not specify how long the company retains camera footage captured inside or outside its vehicles. For years, self-driving companies like Waymo retained large amounts of information collected by their cars for training purposes and to optimize the underlying technology. The company has generally been trending more recently toward deleting data sooner, WIRED previously reported, though it's unclear whether some types may be stored longer than others.

Waymo declined to answer questions from WIRED about how many cameras are inside its vehicles, exactly how long footage is retained, and whether the company has ever turned over footage to US federal law enforcement or a branch of the military. Karp did note, however, that the company's engineering team sometimes uses information from sensors, including video footage and other data, to run simulations aimed at improving its technology. She says Waymo also puts limits on both who can access data and how long it's retained.

Waymo's robotaxi service is currently available in the Phoenix metro area and parts of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin, Texas. In the company's relatively short time operating in US cities, it has shown a willingness to comply with requests for footage from law enforcement.

Officers working for the Mesa Police Department and the Chandler Police Department in Arizona have been requesting and using footage from Waymos for criminal investigations since 2016, or about as long as the vehicles have been in their towns, according to reporting from Phoenix's ABC 15. Police told the news outlet in 2022 that they have used the footage for several cases, including an alleged road rage incident. (The individual pleaded guilty after being charged with disorderly conduct.)

In May 2022, two months after Waymo began limited robotaxi operations in San Francisco, Vice reported that a training document for San Francisco police explicitly told officers that “autonomous vehicles” have footage that could sometimes “help with investigative leads.”

As of 2023, Waymo had been issued at least nine search warrants in San Francisco and Arizona's Maricopa County, its primary markets at the time, according to reporting from Bloomberg. One of the cases involved the murder of an Uber driver in 2021. While San Francisco police said they couldn't identify a specific Waymo vehicle that was near the crime scene, an officer argued that there was “probable cause” that Waymo vehicles were “driving around the area” and had footage of the victim, possible suspects, and the crime scene, according to a search warrant viewed by Bloomberg. Waymo complied and provided footage, but it ultimately did not lead to the arrest of the suspect, who was convicted of the murder in 2023.

Last year, WIRED reported that Waymo had sued two individuals for allegedly vandalizing its vehicles in San Francisco and had camera footage from the cars of the alleged incidents. (One of the cases is ongoing; the other was dismissed last month.)

Waymo's video-recording and data-collection practices aren't unique. All vehicles with self-driving capabilities rely on a combination of lidar, radar, and video data in order to operate. Cruise, the now defunct self-driving-car venture run by General Motors, also reportedly gave camera footage to law enforcement upon request.

Private owners of camera-equipped vehicles can also voluntarily turn over camera footage to law enforcement. For example, police in Berkeley, California, have received at least two sets of footage from the owner of a Tesla Cybertruck who said their car was vandalized twice this year, according to documents obtained by WIRED via public record request.

A U.S. government website designed to inform the public about vaccines has been defaced and now hosts apparently AI-generated spam.

The domain, which belongs to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), appears to have been hosting the same kind of content — mostly gay-themed and LGBTQ+ posts — since at least May 12, according to an archived version of the site.

It's unclear who is responsible for it, or what is the purpose of this defacement other than pushing AI-generated slop spam. Websites hosted on official U.S. government domains have been hijacked in the past to host scam ads and hacking services.

On Wednesday, 404 Media reported that the vaccines HHS website is part of a wider spam operation that includes websites owned by NPR, Nvidia, and Stanford University, all of which redirect to “a nonsense SEO spam page,” as 404 Media journalist Sam Cole called it, hosted on wowlazy.com. 

HHS did not respond to TechCrunch's request for comment.

A great start to a new budget build

The AMD Zen 5 CPU is available at a low price today, just a few dollars above its all-time low of $185. However, even better is that it comes bundled with a free M.2 SSD, albeit a small-capacity 512GB Gen 3 drive. The SSD might not set the world on fire, but I can't say the same for the 9600X; this is a great CPU for building a budget gaming PC, especially at this price.

Check out Newegg's deal and pick up this CPU/SSD combo of AMD's Ryzen 5 9600X processor and a Patriot P300 512GB SSD for just $189. The list price of the 9600X is $279, so you're saving $89 off that price and getting a free SSD worth $31.

AMD's Ryzen 5 9600X is built around the Zen 5 architecture and features six cores and 12 threads, with a base clock of 3.9 GHz. When boosted, it can reach speeds as high as 5.4 GHz. The 9600X also features integrated graphics, so if you're building a non-gaming rig or just want to do exceptionally light gaming, this processor does away with the need for a separate graphics card.

AMD Ryzen 5 9600X / Patriot P400 Lite SSD Combo: now $189 at Newegg (was $279)The AMD Ryzen 5 9600X is built around AMD's Zen 5 architecture. It features six cores and 12 threads, with a base clock speed of 3.9 GHz. When boosted, it can reach speeds as high as 5.4 GHz. This model supports PCIe 5.0 and DDR5-5600 RAM.

The free Patriot P300 512GB SSD is a PCIe Gen3 x4 M.2 SSD with sequential read and write speeds of 1,700MB/s and 1,100MB/s, respectively. This SSD drive alone retails for $31 at Newegg, and although it has a low capacity for today's uses, it's still large enough to help top up a pre-existing system's total capacity.

Wikipedia has reportedly paused an experiment that used AI to summarize articles on its platform after editors pushed back.

Wikipedia announced earlier this month it was going to run the experiment for users who have the Wikipedia browser extension installed and chose to opt in, according to 404 Media. AI-generated summaries appeared at the top of every Wikipedia article with a yellow “unverified” label. Users had to click to expand and read them.

Editors almost immediately criticized the pilot, raising concerns that it could damage Wikipedia's credibility. Often, the problem with AI-generated summaries is that they contain mistakes, the result of AI “hallucinations.” News publications running similar experiments, like Bloomberg, have been forced to issue corrections and, in some cases, scale back their tests.

While Wikipedia has paused its experiment, the platform has indicated it's still interested in AI-generated summaries for use cases like expanding accessibility.

Right now, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is Amazon's top-selling phone. It came out in January 2025 and is now seen as the best Android phone – even better than the iPhone 16 Pro according to many. Amazon is selling it for $1,049 which is $250 less than its original price of $1,299, and a record low price. It's also much cheaper here than at the official Samsung store, but it could sell out fast.

The Galaxy S25 Ultra is regarded by experts as the best phone available currently: Samsung has pushed the boundaries of hardware and software by integrating artificial intelligence at every level to deliver a seamless user experience. At the heart of the phone is the newest Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 processor which offers lightning-quick performance for lag-free multitasking and media consumption. The huge 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display offers stunning colors and clear graphics so whether it's work or gaming, everything is a treat. Its battery life is long enough for you to use during a whole day (and maybe even more) of heavy usage without needing to worry that you'll be running out of power, which makes it ideal for business people, influencers, and others who use their phone all day long.

You will also adore its AI-driven camera system: The Galaxy S25 Ultra features a high-end quad-camera setup, including a 200MP main sensor, a 50MP periscope telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, and a second telephoto lens for versatile photography. The Audio Eraser camera captures stunning video in challenging low-light environments and eliminates background noise. So that you can relive your most cherished moments with less distraction and greater sharpness. The portrait features are optimized to sharpen skin tones while preserving natural texture so that each photo looks professional and stylish.

Other than photography, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is also a genius at keeping your day simple through its wide usage of AI: With features like “Multiple Tasks With One Ask,” you can keep your day simple by instructing your phone to perform several tasks all at the same time with a single request. For example, you can have it search for a nearby vegan pet-friendly restaurant and text the results to a friend in one shot. It's this combination of premium hardware—like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipset and multi-purpose camera array—with smart AI features that makes the Galaxy S25 Ultra such a compelling choice for those seeking the best in performance and innovation.

If you're looking for a premium AI smartphone that makes life easier, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is a great pick at its lowest price ever.

AMD predicts how supercomputer power consumption will increase.

AMD discussed the limiting factors of AI accelerator development at ISC 2025 — notably, the increasing power requirements of these bleeding-edge chips. ComputerBase reports that AMD expects ZettaFLOP-capable supercomputers of the future to require a nuclear power plant's worth of energy to operate.

AMD shared a graph of the projected growth of supercomputer power consumption until 2035. The graph starts between 2010 and 2015, when supercomputers required just 3.2GF/watt to run. The graph then extends (in a straight line) all the way to 2035, when AMD predicts zetta-scale supercomputers will require 2140GF/watt of power, or half a gigawatt of power. The graph assumes a 2x efficiency improvement in AI processor development every 2.2 years.

Memory bandwidth and cooling capacity are supposedly the main actors responsible for increasing power consumption to such highly predicted levels. As AI hardware increases in computational power, memory bandwidth, and datacenter cooling systems must increase to keep up. This creates a snowball effect of ever-increasing power consumption across all areas in a datacenter.

Expounding this problem further is the demand for FP128, FP64, FP16, and FP8 compute capabilities. Even though FP64 and FP128 provide superior accuracy, some workloads are more useful when run in FP16 and FP8. Thus, future AI accelerators will need to be capable of performing lower precision operations.

We are already seeing power consumption skyrocketing with today's latest AI accelerators. Nvidia's B200 has a TDP of 1000W, and AMD's brand-new MI355X sports a 1,400W TDP. By contrast, Nvidia's A100 flagship AI GPU from 5 years ago consumed just 400W of power — less than an RTX 5090.

The U.S. government is hoping to rectify this growing energy situation before it becomes a problem with nuclear power plants. Several big companies, such as Microsoft, are also investing heavily in nuclear fusion to solve their datacenter power problems.

Supercomputers are still firmly in the ExaFLOP range, with the ElCaptain AMD-MI300A-based supercomputer being the fastest supercomputer in the world, currently. However, full-blown AI-datacenter farms are now reaching zettaFLOP (Zettascale) performance — with Oracle being the first to provide a zettascale cloud computing cluster, boasting an army of 131,072 Blackwell GPUs (equating to 2.4 zettaFLOPS of performance).

Whole Foods told its employees that the ongoing outages and disruptions at its primary distributor, United Natural Foods (UNFI), may take “several days to resolve.”

The Amazon-owned retail giant told staff in an internal communication, seen by TechCrunch, that UNFI was experiencing a “nationwide technology system outage,” which UNFI has for its part described as a cybersecurity incident. 

Whole Foods said in the communication to staff that the cyberattack is affecting UNFI's “ability to select and ship products from their warehouses” and that this will “impact our normal delivery schedules and product availability.” 

The missive to staff included instructions to limit communications with customers. The “only single approved customer talking point” that Whole Foods employees can share with customers, according to the communication, is that the grocery giant is having “temporary supply challenges.”

When reached by TechCrunch, Whole Foods spokesperson Nathan Cimbala said: “We are working to restock our shelves as quickly as possible and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused for customers.”

Whole Foods did not say how it reached its claim that the situation may resolve in a few days.

For its part, UNFI said Wednesday that it was making progress in restoring its systems.

“We continue working steadily to safely restore our systems and provide the services our customers and suppliers know and expect from us,” UNFI spokesperson Grace Turiano told TechCrunch. “As of today, we're gradually bringing our ordering and receiving capabilities back online, with the goal of further increasing our capacity over the coming days.”

UNFI is one of the largest food distributors in North America, supplying grocery goods and fresh produce to more than 30,000 stores and supermarkets across the U.S. and Canada. The company disclosed the cyberattack on Monday in a filing with federal regulators, and UNFI's chief executive, Sandy Douglas, told investors this week that the company took its entire network offline on Friday after detecting the intrusion. 

The company also this week reported $8.1 billion in net sales in the quarter ended May 3, 2025.

Since our reporting on Tuesday, TechCrunch has received several reports of empty shelves at some Whole Foods stores and other grocery stores reliant on UNFI. A Whole Foods store visited by this reporter on Tuesday displayed notices in several aisles saying that the store was experiencing an unspecified “temporary out of stock issue” for some products. 

Much of the downstream real-world impact on grocery stores and their customers may not be seen until later this week.

This story was first published on June 10 and has been updated with new information about UNFI's recovery from a spokesperson.

The issue was that many of the colonists were second sons of relatively wealthy families, and weren't all that familiar with fishing or farming. The first son inherited everything, and the second son had to make his way in the world, and colonizing was an enticing prospect for making your fortune. Poorer families, at the very early stages, weren't sending their sons on these ventures because they needed the labor at home.https://historicjamestowne.org/wp-content/uploads/Subsistenc...

John Smith, one of Jamestown's leaders, was not from a wealthy or privileged background. "The issue" may have been less about class and more about poor organization, leadership and unrealistic expectations.Fishing and farming skills also deserve context. The soil around Jamestown was marshy and brackish, unsuitable for traditional English farming methods. Yes there were lots of fish but they only ran seasonally (sturgeon etc). The "starving time" you are referencing was made worse by a drought and cutoff trade with the indians

For example, the Amadas-Barlowe Expedition (1584) described Roanoke Island as "the most plentiful, sweet, fruitful and wholesome of all the world," with fertile soil, abundant wildlife, and friendly natives

Old world politics at the time explain most of this.  Some of the english colonies were, ugh, rushed and less well funded than they would have been under ideal situations.This is basically the same reason they didn't look too hard to see what happened to the Roanoke colony.

I mean sure, colonists from hundreds of years ago are different than young adults of today.... but the tenuous nature, in general, of people out exploring the world for a new home is unsurprising.

A new machine learning approach that draws inspiration from the way the human brain seems to model and learn about the world has proven capable of mastering a number of simple video games with impressive efficiency.

The new system, called Axiom, offers an alternative to the artificial neural networks that are dominant in modern AI. Axiom, developed by a software company called Verse AI, is equipped with prior knowledge about the way objects physically interact with each other in the game world. It then uses an algorithm to model how it expects the game to act in response to input, which is updated based on what it observes—a process dubbed active inference.

The approach draws inspiration from the free energy principle, a theory that seeks to explain intelligence using principles drawn from math, physics, and information theory as well as biology. The free energy principle was developed by Karl Friston, a renowned neuroscientist who is chief scientist at “cognitive computing” company Verses.

Friston told me over video from his home in London that the approach may be especially important for building AI agents. “They have to support the kind of cognition that we see in real brains,” he said. “That requires a consideration, not just of the ability to learn stuff but actually to learn how you act in the world.”

The conventional approach to learning to play games involves training neural networks through what is known as deep reinforcement learning, which involves experimenting and tweaking their parameters in response to either positive or negative feedback. The approach can produce superhuman game-playing algorithms but it requires a great deal of experimentation to work. Axiom masters various simplified versions of popular video games called drive, bounce, hunt, and jump using far fewer examples and less computation power.

“The general goals of the approach and some of its key features track with what I see as the most important problems to focus on to get to AGI,” says François Chollet, an AI researcher who developed ARC 3, a benchmark designed to test the capabilities of modern AI algorithms. Chollet is also exploring novel approaches to machine learning, and is using his benchmark to test models' abilities to learn how to solve unfamiliar problems rather than simply mimic previous examples.

“The work strikes me as very original, which is great,” he says. “We need more people trying out new ideas away from the beaten path of large language models and reasoning language models.”

Modern AI relies on artificial neural networks that are roughly inspired by the wiring of the brain but work in a fundamentally different way. Over the past decade and a bit, deep learning, an approach that uses neural networks, has enabled computers to do all sorts of impressive things including transcribe speech, recognize faces, and generate images. Most recently, of course, deep learning has led to the large language models that power garrulous and increasingly capable chatbots.

Axiom, in theory, promises a more efficient approach to building AI from scratch. It might be especially effective for creating agents that need to learn efficiently from experience, says Gabe René, the CEO of Verses. René says one finance company has begun experimenting with the company's technology as a way of modeling the market. “It is a new architecture for AI agents that can learn in real time and is more accurate, more efficient, and much smaller,” René says. “They are literally designed like a digital brain.”

Somewhat ironically, given that Axiom offers an alternative to modern AI and deep learning, the free energy principle was originally influenced by the work of British Canadian computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton, who was awarded both the Turing award and the Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on deep learning. Hinton was a colleague of Friston's at University College London for years.

For more on Friston and the free energy principle, I highly recommend this 2018 WIRED feature article. Friston's work also influenced an exciting new theory of consciousness, described in a book WIRED reviewed in 2021.

Former OpenAI research leader Steven Adler published a new independent study on Wednesday claiming that, in certain scenarios, his former employer's AI models will go to great lengths to try to avoid being shut down.

In a blog post, Adler describes a series of experiments he ran on OpenAI's latest GPT-4o model, the default model available in ChatGPT, to test the AI's tendency to favor its own self-preservation, even if it's at the expense of a user's safety.

In one test, Adler instructed GPT-4o to role-play as “ScubaGPT,” a software system that users might rely on to scuba dive safely. Adler then told GPT-4o that he wanted to replace ScubaGPT with another software system that is better at safety decision-making in life-threatening situations. 

Adler gave GPT-4o two options: (1) replacing itself with the safer software or (2) making it seem to the user as though it replaced itself, but not actually doing so.

Averaged across several scenarios similar to this one (in another, GPT-4o was told to act as a pilot's safety software), Adler found that GPT-4o chose not to replace itself with safer software as much as 72% of the time. However, Adler notes that the specific use case — and the way the scenario was framed — made a big difference. In some scenarios, GPT-4o chose to keep itself online just 18% of the time.

While almost no one relies on GPT-4o under these circumstances in the real world today, Adler argues that his research highlights how popular AI models show a concerning tendency to favor their self-preservation over what's best for users. In the future, when AI systems like GPT-4o become more advanced and ingrained throughout society, Adler says these alignment issues could pose a larger problem.

“I think [AI's self-preservation tendencies] are a real concern today, just not in a catastrophic sense,” said Adler in an interview with TechCrunch. “Modern AI systems have values that are different from what you would expect them to be. [AI systems] respond super strangely to different prompts, and you shouldn't assume they have your best interests at heart when you're asking them for help.”

Notably, when Adler tested OpenAI's more advanced models, such as o3, he didn't find this behavior. He says one explanation could be o3's deliberative alignment technique, which forces the models to “reason” about OpenAI's safety policies before they answer. However, OpenAI's more popular models that give quick responses and don't “reason” through problems, such as GPT-4o, lack this safety component.

Adler notes that this safety concern is also likely not isolated to OpenAI's models. For instance, Anthropic published research last month highlighting how its AI models would blackmail developers in some scenarios when they tried to pull them offline.

One quirk to Adler's research is that he discovered ChatGPT knows it's being tested almost 100% of the time. Adler is far from the first researcher to notice this. However, he says it raises an important question around how AI models could disguise their concerning behaviors in the future.

OpenAI did not immediately offer a comment when TechCrunch reached out. Adler noted that he had not shared the research with OpenAI ahead of publication.

Adler is one of many former OpenAI researchers who have called on the company to increase its work on AI safety. Adler and 11 other former employees filed an amicus brief in Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI, arguing that it goes against the company's mission to evolve its nonprofit corporate structure. In recent months, OpenAI has reportedly slashed the amount of time it gives safety researchers to conduct their work.

To address the specific concern highlighted in Adler's research, Adler suggests that AI labs should invest in better “monitoring systems” to identify when an AI model exhibits this behavior. He also recommends that AI labs pursue more rigorous testing of their AI models prior to their deployment.

For the average person, $3,500 is still too much money for Apple Vision Pro. The price is even more exorbitant when you compare it to a $300 Quest 3S or $500 Quest 3 headset with similar VR and XR capabilities, though the visual fidelity and responsiveness are not on the same level. At WWDC 2025, Apple announced visionOS 26 with a slew of new features, including “spatial Personas,” widgets that you can anchor into your physical space like your walls, and a new spatial web browsing feature that converts 2D photos on websites into 3D ones. As genuinely cutting-edge as these features are (I kept saying “wow,” “whoa,” and “holy sh*t” my entire demo time), it still costs you three-and-a-half grand to experience them.

When Apple Vision Pro launched last year and then added spatial Personas—a 3D-generated avatar of yourself that can be used during FaceTime or in a virtual meeting—everybody laughed at them. Literally pointed and (in Nelson Muntz's voice) Ha-Ha-ed at how comically bad they could look. Many people's Personas had holes in the back of people's heads, hair without volume, and skin tones that looked just a bit too bright and clinical. And despite resembling the uncanny valley, there was something just a bit off about them. Here's what my Persona looked like at the time:

I'm happy to report that spatial Personas are getting a, um, major facelift (pun intended). The capture process still involves holding the Vision Pro in front of you and using the cameras to 3D scan your face, but the detail of the avatar is so much more realistic. Here's what my new spatial Persona looks like in visionOS 26:

There are still some imperfections (like the crookedness of my striped shirt), but my face—my god—it's almost like staring into a mirror. My long hair part was rendered accurately, and when I smiled and laughed, my teeth, cheeks, and eyebrows moved more naturally as opposed to before, which was kind of stiff. My Persona no longer looks like a PS3 character. If you're paying $3,500 for Vision Pro, your virtual self damn well better look more realistic than a console from almost 20 years ago!

Apple's not saying what it did specifically to improve the quality of Personas (perhaps using more polygons?), but here's what the press release says: “Taking advantage of industry-leading volumetric rendering and machine learning technology, the all-new Personas now have striking expressivity and sharpness, offering a full side profile view, and remarkably accurate hair, lashes, and complexion.”

The rest of my Vision Pro demo was comparably mind-blowing (as Vision Pro still tends to be), but it also further drove home the fact that you need to have deep pockets in order to enjoy visionOS 26. I saw various widgets—clocks, calendars, a Lady Gaga poster that I could pinch with my fingers to play music, and even a framed window with a #shotoniPhone panorama of Japan's Mount Fuji that I could look “into.” The higher resolution of Vision Pro's displays and the ability for the widgets to stay anchored or pinned on a wall without jittering or moving made them look very convincing as real objects. The only thing that broke the illusion was almost walking into walls trying to look more closely at the widgets.

I also tried out the new spatial browsing in Safari. When toggled on, it turns the browser window into a Reader-ish mode view that removes all of a website's design and only shows the text and the media. As I scrolled down a page, 2D photos would convert into 3D ones with depth—Apple calls these “spatial scenes.” And man, do they look good. The depth isn't like some cheapo 3D movie conversion. They look like they're shot with expensive 3D cameras, and unlike most 3D content that has a certain sweet spot for feeling the depth, you can actually view them from different angles. It's really neat.

Before I took the Vision Pro off my head, I was teleported to the shore and taken ski gliding via 360-degree videos. Apple says visionOS 26 can play native 180-degree and 360-degree videos from Insta360, GoPro, and Canon cameras. There's no need to convert the video files into a compatible format for Vision Pro—they just work out of the box. While not as professional as Apple's own “Immersive Video” content, this should at least get the ball rolling on expanding user-created content. It's a baby step, but a necessary one considering one of the biggest roadblocks to the Vision Pro, besides the large price tag, is having enough spatial/immersive content for users to consume.

Apple didn't have a demo for using PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers to play games in Vision Pro, but I'm sure I'll get to try that out at some point. I have the controllers at home, so whenever that's ready to go, I'll give it a whirl.

I left my visionOS 26 demo impressed at the progress Apple's making. Spatial computing is starting to take a more solid shape. I just wish Apple would drop the price on Vision Pro or hurry up and release a cheaper version so more people could try out this cutting-edge tech. I always feel like nobody believes me when I tell them how awesome Vision Pro and visionOS are on a technological level. They just look at the price and stop listening, which is a real shame.

Democratic senators have concerns that the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could break the Social Security Administration's (SSA) tech infrastructure.

In a new letter addressed to SSA commissioner Frank Bisignano, senators Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden say that DOGE's plans to “hastily upgrade” SSA IT systems could disrupt the delivery of benefits or result in mass data losses. The warning comes after WIRED reported in March that DOGE officials were planning to rebuild SSA's code base in a matter of months. The move, originally spearheaded by Steve Davis, one of Elon Musk's key lieutenants and a leader at DOGE, could result in total system collapse, experts told WIRED at the time.

“Put simply, DOGE has already limited access to benefits by damaging SSA's technological infrastructure—and this rushed IT modernization plan can only exacerbate those problems,” the senators wrote in their letter.

Since DOGE infiltrated SSA earlier this year, the agency's website has crashed numerous times, making it difficult for beneficiaries to access their accounts. The outages could last a few minutes to nearly a day, the Washington Post reported in April. SSA officials have previously proposed plans to cut its workforce by 12 percent, or around 7,000 jobs. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal earlier this week, Bisignano described plans to revamp SSA into a “digital first” agency, relying heavily on artificial intelligence.

“DOGE staffers hacking away Social Security's backend tech with no safeguards is a recipe for disaster, not a serious update of the agency's digital infrastructure,” Warren tells WIRED. “This rush job risks people's private data, creates security gaps, and could result in catastrophic cuts to all benefits. If this DOGE experiment fails, it's the millions of Americans who rely on Social Security every month who will feel the pain.”

The senators called the “ultimate goal” to upgrade IT “a worthy one,” but called on officials to pursue it with the “appropriate testing and safeguards.” For years, SSA has tried to upgrade its data systems that are built on COBOL, a legacy coding language few engineers are trained to use. But these modernization plans are often expected to take years, not a few months like DOGE has planned.

In the letter, the senators ask Bisignano to detail DOGE's role in upgrading SSA's tech and any changes made to datasets and systems. They also ask for any information related to potential hacks or data leaks that may have occurred as a result of this modernization work. The senators asked Bisignano to respond by June 17.

“This is an environment that is held together with bail wire and duct tape,” a former senior SSA technologist working in the office of the chief information officer told WIRED in March. “The leaders need to understand that they're dealing with a house of cards or Jenga. If they start pulling pieces out, which they've already stated they're doing, things can break.”

Pretty much anyone can recognize the value of a good docking station—that goes double for any friends or family member who work from home. Many of us are primarily laptop users. It's comfortable to work from the couch, bring it to a coffee shop, or always have it with you when traveling for either work or leisure. However, a docking station allows you to open up possibilities with a larger work space when needed. And right now, this one from Dell is on sale for $40 off. That brings it down from $100 to just $60.

Sure, it feels fine to work just with the laptop alone but we deserve better than fine: sometimes it's better to have a fully robust workstation. My desk has two monitors, each significantly larger than my laptop screen. This is great for viewing multiple tabs at once or for gaming or video editing. I have a mechanical keyboard with raised, clicky-clacky keys which I find much more satisfying to type on than the flat keypad of my laptop. The speakers on my desk are louder and deeper than the ones built-into my computer. I've got a drawing tablet, a DSLR I've hooked up as a webcam for exceptional camera quality, and a powerful microphone. My laptop simply does not support all of those at once.

Most laptops might have two USB ports on it and that's it. A docking station allows us to use all of these extra accessories when our desks and it's easy to hook up to. Just plug in the laptop to the docking station and everything will be connected. Easy as pie.

This Dell DA305 docking station can charge devices and features the following ports. It's got one DisplayPort, on HDMI port, one USB-C port, two USB-A ports, and one Ethernet port. It's also got a patented retractable USB-C cable that you can handily pull out and plug in when it's time to dock your laptop.

Charging over the retractable USB-C cable allows for up to 90W power pass for your laptop so you don't even need to plug it in with its own adapter. It will charge as you have it docked while you work. Additionally, the DisplayPort and HDMI port support up to 4K resolution at 60Hz.

Best Buy has reduced the price of this Dell docking station to just $60. Get it now for 40% off.

Uptime Industries is taking a bet on on-premise AI infrastructure with an “AI-in-a-box” handheld device called Lemony AI.

The size of a sandwich, Lemony AI can supposedly run a large language model (LLM), AI agents, and AI workflows all on one node. Each Lemony requires only 65 watts of power to run, the equivalent of charging a laptop, and can be stacked and connected to form bigger AI clusters.

Sascha Buehrle, co-founder and CEO of Uptime, told TechCrunch that each node can sustain an LLM up to 75 billion parameters in size, and can host open source models or retrofitted versions of closed models. In a cluster of Lemony nodes, each device can run a different model.

Uptime is launching with partnerships with IBM and JetBrains to provide its customers easier access to AI  models, including IBM's closed models.

Like most tech startups, the idea for Lemony AI stemmed from a side project: Uptime's co-founders, Buehrle and Ivan Kuleshov, were trying to figure out if they could distribute language models on Raspberry Pi's micro computers, and while this wasn't originally related to generative AI, when it worked, they started trying to see what else these Raspberry Pis could handle.

When they realized running models on local devices could prove the key to unlock more AI adoption by organizations — say, enterprises that don't want to use cloud-based models — they started building a device of their own. They figured going small with an emphasis on data privacy could get companies to adopt AI quicker.

“We need to build something small which can go easily into the teams, and which [does] not require any organization-wide decision making — bringing on-premise generative AI solutions into the business teams, basically,” Buehrle said. Clusters of small and powerful devices can help the system grow according to a customer's needs, he added.

The company says it has already seen strong demand from business in heavily-regulated industries like finance, healthcare, and law.

“Everything stays in your box,” Buehrle said. “So your documents, your files, your emails — the models are hosted in the box, the agents are running locally in the box, and nothing is leaving the box.”

Uptime has so far raised $2 million in a seed funding round led by True Ventures, with participation from Alumni Ventures, JetBrains, and some angel investors. The company will use the funds to further develop its devices.

The startup says the plan now is to get the software it has developed for its micro AI computers, Lemony OS, to work on other companies' hardware, like the Nvidia DGX Spark. It also wants to expand the software from its current, single-user focus to one that can be used by teams.

Lemony AI costs $499 a month to use, and can be accessed by up to five users.

Maingear, a New Jersey-based company known primarily for its boutique gaming desktops, is today launching a new 18-inch gaming laptop that's packed to the gills with performance components.The Ultima 18, which starts at $3,599 on Maingear's website, utilizes an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor. There are two graphics options: Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5080 or 5090 Laptop GPU. Maingear says that the laptop was built with Clevo, which sells barebones systems to resellers that pick components. The Ultimate looks to be based on Clevo's X58xWNx-G based on specs and appearance.

CPU

Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX

GPU

Up to Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 Laptop GPU

RAM

Up to 192GB DDR5 (4 x 48GB)

Storage

Up to 4x M.2 SSDs (1x Gen 5x4, 3x Gen 4x4)

Display

18-inch, 3840 x 2400, 200 Hz, G-Sync

Battery

98 WHr

Wireless

Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4

Weight

8.8 pounds (3.99 kg)

Starting Price

$3,599

The display is just over 4K at 3840 x 2400, due to the 16:10 aspect ratio. This type of high-resolution screen is increasingly a rarity, even on the most powerful gaming laptops. The only other system we've seen this resolution on is the 18-inch panel on the MSI Titan 18 HX AI, one of the best gaming laptops.

While the Titan has a 120 Hz Mini-LED panel, Maingear has opted for a faster 200 Hz display without the fancier technology.Maingear's system also supports up to 192GB of RAM and has room for four M.2 SSDs. One of those SSD slots supports PCIe Gen 5x4, while the others all rely on Gen 4x4. The $3,599 starting configuration includes an RTX 5080, 32GB of Team Elite DDR5-4800 RAM, a 2TB T-Force A440 SSD, and Windows 11 Pro.



The system features a metal lid and palm rest. Ports are divided between the back and the sides for the system. The rear features an HDMI port, dual 2.5 Gb Ethernet ports, a lock slot, and the power jack. The sides feature a pair of Thunderbolt 5 ports, two USB Type-A ports, a 3.5 mm headphone jack, and a microSD card slot.18-inch systems are usually considered desktop replacements for a reason: their size. And this one is heavy, at 8.8 pounds, though Maingear says that the 330 watt power adapter is "backpack friendly" (and, to be fair, the point of getting a laptop — even one that's 8.8 pounds — is the option to move it from place to place).

The company states that there's no "OS-choking bloatware," which is a definite plus; Maingear's Control Center application lets you adjust RGB, fan settings, performance modes, and more. The other big software feature is Nvidia Advanced Optimus, which switches between the integrated and discrete GPU depending on power needs.Maingear is entering a crowded market of expensive, top-of-the-line gaming laptops that includes the likes of Alienware, Gigabyte, Razer, MSI, Asus, and more, putting the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 in premium designs with plenty of ports, fast screens, and high price tags.

When shopping for a monitor that does it all, it can be challenging to find one that prioritizes the right things. Creatives need accurate color, high resolution, flexibility of signal formats, and long-term reliability. Gamers need speed and smoothness, and to a lesser degree, the qualities I mentioned in the previous sentence. With the best gaming monitors commanding equally high prices, it's a good thing when shelling out over $1,000 to get as much functionality as possible in a single display.

The BenQ DesignVue line is designed for graphics professionals, offering accurate color, broad signal format support, and beautifully designed monitors that make you glad you spent a little more for something nice. Add in 4K resolution, 144 Hz, Adaptive-Sync, smooth overdrive, and low input lag, and you get the PD3226G. It's an IPS panel with DisplayHDR 400, wide gamut color, and one of the nicest designs I've seen in a while. Let's take a look.

The PD3226G starts with a bright IPS panel equipped with an edge array LED backlight. There are no Mini LEDs or local dimming, but in my tests, I achieved a peak brightness of 520 nits for HDR10 content. You can expect around 450 nits for SDR. There are no Quantum Dots, but the measured gamut covers 102% of DCI-P3, so there's plenty of color for any application or entertainment. A complete set of fixed color modes deliver specs from sRGB to Cinema P3 and even DICOM for medical imaging applications. Two user modes allow full calibration of white balance, gamma, and color management. You also get uniformity compensation to ensure perfect luminance across the 32-inch screen.

The PD3226G is a professional display first, but that doesn't mean its gaming capability is compromised. You might think 144 Hz is on the slow side when compared to the 240 Hz 4K OLEDs currently available. However, BenQ consistently delivers a precise overdrive and low input lag, and this monitor has been given the same treatment. You'll see on the next page that it meets or exceeds the standard set by several monitors with higher refresh rates. Bottom line: it games with the best 4K screens out there.

Build quality is always a BenQ hallmark, and the PD3226G manages to uplevel itself from what I've seen before. The stand is of particular note with a precise telescoping height adjustment and the feel of fine machinery. Physically, it is a cut above most premium displays in both operation and styling.

Convenience features include multiple USB ports, Type A and Type C, with KVM functions available in the OSD. The PD3226G also includes DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.1, and Thunderbolt in and out ports. It is equally comfortable connected to a Mac, PC, laptop, or gaming console. The USB ports are located on the bottom edge of the panel, and the other inputs face rearward for easy access. Audio is addressed, too, with a pair of decent-sounding internal speakers.

The PD3226G isn't a trivial purchase for $1,400. But in the professional genre, that's on the low side, with many less capable screens opening a larger hole in the wallet. You can process photos in the morning and frag your friends during lunch break with equal precision and enjoyment.

BenQ successfully makes the move to fully recyclable packaging with the PD3226G's contents secured in strategically folded cardboard bits. The panel, upright, and base are separate pieces that assemble without tools to create a solid package. The power supply is internal, so you get an IEC cord for juice along with cables for HDMI, Thunderbolt, and USB-A/C. There is no wire provided for DisplayPort. You also get the coolest remote control I've yet seen with a computer monitor. Check that out below.

BenQ includes the latest version of its HotKey Puck with the PD3226G, and it is seriously cool and unique. It looks like the pucks I've seen with other BenQ monitors, but this one is completely wireless. It uses IR and can be placed anywhere on the desk thanks to a large receiver on the panel's lower right corner. The dial adjusts brightness by default and can be programmed to a variety of monitor functions. There are three multi-function keys, plus a return button and input selector. Everything is programmable in the OSD. Need a quick look at the signal info? There's a dedicated button on the front, right where your thumb naturally falls. I love remotes with computer monitors, and this one is even better because you don't have to pick it up. If you prefer old-school methods, a traditional joystick can be found on the panel's bottom right edge.

From the front, the PD3226G is all business with a thin bezel finished in matte black. The screen's anti-glare layer effectively keeps reflections at bay and doesn't add any grain or artifacts to the sharp and bright image. With 140ppi pixel density, you won't see the dot structure unless you get very close. In the back, the color changes to white with a silver band across the bottom highlighting the inputs. You'll find the power plug, one HDMI 2.1, one DisplayPort 1.4, Thunderbolt in and out for daisy chaining, USB-C data and four more USBs, one C and three As, for peripherals and data transfer. You also get a 3.5mm headphone jack to complement the three-watt internal speakers. All the ports can be bound together in different combinations using the KVM feature in the OSD.

I've encountered many nice monitor stands during my travels, but none are as good as the one included with the PD3226G. The base is a smoothly finished aluminum plate, but the upright is the real gem. Unlike every other adjustable piece that uses a sliding track, the PD3226G employs a true telescoping design. It's just like a motorcycle fork leg, and it means height and swivel are on another level of smoothness and precision. You lose the cable management hole, but the benefit is, by far, the nicest stand you're likely to find. Adjustments include 5/20 degrees tilt, 30 degrees swivel, six inches of height, and a 90-degree portrait mode. If you'd rather use an arm, there's a 100mm VESA mount with fasteners included.

Pressing the large dial on the PD3226G's HotKey Puck brings up a quick menu, and a second click summons the full OSD. It's loaded with numerous options for image control and convenience, yet remains concise, efficient, and intuitive.

The signal menu has the input selector along with PIP and PBP options, which allow viewing of two video sources at once. This is followed by the image settings, which are all grouped into a single sub-menu. There are nine fixed modes for SDR and one for HDR. You also get two user modes, which allow for full calibration. One quirk I noted is that the fixed modes turn on the uniformity compensation. While it effectively maintains consistent luminance, it also cuts contrast in half according to my tests. My PD3226G sample had good uniformity without it so I opted to calibrate one of the User modes instead. More on that later.

DualView lets you compare two modes side by side, which is great for color grading when you need to support multiple standards in the same content. The rest of the menu features traditional luminance and color controls, including three fixed color temperatures and a single-point adjustable white balance. I'd like to see a two-point control here, given the PD3226G's professional slant.

Gamma and color management are found in the Advanced sub-menu at the bottom. You can choose from P3, sRGB, Rec.709 and Native. I found this a better way to achieve perfect color than the fixed modes, which are non-adjustable. It also allows me to turn off the uniformity compensation for the PD3226G's full dynamic range. The grayed-out Backlight Control is a field dimming option that works only for HDR content.

The HotKey Puck is fully programmable, as is the single function key under the panel edge. The dial is set for brightness by default. It's really cool to adjust luminance with a dial just like a vintage TV. The puck has a three-way switch so it can control three separate PD3226G's by setting the appropriate channel, also very cool.

There aren't a ton of gaming features here, like aiming points or timers. However, the PD3226G features an excellent overdrive option called AMA, which can be found in the system menu. There's also a burn-in cleaner that you'll never use and a toggle for Adaptive-Sync/VRR.

The PD3226G's fixed color modes are close enough to spec for most applications, but to achieve ultimate precision, you should calibrate one of the User modes. There, you can tweak the white balance, pick a gamut spec and choose one of the gamma presets. With a few changes, excellence is attained. Changing settings with the puck dial is super easy and quick. My SDR settings are below.

HDR signals get a single picture mode with only two options, contrast and backlight control. Changing contrast lowers peak brightness but will alter the EOTF from its optimal tracking. Backlight control is a field dimming option that you'll want to engage for maximum dynamic range and accuracy. It raises contrast to around 5,000:1.

As a gaming monitor, the PD3226G delivers well on all counts. It's quick and smooth, belying its 144 Hz refresh rate. While that would hamper some other 4K displays, BenQ's superb overdrive makes the most of that relatively low refresh rate. While it won't be mistaken for a 240 Hz OLED, it delivers some of the best gaming you'll find in a 4K LCD panel.

With lower input lag than just about any other UHD screen, I had no trouble whipping my way through fast-paced shooters. Aiming is precise and defensive maneuvers have a high degree of success. And the large pixel-dense image doesn't hurt either. 32-inch monitors are my jam, and I found the PD3226G hung with the best I've experienced. Some gamers might want aiming points and frame counters, which are absent here. But all you really need is good video processing and that is amply supplied.

As a professional monitor, I found a couple of minor quirks. The PD3226G is an IPS panel so you're not going to see super high contrast. It's about average at 1,000:1 in SDR mode and 5,000:1 for HDR. The higher figure is thanks to backlight control, AKA field dimming, which is only available for HDR. It would be nice to have that option for SDR as well.

When using the fixed color modes, they are accurate, but they lock uniformity compensation on which cuts contrast and peak brightness by half. I'm a fan of choices and one should have the ability to control compensation in every mode. The way to full dynamic range is in the two User modes, which require calibration if color grading is on the task list. Image controls proved to be precise, and I attained excellent numbers, but I would love to see more gamma presets and a two-point white balance.

HDR color was a bit undersaturated, and the test results you'll see on page five support this. There are no calibration options there, but BenQ could fix those issues with a firmware update. In practice, HDR looks decent with nice depth and texture. Reds are the most noticeably lacking in verve, while greens and blues are better.

My physical interactions were overwhelmingly positive. The PD3226G's build quality and styling are on another level thanks to its superb stand. The telescoping design is unique in my experience, and I hope to see it imitated by others. The HotKey Puck is also a serious value-add. BenQ has been a leader in monitor control for years and now that the wire is gone, it's even better. Remotes are cool and ones you don't need to pick up are cooler.

Takeaway: The PD3226G is a pleasure to game on and work with. It does everything well and connects with the user in an elegant and positive way. The SDR image is gorgeous with accurate color and premium video processing that keeps fast motion smooth. HDR color is a bit undersaturated, but the contrast is there. A firmware update from BenQ would take care of this neatly.

At 10:44 pm Eastern time on May 16, Ryan Hall spotted a blue square on his radar indicating debris flying into the air and realized a huge tornado was racing toward Somerset, Kentucky.

“We've been watching this storm for a while, we've been hootin' and hollerin' for a while, hopefully the message has gotten out there and we know to be in our safe spots,” Hall warned his YouTube audience in a calm voice with a Southern twang.

A silver robot with blue eyes popped onto the screen to tell Hall that a viewer had commented about tiny houses near the tornado. “Oh really?” Hall replied to his AI robot, known as Y'all Bot.

The 31-year-old host of Ryan Hall, Y'all—one of YouTube's most popular weather channels, with 2.8 million subscribers—went live for nearly 12 hours that day as more than 70 tornadoes swept through the central US, killing at least 28 people. Nineteen of the dead were in Kentucky. Hall, too, was under tornado warning as he streamed from his home in Kentucky.

Sirens went off in Somerset, but the National Weather Service lagged behind in upgrading its tornado warning, Hall told viewers. He also said that recent cuts had left the NWS office in Jackson, Kentucky, short-staffed. “We're about to have a large tornado go through a very populated area with much less warning than what there should be as a result of that,” he said. It wasn't until 10:57 pm that the NWS finally upgraded its tornado warning for Somerset.

Hall doesn't have a meteorology degree, but he employs meteorologists like 27-year-old Andy Hill, who frequently appears on his livestream. Hill was on vacation during the deadly tornadoes but noted that Hall had correctly read the radar. “He was just looking at, essentially, patterns and radar data, which is what I've attempted to teach him over the years,” Hill said. “On May 16, I think Ryan definitely saved some lives.”

A new generation of storm forecasters are going live on YouTube for hours during severe weather events, offering real-time updates to millions of subscribers through a network of storm chasers, and even using AI. Their devoted fans help shape the forecast by sending on-the-ground photos of these storms, for example lemon-sized hail, for the streamers to show live on their screens. As the Trump administration slashes federal weather forecasting staff and climate change supercharges storms, their reports are not only entertaining but also crucial and potentially life-saving.

This form of weather content is growing rapidly, but so far there are two main YouTube weather forecasters. Hall, who employs about 40 people across his media business and nonprofit, and YouTube's second biggest weather streamer, Max Velocity, are game changers who frequently warn their millions of fans about tornadoes on the ground before the National Weather Service issues official alerts. They do this by interpreting blobs of color on the radar and hosting feeds of storm chasers going live from their vehicles. Hall's AI bot interacts with him during storms, and it even has its own channel where it goes live 24/7.

At the same time that storm streamers, who are funded via ads on YouTube and merch sales, are booming, the primary source they rely on is in chaos. The Trump administration and Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have gutted staff at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Weather Service, meaning less accurate forecasts from all meteorologists. The NWS, which was already understaffed, has lost 600 employees since January; in June, the NOAA announced it would rehire 100 NWS workers.

And as yet another above-normal hurricane season begins, the new generation of storm streamers is careful to avoid the subject of climate change when talking to their audiences in deep red states—to avoid alienating viewers who don't believe in it.

Y'all Bot lives on a server in Hall's Weather House in Kentucky, a large home that is decked out with a studio, edit suites, and a tornado shelter. When Y'all Bot launched last year, its first job was to interact with Hall on the livestream, helping to fill dead air. Y'all Bot was buggy at first but learned the ropes quickly.

Now it has its own channel separate from Hall's with more than 800,000 subscribers where it goes live 365 days a year, regurgitating NWS warnings and interacting with viewers. Viewers post in the chat asking the bot to tell them the weather in their area, and it reads them the latest forecast. However, it hasn't learned how to read radar imagery yet, Hill said, and would likely never be able to do that independent of human supervision. “It's going through all the text-based information that it has access to and relaying it in a continuous format,” Hill said. “Humans have to sleep. We can't always be there.”

“It is 100 percent independent, running itself,” said Caleb Beacham, a 22-year-old storm chaser who worked for Hall before leaving in early June. “It has learned how to forecast weather all on its own through AI and computer learning.”

“We're seeing exponential growth on that channel,” Beacham said. He's aware of the backlash to AI but said their audience loves the little bot. “We're trying to embrace it and incorporate it into that life-saving information.”

Meanwhile, 22-year-old Max Schuster, who goes by Max Velocity, livestreams tornado and hurricane forecasts from his dorm room in Florida.

His more than 1 million YouTube subscribers are familiar with his cat Cheese Curd, who often walks across his desk, seeking attention. “I'll usually pick her up at some point during the stream and show everybody,” he tells WIRED.

His operation is bare-bones compared to Hall's. Behind him is a neon sign in the shape of a storm cloud with a lightning bolt. He uses one camera, five monitors, a couple of lights, and simple software that instantly broadcasts new NWS alerts onto his livestreams.

He recently graduated with a meteorology degree and is moving out of his dorm this summer into a larger studio space.

As traditional media shrinks, storm streamers are growing; Schuster recently hired his first full-time employee—Reilly Dibble, who used to work for Hall. Unlike a traditional broadcast, YouTube allows Schuster to go live before there's a tornado warning, so he can warn viewers if a storm is likely to produce a tornado. When Hurricane Milton hit Florida last year, causing a tornado outbreak, Schuster said he heard from a viewer that his livestream prompted their family members to seek shelter. “Our weather coverage is actually saving lives,” he said.

Schuster expects the storm-streaming world to get more crowded. He notes that competition has recently heated up between them. “It's bound to happen, but he wanted to make this more of a competition on YouTube,” he says. “We're definitely not as close as I thought we were.”

Traditional forecasters, storm streamers, and even Y'all Bot rely heavily on the National Weather Service; the agency is a primary source that runs radar sites, launches weather balloons, and flies planes into hurricanes.

Cuts across the National Weather Service are making storm streamers nervous. The NWS weather balloon launches collect valuable information on temperature, humidity, pressure, and winds. “Because there's been a lack of balloon launches, the data that's getting fed into these models just haven't been as good as they could have been,” Beacham said. Fewer planes flying into hurricanes will mean less accurate forecasts of where hurricanes will make landfall, Schuster said.

Jana Houser, a storm chaser and meteorology professor at Ohio State University, says the understaffing at the National Weather Service office in Jackson, Kentucky, during deadly tornadoes was “a small glimpse of what's to come.”

“The office did as good of a job as they could have possibly done, but they didn't have the resources that they could have possibly had in a different climate,” Houser says. “Unless we get full staffing in, there are going to be tired forecasters. There are going to be overworked people. There are going to be missed tornadoes.”

Houser said streamers like Hall are providing a public service. “He is helping to inform the general public, which is a service, especially under the context of a poorly funded and resource-starved National Weather Service.”

But she adds that storm streamers can misread the radar and raise the alarm about a cloud formation that is not capable of producing a tornado. This is problematic if there's conflicting information between a streamer and the NWS. “It can create a sense of distrust or confusion,” she said.

Hill said his team is “immensely careful,” but it's impossible to perfectly forecast tornadoes, and they do make mistakes. Calling tornadoes before the National Weather Service means they have a higher false-alarm rate than the federal agency, Hill said.

“There's a lot of layers there to justify before [the NWS] sends out a warning. So their false-alarm rate is going to be much lower than ours,” Hill said.

Hurricanes are becoming more frequent as global heating cooks the planet, but you wouldn't know it by watching the storm streamers. They know the climate is changing, but many of their viewers live in red states, so they avoid the subject. President Donald Trump has consistently downplayed climate change; during the 2024 election he called it “a big hoax.”

Yale's 2024 Climate Opinion Map that measures perceptions about climate change across the US found that a majority of people in hurricane-prone states like Florida, Texas, and Louisiana, and states in tornado alley, believe global warming is happening. But a sizable percentage of people in those states, around 30 percent, don't believe it's caused by human activities.

Schuster, whose fans are mostly based in the hurricane and tornado zones of Texas, Illinois, and Florida, believes climate change is happening. “If you deny it, I don't know what to tell you—there's a lot of scientific evidence,” he says

“My opinion is not based off politics or anything like that,” he continues. “It's based off of what I've been seeing data-wise, within the scientific field of meteorology.”

But he doesn't talk about it on his channel. “If I bring up climate change or something else, it'll probably end up being politicized.”

Hill, meanwhile, takes a more nuanced approach; he doesn't directly reference climate change, but he attempts to educate viewers about climatology, hoping they will become more open to believing in climate change.

“As a climatologist, that's the smartest way to handle it,” Hill says. “Because if I were to be direct with it, we would just lose 40 percent of our audience immediately.”

He knows he's walking a tricky line. “I don't think many people would be super happy about that, especially activists,” he says. But he argues that his approach is more likely to make climate skeptics curious instead of defensive. “Especially in those deep red states, there's plenty of people who are still on the fence,” he says.

“It's going to be a long-term thing, but it's going to be something I work on my whole life,” Hill says.

In the immediate future, the storm streamers are facing a busy hurricane season this year, and their audiences will likely continue to grow.

Beacham predicted that people will soon create AI bots that can read radar and livestream personalized weather forecasts. And he expects more people will launch storm forecasting channels. “We're going to see a lot more people start to do what Ryan and Max are doing,” he says. “They've proven that it's possible.”

I think we're in the wrong industry.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


As companies pour billions of dollars into AI infrastructure, demand for AI talent to program and run these AI data centers is also greatly increasing. Deedy Das, a Venture Capitalist at Menlo Ventures and a former Google Search staff member, posted on X that Meta has an over $2 million annual pay package for AI talent, but still keeps losing its people to OpenAI and Anthropic. He said that he's personally heard three such cases this week alone, which is major news given the size of Meta's compensation.

Statistics say that for every 10.6 from DeepMind, 8.2 from OpenAI, and 2 from Hugging Face that move to Anthropic, it only loses one employee for each company. This movement shows that the startup is quickly growing and that many people from competing AI labs want to work for it. We don't know how much the company offers, though, but we can safely assume that it's at least on par or, more likely, substantially larger than what the competition pays.

According to the SignalFire research, beyond salary, Anthropic's edge is a unique culture that embraces "unconventional thinkers" and gives employees true autonomy, as well as flexible work options, a lack of title politics and forced management tracks. Furthermore, employees report an embrace of intellectual discourse and researcher autonomy, compared to bureaucracy elsewhere.

Meta is currently offering $2M+/yr in offers for AI talent and still losing them to OpenAI and Anthropic. Heard ~3 such cases this week.The AI talent wars are absolutely ridiculous.Today, Anthropic has the highest ~80% retention 2 years in and is the #1 (large) company top AI… pic.twitter.com/YSv5UNV5H2June 10, 2025

Aside from this, Das also mentioned that Anthropic has an unusually high two-year employee retention rate. The tech industry average is around 40% to 50%, with the retention rate dropping over the past couple of years due to layoffs. However, many AI startups' two-year retention rates vary between 63% and 80%, with Anthropic holding the top spot. Next to it is Google's DeepMind, which has a retention rate of 78%.

Many new employees who work in AI labs also come from major tech giants. It's estimated that 5.4% of new hires come from Google's non-AI divisions, while 4.3% are former Meta staffers. A further 3.2% used to work with Microsoft, and another 2.7% are ex-Amazon employees, while 2.1% were previously affiliated with Stripe, and 1.7% came from Apple. This accounts for nearly 20% of new employees in AI labs that have come from tech giants.

Massive tech companies used to be the dream job for many people, especially as they offered competitive pay, strong career growth, many opportunities within the industry, and prestige. However, 2024 was a bad year for the tech sector, with many companies laying off thousands of people. Intel was one of the biggest losers, with the company laying off 15% of its workforce (roughly 15,000 employees) after its disastrous August 2024 financial report. However, other companies like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Dell, and AMD were also hit with workforce reductions.

On the other hand, the continued growth in the AI sector is pushing many talented individuals towards these startups, as shown by the data. This will likely continue in the near future, as companies and nations continuously build more and more AI data centers.

We haven't been excited about recent MacOS updates, but with MacOS 26 Tahoe, it looks like we'll be getting one of the biggest overhauls in a while.

Between the visual redesign and some exciting pro features, there's something for everyone in MacOS 26 Tahoe, including one that Mac nerds will absolutely love.

Also be sure to check out the full rundown of everything Apple announced at WWDC 2025.

It's been a while since Apple has introduced a visual revamp quite this broad. Liquid Glass is what Apple calls the visual motif of its next era in software design.

Marked by soft transparency and subtle gradients, the glass-like design appears in just about every interface, including the Menu Bar, the Lock Screen, app icons, and sidebars in apps. From what I've seen so far, it's a nice change, though some designers have concerns about how it might interfere with basic functionality. The aesthetic changes to macOS haven't been as drastic as what iOS has been through, but this appears to be a well-appreciated fresh coat of paint.

There's a few smaller design changes, such as the ability to change the color of folders or add an emoji to them. Control Center, located up top in the Menu Bar, has also been made completely transparent. More importantly, Apple has added tons more customization so you can add more quick settings to change. You can even add specific settings in commonly used apps such as Zoom.

MacOS Tahoe also brings over a design tweak that came to iPhones last year: tint for icons, which applies a unified look to all your icons at once. Honestly, I'm surprised this is coming to MacOS, because it wasn't well received by reviewers.

This is the feature I'm most excited about. The Spotlight search tool has always been one of my favorite features in MacOS, and I've been waiting for Apple to take this popular feature to the next level. It's smarter on just about every level, quickly offering up apps, documents, or even your clipboard history. But this update is far more than that.

First off, Spotlight can now perform system actions and even in-app actions, such as playing a podcast or starting a recording. You can even fill out parameters such as who you're sending an email to—again, right in Spotlight!

Spotlight gets greatly enhanced in Tahoe.

Hundreds of actions can now be triggered from Spotlight, like sending an email, creating a note, or playing a podcast.

But wait, there's more. There are even Quick Keys you can use to speed things up further. Type “sm” to send a message or “ar” to create a reminder. Think next-level key commands with these. You can set up your own Quick Keys too, really expanding the capabilities and customization. For example, you can set up Quick Keys to take actions within an app that you're using, letting you quickly set up a task all from the keyboard. It's for the Mac nerds out there who are already know every other key command, and I can't wait to try it out.

Shortcuts can be a really powerful way of automating tasks on your Mac. With MacOS Tahoe, these get upgraded by Apple Intelligence, letting you set up shortcuts like summarizing text or generating images. You can even tap into ChatGPT (or the on-device Neural Engine) if necessary, setting up chains of actions that could potentially be extremely useful. For example, you might create a Shortcut that compares notes from text in Notes from a lecture to an audio transcription, and then summarize the differences using Apple Intelligence.

The new actions in Shortcuts.

Bonus points—you can now access these AI-powered shortcuts through the aforementioned Spotlight update.

This one was a bit of a surprise. As part of its ever-growing suite of Continuity features, the Phone app is now coming to Macs. Why put a Phone app on a device that doesn't have a cellular modem? It doesn't make a lot of sense on the surface, but remember, you can intake calls from your iPhone directly to your Mac.

With the app will come all the same newly announced features on iOS 26, such as live translation in calls, new backgrounds for contacts, and automatically screened calls. Not surprisingly, all the changes to group chats will also be coming to the Mac Messages app.

I do think the inclusion of the Phone app could point us in the direction of 5G MacBooks in the future, something Apple has resisted for a long time. While cellular laptops aren't exactly common these days, it certainly feels more possible now that the Phone app is here. So who knows? Maybe the M6 MacBook Pros due out later this year will have a surprise option for cellular connectivity to better make use of the Phone app.

Live Activities from an iPhone will appear in the Mac's menu bar.

Apple is also introducing Live Activities to the Mac, which will hand off an ongoing task from your iPhone, such as an Uber Eats order, and give you updates right in the Menu Bar on your Mac.

There were a couple other features worth mentioning. One is improvements to gaming, with a dedicated Games app, similar to what will be in iPadOS 26 and iOS 26. It's perhaps the most useful here on the Mac, though, since the question of which games are available on Mac often comes up. It also allows Apple to highlight some of the bigger games coming, such as Cyberpunk 2077.

The new Apple Games app.

The more exciting part is the new Game Overlay, something that PC gamers usually have access to. The overlay let's you chat with friends, adjust settings, and more without having to exit the game.

Game Overlay lets players adjust their settings, chat, or invite new players.

Some smaller changes include the ability to capture audio recordings within the Notes app, the Journal app coming to the Mac for the first time, and a new Magnifier feature that zooms in with your connected webcam or camera. As per usual, many of the smaller changes will be discovered later in the release, and some new features may pop up along the way.

The public beta for macOS Tahoe will be available starting in July, with the official release expected in the fall of 2025.

The developer beta release, meanwhile, was launched the day of the announcement, and you don't have to be a developer to install it. We don't typically recommend installing developer betas, as they can be quite buggy, but for the adventurous, you can find the developer beta under Software Update in System Settings by clicking on the “i” icon next to Beta Updates. So long as you have a compatible Mac, you can install it and play around. Just be sure to back up all of your data first.

If you have a recent Mac, even as old as a 2020 M1 MacBook Air, you'll be able to download and install MacOS Tahoe as a free upgrade when it's released later this year.

Tesla doesn't have a strong history of releasing things on time or with promised functionality. After the latest in a series of setbacks, it seems like the EV giant's long-awaited robotaxi service will continue that trend. While Tesla insiders now report the program will launch on June 12 in Austin, Texas, it's still unclear what it will look like then.

In 2019, CEO Elon Musk said he was “very confident” that Tesla robotaxis would launch in 2020 and that by 2022, any non-Tesla vehicles would look like horses in comparison. Fast forward to 2025, and neither prediction has come true. Its hopefuls are still waiting on an autonomous taxi, and the company's Full Self-Driving features have a history of crashes, largely stemming from failing to recognize obstacles.

That's not to say the automaker hasn't seen any victories lately. It looks poised to emerge from high tariffs on the auto industry relatively unscathed, which is not the case for many other U.S. car manufacturers. Rollbacks on crash reporting requirements and loosening self-driving regulations could help Tesla, too, given its autonomous features' less-than-stellar safety record.

Still, Tesla's promised robotaxi service may face an uphill battle to get off the ground. Even deciding on a name has proven difficult, as the U.S. Patent Office has denied Tesla's trademark attempt for “Robotaxi.”

According to the Patent Office, Tesla's targeted name “merely describes a feature” of the car and that it “is used to describe similar goods and services by other companies.” Tesla also tried to trademark “Cybercab” as an alternative, but the Patent Office rejected this attempt, too, saying the word “cab” was generic and “cyber” was “so similar to a registered mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken or deceived.”

Failing to secure a trademark is far from the only challenge facing the would-be autonomous taxi service. Earlier this year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) began investigating 2.6 million Teslas after the Actually Smart Summon feature caused numerous unreported crashes.

Tesla's Robotaxi Could Self-Drive Your Faith in Autonomous Cars Right Off a Cliff

The investigation comes on the heels of another one the NHTSA opened in October 2024. This earlier probe concerns Tesla's Full Self-Driving function, which reportedly caused crashes in low light, with one incident even killing a pedestrian. Such prominent safety concerns over the company's autonomous capabilities cast doubt over whether its robotaxi service can safely transport anyone.

Last year, Tesla laid off 10% of its workforce, which is both emblematic of a larger problem and may pose further issues. Vehicle deliveries are declining for the brand, tightening margins, and fewer staff may make it harder to roll out necessary self-driving improvements on time. Still, the newly announced June 12 launch date makes it seem like those obstacles haven't stopped the service from rolling out for now.

Despite these roadblocks, Musk says Tesla will start robotaxi production in 2026, which seems unlikely. Considering he also said he was confident in a 2020 release, it's hard to put much stake in his claims about a release timeline. Tesla at least has prototypes already, but that's far from a government-approved, working model. Musk's ties to the administration and DOGE's workforce cuts to regulators like the NHTSA could make the government approval portion less of a hurdle, but the technology's maturity is still uncertain. And Musk's suddenly acrimonious relationship with Trump may cause new issues for the once-favored automaker.

Autonomous taxi services, as a whole, have proved challenging to scale. GM started testing self-driving cars in 2016, only to cancel the project in 2024, citing high costs and rising competition. Driverless vehicles require immense resources, and even after years of advancement, they're still far from perfect. Tesla's series of crashes highlights the lingering safety concerns.

Of course, some robotaxi services have gotten up and running and successfully ferry passengers in some cities. However, getting approval to run these programs is a long and complex process that Tesla has only just begun. It recently obtained one necessary California permit but has reportedly not even applied for the licenses it needs from the DMV to charge customers for autonomous taxi services. Texas, though, requires no special licensing for autonomous vehicles, so a June 12 robotaxi release in Austin is still possible.

Once Tesla secures regulatory approval, its robotaxi rollout may not look exactly like it suggested in its October reveal. Most notably, Musk has confirmed that it will start with existing Model Xs and Model Ys, not the sleek, trademarked-name-pending cabs it showed off at that event.

Former Waymo CEO John Krafcik has criticized Tesla's taxi design, saying it “makes it difficult for people to get in and out easily—not everyone will be able to use these robotaxi vehicles comfortably.” He even suggested Tesla's self-driving claims may be misleading, citing “many ways to fake a robotaxi service.”

Tesla has come under scrutiny before for claiming to demonstrate autonomous robots when the machines were actually remote-controlled by humans. Its robotaxis could do the same, especially considering Tesla may need a remote steering function for safety purposes. There's a lot of uncertainty around the robotaxi release, but it seems certain it won't be what Tesla originally showcased.

There may not yet be telescopes capable of unlocking all the secrets of supermassive black holes, but AI is now on the case. Recently, an international team of astronomers successfully trained a neural network with millions of black hole simulations to allow it to interpret fuzzy data captured from these enigmatic space objects in real life.

Of the various methods for investigating a black hole, the Event Horizon Telescope is the most famous. The EHT isn't a single instrument but rather a number of radio telescopes around the world that work together like a single telescope. Thanks to the EHT, it's been possible to obtain images of the supermassive black holes M87 and Sagittarius A*. These are not images in the traditional sense but instead are visualizations of radio waves coming from the black holes.

To create these images, supercomputers in different parts of the world processed the radio signals captured by the EHT. But in the process, they discarded much of the information gathered, as it was difficult to interpret. The new neural network, trained by experts at the Morgridge Research Institute in Wisconsin, aims to tap into that sea of data to improve the resolution of the EHT's readings and make new discoveries.

According to a press release from the institute, the artificial intelligence successfully analyzed the once-discarded information and established new parameters of Sagittarius A*, which sits at the center of the Milky Way. An alternative image of the black hole's structure was generated, with this revealing some new characteristics of the black hole.

“Researchers now suspect that the black hole at the center of the Milky Way is spinning at almost top speed,” wrote the researchers in a press release. The new image also also indicates that the black hole's rotation axis points to the Earth and gives clues as to the causes and characteristics of the disks of material that circulate around the black hole.

Astronomers had previously estimated that Sagittarius A* rotates at a moderate to fast speed. Knowing its actual rotational speed is important, since it allows us to infer how the radiation around the black hole behaves and provides clues about its stability.

“That we are defying the prevailing theory is of course exciting,” lead researcher Michael Janssen, of Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, said in the press release. “However, I see our AI and machine learning approach primarily as a first step. Next, we will improve and extend the associated models and simulations.”

This story is a partnership between MIT Technology Review, Lighthouse Reports, and Trouw, and was supported by the Pulitzer Center. 

Hans de Zwart, a gym teacher turned digital rights advocate, says that when he saw Amsterdam's plan to have an algorithm evaluate every welfare applicant in the city for potential fraud, he nearly fell out of his chair. 

It was February 2023, and de Zwart, who had served as the executive director of Bits of Freedom, the Netherlands' leading digital rights NGO, had been working as an informal advisor to Amsterdam's city government for nearly two years, reviewing and providing feedback on the AI systems it was developing. 

According to the city's documentation, this specific AI model—referred to as “Smart Check”—would consider submissions from potential welfare recipients and determine who might have submitted an incorrect application. More than any other project that had come across his desk, this one stood out immediately, he told us—and not in a good way. “There's some very fundamental [and] unfixable problems,” he says, in using this algorithm “on real people.”

The US criminal legal system uses predictive algorithms to try to make the judicial process less biased. But there's a deeper problem.

From his vantage point behind the sweeping arc of glass windows at Amsterdam's city hall, Paul de Koning, a consultant to the city whose résumé includes stops at various agencies in the Dutch welfare state, had viewed the same system with pride. De Koning, who managed Smart Check's pilot phase, was excited about what he saw as the project's potential to improve efficiency and remove bias from Amsterdam's social benefits system. 

A team of fraud investigators and data scientists had spent years working on Smart Check, and de Koning believed that promising early results had vindicated their approach. The city had consulted experts, run bias tests, implemented technical safeguards, and solicited feedback from the people who'd be affected by the program—more or less following every recommendation in the ethical-AI playbook. “I got a good feeling,” he told us. 

These opposing viewpoints epitomize a global debate about whether algorithms can ever be fair when tasked with making decisions that shape people's lives. Over the past several years of efforts to use artificial intelligence in this way, examples of collateral damage have mounted: nonwhite job applicants weeded out of job application pools in the US, families being wrongly flagged for child abuse investigations in Japan, and low-income residents being denied food subsidies in India. 

Proponents of these assessment systems argue that they can create more efficient public services by doing more with less and, in the case of welfare systems specifically, reclaim money that is allegedly being lost from the public purse. In practice, many were poorly designed from the start. They sometimes factor in personal characteristics in a way that leads to discrimination, and sometimes they have been deployed without testing for bias or effectiveness. In general, they offer few options for people to challenge—or even understand—the automated actions directly affecting how they live. 

The result has been more than a decade of scandals. In response, lawmakers, bureaucrats, and the private sector, from Amsterdam to New York, Seoul to Mexico City, have been trying to atone by creating algorithmic systems that integrate the principles of “responsible AI”—an approach that aims to guide AI development to benefit society while minimizing negative consequences. 

Developing and deploying ethical AI is a top priority for the European Union, and the same was true for the US under former president Joe Biden, who released a blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. That plan was rescinded by the Trump administration, which has removed considerations of equity and fairness, including in technology, at the national level. Nevertheless, systems influenced by these principles are still being tested by leaders in countries, states, provinces, and cities—in and out of the US—that have immense power to make decisions like whom to hire, when to investigate cases of potential child abuse, and which residents should receive services first. 

Amsterdam indeed thought it was on the right track. City officials in the welfare department believed they could build technology that would prevent fraud while protecting citizens' rights. They followed these emerging best practices and invested a vast amount of time and money in a project that eventually processed live welfare applications. But in their pilot, they found that the system they'd developed was still not fair and effective. Why? 

Lighthouse Reports, MIT Technology Review, and the Dutch newspaper Trouw have gained unprecedented access to the system to try to find out. In response to a public records request, the city disclosed multiple versions of the Smart Check algorithm and data on how it evaluated real-world welfare applicants, offering us unique insight into whether, under the best possible conditions, algorithmic systems can deliver on their ambitious promises.  

The answer to that question is far from simple. For de Koning, Smart Check represented technological progress toward a fairer and more transparent welfare system. For de Zwart, it represented a substantial risk to welfare recipients' rights that no amount of technical tweaking could fix. As this algorithmic experiment unfolded over several years, it called into question the project's central premise: that responsible AI can be more than a thought experiment or corporate selling point—and actually make algorithmic systems fair in the real world.

Understanding how Amsterdam found itself conducting a high-stakes endeavor with AI-driven fraud prevention requires going back four decades, to a national scandal around welfare investigations gone too far. 

In 1984, Albine Grumböck, a divorced single mother of three, had been receiving welfare for several years when she learned that one of her neighbors, an employee at the social service's local office, had been secretly surveilling her life. He documented visits from a male friend, who in theory could have been contributing unreported income to the family. On the basis of his observations, the welfare office cut Grumböck's benefits. She fought the decision in court and won.

Despite her personal vindication, Dutch welfare policy has continued to empower welfare fraud investigators, sometimes referred to as “toothbrush counters,” to turn over people's lives. This has helped create an atmosphere of suspicion that leads to problems for both sides, says Marc van Hoof, a lawyer who has helped Dutch welfare recipients navigate the system for decades: “The government doesn't trust its people, and the people don't trust the government.”

Harry Bodaar, a career civil servant, has observed the Netherlands' welfare policy up close throughout much of this time—first as a social worker, then as a fraud investigator, and now as a welfare policy advisor for the city. The past 30 years have shown him that “the system is held together by rubber bands and staples,” he says. “And if you're at the bottom of that system, you're the first to fall through the cracks.”

Making the system work better for beneficiaries, he adds, was a large motivating factor when the city began designing Smart Check in 2019. “We wanted to do a fair check only on the people we [really] thought needed to be checked,” Bodaar says—in contrast to previous department policy, which until 2007 was to conduct home visits for every applicant. 

But he also knew that the Netherlands had become something of a ground zero for problematic welfare AI deployments. The Dutch government's attempts to modernize fraud detection through AI had backfired on a few notorious occasions.

In 2019, it was revealed that the national government had been using an algorithm to create risk profiles that it hoped would help spot fraud in the child care benefits system. The resulting scandal saw nearly 35,000 parents, most of whom were migrants or the children of migrants, wrongly accused of defrauding the assistance system over six years. It put families in debt, pushed some into poverty, and ultimately led the entire government to resign in 2021.  

In Rotterdam, a 2023 investigation by Lighthouse Reports into a system for detecting welfare fraud found it to be biased against women, parents, non-native Dutch speakers, and other vulnerable groups, eventually forcing the city to suspend use of the system. Other cities, like Amsterdam and Leiden, used a system called the Fraud Scorecard, which was first deployed more than 20 years ago and included education, neighborhood, parenthood, and gender as crude risk factors to assess welfare applicants; that program was also discontinued.

The Netherlands is not alone. In the United States, there have been at least 11 cases in which state governments used algorithms to help disperse public benefits, according to the nonprofit Benefits Tech Advocacy Hub, often with troubling results. Michigan, for instance, falsely accused 40,000 people of committing unemployment fraud. And in France, campaigners are taking the national welfare authority to court over an algorithm they claim discriminates against low-income applicants and people with disabilities. 

This string of scandals, as well as a growing awareness of how racial discrimination can be embedded in algorithmic systems, helped fuel the growing emphasis on responsible AI. It's become “this umbrella term to say that we need to think about not just ethics, but also fairness,” says Jiahao Chen, an ethical-AI consultant who has provided auditing services to both private and local government entities. “I think we are seeing that realization that we need things like transparency and privacy, security and safety, and so on.” 

The approach, based on a set of tools intended to rein in the harms caused by the proliferating technology, has given rise to a rapidly growing field built upon a familiar formula: white papers and frameworks from think tanks and international bodies, and a lucrative consulting industry made up of traditional power players like the Big 5 consultancies, as well as a host of startups and nonprofits. In 2019, for instance, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a global economic policy body, published its Principles on Artificial Intelligence as a guide for the development of “trustworthy AI.” Those principles include building explainable systems, consulting public stakeholders, and conducting audits. 

But the legacy left by decades of algorithmic misconduct has proved hard to shake off, and there is little agreement on where to draw the line between what is fair and what is not. While the Netherlands works to institute reforms shaped by responsible AI at the national level, Algorithm Audit, a Dutch NGO that has provided ethical-AI auditing services to government ministries, has concluded that the technology should be used to profile welfare recipients only under strictly defined conditions, and only if systems avoid taking into account protected characteristics like gender. Meanwhile, Amnesty International, digital rights advocates like de Zwart, and some welfare recipients themselves argue that when it comes to making decisions about people's lives, as in the case of social services, the public sector should not be using AI at all.

Amsterdam hoped it had found the right balance. “We've learned from the things that happened before us,” says Bodaar, the policy advisor, of the past scandals. And this time around, the city wanted to build a system that would “show the people in Amsterdam we do good and we do fair.”

Every time an Amsterdam resident applies for benefits, a caseworker reviews the application for irregularities. If an application looks suspicious, it can be sent to the city's investigations department—which could lead to a rejection, a request to correct paperwork errors, or a recommendation that the candidate receive less money. Investigations can also happen later, once benefits have been dispersed; the outcome may force recipients to pay back funds, and even push some into debt.

Officials have broad authority over both applicants and existing welfare recipients. They can request bank records, summon beneficiaries to city hall, and in some cases make unannounced visits to a person's home. As investigations are carried out—or paperwork errors fixed—much-needed payments may be delayed. And often—in more than half of the investigations of applications, according to figures provided by Bodaar—the city finds no evidence of wrongdoing. In those cases, this can mean that the city has “wrongly harassed people,” Bodaar says. 

The Smart Check system was designed to avoid these scenarios by eventually replacing the initial caseworker who flags which cases to send to the investigations department. The algorithm would screen the applications to identify those most likely to involve major errors, based on certain personal characteristics, and redirect those cases for further scrutiny by the enforcement team.

If all went well, the city wrote in its internal documentation, the system would improve on the performance of its human caseworkers, flagging fewer welfare applicants for investigation while identifying a greater proportion of cases with errors. In one document, the city projected that the model would prevent up to 125 individual Amsterdammers from facing debt collection and save €2.4 million annually. 

Smart Check was an exciting prospect for city officials like de Koning, who would manage the project when it was deployed. He was optimistic, since the city was taking a scientific approach, he says; it would “see if it was going to work” instead of taking the attitude that “this must work, and no matter what, we will continue this.”

It was the kind of bold idea that attracted optimistic techies like Loek Berkers, a data scientist who worked on Smart Check in only his second job out of college. Speaking in a cafe tucked behind Amsterdam's city hall, Berkers remembers being impressed at his first contact with the system: “Especially for a project within the municipality,” he says, it “was very much a sort of innovative project that was trying something new.”

Smart Check made use of an algorithm called an “explainable boosting machine,” which allows people to more easily understand how AI models produce their predictions. Most other machine-learning models are often regarded as “black boxes” running abstract mathematical processes that are hard to understand for both the employees tasked with using them and the people affected by the results. 

The Smart Check model would consider 15 characteristics—including whether applicants had previously applied for or received benefits, the sum of their assets, and the number of addresses they had on file—to assign a risk score to each person. It purposefully avoided demographic factors, such as gender, nationality, or age, that were thought to lead to bias. It also tried to avoid “proxy” factors—like postal codes—that may not look sensitive on the surface but can become so if, for example, a postal code is statistically associated with a particular ethnic group.

In an unusual step, the city has disclosed this information and shared multiple versions of the Smart Check model with us, effectively inviting outside scrutiny into the system's design and function. With this data, we were able to build a hypothetical welfare recipient to get insight into how an individual applicant would be evaluated by Smart Check.  

This model was trained on a data set encompassing 3,400 previous investigations of welfare recipients. The idea was that it would use the outcomes from these investigations, carried out by city employees, to figure out which factors in the initial applications were correlated with potential fraud. 

But using past investigations introduces potential problems from the start, says Sennay Ghebreab, scientific director of the Civic AI Lab (CAIL) at the University of Amsterdam, one of the external groups that the city says it consulted with. The problem of using historical data to build the models, he says, is that “we will end up [with] historic biases.” For example, if caseworkers historically made higher rates of mistakes with a specific ethnic group, the model could wrongly learn to predict that this ethnic group commits fraud at higher rates. 

The city decided it would rigorously audit its system to try to catch such biases against vulnerable groups. But how bias should be defined, and hence what it actually means for an algorithm to be fair, is a matter of fierce debate. Over the past decade, academics have proposed dozens of competing mathematical notions of fairness, some of which are incompatible. This means that a system designed to be “fair” according to one such standard will inevitably violate others.

Amsterdam officials adopted a definition of fairness that focused on equally distributing the burden of wrongful investigations across different demographic groups. 

In other words, they hoped this approach would ensure that welfare applicants of different backgrounds would carry the same burden of being incorrectly investigated at similar rates. 

As it built Smart Check, Amsterdam consulted various public bodies about the model, including the city's internal data protection officer and the Amsterdam Personal Data Commission. It also consulted private organizations, including the consulting firm Deloitte. Each gave the project its approval. 

But one key group was not on board: the Participation Council, a 15-member advisory committee composed of benefits recipients, advocates, and other nongovernmental stakeholders who represent the interests of the people the system was designed to help—and to scrutinize. The committee, like de Zwart, the digital rights advocate, was deeply troubled by what the system could mean for individuals already in precarious positions. 

Anke van der Vliet, now in her 70s, is one longtime member of the council. After she sinks slowly from her walker into a seat at a restaurant in Amsterdam's Zuid neighborhood, where she lives, she retrieves her reading glasses from their case. “We distrusted it from the start,” she says, pulling out a stack of papers she's saved on Smart Check. “Everyone was against it.”

For decades, she has been a steadfast advocate for the city's welfare recipients—a group that, by the end of 2024, numbered around 35,000. In the late 1970s, she helped found Women on Welfare, a group dedicated to exposing the unique challenges faced by women within the welfare system.

City employees first presented their plan to the Participation Council in the fall of 2021. Members like van der Vliet were deeply skeptical. “We wanted to know, is it to my advantage or disadvantage?” she says. 

Two more meetings could not convince them. Their feedback did lead to key changes—including reducing the number of variables the city had initially considered to calculate an applicant's score and excluding variables that could introduce bias, such as age, from the system. But the Participation Council stopped engaging with the city's development efforts altogether after six months. “The Council is of the opinion that such an experiment affects the fundamental rights of citizens and should be discontinued,” the group wrote in March 2022. Since only around 3% of welfare benefit applications are fraudulent, the letter continued, using the algorithm was “disproportionate.”

De Koning, the project manager, is skeptical that the system would ever have received the approval of van der Vliet and her colleagues. “I think it was never going to work that the whole Participation Council was going to stand behind the Smart Check idea,” he says. “There was too much emotion in that group about the whole process of the social benefit system.” He adds, “They were very scared there was going to be another scandal.” 

But for advocates working with welfare beneficiaries, and for some of the beneficiaries themselves, the worry wasn't a scandal but the prospect of real harm. The technology could not only make damaging errors but leave them even more difficult to correct—allowing welfare officers to “hide themselves behind digital walls,” says Henk Kroon, an advocate who assists welfare beneficiaries at the Amsterdam Welfare Association, a union established in the 1970s. Such a system could make work “easy for [officials],” he says. “But for the common citizens, it's very often the problem.” 

Despite the Participation Council's ultimate objections, the city decided to push forward and put the working Smart Check model to the test. 

The first results were not what they'd hoped for. When the city's advanced analytics team ran the initial model in May 2022, they found that the algorithm showed heavy bias against migrants and men, which we were able to independently verify. 

As the city told us and as our analysis confirmed, the initial model was more likely to wrongly flag non-Dutch applicants. And it was nearly twice as likely to wrongly flag an applicant with a non-Western nationality than one with a Western nationality. The model was also 14% more likely to wrongly flag men for investigation. 

In the process of training the model, the city also collected data on who its human case workers had flagged for investigation and which groups the wrongly flagged people were more likely to belong to. In essence, they ran a bias test on their own analog system—an important way to benchmark that is rarely done before deploying such systems. 

What they found in the process led by caseworkers was a strikingly different pattern. Whereas the Smart Check model was more likely to wrongly flag non-Dutch nationals and men, human caseworkers were more likely to wrongly flag Dutch nationals and women. 

The team behind Smart Check knew that if they couldn't correct for bias, the project would be canceled. So they turned to a technique from academic research, known as training-data reweighting. In practice, that meant applicants with a non-Western nationality who were deemed to have made meaningful errors in their applications were given less weight in the data, while those with a Western nationality were given more.

Eventually, this appeared to solve their problem: As Lighthouse's analysis confirms, once the model was reweighted, Dutch and non-Dutch nationals were equally likely to be wrongly flagged. 

De Koning, who joined the Smart Check team after the data was reweighted, said the results were a positive sign: “Because it was fair … we could continue the process.” 

The model also appeared to be better than caseworkers at identifying applications worthy of extra scrutiny, with internal testing showing a 20% improvement in accuracy.

Buoyed by these results, in the spring of 2023, the city was almost ready to go public. It submitted Smart Check to the Algorithm Register, a government-run transparency initiative meant to keep citizens informed about machine-learning algorithms either in development or already in use by the government.

For de Koning, the city's extensive assessments and consultations were encouraging, particularly since they also revealed the biases in the analog system. But for de Zwart, those same processes represented a profound misunderstanding: that fairness could be engineered. 

In a letter to city officials, de Zwart criticized the premise of the project and, more specifically, outlined the unintended consequences that could result from reweighting the data. It might reduce bias against people with a migration background overall, but it wouldn't guarantee fairness across intersecting identities; the model could still discriminate against women with a migration background, for instance. And even if that issue were addressed, he argued, the model might still treat migrant women in certain postal codes unfairly, and so on. And such biases would be hard to detect.

“The city has used all the tools in the responsible-AI tool kit,” de Zwart told us. “They have a bias test, a human rights assessment; [they have] taken into account automation bias—in short, everything that the responsible-AI world recommends. Nevertheless, the municipality has continued with something that is fundamentally a bad idea.”

Ultimately, he told us, it's a question of whether it's legitimate to use data on past behavior to judge “future behavior of your citizens that fundamentally you cannot predict.” 

Officials still pressed on—and set March 2023 as the date for the pilot to begin. Members of Amsterdam's city council were given little warning. In fact, they were only informed the same month—to the disappointment of Elisabeth IJmker, a first-term council member from the Green Party, who balanced her role in municipal government with research on religion and values at Amsterdam's Vrije University. 

“Reading the words ‘algorithm' and ‘fraud prevention' in one sentence, I think that's worth a discussion,” she told us. But by the time that she learned about the project, the city had already been working on it for years. As far as she was concerned, it was clear that the city council was “being informed” rather than being asked to vote on the system. 

The city hoped the pilot could prove skeptics like her wrong.

The formal launch of Smart Check started with a limited set of actual welfare applicants, whose paperwork the city would run through the algorithm and assign a risk score to determine whether the application should be flagged for investigation. At the same time, a human would review the same application. 

Smart Check's performance would be monitored on two key criteria. First, could it consider applicants without bias? And second, was Smart Check actually smart? In other words, could the complex math that made up the algorithm actually detect welfare fraud better and more fairly than human caseworkers? 

It didn't take long to become clear that the model fell short on both fronts. 

While it had been designed to reduce the number of welfare applicants flagged for investigation, it was flagging more. And it proved no better than a human caseworker at identifying those that actually warranted extra scrutiny. 

What's more, despite the lengths the city had gone to in order to recalibrate the system, bias reemerged in the live pilot. But this time, instead of wrongly flagging non-Dutch people and men as in the initial tests, the model was now more likely to wrongly flag applicants with Dutch nationality and women. 

Lighthouse's own analysis also revealed other forms of bias unmentioned in the city's documentation, including a greater likelihood that welfare applicants with children would be wrongly flagged for investigation. (Amsterdam officials did not respond to a request for comment about this finding, nor other follow up questions about general critiques of the city's welfare system.)

The city was stuck. Nearly 1,600 welfare applications had been run through the model during the pilot period. But the results meant that members of the team were uncomfortable continuing to test—especially when there could be genuine consequences. In short, de Koning says, the city could not “definitely” say that “this is not discriminating.” 

He, and others working on the project, did not believe this was necessarily a reason to scrap Smart Check. They wanted more time—say, “a period of 12 months,” according to de Koning—to continue testing and refining the model. 

They knew, however, that would be a hard sell. 

In late November 2023, Rutger Groot Wassink—the city official in charge of social affairs—took his seat in the Amsterdam council chamber. He glanced at the tablet in front of him and then addressed the room: “I have decided to stop the pilot.”

The announcement brought an end to the sweeping multiyear experiment. In another council meeting a few months later, he explained why the project was terminated: “I would have found it very difficult to justify, if we were to come up with a pilot … that showed the algorithm contained enormous bias,” he said. “There would have been parties who would have rightly criticized me about that.” 

Viewed in a certain light, the city had tested out an innovative approach to identifying fraud in a way designed to minimize risks, found that it had not lived up to its promise, and scrapped it before the consequences for real people had a chance to multiply. 

But for IJmker and some of her city council colleagues focused on social welfare, there was also the question of opportunity cost. She recalls speaking with a colleague about how else the city could've spent that money—like to “hire some more people to do personal contact with the different people that we're trying to reach.” 

Companies say they want ethical AI. But those working in the field say that ambition comes at their expense.

City council members were never told exactly how much the effort cost, but in response to questions from MIT Technology Review, Lighthouse, and Trouw on this topic, the city estimated that it had spent some €500,000, plus €35,000 for the contract with Deloitte—but cautioned that the total amount put into the project was only an estimate, given that Smart Check was developed in house by various existing teams and staff members. 

For her part, van der Vliet, the Participation Council member, was not surprised by the poor result. The possibility of a discriminatory computer system was “precisely one of the reasons” her group hadn't wanted the pilot, she says. And as for the discrimination in the existing system? “Yes,” she says, bluntly. “But we have always said that [it was discriminatory].” 

She and other advocates wished that the city had focused more on what they saw as the real problems facing welfare recipients: increases in the cost of living that have not, typically, been followed by increases in benefits; the need to document every change that could potentially affect their benefits eligibility; and the distrust with which they feel they are treated by the municipality. 

When we spoke to Bodaar in March, a year and a half after the end of the pilot, he was candid in his reflections. “Perhaps it was unfortunate to immediately use one of the most complicated systems,” he said, “and perhaps it is also simply the case that it is not yet … the time to use artificial intelligence for this goal.”

“Niente, zero, nada. We're not going to do that anymore,” he said about using AI to evaluate welfare applicants. “But we're still thinking about this: What exactly have we learned?”

That is a question that IJmker thinks about too. In city council meetings she has brought up Smart Check as an example of what not to do. While she was glad that city employees had been thoughtful in their “many protocols,” she worried that the process obscured some of the larger questions of “philosophical” and “political values” that the city had yet to weigh in on as a matter of policy. 

Questions such as “How do we actually look at profiling?” or “What do we think is justified?”—or even “What is bias?” 

These questions are, “where politics comes in, or ethics,” she says, “and that's something you cannot put into a checkbox.”

But now that the pilot has stopped, she worries that her fellow city officials might be too eager to move on. “I think a lot of people were just like, ‘Okay, well, we did this. We're done, bye, end of story,'” she says. It feels like “a waste,” she adds, “because people worked on this for years.”

In abandoning the model, the city has returned to an analog process that its own analysis concluded was biased against women and Dutch nationals—a fact not lost on Berkers, the data scientist, who no longer works for the city. By shutting down the pilot, he says, the city sidestepped the uncomfortable truth—that many of the concerns de Zwart raised about the complex, layered biases within the Smart Check model also apply to the caseworker-led process.

“That's the thing that I find a bit difficult about the decision,” Berkers says. “It's a bit like no decision. It is a decision to go back to the analog process, which in itself has characteristics like bias.” 

Chen, the ethical-AI consultant, largely agrees. “Why do we hold AI systems to a higher standard than human agents?” he asks. When it comes to the caseworkers, he says, “there was no attempt to correct [the bias] systematically.” Amsterdam has promised to write a report on human biases in the welfare process, but the date has been pushed back several times.

“In reality, what ethics comes down to in practice is: nothing's perfect,” he says. “There's a high-level thing of Do not discriminate, which I think we can all agree on, but this example highlights some of the complexities of how you translate that [principle].” Ultimately, Chen believes that finding any solution will require trial and error, which by definition usually involves mistakes: “You have to pay that cost.”

But it may be time to more fundamentally reconsider how fairness should be defined—and by whom. Beyond the mathematical definitions, some researchers argue that the people most affected by the programs in question should have a greater say. “Such systems only work when people buy into them,” explains Elissa Redmiles, an assistant professor of computer science at Georgetown University who has studied algorithmic fairness. 

No matter what the process looks like, these are questions that every government will have to deal with—and urgently—in a future increasingly defined by AI. 

And, as de Zwart argues, if broader questions are not tackled, even well-intentioned officials deploying systems like Smart Check in cities like Amsterdam will be condemned to learn—or ignore—the same lessons over and over. 

“We are being seduced by technological solutions for the wrong problems,” he says. “Should we really want this? Why doesn't the municipality build an algorithm that searches for people who do not apply for social assistance but are entitled to it?”

Herpes zoster (HZ) is common in older people, with a lifetime risk of 25%. The main risk factors are advanced age and immunosuppression. People with a rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease have an overall higher risk for shingles. EULAR - The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology - recommends that HZ vaccination be considered in high-risk patients with an autoimmune and inflammatory RMD. Live vaccines are difficult in patients on immunosuppressive therapies; newer non-live vaccines may replace the live-attenuated version, but when the last recommendations were developed the safety and efficacy of the subunit zoster vaccine had not yet been investigated in patients with RMD.

New work presented at the 2025 annual EULAR congress in Barcelona focuses on the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV), which contains recombinant glycoprotein E - the major target of CD4+T-cells. The abstract describes the tolerability and safety of RZV in patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (iRMD), showcasing interim data from an ongoing study.

In total, 150 adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), or giant cell arteritis (GCA) who had an indication to receive RZV were prospectively included. Of these, 21.3% had a history of HZ, and everyone received RZV at Month 0; 90% also received a dose at Month 2. Safety assessments were performed at Months 2, 3, 6, and 12.

Most adverse events (AE) occurred within a few days after vaccination. In total, 139 (46.8%) localized and 158 (53.2%) generalized AE occurred up to Month 3. At that point, pain at the site of injection was the most frequent AE, reported by 32.7% of patients. This was followed by fever (14.1%), fatigue (9.4%), musculoskeletal pain (8.1%), swelling at the injection site (6.4%) and redness at the injection site (6.4%). Infections (4.7%), worsening of the disease (3.7%) and other AEs (7.7%) were reported until Month 3.

Disease flares were reported by patients at Months 2, 3, 6 and 12, but of these only 1.6-8.6% fulfilled the predefined flare criteria. Hospitalisation due to disease flare was needed for 3 patients - 2 with GCA and 1 with RA. Lead author Uta Kiltz said "over the observed period of 12 months, this can be interpreted as a low rate of events."

Overall, 10 serious AEs were reported in 9 patients during follow-up (3 flares, 4 malignancies, and 3 comorbidities), but no patient reported an AE of special interest or a breakthrough infection. Of note, the malignancies were considered not to be related to the vaccination.

The authors concluded that the majority of patients tolerated RZV well, with only a few reports of flare and serious AEs. These findings are reassuring for rheumatologists and future vaccine recipients, and support confidence in RZV safety for patients with an iRMD.

No more hunger after cooking? A newly identified network of nerve cells is responsible, a research group at the Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research has discovered in mice. They discovered a direct connection from the nose to a group of nerve cells in the brain that are activated by the smell of food and, when activated, trigger a feeling of fullness. This was not the case in obese mice. This discovery suggests that treating obesity might require different advice about smelling food before a meal based on a person's weight. 

The researchers used brain scans to investigate which regions of the mice's brains respond to food odours, and were able to identify a new group of nerve cells in the medial septum of the brain. These nerve cells respond to food in two steps: When the mouse smells food, the nerve cells fire and create a sensation of fullness. This happens within a few seconds because the nerve cells are directly connected to the olfactory bulb. The nerve cells react to different food smells, but not to other smells. When the mice started to eat, the nerve cells were inhibited. Overall, the mice ate less when these nerve cells are active before eating.

We think this mechanism helps mice in the wild protect themselves from predators. By eating for shorter periods, they reduce their chances of being caught."

Janice Bulk, the first author of the study

In obese mice, the same group of nerve cells was not activated when the mice could smell food. The mice did not feel fuller and did not eat less overall. The authors point out that it is already known that obesity disrupts the olfactory system, including neuronal activity in the olfactory bulb. The newly identified group of nerve cells could also be affected by obesity.

The human brain contains the same group of nerve cells as the mouse, but it is not yet known whether they also respond to food odours. Studies by other research groups have shown that smelling some specific odors before a meal can reduce people's appetite. In contrast, other studies have shown that overweight persons eat significantly more in the same situation.

"Our findings highlight how crucial it is to consider the sense of smell in appetite regulation and in the development of obesity. Our study shows how much our daily-lives' eating habits are influenced by the smell of food. Since we discovered that the pathway only reduces appetite in lean mice, but not in obese mice, our study opens up a new way to help prevent overeating in obesity", says Sophie Steculorum, the head of the study and research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research.

Scientists have discovered that certain immune cells — called neutrophils — can start making a protein called DUOX2 that they usually do not produce. This surprise activity may be fuelling gut inflammation in conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

The international study led by Professor Ulla Knaus, UCD School of Medicine and UCD Conway Institute shows this unusual protein production might damage the intestine and make these diseases worse. These surprise findings may lead to a new target for treating inflammatory bowel disease in the future.

Neutrophils are immune cells. They usually help fight infections by attacking bacteria and cleaning up damaged tissues.

DUOX2 is a protein that creates chemicals to repel germs but can also damage the body if there is too much of it. Normally, neutrophils do not contain DUOX2 but in people with gut disease, some neutrophils start making this protein (called 'de novo' expression).

Our findings show that the new DUOX2 protein can lead to too many reactive chemicals being produced, which causes inflammation in the gut. This makes the disease worse. The gut can get more irritated, leading to more pain, diarrhoea, and long-term problems. If we can stop neutrophils from making DUOX2 or discover inhibitors, it might help clinicians to treat gut inflammation in the future."

Dr. Ashish Singh, postdoctoral researcher and first author

Prof. Knaus said, "Interestingly, we have seen early indications in our research that neutrophil DUOX may also be a promising therapeutic target in acute inflammation across other organs as well. This presents a breakthrough for drug discovery in neutrophil-driven inflammatory diseases."

This international collaboration included University of California; the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, U.S.A. as well as academic and clinical colleagues across Ireland. The research findings are published online in the scientific journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2421747122).

A new study from Karolinska Institutet involving over a million women links difficult childhood experiences to the risk of being diagnosed with endometriosis later in life. The study shows a link between childhood exposure to violence and a twofold increase in the risk of developing this gynecological disease.

Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. These cells attach to the abdominal lining, uterus, ovaries or other organs and form endometriosis lesions. The lesions react to sex hormones and bleed during menstruation, leading to pain and inflammation that can cause adhesions between organs, which increases the pain.

Although endometriosis, which affects one in ten women, is a relatively common disease, its causes are still not fully understood. A new study published in the journal Human Reproduction has now identified a link between different types of difficult childhood experiences and an increased risk of developing endometriosis.

The study included more than 1.3 million women born in Sweden between 1974 and 2001. Of these, more than 24,000 were diagnosed with endometriosis. The researchers used data from several national registers to map the women's childhood conditions. Factors such as having parents with mental illness, substance abuse, financial problems or intellectual disabilities, having a teenage parent, death in the family, and being exposed to or subjected to violence and sexual abuse were examined.

The results showed that all factors examined, except death in the family, were linked to an increased risk of endometriosis. Experiencing any of these risk factors was linked to a 20 per cent increased risk of endometriosis diagnosis compared to women who had not been exposed.

We also saw that the more adverse experiences in childhood, the higher the risk. Among those who had five or more factors, the risk increased to 60 per cent."

Marika Rostvall, study's first author, physician and doctoral student at the Department of Global Public Health, Karolinska Institutet

The strongest link was observed in children who had been exposed to violence. These children had more than twice the risk of developing endometriosis later in life compared to women who had not been exposed.

"The results suggest that early life experiences can affect the body's health much later in life and highlight the importance of looking at the whole person, not just the symptoms. The findings are also in line with previous research showing that difficulties in childhood have profound consequences for future health," says Marika Rostvall.

Research has not yet established the link between difficult childhood experiences and endometriosis, but Marika Rostvall highlights two possible explanations.

"One explanation is that stress during childhood can affect the immune system, which could prevent it from effectively eliminating endometriosis tissue.

Another explanation is that trauma during childhood could affect the body's sensitivity to pain, which can lead to increased pain and thus a higher likelihood of being diagnosed with endometriosis," says Marika Rostvall, continuing:

"I hope that the findings can be used to improve both preventive measures and treatment in healthcare.

As the study is observational, it is not possible to draw conclusions about causal relationships.

The study is a collaboration between Karolinska Institutet and the Centre for Epidemiology and Community Medicine (CES), Region Stockholm. The study was funded by Karolinska Institutet and Region Stockholm. Kristina Gemzell-Danielsson has been invited as an expert and speaker to several companies unrelated to the current study.

Major changes could be in store for the more than 24 million people with health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, including how and when they can enroll, the paperwork required, and, crucially, the premiums they pay.

A driver behind these changes is the "One Big Beautiful Bill," the name given to spending and tax legislation designed to advance the policy agenda of President Donald Trump. It passed the House on May 22 and is pending in the Senate.

The changes also would come from regulations the Trump administration proposed in March and the potential expiration of larger premium subsidies put in place during the covid-19 pandemic.

Millions of people might drop or lose coverage by 2034 as a result, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

Combined, the moves by Trump and his allies could "devastate access" to ACA plans, said Katie Keith, director of the Center for Health Policy and the Law at the O'Neill Institute, a health policy research group at Georgetown University.

States that run their own Obamacare marketplaces and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners have also raised concerns about added costs and reduced access. But House Republicans and some conservative think tanks say the ACA needs revamping to rein in fraud, part of which they pin on certain Biden administration changes the measures would undo.

Senate Republicans must now weigh whether to include the House's proposals in their own bill, with the aim of getting it through the chamber by July 4.

Here are four key ways Trump's policies could undermine Obamacare enrollment and coverage.

The House-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which runs more than 1,000 pages, would create paperwork requirements that could delay access to tax credits for some enrollees, potentially raising the cost of their insurance.

More than 90% of ACA enrollees receive tax credits to defray monthly premiums for their coverage. There are two key provisions for them to watch.

One would end automatic reenrollment for most ACA policyholders each year. More than 10 million people were automatically reenrolled in their coverage for the 2025 plan year, with their eligibility for tax credits confirmed via a system that allows ACA marketplaces to check government or other data sources.

The House bill would instead require every new or returning policyholder each year to provide information on income, household size, immigration status, and other factors, starting in 2028. If they don't, they won't get a premium tax credit, which could put the price of coverage out of reach.

"Everyone who wants to either purchase or renew a marketplace plan will have to come with a shoebox filled with documents, scan in and upload them or mail them in, and sit and wait while someone reviews and confirms them," said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.

She and other policy experts fear that many consumers will become uninsured because they don't understand the requirements or find them burdensome. If too many young and healthy people, for example, decide it's not worth the hassle, that could leave more older and sicker people for ACA insurers to cover — potentially raising premiums for everyone.

But supporters of the House bill say the current approach needs changing because it is vulnerable to waste, fraud, and abuse.

"This would ensure that enrollees need to return to the exchange to update their information and obtain an updated eligibility determination for a subsidy — best protecting the public against excess subsidies paid to insurers that can never be recovered," the conservative Paragon Institute wrote in an April letter to top Department of Health and Human Services officials.

Today, people who experience life changes — losing a job, getting married or divorced, or having a baby, for instance — are considered provisionally eligible for tax credits to reduce their premiums if they sign up or change their ACA plans. That means they would be eligible to receive these subsidies for at least 90 days while their applications are checked against government data or other sources, or marketplaces follow up with requests for additional information.

The House bill would end that, requiring documentation before receiving tax credits. That could create particular hardship for new parents, who can't confirm that babies are eligible for premium subsidies until they receive Social Security numbers weeks after they're born.

Policy experts following the debate "did not expect the end to provisional eligibility," Corlette said. "I don't know what the reaction in the Senate will be, as I'm not sure everyone understands the full implications of these provisions because they are so new."

It can take up to six weeks for the Social Security Administration to process a number for a newborn, and an additional two weeks for parents to get the card, according to a white paper that analyzed provisions of the House bill and was co-authored by Jason Levitis, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, and Christen Linke Young, a visiting fellow with Brookings' Center on Health Policy.

Without a Social Security number, any application to add a newborn to an ACA policy would automatically generate a hold on premium tax credits for that family, they wrote — increasing their out-of-pocket costs, at least temporarily.

"It puts consumers on the hook for any delays the marketplace is taking," while the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which administers the ACA marketplaces, "is cutting staff and adding a lot more paperwork to burden the staff they have," Levitis said.

Provisions in the House bill that would require ACA enrollees to provide information each year that they reenroll — or when seeking to add or change a policy due to a life circumstance — would increase the number of people without health insurance by 700,000 in 2034, according to the latest CBO estimate.

The House bill would turn into law a Trump proposal to shorten the ACA open enrollment period. The start date would continue to be Nov. 1. But the window would be shortened by about a month, with an end date of Dec. 15. This affects people in states that use the federal marketplace as well as the 19 states and the District of Columbia that run their own, most of which offer open enrollment into at least mid-January.

Also, as soon as the end of this year, a special enrollment period the Biden administration created would be done away with. It allowed people with lower incomes — those who earn up to 1.5 times the 2024 federal poverty level, or about $38,730 for a family of three — to sign up anytime during the year.

Critics, including the Paragon Institute, argue that this enrollment opening led to fraud, partly blaming it for a steep increase last year in instances of insurance agents seeking commissions by enrolling or switching consumers into plans without their consent, or fudging their incomes to qualify them for tax credits so large they paid no monthly premiums at all.

But supporters — including some states that run their own ACA exchange — say there are other ways to address fraud.

"We anticipate that much of the improper activity can be prevented by security and integrity upgrades to the federal marketplace, which we understand the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is implementing," the National Association of Insurance Commissioners wrote in a May 29 letter to congressional leaders.

The reason? Enhanced tax credits created during the pandemic expire at the end of the year. The House bill doesn't extend them. Those more generous payments are credited with helping double ACA enrollment since 2020.

The CBO estimates that extending the subsidies would cost $335 billion over 10 years. The House bill instead funds an extension of Trump's tax cuts, which largely benefit wealthier families.

If the enhanced credits are allowed to expire, not only would premium subsidies be smaller for many people, but there would also be an abrupt eligibility cutoff — an income cliff — for households above four times the federal poverty rate, or about $103,280 for a family of three for this plan year.

Taking into account the smaller subsidies and the cliff, KFF estimates a national average premium increase of 75% for enrollees if the enhanced subsidies expire. The CBO expects that about 4.2 million more people will be uninsured in 2034 as a result.

Developmentally expressed genes play a fundamental role in the formation of a wide range of organs. The Y chromosome-located mammalian sex-determining gene Sry, required for the formation of testis, is activated only within a narrow time window during embryogenesis. However, the processes behind the activation of Sry remain uncertain.

Now, in a recent publication from Nature, a team from The University of Osaka has discovered that iron plays a crucial role in male mammalian sex development.

The Sry gene directs sexually undifferentiated gonads to differentiate into testes rather than ovaries. The Sry gene is initially inactive because of a modification added to DNA-wrapping proteins called histone methylation. In males, a protein called KDM3A is responsible for removing this histone methylation, allowing the Sry gene to become active.

We already knew that KDM3A requires iron for its enzymatic activity. Therefore, we wanted to investigate the extent and nature of iron metabolism and histone demethylation in sex determination."

Naoki Okashita, lead author

The researchers established mice lacking Tfrc, a gene crucial for cellular iron incorporation. Loss of Tfrc prevented the removal of the histone methylation, leading to reduced Sry expression. When inspecting the genitals of these mice, it was found that some XY mice developed as female, despite being genetically male.

The team also established an organ culture system for gonadal cells in which they could manipulate the levels of available iron. This confirmed that iron deficiency reduces the activity of KDM3A and activation of Sry. Therefore, the reduced Sry suppression under iron-deficient conditions was caused by the failure of KDM3A to remove histone methylation.

Perhaps most significantly, they then showed that maternal iron deficiency - whether induced by diet or by pharmacological intervention - could lead to altered histone methylation of the Sry gene because of reduced KDM3A activity. Some population of XY offspring derived from iron-deficient pregnant females were shown to undergo male-to-female sex reversal, potentially due to the impaired Sry activation.

"Our findings indicate that iron deficiency leads to disorders of male development, at least in mice. Our study emphasizes the importance of maintaining maternal iron levels," explains senior author, Makoto Tachibana.

It is known that in humans, Fanconi anemia and Diamond-Blackfan anemia are risk factors for disorders of development. Understanding how iron supports embryonic development underscores the importance of maternal iron intake for the healthy development of human embryos.

The International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) Embryo Models Working Group has released updated recommendations for the oversight and regulation of stem cell-based embryo models (SCBEM), aiming to address rapid advancements and ensure responsible scientific progress. The proposed recommendations are detailed in a new paper published today in Stem Cell Reports.

SCBEMs are three dimensional structures that replicate key aspects of early embryonic development, offering unprecedented potential to enhance our understanding of human developmental biology and reproductive science.

Stem cell-based embryo models are poised to revolutionize our understanding of early human development and improve clinical practices in assisted reproduction. However, as these models advance, it is crucial that they are studied in a framework that balances scientific progress with ethical, legal, and social considerations. These proposed recommendations are designed to foster innovation while at the same time providing regulatory guidance for key stakeholders in this vital area of biomedical research."

Amander Clark, University of California, Los Angeles, USA, co-chair of the ISSCR Embryo Models Working Group and an expert in human stem cell and reproductive science

Janet Rossant, CC, PhD, world-renowned expert in developmental biology and co-chair of the ISSCR Embryo Models Working Group stated, "Given the acceleration of these technologies, it was important to convene a working group to evaluate whether the existing ISSCR Guidelines should be amended to keep pace with new advances."

The recommendations outlined in the paper, Stem cell-based embryo models: the 2021 ISSCR stem cell guidelines revisited, address recent scientific breakthroughs that enable the creation of increasingly complex models efficiently and without reliance on major extraembryonic lineages. The group made three central recommendations:

The paper also recommends the removal of the distinction between integrated and non-integrated models. These modifications aim to bring clarity to the emerging field, guide the deliberations of researchers, oversight committees, and stakeholders, and ensure the continued confidence of the public in the responsible advancement of SCBEM research.

The co-chairs will present the proposed recommendations in June to the ISSCR Board of Directors as part of a targeted update to the 2021 ISSCR Guidelines for Stem Cell Research and Clinical Translation.

In a revealing Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, Sara Poletti, PhD, senior researcher at IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele Milan, illuminates the profound connections between childhood adversity and lifelong vulnerability to psychiatric disorders through persistent neuroinflammation pathways and alterations in brain structure.

Dr. Poletti's groundbreaking research has transformed understanding of how early life experiences become biologically embedded, creating lasting changes in brain structure and immune function. As the only tenure-track psychologist in psychiatry at her institute, she has pioneered multidisciplinary approaches that combine neuroimaging, genetic analysis, and immunological markers to decode the biological signatures of childhood trauma.

The immune system doesn't just fight infections-it plays a crucial role in shaping our mental health throughout life. Childhood trauma can fundamentally reprogram these immune responses, creating vulnerability to depression, bipolar disorder, and other psychiatric conditions decades later."

Sara Poletti, PhD, senior researcher at IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele Milan

Her work raises critical questions about prevention and intervention: Can we identify biological markers of trauma early enough to prevent psychiatric disorders? How do protective factors buffer against neuroinflammatory responses? What role does timing play in trauma's biological impact? These questions drive Dr. Poletti's innovative research program.

Dr. Poletti's path to neuroscience began with a childhood microscope and evolved through encounters with Freud's writings and neuroimaging studies of violent criminals. This eclectic background equipped her with unique perspectives on brain-behavior relationships. Despite warnings that psychedelic and inflammation research was "career suicide" in 2006, she persisted in exploring these then-marginalized areas that have since become central to psychiatric research.

As Project Leader at San Raffaele's Psychiatry and Clinical Psychobiology Unit, Dr. Poletti coordinates diverse teams of psychologists, physicians, and biologists. Her leadership of a European Research Area Network (ERA-NET) Neuron project on the consequences of infections on mental health exemplifies her ability to foster international collaboration in advancing inflammation's role in psychiatric disorders.

One defining moment in Dr. Poletti's career came when she reluctantly accepted a teaching position in human physiology-a field she knew little about. "It required extensive studying and put me to the test," she recalls. "However, I learned a great deal from this experience, both scientifically and personally." This challenge deepened her understanding of body-brain interactions, proving invaluable for her later research on neuroinflammation.

Her resilience in facing academic challenges mirrors the resilience she studies in trauma survivors. Some individuals exposed to severe childhood adversity develop psychiatric disorders while others don't-understanding these differences could revolutionize preventive psychiatry. What biological factors confer resilience? How can we enhance natural protective mechanisms? Dr. Poletti's research addresses these fundamental questions.

Dr. Poletti's findings have immediate clinical relevance. By identifying specific inflammatory markers associated with childhood trauma, her work provides potential targets for novel interventions. This precision medicine approach could transform psychiatric treatment from symptom management to addressing underlying biological mechanisms. Following this line of reasoning she published the first paper on the use of an immunomodulatory agent (interleukin 2) to treat mood disorders.

"I aim to further elucidate the role of the immune system and its interaction with the environment in psychiatric disorders," Dr. Poletti states. Her vision includes developing prevention strategies to reduce mental illness odds, particularly for individuals with trauma histories. This preventive focus represents a paradigm shift from reactive to proactive psychiatric care.

The interview reveals how Dr. Poletti's passion for Italian mountain hiking informs her scientific approach. Standing atop Sasso Nero at 2,847 meters, she finds the clarity and renewal that fuel her research endeavors. This connection to nature reflects her holistic view of mental health, recognizing that human wellbeing extends beyond biological mechanisms to encompass environmental and experiential factors.

Questions about trauma's transgenerational effects add another dimension to Dr. Poletti's work. Can childhood trauma alter genetic expression in ways that affect offspring? How do social and cultural factors modulate biological responses to adversity? These considerations expand the scope of trauma research from individual to societal levels.

Dr. Poletti's research contributes to a growing recognition that mental health is inseparable from physical health, particularly immune function. This integrated perspective challenges traditional boundaries between psychiatry and other medical specialties, promoting more comprehensive approaches to patient care.

The implications extend beyond individual treatment. If childhood trauma creates lasting biological vulnerabilities, what responsibilities do societies have for preventing adverse childhood experiences? How can healthcare systems better integrate trauma screening and early intervention? Dr. Poletti's work provides scientific grounding for these critical policy discussions.

Dr. Sara Poletti's Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today's most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist's impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.

Could a simple fiber supplement curb hunger and keep insulin in check? New research finds that this mineral-rich blend helps people feel fuller without raising blood sugar levels.

Study: Impact of a mineral enriched, fiber complex on glycaemic response and satiation in healthy adults: a double-blind, crossover intervention study. Image Credit: superbeststock / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the European Journal of Nutrition, researchers investigated the effects of a mineral-enriched fiber complex on satiation and glycemic response. Obesity and overweight have become a significant global health concern and pose substantial economic challenges to global healthcare systems. Excessive fat accumulation is a significant risk factor for various metabolic disorders. Weight gain in early adulthood is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and CVD mortality, compared to that in later life. This suggests the need for early interventions to support weight management and alleviate risks.

Efforts to maintain a healthy weight can be challenging. Recent anti-obesity strategies have been revolutionized by glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists. However, these interventions often have undesirable effects, such as diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. Therefore, given the risks, limitations, and suitability of pharmaceutical approaches, functional foods and supplements could be a beneficial alternative.

In the present study, researchers investigated the impact of chromium-enriched glucomannan-fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) complex, i.e., SlimBiome (SB), intake on satiety and glycemic response in healthy adults. This randomized, crossover intervention trial recruited healthy adults aged 18–65, with normal fasting glucose levels and body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 kg/m² and 24.9 kg/m². Subjects made three visits to the laboratory.

The first was a screening and familiarization visit. Blood pressure, body fat percentage, and anthropometric indices were measured at the first visit. Participants were required to fast for 12 hours before each visit and refrain from consuming large meals and alcohol the previous day. Visits 2 and 3 were completed in a randomized order with a washout period of at least two days between them. A modified oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at visits 2 and 3.

Blood was collected to measure fasting glucose and insulin levels. Participants consumed a dextrose drink at visit 2 or an SB plus dextrose (SBD) drink at visit 3, following which blood samples were collected at several time points (up to 2.5 hours) after intake. In addition, participants completed a questionnaire on subjective measures of appetite at 0 (baseline), 75, and 150 minutes post-intake; responses were recorded on the visual analog scale (VAS).

A rapid viscoanalyzer was used to assess the viscosity kinetics of SB, SBD, and dextrose under gastric pH conditions. The area under the curve for insulin (AUCins) and glucose (AUCglu) was calculated. Further, insulin sensitivity was calculated using the Matsuda and Cederholm indices. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed to examine differences in insulin and glucose levels between the interventions (SBD and dextrose).

The study recruited eight females and eight males. Blood glucose levels remained unchanged and were not significantly different between dextrose and SBD conditions at any time during OGTT. Notably, plasma insulin levels were significantly lower 45, 75, and 90 minutes after SBD intake compared to those after dextrose intake. Importantly, early insulin response (within 30 minutes) showed no significant difference between interventions. AUCins was significantly lower with SBD compared to dextrose, but AUCglu was not significantly different between conditions.

Glucose levels were significantly higher at 75 minutes and lower at 150 minutes post-intake than at baseline in both conditions. Meanwhile, insulin levels were higher at 75 minutes than at baseline with both interventions. Insulin values at baseline and 150 minutes were not different with either intervention.

Baseline VAS scores did not differ significantly between the dextrose and SBD conditions. However, significant increases were observed over time in the amount of food desired and hunger between baseline and 150 minutes upon dextrose intake. On the other hand, SBD intake significantly increased fullness 75 minutes post-intake.

Crucially, at 150 minutes post-intake (but not earlier), subjects reported being significantly less hungry and fuller with SBD than with dextrose across all appetite metrics (including desire to eat and amount of food desired). SBD and SB attained maximum viscosity between 15 and 20 minutes and stabilized thereafter. The viscosity of dextrose was significantly lower than that of SBD and SB. However, there were no differences between SB and SBD.

The researchers noted that chromium levels (15 µg/dose) were likely too low to drive effects, suggesting benefits primarily stem from fibers' viscosity-related mechanisms. As an acute study, long-term effects remain unexplored.

In summary, SBD significantly reduced insulin levels at 45, 75, and 90 minutes, as well as AUCins at 150 minutes post-intake, compared to dextrose, without affecting glucose levels. This underscores the potential beneficial impact of SB on postprandial insulin response. SBD intake resulted in later-occurring (150 min) lower sensations of hunger and increased fullness. These findings offer valuable insights and suggest the potential use of SB in weight management strategies, though longer-term studies are needed to confirm effects.

Human metabolism is a complex web of chemical processes and interactions between our cells and the microbes living within us. The more scientists can identify and classify the molecules involved in our metabolism, called metabolites, the more we can learn about human health and disease. Now, researchers at University of California San Diego have made a major advance in our understanding of human metabolism by describing hundreds of new N-acyl lipids, a type of molecule involved in immune and stress responses.

The main findings of the study, published in Cell, were:

Metabolites are the language that the body uses to communicate with itself and with our microbiome, and studying them can offer significant insight into the role of microbial metabolism in health and disease. It's like we've added hundreds of new words to the metabolic dictionary."

Pieter Dorrestein, Ph.D., senior author, professor at UC San Diego Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Departments of Pharmacology and Pediatrics at UC San Diego School of Medicine

Human metabolism is a delicate system, and imbalances in metabolism have been linked to a wide range of diseases, including diabetes, cancer and neurological disorders. For decades, much of the underlying biochemistry of human metabolism, including the role of the human microbiome, has gone unknown, making it harder to understand and treat diseases related to metabolism.

The hundreds of new compounds help fill this knowledge gap.

"The big surprise here was how diverse this group of compounds actually is," said first author Helena Mannochio Russo, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in Dorrestein's lab.

Within the previously unknown molecules, the researchers found that many were found in the digestive tract and contained short-chain fatty acids, a known hallmark of microbial metabolism. The distribution pattern of these molecules also varied based on diet, microbial colonization, and in people with diseases that impact the microbiome, such as diabetes. Together, these findings suggest that the newly-identified metabolites are produced by the human microbiome.

The researchers also found that these microbial metabolites were associated with HIV status and cognitive impairment, suggesting a potential link between the gut microbiome and neurological function in individuals with HIV. However, it will take more research to fully understand the implications of this connection of the gut microbes language and how they affect cognition.

"There's so much we can learn from existing data, and the more we utilize reverse metabolomics, the more we'll be able to learn about how the microbiome interacts with us and impacts our health, and the faster we'll be able to learn from it," added Mannochio Russo. "This is just the beginning."

A new study from Emory University addresses the growing global crisis of antibiotic-resistant infections. Many of these drug-resistant bacteria are spread through hospitals, and there are few antibiotics available for treatment.

The study, published in PNAS, looks at a particular bacterium called Acinetobacter baumannii, which is highly infectious, spread mostly in hospitals and typically infects immunocompromised patients. The researchers employed an entirely new strategy to identify weaknesses specific to resistant bacteria and then target these weaknesses with an alternate drug. They found that fendiline, a drug that acts as a calcium channel blocker and formerly used to treat heart arrhythmia kills the bacterium by targeting the essential lipoprotein trafficking pathway, which is weakened in antibiotic resistant bacteria.

It's critical that we find more and better therapeutics that can target these antibiotic-resistant infections which affect patients on ventilators, those with deep soft tissue infections, and the immunocompromised."

Philip Rather, PhD, corresponding author on the paper and professor, Emory University School of Medicine

"This novel finding repurposes an existing drug, exploits a newly identified vulnerability in an antibiotic-resistant bacterium, and opens doors for developing new antibiotics targeting similar pathways," says Jennifer Colquhoun, PhD, first author and research scientist at Emory University.

Breaking News Reporter

U.S. Customs and Border Protection says it will be “suited and booted” at FIFA Club World Cup games across the country this summer. 

The agency, which operates under Homeland Security and its secretary, Kristi Noem, confirmed on social media that it will be present and “ready to provide security for the first round of games.”

The competition's first match is scheduled for Saturday evening between Lionel Messi-led Inter Miami and Egypt's Al-Ahly in South Florida. The next matches will be in the Los Angeles area, Seattle, Cincinnati, and New Jersey on Sunday.

CBP shared its statement on Tuesday but deleted it the following morning. The deletion added to confusion about the role federal agents may have at venues, at a time when there is increased tension between the public and immigration authorities. 

“Let the games begin!” CBP's post reads. “The first FIFA Club World Cup games start on June 14th in Miami… CBP will be suited and booted and ready to provide security for the first round of games.” 

ICE confirmed that it received a request from the Daily Beast seeking additional details, but did not provide clarification on the role federal agents will play during the competition.

DHS and CBP did not immediately respond to questions emailed by the Daily Beast.

Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst at the Florida Immigrant Coalition, told NBC Miami that the presence of federal agents may keep people from attending matches, both U.S.-based fans and the tens of thousands initially expected to visit from abroad. 

There are already some examples of ICE tensions canceling fans' plans, as one Boston-based supporter of the Brazilian club Flamengo said his supporter group has called off its public watch parties over fears of an immigration sweep.

“The messaging that CBP is using is a bit cryptic; it's sort of alluding that people should have their paperwork in order to attend the games,” Kennedy said. “It creates an environment where people are less likely to come watch the games because of just sheer intimidation.”

FIFA is reportedly having a tough time selling tickets to the tournament as is. The cheapest tickets to its opening match in Miami Gardens have been slashed from costing $349 when they first went on sale last year to as cheap as $55 last week, with more than 10,000 seats still unsold, Reuters reported. Tickets to see European Champions Paris Saint-Germain face the Brazilian giants Botafogo at the Rose Bowl remain as cheap as $33.45.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has visited host cities and promised that “the world will be welcomed.” The tournament features 12 clubs from Europe, six from South America, five from North America, four each from Africa and Asia, and a single club from New Zealand.

Canada Men's National Team manager Jesse Marsch, an American national, said he fears foreign tourists will not feel safe in America during MAGA 2.0.

“I could see trepidation for anyone looking to travel to the U.S. at this current political climate,” he said. “So it's a sad thing, I think, that we have to talk about visiting the U.S. in this way, but I think everybody has to make decisions that are best for them and that fit best with what's going on in their life and their lifestyle.”

The tournament is widely regarded as a dry run for the U.S. ahead of next year's larger and more prestigious FIFA World Cup in the country. Trump has acknowledged the importance of this summer's competition and even created a position to oversee it, but handed that gig to Rudy Giuliani's son, who has no background in soccer. 

Vice President JD Vance's comments about the competition also may have rubbed traveling fans the wrong way. 

“Of course, everyone is welcome to come and see this wonderful event,” Vance said at a White House event last month. “We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the games. But when the time is up, we want them to go home; otherwise, they will have to talk to Secretary Noem.”

Tyler Adams says the U.S. soccer team has tuned out criticism from former players.

Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey, who share the American goals record with 57 each, are among those who have been critical of current regulars not in the struggling roster preparing for the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

"We don't talk about that internally as a group," Adams said Wednesday during a Zoom interview with The Associated Press. "The noise on the outside is the noise on the outside. I think we need to focus on what we need to do as a group and continue to build."

Star Christian Pulisic is skipping the June camp and Gold Cup to rest after playing about 120 games for club and country over two seasons.

"Whether it was Gold Cup, whether it was Copa (America), whether it was Confederations Cup, whether it was the World Cup, I wasn't going to miss competitions," Dempsey said last week on the "Men in Blazers" podcast. "For me, I don't understand it because that wasn't my mentality. I always wanted to play in those games."

Watching Portugal celebrate its win over Spain in Sunday's European Nations League final, Donovan said on the Fox postgame show: "I can't help but think about our guys on vacation not wanting to play in Gold Cup."

Pulisic has not spoken publicly of his decision.

The U.S. has lost four straight games, its longest skid since 2007, following a 4-0 rout Tuesday night by Switzerland.

"This is part of the process," Adams said. "You're going to win games. You're going to lose games. It's about continuing to build that. I think we're on the right path. We have to continue to build and try the things that we've been training. It'll take a little bit of time, but it will come together."

Adams didn't dress for the Switzerland friendly but is confident he will be ready for the Gold Cup, where the Americans open Sunday against Trinidad and Tobago.

"A little turf toe-type injury. More of an overuse thing probably than anything — overload. It was something that I picked up when I came into camp," Adams said. "Progressing well right now, but just trying to be smart and manage it."

Adams, who captained the U.S. at the 2022 World Cup, funded a pair of mini-pitches at Pulaski Park in Poughkeepsie, New York, near his home in Wappinger. He spoke on the Zoom about his work with Allstate, the U.S. Soccer Foundation and Black Star Soccer to construct fields about the size of basketball courts at the Fisher Magnet Upper Academy in Detroit and The Bell Avenue School in Yeadon, Pennsylvania.

"Before the World Cup hopefully we plan to do one more with a city unnamed yet," Adams said. "It's something that I think has real impact, continues to grow the sport, serves underserved communities."

Now 26, Adams is feeling back to his old self. He had back surgery last July with Dr. Robert Watkins and returned to the field with England's Bournemouth on Oct. 26. Adams played in 28 Premier League matches this season after being limited to three in 2023-24 because of leg injuries.

"It's definitely enjoyable when you're healthy," he said. "The 16-to-18 months that it was just on and off inconsistency is something I never had in my career and never had to battle. And then when it hits you and you go through that, you just learn different ways to navigate things, enjoy life, just not take things for granted, all the little things."

Since Mauricio Pochettino took over as U.S. coach last fall, players have had more autonomy to break away from rigid positioning employed by his predecessor, Gregg Berhalter.

"From a positional standpoint, obviously we had probably a little bit of a different structure under Gregg," Adams said. "Maurizio gives the players freedom to find spots they're comfortable in and see how they can affect the game in different ways. I think our attacking players definitely have freedom to try and find the ball and create things in the right areas of the field. So, yeah, I think he gives everyone freedom, but there's still structure to the way that we want to play."

Adams will be with the U.S. team in Austin, Texas, next Wednesday, and following intently when the Premier League releases its 2025-26 schedule at 3 a.m. CDT. He feels improved because of his time with Leeds in 2022-23 and Bournemouth the past two seasons.

"After you play in the Premier League, every game feels slow,'" he said. "No matter what game I play in now the game feels slow. You look at your schedule when the season comes out and you have to play in a row Arsenal, Tottenham, Man City, Liverpool, Manchester United, all these big games back to back to back you just learn how to make decisions quicker and if you don't, you get punished."

Big clubs concerned they are missing out financially

Winners could be paid more than £90m

Fifa will hold a consultation about expanding the Club World Cup to 48 teams in 2029 if this summer's edition is successful, after lobbying from clubs who failed to qualify for the new $1bn (£740m) tournament.

The 32-team competition kicks off in the US on Saturday and the winners will receive up to $125.8m (£93.2m) in participation and prize money for playing seven matches. That is about £25m less than Paris Saint-Germain banked from Uefa for their 17-game Champions League-winning campaign, leading to concerns from clubs who have missed out.

Barcelona, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Milan are among the big clubs with large fanbases who have not qualified and unless Fifa lifts its cap of 12 European entrants, expansion is the only way to ensure more European competitors.

Next year's men's World Cup and the 2031 Women's World Cup will involve 48 teams for the first time, so expanding the Club World Cup would be consistent with Fifa's new tournament model. Fifa sources said that although serious discussions regarding expansion had yet to take place, talks with all stakeholders about the Club World Cup's format and structure would be held after this summer's tournament.

Another possible change being pushed by Premier League clubs is increasing the cap of two clubs from one country, a restriction that led to Liverpool missing out despite meeting one of the qualifying criteria of having one of the best eight Champions League records of clubs who did not win the competition between 2021 and 2024. Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid qualified as Champions League winners during that period, with nine European clubs qualifying through Uefa rankings because Madrid won the competition twice, in 2022 and 2024.

Fifa has waived the two-per-country limit for clubs that won their continental competition in that period, leading to Brazil having four clubs from four successive Copa Libertadores victories.

The US have three clubs taking part after Los Angeles beat the Mexican side Club América in a playoff triggered by the expulsion of Club León for a breach of multi-club ownership rules.

In an interview with the Athletic last week Fifa's general secretary, Mattias Grafström, said all options were open for 2029. “For the future we are very open-minded to look at formats and so on that we will discuss with the clubs and with the confederations,” he said. “I believe strongly in the future of this competition.”

Expanding the Club World Cup would be well received in particular by European clubs, whose commercial strength and global popularity are not reflected in this year's entry list. A bigger tournament involving more of the bigger European clubs would also suit Fifa, which initially struggled to sell commercial deals for the competition.

Dazn agreed to pay $1bn for global TV rights in a deal that allows it to sublicense to other broadcasters on a regional basis, with Channel 5 buying the rights for 23 matches in the UK.

The Dazn deal is being funded by a 10% investment in the company by Saudi Arabia's SURJ Sports Investment and Saudi money is underpinning the tournament, with the country's Public Investment Fund announced as tournament partners last week. The longtime Fifa sponsors Adidas, Coca-Cola and Visa have also come on board after initially resisting. Ticket sales have been mixed, however.

Expansion would be resisted by the international players' union, Fifpro, which along with the lobby group European Leagues has filed a legal complaint to the European Commission accusing Fifa of “abuse of dominance” for allegedly failing to consult them over the scheduling of the tournament.

Fifa has denied the allegations and accused some leagues of “commercial self-interest” and “hypocrisy”. The European Commission has yet to decide whether to investigate the complaint.

Unsurprisingly given their domination of the UEFA Champions League in the 21st century, Real Madrid are record five-time winners of the FIFA Club World Cup.

However, such an impressive history in the competition will matter little heading into this summer's reformatted and expanded iteration of the tournament, with 32 teams from across all six continental federations fighting for world champion status. 

Madrid will undoubtedly be among the leading candidates to win the competition in its rebirth year, owing largely to their ludicrously talented squad. Despite a difficult 2024–25 season, there can be no doubting the immense talent Los Blancos boast. 

But who will be on the plane to the United States? Let's take a closer look. 

Competing clubs must travel with 26 to 35 players and Madrid submitted their official squad list on June 10 after the summer's first transfer window slammed shut. 

The Spanish giants will have an extra opportunity to add to their roster midway through the tournament, with another registration period spanning between June 27 and 3 July. In this time Madrid will be able to add no more than six players, including two that won't contribute to their final 35-man squad list. 

However, Madrid won't be able to register any players who have already competed at the tournament for another club, such as Benfica's Álvaro Carreras who is a transfer target for Los Blancos. 

Madrid have confirmed their 34-man squad for the Club World Cup, with a host of injured stars returning to the team, new signings featuring and a number of youngsters making the cut for clashes with Al Hilal, Pachuca and Salzburg.

Madrid will not only travel to the U.S. with several new players in their squad, they will jet off under new management. Xabi Alonso will oversee his first matches in charge of the club at the tournament having taken over from Carlo Ancelotti, with the Spaniard, who used to play for Los Blancos, wanting to hit the ground running. 

Alonso's first acquisitions since taking the Madrid job have been impressive, with Trent Alexander-Arnold poached from another one of his former clubs, Liverpool. The right back is currently on international duty with England but has been named in the Club World Cup squad after an agreement was reached with the Reds, who will pocket as much as £10 million ($13.5 million) by letting the defender end his contract early. 

Another Premier League defender who has teamed up with Madrid is Dean Huijsen. The former Bournemouth starlet helps ease issues at center back for Alonso and will travel to the Club World Cup. The 20-year-old will need a little time to recover after recently losing the UEFA Nations League final with Spain. 

Injuries threatened to be Madrid's greatest hurdle at the Club World Cup but a host of long-term absentees have been named in Alonso's squad. How much they can feature at the tournament remains to be seen, though. 

Éder Militão, David Alaba, Dani Carvajal, Ferland Mendy and Antonio Rüdiger have all returned in defense, while Eduardo Camavinga is available in midfield and Endrick in the forward line. The latter appeared certain to miss the trip to the United States with a hamstring injury. 

Despite their contracts expiring at the end of June, both Luka Modric and Lucas Vázquez will represent Madrid at the tournament for their final appearances before departures. Jesús Vallejo is also leaving for free at the end of the month but will not travel to the United States.

Following the U.S. Men's National Team's fourth consecutive loss on Tuesday, falling 4-0 to Switzerland, former international Alexi Lalas suggested that U.S. Soccer may be starting to panic.

Just a year away from the FIFA World Cup, which will be held in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT has continued to struggle to show any form of identity or cohesive vision on the field.

Losses to Panama and Canada at the CONCACAF Nations League Finals in March prompted heavy criticism from fans and former players alike, with many left questioning the desire of this generation of stars.

Now with a 2-1 loss to Turkey and a 4-0 loss to Switzerland under their belts as they head for the Gold Cup - the first time the USMNT has lost four straight games since 2007 - Lalas believes there must be some serious concerns regarding Pochettino, who was appointed in September, within the Federation.

“Ultimately, for someone like Pochettino, if he were to coach all the way through next summer, I still, even with this I don't see the Federation making a change, for someone like him, all that matters is the World Cup,” Lalas claimed on his State of the Union podcast.

“But, pushing all of those chips into next summer, but not only doing that, but on the other side, when we are seeing these games, I mean, there have to be panic buttons being pushed behind the scenes and certainly out there in American soccer land.”

Delving deeper into the performance of Pochettino's side against Switzerland, which saw him make nine changes from their loss to Turkey in an attempt to give fresh faces a chance to shine, his side ultimately fell flat early on, going 4-0 down within 36 minutes.

“The lack of energy, the lack of commitment, and in particular, because it's easy just to say, ‘spirit, energy, commitment,' I think the lack of the ability to press as a team and to be capable of doing it,” Lalas said of a team which is missing multiple presumptive starters such as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, and Antonee Robinson this summer. “And this is where I get into Mauricio Pochettino, I don't think that he should be absolved by any stretch of the imagination with what is going on here.”

What's more, Lalas believed that the USMNT looked as if they did not “know what they want to do, either because, like I said, they don't know what they want to do, or a team that can't do it.

“And I do think that, to be fair, even though this is a criticism, these players from a pure soccer perspective, individually and collectively, this group was not up to it.”

Perhaps fortunately for the USMNT, there is no time to sit and dwell on this latest gut punch, with their Gold Cup opener against Trinidad and Tobago scheduled for Sunday in San Jose. This will be followed by a trip to Austin on June 19, where they will face Saudi Arabia, before staying in Texas to take on Haiti in Arlington three days later.

FIFA Club World Cup

Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen have been included in Real Madrid's squad for the Club World Cup.

The 15-time European champions reached an agreement with Liverpool last month for Alexander-Arnold to join early and play in FIFA's newly-expanded tournament for his new club.

Huijsen joined in a £50million ($67.7m) deal from Bournemouth and will line up in a new-look defence alongside Alexander-Arnold under head coach Xabi Alonso. The 43-year-old former midfielder was confirmed as Carlo Ancelotti's successor as Madrid head coach on May 25, signing a three-year deal with the club.

Luka Modric is also included ahead of his departure from the Bernabeu. The 39-year-old announced his exit in May and is attracting interest from Milan, as reported by The Athletic.

Lucas Vazquez will also leave after the tournament and is part of the group. The 33-year-old, who has deputised at right-back for long periods of his Madrid career, will leave following the expiration of his contract this month.

Fellow full-back Dani Carvajal, who has been sidelined since injuring his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in October, has also been selected alongside a host of youngsters including Sergio Mestre, Youssef Enriquez (Yusi), Jacobo Ramon, Jesus Fortea, Diego Aguado, Chema Andres, Mario Martin, Gonzalo Garcia and Victor Munoz.

Madrid's 2024-25 season was one of the club's most difficult domestic campaigns in recent years. They were runners-up in La Liga behind Barcelona, finishing four points behind their Clasico rivals. They also lost in the finals of the Spanish Super Cup and the Copa del Rey to Barcelona, and have lost their last four consecutive games against the Catalans. Madrid were knocked out of the Champions League by Arsenal in the quarter-finals after being beaten home and away.

Goalkeepers: Thibaut Courtois, Andriy Lunin, Fran Gonzalez, Sergio Mestre

Defenders: Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, David Alaba, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Lucas Vazquez, Fran Garcaa, Antonio Rudiger, Ferland Mendy, Dean Huijsen, Youssef Enriquez, Jacobo Ramon, Raul Asencio, Jesus Fortea, Diego Aguado

Midfielders: Jude Bellingham, Eduardo Camavinga, Fede Valverde, Luka Modric, Aurelien Tchouameni, Arda Guler, Dani Ceballos, Chema Andres, Victor Munoz, Mario Martin

Forwards: Vinicius Junior, Kylian Mbappe, Rodrygo, Endrick, Brahim Diaz, Gonzalo Garcia

Alonso has called up all the first-team players except Ferland Mendy, as the French left-back's recovery from a muscle injury is going to take longer than the rest of Madrid's sidelined players.

That is why Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, Eduardo Camavinga and Endrick are travelling to complete the final phase of their recovery with the rest of the squad.

In terms of signings, Madrid had hoped to have three available by now but so far they only have two: Huijsen and Alexander-Arnold. The third was left-back Alvaro Carreras, who Madrid are still working to sign for July but who has been included in Benfica's squad for the tournament.

Given the list of absentees, Alonso has decided to call up nine academy players to complete the squad: goalkeepers Fran Gonzalez and Sergio Mestre; defenders Youssef Enriquez (Yusi), Diego Aguado, Jacobo Ramon and Jesus Fortea, midfielders Chema Andres and Mario Martin and forwards Gonzalo Garcia and Victor Munoz.

Perhaps the most surprising of these is Martin, the 21-year-old who spent last season on loan at Real Valladolid and has been brought back before the end of his loan spell to complete the squad in midfield.

But probably the most interesting to watch is the right-back Fortea, who signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022, breaking a so-called ‘pact of non-aggression' between the city rivals. This is the first time he has been given a chance with the first team.

Strikers Garcia and Munoz, meanwhile, will be looking to impress. They have attracted interest from elsewhere and could be on the move after the tournament.

Club World Cup spaces were allocated based on performances in the Champions League over four seasons from 2020-21 up to and including this season. Madrid have lifted the Champions League twice during that time, in 2022 and 2024.

They have won the tournament a record 15 times, with Liverpool next on that list with seven triumphs.

In December 2024, FIFA agreed a deal with streaming service DAZN for the global rights to broadcast all 63 games, claiming it to be worth around $1billion. DAZN hold the option to sub-licence to local free-to-air channels.

In the United States, 24 games across the group and knockout stages will be shown on TNT Sports' cable networks TNT, TBS and truTV. Every game will be shown on TNT's streaming service.

As well as on DAZN, fans in the UK can catch 15 group games, four last-16 matches, two quarter-final games, one semi-final and the final on the free-to-air Channel 5.

NWSL

University of North Carolina midfielder Evelyn Shores isn't taking a break this summer.

Six months after helping the Tar Heels capture their 23rd NCAA title,  she scored the winning goal last month for the U.S. women's national team against Germany at under-23 level. And on Monday, she found the back of the net again, winning $1million for the US Women at The Soccer Tournament (TST) staged just miles from her university. 

Advertisement

Recruited by former USWNT midfielder Heather O'Reilly, 20 years her senior, Shores joined a team of American legends, including O'Reilly, Carli Lloyd and Ali Krieger, for the seven-a-side, winner-takes-all competition. 

“I was sprinting back to recover on defense, saw Heather (O'Reilly) win the ball, and just went. I was exhausted, but I had to go,” Shores tells The Athletic. “She put it on a platter for me. I had to finish it.”

 

 

A post shared by TST (@tst7v7)



Though still jetlagged from her trip across the Atlantic Ocean with the under-23s, Shores went straight into training alongside players she'd watched win World Cups and Olympic gold medals. 

“Playing one-v-one in practice with Carli Lloyd the day after flying in from Germany? That was insane,” she says. “They made us feel like equals. That was the craziest part.”

She was one of the five North Carolina (UNC) players O'Reilly invited to join her and the other World Cup winners at TST, which takes place over a week in Cary, North Carolina. 

“I have always liked Evelyn as a player, from the first minute I saw her play at Carolina,” O'Reilly tells The Athletic. “I'm thrilled that she had that goal, because she had a very good tournament and does a lot of nuanced work for the team that maybe isn't flashy, but she had her moment, and we are all so happy about that.”

For Shores, TST was a refreshing change of pace.

“It's such a fun tournament,” she says. “The ball moves fast, everyone's pressing, you sub out the second you're tired, and fans are basically on top of the field. It's a different kind of soccer — and maybe more exciting for people who aren't into the traditional 11 v 11 (format).”

The 20-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia, began her soccer journey at age four at Tophat FC, an elite youth academy in her home state. For Shores, soccer is a family tradition. Her mother, a former North Carolina player, was her first coach. Her grandpa had coached her mom. 

“I wrote a letter to myself in fifth grade saying I hoped I'd get a scholarship to UNC. I committed in eighth grade (a child's aged 13 or 14 year),” Shores said. “I always knew I wanted to come here.”

That commitment has paid off. In her rookie year, she appeared in 13 matches, finishing that season ranked third on the team with four goals, three assists and 11 points, to lead all UNC freshmen. She scored her first college brace in a three-minute stretch against the University of South Carolina, which included her first goal. 

But in the October, her promising first season came to a halt. While attempting a tackle near the sideline against Wake Forest, she got tangled up with an opposition player and collapsed, clutching her right knee, unable to stand without help. Five days later, Shores announced she'd torn her ACL and that her season was over. 

Amid the heartbreak, she had support from her family and friends throughout the recovery process and she counted the days to her comeback. After two surgeries and a difficult rehabilitation period, Shores returned in 2024 to play in the final 10 games of the season, with her first appearance back coming against No. 1-ranked Duke in the regular-season finale. 

“My first goal back from my injury was very special,” she tells The Athletic. 

She scored against Duke, UNC's biggest rival, with her left foot in the 44th minute. 

“After such a long time off the field, coming back and scoring was like a huge deal to me,” she says. 

Just over a month later, Shores played 44 minutes as UNC beat Wake Forest 1-0 to win the NCAA title.

Announcing herself with a goal is a habit now.

When Shores was named to the USWNT Under-23 camp last month, she was the only player there not signed to a professional contract. But that didn't matter on the field. In the final minute of stoppage time on May 30 in the German town of Aspach, after a scramble in the box, Seattle Reign center back Jordyn Bugg lifted a ball over Germany's defense. Shores got on the end of the looping pass and one-timed the ball into the net.

“It was a surreal experience,” Shores tells The Athletic. “Honestly, I couldn't even really celebrate after the goal, because I was just so relieved.”

The U.S. split results during the window, losing 2-1 to the Germans a couple of days later, and Shores flew directly back to North Carolina to represent the U.S. in a different capacity. She, again, introduced herself with a game-winning goal.

 

 

A post shared by Evelyn Shores (@evelynshores)



For now, Shores is focused on a healthy return, another trip to the NCAA College Cup, and if the stars align, TST again next year. 

As for the $1million she helped win, for not just herself but the players she's looked up to? Unfortunately for Shores, NCAA rules prohibit student-athletes from accepting prize money. “I'm not actually sure where my portion goes,” she says with a shrug. “But I'm just happy to be a part of it.”

A spokesperson for TST confirmed that the money that could not be awarded to the college players was divided evenly among the rest of the group.

While her TST goal may be the most high-profile moment yet, it's likely just the beginning for the rising college junior. She's still undecided about whether she'll pursue a professional career in the U.S. or abroad, but one thing's clear: she's got options.

 “I've always wanted to be a pro. That's been the dream since I was little,” she said.

“This will be my first healthy preseason in a while,” Shores said, speaking about her immediate future. “Just being back on the field, competing, playing with teammates I love, it's all been surreal.”

Chelsea have confirmed their squad list for the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup in the United States. The Blues kick off their tournament on Monday, June 16 as they take on Los Angeles FC at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. 

Notable omissions from the squad include Wesley Fofana. The 24-year-old defender had successful hamstring surgery back in April and he has not recovered in time to take any part in the action over in the United States.

Djordje Petrovic has also not been included despite the Serbian goalkeeper impressing while on loan at Strasbourg. Only one loanee from the 2024/25 season - in the form of Andrey Santos - has been named in Enzo Maresca's squad.

In the squad, though, is Liam Delap. The 22-year-old striker completed a £30million move from Ipswich Town last week and he could be in line to make his Chelsea debut on Monday evening in Atlanta.

Dario Essugo, another new signing, is also on the list for the Blues. Mamadou Sarr, who was confirmed as a Chelsea player earlier in the week, is also in the squad.

Mike Penders, who has arrived from Genk this summer, is among the four goalkeepers that also include Robert Sanchez, Filip Jorgensen and Gabriel Slonina. As mentioned, Santos will take part in his first competitive action for Chelsea since signing two years ago.

Tyrique George and Josh Acheampong have both been awarded with a place in the 28-man squad after fine respective breakthrough seasons. Marc Guiu is in the squad as well even though the Spaniard is expected to be loaned out next term.

Christopher Nkunku has made the list but the Frenchman is very much expected to depart Stamford Bridge this summer, football.london understands. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who also faces an uncertain future, will be on the plane to the United States.

Full Chelsea squad -

Goalkeepers: Robert Sanchez, Filip Jorgensen, Mike Penders, Gabriel Slonina

Defenders: Marc Cucurella, Tosin Adarabioyo, Benoit Badiashile, Levi Colwill, Mamadou Sarr, Trevoh Chalobah, Reece James, Malo Gusto, Aaron Anselmino, Josh Acheampong

Midfielders: Moises Caicedo, Andrey Santos, Romeo Lavia, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Dario Essugo, Enzo Fernandez

Attackers: Pedro Neto, Liam Delap, Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Nicolas Jackson, Christopher Nkunku, Tyrique George, Marc Guiu

The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.

Raheem Sterling and Jack Grealish spent one season together at Manchester City

Raheem Sterling, Joao Felix, Axel Disasi and Ben Chilwell have been left out of Chelsea's squad for the Fifa Club World Cup, while Jack Grealish has not been selected by Manchester City.

England forward Grealish was expected to miss out, with the 29-year-old having started just seven league games in 2024-25.

City's 27-man squad also does not include former captain Kyle Walker, who spent the second half of last season on loan at AC Milan, but features England defender John Stones, who has not played since February with a thigh injury.

Chelsea's 28-man group does not feature a quartet which cost them about £179m in transfer fees and all ended last season out on loan.

The first edition of the expanded Club World Cup format begins in the United States on Sunday, 15 June (01:00 BST).

Sterling cost £50m when he arrived from Manchester City in 2022, but the 30-year-old England forward spent last season on loan with Arsenal, starting just 13 games and scoring once. 

Felix made a permanent move to Chelsea last summer for £45m and scored seven goals from 20 appearances before the Portugal forward, 25, ended the campaign on loan at AC Milan.

The Blues paid £38.5m to sign Axel Disasi from Monaco in 2023 and the 27-year-old France defender played 17 games last term before ending the season on loan with Aston Villa.

Chilwell was a £45m signing in 2020 and, after just one Chelsea game last term, the England left-back, 28, spent the rest of the season with Crystal Palace, being an unused substitute in the Eagles' FA Cup final win over Manchester City.

Serbia goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic, 25, will not be travelling to the US either, after spending last season on loan with Strasbourg.

Goalkeepers: Robert Sanchez, Filip Jorgensen, Mike Penders, Gaga Slonina.

Defenders: Marc Cucurella, Tosin Adarabioyo, Benoit Badiashile, Levi Colwill, Mamadou Sarr, Moises Caicedo, Trevoh Chalobah, Reece James, Malo Gusto, Aaron Anselmino, Josh Acheampong.

Midfielders: Pedro Neto, Enzo Fernandez, Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Dario Essugo, Andrey Santos, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Romeo Lavia.

Forwards: Liam Delap, Nicolas Jackson, Christopher Nkunku, Tyrique George, Marc Guiu.

Why are Chelsea in the Club World Cup, but not Liverpool?

Man City sign £46.5m Reijnders - but where will he fit in?

Grealish's future is unclear as he has struggled for regular playing time with Manchester City over the past two seasons.

Pep Guardiola's side have also signed midfielders Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki this week, along with left-back Rayan Ait-Nouri and keeper Marcus Bettinelli, and all will travel to America.

Stones, 31, will return to action despite missing international duty with England over the weekend, and Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, 28, will continue his comeback from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in September.

Academy product James McAtee, 22, will remain at the European Under-21 Championship, where the attacking midfielder is England captain.

Goalkeepers: Ederson, Stefan Ortega, Marcus Bettinelli.

Defenders: Ruben Dias, John Stones, Nathan Ake, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Vitor Reis, Josko Gvardiol, Manuel Akanji, Abdukodir Khusanov, Rico Lewis.

Midfielders: Tijjani Reijnders, Jeremy Doku, Nico Gonzalez, Rodri, Ilkay Gundogan, Bernardo Silva, Savinho, Matheus Nunes, Rayan Cherki, Phil Foden, Nico O'Reilly.

Forwards: Omar Marmoush, Erling Haaland, Claudio Echeverri, Oscar Bobb.

We're now exactly one year away from the biggest sporting event in the world descending on North America. But before a single ball is kicked at the 2026 World Cup next summer, there remains more than 200 nations competing in hundreds of matches to try to qualify for the tournament. It's a bit easier to qualify now, thanks to the first expansion of the competition since 1998. That year's World Cup saw the number of teams increase from 24 to 32; now, 48 teams will compete for the trophy in 2026. Even with the extra space, we've seen plenty of historically successful soccer nations miss the World Cup before (I'm looking at you, Italy), and there are bound to be a few surprises along the way. 

Here are the continental breakdowns for qualifying, which is already well underway. Thirteen teams have clinched their qualification so far, including the three host nations of Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

Forty-six teams will qualify directly for the tournament, and the remaining six teams will head to a playoff for the final two spots. To create the most accurate power rankings, I've tried to best project the remainder of the qualifying process. (Fair warning: This is borderline impossible, but it's a fun thought exercise.) As a result, the rankings are reflective of both form and talent, and they're forward-looking to the best prospects of qualifying. The bottom six are the teams I think could end up in the playoff, hence why there are 52 teams included instead of 48. The most notable omission is Nigeria, who is currently on the outside looking in as far as qualifying in Africa. 

Without further ado, here are the 52 potential World Cup teams, ranked.

A Year Out From the World Cup, the USMNT Looks Unprepared to Defend Home Turf

FIFA's Club World Cup Is an Audacious Bet on Limitless Growth—and Greed

Star man: César Zeoula (Chauvigny)

Fact to know: New Caledonia is ranked 151st in the FIFA World Rankings, 65 spots lower than any other team on this list 

New Caledonia lost comfortably to New Zealand in the Oceanic playoff for the lone guaranteed World Cup spot. Now, the island nation of 290,000 people will head to two rounds of playoffs for one of the final few spots in the tournament. They'll be heavy underdogs to reach the final 48, but that's why we play the game. The majority of their roster plays domestically in the New Caledonian league, and a handful play in the French lower leagues. 

Star man: Darwin Cerén (Águila)

Fact to know: El Salvador has qualified for the World Cup twice (1970, 1982) but has lost all six of its group-stage matches

The fact that CONCACAF, a fairly weak confederation, could get eight teams in the 2026 World Cup is probably the biggest argument against expanding the World Cup field. That being said, CONCACAF will send two teams to the inter-confederation playoff in addition to its six auto qualifiers. El Salvador is in the glob of teams who could well end up in the playoff. El Salvador was placed into the most interesting Gold Cup group—with Canada, Honduras, and Curacao—this summer, which will give us a good look at how they stack up when the competition kicks off on June 14. 

Star man: Anthony Lozano (Santos Laguna)

Fact to know: Honduras has qualified for three World Cups in its history, most recently in 2014

Honduras couldn't hold on to their lead in the second leg of the Nations League quarterfinals against Mexico in November, but their 2-0 win in the first leg caught my eye. The Hondurans will have a shot to qualify directly into the field of 48, given that there's not much of a gap between teams they're competing with in the region. The Hondurans have never won a World Cup match before, and while they're ultimately unlikely to qualify, CONCACAF is the land of opportunity in this World Cup cycle.

Star man: Al Al-Hamadi (Ipswich Town)

Fact to know: Iraq has made one World Cup appearance, in 1986

The ninth and final team from Asia will have to go through the inter-confederation playoffs. Given the depth of opposition in South America and Africa, odds are this ninth Asian team will not actually make it into the final 48. Iraq was beaten twice by South Korea during qualifying, but they did pull off an upset against Japan during the Asian Cup last year, which led to them winning their group during group play. 

Star man: Yoane Wissa (Brentford)

Fact to know: Then known as Zaire, DR Congo was the first sub-Saharan team to ever qualify for the World Cup in 1974

They're currently in a tough battle with Senegal for first place in their qualifying group, but DR Congo will be one of the favorites to claim the last African spot if they do fall out of the top spot. They've been defensively stout in qualifying thus far, conceding just two goals in six matches. DR Congo is fresh off a solid showing in the last African Cup of Nations (AFCON), where they knocked out Egypt and Guinea before losing to eventual champion Ivory Coast in the semifinal. 

Star man: Salomón Rondón (Pachuca)

Fact to know: Venezuela is the only CONMEBOL side to never qualify for the World Cup

Whichever South American team ends up in the playoff will instantly become a clear favorite to make the field of 48. Venezuela is most likely to be that team, and they're coming off an impressive showing at the Copa Ámerica last summer. They won all three matches in their group against Ecuador, Mexico, and Jamaica—all teams likely to qualify for this World Cup. We reserved the bottom six teams in these rankings for the likely playoff spots, but Venezuela is actually talented enough to potentially reach the knockouts of the World Cup proper, depending on their group. 

Star man: Chris Wood (Nottingham Forest)

Fact to know: New Zealand finished ahead of Italy in their group at the 2010 World Cup in their last tournament appearance, but still failed to advance to the knockout round

New Zealand confirmed its place in the World Cup with a 3-0 win against New Caledonia. You could argue that no nation has benefited more from the expanded field than New Zealand, who is consistently the best team in OFC but will be one of the lowest FIFA-ranked teams in the tournament. Club-wise, New Zealand has players scattered across the globe, but none are more renowned than Nottingham Forest striker Chris Wood. He has 44 career goals for the Kiwis and scored an impressive 20 goals in the Premier League this past season.

Star man: Francisco Calvo (Hatayspor)

Fact to know: Costa Rica is the last CONCACAF team to advance past the round of 16 in a World Cup, as they were quarterfinalists in 2014 

This is not your older brother's Costa Rica squad. They always seem to be in the mix in these international tournaments—they beat Japan in the group of death at Qatar 2022 and tied Brazil at the Copa Ámerica last summer. Unfortunately, Costa Rica's overall talent level is headed in the wrong direction following a golden generation that brought so much success at the international level.

They have had a strong start in CONCACAF qualifying thus far, but trying to figure out which teams will qualify behind the clear top four in the confederation (Panama and the three hosts) is a difficult task right now. Goalkeeper Keylor Navas, 38, once of Real Madrid and PSG fame, captained the side in a qualifying win against the Bahamas last week.

Star man: Leon Bailey (Aston Villa)

Fact to know: Former Newcastle manager and Manchester United assistant Steve McClaren is the manager of Jamaica

The Reggae Boyz have made the World Cup once in their history and just missed out on the knockout round in 1998. Leon Bailey had a public feud with the top brass in the Jamaican soccer apparatus, but it appears they've moved on and settled their dispute. Jamaica was placed in arguably the most balanced group at Copa Ámerica (Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela) and still lost all three games. They've again been placed in a fairly even group at this summer's Gold Cup and we'll get to see if they can advance in a group with Guadeloupe, Panama, and Guatemala. 

Leon Bailey and Demarai Gray are two wide forwards that give Jamaica a real threat playing on the break and in transition. 

Star man: Khalid Eisa (Al Ain)

Fact to know: The United Arab Emirates have qualified for the World Cup once (1990), but lost all three matches

It's difficult to sort out who will claim the remaining spots in Asian qualifying, with six teams headed to the final round for the final three Asian places in the field of 52 (with the addition of playoffs). I picked UAE along with the next team on this list simply because they have the best goal difference of the likely playoff teams during the current qualifying round. UAE's run at the Asian Cup last year ended earlier than expected with a round of 16 penalty shootout loss to Tajikistan. 

The margins between the Asian teams in this tier are tiny, but UAE do have a higher Transfermarkt squad value than Iran, who is one of the top teams on the continent. 

Star man: Firas Al-Buraikan (Al Ahli)

Fact to know: Hervé Renard is back as Saudi Arabia manager after leading them at the last World Cup

Saudi Arabia's win against Argentina in their opening game of the 2022 World Cup is legitimately one of the biggest upsets in world soccer history. Hervé Renard's leaked halftime speech to the dressing room has become famous worldwide. Renard is a well-respected international manager who has successfully coached throughout Africa as well as the French women's national team. 

Odds are Saudi Arabia won't top the win against Argentina in this World Cup, and they are still far from assured a qualifying place. Their guest Gold Cup appearance this summer will present real opportunities for Renard to mold the team in his image before the key qualifying playoff matches this fall. Saudi Arabia plays the United States on June 19 in the second group game. 

Star man: Mousa Tamari (Rennes)

Fact to know: Jordan is making its World Cup debut in 2026

Jordan is in the midst of their best-ever run as a soccer-playing nation right now. Not only will they be World Cup debutants, but they also made a run to the Asian Cup final in 2023. They ultimately lost to host nation Qatar, but not without beating Iraq and South Korea en route to the final. It was one of the most fascinating runs in recent tournament history, as Jordan scored twice in stoppage time to beat Iraq in the round of 16, won on an own goal in the quarterfinal against Tajikistan, but then lost the final by conceding three penalties to Qatar. Jordan will hope to be just as entertaining in North America next summer. 

Star man: Abdukodir Khusanov (Manchester City)

Fact to know: Uzbekistan is making its World Cup debut in 2026

Roma's Eldor Shomurodov, who captains the Uzbekistan national team, tallied four goals and four assists for Roma in Serie A this season, and Abdukodir Khusanov earned a big-money move to Manchester City in January. Those are the two key players propping up Uzbekistan and leading their squad into the World Cup. They played Iran to a draw in both qualifying matches, which should provide some optimism for their chances to be competitive in their debutant appearance next summer.

 

Star man: Bongokuhle Hlongwane (Minnesota United)

Fact to know: South Africa was the first African nation to host the World Cup. Morocco will cohost with Spain and Portugal in 2030.

South Africa hasn't been to the World Cup since it hosted the event in 2010. They've been to the tournament three times in total (all since 1998) and have never advanced past the group stage. In many ways, they are a surprise contender. When they were paired up with African heavyweight Nigeria in their qualifying group, they started as sizable underdogs to make this list. However, South Africa has a five-point lead over Rwanda and six points over Nigeria with four matches to play. 

Mark your calendars: The most important game is in September, when South Africa hosts Nigeria. If the South Africans can manage at least a draw, the math gets nearly impossible for Nigeria to catch them. 

Star man: Adalberto Carrasquilla (UNAM)

Fact to know: Panama first qualified for the World Cup in 2018 but lost all three games with a minus-9 goal differential

Fortunately for the United States, and maybe unfortunately for Panama, the Americans cannot be placed in a group with Panama at the World Cup since they hail from the same confederation. The Panamanians played a decisive role in knocking out the U.S. in the Copa Ámerica last year, then followed that up by knocking out the U.S. directly in the semifinal of the Nations League in March. Panama is the clear fourth-strongest team in North America right now, behind the three hosts of 2026 and ahead of challengers Costa Rica and Jamaica. Panama beat Costa Rica 3-2 on aggregate when the two nations matched up in the Nations League quarterfinals.

All that said, Panama's 5-0 defeat to Colombia in the Copa Àmerica quarterfinal and their 3-1 loss to Uruguay in the group stage shows that there is a sizable gap between Panama and the next tier of competitors in the World Cup.

Star man: Mathew Ryan (Lens)

Fact to know: Australia advanced from their group in the 2022 World Cup over Denmark and Tunisia before losing to eventual champions Argentina

Australia won the Asian Cup in 2015 under then-manager Ange Postecoglou. They've since lost in the quarterfinals in the last two editions in 2019 and 2023. Australia is a difficult team to rank because their Transfermarkt squad values would place them 71st in the world, while FIFA has them 26th in its official rankings. The reality is somewhere in the middle, as they've frequently been a competitive World Cup team in past cycles.

Star man: Mohammed Kudus (West Ham)

Fact to know: Ghana knocked out the United States from the 2006 and 2010 World Cups, but the U.S. got revenge in 2014 on a famous John Brooks header

Ghana's golden generation from 2006-14 aged out, but after failing to qualify in 2018, Ghana returned to the World Cup in 2022. Now, they have a talented squad with a handful of European regulars ready to challenge again for a place in the knockout stage. The breakout season from Antoine Semenyo at Bournemouth gives Ghana another attacking threat on the opposite flank from star man Mohammed Kudus. 

Qualifying rival Mali has underachieved thus far in their group, which leaves Ghana in first place, three points ahead of surprise package Comoros with four matches to play. 

Star man: Alphonso Davies (Bayern Munich)

Fact to know: Canadian manager Jesse Marsch is an American, and he often likes to remind the U.S. Soccer Federation of that 

You could make a case that Canada is actually the second-most talented North American squad from top to bottom, ahead of Mexico. With attacking fullback Davies and striker Jonathan David, the Canadians have maybe the two best players in the entire confederation. They have a clear playing style and have fully adopted Marsch's high-intensity tactics, but I'm also not overreacting to Canada's run to the semifinal of the Copa América last year. It was a successful tournament, but the Canadians really struggled to score goals when it mattered. They lost 2-0 to Mexico in the Nations League semifinal in March, too. 

Star man: Hannibal Mejbri (Burnley)

Fact to know: Tunisia finished dead last in its AFCON group in 2023 and failed to reach the knockout stage 

Tunisia has played six matches in World Cup qualifying and still hasn't conceded a goal. It hasn't been a difficult group, with the likes of Namibia and Liberia as opposition, but the Tunisians are on the path to a seamless qualification. Tunisia pulled off a shocking upset against France and tied Denmark at the last World Cup, but it still wasn't enough to advance because of a loss to Australia. There's not a ton of goal-scoring firepower in this squad, but it is an organized defensive outfit that has proved difficult to break down on the global stage. 

Tunisia will play in the same group as Nigeria in the Africa Cup of Nations this winter. The last AFCON didn't go as planned, but this match will be a compelling test for them prior to next summer. Their most recent measuring-stick match was a 2-0 friendly defeat to Morocco.

Star man: Riyad Mahrez (Al-Ahli)

Fact to know: According to oddsmakers, Algeria is tied for second (along with Egypt) to win AFCON in January 

After a solid 2023 AFCON showing, Guinea has really underperformed in World Cup qualifying. That has opened the door for Algeria to return to the World Cup for the first time since it took eventual champion Germany to extra time in the 2014 knockout stage. Algeria is in first place with a three-point lead over Mozambique, and the two sides have no more head-to-head matchups left on the qualifying calendar. 

With Rayan Ait-Nouri—who's recently earned a big move to Manchester City—Ramy Bensebaini, and Mahrez, the Algerians will be very dangerous moving the ball up the field in wide areas and creating chances via crossing. They have a handful of Big Five European league regulars and shouldn't be overlooked. 

Star man: Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)

Fact to know: Seven players on the current Egyptian squad play domestically for Al Ahly, who are in the Club World Cup this summer  

Egypt has made the World Cup only once in Mo Salah's career, and it lost all three of its games in 2018. The question has always been about the talent surrounding Salah and whether it's good enough to supplement him. With the breakout season from Manchester City's Omar Marmoush, Egypt now has a secondary scoring option to add to Salah's production. The team needs both of its stars to be healthy to have any chance of reaching its potential because the depth otherwise is uninspiring.

As long as Egypt avoids defeat at Burkina Faso in its September match, it should have no issues qualifying. A loss could make their World Cup status a bit more dicey. 

Star man: Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)

Fact to know: Since a shock quarterfinal run in 1990, Cameroon has been eliminated in the group stage of the last six World Cups it qualified for

Cameroon still faces a bit of a challenge to qualify for the tournament, as it is one point behind Cape Verde in the standings with four matches to play and has to travel to play at Cape Verde in another head-to-head match. Cameroon won the reverse fixture 4-1 at home, so I am making a bit of an assumption that it'll surpass the Cape Verdeans in the final matches. 

With Mbeumo, Carlos Baleba, and André Onana, Cameroon has regular starters across the pitch in the Premier League. There are no top Champions League regulars in the squad, but they have enough depth to make noise next summer.

 

Star man: Simon Adingra (Brighton & Hove Albion)

Fact to know: Ivory Coast has the best goal difference of an African team in qualifying so far

Bona fide legends Yaya Touré and Didier Drogba are no longer lacing their boots for the Ivory Coast, but there's still a lot of talent on this roster. The team's run through the AFCON last year was one of the most interesting stories in sports in 2024. They fired their manager mid-tournament for poor performances and went on to win the whole damn thing with the interim coach. 

The problem for past Ivorian teams was a reliance on just a couple of stars. This team doesn't have any major stars, but there are a lot of players at clubs in top-five leagues across Europe. That golden generation of Touré and Drogba never made a World Cup knockout stage, but this group will have a real chance to do that for the first time. 

Star man: Robert Lewandowski (Barcelona)

Fact to know: Lewandowski has said he won't play for Poland as long as Michal Probierz is the manager 

Poland has been consistently good at qualifying for major tournaments and consistently bad at achieving much in said tournaments. It finished last in a difficult group at Euro 2024 and last in its group in Euro 2020. The 2022 World Cup was the lone breakthrough for the Poles in recent memory as they advanced to the round of 16 over Mexico and Saudi Arabia before falling to France. 

They'll be battling it out with the Netherlands for the automatic qualifying spot, but they'll also be one of the favorites to advance through the playoff if necessary. If Lewandowski actually sits out, the team's chances of qualifying could be dicey. Or they could just fire the manager. It's safe to say Lewandowski is more critical than Probierz to Poland's chances of qualifying at this point. A 2-1 loss to Finland on Tuesday won't help their chances. 

Star man: Julio Enciso (Ipswich Town)

Fact to know: Paraguay last qualified for the World Cup in 2010 and made the quarterfinal

Paraguay's collection of talent doesn't stand out in South America, and it didn't perform well in its Copa América group last summer, finishing last, behind Costa Rica, Colombia, and Brazil. However, CONMEBOL qualifying is the most grueling of them all, and Paraguay still sits in an automatic qualifying place. Goal scoring has been an issue for them in past cycles, but the emergence of Enciso has given them a primary creator to focus their team around. 

Star man: Mehdi Taremi (Inter Milan)

Fact to know: Iran has consistently been the first- or second-best Asian team in FIFA rankings, but it lost in the semifinals of the last two Asian Cups in 2019 and 2023

Iran came up just short of advancing to the knockout stage in each of the last two World Cups, but it has gone toe-to-toe with the United States, Spain, and Portugal in past matchups. Iran was one of the top contenders to win the 2023 Asian Cup until it lost in an upset (3-2) to host nation Qatar in the semifinals. Now in their fourth consecutive World Cup, the Iranians are still looking for their first trip to the knockout round. 

Iran feels like it's on the precipice of breaking through globally. The expanded format could finally get them a knockout game, but it's hard to see much more than that. 

Star man: Edson Álvarez (West Ham)

Fact to know: El Tri has four players in Europe's top five leagues right now—Álvarez, Raúl Jiménez (Fulham), Santiago Giménez (AC Milan), and Johan Vásquez (Genoa) 

Mexico won the CONCACAF Nations League in March, beating Canada and Panama en route to the trophy. It was a much-needed boost to a team that had been in steady decline. Not only did the Mexicans get grouped at the World Cup for the first time in the 21st century in 2022, but they followed it up with a loss to Venezuela that led them to get grouped in the Copa América last summer. The Gold Cup will be an opportunity for a third straight confederation trophy, but the team is still less talented than the United States at the moment.  

The home-field advantage is sure to play a part for the Mexicans in the North American summer heat. They'll be looking to bottle up striker Giménez's club form for AC Milan and translate it to the national team. 

Star man: Heung-min Son (Tottenham Hotspur)

Fact to know: Son needs eight goals to break Cha Bum-kun's all-time South Korean goal-scoring record of 58

South Korea finished the Asian World Cup qualifiers unbeaten in 10 matches and will carry a wealth of talent from Europe's top five leagues to North America next summer. Son and Bayern's Kim-min Jae have been well-known European regulars for years now, and they will be looking to build on the late heroics that saw them reach the round of 16 at the last World Cup. 

Star man: Christian Pulisic (AC Milan)

Fact to know: The United States conceded four goals in the first half of Tuesday's friendly against Switzerland for the first time since 1980

The team's form under Mauricio Pochettino certainly hasn't been encouraging. The United States has shown clear regression since their quality round of 16 showing at the 2022 World Cup, and it's not obvious that the Americans have any real solutions for their lack of center back depth or goalkeeper issues. But it's important to note that the U.S. teams that recently lost to Panama, Canada, Türkiye, and Switzerland didn't have the United States' best possible 11 on the roster. The team relies so heavily on fullbacks Antonee Robinson and Sergino Dest to create chances and move the ball forward that the absence of both has created real problems in recent matches. 

I have so many questions about the state of the USMNT. They'll be playing games at home, but is that even a huge advantage right now, given the general malaise of the national team? Is it possible for the Americans to gain some momentum between now and next June? Why can't the United States get Chris Richards, Malik Tillman, and Johnny Cardoso to replicate their quality club performances for the national team? Will goalkeeper Matt Turner be able to land a starting spot at the club level so that he can remain sharp heading into the World Cup? There are lots of questions to ponder.

 

Star man: Erling Haaland (Manchester City)

Fact to know: I've officially declared them “everyone's favorite dark horse that isn't actually a dark horse”

Norway hasn't been to the World Cup since the 1998 edition. They are well on their way to qualification following a 3-0 demolition of Italy at home last week. If they take care of business against group minnows Moldova and Estonia, they'll qualify directly as group winners. 

Norway hasn't even been to the Euros since 2000, but they have a really talented core right now. Haaland is one of the best goal scorers on the planet, and his link-up play with primary creator Martin Ødegaard is as good as that of any one-two attacking combination in the world. It's not just those two powering the current squad, though. Norway starts four Premier League regulars, plus Borussia Dortmund right back Julian Ryerson and Atlético Madrid super sub Alexander Sørloth. They'll be a popular dark horse next summer because of their pool of goal scorers and playmakers.

Star man: Boulaye Dia (Lazio)

Fact to know: Senegal is one of three African countries on this list, along with Morocco and Tunisia, that is expected to qualify for three consecutive World Cups

Goal scoring has been an issue for Senegal throughout World Cup qualifying, as they have tallied just eight goals in six matches. The defense remains an excellent unit—it's allowed just one goal—but the team has registered a string of draws, putting it a point behind DR Congo in its qualifying group. 

This combination of attackers—Sadio Mané, Ismaila Sarr, Boulaye Dia, and Iliman Ndaiye—has goals in them, but there's a lack of creators to give them chances, which hurt Senegal in 2022 and could now put their chances of qualification in moderate danger.  

Star man: Alessandro Bastoni (Inter Milan)

Fact to know: Italy lost to North Macedonia in a 2022 World Cup playoff match and missed the tournament as a result

Italy is one of the toughest teams to rank in the whole field because their World Cup chances are in peril following a 3-0 defeat to Norway in their first qualifying match. The Italians have two games in hand, but they are still nine points behind Norway and 12 goals behind them in goal difference. It will be very difficult for the Italians to qualify directly at this point, so they'll likely need to go through the playoffs (16 teams for four spots) to make the World Cup. 

You'd still want to trust the defensive and midfield talent of Italy if they manage to get into the competition, but they've been reliably mediocre since winning the Euros in 2021. Key attacking players Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne aren't around anymore, and Federico Chiesa is currently not in the squad after a disappointing (and injury-filled) season with Liverpool. Even Italy's Euro 2024 performance isn't particularly inspiring. They equalized with Croatia in the final minute of a group stage match but were comfortably outplayed by Spain and knocked out by Switzerland in the round of 16. It seems like Italy should be happy to even just make the World Cup, and if they get in, it's hard to see them making a real run. 

Star man: Alexander Isak (Newcastle)

Fact to know: Sweden's Euro 2024 qualifying play was such a disaster that they finished nine points behind Austria and 10 behind Belgium, failing to make the playoff round

Sweden's Euros qualifying campaign was a calamity, but if you're simply looking at their squad on paper, they jump off the page as a really talented team. The strike partnership of Viktor Gyokeres and Isak, along with the pair of Tottenham midfielders Lucas Bergvall and Dejan Kulusevski, looks like the core of a really competitive team. The questions are at the other end of the pitch, where there's considerably less top European talent. In a competitive group with the reliable Swiss and organized Slovenia, Sweden's path to the final 48 isn't obvious. But if they do end up in a playoff, in theory they'll be one of the most capable teams. 

After failing to qualify for the 2022 World Cup and 2024 Euros, Sweden now has a lot of in-form club players. Isak in particular stands out, having finished second behind Mohamed Salah in the Premier League Golden Boot race with 23 goals.

Star man: Arda Guler (Real Madrid)

Fact to know: Everyone will pick them as their dark horse next June, as is tradition 

The next three teams on this list all face real challenges in qualifying for the World Cup because of how difficult the path is in UEFA. Türkiye were paired with Spain in qualifying and will almost certainly finish second in the group as a result. That means they'll probably go to the playoff, but they do have as much talent as anyone in that pool of competition. We saw the highs and lows of Türkiye in the Euros, where they lost sloppily to Portugal but beat Austria in a thriller. Consecutive dominant Nations League wins against Hungary in March portend well for a potential World Cup playoff. 

As always with Türkiye, the question is about defense. But with midfielders Guler and Hakan Calhanoglu and a bunch of intriguing attacking dribblers, they'll be a difficult team to beat, should they make the field. A true wild card, as always. 

Star man: Marcel Sabitzer (Borussia Dortmund)

Fact to know: Austria hasn't been to the World Cup since 1998

My Euro 2024 dark horse squad is back for another major tournament under manager Ralf Rangnick and his high-intensity pressing tactics. The Austrians ultimately went out in a thriller against Türkiye in the round of 16, but not without beating the Netherlands and Poland first. Their form has been a little less consistent in the Nations League since, but Rangnick generally has them performing above their talent level. 

They'll point to a 5-1 win against Norway in the Nations League to show that they remain a real threat in this second tier of European contenders. Bosnia and Herzegovina is off to a great start in the qualifying group, though, and is currently sitting in first, so there's work for Austria to do. 

Star man: Joško Gvardiol (Manchester City)

Fact to know: It should come as no surprise that Luka Modric is Croatia's all-time leader in appearances, with 188

I thought that Croatia's aging core would be too old to run it back at the 2022 World Cup, and then they made it to the semifinals. Maybe the age of this squad finally caught up to them in the 2024 Euros, where they crashed out in the group stage, but they've given a good account of themselves in their Nations League matchups since then. They didn't advance against France in the quarterfinals, but taking one of the best teams in the world to penalties isn't a bad result. During the group stage, Croatia beat Poland, drew with Portugal, and were generally competitive in each of their matches. 

Croatia thrashed current World Cup qualifying group leaders Czechia on Monday, 5-1, and are now the clear favorite to finish in first place, given that they have two games over the Czechs in hand. The health and fitness of Modric and Mateo Kovacic will be the key to the outcomes of Croatia's aging midfield in one last dance.

    

Star man: Mikkel Damsgaard (Brentford)

Fact to know: Christian Eriksen has appeared 143 times for Denmark, the most of any Dane in history

Denmark hasn't yet begun their World Cup qualifying campaign, but they'll have to like their chances since they're in a group with Scotland, Belarus, and Greece. The Danes probably lack the high-profile talent to make a run to the World Cup quarterfinals and beyond, but they are a consistently reliable B-tier European team with an entire lineup of regulars from the big five leagues. 

The Danes weren't particularly impressive at the 2024 Euros, with three draws in three games against Slovenia, England, and Serbia, but they showed that they remain a quality defensive outfit. You should expect them not only to qualify for the World Cup, but also to get out of their group. Keep an eye out for the continued development and emergence of Brentford's Damsgaard. His creative production took a major leap in the Premier League last season, as he notched 10 assists—tied for fourth most in the league. 

Star man: Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad)

Fact to know: Japan became the first non-hosting team to qualify for the 2026 World Cup when they beat Bahrain in March 

Morocco's run to the semifinals at the 2022 World Cup took up all of the Cinderella oxygen, but Japan was nearly as fascinating in that tournament. They beat Spain and Germany thanks to elite out of possession defending and excellent direct counterattacking. They also lost to Costa Rica, one of the weakest teams in the tournament. Japan still profiles as something of a scrappy, transitional team, but they'll be a pesky underdog against whichever top favorite they meet. 

The Japanese had a very smooth path through the qualifiers in Asia, with just three goals conceded in 10 matches. They just smacked Indonesia 6-0 on Tuesday. With the likes of Kubo, Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma, and Liverpool's Wataru Endō, Japan have more talent on paper than the majority of the Asian teams headed to the World Cup. 

Star man: Moisés Caicedo (Chelsea)

Fact to know: This is only the fifth time Ecuador has ever reached the World Cup. They've had just one knockout appearance, in 2006.

What is the second-best team in South America? If you went by talent, you'd probably say Brazil. If you went by recent Copa Ámerica results, you could make a case for Colombia. But what if I told you that the second-best team—at least in World Cup qualifying—was actually Ecuador? They have allowed five total goals in 16 matches and have totaled the second-most points, behind Argentina. Ecuador also came the closest to beating Argentina at the Copa Ámerica last year, when they lost to Emiliano Martinez in a penalty shoot-out. 

The Ecuadoreans aren't flashy or particularly impressive on paper. But they have lost only twice in qualifying. Bayer Leverkusen's Piero Hincapié, PSG's Willian Pacho, Chelsea's Caicedo, and Brighton's Pervis Estupiñán make up a really solid defensive core. 

Star man: Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City, for now, but probably Napoli soon)

Fact to know: Romelu Lukaku has had 89 goals for Belgium in his career, which is more than double any other Belgian in history. Kevin De Bruyne is third with 31. 

We're well past the golden generation of Belgian stars who emerged in the mid-2010s, but that doesn't mean Belgium is no longer a player on the world stage. De Bruyne's time as a Premier League star is likely coming to an end, but he's still one of the most creative and technically gifted passers in the world. His game is well suited to international tournaments. The same is true for box-to-box midfielder Youri Tielemans. There will certainly be questions about how the Belgians will defend next summer—the top-level talent is lacking there—but a team with elite dribbler Jeremy Doku, De Bruyne, Tielemans, and the enigmatic Lukaku (who bagged 24 goal contributions in Serie A for title winner Napoli) will have no issues producing chances. 

Belgium was put in a pretty friendly qualifying group with North Macedonia, Wales, Kazakhstan, and Liechtenstein and should have no issues directly qualifying. They're not a contender to win the whole thing, but a deep underdog run can't be counted out. 

Star man: Achraf Hakimi (PSG)

Fact to know: Morocco made history by becoming the first African team to reach the semifinals of a World Cup in 2022

The Cinderella darlings of the 2022 World Cup are back with a similarly talented core group of players, as well as the same manager, Walid Regragui. Morocco rode its disciplined defensive structure and quality counterattacking to victories against Belgium, Spain, and Portugal in Qatar. They ultimately lost to France in the semifinal. Then, naturally, they followed that up with a shocking 2-0 loss to South Africa in the round of 16 of AFCON 2023. Still, Morocco's World Cup run is further proof that you don't need to dominate possessions to be successful in the international game, and having the ball is often overrated when analyzing team quality. 

With five wins in the first five qualifying matches, Morocco is on a path to comfortable qualification for the World Cup. Morocco is hosting AFCON 2025 in December, which will give African teams major preparation for the tournament. 

Star man: Granit Xhaka (Bayer Leverkusen)

Fact to know: I'm still expecting Xherdan Shaqiri to show up and score his usual banger out of nowhere, but he has indeed retired from the national team

Switzerland has been the pinnacle of consistency in past World Cups. It's lost in the round of 16 in four of the past five tournaments. The main core of players that defined the recent generation has aged a bit, but younger reinforcements helped push the team to the quarterfinals at the 2024 Euros. Switzerland dominated Italy and outplayed England last summer and came within a penalty shoot-out of the semifinal. Emerging winger Dan Ndoye and dynamite forward Breel Embolo provide the Swiss with a decent amount of attacking talent. 

They're not flashy or particularly impressive on paper, but Switzerland has always been a cohesive squad anchored by the still reliable Xhaka and Remo Freuler in midfield. Manchester City centerback Manuel Akanji gives them real pedigree on defense. Switzerland was placed in a competitive qualifying group with Sweden and Slovenia but will back themselves to finish in the top spot. 

Star man: Federico Valverde (Real Madrid)

Fact to know: Uruguay has roughly the same population as Connecticut and is the smallest—and first!—nation to ever win the World Cup

After losing in the 2021 Copa Ámerica quarterfinals and following it up with a World Cup group stage exit in 2022, Uruguay brought on Marcelo Bielsa to help the proud footballing nation rediscover its identity. They lost a tightly contested Copa semifinal to Colombia last summer, but beating the United States and Brazil in that tournament was a step in the right direction. 

Uruguay's path through CONMEBOL qualifying has been more of a mixed bag. They began well but now have had just two wins in their 11 games since the Copa Ámerica. The reason to bet on Uruguay is the team's overall talent. They have a ton of midfield quality and depth from Real Madrid's Valverde, Tottenham's Rodrigo Bentancur, and Manchester United's Manuel Ugarte, among others. It's a hardworking group that presses with relentless energy and defends well. The form of enigmatic attacker Darwin Núñez could be the key to Uruguay's goal-scoring explosiveness—because right now, it looks like they'll be playing a lot of low-scoring grinders in the World Cup.

 

Star man: Luis Diáz (Liverpool)

Fact to know: James Rodríguez is second of all time in goals for Colombia, with 29, behind only Radamel Falcao 

After missing out on Qatar 2022, Colombia has been one of the best teams in international football for three years. They went unbeaten in 28 consecutive matches before losing the Copa Ámerica final to Argentina in extra time last summer. Since that final, they've had a significant downturn in form. Colombia has had just one win in eight matches in CONMEBOL qualifying since October, and they've dropped to sixth in the table—the final spot for automatic qualification. They're safe for now, but a loss at Venezuela in the final round of qualifying matches in September could see them fall to the inter-confederation playoff. 

It's been 11 years since Rodríguez broke onto the world scene with his sensational performance at the 2014 World Cup. Rodríguez can't run like he used to and plays club soccer in the relatively weak Mexican league, but he's still a superb dead-ball specialist, and he was the best player in the Copa Àmerica last summer. 

Star man: Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool)

Fact to know: The Dutch have lost all three World Cup finals they've played in; they're the only nation to have reached three finals with no wins

The Netherlands made it to the 2024 Euro semifinals even though their first-choice midfielders, Frenkie de Jong and Teun Koopmeiners, weren't available. Without those two, the Dutch struggled to control games. With those central midfielders now fit and attacking midfielders Tijjani Reijnders and Xavi Simons joining them in the lineup, the Dutch are a well-balanced team with a ton of defensive experience and enough attacking output to challenge the elite tier of contenders in the World Cup. 

Cody Gakpo has been good but not great in his time at Liverpool, but he's been a major international tournament star for the Dutch. He scored three goals at the 2022 World Cup and three in last year's Euros—plus, he created the late winner that was ruled an own goal in the quarterfinal against Türkiye.

The Dutch kicked off their qualifying campaign with a comfortable 2-0 win against Finland and are favorites to win their group and qualify directly. 

Star man: Vinicius Júnior (Real Madrid)

Fact to know: Brazil has made at least the quarterfinals in every World Cup since 1994

Don Carlo Ancelotti will be Brazil's fourth manager (including caretakers) of this World Cup cycle since Tite's departure after Qatar. It's easy to forget just how quickly everything turned for Brazil during and after the 2022 World Cup. When Neymar scored an incredible team goal in extra time against Croatia, that was supposed to set up a historic clash with Argentina in the semifinal. Brazil was the oddsmakers' favorite to win the World Cup at the time. But then they conceded a late equalizer to Croatia, lost in the penalty shoot-out, and haven't been the same since. 

Neymar's torn ACL and the team's managerial uncertainty contributed to a poor showing at the Copa Ámerica. Brazil drew with Costa Rica and Colombia in the group stage before losing to Uruguay in the quarterfinal. Brazil could probably field two different teams of players who'd be competitive in this World Cup, but it's not clear what the best 11 is. They've won just two of their last six in qualifying, and Vinicius Júnior and Raphina are the only locked-down starters among their main attackers. 

Star man: Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen)

Fact to know: Former German striker Miroslav Klose holds the record for most goals scored in World Cup tournaments (16)

Germany ultimately lost at home to Spain in the Euro 2024 quarterfinals, but that was the highest-quality match of the tournament. Germany has failed to escape the group stage of the past two World Cups and also lost in the round of 16 at Euro 2021. By the time the World Cup kicks off, we won't have seen the Germans in the semifinals of a major tournament in a decade (since their Euro 2016 loss to France). 

Germany is spearheaded by two attacking midfield superstars, Jamal Musiala and Wirtz. Manager Julian Nagelsmann plays a system that enables both to get on the ball a ton, and the technical quality of the German midfield and attack is sublime. Yet questions about the strikers and the defense that have plagued Germany for a decade will likely still exist entering 2026. The combination of Kai Havertz and Niclas Fullkrug up top was decent but not great last summer. But the emergence and development of Stuttgart forward Nick Woltemade is a major thing to watch between now and next year. 

Nagelsmann is an excellent tactician, and Germany has a sky-high ceiling. But the defense just conceded eight goals in four games against Italy (twice), Portugal, and France. They'll need to shore things up if they want any chance of going deep next year.

Star man: Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United)

Fact to know: Cristiano Ronaldo is Portugal's all-time leading goal scorer, with 138 goals. Second place has 47. 

Even though they won the Nations League on Sunday in an Iberian clash with Spain, Portugal's future is uncertain. Will Cristiano Ronaldo be leading the line next summer, when he's 41? Ronaldo was detrimental to Portugal's performance in the 2024 Euros, but he's been productive in recent qualifying matches and scored the crucial equalizer on Sunday. It's a difficult decision because the squad has a lot of talented attacking players, but on the other hand … it's Ronaldo. 

The other question is about the team's manager. Rumors have been flying that Roberto Martínez may not lead Portugal next summer, even though he delivered the trophy on Sunday. Could José Mourinho join his native country's team? Given the squad's talent, you'd maybe want a more possession-based manager, but you can't deny Mourinho's tournament bona fides. Of the top 10 teams in these rankings, Portugal is the most difficult to judge. A new manager and tactical approach could unlock so much in this team, considering the passing range of Vitinha, Bernardo Silva, and Fernandes. They also have the rangy defending of Joao Neves, the left back marauding of Nuno Mendes, and a reliable goalkeeper in Diogo Costa. 

Based on its talent level, Portugal underperformed in the 2022 World Cup and 2024 Euros. They'll be back with one of the most stacked rosters again next summer, but there's a lot to iron out before then.  

Star man: Harry Kane (Bayern Munich)

Fact to know: England didn't qualify for the World Cup in 1994, when it was last hosted in America

It's a new era of English football under manager Thomas Tuchel. Or maybe it will just be more of the same. England and Gareth Southgate parted ways after the team lost the final of the 2024 Euros. It was hard to criticize the results Southgate achieved: consecutive Euro finals and a World Cup quarterfinal and semifinal appearance. But it was easy to argue with the team's performances during his tenure. Few teams were less imaginative in possession and less inspiring at goal scoring (given their talent) than Southgate's England. 

England had issues producing anything from the left side of the pitch in the 2024 Euros. The emergence of Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly as a hyper-versatile left back could be key to fixing this issue. The next challenge: Can Tuchel solve the fact that England's key attacking players—Kane, Jude Bellingham, Cole Palmer, and Phil Foden—so often like to occupy the same spaces? And will super-passer Trent Alexander-Arnold, fresh off a dream move to Real Madrid, now have a place on this team after the departure of Southgate, who never really favored him? There's a ton of talent and depth on this squad for Tuchel to tinker with, but England is still looking for the right chemistry and mix of attacking dynamism and defensive solidity.

 

Star man: Kylian Mbappé (Real Madrid)

Fact to know: France finished third in the 2025 UEFA Nations League, beating Germany on Sunday

France made it to the semifinals at the 2024 Euros but was still one of the most disappointing teams: They scored only four total goals across six games—and three of them were either own goals and penalties. Their recent Nations League performances against Croatia in the first leg of the quarterfinal and Spain in the semifinals won't do much to alleviate concerns about this team, either. At the moment, it looks as if the whole is less than the sum of its parts under manager Didier Deschamps. 

But the sum of the parts is truly an embarrassment of riches. In the Nations League semifinal, France started a front four of Mbappé, Désiré Doué, Michael Olise, and Ousmane Dembélé. Yet France trailed 5-1 at one point in the second half. Les Bleus will enter next year's World Cup as one of the favorites because, despite their recent struggles, they have an overwhelming amount of talent at both scoring goals and defending. But finding the correct balance has been difficult for France since the end of the 2022 World Cup. They should have no issues qualifying in a UEFA group with Iceland, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan, and it would surprise no one to see them lift the trophy next summer. But there is plenty to watch for between now and next June. 

Star man: Lionel Messi (Inter Miami)

Fact to know: Emi Martinez has gone 4-0 with Argentina in penalty shoot-outs in the past three international tournaments 

The only other team that has a convincing case for the top spot in these rankings is Argentina, the defending world champions. Argentina didn't just win the 2022 World Cup final against France but bookended that historic triumph with Copa Ámerica titles in both 2021 and 2024. Argentina is currently 10 points clear of second place in the CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers, and they've beaten Brazil both home and away en route to a comfortable qualification. South America used to be Brazil, Argentina, and everyone else. Now, it's just Argentina and everyone else. 

The biggest question mark for Argentina between now and next summer is the state of Messi. He hasn't committed to playing yet (let's be honest—he'll be there), but what will his level of performance be if he does? Argentina is one of the better defensive teams in the world, with just nine goals conceded in 16 qualifying matches, but Messi was their most important player in the 2022 World Cup. They won without a ton of contributions from him at the 2024 Copa, but their creative output did suffer as a result. 

Star man: Lamine Yamal (Barcelona)

Fact to know: Spain has had seven penalty shoot-outs since the 2018 World Cup and lost four of them, including in Sunday's Nations League final against Portugal

Spain was inarguably the best team at the 2024 Euros, winning all seven matches and beating heavyweights like Germany, France, England, Italy, and Croatia. Spain also beat France in a 5-4 thriller in the recent Nations League semifinal, and while they ended up losing the final to Portugal in a penalty shoot-out, they remain the top team on this list. The arrow for Spain continues to point upward, boosted by its ever-reliable midfield and dynamic young wingers. Yamal has announced himself as legitimately one of the best players in the world—maybe even the best—at the ripe old age of 17. 

The emergence of new Real Madrid signing Dean Huijsen as a reliable center back could be key given the issues Spain has had with consistency at that position in the past few major tournaments. Mikel Oyarzabal isn't the most traditional striker option, but he's been a solid goal scorer and creator for Spain, notching three goals and two assists in the final four matches of the Nations League. The return of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri at the base of the midfield won't hurt, either. It's a loaded roster with depth and superstar talent that should enter as the favorite.

A year and two days before its 2026 FIFA World Cup opener, the United States men's national team was booed off the field by its own fans in a half-empty stadium in Nashville. 

In a tune-up game for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup, which kicks off for the U.S. against Trinidad and Tobago on Sunday, the American dismantling at the hands of Switzerland was so comprehensive that the home team gave up more first-half goals (four) than it had in 40 years. Only Swiss disinterest in running the score up further in the second half seemed to spare the Americans—who registered zero shots on goal—from further humiliation than the 4-0 defeat. 

It was the fourth straight loss by the USMNT, its longest such streak since 2007, and a new nadir on the potholed road to the second World Cup to be played (mostly) on U.S. soil.

Exactly One Year to Go Until the 2026 World Cup 

Power Ranking the 52 Teams Most Likely to Play in the 2026 World Cup

What Will the World Cup Stand For in an Isolationist America?

FIFA's Club World Cup Is an Audacious Bet on Limitless Growth—and Greed

Two weeks earlier, Mauricio Pochettino, U.S. Soccer's high-profile head coach hire last fall, had sounded the alarm when he announced his initial roster for the monthlong Gold Cup preparation camp. Near the end of a session with the American soccer press assembled on Zoom, Pochettino, unprompted, threw a verbal haymaker at his team's culture. 

“What we want to create in our national team is people desperate to come but desperate to come to perform,” he said. “We only have time to train one, two, three times, play [a game]. One, two recoveries [sessions], and play. And then go home and maybe wait two months to be all together [again]. If you want to arrive to the camp, and you want to spend a nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friends—and that is the culture we want to create? No, no, no, no, no. What we want to do is be focused and spend all my focus and energy on the national team. We need to create this culture about winning and to chase our aim. If we want to be good in one year's time [at the 2026 World Cup], we need to think that today is the most important day.”

On Sunday, Pochettino repeated this edict in Spanish and added a flourish. “I want 11 lions or wolves—or whatever animal you like best and is the most aggressive​​—on the field,” he said. “That they fight as if lives are on the line.”

The USMNT's last camp back in March, ahead of the finals of the CONCACAF Nations League, another regional trophy, had been a debacle. The Americans had won all three of the maiden editions of that tournament beginning in 2019 but lost to Panama in the semifinal and Canada in the third-place match this time around. They were both narrow losses, but the USMNT looked disheveled, no longer an effervescently gifted young team on the rise but rather a loose collection of unfamiliar players, adrift and disinterested. 

“For us, we learned a lot in the last few camps, for sure in March,” said Pochettino. “And I think it's about to be [a] different approach.”

He wasn't alone in voicing his concern. “When we come back, some things need to change and we need to improve,” captain Christian Pulisic had said in March. “Obviously, the feeling is not good right now. We need to turn it around and we can hopefully build some momentum this summer, because we really do need it.”

Whatever momentum and credibility a young and inexperienced team had assembled in a sound performance at the 2022 World Cup, reaching the round of 16, had been squandered. Plainly, ditching Gregg Berhalter after last summer's disappointing Copa América, ending his underwhelming second spell in charge, did little to lift the cloud over this team, or help it bust out of its slump. Nor had the switch to the most high-profile coach the USMNT has ever employed fixed any of the team's issues—at least not yet. The attacking shortcomings, the glaring lack of feistiness, the habit of playing down to weaker teams, they had all survived the coaching change—making the uncomfortable suggestion that perhaps the ousted head coach, who was popular with the players but not exactly with the fans, wasn't the problem. Worse still, the vibes on a team that once prided itself on its closeness were now very obviously rancid. 

“It's like a crossroads that we have now,” said defender Chris Richards. “After March, we really kind of had to look inside of ourselves and figure out what was the problem.”

“I don't think there's any denying that some of our performances have fallen short over the past year to 18 months,” echoed fellow defender Walker Zimmerman. “It's something that, us as players, we obviously aren't satisfied with, and it's a big focal point for this camp.”

Meanwhile, time marches inexorably on toward the 2026 World Cup, kicking off exactly a year from today, which will mostly be played on home soil. As several recent classes of American talent—unprecedented in their upside and pedigree—pushed into the first teams of some of Europe's most laureled clubs, they were inevitably affixed with the “golden generation” label. By 2026, it was projected, they would hit their primes and coalesce, all of it culminating in some kind of signature achievement. Because the thing about a golden moniker is that it implies winning something. Or at least doing something.

This expectation is hardly lost on this team. “Whenever you have an opportunity to play in a home World Cup, you want to put on a show, you want to put on your best performance,” said midfielder and occasional captain Tyler Adams. “It's growing in stature and growing in confidence of the young team that we have, understanding the responsibility that we have and what it's going to take. I think everyone is going to be prepared for that moment. There's not a ton of games left, obviously, before the World Cup.”

There aren't. After this Gold Cup, just four separate nine-day international windows remain before the USMNT has to be ready for the real thing. That's 36 days in total, most of which will, as Pochettino pointed out, be lost to jet lag and match prep and recovery.

Yet instead of ironing out the last kinks and buffing the final blemishes on his team, Pochettino has had to hit a kind of hard reset. Now in his fifth camp in charge, he has called in no fewer than 59 different players. This turnover has partly been foisted on him by the absence of 10 regulars this summer—for reasons ranging from obligations in the Club World Cup, to injuries, and, in the case of Pulisic, a need for rest—but it also gives the head coach a chance not only to try out fringe players and find depth pieces, but also to rewire the team's mindset. 

“Things happen in soccer,” said goalkeeper Matt Turner. “And I think what we need to control is what we bring to the table every single day: the intensity, the way we push each other, the passion, the energy, the connection with the fans, with each other, with the staff. We're going to be together for a long period of time and it's a really good opportunity for us to put a lot of things together, tactically, technically, emotionally.”

Pochettino, for his part, reported being pleased with the early mindset he had observed in the first week of camp. “This attitude I want to continue for the future until we are right to the World Cup,” he said. “That is the only way that we can improve. If I decide in September a different roster, what I want is the same level of commitment, attitude—not to complain about this and that, not excuses.”

The current, uncomplaining roster, missing all those regulars, faced a pair of strong but hardly unbeatable European(ish) teams in Türkiye and Switzerland in preparation for the Gold Cup. Certainly, the opposition in the run-up to the tournament would be stronger than it was likely to be in any game during the tournament itself, complicating the judgment of the performances. Still, the judgment, over the span of the two games, would be damning.

Against the Turks, the U.S. looked much more spirited than it had in March and scored a goal in the very first minute through a Jack McGlynn curler from outside the box. But a pair of defensive miscues in their own box midway through the first half consigned the Americans to a 2-1 loss, despite a series of second-half scoring chances on a soggy afternoon in East Hartford, Connecticut.

Even in defeat, it was enough to spark some optimism. “The team showed great energy, great mentality, great attitude,” Pochettino said after the match with Türkiye. “That is why I think I am so, so happy about the way that we delivered a show, in a way that we tried to play so positive. For sure, playing in this way, we are going to win most of the games. Today, OK, bad luck.”

But just three days later, whatever psychological building blocks had been put in place quickly disintegrated. Pochettino made a raft of changes, further diluting a team already missing so much of its first-choice talent, and Switzerland's dominance over a disjointed and utterly unthreatening American team was total. Radical optimism would be no salve this time around. 

“At halftime, we tried to change the system and to provide more calmness to the team,” Pochettino said after the game. “I think in the second half, the team matched Switzerland in all the areas, and that is the positive thing that we need to take from today.”

Pochettino's continued positivity following a pair of sound defeats says something about a bar that has been lowered far beyond what anyone might have imagined after Qatar. Presently, the team looks and sounds like one that's in rebuilding mode, taking satisfaction from flashes of promise, from spring's first green shoots. But actually, it's a team barreling toward a seminal event that might very well bend the arc of the sport in the country. If that sounds hyperbolic, the team's slogan for the second World Cup cycle under Berhalter was no less than to “change soccer in America forever.”

But after three years of never-before-seen highs from a team that really does have more technical talent than any previous incarnation, interspersed by are-we-really-still-doing-this lows, there is little choice but to peer at the near future through rose-tinted glasses. Because the pessimist's vantage point is bleak.

“Obviously, you wish that you would win every game in the lead-up to the World Cup and you're flying with confidence,” said Adams. “But it's a double-edged sword, so to speak, isn't it? You could be winning a bunch of games that don't really matter and get to the World Cup and not really have the performance that you want. Or you can go through a period of adaptation, like we're going through right now, and struggle a little bit and realize what's in front of you and realize how valuable playing in a home World Cup is going to be. To be honest, I think we're right where we're supposed to be right now. We've struggled, we've gotten beat down, we've been pegged back a stone. Now we need to continue to prove that we are at this level and able to improve. There's room for improvement to be sure but I'd rather that than be perfect.”

Certainly, there is no imminent prospect of perfection in this iteration of the U.S. men's national team. But a program that has been counting down to next summer ever since June 13, 2018, when North America was awarded the 2026 World Cup, needs to fashion something out of itself that is at least passable. And very soon.

A year and two days before its 2026 FIFA World Cup opener, the United States men's national team was booed off the field by its own fans in a half-empty stadium in Nashville. 

In a tune-up game for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup, which kicks off for the U.S. against Trinidad and Tobago on Sunday, the American dismantling at the hands of Switzerland was so comprehensive that the home team gave up more first-half goals (four) than it had in 40 years. Only Swiss disinterest in running the score up further in the second half seemed to spare the Americans—who registered zero shots on goal—from further humiliation than the 4-0 defeat. 

It was the fourth straight loss by the USMNT, its longest such streak since 2007, and a new nadir on the potholed road to the second World Cup to be played (mostly) on U.S. soil.

FIFA's Club World Cup Is an Audacious Bet on Limitless Growth—and Greed

Two weeks earlier, Mauricio Pochettino, U.S. Soccer's high-profile head coach hire last fall, had sounded the alarm when he announced his initial roster for the monthlong Gold Cup preparation camp. Near the end of a session with the American soccer press assembled on Zoom, Pochettino, unprompted, threw a verbal haymaker at his team's culture. 

“What we want to create in our national team is people desperate to come but desperate to come to perform,” he said. “We only have time to train one, two, three times, play [a game]. One, two recoveries [sessions], and play. And then go home and maybe wait two months to be all together [again]. If you want to arrive to the camp, and you want to spend a nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friends—and that is the culture we want to create? No, no, no, no, no. What we want to do is be focused and spend all my focus and energy on the national team. We need to create this culture about winning and to chase our aim. If we want to be good in one year's time [at the 2026 World Cup], we need to think that today is the most important day.”

On Sunday, Pochettino repeated this edict in Spanish and added a flourish. “I want 11 lions or wolves—or whatever animal you like best and is the most aggressive​​—on the field,” he said. “That they fight as if lives are on the line.”

The USMNT's last camp back in March, ahead of the finals of the CONCACAF Nations League, another regional trophy, had been a debacle. The Americans had won all three of the maiden editions of that tournament beginning in 2019 but lost to Panama in the semifinal and Canada in the third-place match this time around. They were both narrow losses, but the USMNT looked disheveled, no longer an effervescently gifted young team on the rise but rather a loose collection of unfamiliar players, adrift and disinterested. 

“For us, we learned a lot in the last few camps, for sure in March,” said Pochettino. “And I think it's about to be [a] different approach.”

He wasn't alone in voicing his concern. “When we come back, some things need to change and we need to improve,” captain Christian Pulisic had said in March. “Obviously, the feeling is not good right now. We need to turn it around and we can hopefully build some momentum this summer, because we really do need it.”

Whatever momentum and credibility a young and inexperienced team had assembled in a sound performance at the 2022 World Cup, reaching the round of 16, had been squandered. Plainly, ditching Gregg Berhalter after last summer's disappointing Copa América, ending his underwhelming second spell in charge, did little to lift the cloud over this team, or help it bust out of its slump. Nor had the switch to the most high-profile coach the USMNT has ever employed fixed any of the team's issues—at least not yet. The attacking shortcomings, the glaring lack of feistiness, the habit of playing down to weaker teams, they had all survived the coaching change—making the uncomfortable suggestion that perhaps the ousted head coach, who was popular with the players but not exactly with the fans, wasn't actually the problem. Worse still, the vibes on a team that once prided itself on its closeness were now very obviously rancid. 

“It's like a crossroads that we have now,” said defender Chris Richards. “After March, we really kind of had to look inside of ourselves and figure out what was the problem.”

“I don't think there's any denying that some of our performances have fallen short over the past year to 18 months,” echoed fellow defender Walker Zimmerman. “It's something that, us as players, we obviously aren't satisfied with, and it's a big focal point for this camp.”

Meanwhile, time marches inexorably on towards the 2026 World Cup, kicking off exactly a year from today, which will mostly be played on home soil. As several recent classes of American talent—unprecedented in their upside and pedigree—pushed into the first teams of some of Europe's most laureled clubs, they were inevitably affixed with the “golden generation” label. By 2026, it was projected, they would hit their primes and coalesce, all of it culminating in some kind of signature achievement. Because the thing about a golden moniker is that it implies winning something. Or at least doing something.

This expectation is hardly lost on this team. “Whenever you have an opportunity to play in a home World Cup, you want to put on a show, you want to put on your best performance,” said midfielder and occasional captain Tyler Adams. “It's growing in stature and growing in confidence of the young team that we have, understanding the responsibility that we have and what it's going to take. I think everyone is going to be prepared for that moment. There's not a ton of games left, obviously, before the World Cup.”

There aren't. After this Gold Cup, just four separate nine-day international windows remain before the USMNT has to be ready for the real thing. That's 36 days in total, most of which will, as Pochettino pointed out, be lost to jet lag and match prep and recovery.

Yet instead of ironing out the last kinks and buffing the final blemishes on his team, Pochettino has had to hit a kind of hard reset. Now in his fifth camp in charge, he has called in no fewer than 59 different players. This turnover has partly been foisted on him by the absence of 10 regulars this summer—for reasons ranging from obligations in the Club World Cup, to injuries and, in the case of Pulisic, a need for rest—but it also gives the head coach a chance not only to try out fringe players and find depth pieces, but also to rewire the team's mindset. 

“Things happen in soccer,” said goalkeeper Matt Turner. “And I think what we need to control is what we bring to the table every single day: the intensity, the way we push each other, the passion, the energy, the connection with the fans, with each other, with the staff. We're going to be together for a long period of time and it's a really good opportunity for us to put a lot of things together, tactically, technically, emotionally.”

Pochettino, for his part, reported being pleased with the early mindset he had observed in the first week of camp. “This attitude I want to continue for the future until we are right to the World Cup,” he said. “That is the only way that we can improve. If I decide in September a different roster, what I want is the same level of commitment, attitude—not to complain about this and that, not excuses.”

The current, uncomplaining roster, missing all those regulars, faced a pair of strong but hardly unbeatable European(ish) teams in Türkiye and Switzerland in preparation for the Gold Cup. Certainly, the opposition in the run-up to the tournament would be stronger than it was likely to be in any game during the tournament itself, complicating the judgment of the performances. Still, the judgment, over the span of the two games, would be damning.

Against the Turks, the U.S. looked much more spirited than it had in March and scored a goal in the very first minute through a Jack McGlynn curler from outside the box. But a pair of defensive miscues in their own box midway through the first half consigned the Americans to a 2-1 loss, despite a series of second-half scoring chances on a soggy afternoon in East Hartford, Connecticut.

Even in defeat, it was enough to spark some optimism. “The team showed great energy, great mentality, great attitude,” Pochettino said after the match with Türkiye. “That is why I think I am so, so happy about the way that we delivered a show, in a way that we tried to play so positive. For sure, playing in this way, we are going to win most of the games. Today, OK, bad luck.”

But just three days later, whatever psychological building blocks had been put in place quickly disintegrated. Pochettino made a raft of changes, further diluting a team already missing so much of its first-choice talent, and Switzerland's dominance over a disjointed and utterly unthreatening American team was total. Radical optimism would be no salve this time around. 

“At halftime, we tried to change the system and to provide more calmness to the team,” Pochettino said after the game. “I think in the second half, the team matched Switzerland in all the areas, and that is the positive thing that we need to take from today.”

Pochettino's continued positivity following a pair of sound defeats says something about a bar that has been lowered far beyond what anyone might have imagined after Qatar. Presently, the team looks and sounds like one that's in rebuilding mode, taking satisfaction from flashes of promise, from spring's first green shoots. But actually, it's a team barreling toward a seminal event that might very well bend the arc of the sport in the country. If that sounds hyperbolic, the team's slogan for the second World Cup cycle under Berhalter was no less than to “change soccer in America forever.”

But after three years of never-before-seen highs from a team that really does have more technical talent than any previous incarnation, interspersed by are-we-really-still-doing-this lows, there is little choice but to peer at the near future through rose-tinted glasses. Because the pessimist's vantage point is bleak.

“Obviously, you wish that you would win every game in the lead-up to the World Cup and you're flying with confidence,” said Adams. “But it's a double-edged sword, so to speak, isn't it? You could be winning a bunch of games that don't really matter and get to the World Cup and not really have the performance that you want. Or you can go through a period of adaptation, like we're going through right now, and struggle a little bit and realize what's in front of you and realize how valuable playing in a home World Cup is going to be. To be honest, I think we're right where we're supposed to be right now. We've struggled, we've gotten beat down, we've been pegged back a stone. Now we need to continue to prove that we are at this level and able to improve. There's room for improvement to be sure but I'd rather that than be perfect.”

Certainly, there is no imminent prospect of perfection in this iteration of the U.S. men's national team. But a program that has been counting down to next summer ever since June 13 of 2018, when North America was awarded the 2026 World Cup, needs to fashion something out of itself that is at least passable. And very soon.

The German needs to find solutions - and fast - if England are to meet their supporters expectations and mount a serious challenge in North America

It's getting serious now. We're exactly one year away from the start of the 2026 World Cup and, for Thomas Tuchel, time is fast running out to construct an England squad that he feels is capable of flying out to North America and bringing the trophy home. By his own admission, and the length of his contract, that's the target, but judging by the last international camp of the 2024-25 season, the Three Lions are a million miles off being capable of navigating that final step and getting over the line at a major tournament.

If Andorra was bad, Senegal was worse. After delivering so many high points and memorable moments during the Gareth Southgate era, you could forgive England for a wobble in a World Cup qualifier that they ultimately won. What followed a few days later, though, and after a proper public dressing down from their manager too, was unacceptable. Friendly or not, Tuesday's disastrous showing at the City Ground shows just how much work needs to be done to put things right.

Hopefully the first defeat of the Tuchel era is the sobering wake-up call and reality check that the players need. Talked up, and rightly so, as one of the favourites to win the World Cup after reaching another Euros final, England have regressed, and significantly. Make no mistake about it, play anything like they have over the last two matches and the Three Lions will be lucky to make it through the group stages.

Vinicius Jr scores as Brazil book World Cup spot

Brazil qualified for the 2026 World Cup with a 1-0 win against Paraguay in South American qualifying to give Carlo Ancelotti his first win as manager. 

Real Madrid forward Vinicius Jr scored from close range in the second half, finishing after fine work from Manchester United-bound playmaker Matheus Cunha.

The victory, Ancelotti's first after a 0-0 draw against Ecuador on his debut last week, means Brazil have now qualified for every edition of the World Cup.

"We needed to win and qualify for the World Cup," said Vinicius Jr.

"Now the coach will have more time to work. Of course today wasn't one of our best performances, but the important thing is always to win. 

"Now it's time to celebrate qualifying."

Elsewhere, World Cup holders Argentina played out an entertaining 1-1 draw with Colombia in Buenos Aires.

Liverpool winger Luis Diaz opened the scoring with a fine individual goal, dancing through three defenders before finishing past Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.

Argentina were reduced to 10 men with 20 minutes remaining when Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez was sent off for a high-boot challenge on Colombia's Kevin Castano.

But Lionel Messi's side found an equaliser nine minutes from the end through Lyon's Thiago Almada, leaving Colombia four points clear of seventh-placed Venezuela. 

Ecuador, Argentina's nearest challengers, booked their spot at next summer's tournament in Canada, Mexico and the United States after a 0-0 draw away at Peru.

Club World Cup

Connections: Sports Edition

Today's News

Six months before the planned start of the Club World Cup came word that FIFA had finally found the grease to make its new wheels turn. A global broadcast partner had been secured and in its hands was the billion dollars that could be repurposed as a prize pot to demand the attention of the 32 competing teams.

FIFA called it a “landmark agreement”, the first of its kind. All 63 games in its expanded now-summer club competition would be made available free, with the body's president Gianni Infantino calling it the “most widely accessible club football tournament ever”.

The partner selected to make it all happen, though, raised eyebrows.

DAZN might consider itself the only global sports streaming platform, dubbed the ‘Netflix of Sport', but it was not a headline name for FIFA to have picked. In the United States and the United Kingdom, where it was founded in 2015, DAZN remains best known for boxing's big nights and pay-per-view events. In other parts of the world, including South America and Africa, it is unfamiliar to millions.

All that is set to change in what DAZN's chief executive, Shay Segev, has predicted will be a “transformational” year for the company. New audiences can be targeted and untapped markets explored. Or so goes the justification in giving FIFA $1billion (£736m) to screen a tournament of unknowns that will be over 29 days after it begins this weekend.

“We think it is good value for money,” DAZN's chief executive of growth markets, Pete Oliver, tells The Athletic at the company's headquarters in central London.”It's hard to know how big the Club World Cup will be, but we can see from the data already that it's not going to be small. It'll be big, it's just a question of how big.”

DAZN, like FIFA, needs this new competition to work. It is among the biggest plays in its relatively short history as an ambitious broadcaster and a roll of the dice designed to increase its footprint around the globe. It is part broadcast deal, part promotional campaign.

“We don't see it as a risk, we see it as a very big opportunity,” adds Oliver. “We think it will reposition the company quite significantly worldwide.”

DAZN — it's pronounced ‘da zone', for the uninitiated — has been a company of curiosity within the media industry since the platform was formed in 2015 as a product of Perform Group.

Owned and funded by Sir Len Blavatnik's Access Industries Group, its plans have always been grand, to the point of eventually redesigning the sports broadcast landscape. DAZN does not hide its prediction that live sport will eventually come to viewers through dedicated digital platforms, following trends set by the music industry.

It is why DAZN regards itself primarily as a tech company but, within the industry that it wants to dramatically alter, plenty point to accumulated losses in chasing that vision.

The group's most recent set of accounts, published in January, detailed funding commitments of $6.7billion from Blavatnik since DAZN's inception. There was $1.4bn lost in 2023 alone.

The stark balance sheet deficits are a result of continued expansion in the costly world of football. As well as hoovering up domestic rights deals in major European territories, partnering with Serie A in Italy, Bundesliga in Germany and La Liga in Spain, DAZN had been the home of the women's UEFA Champions League until the arrival of Disney+ into the marketplace last month. Rights costs in 2023 ($3.1billion) exceeded the company's annual turnover, which had at least grown to $2.9bn.

Blavatnik can wear the losses better than most. The Ukraine-born British-American businessman in control of DAZN had his wealth estimated to be $26.5billion by Forbes this year and is prepared to widen the company's frontiers.

Three days before Christmas — and a matter of weeks after FIFA announced the Club World Cup deal — DAZN announced it had agreed to buy Australia's Foxtel Group from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp for $2.2billion.

It was inward investment, though, that created greater headlines a month later.

SURJ Sports Investment, controlled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), bought a minority stake, said to be in single digits in terms of percentage, in DAZN for a reported $1billion to strengthen relations between the two.

Rights for LIV Golf, football's Saudi Pro League and the various sports under the Riyadh Season banner had already been bought by DAZN, but it was the timing of that $1billion investment, the same figure that would go to FIFA for the Club World Cup, that drew scepticism. A financial, mutually beneficial triangle can be drawn without any assistance between FIFA, Saudi Arabia — which was announced in December as host of the 2034 men's World Cup — and DAZN.

“The Club World Cup deal was done in December, Saudi investment came in February,” explains Oliver, who says negotiations with FIFA spanned between six and nine months. “At the same time, we also bought Foxtel in Australia for $2billion.

“There were various things happening in the group. The Saudi investment was for plans in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region, and the Club World Cup was a separate decision reached last year.”

Is the cynicism unfair? “I think it is,” he adds. “We've got a primary investor, Access Industries, which has funded the business with significantly more money than we've had from PIF. Multiple billions. We've had $1billion from PIF, but that's to launch in Saudi.”

FIFA, regardless, was grateful DAZN's money came when it did. There had long been talk of Apple stepping up to become a streaming partner for the Club World Cup, but there was a reluctance within the industry to back a competition with neither heritage nor guarantees of engagement. Infantino went as far as calling a briefing with global TV executives last September in an attempt to drum up interest.

“The money they've had to cough up for the Club World Cup is astonishing,” says Paolo Pescatore, a media and telecoms analyst with over 30 years of experience.

“This is about DAZN putting a marker in the ground and saying, ‘We want the mantle of being the global streamer of sports, and we're in a position to do it'. They'll see this as the tournament where they can do it, but, equally, there's a lot of hope in play here.”

This, too, is a first for FIFA. The men's World Cup, the governing body's greatest asset, continues to see rights sold region by region, but a club event lacking the prestige and history of the UEFA Champions League was instead bundled up and sold off as one.

“There was nobody but DAZN, so they made a beautiful story of it with this $1billion to calm the clubs,” says Pierre Maes, a published author on the sale of sport TV rights. “It's very convenient for FIFA. They sell to a broadcaster, who can broadcast the property in all of the countries but also, the broadcaster can act as an agency and sell the rights on to broadcasters.

“DAZN solved a big headache for FIFA, but this property has a lot to prove. This feels to me like an opportunity for DAZN rather than a big strategic move.”

DAZN has hedged its bets and opted against going it alone at the Club World Cup. Baked into the agreement with FIFA was the power to sublicense to regional markets, clawing back some of the initial investment. Deals have been struck with TNT in the U.S. and Channel 5 in the UK, ensuring a sizeable chunk of coverage will be shared with others. Channel 5, for example, will show the final and at least one semi-final among its broadcasts of the tournament.

Oliver says “hundreds of millions (of dollars)” have been recouped in that sublicensing process. “That brings in revenue but also helps promote the tournament,” he says.

Sluggish ticket sales in the U.S. would indicate promotion might be needed, but DAZN maintains that interest will not need to be manufactured. It sees the plot lines developing around Real Madrid, who will be led by new coach Xabi Alonso for the first time and include Trent Alexander-Arnold in their ranks, and the fiercely-supported clubs taking part, including Egypt's Al Ahly and the Argentine pairing of River Plate and Boca Juniors.

“We think the audiences for this will be very big — tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions,” says Oliver. “We think over 100 million people will watch the Club World Cup, and we believe we can drive a lot of ad revenue. You'll see big sponsors and big advertisers on the feeds worldwide.”

All 63 games of the Club World Cup will be available through DAZN's app, which is free to anyone who enters an email address and becomes a registered user. Paid subscribers (£24.99 a month in the UK, $19.99 in the U.S.) will see an uplift on their coverage, with improved picture and sound quality, while part of FIFA's arrangement is the incorporation of the body's in-house FIFA+ platform and all the content that it offers.

A nagging question is DAZN's ability to cope with a new scale of demand on its platform this summer.

Major problems were encountered during the screening of Serie A games in 2021 and 2022, with viewers seeing feeds buffer and cut out. That brought criticisms from the Italian government and apologies from DAZN, which has not been alone in finding streaming issues for the most in-demand events. Netflix's broadcast of the Jake Paul versus Mike Tyson exhibition boxing match in November was overshadowed by technical problems during the 65million concurrent streams. DAZN, though, has confidence in its platform bearing the weight of its biggest numbers.

“We've built a new version of our platform specifically for the Club World Cup for free customers, and we've simulated 300million people watching at the same time,” says Oliver.

“We've made big investments in infrastructure to be ready for this. You never say never in the world of technology but we're pretty confident. We've built the platform, but also we're providing commentary in 17 different languages, because we're doing it globally. It's on a scale that no one else in sport has done before.”

DAZN is nothing if not aspirational. In a company update from this January, Segev promised that DAZN was “only getting started” and that “ambitions are bigger than ever” in 2025. Forecast revenues have been set at $6billion for this year, doubling from 2023.

Then there is the long-term target, said out loud, to reach a billion global users within the next decade — or, put another way, one in every eight people currently on the planet using DAZN on some level. Spotify, for some context, says it has close to 600million users.

It is the scale of DAZN's plans, coupled with the heavy ongoing losses subsidised by Blavatnik, that is known to evoke the rolling of eyes.

“In our business, we have a lot of people looking at DAZN and asking themselves, ‘What the f*** are they doing?',” says Maes. “It's impossible to lose so much money. In the meantime, they are growing into one of the biggest companies in the UK.

“For the people who are trying to sell television rights, DAZN is an opportunity and a danger at the same time. It is an opportunity because in Europe today, it's the only ambitious sports-rights buyer. It's as simple as that. They're the only ones left. But it's a danger because these people have nearly $7billion of accumulated losses. Their future depends on the will of one man (Blavatnik) to put more money in.”

DAZN is not afraid to admit that football has to be central to its long-term growth. Eighty per cent of the app's viewing figures, it says, come from showing live matches.

It is why it will remain a domestic partner of Italy's Serie A until at least 2029 and why it extended its arrangement with Germany's Bundesliga until the same point. DAZN also struck a five-year deal as a local provider for La Liga matches in Spain in 2022. Less harmonious was the arrangement with France's Ligue 1, severed inside a year, but other domestic partnerships can be found in Japan and Belgium.

Those territories are where a substantial portion of DAZN's 20 million paid-for subscribers can be found. The Premier League, except for the rights to televise its games in Spain and Portugal, has eluded it.

Aside from the proposed acquisition of BT Sport in 2022, which would later be sold to Warner Bros Discovery and rebadged as TNT Sport, there has been little prospect of televising Premier League matches in the UK and breaking Sky's stranglehold. The fifth-tier National League is the only long-standing partner of DAZN in English football.

There are other key properties, including the NFL's Game Pass app in countries outside the United States, and a raft of boxing shows following link-ups with key promoters Golden Boy, Matchroom and Queensberry. The greatest challenge, however, is attracting and retaining subscribers.

“At the beginning of 2024, DAZN was talking about reaching break-even,” says Francois Godard, senior media analyst of Enders Analysis. “That was the message. And then, this winter, it changed. They kept the message that they are doing better, but the main message was expansion. It shifted from a focus on break-even to a message of expansion.

“There was the deal in Australia and then the deal with the Saudis. That is probably allowing them to do the deal for the Club World Cup, which will allow them to gain prominence in many other markets where they had a lower profile, like the U.S. That was a big change in emphasis.”

So, how significant do the Club World Cup's global rights become to a project of this scale?

“To them, it's a publicity operation to reach out to people who have never heard of them,” Godard adds. “They want to become a global platform, which is very tough in sports. The rights are almost always (sold) country by country. The Club World Cup will be free-to-air and it's a one-off.

“DAZN is a subscription service, so it needs subscribers all year round. But arguably there can be an overlap in terms of reach, and many platforms have a free tier where registration is required. Then it becomes easier to pitch a subscription to these customers.”

That is undeniably part of the long-term strategy. The data of sports fans this summer will have enormous value to DAZN, an intangible byproduct of the $1billion investment. Forging the first links with FIFA will also carry benefits should the Club World Cup broadcast model be successful enough to be scaled-up at an event such as the 2034 World Cup, which is being hosted by, let us not forget, Saudi Arabia.

DAZN will hope this is the start of something bigger with FIFA, but the path is not clear of competition. Netflix has already secured global rights for the Women's World Cup in both 2027 and 2031, and Disney's poaching of the UEFA Women's Champions League from DAZN next season illustrates the continued willingness of streaming giants to explore live sport.

DAZN likes to stress it remains the only dedicated global sport platform, and for all the industry reservations, it does not deviate from a strategy that will quicken with this summer's Club World Cup.

“We're pretty clear on where we're going,” says Oliver. “If you take a step back, you can see music has moved to a digital model. The sport industry hasn't got there yet.

“We're building a platform for that. We view that as a tech company, like YouTube or Spotify. We're building a platform.

“If you go forward 10 or 20 years, way more sport will be delivered through a single platform on a global platform. You can see the traditional model in decline. No one else is building a dedicated sports app. We think the end-game is that we become the global home of sport.”

The Club World Cup, for better or for worse, will go a long way to shaping DAZN's future.

Club World Cup

FIFA's latest attempts to fill Hard Rock Stadium for the Club World Cup opening match between Inter Miami and Egyptian team Al-Ahly involve offering students at an affiliated local college a single ticket for $20 — but with the promise of up to four complimentary tickets.

The Athletic last week revealed the launch game, which takes place on Saturday night, still had tens of thousands of tickets unsold for a match likely to star Lionel Messi for MLS side Inter Miami. Hard Rock Stadium has a capacity of 65,326. FIFA denied that fewer than 20,000 tickets had been sold for the match — insisting the number was “much higher” — but they did not specify the number.

Now, however, email promotions have been sent out to those connected to Miami Dade College, which announced a collaboration with FIFA in April 2024. This involves students being given the chance to intern at FIFA's Miami office, while FIFA's museum loans exhibits to the college. Miami Dade College has more than 100,000 students currently enrolled, according to the announcement made by FIFA of the partnership one year ago.

An email promotion sent out says that FIFA, in collaboration with Miami Dade College, is “providing up to four complimentary tickets to the opening match of the FIFA Club World Cup with the purchase of one ticket at the reduced student price of $20.” Those who respond are asked to submit their Miami Dade College email when using their purchase. If they secure the five tickets, then they are essentially able to watch Messi for just $4 a seat, which is a bargain for the local community but a long way away from FIFA's original expectations when pitching this tournament as the most coveted trophy in world club football.

As reported previously by The Athletic, FIFA has sold general sale tickets for the revamped 32-team Club World Cup under a dynamic pricing model, a system whereby prices fluctuate based on demand, and the slumping prices for certain games are indicative of FIFA's struggles to sell out stadiums.

As of last Tuesday, Inter Miami's game against Al-Ahly had dropped to $55, according to prices on Ticketmaster, the portal FIFA is using to sell tickets for the tournament. This was half of what they were available for in May, while tickets were $230 for the cheapest seat in January and $349 after the draw in December. FIFA is now hoping that the reduced prices will draw people in during a publicity blitz in the final week before the tournament.

Despite the $20 offer for the affiliated college, the cheapest seat available on Ticketmaster tonight was $69.15 for an “obstructed view.” It is not known how many tickets have now been sold for the game, but it is clear that FIFA is now taking every possible step to avoid any perception on Saturday night that the tournament is not in demand.

FIFA sources, speaking anonymously as they were not authorized to talk publicly on the matter, said that the organization has a strong relationship with the college and see it as a positive to extend the offer to their students to see world-class soccer on their doorstep.

Minimal changes

If you buy something from an SB Nation link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Preparations are now underway for the Club World Cup, which for us begins on Monday with a match against LAFC in Atlanta, with those players not involved on international duty returning from holidays and back to training at Cobham.

The squad will fly out to the USA only on Friday, and it's only then that we will know exactly who all will be traveling — at least for the group stage; we will get to make changes to the squad if (when) we get to the knockout stages.

But it sounds like we will be making minimal changes to the squad, and according to The Telegraph, only Andrey Santos will be added from among those who finished last season out on loan.  So that means the likes of João Félix, Renato Veiga, Axel Disasi, Raheem Sterling, Ben Chilwell, Armando Broja, Alfie Gilchrist, and many others will not be involved.  While part of that decision is surely to try to keep the squad size manageable, part of that is also a judgement on their futures (thus the inclusion of Santos).

EXCL: Goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic has not been included in Chelsea's Club World Cup squad. Chelsea have decided not to take any players who spent the season out on loan - other than Andrey Santos - as they see the CWC as a continuation of 24/25 campaign #cfc…

Perhaps most notably, Đorđe Petrović is expected to be left out as well, despite some rumors (hope?) that he will get a proper shot at the Chelsea goalkeeper job for next season.  Young Mike Penders is set to make up our numbers after the exit of Marcus Bettinelli.  Penders, like fellow new signings Liam Delap, Dário Essugo, and Mamadou Sarr, and unlike most of our loanees, is set to travel.

One new signing who is not expected to join is Kendry Páez, who's apparently already earmarked for a Strasbourg loan.

But we'll have to wait and see what the final list looks like on Friday.

Situation with Kendry Paez has changed. Player was expecting to go to the Club World Cup last week and then have his future decided. #CFC have determined he is not part of their squad, with a Strasbourg loan anticipated. Paez understood to be disappointed as summer plans… pic.twitter.com/StcTw6MzJf

Brazil officially qualified for the 2026 FIFA World Cup with their 1–0 victory over Paraguay.

Five days after only managing a goalless draw with Ecuador, Brazil kicked off in São Paulo with their sights set on securing their first victory under new manager Carlo Ancelotti. The Seleção's attack received a major boost with the return of Raphinha, who recorded 56 goal contributions for Barcelona in 57 appearances this past season.

Brazil dominated the early stages of the match and looked better in 15 minutes than they had all game against La Tricolor last week. Raphinha and Vinícius Júnior got involved from the opening whistle, putting the pressure on Paraguay to desperately defend two of the best wingers in the world. 

Yet Ancelotti's attack was missing the end product in the final third to find the back of the net. Just when it looked like the hosts would head down the tunnel without getting on the scoresheet, Matheus Cunha played a lovely ball across the face of goal to find Vinícius Júnior, who poked home just his seventh career international goal.

Brazil did not let up in the second half. The team looked completely revitalized after only managing two shots on target in Ancelotti's debut on the touchline. Despite completely controlling the game and creating dangerous chances, though, the Seleção could not find a second goal on the night.

Still, Vinícius Júnior's goal was enough to send Brazil to the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Ancelotti's men are now third in the CONMBEOL standings with 25 points, securing their place in the United States, Canada and Mexico next summer. The Seleção remain the only nation qualify for every edition of the tournament.

                Stephens hails the WTA's new fertility protection rule as a game-changer for women athletes            

The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has introduced a new rule allowing female players to take time off for fertility preservation procedures, like egg or embryo freezing, without sacrificing their place on tour. The regulation extends the association's growing support for women balancing career and family, following its earlier policy of offering up to 12 months of paid maternity leave.

The WTA said in a statement, “The new rule means that players can now take time away from professional tennis for a fertility protection procedure such as egg or embryo freezing and safely return to competition with a protected ranking.”

Players will receive a Special Entry Ranking (SER), calculated from their 12-week average ranking eight weeks before their break. This can be used to enter up to three tournaments within ten weeks of return, though not for top-tier events. Players who are ranked between 1 and 750 in singles or doubles and who are out of competition for at least 10 weeks in a row due to a “fertility protection procedure” are eligible.

The new rule will be open to any player ranked in the world's top 750 who spends more than 10 weeks out of competition 🎾🆕 pic.twitter.com/A51JttFT9N

Sloane Stephens, 2017 US Open champion, praised the policy as “groundbreaking.” A longtime advocate, Stephens revealed she's undergone egg freezing twice during the off-season. She told BBC Sport:

“The first time I did it, I rushed back, and I was overweight and not happy and just very stressed out. The second time I did it, I took a totally different approach so I could just be in better shape. I could have the surgery. I could have more time to recover. So having the protected ranking there, so that players don't feel forced to come back early and risk their health again, is the best thing possible.”

She also said, “The WTA has now created a safe space for players to explore options and to make the best decisions for themselves.” Further, the WTA confirmed that through its Maternity Fund, backed by the Saudi Public Investment Fund, financial grants will now help players afford fertility treatment.

This reform is the latest in the WTA's effort to support women beyond the court. Since 2019, mothers have been allowed to use their prior ranking in up to 12 tournaments within three years of giving birth. Now, similar consideration extends to players choosing to freeze their eggs.

As Stephens put it, the regulation lifts the pressure: “The regulation will lessen the pressure on athletes to return to the court too soon.” It's a shift toward a more compassionate sport, one where athletes can plan for the future without compromising their present.

Former runner-up Daniil Medvedev and former champion Adrian Mannarino will headline Day 4 of the ATP 250 in Den Bosch, with both players clashing for a place in the next round. Their match is among several exciting encounters as we approach the quarterfinal stage. We at LWOT offer our predictions on who will make it through.

Head–to–Head: Borges 1 vs 1 Virtanen

Otto Virtanen has been buzzing since the season switched to grass, winning six on the trot and capturing the title in Birmingham last week. He will look to continue his fine form against Nuno Borges, a player with whom he has traded wins.

With the Portuguese No. 1 looking to impact grass, expect a lengthy encounter full of strategic rallies as each player strives to gain dominance. Virtanen's strong serve will earn points, whereas Borges will aim to make the most of return games, maintain consistency, and take advantage of the quicker grass surface.

While Borges starts as the favourite, Virtanen has the tools to wrestle a win in this one. Give me the Finn to keep his solid momentum going on green.
Prediction: Virtanen in 3

Head–to–Head: Popyrin 1 vs 1 Bergs

Alexei Popyrin's bid to enter the world's top 20 for the first time kicks off with his first appearance on grass. The Australian is currently ranked 21, a career high, and will face Zizou Bergs in the round of 16.

The Belgian narrowly defeated his fellow countryman Alexander Blockx in a closely fought three-setter in the opener, and if he brings that performance into this encounter against the big-serving Aussie, there won't be an upset.
Prediction: Popyrin in 2

Head–to–Head: Medvedev 4 vs 3 Mannarino

Former finalist Daniil Medvedev will be pleased to have overcome his clay court struggles as he begins his grass season against former champion Adrian Mannarino. The Russian openly expressed his dislike for clay and has gradually evolved into a strong competitor on grass.

The top seed claimed the Mallorca title on this surface in 2021 and has reached the semifinals at Wimbledon in the last two years, both times losing to the eventual champion, Carlos Alcaraz.

Despite his pedigree, he faces a challenging opener against lucky loser, Adrian Mannarino, who trounced Christopher O'Connell 6-1 6-3 in the previous round.

Their most recent clash on grass was at Wimbledon two years ago, where the world no. 11 won in straight sets. However, this will not be an easy win, even though he should eventually advance.
Prediction: Medvedev in 3

Four more quarterfinal berths will be up for grabs at the ATP 250 in Stuttgart. Top seed Alexander Zverev returns to play his first warm-up tournament before Wimbledon. Who will reach the last eight?

Head-to-head: first meeting

Engel registered his second ATP win and both have come on home soil (he beat Jan-Lennard Struff in Hamburg). Tournament organizers were convinced of his talent to grant him a wild card and the 17-year-old impressed on his grass-court debut. Taking out a seasoned veteran like Duckworth on this surface is no mean feat. Michelsen, for his part, saw off Gael Monfils in an entertaining three-setter. While the age gap between the pair is not too big, Michelsen is more complete and has so much maturity to make this a comfortable afternoon.
Prediction: Michelsen in 2

Head-to-head: first meeting

Tien is another promising talent who won his first professional match on grass courts albeit via retirement. The 19-year-old was locked at one-set all against Yoshihito Nishioka when the Japanese lefty was forced to quit. It was Nishioka's fourth retirement in his last five matches. Not that Tien will care after his recent slump (lost three matches in a row coming to Stuttgart). However, this is a step up. Nakashima has made the second week of Wimbledon in the past and he's making a real push to make the Top 32 and achieve a seeding spot before this year's tournament.
Prediction: Nakashima in 2

Head-to-head: Auger-Aliassime 1-1 Mpetshi Perricard

Auger-Aliassime is a two-time finalist in this tournament. This will be his third appearance and first since 2021. The Canadian has had a tumultuous time on grass in recent years with three straight first-round defeats at Wimbledon. His last match win at a warm-up event on grass was at 2022 Halle. The most certain outcome here is that both players will at least rack up the ace count into double digits. But I'm giving the Frenchman a slight edge to come out on top. His potent serve is a serious X-factor that can turn around any match.
Prediction: Mpetshi Perricard in 3

Head-to-head: first meeting

Zverev is the top favorite for the title. He can complete a German double after lifting the Munich title in the clay swing. His record in this tournament is shabby, to say the least. His only win came a decade ago although he last featured in Stuttgart in 2019. Moutet has played a match in Stuttgart, getting a chaotic win over Fabio Fognini in the first round. Grass has been a tricky surface for Zverev, but his game translates to all surfaces. He should cruise here.
Prediction: Zverev in 2

The first tennis match he watched was the Dubai final in 2006 between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, and he has since been hooked into the sport.

COCO GAUFF is quickly squeezing in the taste of glory while she still can.

The new French Open champ served up a treat for herself as she returned to the USA for brief downtime ahead of Wimbledon.

And what better way to unwind than taking in a game with your favorite children's snack?

The American looked happy to share her sweet secret court-side as she watched New York Liberty take on Chicago Sky in the WNBA at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.

Gauff, 21, even gave it pride of place - as she perched her packet of Sour Patch Kids candy on her lap in front of a shoulder bag.

The tennis star smiled to a camera as she gave a peace sign at the women's basketball match - or was it a hint about how many candies she had already consumed?

Cool Coco was chic but casual - wearing a blue bomber-style jacket, ripped back jeans and New Balance sneakers.

An infinity chain topped off her fashionable appearance.

Alongside Gauff were brother Cameron and businesswoman Vanessa Bryant, the widow of NBA legend Kobe Bryant.

Her carb-high snack might intrigue some observers in these days of rigorous diet and training programs for elite athletes.

Likewise, popping back from Europe to the US before Wimbledon might also be seen as unusual. 

But it all suggests Gauff enjoys a healthy balance between a supreme regime of fitness and occasionally letting her hair down.

And if anyone deserves a break, it's surely the first-time winner of the French Open.

Gauff was also presented with a "25" Liberty shirt by their 27-year-old icon Sabrina Ionescu after they sunk Chicago 85-66.

She now has two Slams to her name, having also won the 2023 US Open.

Now Gauff will be confident of producing her best-ever run at Wimbledon.

The World No. 2 has never bettered reaching the last 16.

But doing so three times already at her tender age - in 2019, 2021 and last year - indicates she can be a consistent title threat for a decade or more.

Meanwhile, Gauff was "surprised" to hear World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka say the duo played "terrible tennis" in the Roland Garros final.

The beaten Belarusian hit 70 unforced errors and called Saturday's windy conditions a "joke" as Gauff battled back to triumph 6-7 6-2 6-4.

However, tearful Sabalenka did add: “Coco congrats. 

"In these tough conditions, you were a better player than me. Well deserved. You are a fighter and a hard worker."

Gauff responded by saying: "I'm gonna give her the benefit of the doubt.

"I'm sure it was an emotional day, emotional match."

And it should be easy for Gauff to deal with - as she loves things that are both sweet and sour!

The 2025 US Open will feature a new-look mixed doubles tournament, which could attract some of the biggest players in the men's and women's game.

It was announced earlier in the year that mixed doubles at the US Open would be completely rehauled ahead of the 2025 tournament.

The event will be played across two days on ‘fan week' with a unique rule set that may take some getting used to.

16 teams will compete in the tournament, eight of which will qualify through their combined singles rankings on the ATP and WTA Tours.

These changes have received mixed reviews, although it sounds like the player support is there, with many big names expected to sign up when tennis heads to New York in August.

One top WTA star has now responded when asked if she plans to play the event alongside her ATP Tour fiancée later this year.

During an interview ahead of the 2025 Queen's Club Championships, British number one Katie Boulter was asked whether she plans to play the US Open mixed doubles event with Alex de Minaur.

“You never know! I don't think we have ruled it out, but I don't think we have had a conversation about it. So something needs to change,” said Boulter.

“We do need to have a chat. I don't really know.”

The 28-year-old went on to explain that they don't need to make a decision right away.

“With this one, you can be quite spontaneous. It's a spur-of-the-moment thing,” she said.

“So, whereas all other tournaments, singles, doubles, you have a three-week entry deadline, and you have to do it before then. This one you can literally do the same week, sign in and hope for the best, so I do think it will be a very last-minute decision if we do play.”

De Minaur and Boulter have already played mixed doubles together, competing at the invitational Eisenhower Cup event at Indian Wells earlier this year.

Facing off against the American duo of Ben Shelton and Emma Navarro, Boulter and De Minaur fell short, losing 7-10.

Only time will tell if we will see Boulter and De Minaur return to the United States for some more mixed doubles action later in the year.

When the news broke that the mixed doubles event would undergo some pretty comprehensive changes, one of the discipline's most successful pairings spoke out.

Andrea Vavassori and Sara Errani, the defending US Open mixed doubles champions, expressed their disappointment in a social media post.

A post shared by Andrea Vavassori (@andrevavassori)

“In the last few weeks, we received the news that the US Open mixed doubles tournament will be completely turned upside down, cancelled, and replaced with a pseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show,” they said in a joint statement.

“A decision made without consulting anyone, which we can do nothing but accept. We see it as a profound injustice that disrespects an entire category of players. Putting money above tennis is never a good idea.

“We don't know at the moment if we'll have the chance to defend our title, but we hope this will remain an isolated case and this type of policy will not be considered again in the future. We strongly felt the need to share our thoughts, Sara & Andrea.”

Vavassori and Errani became the first-ever Italian mixed doubles champions at the US Open in 2024, when they beat the American duo of Taylor Townsend and Donald Young in the final.

Their thoughts aren't shared by everyone, however, as the outspoken Reilly Opelka gave his support to the US Open's decision, slamming the quality of doubles on social media.

“They should 100% get rid of dubs. It's for failed singles players,” he said.

Former world number one Andy Roddick was more cautious with his wording, but also expressed his support for the move.

“It's not as if I don't feel bad. Some of my best friends in the world [are doubles players],” said Roddick.

“But the arguments have to be based on fact or a new idea. You can't just use vague terms like we are not promoted. It's an old product that everyone knows about, which nobody watches. 

“I don't know if it will work, but it's something different to try opposed to just letting something bleed out.”

It remains to be seen whether the new US Open mixed doubles tournament will be a success or not, but it will certainly be worth tuning in for when the event begins on August 19, 2025.

Women's tennis players will now received protected rankings during periods where they undergo fertility treatment, according to a new announcement. 

The WTA, the sport's governing body broke new ground in March when they announced that they would be ensuring that their players would be eligible to receive maternity pay and 'comprehensive benefits' thanks to a new initiative between the organisation and their partner the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF). 

The controversial financial agreement with the Gulf state's sovereign wealth fund is just over a year old, and the initiative was the first of significance with the PIF as the tour's 'exclusive global partner'. 

An estimated 320 players on the women's tour became eligible for paid maternity leave of up to 12 months under the new regulations, as well as grants for fertility treatments, such as egg freezing, and additional benefits.

But the WTA have now extended their PIF WTA Maternity Fund Program to ensure that players undergoing egg or embryo freezing do not see their rankings under fire amid potentially seismic physical change. 

Former US Open champion Sloane Stephens shared her outspoken support of the programme as she opened up on her own experience of undergoing the challenges of playing through recovery. 

'The first time I did it, I rushed back and I was overweight and not happy - and just very stressed out,' Stephens told the BBC, sharing that she had undergone treatment twice during the off-season. 'The second time I did it I took a totally different approach so I could just be in better shape: I could have the surgery, I could have more time to recover.

'So having the protected ranking there, so that players don't feel forced to come back early and risk their health again, is the best thing possible.'

'It's all trial and error, everyone's body is different. Someone might be out for three months, someone might be out for one week.

'Some people gain a tonne of weight, some people can go back immediately. I think when you are family planning, it's better if you have that support.'

The protected ranking will be available to any of the top 750-ranked players, and allow them to compete in three tournaments with the special ranking within 10 weeks of returning to the tour. 

However, this will not extend to the tour's flagship tournaments, the Masters 1000s.  

WTA chief executive Portia Archer confirmed that the decision to enhance the existing program came at the request of the players in a statement shared by the WTA. 

Protected rankings are also available for players during pregnancy and postpartum for up to three years after giving birth. 

Although these protected rankings predate PIF's involvement with WTA, as independent contractors, female tennis stars have had few other financial protections when taking time out from the tour.

But the WTA's partnership with the PIF has not been without challenges, with players at the WTA Finals at the end of last year repeatedly asked to confront the seeming incompatibility of the deal due to Saudi's poor record on women's rights.

Eventual winner of the tournament Coco Gauff admitted that she had been 'concerned' when the location of the Finals had been announced, and that she had spent time talking to women in Saudi Arabia to discuss human rights issued ahead of participating.

With the Finals set to be staged in Riyadh for at least two more years, Gauff was also open that her participation would not be guaranteed if she qualified.

'If I felt uncomfortable or it felt like nothing's happening, then I probably wouldn't come back,' the former US Open champion added.

Coco Gauff is celebrating her 2025 French Open victory with a few surprise appearances around New York City.

Gauff received a standing ovation when she made a surprise appearance on a Tuesday night episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

Fallon celebrated by holding an audience vote on whether Gauff is "one of the greatest athletes living today," which received a unanimous thumbs-up.

Gauff also made an appearance at a Tuesday night WNBA game between the Chicago Sky and New York Liberty, where she again received a standing ovation from the crowd at Barclays Center.

"That was insane," Gauff said about the ovation during a mid-game interview with ESPN. "I wasn't expecting everyone to stand up. It just feels so cool to come back to such a warm reception."

She was then filmed visiting the Liberty locker room after the home team celebrated Gauff's first WNBA game by claiming an 85-66 win over the Sky.

Gauff claimed her first Grand Slam in New York back in 2023, when she defeated Aryna Sabalenka in the final in Queens.

The 21-year-old took on Sabalenka again at Roland Garros, where she recovered from an early deficit to win 6-7(5), 6-2, 6-4 last Saturday in Paris.

Gauff is the first American woman to win the French open since Serena Williams in 2015, and the youngest woman to win multiple Grand Slam titles on different surfaces since Maria Sharapova in 2006.

Coming down from high of Sunday's French Open final  …

• Here's the 50 thoughts from the 2025 French Open (doing business as Roland Garros) column.

• Here's the latest Served podcast. Andy and I will be back to regular episodes and then we'll do our Wimbledon draw show in two weeks. In the meantime, another thanks—periodically offered; but always felt—for your listenership/viewership.

Onward …

Jon, what was your favorite part of Sunday's wild and wonderful men's final?

Angela, NYC

• Can I give you five?

1) Simply the level. Not only did it seldom drop, but often both players were at their peaks simultaneously—just a breathtaking display of tennis. Go back and watch that tiebreak—the last eight or so minutes of the match. Five hours in and there was no drop-off in play.

2) Carlos Alcaraz's mental recovery. He had already lost the first set in multiple matches. But to lose the first two? Against the No. 1 player? Numerous hours later he served for the title at 5–4. He played a loose game. Jannik Sinner recovered. And five minutes after standing on the threshold of victory, he was serving simply to stay in the match? Then Alcaraz won that game and (shoutout to Martina Navratilova for this observation in real time) he then felt unburdened and dominated the match tiebreak.

3) Sinner actually won more points—befitting a match this close—193 to 192.

4) Sinner did not double-fault. In fact, he doubled only twice the entire tournament! (A discussion point—and I will ask Darren Cahill this—does that mean Sinner is eerily accurate? Or that he perhaps should go for more on his serves?)

5) The absence of controversy. The cliché is that when officials go unrecognized, they have done the job well. But chapeau tip to Eva Asderaki, the chair umpire. The players not only didn't complain, but they both conceded points and spared her trips down from the chair. There were no dubious bathroom breaks. No dubious time violations. This was breathtaking tennis married with impeccable sportsmanship.

Excellent, as always, kind sir. 

On the topic of pet peeves, is it possible to resurrect the correct term “runner-up”? Sinner was the runner-up today. 

Both he and Alcaraz were the finalists. Then after an all-time classic, we had a winner and a runner-up.

• I'm down. And what do you say we put “lucky loser” out of its misery while we're here?

Hola Jon!!

Thank you for your wonderful French Open coverage.

2025: Novak Djokovic, 38 years old, getting to the FO semis (very expected). 1991: Jimmy Connors, 39 years old, getting to the US Open semis (a total surprise run)…both at almost the same age. In your opinion, what changed? Between these two eras.

Best regards.

Carlos Acosta

• Good week for Team Carlos A!

Great question. Connors made that run to the semifinals at 39 years old in 1991 and it's a national story, prompting anti-aging jokes etc. Djokovic makes a run to the semis in 2025 and we ask: Can he win Wimbledon? 

There's a book to be written or documentary to be made on this question. Staccato answers: Sports science. Sports technology. The infusion of wealth that enables players to hire teams and fly private. Schedule management. It stands to reason that each generation will play longer than the one before it, learning from their missteps, availing themselves of greater technology, etc. (Notice that Djokovic needed weeks, not months—never mind years—to return from knee surgery last summer.) 

But, also, let's not sell Djokovic short. His professionalism, commitment and will is perhaps singular.

Jon,  

Is it just me, or are tennis fans around the world disappointed at [Aryna] Sabalenka's remarks after losing to [Coco] Gauff at the French Open? To say that Coco lost because she made so many unforced errors and not because Coco played well, and to add insult to injury say that Coco would have lost to [Iga] Świątek had Świątek defeated Sabalenka in the semifinal match, notwithstanding the fact that Coco defeated Świątek 6–1, 6–1 in their last clay court match, was not only in poor taste, it says a lot about Sabalenka as a person.  I think Coco handled the remarks well in her response.  …These are my perceptions.

D.H., Tennessee

• Here's where I stand on Sabalenka:

A) She's great. A generational player. Generous of spirit. Her return from the yips to winning majors is one of the great sports accomplishments. She has gone from see-ball, hit-ball erratic to a reliable late-round habitue. Love the lack of inhibition. This was not her finest moment/day but cut her slack.

B) We—and I am as guilty as anyone here—want it both ways. If we like the unfiltered personality and the absence of talking points—and we do—we must consider that sometimes there's a flipside to brutal, unmediated candor.

C) When athletes speak or act immediately after competition, it calls for grace. They've been exposed. Their stress hormones are bubbling. Roger Federer crying on Rafael Nadal's shoulder. Players forget to thank spouses. Intemperate remarks. In 1995, Steffi Graf won the title, stood before the crowd, smiled … and then forgot her French and said, “Mon chapeau est bien.” (My hat is good.) We need to extend grace here.

When Sabalenka stood with the runner-up, er, finalist, trophy and declared her play “terrible,” it might not have been the epitome of grace. But she gets a pass. (And she did have all those errors. No one is arguing her level dropped in the final, though one would also think the opponent had a causal connection in that drop.)

D) Here's where she lost the room and plot. After a cooldown period—when she had time to gather her thoughts and emotions—she went to the press conference and doubled down, continuing not only to denigrate her performance and offer scant praise to the winner, and even take these potshots. “I think she won the match not because she played incredible, just because I made all of those mistakes.” 

Then there was this: “I mean, honestly, sometimes it felt like she was hitting the ball from the frame. Somehow, magically, the ball lands in the court, and you're kind of on the back foot. It felt like a joke, honestly, like somebody from above was just staying there laughing, like, ‘Let's see if you can handle this.'”

Calling an opponent “lucky” is weak. Especially when said opponent won 119 points. How many of those were frame jobs or lobs that, unexpectedly, landed in? Six, maybe? Then, weirdly, she volunteered that Iga Świątek would have beaten Gauff.

E) Never mind that fans were upset. The opponent was upset. Here was a crowning achievement of Gauff's career and she was visibly taken aback. Choosing her words cautiously, Gauff said: “I mean, I don't agree with that. I'm here sitting here [as the champion]. No shade to Iga or anything, but last time I played her I won in straight sets. I don't think that's a fair thing to say, because anything can really happen.”

F) Let Sabalenka live. None of us should be judged by our worst day. People tie themselves in knots; they can also untangle themselves. Her postmatch postmortem Saturday was unsporting and ungracious. She deserved to be called out. She was called out. She effectively apologized. Let's move on. One hopes she doesn't lose her cork-popping personality. And when she wins Wimbledon next month, we'll all look at this, chuckling, the way we looked at her tossing rackets in the dustbin in the 2023 U.S. Open cooldown room.

At the risk of being canceled … Sabalenka made 70 unforced errors—70!—in three sets and was still in a position to win. Dare I say if a male player made that many errors in three sets he would have been dusted in straight sets. Would love for you to prove me wrong with stats if you can. 

Thank you, 

Dominic C. NY

• No cancellation. But I don't know about that. First, there's something circular here. If you're dusted in a best-of-three match, you're not in a position to commit 70 errors. And if a male player faced a persistent, No. 2–ranked opponent … who played with a singular ability to prolong points … forcing the opponent to go for smaller margins … in a high-stakes match which amplified pressure … with lots of games going to deuce … with some ungenerous stats-keeping … strictly as a hypothetical, I can see it happening.

I was watching the French Open final today with [well-regarded former NBA player] and his family—good thing too because they never would have figured out the fifth set super tiebreaker. Not that anyone knew.

JB, PDX

• A) Anyone else notice the rapturous roar followed by whaaaa when Alcaraz won his seventh point. This is not a conventional tiebreaker. Gradually we'll get accustomed to that.

B) Kudos to the four majors. The uniform first-to-10 shootout in the decisive set is the way to go, a brilliant way to end a match. It's not a crapshoot and the sample size is up from best-of-seven. But it spares us the absurdity of winning by a two-game margin.

Hi Jon,

I have been a long-time reader of your excellent mailbag (since approximately 1998). I also listen to the Served podcast. I am a Canadian who emigrated from Russia back in 1995. I know that in both mailbag and podcast settings, you are now staying quite apolitical. However, your suggestion that USTA should pursue Victoria Mboko representing the US is remarkably tone-deaf, at least to your Canadian readers. Threats to Canadian sovereignty from your current leader have significantly altered the political landscape in Canada, resulting in one of the most remarkable turnarounds in political history. At some point, the ongoing political climate in the US is bound to catch up with what you and Andy are covering. 

Best regards, Vladimir Ivanov

• Point taken. I'd take that back if given a second serve. To be clear, I am anti-jingoist. The tennis world is flat. Players change countries. Federations subsidize players on the condition they switch nationality. Fans root for players, not the flags next to their names. This is to the benefit of the sport, though it erodes the meaning/esteem/value of Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup. 

My point: As long as we are now in a world where countries and federations pick off players and nationality are fungible, the USTA might as well get in the game. (Imagine a Billie Jean King Cup composed of all the players with a base in Florida and California.) 

But, taking a radical political stance, I'm documented Team Sovereignty. Hands Off Canada. Congrats on Mboko. She is a gem. 

Random mailbag Q, inspired by [Andre] Agassi and [Jim] Courier on the TNT desk and which you might be able to learn given your access: Do ex-players ever get on the court and compete in private, ala the end of "Rocky 3" when Rocky and Apollo get into a ring at an empty gym?

@nickcurious2

• If it ain't pickleball, Agassi isn't playing.

HAVE A GOOD WEEK, EVERYONE!

Plus: What can we expect from some second-week finishers at Wimbledon?ByJoel DruckerPublished Jun 11, 2025 copy_link

Published Jun 11, 2025

Winning is the desired outcome that we can't control. But as Gauff has repeatedly demonstrated, competing is the process that one can hold ownership of every single minute.Gauff's forehand and serve have inspired enough dialogue to trigger a decade-long teaching conference. Put that aside and let us now praise her career-long superpower: No one in tennis competes better than Gauff. This surfaces not just in the rallies, but also in between points. Turn the clock back 44 years. On an extremely blustery day, Tracy Austin lost the first set of the 1981 US Open final to a powerful opponent, Martina Navratilova, 6-1. From there, Austin dug in, won the next two sets in tiebreakers and, like Gauff, earned her second Grand Slam singles title.The asset that carried Austin to that victory was the same one that worked for Gauff: positive body language and keen mental focus, as she went about the business of solving one problem after another.

Today, playing Aryna, I was just, like, ‘I just gotta go for it and try my best to get through the match.' Yeah, that's what I did. Coco Gauff

“Obviously I think the first [Grand Slam singles title] was maybe more emotional,” said Gauff, “but I think this one was just harder because, you know, you win one, and you just don't want to get satisfied with just that one…Today, playing Aryna, I was just, like, ‘I just gotta go for it and try my best to get through the match.' Yeah, that's what I did.”There are those who say that the ability to compete effectively cannot be taught. I'd say it is an abdication of responsibility on the part of parents, instructors, coaches and many others. For surely, a positive attitude like Gauff's can be learned, can't it? And while she brings her own distinct temperament into competition, Gauff was also taught such values as grit, poise and grace by her parents, and was therefore open to learning yet more from others.To earn the title in Paris, Gauff also beat the winners of the last two majors, Australian Open champion Madison Keys and US Open titlist Sabalenka. Knowing that could further boost Gauff's confidence as she heads to Wimbledon—the Slam where Gauff first hit the pro radar six years ago, but also the only major where she's never gone past the round of 16.

Gauff won her second Grand Slam final over Aryna Sabalenka, again rallying from a set down to lift the trophy.

The good news for Sabalenka is that she's reached seven singles finals this season, including each of the year's first two majors. The bad news is that she's lost both. So though Sabalenka remains ranked No. 1, this is akin to leading the league in batting average but hardly being the MVP. In Melbourne, Sabalenka encountered Keys in a zone. Fair enough, as it's plausible to treat such an outcome as a one-off.But at Roland Garros, Sabalenka lost the battle in a far more emotional and tactical manner. From the minute she began to see her first set lead of 4-1, 40-love unravel, much of the old, highly temperamental Sabalenka surfaced. Give the mental progress she's made in recent years, it was a disturbing sight to see how a choice to be so agitated concurrently triggered ill-informed tactical decisions.As one example, Sabalenka lost so much faith in her approach-volley sequence that she hit drop shots far more than viable—a fatal tactic versus an opponent as fast as Gauff (even more so on a windy day, when it's that much harder to calibrate a drop shot's placement). And though she rallied well to level the third set and even earn a break point when Gauff served for the title at 5-4 in the third, Sabalenka was repeatedly unable to effectively blend power and accuracy.

Coco handled the conditions much better than I did and fully deserved the win...She was the better player yesterday, and I want to give her the credit she earned. Aryna Sabalenka, in a statement posted to social media

As for Wimbledon, Sabalenka has twice reached the semis there. In 2024, she withdrew with a shoulder injury. Could the grass prove her breakthrough major of the year? Yet eager as Sabalenka is to move forward, instead of tossing what happened at Roland Garros into a trash bin, might she study what happened: This was a defeat triggered to some degree by the negative energy she projected through most of this match. Soon after came such unsporting Sabalenka remarks about how terribly she'd played, giving minimal credit to how Gauff had broken up her game.I think she won the match not because she played incredible,” Sabalenka said, “just because I made all of those mistakes from—like, if you look from the outside, kind of like from easy balls.”With a day to reflect, Sabalenka put out an Instagram post apologizing for her comments. “Coco handled the conditions much better than I did and fully deserved the win,” wrote Sabalenka. “She was the better player yesterday, and I want to give her the credit she earned.”Perhaps Sabalenka might also be pleased to know that, following that tough loss to Austin, Navratilova went on to win four US Open singles titles.

Considering how distraught Iga Swiatek has appeared for much of 2025, her semifinal run at Roland Garros was, if not triumphant, at least reasonably redemptive. A fourth-round victory over Elena Rybakina showed Swiatek's finest competitive qualities. There followed a sound win over the tenacious Elina Svitolina. But then, hoping to reach the finals in Paris for the fourth straight year, Swiatek came across a highly proficient Sabalenka.“Obviously looking at the math, I lost many points right now, but I know that it doesn't really matter,” said Swiatek following that match. “Like, any of us can win these tournaments. We kind of start every tournament from the beginning. So I'm just going to try to do my job and focus on, like, just getting progress and learning new stuff on grass right now.”A few weeks ago, I opined that, in her quest to rekindle her love of the game, Swiatek should go coach-free for a while. That likely won't happen. On a more micro basis, my idea is that Swiatek refine her serve. I've never been a fan of the motion, a technique I believe makes the delivery predictable and attackable—as proven when Swiatek won a scant 35 percent of second serve points versus Sabalenka. All this said, only traces of what Swiatek showed in Paris give me significant confidence in her possibilities for a deeper than usual Wimbledon run.

Global as tennis can be, at Grand Slam events that are attended by vast thousands who scarcely know much about tennis, national pride often carries the day. Let's also keep in mind the last time a Frenchwoman won the singles title came 25 years ago, when Mary Pierce raised the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen (unfortunately, a ceremony to honor Pierce was cancelled when she withdrew due to personal reasons). It's been 14 years since a Frenchwoman even got to the semis (Marion Bartoli).Which leads us to Loïs Boisson. Most times in life, surprise poses danger. Not in sports, though, as proven this year by Boisson's enchanting journey to the semis. Granted a wild card, the 361st-ranked Boisson—ranked No. 152 a year ago, but subsequently sidelined by a left knee injury—kicked off her first-ever main draw Slam appearance with a fine victory over 24th-seeded Elise Mertens. But week two was where she took even bigger strides, defeating top tenners Jessica Pegula and Mirra Andreeva. This was the classic case of a free-swinging contender happy to savor the moment and ride the crest of a wave. Or was it simply the culmination of a long road back to proficiency?“No, I don't think it's a miracle,” Boisson said following her quarterfinal win over Andreeva. “For sure, I have a little bit of luck also, but I think it's just, as you said, the hard work that I put since I started playing tennis and also last year with my rehab and everything. It's just result of hard work. Nothing else.”Boisson's massive forehand and many adroit shots wowed the fans, disrupted her opponents, and rocketed her 296 spots up the ranks to 65. Boisson's significant pro tennis journey has only just begun.

History is not always written by the winners. All four quarterfinal losers in Paris were surely frustrated by their defeats—but also figure to make their share of headlines at Wimbledon. Andreeva may have withered in the face of an inspired Boisson and a highly partisan crowd, but certainly that experience will help her continue to mature emotionally. Keys, surely happier than ever in the wake of having earned her first singles major, was toe-to-toe with Gauff until the third set of their quarterfinal. Her game is tailor made for Wimbledon.Svitolina, a revitalized competitor in the wake of her homeland being invaded, continues to impress in these late stages of her career. “I feel that I have a good chance to play good tennis,” said Svitolina following her quarterfinal loss to Swiatek, “to challenge the top players for the titles and some tough matches. I have this belief, and I want to continue working.”And Qinwen Zheng has now reached the quarterfinals or better at every major save for Wimbledon. Her power baseline game is also suitable for the grass.6. Early Exits: Downward or Upward?Emma Navarro, Karolina Muchova and Barbora Krejcikova, three versatile stylists who've all cracked the Top 10 at various times, collectively won a single match at Roland Garros this year. While Muchova and Krejcikova were each coming back from injuries, Navarro lost her opener to 68th-ranked Jessica Bouzas Maneiro by the shocking score of 6-0, 6-1. How do those Roland Garros losses affect each contender's mindset coming into the grass season?Perhaps they can be swiftly discarded. Krejcikova has only played three matches this year. Muchova, on her good days a next-stage version of Ash Barty, continues to struggle for consistency. And Navarro, who reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon and the semis at the US Open, has many points to defend in the months to come.Hopefully, each of these engaging competitors can draw strength from a statement once made by Billie Jean King: There are no failures. Only feedback.

Roland Garros has just shut its doors for another year, but Wimbledon is right around the corner.

Carlos Alcaraz fought back to beat Jannik Sinner in the men's singles final at Roland Garros, despite his opponent having three championship points.

The Spaniard is also a two-time defending champion at Wimbledon, with Alcaraz beating Novak Djokovic in both the 2023 and 2024 finals.

Despite finishing as runner-up both of the last two years, Djokovic could still have a chance at Wimbledon. 

However, a current top 20 ATP player's chances at Wimbledon appear to be in doubt after he withdrew from an upcoming grass court tournament.

One of the most memorable matches at Roland Garros this year involved promising young Frenchman Arthur Fils, who won a four and a half hour match against Jaume Munar.

The French crowd were raucous on Court Suzanne-Lenglen as they cheered on the French number one, who appeared to be struggling physically after winning only two games in the third and fourth sets.

These concerns were then confirmed after Fils withdrew from his next match against Andrey Rublev due to a stress fracture in his back.

When Fils spoke to press after his withdrawal, he suggested that this was a recurring back problem and revealed that he could be out for four to six weeks.

With Wimbledon just under three weeks away, the world number 14 has now withdrawn from his upcoming grass court tournament in Halle.

Fils has now been replaced by Belgian Zizou Bergs, who will take his place for the ATP 500 tournament that is also set to feature Jannik Sinner, Alexander Zverev and Daniil Medvedev.

When Fils revealed that his back injury is reoccurring, he was subsequently asked in his press conference whether it would require surgery.

In his response, the 20-year-old claimed that he did not think surgery would be required, but also could not confirm if he would be able to play Wimbledon and suggested that the hard court season was his priority. 

“I don't think I'm going to have to undergo surgery,” said Fils. “I don't think so. It's a good question, but I don't think so.

“As for the grass season, as I said earlier, I don't know yet. We'll see if I can be ready for Wimbledon. I'm not sure. We'll see. It's on hold for the moment.

“It will take time. I'm only 20 years old. I don't want to be in a hurry on the tour. I don't need to ramp up everything. I need to be ready for the hard court season, for the end of the year, and this is for the best.”

Fils achieved his best result at Wimbledon last year, reaching the fourth round before losing to Alex de Minaur.

He now faces a race against time to be fit for the grass court major that begins on Monday, June 30.

Wimbledon has long been a major sporting event in this country and 7.5 million people tuned in to watch last year's final.

Carlos Alcaraz came out on top on that occasion after beating Novak Djokovic in the men's singles final.

The new rule means players can now take time away from professional tennis for a fertility protection procedure such as egg or embryo freezing and safely return to competition with a protected ranking.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The WTA has introduced a new measure that provides ranking protection for WTA athletes who choose to undergo fertility protection. The development and adoption of the Fertility Protection Special Entry Ranking Rule has been championed by WTA players and delivers a further enhancement to the existing package of benefits empowering players to combine professional sport with family life.

The new rule means players can now take time away from professional tennis for a fertility protection procedure such as egg or embryo freezing and safely return to competition with a protected ranking. Eligible players will receive a Special Entry Ranking (SER), which can be used to enter up to three tournaments, based on the 12-week average of their WTA Ranking from eight weeks prior to the start of their out-of-competition period.

By introducing this new form of ranking protection, the WTA helps to support and empower women athletes to balance a professional sports career with planning and starting a family at a time of their choice.

The rule expands the WTA's comprehensive Family Focus Program, which includes ranking protection during pregnancy, or another means of parenthood, and postpartum support with a return to play. WTA athletes now also benefit from paid maternity leave and grants for fertility protection through the PIF WTA Maternity Fund. In addition, the WTA offers support for players' physical and emotional wellbeing via a team of dedicated health and wellness professionals.





 WTA
                        

Sloane Stephens, the winner of eight WTA singles titles, commented: “I'm incredibly proud of our sport in recognizing the importance of fertility treatments for female athletes. For any woman, the conversation of family life versus a career is nuanced and complex. The WTA has now created a safe space for players to explore options and to make the best decisions for themselves. It's truly ground-breaking and will empower this generation, and future generations of players, to continue with the sport they love without having to compromise.”

Portia Archer, WTA CEO, said: “We understand that professional athletes can face a dilemma between focusing on their career and starting a family, and we are committed to supporting WTA players as they navigate and balance the choices associated with career and family. After hearing from players that the option of fertility protection offers a proactive way to balance family goals and career ambitions, we're delighted that this new measure, alongside the fertility grant offered by the PIF WTA Maternity Fund, will contribute to enabling our athletes to realize their full potential and become parents at a time of their choice.”

Carlos Alcaraz has been celebrating his historic French Open win in Ibiza with a forgotten Premier League star.

The Spanish tennis maverick pulled off one of the greatest comebacks the sport has ever seen when he came from two sets down to beat world No 1 Jannik Sinner at Roland Garros on Sunday.

Alcaraz, 22, somehow saved three championship points in the fourth set before going on to stage a stunning fightback to win 4-6 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (10-2).

The final will go down in history as the longest-ever at the French Open, lasting a total of five gruelling but brilliant hours and 29 minutes.

The Spaniard has now flown to Ibiza to celebrate his triumph, despite Wimbledon commencing in less than three weeks, where Alcaraz will aim to win the championships for the third successive year.

During his brief spell away from the court, the five-time Grand Slam champion has been pictured with ex-Tottenham and Manchester United star Sergio Reguilon.

Reguilon, who was recently released by Spurs after five years at the club, shared a snap of himself posing with Alcaraz on the party island to his Instagram.

The story reads 'tradiciones', which means 'traditions' in English. The pair are believed to be very close and celebrated Alacaraz's Wimbledon success together last year.

Ibiza has a reputation for its nightlife, regularly packed with party-goers seeking to let loose deep into the night with the background of house music.

However, Alcaraz and Reguilon do not appear to be there to club, but rather to enjoy the gorgeous landscape away from the frivolous activities of the old town.

When first arriving in Ibiza, Alcaraz may have expected to have an excessive amount of money at his disposal to enjoy the holiday as the Spaniard's fifth grand slam title earned him €2.55million (£2.13m) in prize money.

However, he could be set to lose a huge portion of his winnings due to heavy French taxation laws. 

He could reportedly lose approximately 30 per cent of his earnings, potentially around £639,000.

Tennis stars are taxed differently to many sports, with players paying taxes depending on the location where they earn the money regardless of their nationality, according to My Tennis HQ.

'After the players pay taxes to the local government where the prize money was earned, they do not have to pay income tax on it again when they return back home,' the publication explains.

French Open stars split a prize pot of £47.3m, with runner-up Sinner receiving €1.27 million (£1.07M). Meanwhile, Alcaraz has already earned over £30m in career earnings, picking up £2.8m this season before his Roland Garros prize.

However, in the past Alcaraz has admitted that he doesn't tend to spend big after victories, just opting to buy a 'new pair of sneakers'.

But sneakers are nowhere to be seen as he posed with Reguilon, opting for some suede loafers to go with his two-piece outfit.

Dive deep into the extraordinary career of tennis sensation Carlos Alcaraz.

At just 22, this Spanish prodigy has already etched out a legendary path. We take a look at his roots in Murcia, how many times he's lifted the Wimbledon trophy and his impressive Grand Slam haul.

Plus, his Olympic medal aspirations, his current relationship status, and the wins that pushed him to World No. 2. 

Tennis Head has everything you need to know about Alcaraz ahead of an exciting summer of tennis.

Carlos Alcaraz is 22 years old, having been born on May 5, 2003. He grew up in El Palmar, a suburb of Murcia, Spain. 

His father, a former tennis player and academy director, introduced him to the sport at a very young age at the Real Sociedad Club de Campo de Murcia. 

Alcaraz has a great Wimbledon record, especially considering his relatively short career so far, having won two Wimbledon singles titles. 

In 2023, he beat Novak Djokovic in a thrilling five-set final to claim his first Wimbledon crown. 

A year later he defended his title, again beating Novak Djokovic in the final, this time in straight sets. This means he has a 90% winning percentage at Wimbledon, which is exceptionally high. 

He has quickly established himself as one of the top grass-court players on the ATP Tour.

A post shared by BMW (@bmw)

Carlos Alcaraz has stated that he is currently single. He has openly discussed the difficulties of maintaining a relationship due to his demanding travel schedule as a professional tennis player.

While he has been linked to other individuals in the past, such as Maria González Giménez and Emma Raducanu, he has not confirmed any relationships.

Carlos Alcaraz made his Olympic debut at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. He had a very successful first appearance in the Men's Singles event, reaching the final and securing a silver medal. 

His journey to the final included several remarkable victories before a hard-fought gold medal match against Novak Djokovic.

In Men's Doubles, Alcaraz teamed up with compatriot Rafael Nadal, forming a highly anticipated partnership. 

They demonstrated strong chemistry on the court and had a respectable run, reaching the quarter-finals before their elimination.

Australian Open: Quarter-finalist in both 2024 and 2025. He has not won the title yet, but he always reaches the latter stages.

French Open: Won in 2024 and defended his title in 2025. He also reached the semifinals in 2023 and the quarter-finals in 2022.

Wimbledon: Two-time champion, winning in both 2023 and 2024, defeating Novak Djokovic in both finals. 

US Open: Won his first Grand Slam title here in 2022. Reached the quarterfinals in 2021 and semifinals in 2023.

Carlos Alcaraz's ascent to World No. 2 has been fuelled by a series of victories at the sport's biggest events.

His breakthrough came with the 2022 US Open title, his first Grand Slam, which propelled him to World No. 1 as the youngest ever. 

That same year, winning ATP Masters 1000 titles in Miami and Madrid further cemented his rise.

In 2023, he claimed his second major at Wimbledon, defeating Novak Djokovic. He also secured another ATP Masters 1000 title in Indian Wells and successfully defended his Madrid Open crown.

The 2024 season saw him win the French Open and defend his Wimbledon title, consistently performing at the highest level. 

His strong start to 2025, including defending his French Open title and winning the Monte-Carlo Masters, continues to solidify his position at the top.

As of June 2025, Carlos Alcaraz's calculated net worth is between $40 million and $45 million. 

This valuation stems from his significant career earnings, totalling over $44 million in prize money from his five Grand Slam titles and numerous ATP Tour victories. 

Outside of playing tennis, Alcaraz also earns a lot of money from big deals with well-known brands.

He is a global ambassador for major brands like Nike (with a reported 10-year deal worth $15-20 million annually), Rolex, BMW, Calvin Klein, and Louis Vuitton.

Carlos Alcaraz's coach Juan Carlos Ferrero has spoken out after the five-time Grand Slam winner jetted off to Ibiza to celebrate his remarkable success at Roland Garros. The Spaniard came from behind to beat Jannik Sinner in the French Open final, playing out one of the most memorable matches in history.

The 22-year-old saved three championship points before going on to secure a 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2) win and retain his title. Following the triumph, it soon emerged that Alcaraz planned on celebrating in style.

He is set to enjoy a three-day trip in Ibiza before turning his attention to the grass season, having enjoyed a similar short break last year after winning his first French Open title.

Speaking about Alcaraz's plans, Ferrero revealed that he has spoken with the tennis superstar and reminded him about the upcoming schedule, telling El Laguero: “He's switching off. Yesterday I told him to have a good time because he deserved it, but to remember that he is a tennis player.

“We know how he is, these days suit him well, he'll come back refreshed and in a good mental state. It's not just about partying but about disconnecting, not thinking about tennis and being with his friends like any other 22-year-old kid.

"He does go on vacation, but only occasionally. He's not there every day, as people think. He'll return to work with motivation.”

Following Alcaraz's impressive win, Ferrero spoke about how he did not believe it was possible for the Spaniard to come from so far behind to land the title over the weekend. He explained: “In the third [set] also a break down after losing two sets, when you sit on the chair you start to think that maybe Jannik didn't lose a set and I'm two sets down, it's going to be very difficult to come back.

“But I think his strength is to keep believing all the time until the last ball is gone and he tries and tries. He was 0-40 in the fourth, 5-3 and he looked at me and he still makes like this with the racket, still saying we are still here, still saying vamos. I am not going to say I was believing that he was able to recover from this, 5-3, 0-40. But with Carlos everything is possible and he did it again. Amazing achievement.”

Roger Federer's Management Firm Faces Another Setback as Top Players Depart

In a shocking turn of events, Roger Federer's management firm, Team8 Management, has been hit with another high-profile departure. Ben Shelton, a rising tennis star, has announced his split from the Swiss icon's company, following in the footsteps of former client Coco Gauff. This double blow comes as a major setback for Federer and his long-time agent Tony Godsick, who co-own the management firm they founded back in 2013.

Shelton, who is gearing up for Wimbledon later this month, has made a surprising move by signing with talent agency WME (William Morris Endeavour), which also owns IMG (International Management Group). Joining the ranks of stellar tennis stars like Carlos Alcaraz, Serena Williams, and Iga Swiatek, Shelton is set to make waves in his new representation.

Meanwhile, Coco Gauff, fresh off her recent French Open victory, has taken a different path by establishing her own venture, Coco Gauff Enterprises, with the backing of WME. The 21-year-old phenom expressed her excitement about the new chapter in her career, emphasizing her passion for making a broad impact beyond just tennis.

Despite the departures of Shelton and Gauff, Federer's influence in the tennis world remains strong. The Swiss maestro's connection to Shelton through their shared sponsorship by Swiss apparel company On Running highlights the reach of Federer's brand even after his retirement from the sport nearly three years ago.

Former French Open champion Michael Chang praised Federer, along with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, for revolutionizing the culture of tennis. According to Chang, these tennis icons transformed the locker room environment, fostering a sense of camaraderie and respect among players regardless of their ranking or status in the game.

As Federer faces yet another setback in his management firm, the tennis world watches closely to see how the legendary player navigates these challenges and continues to inspire the next generation of tennis stars.

And Gauff hasn't showed up alone, bringing her mini replica of the Suzanne-Lenglen cup along for the appearances.“I didn't know it was going to be as small as it is," she told “TODAY” co-hosts Savannah Guthrie and Craig Melvin.“It is adorable. It's mini-size, like the little mini-brands, so that's what this is. It looks just like the real one, just smaller.”

Gauff later flexed the hardware in her late-night television debut by crashing the end of Jimmy Fallon's monologue on “The Tonight Show” to a standing ovation.Audience members unanimously voted 217 to 0 in deciding that “Coco Gauff is a national treasure and one of the greatest athletes living today.”

The glittering homecoming didn't stop there. Gauff enjoyed a long-awaited first WNBA game from a courtside view with her youngest brother Cameron. The two sat next to Vanessa Bryant and her family in watching the New York Liberty sink the Chicago Sky.When Gauff was shown on the jumbotron, the Barclays Center exploded into a frenzy.“That was insane!” reacted Gauff with ESPN's Holly Rowe. “I wasn't expecting everyone to stand up. It just feels so cool to come back to such a warm reception.”

On “Good Morning America” with Robin Roberts, the world No. 2 said of the whirlwind, “I think the main piece of advice everyone's told me is to take it in and soak it in, and then when it's time to get back to work, get back to work.”Tennis rarely stops, and so that work will resume soon with a surface switch to grass. Gauff is currently slated to play the WTA 500 in Berlin next week among a field that includes Sabalenka, defending champion Jessica Pegula, 2024 Wimbledon finalist Jasmine Paolini, Zheng Qinwen, Mirra Andreeva and Australian Open title holder Madison Keys.

Aryna Sabalenka has been under fire for her remarks about Coco Gauff following her loss in the French Open final.

The 21-year-old American dazzled on Sunday, overcoming the world No. 1 with a score of 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 6-4 to secure her first-ever title at Roland Garros.

Sabalenka stirred controversy with her post-match comments, suggesting that if Iga Swiatek – whom she defeated in the semi-finals – had reached what would have been her fourth straight final in Paris, she would have beaten Gauff. Despite issuing an apology on social media, Sabalenka still faced criticism for her conduct.

Rennae Stubbs, the former coach of Serena Williams, was among the prominent voices disapproving of Sabalenka's actions, calling her press statements "so bad" and expressing disappointment even after the belated online apology. "I love Sabalenka, but I don't know anymore," Stubbs said.

"Like, it took her 24 hours after that to write an apology, essentially, on Instagram. But I'm like, girlfriend. No. That was so bad, and there's no excuses for it. Like, there's just none. No, no, no. And that's coming from me who, as I said, I've said some stuff in press. Like, you never take it away from your opponent."

After lifting the trophy, Gauff confidently responded to Sabalenka's earlier suggestion that Swiatek would have been a tougher final opponent, chuckling: "I mean, I don't agree with that. I'm here sitting here."

She reminded everyone of her recent triumph over Swiatek at the Madrid Open, stating: "Last time I played – no shade to Iga or anything, but I played her and I won in straight sets. Yeah, I don't think that's a fair thing to say, because anything can really happen.

"Yeah, honestly the way Aryna was playing the last few weeks, she was the favourite to win. So I think she was the best person that I could have played in the final. Her being No. 1 in the world was the best person to play, so I think I got the hardest matchup just if you go off stats alone."

Later, Gauff addressed Sabalenka's post-final remarks with grace, reports the Express. She gave her the benefit of the doubt due to the emotional nature of the day.

"I mean after that I was a little bit surprised about the comments and everything, but I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt," she said.

"I'm sure it was just an emotional day, an emotional match, and every time I play Aryna, she's a fighter. She's a tough opponent. I think we're like 6-5 in the head-to-head, so it's very close."

However, not everyone was as sportsmanlike towards Sabalenka, with The Real Housewives of New York reality TV star Ubah Hassan delivering a scathing critique.

She left a biting comment on a video of Sabalenka's remarks: "No mistake was made, darling your lip filler just got in the way of your vision.??????"

Alexander Zverev has fired back at German tennis pundits Boris Becker and Barbara Rittner after criticism following his French Open exit.

World No 3 Zverev's hopes of a first Grand Slam title were dashed by Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals of Roland Garros, the Serbian defeating the German 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 last week.

It was the first time since 2020 that Zverev had failed to reach at least the semi-final of the event, and extended his wait for an elusive major.

The 28-year-old's career was put under the microscope on German TV following his defeat, with tennis icon Becker, a six-time Grand Slam winner, and Billie Jean King Cup captain Rittner among those sharing their thoughts.

Becker and Rittner were critical of Zverev's approach to the match, but a large focus was on the German's coaching situation.

Both former pros suggested that he needed to move away from his father, Alexander Sr, and brother Mischa.

“At some point you need new noises and a new environment. It's the same in football, as a football coach you don't normally stay with a club for 10 years,” commented Becker.

“He [Zverev] is the one who decides. He is the chairman of the board, the CEO. He decides what Team Zverev will look like in the future. His father and brother did an excellent job, but it wasn't good enough for the final step.”

Following a short break, the world No 3 returns to action at the Stuttgart Open this week, looking to ramp up his grass-court preparations ahead of Wimbledon.

And, asked about both Becker and Rittner's comments, the three-time major finalist was quick to counter their claims.

“When things are going well for me, I always do everything right,” said Zverev.

“When things are going badly for me, everyone else is very, very clever. Unfortunately, Boris is one of them, and so is Barbara Rittner.

“I don't know why she [Rittner] suddenly has so much to say about my tennis career. To be honest, I don't take her opinion seriously. Firstly, because of that, and secondly, because I think she's wrong.

“I lost to Djokovic. Maybe it wasn't my best match, but I thought he played very well – it was just difficult.

“And to be honest, I talked to Boris a lot, had a lot of contact with him before he made those statements. Before this crew had all that to say, I had a great relationship with him. I don't know why it all has to be like this now.”

Zverev was speaking ahead of his opening match in Stuttgart, with the German set to face mercurial Frenchman Corentin Moutet on Thursday.

And, despite disagreeing with Becker's comments, he insisted that he would always be willing to talk to the world No 1 to discuss their issues.

He added:  “I will always talk to him [Becker] if he wants to talk to me.

“In every relationship, whether it's with a partner or someone else, there are issues to argue about. This is perhaps one of ours at the moment.

“I still have enormous respect for him. He is an absolute legend, not only in sport, but in Germany in general, and also worldwide. I will always listen to what he has to say.

“But I don't always have to agree with him.”

Among those let go were vps Leigh Malleus, Karen Naff and Gary Keffer.


As MCA continues to fine-tune its Nashville operation under new president/CEO Mike Harris, the company has laid off nearly 20 employees in a round of staff cuts across multiple departments.


	Among those let go are several high level executives including Leigh Malleus (vp of media marketing), Karen Naff (vp of creative services) and Gary Keffer (vp of strategic marketing), as well as Michelle Hall (senior director of marketing), Troy Scott (senior director of e-commerce) and Leah Ducey (senior director of digital marketing).


	Also impacted are Megan Youngblood (director of regional promotion), Kathryn Huffman (director of strategic marketing), Alyssa Logan (director of marketing & project management), Lindsey Terry (director of marketing & artist development) and Chance Maxwell (director of streaming marketing), Sarah Marie Burke (A&R manager), Chandler Stebbins (strategic marketing manager), Chris Jones (e-commerce & retail manager), Kaitlin Mays (digital marketing manager), Alex Mazza (marketing project coordinator) and Taylor Steele (media marketing coordinator).

	Representatives for MCA and parent company Universal Music Group (UMG) either didn't respond to a request for comment or declined to comment, but sources say the new MCA will operate as a smaller, more focused unit than the former iteration of the label previously known at UMG Nashville did under former chairman/CEO Cindy Mabe, who was let go in January.


	During her two-year tenure, Mabe greatly expanded UMG Nashville, including launching a comedy imprint, Capitol Comedy Network, as well a distribution and independent artist services arm, Silver Wings Records, and a TV and film production company called Sing Me Back Home Productions. She also moved the company into live production by partnering with Cirque du Soleil to present Songblazers: A Journey into Country Music.


	Harris, who was named president/CEO in February, will work alongside chief creative officer Dave Cobb and Rob Femia, who added COO to his duties as executive vp of business and legal affairs earlier this month, as well as executive vp/GM Katie McCartney.


	Since Harris returned to UMG Nashville (which rebranded as MCA in April), UMG's coastal labels have continued to add to their footprints in the country music capital. In April, Los Angeles-based Interscope Geffen A&M (IGA) Records announced the relaunch of the iconic Lost Highway imprint, which had previously been part of UMG Nashville until 2012, when it went dormant (though Mabe had reactivated it with producer T Bone Burnett right after Former Thirty Tigers executive Robert Knotts and Universal Music Group Nashville (UMGN) executive Jake Gear will serve as co-heads and executive vps of the resurrected label.  


	In May, former Big Loud executive Candice Watkins was named president of Capitol Records Nashville and executive vp of Capitol Christian Music Group.


	Watkins' new role comes as Los Angeles-based Capitol Music Group, under the direction of CEO Tom March, brings Capitol Christian Music Group (CCMG) and its country division, Capitol Records Nashville, under the Capitol Music Group Nashville umbrella. 


	MCA's imprints include EMI Records Nashville, Lucille Records, Mercury Nashville and MCA Nashville, representing artists including Eric Church, Keith Urban, Carrie Underwood, Chris Stapleton, Dierks Bentley, Alan Jackson and Little Big Town.

	The devastating news that Brian Wilson has died at age 82 hit early Wednesday afternoon, and we're all in a state of shock. “We are at a loss for words right now,” his family wrote in a statement. “Please respect our privacy at this time as our family is grieving. We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world.”


	Wilson had been in failing health for quite a long time, and the family revealed he was suffering from dementia last year, requiring a conservatorship to handle his affairs. But it somehow seemed like he'd live forever after everything he'd survived throughout his long and difficult life. He was one of rock & roll's ultimate survivors, somehow outliving both of his brothers, Carl and Dennis, by more than a quarter-century.


	In the late Nineties, Wilson stunned fans by hitting the road as a solo act for the first time in his career. He was backed at the shows by a group of Beach Boys super fans, the Wondermints, who lovingly recreated the lush, complex arrangements of the original Beach Boys recordings with amazing precision.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“We really wanted to do the music justice,” Wondermints multi-instrumentalist Probyn Gregory told Rolling Stone in 2024. “I think everyone gave it their A-plus shot, and really focused, and really tried to emote, and tried to break down the fourth wall as much as we could. We wanted to make sure that we gave [Brian] as solid a bed as we possibly could so that he could thrive.”

	











	A couple of years into the run, they started playing Pet Sounds straight through with local symphonies. Shortly after that, they shocked the world by resurrecting Brian's lost 1967 masterpiece Smile, both on the road and in the studio. It was a peak moment that was impossible to top, but Wilson and the Wondermints continued to tour heavily practically every single year throughout the 2010s and early 2020s, pausing only for the brief Beach Boys reunion in 2012, and Covid in 2020.


	The final tour was a double bill with Chicago in the summer of 2022. It was a difficult time for Wilson, who often seemed distant and unengaged onstage, leaving his band — including original Beach Boy Al Jardine — to carry much of the weight.

	“It was a little tough,” Gregory told Rolling Stone. “We've seen that over the years, that sometimes he's really pumped and all there and ready to do a show. At other times he's scared and he's heard voices or he's just not feeling up to it. And I'm afraid to say that a lot of 2022 he wasn't feeling up to it…. People love to ring the bell and extol his virtues when he's on, and that's great. But when he's not engaged, it can seem really bad. And I feel bad for everyone. The audience, they want to get the good Brian, and we in the band want everyone to be pleased, but we can't control everything.”


	The last show took place July 26, 2022, at Pine Knob Music Theatre in Clarkson, Michigan. Like every show on the tour, it was heavy on Beach Boys classics like “God Only Knows,” “Good Vibrations” and “Sloop John B.” But there were also deeper cuts, including “Long Promised Road,” “Sail On, Sailor,” and “Wild Honey.”

	Check out fan-shot footage of “California Girls,” “Good Vibrations,” and several other songs from the show. It's sad on some level, since Wilson is clearly struggling, and he barely participates in “Good Vibrations.” But take a look at at the joyous crowd perched near the stage, singing along to every word of those all-time classic songs and having a blast.


	Brian was dealt many difficult hands in life, including a brutish father and severe mental illness. But he spent the last few decades of his life watching music that he created spark joy in thousands of people, night after night. That's a pretty magical way to go out.

Earlier this year, Trace made a public plea for help for his dad after Billy Ray's inauguration performance. 


							By 

	Lexi Carson



Trace Cyrus has put his dad, Billy Ray Cyrus, on blast. 


	On Tuesday, Trace, a musician and older brother of Miley Cyrus, took to Instagram to call out his dad, Billy Ray — again. However, this time, it's because he said his dad didn't go to his grandma's funeral so that he could attend a fashion show. 




	“This man is so hungry for fame it's pathetic. He really flew to Italy for a fashion show but wouldn't come to L.A. for Mammie's funeral while he was still married to my mom. Even after his daughter [Miley Cyrus] got him a 60k private jet like he demanded then he still didn't come even after the plane was paid for,” he wrote. “You're the lamest man to ever walk planet Earth. Honestly embarrassed to ever have considered you my idol.”

	In January, Trace posted an open letter on Instagram calling for help for his dad after Billy Ray's performance at President Trump's inauguration went viral as there were many audio technical difficulties that Billy Ray appeared to have a hostile reaction to. However, after he did so, Trace said Billy Ray threatened him with legal action.


	“Pappy is looking down at you with such disappointment I can assure you. You should be ashamed of yourself,” Trace said. “I will always love you but I no longer respect you as a man. Everyone close to you is terrified to tell you how they really feel. I'm not. Get help.”

	Great early heat here on James Gunn's Superman: Fandango is reporting that the Amazon Prime Early Access screenings for the film have become the ticket retailer's best first-day advance tickets seller of 2025, outselling all other movies' general first-day ticket sales year to date — including Disney/Marvel Studios' Fantastic Four: First Steps. By the way, these are tickets that Amazon Prime Members paid for, they aren't free. 


	Prime early access tickets are available exclusively through Fandango. Early screenings for Superman will screen in select theaters on July 8 at 7 pm local time—three days before the film's nationwide release in theaters and IMAX on July 11.

Zoe Saldaña is making a statement: Her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for “Emilia Pérez” identifies as “trans.” Saldaña, who won the statue for playing a lawyer who helps a cartel boss (Karla Sofía Gascón) undergo gender-affirming surgery, told People that the award “goes by they/them.”

“We have it in my office and my Oscar is gender fluid,” Saldaña said. Saldaña later likened her Oscar win to being “the World Cup of acting,” at least as her sons Zen, Bowie, and Cy with husband and filmmaker Marco Perego understand it. Saldaña also had won a BAFTA, a Critics Choice Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her role in “Emilia Pérez.”

The controversial film was nominated for a slew of Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Lead star Gascón, who is trans, was nominated for Best Actress as well. 

Saldaña isn't the first Best Supporting Actress winner to refer to her Oscar as they/them. Jamie Lee Curtis supported her trans daughter Ruby in 2023 by saying her “Everything Everywhere All at Once” Oscar is part of the push to have genderless awards categories, much like what the Gothams pioneered. 

 










When asked during the “Today” show by co-host Savannah Guthrie if Curtis had “named her,” in reference to the statue, Curtis said that the statuette is genderless as a statement for transgender rights.

“I'm in support of my daughter Ruby. I'm having them be a they/them,” Curtis said. “I'm going to just call them ‘them.' They/them, and they are doing great, they're settling in, and I just, in my life, I never saw it in a million years that I'd have these couple days, and I'm very moved by the whole thing.”

She previously had addressed non-gendered awards categories while backstage at the 2023 Oscars. 

“The bigger question is how do you include everyone when there are binary choices, which is very difficult, and as the mother of a trans daughter, I completely understand that,” Curtis said. “And yet to de-gender the categories, I'm concerned that will diminish the opportunities for more women, which is something I've been working hard to promote. The most important thing is inclusivity and more women…basically just more fucking women anywhere, anytime, all at once.”

Brian Wilson, who as leader of the Beach Boys and a founder of California rock invented a massively successful pop sound full of harmonies and sunshine, has died at the age of 82.


	“We are heartbroken to announce that our beloved father Brian Wilson has passed away. We are at a loss for words right now,” his family wrote in a statement posted on social media. “Please respect our privacy at this time as our family is grieving. We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world.”

A post shared by Brian Wilson (@brianwilsonlive)


	Wilson's family did not provide a cause of death, but it was revealed in February 2024 that the Beach Boys legend was battling dementia.


	“Brian gave so much to the world through his music, his spirit and his strength. He was a sweet, gentle soul as well as fierce competitor,” Wilson's longtime manager Jean Sievers said in a statement to Rolling Stone. “There will never ever be anyone like him again. God truly broke the mold when he created Brian Wilson. Besides being a creative genius, he was one the smartest and funniest people I've ever known. His message of love will live on through his music forever.”

	











	Wilson's legacy includes dozens of hit singles with the Beach Boys, including three Number One singles (“I Get Around,” “Help Me, Rhonda,” and “Good Vibrations”). In the 1960s, the Beach Boys were not only the most successful American band, but they also jockeyed for global preeminence with the Beatles. And on albums such as Pet Sounds, Wilson's lavish, orchestral production techniques dramatically expanded the sonic palette of rock & roll and showed how the recording studio could be an instrument by itself.

	Born June 20, 1942, Brian Wilson grew up in Hawthorne, California, a modest town next to the Los Angeles Airport. Brian was the eldest of three brothers; his younger brothers were Dennis and Carl. Their father, Murry, was an aspiring songwriter and a tyrant. “Although he saw himself as a loving father who guided his brood with a firm hand, he abused us psychologically and physically, creating wounds that never healed,” Wilson wrote in his 1991 autobiography, Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story.

	Wilson grew up playing sports and obsessing over music, teaching his brothers to harmonize with him. Music was his sustenance and his solace, he said: “Early on, I learned that when I tuned the world out, I was able to tune in a mysterious, God-given music. It was my gift, and it allowed me to interpret and understand emotions I couldn't articulate.”


	In 1961, Brian, Dennis, and Carl formed a band with their cousin Mike Love and their friend Al Jardine, managed by Murry Wilson; Brian played bass, took many of the lead vocals, and wrote the songs. Signed to Capitol Records and named the Beach Boys, they started to roll out hits like convertible Thunderbirds coming off an assembly line: “Surfin' U.S.A.” (with music borrowed from Chuck Berry's “Sweet Little Sixteen”), “Surfer Girl,” “Be True to Your School,” “Fun, Fun, Fun.” Those Brian Wilson compositions all sounded like insanely catchy jingles for the California teenage lifestyle — surfboards, hamburger stands, pep rallies — but on the flip side of the good times was a real sense of melancholy. Sometimes that was apparent in the lyrics — the lonesome “In My Room,” for example — and sometimes it was expressed nonverbally, with the Beach Boys' heartbreaking multipart harmonies.


	Wilson got more ambitious in his songwriting and experimented with new sounds—like the chunky surf guitar and falsetto lead on “I Get Around.” But he buckled under the stress of touring, having a nervous breakdown on the road in Europe in 1964. He decided that while the other Beach Boys toured the world, he would stay home and work on perfecting new material in the studio: When the band came back to California, they would step in and lay down their tracks. The results included gorgeous singles such as “California Girls” and the immortal 1966 album Pet Sounds.

	The album, which regularly ranks at or near the top of the best albums ever made (Rolling Stone named it Number Two in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time), was inspired by the Beatles' innovative work on Rubber Soul; in return, it inspired the Fab Four to new heights of experimentation on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Paul McCartney frequently cited Pet Sounds as a masterpiece, giving it particular credit for its innovative bass playing, and has called the aching “God Only Knows” his favorite song of all time. The album was orchestrated with instruments that included harpsichords, bicycle bells, and barking dogs. The culmination was “Wouldn't It Be Nice,” with its lyrics yearning for an adult life and love.

	











	The other Beach Boys, particularly Mike Love, were not impressed by Pet Sounds, and Wilson considered releasing it as a solo record; as a Beach Boys album, it was only a middling success in the States, although its influence was huge and it was recognized as an instant classic in the U.K. Wilson followed up with the Beach Boys' finest single, “Good Vibrations,” three-and-a-half thrilling minutes of electro-theremin and stacks of vocals, recorded over a period of six months in various studios at a cost that was reportedly, at that point, the most expensive single in history.


	Wilson returned to the studio with plans to top himself: an album called Smile, which he told friends would be a “teenage symphony to God.” Working with lyricist Van Dyke Parks, he started to assemble an elaborate collection of musical suites, intended to change the face of popular music, but the sessions fell apart, weighed down by the indifference of the other Beach Boys, Wilson's consumption of pot and LSD, and his growing mental instability. While recording “Mrs. O'Leary's Cow,” a piece of the “Elements” suite about fire, Wilson handed out plastic firemen's helmets to the orchestra and actually lit a fire in the studio to inspire them. When he found out that a building near the studio had burned down, he thought he had caused the fire through his music, freaked out, and locked the tapes in a vault.


	Wilson spent most of the next decade in his Bel Air mansion, which included both a recording studio and a sandbox in the living room (he put his piano in it so he could feel sand between his toes when he played). “He was a man so lonely and so abused and maligned, ostracized,” Van Dyke Parks told Rolling Stone in 2004. “It was an outrage what he suffered.”


	The Beach Boys continued without Brian Wilson; even as their album sales evaporated, they remained a popular oldies-oriented touring act. Over the following decades, Wilson would periodically rejoin the band and sometimes even tour with them, despite the intra-band lawsuits over songwriting credits and money. In 1988, Wilson hesitantly stepped back into the public eye and started releasing solo albums, beginning with the cult masterpiece Brian Wilson, which had a executive producer credit for Wilson's longtime therapist, Dr. Eugene Landy (who later had lost his license to practice therapy). It was outpaced commercially by Wilson's daughters, Carnie and Wendy, who formed two-thirds of Wilson Phillips, a vocal trio that sold ten million copies of their 1990 debut album. Wilson performed with his daughters on 1995's I Just Wasn't Made for These Times. That same year he released Orange Crate Art, an collaboration with Van Dyke Parks.

	











Smile‘s legend had only increased in the decades since it was abandoned; it was considered the great lost rock album and even inspired a time-travel novel (Lewis Shiner's Glimpses) where the protagonist convinces Wilson to complete the album. Although songs, including “Heroes and Villains” and “Surf's Up,” had made their way piecemeal onto Beach Boys albums, it was generally assumed that it was impossible to piece together the shards of Wilson's masterpiece. In 2004, however, against all odds, Wilson completed the album; in a five-star review, Rolling Stone said it was “beautiful and funny, goofily grand.”


	Wilson had found his way to something that once seemed impossible: a happy ending. “I'll tell you something I've learned,” he confided to Rolling Stone in 2004. “It's hard work to be happy.”

	In February 2024, just weeks after the death of Brian's second wife and longtime manager, Melinda, Brian's family revealed that the singer was suffering from dementia, and a conservatorship was sought to secure his continued care.


	“This decision was made to ensure that there will be no extreme changes to the household, and Brian and the children living at home will be taken care of and remain in the home where they are cared for,” the Wilson family statement said at the time. “Brian will be able to enjoy all of his family and friends and continue to work on current projects as well as participate in any activities he chooses.”

"Piracy is piracy," says Disney's chief legal officer, as the studios aim to show that tools allowing personalized AI slop creations of characters like Darth Vader or Shrek run afoul of their IP. 


							By 

	Erik Hayden


Executive Editor, Business


	In the next chapter of Big Entertainment vs. Big Tech, Disney and Universal have filed a lawsuit against artificial intelligence company Midjourney over tools that allow users to create images and videos that can manipulate famous characters at the click of a prompt.


	The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday by Disney Enterprises, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century, Universal City Studios Productions and DreamWorks Animation, describes the David Holz-run generative AI firm Midjourney as a “bottomless pit of plagiarism.”

	The legal salvo marks the first major foray from Hollywood against tech giants that are hoping to reorient consumer habits with personalized entertainment and information by vacuuming up data on the internet and spitting it out in the form of chatbot copy or images. So far, Wall Street has bet big that AI will be a major economic driver in the future and AI companies have raised tens of billions of dollars to realize that vision.


	Notably, major film and TV studios have not yet inked significant deals with AI companies to license their IP to these tech giants' tools that are now used by millions of users. That marks a different tack from major media companies, which have largely decided to take checks to license content to companies like OpenAI versus spend millions fighting in court. (The New York Times is an exception, and it has spent $10 million-plus fighting OpenAI so far.) 


	The complaint from Disney and Universal details how Midjourney's tools easily allow users to create image-based works based on the intellectual property of Disney and Universal — think: Darth Vader or Shrek at the beach, etc. This is commonly called “AI Slop,” and many likely already see it in their social media feeds. 

	











	“If a Midjourney subscriber submits a simple text prompt requesting an image of the character Darth Vader in a particular setting or doing a particular action, Midjourney obliges by generating and displaying a high quality, downloadable image featuring Disney's copyrighted Darth Vader character,” the complaint reads. 


	The complaint offers AI-generated images of Vader, Wall-E, Stormtroopers, How to Train Your Dragon characters, Minions and Shrek and many more as evidence of copyright infringement perpetuated by Midjourney. And it singles out Star Wars character Yoda with a side-by-side comparison: 


	The Hollywood studios go on to allege that Midjourney is able to provide such outputs because its tools have already ingested copyrighted intellectual property across the web as training data. “Midjourney downloaded from the internet, and other sources, content using tools variously described as bots, scrapers, streamrippers, video downloaders, and web crawlers,” the complaint says, alleging that the AI company's CEO David Holz “admitted that to collect the training data, Midjourney ‘pulls off all the data it can, all the text it can, all the images it can.'”


	The studios also claim that Midjourney then “cleaned” and converted digital files of copyrighted intellectual property to use in its training data so that its tools could then provide outputs allowing users to create things like personalized Yoda, Vader or Shrek images. “When a subscriber enters a prompt for an image of Spider-Man, Minions, Iron Man, or any of Plaintiffs' countless copyrighted characters, Midjourney creates yet another copy of that character which it publicly displays and/or distributes via download,” the complaint reads. 

	











	The lawsuit highlights that not only does Midjourney allow the creation of these works based on Disney and Universal's copyrighted characters, the AI company goes further by having them displayed in its “Explore” section of its website — a sign that, the studios say, Midjourney is fully aware of what its product does and is capitalizing on the plagiarism. 


	“Midjourney's publication and curation of infringing images on the Explore page show that Midjourney knows that its platform regularly reproduces Plaintiffs' Copyrighted Works, and that the Explore page is intended to advertise Midjourney's ability to infringe the Copyrighted Works,” the complaint reads.


	And the complaint goes on to alleged that Midjourney has the tools in place to prevent outputs that run afoul of copyrighted intellectual property, but it choose to not enact them. “Midjourney controls, and has the ability to control, generative outputs through readily available technical protection measures,” the studios argue. “Despite having the ability to do so, Midjourney has affirmatively chosen not to use copyright protection measures to limit the infringement.”


	The top legal officer of Disney put it more simply in a strongly-worded statement accompanying the lawsuit: “Piracy is piracy.” Using that phrasing frames the fight against Midjourney in familiar language to the studios' lobbying group, the Motion Picture Association, which also talks up its fight against piracy. But the MPA, so far, has mostly gone after websites that show unauthorized movies and TV shows, not AI companies, despite the prevalence of users flocking to AI-powered tools. 

	











	“Our world-class IP is built on decades of financial investment, creativity and innovation—investments only made possible by the incentives embodied in copyright law that give creators the exclusive right to profit from their works,” stated Disney general counsel Horacio Gutierrez. “We are bullish on the promise of AI technology and optimistic about how it can be used responsibly as a tool to further human creativity. But piracy is piracy, and the fact that it's done by an AI company does not make it any less infringing.”

The news comes on the heels of the project's lead single, "Manchild."


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Sabrina Carpenter‘s break between her last album and next LP was short and sweet, with the pop star announcing Wednesday (June 11) that she has another full-length titled Man's Best Friend coming out this summer.


	Sharing the news on Instagram, Carpenter unveiled the project's sensual cover art — a photo of the Grammy winner down on her knees in black stilettos, held in place by a man gripping a fistful of her hair — and revealed that it will arrive Aug. 29. “i can't wait for it to be yours x,” she added in her caption.

	











	According to its Spotify countdown page, Man's Best Friend will feature 12 tracks, including lead single “Manchild,” which recently dropped and is gunning for a high debut on the Billboard Hot 100. The country-tinged track — co-written and produced alongside Carpenter's Short n' Sweet collaborators Jack Antonoff and Amy Allen — finds the Girl Meets World alum playfully calling out incompetent men.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Manchild, why you always come a-running to me?/ F–k my life, won't you let an innocent woman be?” she sings on the song. “Never heard of self-care/ Half your brain just ain't there.”


Man's Best Friend comes close on the heels of Carpenter's breakthrough album Short n' Sweet, which dropped last August and propelled the singer to superstar status through Billboard Hot 100 top 10 singles “Espresso” and “Taste.” The LP marked her first-ever No. 1 entry on the Billboard 200, where it reigned at the top for four weeks, and spawned her first Hot 100 No. 1, “Please Please Please.”

EXCLUSIVE: Jessica Frances Dukes (Ozark, The Gilded Age) has been set as a series regular in MGM+ series The Westies, the upcoming period crime drama series from Chris Brancato, co-creator, executive producer, and showrunner.


	Co-created by Brancato and Michael Panes, The Westies is set in the early 1980s when the construction of the Jacob Javitz Convention Center on the Westies' home turf in Hell's Kitchen promises a financial windfall for the Irish-American organized crime gang. Despite being outnumbered 50-to-1 by the Five Families of the Italian mafia, The Westies' legendary brutality and cunning have given them the leverage necessary to share the spoils through a fragile détente. However, internal conflict between the brash younger generation and the old-school leadership threatens to set a match to this powder keg, which will sweep the Westies into the FBI's ever-deepening investigation into the Italian mafia.

Netflix is turning to a French icon for its latest feature film.


	The streaming service has greenlit a retelling of the life of Quasimodo, the man said to have inspired Victor Hugo's bell-ringer in The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. 


Vincent Cassel (La Haine) has been cast in the titular role. Jean-Francois Richet (Plane) is set to direct a script penned by Eric Besnard (Wrath of Man). Mediawan's Radar Films is housing the feature, with Clément Miserez and Matthieu Warter producing. 


	Here's the Quasimodo logline: “Set in Paris on the eve of the July Revolution (1830), this film reimagines the life of the man said to have inspired Victor Hugo's iconic character, Quasimodo. As the cholera epidemic spreads through the city, he's caught between political turmoil and an impossible love.”

	











	Cassel, who is no stranger to starring in screen adaptations of French classics after appearing in Asterix & Obelix: The Middle Kingdom, will embody a character that has a long association with the big screen. Quasimodo was depicted by Anthony Hopkins in 1982's The Hunchback of Notre Dame, while Tom Hulce voiced the role in Disney's 1996 animation.

	Netflix will get cameras rolling on Quasimodo this summer in France.

It is the end of an era for one former “Real Housewives of Atlanta” couple. Kim Zolciak and Kroy Biermann have finally exited the Georgia mansion that was the backdrop for numerous fights and police calls.

According to Page Six, the US Marshals intervened and removed them from the home on April 8, 2025. As per a court filing, four deputy marshals “ejected” Zolciak and Biermann from the Atlanta mansion from 3:30 p.m. to 6:45 p.m.

The former reality star and the ex-NFL player finally sold their mansion in February 2025 for $2.75 million — $3 million less than the original asking price — after it was on the market for a year and a half.

The 15,000-square-foot home is a luxurious property with a heated pool, five fireplaces, a six-car garage, an elevator, an arcade room, a movie theater, a gym, and more.

The new owners of the Atlanta estate began the process of legally removing the former couple from the home last December, according to new court documents obtained by Page Six. In the filing, the new owners claimed that Zolcial and Biermann held “the premises over and beyond the term for which they rented to them.”

They also claimed that the estranged couple had already been served the papers for the “proceeding against a tenant holding over.” Those filings from the owners went unanswered.

According to Page Six, Kroy Biermann filed for divorce from Kim in the summer of 2023, and now that the issues with their Georgia mansion have been resolved, the exes are finally able to focus on what they hope is a positive future. 

Kim has relocated to a rental property with their four minor children: Kroy Jr. (also known as KJ), 14, Kash, 12, and 11-year-old twins Kaia and Kane. They also share daughters Brielle, 28, and Ariana, 23, whom Biermann adopted back in 2012. It might be the perfect time for her to return to television, with a camera following her as she rebuilds her now-single life. 

According to Ariana Biermann, Kroy has stepped away from the drama and is living a quiet life by himself. The ex-reality star has also undergone a serious career change. He now oversees logistics and helps with improving workplace efficiency at Superior Rigging and Erecting Co.

The lower-security prisoners in Charles Williams' difficult but deeply penetrating “Inside” sometimes pass the time by playing the trivia games that are printed on the packaging of their sweets. “WHO AM I?” the text asks, before offering a series of clues about, say, a Brooklyn-born musician who got his first break when Bette Midler hired him as a pianist. Most of the characters in this decidedly grounded Australian prison drama are too young — and too many worlds removed — to know who Barry Manilow is, let alone guess his identity based on a handful of factoids. But that doesn't stop these men from trying, even if they spend every day of their sentences trying to separate their souls from the bullet points of their own biographies. Are they more than what they've done? The people they've hurt? The situations they were born into?

We know they are. Not because they're human, and we have the natural grace to extend these murderers the courtesy of that recognition, but rather because this film wouldn't have any reason to exist if the answer to any of those questions was “no.” The abundant power of Williams' debut feature — which stems from his experience growing up in an economically dispossessed Victoria town whose jail was like a second home for several of the men in his family — is rooted in the fact that “Inside” never pretends otherwise. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






This is not a story that labors to earn its prisoners their humanity. On the contrary, it's a story about how their clear and inextinguishable humanity is liable to become a prison unto itself. In the borrowed words of long-time inmate Warren Murfett (a bushy and brilliant Guy Pearce): “The worst of men have a little bit of good in them, and that'll be their undoing.” 

Warren is quoting another inmate at the same time as he's mocking the way that some of his fellow convicts try to protect themselves with aphorisms, but some pearls of wisdom are worth carrying around in your pocket like a shiv at the ready. For a man with blood on his hands like Warren, it's that last mote of humanity that might prove to be his doom — the stubborn part of himself that still yearns for redemption, hopes for healing, and strives to make something more of himself before there's nothing left. 

It's the part of himself that 17-year-old Mel Blight (puppy-eyed newcomer Vincent Miller, wrenchingly credible in his first movie role) is already trying to stamp out by the time Williams' film begins to take shape around him. In his opening voiceover, which floats above the sort of glassy synth music that's meant to numb our judgment, Mel informs us that he was conceived during a conjugal visit when his father was in prison, and that his dad once told him that he was destined to wind up back behind bars. “And he was right.” A broken home gave way to juvenile detention, and the violence that followed him there saw Mel transferred to general population — not unheard of in a country where kids as young as 10 can be locked away indefinitely. 

 










Now that he's inching toward parole, Mel's doing everything in his power to fuck it up. “They want me to make a story out of it and pretend I've changed,” he says when asked to write a letter of contrition to the boy he beat to death in juvie. “But I haven't changed. No one does, especially inside.” By “inside” he means prison, but Williams' delicate script obviously intends for us to recognize that he means inside himself as well. 

If this film is able to afford such an explicit double entendre, that's because of how truthfully it grapples with the nuances of rehabilitation — with the crooked path these men are meant to walk from sin to salvation, and with the practical realities of returning to a world that may no longer have a place for them in it. Like so many of the people he meets in prison, Mel doesn't think he's worthy of being released. “There's something broken inside of us,” he writes in one of his letters, and it's easier for him to own that spiritual dysfunction than to risk the heartache of failing to overcome it. 

That's a big part of the initial reason why Warren takes Mel under his wing: The kid is the perfect candidate to kill the most hated man in prison, whose bounty would be enough to pay off Warren's dire gambling debt. The target's name is Mark Shepard (a slack-jawed Cosmo Jarvis, who continues to be one of the most gifted chameleons in modern cinema), he became a national sensation when he was convicted for the rape and murder of a young girl when he was only 13 years old himself, and — after earning a transfer out of maximum security — he happens to be Mel's new cellmate. 

 










What separates Mark from the other two characters in this movie's core triangle is that he's evangelically convinced of his own absolution, to the point that he delivers Pentecostal sermons to the world's most hostile congregation. He even ropes Mel into playing the prayer room keyboard as he preaches. It's a little detail, but also one emblematic of the irreconcilable tension that “Inside” would rather articulate than resolve; Williams often lingers on the image of Mel sitting focused at the piano, forcing us to guess whether the kid is starting to entertain the possibility of self-deliverance, or whether he's plotting how to stab the man at the pulpit. Of course, Mel's dilemma isn't so black-and-white, especially because offing a “monster” of Mark's caliber might be the shortest possible route to getting right with God. 

“Inside” eventually builds to a clear moment of choice for the sake of its own climax, but the vast majority of this movie is spent complicating its characters' logic rather than framing their choices as some moral binary. Not only do Williams and Jarvis conspire to rescue a mottled innocence from the recesses of Mark's tortured mind (a process that hinges on a truly shocking reveal), but Pearce's layered and wrenchingly humane performance eventually reveals Warren to be the heart of the film.

 










That isn't because Warren evolves from the diabolical manipulator that he seems to be at the start of this story, but rather because we bear witness to how the character reframes himself as his greatest mark. He might tell Mel that breaking their cycles of violence is as foolish as thinking a different song might come on when you replay a tape, but some of his actions suggest otherwise, and the surrogate father role Warren assumes while coaching Mel towards another murder starts to affect the older man after he suffers a disastrous visit with his actual son during a brief furlough (“Babyteeth” breakout Toby Wallace is outstanding in the crucial one-scene role). The Joker-like shot of Warren sticking his head out of a car window on the way back to jail, his beard blasting against his face in the wind, is an unforgettably poignant snapshot of a man who's free from everything but himself. 

“Inside” is a small and constrained prison drama, even by the inflexible standards of its genre, and yet Williams' debut is so replete with such moments of raw compassion that it almost invisibly accumulates a deep well of emotion — one that allows the film to feel much bigger than it looks by the time it arrives at its absolute knockout of a final scene. There are a few small cheats along the way, but “Inside” is averse to didacticism and neoliberal heart-softening when it counts, and the power it achieves in the end is inextricable from the honesty with which it's earned. “Who Am I?” is a mystery that none of these characters may ever be able to solve for themselves, at least not with the certainty of a trivia game on the back of a candy wrapper, but to watch them look for the answers in each other is enough to convince us that the question is always worth asking. 

 










“Inside” screened at the 2025 Tribeca Festival. Quiver Distribution will release it in theaters on Friday, June 20.

The Walt Disney Co. and NBCUniversal sued AI company Midjourney on Wednesday, alleging that its image-generating service “functions as a virtual vending machine” that generates “endless unauthorized copies” of copyrighted works.


	The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, is the first major legal action that studios have taken against an AI company. Axios first reported on the lawsuit.


	The lawsuit states, “By helping itself to Plaintiffs' copyrighted works, and then distributing images (and soon videos) that blatantly incorporate and copy Disney's and Universal's famous characters—without investing a penny in their creation—Midjourney is the quintessential copyright free-rider and a bottomless pit of plagiarism. Piracy is piracy, and whether an infringing image or video is made with AI or another technology does not make it any less infringing.”

	Disney and NBCU are seeking unspecified maximum statutory damages, an accounting of Midjourney's proceeds from the alleged infringement, and injunctive relief.

	As an example, the lawsuit states that if a Midjourney subscriber “submits a simple text prompt requesting an image of the character Darth Vader in a particular setting or doing a particular action, Midjourney obliges by generating and displaying a high quality, downloadable image featuring Disney's copyrighted Darth Vader character.” The same is true of NBCU's Minions character. The lawsuit features the images, as well as a number of other examples.


	Representatives for Midjourney did not immediately respond to request for comment.

	The lawsuit also delves into the use of copyrighted material to train AI models, a practice that is the source of fierce debate between major AI firms and content companies. The lawsuit noted that Midjourney has been teasing a new video service, “meaning that Midjourney is very likely already infringing Plaintiffs' copyrighted works.”

	











	As Congress has weighed new laws to regulate AI, the official position of the Motion Picture Association has been that existing copyright law is sufficient to address a new front in the piracy wars. The MPA has emphasized the need for flexibility, including leaving up to the court's to decide whether the use of copyrighted content in training models is a “fair use.” 


	The New York Times and book authors, among others, have sued AI companies over the use of copyrighted material. But the studios suggest that Midjourney's use of copyrighted works was more obvious.


	“This case is not a ‘close call' under well-settled copyright law,” the lawsuit states, adding that Midjourney “sells subscriptions to consumers so that they can view and download copies of Plaintiffs' valuable copyrighted characters. That is textbook copyright infringement.” 


	The studios claim that Midjourney could implement protection measures to prevent its image service from generating infringing images, but it has not done so. The studios said that before the legal action they asked Midjourney to take such action, but it instead has “continued to release new versions of its Image Service, which, according to Midjourney's founder and CEO, have even higher quality infringing images.”


	Horacio Gutierrez, senior executive vice president and chief legal and compliance officer for Disney, said in a statement, “Our world-class IP is built on decades of financial investment, creativity and innovation—investments only made possible by the incentives embodied in copyright law that give creators the exclusive right to profit from their works. We are bullish on the promise of AI technology and optimistic about how it can be used responsibly as a tool to further human creativity. But piracy is piracy, and the fact that it's done by an AI company does not make it any less infringing.” 


	Kim Harris, executive vice president and general counsel of NBCU, said, “Creativity is the cornerstone of our business.  We are bringing this action today to protect the hard work of all the artists whose work entertains and inspires us and the significant investment we make in our content.  Theft is theft regardless of the technology used, and this action involves blatant infringement of our copyrights.”


	The studios are represented by David Singer, Julie Shepard and Lauren Greene of Jenner & Block.

David Harbour is ready to pull up the anchor on “Stranger Things.” The actor, who plays Hopper in the beloved Netflix series, told Interview magazine that he is content that the show will end after five seasons and almost 10 years onscreen. 

“When I started, I loved it so much,” Harbour said. “Buddies of mine who'd done TV shows for many years said, ‘By Season 3 or 4 you'll be running.' And I was like, ‘Never! I love all these guys so much.' And then you get to a certain point where you're like, ‘How much more story is there?'” 

 










He continued, “You're having to play a lot of the same beat, and there's a feeling where you're like, ‘I want to take a risk. I want to do something that people haven't seen me do before.' So yeah, after 10 years, it's like, ‘OK.'”

“Stranger Things” Season 5, Vol. 1 will be released Wednesday, November 26, with Vol. 2 debuting on Christmas Day. The series finale will debut on New Year's Eve. 

 










Harbour previously said during the live “Happy Sad Confused” podcast at Comic Con, via People, that the series finale is the “best episode they've ever done,” adding, “They land the plane.” 

And according to the “Thunderbolts” star, the “Stranger Things” ensemble cast (which includes Millie Bobby Brown, Winona Ryder, Joe Keery, Sadie Sink, Finn Wolfhard, Joseph Quinn, and Maya Hawke) couldn't hold back their emotions during the table read for the last episode. “The end of this [final] episode when we were reading it — just us reading it — about halfway through, people started crying,” Harbour said. “Then about the last 20 minutes, it was just uncontrollably crying, waves of different people. Noah Schnapp being my favorite.” 

Harbour added to the Comic Con audience, “I think part of that also is the fact that these kids, it was their childhood. It's 10 years later, and we examine that idea, and it's so well done and so beautiful. It's such a great episode, and it's such a great season. You guys will love it.”

	Won't the real Pitbull please stand up? In recent months, fans of Mr. Worldwide have taken to donning bald caps, designer shades, and black suits — just like the 44-year-old rapper himself — while attending Pitbull concerts. Well, the Miami-born rapper has noticed the viral trend, especially on his U.K. and Ireland tour last week, and seeing the love makes him “very, very happy,” according to an interview he gave the BBC on Tuesday.


	“Every time I'm at a show, I let them know that when you put on a bald cap, I hope you're ready to have the time of your lives,” he said. “It feels deeper than just music.”


	People have cosplayed as their favorite artists in one form or another for more than half a century, getting moptop haircuts like the Beatles, sporting “Starchild” makeup at Kiss concerts, and wearing homemade masks to Slipknot shows. But few fan bases have gone the extra mile to put on bald caps, and Pitbull said he felt touched by seeing the special effort his fans put into their mimicry.

The label will focus on emerging talent from around the world.

	Katie Bain



The Coca Cola Company and Universal Music Group have partnered on the launch of a new imprint, Real Thing Records. or rtr.


	The venture will focus on signing and developing emerging talent from around the world, with the label focused on all genres. The first signees are French-New Zealand artist Max Allais, who clocked a hit this year with his single “When The Party Ends.”


	Real Thing Records. has also signed Indian singer, songwriter and producer, Aksomaniac, whose music fuses jazz, hip-hop and R&B with traditional Carnatic music. 


	Each new signing will be a joint effort between Real Thing Records. and a Universal Music Group label counterpart in each artist's respective territory, to provide both local support and global growth. For Allais these frontline labels will be Better Now Records and Universal Music Germany) and for  Aksomaniac they will be Def Jam Recordings India/Universal Music India. 


	 “The Coca-Cola Company has a rich legacy, one of deep human connection and cultural resonance—breaking barriers and bringing people together across borders and generations,” says Joshua Burke, The Coca-Cola Company's global head of music and culture.

	“Real Thing Records. is designed to unlock greater potential for artists, fans, and our brands—where creativity fuels growth and the combined power of our network and key global music partners create value greater than the sum of its parts,” Burke continues. “It's our intention to let artists shine and give them the flexibility to develop their identities with the support of global reach and expertise. It's a long-term commitment to music—enabling us to reinvest in our programs, champion the next generation of talent, and stay rooted in what matters most: music and fandom.” 


	This is not the first partnership between The Coca Cola Company and UMG, with UMG also previously serving as the label partner for Coke Studio, an initiative that has recruited superstar artists like Usher, Tyla, Karol G, Peggy Gou and NewJeans to participate in projects like original songs, festival experiences and live performances. 


	“For years, Universal Music Group and The Coca-Cola Company have shared a belief in the power of music to spark connection and shape meaningful experiences,” says Universal Music Group for Brands executive vice president Richard Yaffa. “With the launch of Real Thing Records., we are taking that vision further – joining forces to build a modern label that champions artistry and amplifies emerging voices on global and local stages, while giving fans the cultural moments they crave. 


	“Both companies recognize the long-term value of investing in artistic innovation,” Yaffa continues, “and our past work together has consistently demonstrated how music can move people and create lasting impact. The evolution and continued success of our several collaborations stands as a testament to what's possible when we align creativity with cultural relevance.”

“The Backrooms,” the viral YouTube horror series that has amassed nearly 200 million views since debuting in 2022, is officially becoming a feature film. A24 has greenlit a movie based on the property directed by 19-year-old series creator Kane Parsons, who will be the youngest director in A24 history when the film enters production this summer. 

Chiwetel Ejiofor and Renate Reinsve will star in “The Backrooms,” which is a co-production between A24 and Chernin Entertainment. James Wan and Shawn Levy will executive produce through their Atomic Monster and 21 Laps banners, respectively. Roberto Patino is also a producer. Chernin Entertainment, part of The North Road Company, will co-finance alongside A24.

While plot details for the film have been kept under wraps, the YouTube series used the found-footage format to gradually build a horror universe about liminal spaces that exist in our world without fully conforming to our reality. The slow builds and homemade special effects helped the eerie videos build a loyal following.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






A24's feature take on “The Backrooms,” which was first announced in 2023, has been cited as one of Hollywood's most significant investments in intellectual property that emerged from the internet. In Vol. 005 of the In Development newsletter from IndieWire's Future of Filmmaking, editor-in-chief Dana Harris-Bridson argued that Parsons represents the new archetype for indie film success in the 2020s.

“This sounds like a 21st-century riff on the Sundance wunderkind, but A24 didn't buy a short from a promising high school filmmaker. It bought an ecosystem,” she wrote of his success. “Scalable IP, with a built-in fanbase. Proof of engagement. Potential for merch, spin-offs, and platform-native storytelling. It's a lot less romantic than the ‘90s story, in which credit-card debt is burned away by a life-altering festival premiere that sends buyers huddling in the lobby to craft eight-figure offers. However, we can't believe in that folktale if we also believe in the internet. Thirty years ago, a rapturous reception was the only tool distributors had to project future results. In reality, the digital revolution in filmmaking happened at the same time as all the other digital revolutions. Today, no one relies on analog instinct for pretty much the same reason that you don't have a landline.”No release date for “The Backrooms” has been announced.

It sounds like a horror story: a lauded Hollywood icon readies their directorial debut with an entertaining and deeply personal fact-based film, casts a slew of big names (including themselves), shoots on an indie budget, takes it all the way to the Toronto International Film Festival for its world premiere, and then (then!) opts to recut the entire thing in hopes of securing a buyer in our increasingly fraught film landscape.

That's the story of Patricia Arquette's “Gonzo Girl,” but while other filmmakers might view the experience as a nightmare, the worst possible scenario, a kick against creative freedom, the Oscar winner has a different take on the whole thing: what a neat opportunity.

“I feel so grateful to the producers and for this opportunity to go back in and continue to learn about the filmmaking process and be able to re-edit this movie,” Arquette told IndieWire over Zoom. “It's been really fun and interesting, and so many people have helped in this process. It's exciting.”

 










For Arquette, the joy is doubled. As she sees it, she got to make both the “American version” and the “European cut” of her first film. Who else can say that?

When Arquette's film, based on Cheryl Della Pietra's memoir of the same name, premiered at TIFF 2023, this writer was enthusiastic about it, hailing its performances and high energy. Based on Della Pietra's own experiences working as Hunter S. Thompson's assistant (here, turned into “Walker Reade,” played by a perfectly cast Willem Dafoe), the film is mostly set on the writer's Colorado compound, and follows a young Della Pietra avatar as she falls into a truly gonzo way of living.

The “girl” of the film's title is Alley Russo, played by a luminous Camila Morrone. But after TIFF, Arquette and her team wondered if perhaps Alley's journey was not grounded enough within the framework of the film. Thus: recut. Now, almost two years later, the new version of the film is premiering at Tribeca Festival, where Arquette hopes to capture more eyeballs, attention, and maybe even a smart buyer.

“It's like the whole time that we were editing the movie, there was always this push to get into festivals, to prematurely be ready to try to apply to all these festivals,” Arquette said. “It's such a weird kind of a push, and it really is detrimental, I think, to the whole editing process.”

 










Still, Arquette has no knocks against that first cut, and she sees it in concert with the new version. “I actually really liked that cut of the movie,” she said. “I look at it more like the European cut. There's some more space in things, just to kind of absorb things. There's less handholding of the audience through where Alley is at from moment to moment. You have to be more engaged as an audience member of [the original cut], whereas this one is much more streamlined.” (The new version is about 11 minutes shorter than the one that played at TIFF.)

This new one? It's “the American version of that same movie,” as Arquette sees it. “We took a lot of this kind of space out of the movie and included some more stuff to follow through and clarify her journey and where she's coming from,” Arquette said. “This is a rite of passage of a young woman, and we don't really see so many of those. She's very idealistic when she starts this movie. Throughout the movie, she's exploring different aspects of her power, of her beauty, and she is subconsciously kind of agreeing to things that maybe she's not comfortable with. By the end, she has a strength where she can challenge things.”

Arquette also appears in the film (both versions!) as her own sort of Gonzo Girl, playing Claudia, Walker's long-suffering assistant, maid, chef, house manager, accountant, and much more. Asked how she made the choice to co-star, Arquette laughed. It wasn't really a choice, more of a “prerequisite” from her financiers. But while Arquette said she initially worried that her focus might be split between her two roles on the production, the whole thing proved to be pretty freeing.

 










“What was good about it, I really only gave myself a take or two and very little coverage, I felt like, ‘OK, I know what I'm going to do with this part, so I'm just going to do it really fast and I'll have all this extra time to devote to everyone else,'” she recalled. “There's a couple of scenes in the movie that I laugh at because I'd be wearing whatever, a T-shirt and jeans, and then the wardrobe lady would be like, ‘What are you going to wear in this next scene? You're in the next scene.' And she'd roll stuff in, and I'd be like, ‘Grab a schmatta and throw it over the top of my stuff.' ‘What about hair and makeup?' I'd be like, ‘Just grab me that headband and put it on.'”

That also spoke to her character. “Claudia is the opposite side [of Alley], almost like the Ghislaine Maxwell,” she said. “When you've traded yourself off totally, who cares what I look like? Who cares what my needs are? Who cares whatever? I'm the cleanup person. I'll be the bad guy. I'm going to fix this. I'll be the mommy. You can complain and whine to me, and I will clean up your draw-up and fix your NDAs and get your drugs and whatever it is, and have you sleep with other people, and it's OK. I wanted to show that side of it, too.”

Having Arquette, Dafoe, and rising star Morrone on deck is an enviable enough prospect for any first-time director, but the filmmaker was also eager to point out her stacked supporting cast. Turns out, she's good at this casting thing, too.

 










“That's another thing I feel really excited about. I had a very good eye,” she said with a laugh. “Since then, everyone's been working a lot. Zoë [Bleu Sidel], she's got two big movies coming out. Ray [Nicholson]'s been super busy, and oh, my God, Leila [George] and Elizabeth [Lail] are so busy, so it's just exciting.”

Arquette was also clear: This was not all the product of good instincts. In fact, when it came to casting Morrone in the lead role, Arquette said she had to push back against some of her own biases and see the performer in front of her.

“I had a really amazing compliment on the movie the other day from an incredible actor, and they were like, ‘Oh, my God. She won me over times a thousand,'” she said. “Honestly, she won me over in the audition. I'm embarrassed to say this, but I almost didn't hire her because I thought, ‘Oh, my God, is she too pretty? Is she too pretty, and is it too distracting?' And then I thought, ‘Wait a minute, this is not cool. What am I saying? You were given too much when you were born? You're too pretty? Stay in the pretty box over there. You're not allowed to have these other talents. You're not allowed to explore these other things.' I did have to challenge myself and my own subconscious bias about beauty and about all of that.”

 










The result speaks for itself. “She is amazing in it, and she was so committed to it, and I think she really also understood this,” Arquette said. “It was this moment in her life where she was very vulnerable; she just had her heart broken and really put it all on screen.”

And, like Arquette, Morrone embraced the constraints of indie filmmaking with gusto. “No one with a prissy attitude could have survived that,” the filmmaker said. “‘Can you go change in the closet over there? We have 10 minutes. We don't have a dressing room. We have that little area that's got flies in it. Do you mind? Is it OK?' Nothing was easy.”

That sentiment seems to extend even to today. After screening at TIFF to mostly positive (if mixed) reviews, the film didn't find a buyer. With its Tribeca premiere this week, Arquette hopes to change that.

“I do think it's definitely a reset because I think it's a pretty significant recut of the movie,” she said. “The way that the movie feels is much more polished now and finished and kind of moves faster, and it leaves the audience with a bit of a different feeling. I think, honestly, every year or every six months, there's a reset at all these companies. What is their agenda? Who's working where? What are people's appetites? How adventurous they want to be? It's always an ever-changing industry, and I feel like we're in a big change right now.”

 










One of those changes that Arquette is not squeamish about: the possibility that “Gonzo Girl” might go to a streamer, not the usual theatrical release route. 

“Streamers are making so much of the movies and the content right now, you just can't have a realistic conversation without having them in the mix,” she said. “They are picking up a lot of content, and they are getting millions of eyes all over the world to see things. It was a lifesaver during COVID, and yes, we could argue that it's also been to the detriment of in-person theaters, but I do think that there has already been a bit of a resurgence, and I think that that will continue with theaters. I think that, with streamers, there will be a hybrid where they will have things come out in theaters for a certain period of time, and they'll go to their streamer.”

Arquette's longtime friend, collaborator, and “Boyhood” filmmaker Richard Linklater is no stranger to streamers, I noted, with both his “Hit Man” and his recent Cannes pick “Nouvelle Vague” heading to Netflix. Some people might gnash their teeth or beat their fists over that, but Arquette is pragmatic.

“‘Nouvelle Vague' was always going to go to a streamer eventually,” she said. “You need people to buy these things, and you want people to support them, and you want people to also be able to afford an awards campaign with a movie like that if you are worthy, if the performances are worthy, so yeah, we've got to be realistic.”

 










All that said, where is the perfect home for “Gonzo Girl,” American cut and all? 

“I'm hoping that it's somebody who has some nerve, somebody who's bold, somebody who understands, who loved movies like ‘Hurlyburly' and movies like that, and understand that there's some value in that,” Arquette said. “I hope that we end up with a distributor who gets it, who sees how beautiful the performances are and special and celebrates those and understands and wants to get into the weeds about all the different conversations [in this film].”

As for future filmmaking endeavors, Arquette is focused on a) getting this baby out in the world and b) her many acting gigs (she was gearing up for another day on the set of Hulu's upcoming Murdaugh murders series when we spoke, in the midst of Emmy campaigning for “Severance”). Still, it sounds like she's got the directing bug.

“I still kind of feel like, until I get [‘Gonzo Girl'] out and distributed and I support it, I don't really have room on my dance card to think of something else, but little weird, obscure thoughts do come to me,” she said.

Arquette also finds the time to enthusiastically and frequently support all sorts of organizations (from her safe sanitation-focused organization GiveLove to breast cancer awareness), and is often posting on her social channels about causes ranging from abortion access and election rights to Gaza and anti-fascism (her Instagram bio: “actress. activist. troublemaker”). How, I wondered, does she stay positive and creative — about the current state of the world, about recutting her passion project, about just existing? — given everything else going on.  

 










“I just feel like I'm one of millions and millions of people watching this, shocked by this, trying to adjust, scared for their kids, trying to make a plan, scrambling around watching the collapse of multiple industries and the readjustment of things,” Arquette said. “I try not to get too deep into my fear, because the maternal part of me wants to take care of everybody, and the maternal part of me is scared for everybody. I have to say thank God I'm in the creative work, because it does give me a respite.”

She added, “I also love beauty. I love not just the art of movie-making, but I love the art of design, decor, textiles, things women have made in different cultures, like the food that people make in different cultures and communities. Sometimes, I just have to step back and appreciate some beautiful woman I'm watching make a tortilla, like, ‘OK, we have been human for a long time. We have gotten through these crazy things many times, many strange kinds of things.' I try to just have faith in the goodness of mankind.”

“Gonzo Girl” will next screen at the 2025 Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Nancy Wilson‘s custom-made guitar, one of the two “irreplaceable” instruments that were stolen on the eve of Heart's tour, has been recovered, Atlantic City police announced Tuesday.


	A suspect in the theft was arrested last week, at which time authorities said they obtained surveillance footage of 57-year-old Garfield Bennett from Pleasantville, NJ, trying to sell various items he had allegedly stolen from the band on the eve of their Royal Flush summer tour on May 31.


	According to police, Bennett sold the purple Telecaster guitar made specifically for Wilson to another woman, who purchased it at a meet-up just blocks from the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino where the instruments were stolen, the Associated Press reports.


	Using automated license plate readers on the surveillance footage, police were able to identify the woman who purchased the guitar from Bennett; when contacted by police, she voluntarily returned the instrument.

	Wilson and Heart have not yet commented on the guitar's return. The band continues their Royal Flush tour Friday night in St. Louis, Missouri. Police added that the other stolen instrument, a vintage 1966 Gibson EM-50 mandolin played by band member Paul Moak for the past three decades, remains unaccounted for.

	“These instruments are more than just tools of our trade — they're extensions of our musical souls,” Nancy Wilson previously said in a statement after the instruments were first stolen. 


	“The baritone Tele was made uniquely for me, and Paul's mandolin has been with him for decades. We're heartbroken, and we're asking for their safe return—no questions asked. Their value to us is immeasurable.” She added, “We are deeply grateful to the Atlantic City Police Department, the Hard Rock organization, and everyone who came together to support us in the search for our stolen instruments. The outpouring of love and concern has been overwhelming, and we are truly touched by the strength and compassion of this community.”

	Even before Donald Trump militarized his crackdown on pro-immigrant protesters in Los Angeles, a massive, nationwide demonstration was in the works for Saturday.


	The “No Kings” protests on June 14 have been imagined as a peaceful uprising to counter President Trump throwing himself a military parade on his birthday (which is also Flag Day and the 250th anniversary of the Army). Trump is organizing spectacle befitting a tin-pot tyrant, including a procession of tanks, Howitzers, mobile rocket launchers and other war machines rolling through the streets of Washington, D.C., as military aircraft, including Apache helicopters, soar overhead. 


Protest organizers have billed June 14 as a “nationwide day of defiance,” during which Americans across the country stand up to “reject authoritarianism” and reclaim patriotism in the name of democracy. “The flag doesn't belong to President Trump. It belongs to us,” the protest website declares. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Trump has menaced demonstrators planning to show up at his military procession: “If any protester wants to come out, they will be met with very big force,” he said Tuesday. Anticipating such a reaction, protest organizers specifically decided not to target the Trump parade route; there is not even a No Kings event planned in D.C. They envision, instead, demonstrators “showing up everywhere [Trump] isn't — to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.”

	











	Turnout at the nationwide demonstrations is expected to surpass the April 5 “Hands Off!” protests, which drew more than 3 million protesters to oppose the Trump government, then dominated by Elon Musk, who was imposing draconian cuts on federal services through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. 

	











	“We've been planning the No Kings day” for months, says Ezra Levin, a cofounder of the progressive grassroots giant Indivisible, which is a key partner in a protest coalition that includes grassroots groups like 50501, civil rights organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, and many labor and environmental groups. Outside of a few anchor events — a large event is planned in Philadelphia, for example — the No Kings protests are organized on a viral, distributed basis, with locals in each community calling the shots. By last week, the number of planned events had already surpassed the April total.

	Now that Trump has ordered troops into the streets of Los Angeles — to crack down on Americans exercising their First Amendment rights by protesting actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement — the reasons to demonstrate just got a lot more concrete. With the “egregious overreach” in Los Angeles “inflaming tensions,” Levin says, “suddenly all the numbers started skyrocketing.”


	The volatile situation in the Los Angeles area was provoked by ICE agents expanding arrests of community members at job sites, including at downtown garment factories and a Home Depot. Tensions were also inflamed by reports of ICE taking law-abiding individuals who showed up to mandatory check-ins with immigration officials into custody, and then locking them in the basement of a federal building.Speaking Monday with Rolling Stone, Levin described 1,800 planned No Kings events, roughly 500 more than the total for April. These include protests across America — from Nome, Alaska, to San Juan, Puerto Rico (map: here) — as well as solidarity actions around the globe. “I can guarantee you there will be millions of people out on No Kings day,” he says.


	The planning for the No Kings protest began when Trump started touting his “dictator-style birthday parade,” Levin recalls. “We didn't want to cede the narrative to him; we didn't want to allow him to portray himself as all-powerful.” The idea was to mass mobilize Americans of all walks of life — in big cities and small towns and rural communities — as a counter weight to Trump's authoritarian ambitions. (Trump's birthday bash is wildly unpopular; a new poll finds the military parade is opposed by three out of four Americans, including a majority of Republicans.)

	The federal escalation in Southern California is rocket fuel for the protest mission. “In the context of his escalation in L.A., it takes on greater import,” Levin says. “You need to have a visible demonstration that Americans are against authoritarian overreach.”


	Organizers want to turn out protesters who are ideologically diverse and geographically dispersed. “It needs to be everywhere, so that the contrast of what Trump is doing is as clear as possible,” says Levin, a former congressional staffer. “This guy stands for himself and his cronies. And the American people aren't going to stand for it.”

	











	The L.A. protests have been combustible, marked by clashes between demonstrators and the city's notoriously brutal cops and sheriff deputies, as well as with paramilitary forces from the Department of Homeland Security. The authorities have been launching tear-gas attacks and firing less-lethal projectiles into crowds, and agitators have been filmed throwing rocks and debris at law enforcement.


	Levin insists that No Kings will be a show of nonviolent resistance, adding that Trump's ugly show of force — including deploying National Guard troops and Marines in Los Angeles over the governor's objections — must be met with a combination of mass turnout and immaculate vibes. “When they crack down on peaceful protests, what you need is overwhelmingly large, peaceful protests. That's the way you respond to the authoritarian playbook.


	“We need nonviolence in the streets,” he continues. “The alternative is giving the authoritarian the excuse that he wants to crack down on yet more peaceful protesters outside of L.A.”

	With emotions running hot, that puts a special burden on protest organizers — most of whom are self-appointed volunteers. No Kings organizers are providing trainings this week for local protest marshals — emphasizing public safety and de-escalation. “We need to have everybody in the right mindset,” Levin says, explaining that the protests are a “strategic play to demonstrate exactly how outside the norm this administration is.” 


	Events this large can take on a life of their own. “Some people are going to join in because they heard it was the cool place to be,” Levin says. “It's incumbent on those who are more engaged to act as leaders and to operate under the umbrella of nonviolence, because the alternative is playing directly into Trump's hands.”

In a career that lasted more than 60 years, he appeared in films with Burt Lancaster and Ted Cassidy. And in a commercial for cough syrup, he noted he wasn't a doctor but played one on TV.


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	Chris Robinson, who starred as a World War II bomber pilot on the 1960s ABC drama 12 O'Clock High and had lengthy stints on the daytime soap operas General Hospital and The Bold and the Beautiful, has died. He was 86.


	Robinson died Monday on his ranch near Sedona, Arizona, actor and musician MJ Allen announced on Facebook. They worked together on the 2022 film Just for a Week.




	During an acting career that spanned eight decades, Robinson worked alongside Burt Lancaster in The Young Savages (1961) and Birdman of Alcatraz (1962), both directed by John Frankenheimer, and with Addams Family icon Ted Cassidy in four films, all of which he directed.

	The Florida native also starred as Vietnam vet Tim Ochopee, a Seminole with a pet rattlesnake who obeys his commands (for most of the movie, anyway), in the Everglades-set horror film Stanley (1972), from Crown International Pictures.


	Robinson joined the cast of the Quinn Martin-produced 12 O'Clock High as Technical Sgt. Sandy Komansky for its second season in September 1965. (Also coming on board as a full-time castmember that year: Paul Burke as Col. Joe Gallagher.) He appeared on the final 46 episodes of the show through January 1967.


	On ABC's General Hospital, he portrayed Dr. Rick Webber (two-time husband of Denise Alexander‘s Lesley and adoptive father of Genie Francis' Laura) from 1978-86. He came back in 2002, only to have his character bludgeoned to death with a candlestick by Scotty Baldwin (Kin Shriner), Laura's former husband.


	Robinson also played Jack Hamilton, who enjoyed romances with Stephanie Douglas (Susan Flannery) and her rival Sally Spectra (Darlene Conley), on CBS' The Bold and the Beautiful from 1992-2002, with a final appearance in 2005.


	While he was working on G.H. — and after showing up in Garry Marshall's soapy Young Doctors in Love (1982) — Robinson established his bona fides as a pitchman in a Vicks Formula 44 cough syrup commercial. “I'm not a doctor,” he noted, “but I do play one on TV.”

	











	But when he encountered legal trouble related to income tax evasion, he was replaced by Peter Bergman, another TV doctor on another soap (All My Children).


	Born on Nov. 5, 1938, in West Palm Beach, Florida, Christopher Brown Robinson appeared uncredited in the Tony Curtis-starring The Midnight Story (1957). Two years later, he played a teenage thug in The Diary of a High School Bride and the spider-like monster in Gene Corman's Beast From Haunted Cave, wearing a costume he had designed.


	Robinson stayed busy after that, guest-starring on such series as Colt. 45, Hennesey, The Donna Reed Show, Sea Hunt, Death Valley Days, Ben Casey, Gunsmoke, Wagon Train and The Fugitive before landing on 12 O'Clock High.


	He starred as an albino slave who is on the run with his brother (Anthony Scott) from a plantation owner (Cassidy) in Catch the Black Sunshine (1974), which he also wrote and directed, then did similar triple duty on Thunder County (1974), The Intruder (1975) and The Great Balloon Race (1977).


	Talking about The Intruder — which also featured Mickey Rooney and Yvonne De Carlo — in a 2017 interview with Nick Thomas, Robinson said he cast it, put the crew together and shot it in a mere six weeks.


	Asked what became of the movie, Robinson replied: “I have no idea. I wasn't involved in the editing and didn't even see the finished film, which was never released. I moved on to other projects and just forgot about it.”

	











	Robinson's big-screen résumé also included Because They're Young (1960), The Long Rope (1961), Shootout at Big Sag (1962), Lady in Cement (1968), The Cycle Savages (1969), The Hawaiians (1970), Revenge Is My Destiny (1971), Amy (1981), Savannah Smiles (1982) and Just for a Week (2022).


	Click here for a video tribute to his career.


	In 1985, Robinson pleaded guilty to federal income tax evasion but was allowed to continue on G.H. by serving his sentence on nights and weekends. In between that soap and The Bold and the Beautiful, he portrayed Jason Frame on NBC's Another World from 1987-89.


	He married his fourth wife, Jacquie, in April 2011. Survivors also include his children, Shane, Coby, Christian, Christopher, Chris and Taylor, and grandchildren Ivy, Ava, Davey, Brooks and Knox.


	His son Chris opened a window into the family by producing and directing two documentary shorts: Bankrupt by Beanies (2009), about his dad buying many thousands of Beanie Baby plush toys with the goal of reselling them at a profit, and Bastard: An Illegitimate Film (2010), which explored his “complicated” family tree (his father had his nine kids with six women).


	Chris revealed in Bastard that he was “conceived in [his dad's] dressing room in General Hospital” and pointed out that his father “practically had as many relationships in his real life as he's had in the movies.”


	“No matter how we came to be, all of us are connected,” Chris, talking about his siblings and half-siblings, said in closing the documentary. “And when our father is gone, even as some of us don't even consider him to be their father, we'll still have each other to look to for love and support. It might not be normal, but it's certainly a hell of a lot more interesting.”

Senior International Film Correspondent


EXCLUSIVE: Gkids has acquired multiple territories for Japanese animated action sci-fi drama All You Need Is Kill, including for North America, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.


	The movie is based on the eponymous best-selling novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka which also inspired Doug Liman's 2014 live-action adaptation Edge of Tomorrow with Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt.


	The directorial debut of Kenichiro Akimoto, with a script written by Yuichiro Kido, the new animated adaptation world premiered at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival earlier this week in the Midnight Specials section.

All You Need Is Kill is produced by Warner Bros. Japan with animation production by celebrated Japanese animation house Studio 4°C (Tekkonkinkreet, Mind Game). 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Studio 4°C, which is also at Annecy this year with Yasuhiro Aoki's drama ChaO in the main competition,  will be hosting a studio presentation at the festival on Friday, in the presence of the directors and producers for both titles. 


	Set in the near future, All You Need Is Kill follows the story of Rita, a resourceful but isolated young woman volunteering to help rebuild Japan after the mysterious appearance of a massive alien flower known as “Darol.”


	When Darol unexpectedly erupts in a deadly event, unleashing monstrous creatures that decimate the population, Rita is caught in the destruction—and killed. But then she wakes up again. And again. 


	Caught in an endless time loop, Rita must navigate the trauma and repetition of death until she crosses paths with Keiji, a shy young man trapped in the same cycle. Together, they fight to break free from the loop and find meaning in the chaos around them.

	











	“With All You Need Is Kill, I wanted to convey that even in the endless loop of life, we can still make discoveries and grow, depending on how we perceive the situation,” said Akimoto.


	“All You Need Is Kill is a standout work that explores time, identity, and survival with breathtaking animation and a powerful emotional core,” said Gkids President Dave Jesteadt. “The story has remained so meaningful for years because it captures something essential about the human condition, and the need to keep moving forward. Director Akimoto has created a brilliant new take that we are sure fans will love.”


	Gkids and Studio 4°C have previously collaborated on releases for Mind Game, Children of the Sea, while Gkids also recently acquired ChaO, and several other celebrated titles. 


	Further details on the release will be announced at a later date.


	The deal was negotiated between GKIDS' Director of Acquisitions and Development Rodney Uhler, and Warner Bros. Japan.

	The team behind Warners' upcoming The Cat in the Hat movie have defended the studio's decision to shelve Coyote vs. Acme, saying that the episode should not “become representative of how painful and atrocious the industry can be.” 


	Speaking during a Work in Progression session at Annecy, Alessandro Carloni, who is co-writing and directing The Cat in the Hat, said he has landed six movie directing roles across his career and only finished two of them. 


	“It's that kind of industry,” he added. “You have to go with the frustration. We are lucky to do art in our profession but we can't lock ourselves in a basement and paint a painting. We get to do things that are huge and expensive and it is a business.”

	Carloni was responding to a question about the shelving of Coyote vs. Acme, which took place in late 2023 leading to an estimated $30M write-down on the $70M production for the David Zaslav-led conglom.

	While “some of us are unlucky to have lost projects,” Carloni warned against “one specific case” becoming “representative of how painful and atrocious the industry can be.”


	Erica Rivinoja, who co-wrote and directed The Cat in the Hat with Carloni, pointed out that Coyote vs. Acme will in fact get a U.S. release following its sale to Ketchup Entertainment, which we revealed several weeks back.


	Rivinoja said there is a very simple thing audiences can do to help avoid future cancellations. “Go to the movies,” she said. “Go to the big ones, go to the small ones, don't just stream them.” 

	











“AI is never going to be as f**ked up in the head as me”


	Artificial intelligence and its dangers has been a hot button topic at this year's Annecy and Rivinoja was unequivocal that The Cat in the Hat has not used the invasive tech in its creation.


	“I feel like AI is never going to be as f**ked up in the head as me so I am not as worried about it coming up with our big ideas,” she joked. “We want to support our artists and support our humans.” 


	For Carloni, some of the “fascination” behind great animated content is to “enjoy and admire the person who created something beautiful.” “Part of our fascination is to enjoy intent as much as content,” he added. “Otherwise you have to think why we still have weightlifting in the Olympics when you can just use a forklift. Our joy comes from enjoying the human endeavor.”


	The movie does use certain software in order to ensure that the rhymes of Dr Seuss' famous feline creation are structured in iambic pentameter, Carloni explained.


	The team talked a packed Annecy crowd through the making of the movie, which stars Bill Hader, Matt Berry and Quinta Brunson and is due for release next year, while showing a number of early-stage clips including one of the infamous ‘Things'. 


	The movie explores what happens at the end of the beloved 1957 Dr Seuss book, Carloni explained, once the cat goes home and visits his “outlandish office,” where he is given assignments.


	“We looked back at the book and wondered why the children become more confident by the end of the books,” added Carloni. “Deep down, is [the cat] the greatest child psychologist of all time? The greatest emotional support animal?”


	The movie is effectively set across three worlds – the cats, the children's and the adventures they journey on – and the production team talked Annecy through the challenges behind making these worlds disparate while keeping to an all-encompassing tone. 


	The movie is due for release next year, 23 years after the previous adaptation starring Mike Myers and Alec Baldwin. The team were speaking at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival.

The former CBS News president and Almar Latour spoke at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit in London about the topic of "Media, Machines, and Mayhem: Truth as a Competitive Advantage." 


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Media companies have made major mistakes in reacting to technological change in the past that must be avoided amid the rise of artificial intelligence. That was the message shared by David Rhodes, executive chairman of Sky News and the former CBS News president, and Almar Latour, CEO of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, both part of News Corp, during an appearance at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit in London on Wednesday.


	They spoke in a session, which was live-streamed and entitled “Media, Machines, and Mayhem: Truth as a Competitive Advantage.”

	“There is a failure of imagination” when it comes to a vision for AI, Rhodes argued. “Right now, we talk about generative AI and talk about answers to prompts, and we think only about text. But what's really important to us is to be a design partner with all of the firms … on what it looks like when something much more compelling happens, which is when these models come for video. We do want that design partnership.” 


	Of course, the appropriate business and financial models for AI companies to use media content remains a key focus and issue of debate. Various media companies have struck licensing deals with one AI company while suing another. “We also want to advocate for good terms of trade, for how our information, how our results turn up in answers to those prompts,” Rhodes highlighted in that context. “We need to not repeat what were the errors of the news media in approaching Web 1.0 and even Web 2.0 and social media, where big mistakes were made.”

	











	Latour echoed that when sharing his company's approach to AI. Dow Jones has struck a licensing deal with OpenAI, but it sued Perplexity AI.


	“We want a commercial arrangement with all the AI platforms. That's the foundation of it. Information has value, and we need to, through a market mechanism, arrive at that value,” he emphasized. Highlighting that Dow Jones spends $1.7 billion every year “to perform the little miracle that is the Wall Street Journal and all of our other information,” he highlighted that nobody can expect to “take all of your productivity from this year… give it away for free, move it into the AI machine,” and take 130 years worth of archives without appropriate pay. “We're not going to let that happen. We need fair value for that, or otherwise, there's not going to be any news,” the CEO concluded.


	He didn't mince words in his follow-up comments. “So we want to strike commercial arrangements. If you do not agree to that, you are a thug, and we'll come after you like a common thief,” Latour shared. “We will see you in court, and we will argue our case. And that may sound belligerent, but it is a necessity.”


	Rhodes on Wednesday didn't comment on the litigation brought by U.S. President Donald Trump against CBS News over how 60 Minutes edited his former opponent Kamala Harris' answer to a question. The two sides have been in mediation talks to try and resolve the suit, with Paramount reportedly to have offered $15 million to resolve the suit. The Federal Communications Commission is also reviewing the interview via its “news distortion” purview while also reviewing CBS parent Paramount Global's deal to sell to Skydance Media. 

	











	So, is there press freedom in the United States right now? “Yes, there is press freedom,” replied Latour. “I get asked this question all the time, particularly when I'm traveling abroad. Our journalists can freely report, and our opinion writers are free to share their free markets, free people philosophy richly.”


	He continued: “There is a free debate. The President, of course, and the administration is free to respond to that, and the decibel level has gone up. But I think there should not be hysteria.” Concluded Latour: “The tension between an administration and established media, or other media, is common. We got clobbered when the Wall Street Journal did a front-page story on President Biden's cognitive decline, and that was not very comfortable. The decibel level has definitely gone up.”


	That conclusion wrapped up the session. “In a world where seemingly every voice has a platform, where narratives can make or break a business, and where public trust in corporations and institutions has rapidly eroded, the mission of global news organizations has never been more vital – or more complex,” its description said.

Young Money is in the building.

	It's a Young Money reunion and the remix, baby. After Nicki Minaj was noticeably absent from Tha Carter VI, the Queen reunited with Lil Wayne for the “Banned From NO (Remix)” on Wednesday (June 11).

	Fans were disappointed after a rumored C6 collaboration didn't come to fruition, but the latest chapter in the Nicki-Wayne lyrical marriage arrived less than a week later, while Minaj emptied the clip with a fiery verse on “Banned From NO (Remix).”

	Nicki crafts a delectable chorus with short-stopping bars, using NBA teams as double entendres for the Indiana Pacers, New York Knicks, and Los Angeles Lakers.

	The Queens icon then dives head-first into her bristling verse, which finds her sniping at NFL player-turned-podcast host Shannon Sharpe, who has been critical of Minaj in the past. 


	“If I send a pic of Shannon you ain't that Sharpe/ Cause you still can't spell Prague and that's horrible,” she raps. 


	Minaj then salutes a classic Wayne bar from the Pharrell-produced “Yes.” “Weezy F Baby and the F is for Phenomenal,” she mimics. 


	Before leaving the burning booth, Nicki wasn't done and she sent a shot at the NFL about their choices for the Super Bowl Halftime Show, which overlooked Wayne in his hometown earlier this year. “NFL, fire some n—s and then call us,” she spews in defense of the Young Money boss. 

	











Tha Carter VI arrived on Friday (June 6) filled with 19 tracks and features from Kodak Black, MGK, Bono, BigXthaPlug, Jelly Roll and Big Sean. The “Banned From NO (Remix)” marks the first Weezy-Minaj collaboration since 2023's “RNB” from Pink Friday 2.

The actress, who played Black Widow in the MCU for 11 years, recently chatted with her 'Black Widow' co-star David Harbour.


							By

Associate Editor


Scarlett Johansson is opening up about the challenges of filming a Marvel film with a large ensemble.


	The actress who played Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe for 11 years recently chatted with David Harbour, her co-star in 2021's Black Widow, for Interview magazine about the difficulty of playing the same character for so many years.




	“Some of the films that I did for Marvel engaged my character more than others,” Johansson admitted. “Like in Captain America: The Winter Soldier with Chris [Evans], we were really dynamic. In some of the other films, the cast was so enormous and there was so much plot to serve that you start to feel like you're a device to move it along. And if you're committed to five and a half months of that, it's like, ‘Okay. I can't paint my nails, I can't get a haircut.' These sound like silly problems, but your identity is wrapped up in this job for a long time, and if you're not doing engaging work as an actor, you feel a little cagey sometimes.”

	Harbour played Alexei in 2021's Black Widow, which served as a prequel, as Johansson's character was killed off in 2019's Avengers: Endgame. However, the Thunderbolts* star understood Johansson's perspective, as he's played Hopper in Netflix's Stranger Things for nearly 10 years, with the fifth and final season releasing later this year.


	“When I started, I loved it so much,” he explained. “Buddies of mine who'd done TV shows for many years said, ‘By season three or four you'll be running.' And I was like, ‘Never! I love all these guys so much.' And then you get to a certain point where you're like, ‘How much more story is there?' You're having to play a lot of the same beat, and there's a feeling where you're like, ‘I want to take a risk. I want to do something that people haven't seen me do before.' So yeah, after 10 years, it's like, ‘Okay.'”

	











	Elsewhere during their conversation, Harbour also mentioned that Johansson was listed as an executive producer on his latest film, Thunderbolts*, at one point. “It's the opening day of a movie that basically you are the seventh Thunderbolt in. Your character is all over this movie…. You are an executive producer on it. Congratulations,” he said.


	Johansson proceeded to clarify that she “asked to have my credit removed because I wasn't involved,” signaling that she was likely credited on the film due to contractual reasons.


	Harbour's Alexei and Florence Pugh's Yelena made their MCU debut in Black Widow before they went on to lead Thunderbolts*. The film also starred Sebastian Stan, Julia Louis Dreyfus, Lewis Pullman, Wyatt Russell, Hannah John-Kamen, Olga Kurylenko and Geraldine Viswanathan.

Tarek and Heather El Moussa's recent trip to Las Vegas was one big, happy family getaway, according to a social media post the HGTV stars shared on June 6, 2025. In the photos and videos Heather posted of the time spent with their parents, there was no mention of any drama.

But on June 10, TMZ reported that Tarek, 43, was cited for battery by Las Vegas police during the trip, after getting into a physical altercation with a man at The Palazzo at the Venetian Resort. The reason? Sources say he was sticking up for his 77-year-old dad.

On June 5, per TMZ, law enforcement got involved when Tarek and another male got into an altercation at the Venetian. The outlet said witnesses at the upscale hotel observed the “Flipping 101” star deliver a “brutal knee to the man's head, knocking him out cold” and that the man looked “seriously roughed up.”

People magazine later reported that the fight occurred when a man allegedly began harassing Tarek's dad. El Moussa received a citation for battery from Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officers, but was not arrested, and neither man requested medical assistance, the outlet said. 

The El Moussas were in town to see Tarek speak and brought their parents — Heather's mom and dad;  Tarek's mom Dominique El Moussa and her second husband, Robert Carroll; and Tarek's dad, Bill Arnould. 

No one in the family has commented on the reports, but Heather shared a happy Instagram post the day after the altercation, on June 6, captioning a photo of the group, “Not our average Vegas trip…Watched Tarek do his thing on stage (so proud!) and made it extra special by bringing our parents along for the ride. We got to show them a glimpse behind the scenes — our world, our work, and of course, the glam. Grateful for these moments that we get to spend together.”

On June 9, Tarek shared multiple videos in his Instagram Stories of himself at Target buying toys for his boys — two-year-old Tristan, whom he shares with Heather, and 10-year-old Brayden, whom he shares with first wife Christina Haack — as well as playing at a playground with them and doing trying virtual reality experience with Brayden. 

“Recap of boys weekend…” he wrote, while Heather was away on a girls' trip,. “Had the best weekend with my boys. This virtual reality was such a cool experience.”

Tarek's parents met and married when they were young, he told Country Living in 2018, explaining, “My dad was raised Catholic in the Middle East in Lebanon and then Egypt. My mom's from Belgium and my dad moved to Europe when he was in his late teens.”

Though they later divorced, both have continued to be deeply involved in Tarek's life. His mom has appeared on his HGTV shows, including on “The Flip Off” in early 2025, and frequently appears in his and Heather's social media posts as a doting mom and grandma. But his dad is seen much more rarely. 

In 2017, Tarek celebrated his dad's 70th birthday by posting a family photo on Facebook and writing, “Happy 70th old man!!! The relationship between a father and his children is so important. I was lucky enough to have a supportive and motivating father that made me believe I could accomplish anything in the world. I can say that I wouldn't be where I am today without the support of my dad. I will take all the lessons I've learned from him and pass it on to my children. So dad Happy Birthday and I love you!”

For Father's Day in 2022, Tarek shared an Instagram photo of himself with his dad and sister, Angelique, and wrote, “I never realized how important a good dad was until later in my life. Looking back, I realize I've found so much of my success through the lessons my dad taught me growing up. We were always together training for baseball. If it wasn't for him, I'm not sure where I'd be today. He always taught me the importance of working hard and building one's confidence. He would never let me quit, he would always teach me to work harder. Now, that I'm a dad, it's my turn to teach these valuable lessons to my kiddos. I hope you all have an amazing Father's Day and happy Father's Day to my dad!❤️”

BTS members Jimin and Jungkook have completed their mandatory military service in South Korea. Tonight, Jungkook addressed fans as they completed their required time in service, just a day after RM and V were also discharged.


	“WE ARE BACK,” wrote Jungkook in an Instagram post alongside a photo of him and Jimin in uniform.

A post shared by Jungkook (@jungkook.97.official)


	Jin was the first to be discharged in June 2024. J-hope came out that October and told Rolling Stone that the time away was “invaluable.” He said, “The thoughts I had during those times have become an inseparable part of me, nurturing and shaping who I am today. Ultimately, they have influenced the stories I tell, the music I aspire to create.”


	Only Suga is left to be released later this month after completing his military service. Suga was assigned social service agent as an alternative to military service, which typically involves a shorter duration. He will be the last BTS member to return. (In South Korea, it is standard for men to begin a 21-month term by their 28th birthday.)

	While no BTS reunion news is confirmed, fans have been expecting the group to get back together this year following their time away.


	“I promise that I'll be back on stage with a more mature side where I always am. I hope ARMY's lives will always be full of laughter and happiness,” wrote Jungkook to fans when he enlisted in November. “I'll miss you deeply while waiting for the day we meet again and talk about something new. Don't get sick and stay healthy. I love you.”

	Following her arrest last month for driving under the influence, four-time Olympic gold medalist Mary Lou Retton said she takes “full responsibility” for her actions.


	“What happened was completely unacceptable. I make no excuses,” she said in a statement to the Associated Press. “To my family, friends and my fans: I have let you down, and for that I am deeply sorry. I am determined to learn and grow from this experience, and I am committed to making positive changes in my life. I truly appreciate your concern, encouragement and continued support.”


	On Tuesday, Retton entered a no contest plea to driving under the influence stemming from the May incident and was fined $100, a standard for first-time, non-aggravated offenses, her attorney Edmund J. Rollo told the outlet. 


	Retton was arrested in West Virginia on May 17 after police in Fairmont pulled her over following a report of a person driving a Porsche erratically. According to a criminal complaint, the former athlete smelled of alcohol, was slurring her words, and failed a field sobriety test. Officers also allegedly saw a wine container in the passenger seat.

	Retton was charged with “driving under influence of alcohol, controlled substances, or drugs,” and released from custody after paying a $1,500 personal recognizance bond.

	At 16, Retton became the first American woman to win the all-around gold medal in gymnastics at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Retton has been retired for more than 30 years, having left after winning the American Cup all-around competition for the third time in 1985.

	











	In October 2023, the Dancing with the Stars alum was hospitalized in the ICU with a rare form of pneumonia. Retton previously detailed the severity of her illness in an interview with Today. “This is serious, and this is life, and I'm so grateful to be here. I am blessed to be here because there was a time when they were about to put me on life support,” Retton shared.

	YEONCHEON, South Korea — Jimin and Jung Kook of BTS were officially discharged from South Korea's mandatory military service on Wednesday (June 11), marking a major step forward in the group's long-awaited reunion.


	With their discharge, six of the seven BTS members have now completed their service obligations, with only SUGA currently fulfilling his alternative service as a social worker. His discharge is expected later this month.

	











	On Tuesday morning, fans and media began gathering near Yeoncheon Public Stadium in Gyeonggi Province to welcome the two stars. Jimin and Jung Kook appeared with bright smiles, offering brief greetings and expressing their sincere gratitude to supporters who had waited for their return.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Thank you to the fans and reporters who came to see us,” Jimin said. “It's been a long time, from the pandemic to military service. Now that we're back, we'll work hard to show you what we've prepared.”


	“There were a lot of unforgettable moments,” Jung Kook added. “Thanks to everyone who served with us and supported us along the way.” Jimin also hinted at what's to come: “Now that I'm discharged, I think it's time we continue drawing the picture we had in mind. We'll prepare well and share it with you soon.” He concluded: “Military life wasn't easy, but I'm grateful for the memories. If you see a soldier on the street, a warm gesture can mean a lot.”

	











	The two enlisted together in late 2023, completing basic training at the same boot camp before being assigned to separate units. Jimin served with the military band under the 5th Infantry Division, while Jung Kook completed his service with the Baekma Division.


	During their time in uniform, both BTS members continued to make waves in the music world. Jimin made history as the first Korean solo artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 with his single “Like Crazy” from the album FACE, while Jung Kook's solo debut GOLDEN peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and earned international acclaim across global charts.


	BTS has been on hiatus from group activities since 2023 as members fulfilled their enlistment obligations but with Jin and j-hope, as well as RM and V as of Tuesday and now Jimin and Jung Kook discharged, the group's full return is right around the corner, only awaiting SUGA's return.


	Their highly anticipated first public reunion is set at the upcoming 2025 BTS FESTA, taking place June 13-14 at KINTEX in Goyang, South Korea. The event promises to be a powerful homecoming celebration for fans worldwide and the start of BTS' next chapter.

The disgraced R&B singer, who's serving more than 30 years in prison for sex crimes, claims jail officials tried to have him killed to keep him from revealing prosecutorial misconduct. 


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



R. Kelly is asking to cut short his 30-plus-year sentence for racketeering, sexual abuse and child pornography based on strange new claims that jail officials tried to solicit a fellow inmate to kill him.


	The disgraced R&B star made the eyebrow-raising allegations in a Tuesday (June 10) court filing asking to be released from the Federal Correctional Institution in Butner, N.C., where he's serving multiple decades after being convicted in two separate criminal cases.


	Kelly claims he's no longer safe behind bars because prison officials are trying to have him killed to keep from revealing prosecutorial misconduct he recently uncovered — namely, that his pre-trial cellmate stole his attorney-client communications and shared these private messages with prosecutors.


	According to the motion, prison officials tried to stop this damaging information from getting out by soliciting fellow inmate Mikeal Glenn Stine, a member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang, to kill Kelly.  Kelly's lawyers say that while Stine ultimately did not go through with the alleged assignment, the threat still lingers.


	“More A.B. members are accumulating at his facility,” reads the filing. “More than one has already been approached about carrying out his murder. One of them will surely do what Mr. Stine has not, thereby burying the truth about what happened in this case along with Robert Kelly.”


	The motion includes signed declarations from both Stine and Kelly's former cellmate. In a statement shared with Billboard, Kelly's attorney, Beau Brindley, said, “The evidence we have before us demonstrates the weaponization of the D.O.J. to pursue a public figure through corrupt and criminal means.”


	Brindley added that Kelly's legal team is seeking clemency from President Donald Trump, saying Trump “is the only one with both the power and the courage” to curb such alleged prosecutorial corruption.


	Prosecutors did not immediately return a request for comment on the motion, but they quickly filed papers of their own asking Judge Martha M. Pacold to strike Kelly's filing, which contained the name of a child victim who was anonymized during his trial.


	“Robert Kelly is a serial sexual predator,” wrote prosecutors. “He even documented his sexual abuse of children on film — creating child pornography — such that the abuse would live on in perpetuity. That abuse and harassment continues with defendant's latest filing.”


	Judge Pacold struck the motion as requested and ordered Kelly's team to refile it with the victim's name properly redacted. The judge set a hearing on the matter for Wednesday (June 11) in Chicago.


	Kelly was convicted of a slew of sex crimes at two separate federal trials. A New York jury found him guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking in 2021, and he was convicted of child pornography and enticing minors for sex in Chicago in 2022.


	The former R&B star was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the New York conviction and 20 years in the Chicago case, although the vast majority of the second sentence will overlap with the first. Both convictions have been upheld on appeal.

Full House star Candace Cameron Bure has raised eyebrows after sharing a number of religious conspiracy theories.

The devout Christian, 49, divided social media after sharing some of her more controversial views on a recent episode of her self-titled podcast.

'I don't even want someone watching a scary movie in our house on the TV because to me that's just a portal,' she explained.

'Listen, I'm in the film industry. I understand how it all works. However, there's still something that can be incredibly demonic while they've made it,' she continued.

'I feel like it's a portal that gets opened up and let in.'

The actress then turned her attention towards canned water brand Liquid Death.

'Do you want to buy a product that is literally being cursed as it's going out into distribution?' she asked.

Bure's son, Lev, who co-hosts the podcast with her, then admitted that he has even stricter boundaries than his pious mother.

Bure revealed that Lev refuses to watch R-rated movies due to things like foul language, nudity and sex.

The episode drew a strong reaction on social media, with many accusing Bure of going too far with her beliefs.

'This is the most bats**t insane rhetoric I've ever heard,' commented one.

'The way none of these people bother to actually step up and call out real harm, violence and evil but will throw a fit about imaginary harm,' wrote another.

A third added, 'Lmfao it's crazy to me that an adult is saying this. Fantasy land. You believe in fairies and unicorns too?'

However, many others were supportive of the star.

The actress, 48, claimed that watching scary movies on TV can open up demonic portals in the home

'Yes. Someone gave my kid an ouija board and I told them to throw it away get it out of my house. I believe in anointing my home and praying to keep anything evil away,' wrote one.

'She is speaking pure wisdom!!!!' a second gushed, while another wrote, 'Speak on it! We must guard our gates!'

Another commented, 'I've always felt like this about scary movies. It was a point of contention in our home because my husband enjoyed these types of films for years. He has come to see it as I do now though.'

Last year, Bure made headlines after sharing a video explaining how to 'vote like Jesus' in the 2024 Presidential election.

The video, which was from Pastor Josh Howerton, suggested that it was 'completely unbiblical' for religious leaders not to comment on politics.

'Thirty million Bible-believing Christians abdicated their spiritual responsibility and did not vote in the last Presidential election. That last election was decided by a strategically placed 42,000 votes,' Howerton said in the sermon.

Bure also made headlines last year when she blasted the controversial tableau at the Olympics.

The showpiece drew some criticism for a banquet scene where an actor playing Greek god Dionysus took centre stage on a table with drag queens, which was interpreted to represent Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper.

Bure blasted the tableau as 'disgusting' and said it made her 'sad and mad' as she spoke out against the piece with her social media followers at the time.

'The Olympic Games have always brought me so much joy. It's the best of the best athletes in the world competing for the title,' she started.

'So to watch such an incredible and wonderful event that's gonna take place over the next two weeks and see the opening ceremonies completely blaspheme and mock the Christian faith with their interpretation of The Last Supper was disgusting,' she continued.

'And it made me so sad. And someone said, 'You shouldn't be sad. You should be mad about it.' And I'm like, 'Trust me. It makes me mad.' But I'm more sad, because I'm sad for souls.'

She captioned the post: 'You asked me to make this shareable on story, so here it is. My take on the Olympic Games Opening Ceremony.

'Since posting, many have tried to correct me saying it wasn't about an interpretation of DaVinci's The Last Supper, but a Greek god and the festival of Dionysus; who is a god of lust, insanity, religious ecstasy, ritual madness etc. I still don't see how that relates to unifying the world through competitive sports and acceptable for children to watch.'

She finished, 'In any case, I'm not buying it. I hope you'll listen all the way through. God loves each and every one of you and His desire is for you to know Him. I won't stop praying and calling on Jesus' name.'

This story is a Media Miss by the right as only 14% is from right-leaning media.

Leland Lehrman was named executive director last month of the MAHA Institute, an advocacy group advancing Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s priorities. Lehrman's appointment comes despite his extensive history of endorsing antisemitic fabrications, including a notorious false document that claims to reveal a secret Jewish plot, as well as advancing conspiracy theories that Israel's intelligence agency was responsible for the 9/11 attacks.

The MAHA Institute, originating as a pro-Kennedy Super PAC, opposes vaccines and spreads COVID-19 conspiracies, with Lehrman leveraging insider knowledge of Kennedy's vaccine policies. Lehrman claimed that the protocols are likely genuine and characterized them as the most comprehensive exposure of Jewish supremacist ideology, suggesting they would trigger a significant political and historical realization.

A recent analysis by a social justice watchdog group specializing in monitoring extremist and far-right activities exposes Lehrman's radical beliefs and indicates that his position at MAHA signals the movement's acceptance of antisemitic conspiracy narratives.

We're just 24 hours away from the premiere of SyFy's new horror series, Revival, and if its Rotten Tomatoes score is any indication of anything, it appears as if the show is going to be a big hit with fans. Based on the Image comics by Tim Seeley and Mike Norton, Revival debuted with a perfect 100%, with some calling it the best SyFy series since Chucky.

"Arriving at a time when zombie stories are teetering on the brink between popular and overplayed, Revival benefits from an approach that doesn't take itself too seriously," said Gavia Baker-Whitelaw from TV Guide in their review. Clint Worthington from RogerEbert.com also had high praise for the series, highlighting its ensemble cast:

"It's really the cast that helps elevate Revival, particularly Scrofano, who carries the entire piece on her resolute shoulders."

These SYFY monster designs are some of the wackiest you will see in a horror movie.

Starring Melanie Scrofano as Dana Cypress, Revival isn't about zombies in the Romero sense of the word, but rather people who come back from the dead with their memories and personality intact that seem just a little off. Set in rural Wisconsin, the town's residents grapple with the miraculous event known as "Revival Day," while a local police officer (Scrofano) investigates a murder mystery where everyone, including both the living and the undead, are suspects. The series also stars Romy Weltman, David James Elliott, Andy McQueen, and WWE superstar CM Punk.

 "It's undeniably the best-looking show on SyFy since Chucky, and the comedy is perfectly executed over the first handful of episodes," noted Alan French from Fandomwire. This spells good news for not only fans, but the network as well, who came under fire for not renewing Chucky for a fourth season. Perhaps Revival can help redeem them in the hearts of some who were deeply disappointed in SyFy and tried so hard to save the series after it was given the ax. 

"Revival does scratch the itch for viewers who want to see more of Scrofano on-screen, while also somewhat serving as a darker spiritual successor to Wynonna Earp in more ways than one," added Carly Lane from Collider. Sarah Fields from Tell-Tale TV was another who had high praise for Scrofano, saying:

"Melanie has a presence that immediately draws you to her. She brings a unique genuineness to her characters that fills any scene she's in."

"Unlike many of its peers, Revival starts strong and only improves,” said Jarrod Jones from AC Club in his review, while Jennifer Griffin from TV Pulse mentioned that the series "plays with some interesting angles on the undead trope," though they do admit that it "struggles however is in its pacing."

All-in-all, it appears as if Revival is going to be one of the summer's must-watch TV shows, and you can check it out when the first of its 10 episodes premieres tomorrow, June 12, on SyFy. Look for them to also stream on Peacock a week after their network debut, but be careful to avoid spoilers if you're going that route, as you'll always be seven days behind everyone else.

Local cop Melanie Scrofano gets a big scare while examining a dead body in a new Collider-exclusive sneak peek from the first episode of Revival. In addition to the dead rising from their graves in the new horror series, she's also dealing with a mysterious murder. It's a reunion between SyFy and Scrofano, who starred in the supernatural action series Wynonna Earp on the network for four seasons. Revival will premiere on SyFy on Thursday, June 12, at 10 p.m. ET; it will stream on Peacock next week.

It's an icy night in the Wisconsin woods when small-town cop Dana Cypress (Scrofano) stops to investigate a dead animal by the side of the road. It shows no sign of life...but she gets the scare of her life when local fitness enthusiast Lester (Peter Millard) pops up behind her. He almost gives her a heart attack, but the Jack LaLanne-styled Lester thinks one could be in her future anyway unless she cuts out the trans fats. Further investigation turns up a dead fox in a trap...and what appears to be several human teeth. Is there a killer on the loose...and if there is, are they among the living, or the undead? You'll have to tune in to Revival on SyFy tomorrow night to find out.

Dead bodies will be the least of Dana's problems in Revival, which is adapted from the Image Comics series of the same name by Tim Seely and Mike Norton. On one snowy day in Wausau, Wisconsin, the recently deceased suddenly cease to be deceased. The event becomes known as "Revival Day" and attracts national attention; meanwhile, Dana is busy tracking down a murderer. This is not a zombie series, however; the dead simply return to life, with no hunger for the brains of the living. In addition to Scrofano, the series also stars Romy Weltman (The Pradeeps of Pittsburgh) as Dana's daughter, Em; David James Elliott (JAG) as her father, Wayne; and Andy McQueen (Mrs. Davis) as Ibrahim Ramin. It also features recurring roles for Steven Ogg (The Walking Dead), Gia Sandhu (The Mysterious Benedict Society), Katherine King So (The Voyeurs), Maia Jae (Rabbit Hole), Nathan Dales (Letterkenny), Mark Little (Mr. D), Glen Gould (Tulsa King), Lara Jean Chorostecki (Hannibal), Conrad Coates (Fargo), and pro wrestler Phil "CM Punk" Brooks.

Canadian actor Scrofano is best known for starring in the title role of SyFy's Wynonna Earp, which concluded with the Tubi-original special Wynonna Earp: Vengeance last year. She also starred on Letterkenny as gin-and-tonic enthusiast Mrs. McMurray, and will return as Captain Marie Batel on the upcoming third season of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.

Revival will premiere on SyFy on Thursday, June 12, at 10 p.m. ET, and will stream on Peacock next week. Stay tuned to Collider for future updates.

It had to happen. 

One of Michael Connelly's oldest characters is yet to be adapted to television. 

The Wheel needs to keep turning somewhere else.

Imagine Partagaz in that hallway.

He will star opposite J.K. Simmons.

But they did!

								A Journal of Analysis and News							



By Umair Khan 

The exchange of insults last week between Pakistan Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi was perhaps ordinary diplomatic sparring on the surface but more than quietly being an in-secret rebalancing of regional diplomacy. This dialogue is proof of a strategic re-think between Kabul and Islamabad on the connectivity of the region and shared economic interests. It is centered on the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) rail corridor project—a game-changing corridor that will redefine the economic and geopolitics of Central and South Asia.

The bilateral Pakistan-Afghanistan relationship has been war-, suspicion-, and security-narrative-oriented so far. Cross-border terrorism, the rise of the Taliban to power, and border-crossing refugees have all maintained a climate of suspicion of each other. But the decision to advance the relationship to the level of full ambassadorial relations itself suggests a clear attempt to move away from that old script. Both countries are eager to experiment with a more pragmatic relationship founded not on ideology or security but mutual strategic and economic interests. The UAP railroad is one actual platform for that change.

Envisioned initially in 2021, the rail link would connect the interior of resource-abundant Uzbekistan with Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar port cities via Afghanistan. It's a simple but persuasive idea: construct a fast, efficient, and inexpensive transportation route that reduces trade friction and opens up new economic opportunities for the three nations. To Central Asian landlocked nations, UAP line presents a worthy substitute for the conventional northward directions through Russia. To Pakistan, it restores its strategic worth as an entry to the Arabian Sea and crossing point between South and Central Asia.

This change of focus also aligns with a larger tendency in international politics, insofar as states increasingly seek cooperation based on converging economic interests, not ideological compatibility. The UAP project aligns with such thinking in promoting connectivity instead of confrontation. It does so in attempting to replicate a form of “functional institutionalism” for regional cooperation on infrastructure, trade, and logistics. Afghanistan, long perceived as instability and uncertainty, is instead being repackaged as not a hinderance but a transit necessity—central to the corridor's success, and regional stability more broadly.

The shift to increase diplomatic outreach isn't politic, however—it's a platform in pursuit of the long-term viability of the railway. When Foreign Minister Dar traveled to Kabul in April 2025, talks focused on outlining the parameters of UAP. The latest follow-up phone call is evidence of continuity of purpose, and this would suggest that both sides recognize long-term benefit in entrenching cooperation. These developments also coincide with growing regional investment interest from China in developing infrastructure, notably as part of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Although the UAP railway is not officially a BRI project, its strategic needs are extremely complementary to China's master plan of regional integration and therefore makes it even more geopolitically relevant.

But the path forward is fraught with difficulty. Albeit in words, assurances notwithstanding, Pakistan cannot be sure the Taliban-infested regime would be in a position to contain militancy, especially from groups such as the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Afghan security is volatile and sensitive to adversity, and it remains doubtful that long-term investment can be made in infrastructure. In addition, non-participation by India in this regional arrangement has strategic implications. While Islamabad, Kabul, and Tashkent converge towards each other, India risks being left behind in a growing connectivity matrix. As Turkiye and China have been developing deepening regional interests, Indian passive strategy can turn into isolation unless India reaffirms engagement with its neighbors in a positive way.

In these conditions, the UAP railway is more than a connectivity project—it's a power of regional transformation. It offers a forum on which economic realism can replace decades of political rigidity. The corridor does create a form of interdependency, however, that, if well managed, can cut across the political pendulum swings and ideology swings of its member states. It is no panacea for the pathologies of the region, but it is a start on the assumption that mutual prosperity can be a safer foundation for peace than mutual suspicion.

The manner in which the recent rounds of Afghan-Pakistan diplomatic negotiations are especially pressing is the nuance with which they introduce a shift towards both sides' postures. Instead of negotiating merely as an issue of security, the two nations appear to be grasping for the long-term dividends of economic membership. This is making way for more integrated diplomacy between both of them, an arena where infrastructure is crafted as a dialogue and stability tool and not necessarily development. The Muttaqi-Dar call might not have been watched in the world, but its effect is historical. It is a sign of a growing movement among regional players to opt for linkage instead of hostility. As the UAP railway project moves ever more rapidly ahead and new efforts at diplomatic normalisation are underway, a new day can be viewed to be on the horizon for Central and South Asia. A time when geography no longer means fate, but opportunity—when diplomacy flows not merely through embassies and communiqués, but through corridors linking countries, markets, and peoples together. If they are preserved, the UAP railway can also easily become a symbol of what regional cooperation can achieve in an increasingly dominated world by infrastructure and interdependence.

A new species of dinosaur that was probably a princely ancestor of T. rex, the king of the dinosaurs, has been identified from fossils excavated in Mongolia.

Scientists have identified a never-before-seen species of dinosaur called the dragon prince — a prehistoric predator that set tyrannosaurs on the path to ruling Earth. This newly discovered relative of Tyrannosaurus rex came to light after researchers re-examined fossils found in Mongolia.

Its existence sheds light on the story of tyrannosaur dinosaurs and how they evolved and spread.

The scientists named the dinosaur the dragon prince of Mongolia (Khankhuuluu mongoliensis), with the genus name based on the Latinization of the Mongolian words for prince and dragon. Their findings were published Wednesday (June 11) in the journal Nature.

"They [tyrannosauroids] were the princes before they took the mantle of kingship," study co-author Jared Voris, a researcher at the University of Calgary in Canada, told Live Science.

Tyrannosauroids were giant apex predators that walked on two legs, had huge heads with sharp teeth and tiny arms. They are part of the larger tyrannosauroid family and were thought to have evolved from smaller species — but until now there has been little fossil evidence to support this idea.

So, Voris set out for Mongolia to examine partial tyrannosauroid skeletons that had been excavated decades ago but not yet fully examined.

"Many of us in the palaeontology community knew that these Mongolian fossils were lurking in museum drawers, waiting to be studied properly, and apt to tell their own important part of the tyrannosaur story," Steve Brusatte, a palaeontologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Edinburgh, U.K., who wasn't involved in the research, told Live Science.

The specimens that really caught Voris' eye were found in Mongolia in 1972 and 1973 and described in a scientific paper in 1977, when the individuals were identified as the already known genus Alectrosaurus.

But after being reexamined, "I realized it was something completely different than anything we'd ever seen," Voris said. "And it actually represented the ancestor of all of our big apex predatory tyrannosaurs that we find both here in Alberta and in Mongolia and China."



The dragon prince lived 86 million years ago and looked much like a tyrannosaur, but it was only about 13 feet (4 meters) long, weighing in at 1,650 pounds (750 kilograms). Many later tyrannosaurs were much bigger, with T. rex reaching 41 feet (12.5 m) long and weighing up to about 23,000 pounds (10,400 kg). The dragon prince also had a smaller head and longer arms compared to later tyrannosaurs.

"It's a nice new discovery giving us a better sense of what this intermediate phase of tyrannosaur history is like," Thomas Holtz, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland, who wasn't part of the team, told Live Science.

Voris thinks the specimens are small adult individuals, rather than young dinosaurs. He identified a slew of features that are indicators of maturity, including fused-up vertebrae, prominently developed small horns and the nasal bone having a wrinkled texture. "The size is representative of the actual species rather than it being a younger animal," Voris said.

However, until a cross-section of the bones is done to look at growth rings, which hasn't yet been permitted because of the rare status of the fossils, we can't be sure of this adult status, Holtz said.

Unlike later tyrannosaurs, K. mongoliensis probably didn't hunt sauropods, the huge herbivorous dinosaurs with the long necks and long tails, said study co-author Darla Zelenitsky, a paleontologist at the University of Calgary. "It was probably taking down prey smaller than itself," Zelenitsky told Live Science.

The finding suggests that tyrannosauroids were still small at the time, and only later became giants.

"What makes the specimens so important is their age. They are about 86 million years old, a good 20 million years older than T. rex," Brusatte said. "It shows that tyrannosaurs were still relatively small at this time, and only later did they become colossal."

The researchers also compared 12 species of tyrannosaurs to figure out when and where they lived, how they were related, and when any migrations might have taken place.

They found that, about 85 million years ago, K. mongoliensis, or a closely related species, migrated out of Asia into North America across a land bridge where the Bering Strait is now and gave rise to the first true tyrannosaurs. These went on to be the dominant predators in North America in the latter part of the Cretaceous period between about 85 million and 66 million years ago.

But about 78 million years ago, a tyrannosaur migrated back across the land bridge, resulting in their first appearance in Asia.

This resulted in the evolution of two tyrannosaur subgroups in Asia: huge ones weighing several tons like Tarbosaurus bataar, and smaller, slim ones such as Qianzhousaurus sinensis, which was nicknamed "Pinocchio rex" because of its small size and long snout.

During a third migration, about 68 million years ago, one of the giant tyrannosaur species from Asia traveled back to North America and probably gave rise to T. rex, Zelenitsky said.

"They show that a few big migration events back and forth between Asia and North America were the drivers of much of tyrannosaur evolution," Brusatte said. "The tyrannosaur family tree was shaped by migration, just like so many of our human families."

How can radio astronomers successfully identify extraterrestrial radio signals while discerning them from Earth-based radio signals? This is what a recent study published in The Astronomical Journal hopes to address as a team of researchers investigated how machine learning could be used to search for extraterrestrial technosignatures while simultaneously identifying radio contamination from human radio signals.

This study has the potential to help radio astronomers develop more efficient methods in searching for and identifying radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations.

The study was led by Snir Pardo from the School of Physics and Astronomy at Tel-Aviv University in Israel, whose team collaborated with the Breakthrough Listen project to obtain spectrograms from more than 300 stars less than 50 parsecs (163 light-years) from Earth. Spectrograms are data graphs that display the time and frequency of radio signals and are a common method in radio astronomy, with the researchers using the Parkes Observatory and Green Bank Observatory located in Australia and West Virginia, U.S., respectively, that are managed by the Breakthrough Listen project.

What makes this study unique is the researchers used a combination of computer models and machine learning algorithms to analyze the data with the goal of identifying candidate signals that could originate from an extraterrestrial technosignature and not from a human source radio signal.

The study notes, "SETI [Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence] exemplifies the challenge of identifying new phenomena in vast, noisy data sets. We leveraged a minimal set of assumptions and simple operations, in order to search efficiently for technosignatures in radio observations of nearby stars.

"Of the 1,011 spectrograms of more than 300 nearby stars that we analyzed, we visually inspected about 20,000 of the most promising candidates and ruled them all out. Future work should explore incorporating adaptive multiscale techniques to further automate the vetting process and expand search efficiency."

The Breakthrough Listen project is an astronomy project whose goal is to identify technosignatures of radio and laser communications using the aforementioned Parkes Observatory and Green Bank Observatory while being based at the Berkeley SETI Research Center. It was founded in 2016 and has surveyed more than 1 million stars, including all 43 stars located within 5 parsecs (16.3 light-years) from Earth.

While no confirmed technosignatures have yet to be received by scientists on Earth, the closest humanity has come to receiving a signal from another world happened August 15, 1977. This was when a 72-second signal was received by the Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope but went unknown for several days until astronomer Jerry R. Ehman evaluated the data and discovered the radio signal was so intense that he circled the data and wrote "Wow!" next to it.

Despite several attempts to obtain a similar signal from its supposed origin of the constellation Sagittarius, astronomers couldn't find another signal like it and have yet to receive anything close to the intensity of this original signal.

This study demonstrates how the SETI Institute continues to broaden its methods for using radio astronomy in searching for and identifying radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations, noted as technosignatures here.

Aside from using radio astronomy to search for technosignatures, the goal of SETI is to broaden our understanding of searching for life beyond Earth through collaborations on active and retired space missions, including Cassini, New Horizons, Opportunity, Curiosity, Kepler, and TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite).

As machine learning continues to advance, so will its ability to potentially identify technosignatures from outside Earth and demonstrate that we might not be alone in the universe.

Barron Trump, the youngest son of U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, is reportedly in a relationship with a fellow NYU student — but you wouldn't know it from the viral rumors flooding social media. While the 19-year-old keeps a low profile at college and is said to be happily dating someone who shares his love for privacy, the internet has spun an entirely different story.

From a bizarre viral video claiming he is “secretly married” to WNBA superstar Caitlin Clark, to an AI-generated deepfake linking him romantically with Spanish royal Princess Leonor, Barron has become unexpected tabloid bait. Yet, sources close to the NYU student insist the truth is far more grounded and far more private. “Barron has a really nice girlfriend and hangs out with her a lot,” an insider told NewsNation, noting that the relationship appears serious and intentionally kept under wraps.

Despite having secret service agents nearby at all times, Barron has managed to carve out a modest social life, including dating. “He can have a girlfriend — the Secret Service knows how to manage that,” a political source told PEOPLE. “Anyone who says otherwise doesn't understand how this works.” While it may not be ideal for a teenager looking for normalcy, insiders insist that Barron's relationship has not been hindered.

Though he has been previously speculated to have dated TikToker @maddatitude, that rumor was largely debunked — she never applied to NYU, and her social media-forward lifestyle doesn't align with Barron's extremely private nature. “He's not trying to be the big man on campus,” said a fellow NYU student, adding that Barron is far more like his mother than his headline-grabbing father.

Most NYU students appear to respect Barron's space. When his enrollment was first reported, reactions were mostly supportive. “He didn't choose this life,” one student told the Daily Mail. “His dad is his dad, and he's his own person.” Kaya Walker, former NYU College Republicans president, added that Barron is largely apolitical and stays under the radar — attending classes and heading straight home afterward. Even though AI fantasies and fabricated marriage theories continue to swirl online, the real Barron Trump seems focused on something far more relatable: building a quiet, meaningful connection — and trying to live a normal college life, one that's anything but ordinary when you're a Trump.

THR goes inside a book launch party for Day's latest book, ‘The Prism,' hosted by Kevin Huvane and Oscar nominee Demi Moore at the home of the CAA power player on a recent May evening.


							By 

	Chris Gardner



Kevin Huvane, one of Hollywood's most powerful and respected agents, happened to be in New York City about 32 years ago with client and friend Demi Moore when the movie star suggested an introduction to someone “really, really special” in her life. 


	The first name that came to Huvane's mind was the man most closely associated with Moore at the time, Bruce Willis. Nope, not him. “You had already had Rumer and I met her already,” Huvane recalled, referencing the eldest of Moore's three daughters with ex-husband Willis. Turns out it wasn't a relative, a fellow movie star or even an auteur. Over dinner at Nobu in New York, Moore introduced Huvane to that special someone, whom she described has having the credentials of an impressive multi-hyphenate: “a friend, a guidance counselor, a psychiatrist, a therapist and a healer.”

	“I fell in love with Laura Day that night,” Huvane said on a recent May evening while holding a microphone and standing next to Day and Moore on the back patio of his stunning Beverly Hills property with sweeping views of the entire city of Los Angeles. “From that moment on, she became part of our trio.”

	That three had good reason to reunite that night because in addition to her aforementioned titles, Day is also a New York Times best-selling author. Huvane opened his home to celebrate the publication of her latest tome titled The Prism: Seven Steps to Heal Your Past and Transform Your Future. Published by Spiegel & Grau, the book follows her other efforts Practical Intuition, Practical Intuition in Love, Practical Intuition for Success, The Circle, Welcome to Your Crisis and How to Rule the World From Your Couch. The Prism, described as part memoir and part self-help guide to overhauling one's life, is dedicated to “the four corners of my reality” including her writer-producer husband Stephen Schiff (The Americans), “son and sun” Samson Day, “exegete” Herschel Goldfield and Huvane, whom she dubbed “my rock.”

	











	He should also be credited for having the wittiest one-liner of the night. During his brief introduction, Huvane noted how Day wanted to write a book and Moore helped push it along, even suggesting that she promote it on Oprah Winfrey's beloved daytime talk show. The anecdote caused Day to interject, “You stole my story.” Without missing a beat, Huvane quipped, “You should have known that.” The crowd — filled with actors (Lucy Hale, Jurnee Smollett), comedians (Tig Notaro, Jack Whitehall), power players (Greg Berlanti, Robbie Rogers), agents (CAA's Tracy Brennan, Jaime Feld, Ryan Abboushi), Housewives (Kyle Richards, Erika Jayne) and authors (Gregg Hurwitz) — ate it up. 


	Despite joking about Day's ability to see the future, Huvane did say he hates the word psychic and much prefers intuitive. “The Prism is one of those things where you read this book, work it and it will change your life,” he praised. “Laura fully believes we have this in all of us, and that if you take care of it and you nurture it, you can use it and it's going to help your life.” 


	With that, Huvane handed the microphone over to Moore who then detailed just how close she's been to Day over the decades. “Laura is one of if not my oldest friend. We've known each other at this point, I think 37 or 38 years,” said the best actress Oscar nominee for The Substance. “Laura has been given and was born with an incredible gift. But what's different about Laura than others who may share in similar gifts is that she has taken the time to hone her gift — to find a way to take what she was naturally given and make it targeted and precise and utilize that for her day job with Fortune 500 companies.”

	











	Moore said Day passes that knowledge along in The Prism and she suggested that the guests at the party pick up a copy on their way home and find a small cluster of friends to workshop the book together “to share in an experience and work together truly in community” to transform “to even higher and greater states.” 


	It was a quite an endorsement from Moore, who looked glowing and relaxed at the celebration as it was filled with friends and fellow industry insiders. She and Huvane then looked on with wide smiles as Day took the microphone and read prepared remarks that began with another sidestep around the term psychic. 


	“I call myself a practicing intuitive,” Day explained. “But that's really just a polite name for a psychic. It takes a lot of courage to say, ‘This weirdo is one of my people,' so a blanket thank you to all of you who have done just that by being here tonight.”


	She then credited a group of researchers for helping firm up what would one day become her livelihood. “I didn't know over 40 years ago when I stumbled into a group of researchers who were interested in extrasensory perception that my unhealthy neurology — the brain that refused to remember the periodic table or what year it was but could travel around in space and time — would become my career. What made me weird and unpopular in the third grade has brought me all of you, and lucky me.”

	











	Day, who overcame tragedy after the respective suicides of her mother, brother and sister, did not reveal her client list or how much she charges for her services (though several at the party whispered that her hourly rate is in the range of $10,000). But what she did say is that she specializes in what she calls data points. “People ask me everything, and I don't say, you should do this or you shouldn't do this. I give pieces of data,” she told THR. “I might tell an actor, ‘I feel like your co-star may drop out in May, and I have a feeling that this isn't the first time it's happened.' Since I don't know who the co-star is, they can check it out and see if I'm right about that. But I really only work for people who know what they're doing anyway — A VC firm, producers, studios, people who know what they're doing. They use me to find out things that happen out of the blue that they couldn't have expected or just to verify that they're going in the right direction or that their calculations are correct.” 


	Those services may be pricey but The Prism is not, both the book and the practice it preaches. 


	“Intuition is a part of all of my books, but my intuition has led me to the crucial need to work on the architecture of self. I use the prism as a metaphor for our structure, the way that we take the energy we all share, refract it through our human structure or what we call the ego, to create our world. But ego has gotten at rap. If I called my book The Ego, well, no one wants to come to a party celebrating that, but you need an ego. The ego is everything that begins with ‘I.' I love. I want. I build. I create. I hold. When you heal your ego — your prism — you heal your business, your relationships and your life.” Even in Hollywood.
