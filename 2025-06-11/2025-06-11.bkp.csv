            France said it has received a letter from the Palestinian Authority that contains “concrete and unprecedented commitments” to reform as Paris prepares to co-chair a conference on Palestinian statehood in New York.
    


            The letter, which France said was signed by Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas, includes condemnation of the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, a call on Hamas to immediately release all hostages, and pledges to hold elections and reform the authority, according to excerpts shared with CNN.
    


            “Hamas will no longer rule Gaza and must hand over its weapons and military capabilities to the Palestinian Security Forces, which will oversee their removal outside the occupied Palestinian territory, with Arab and international support,” the Élysée Palace cited Abbas as writing.
    


            The letter France says it received comes as anticipation builds around whether President Emmanuel Macron might recognize the State of Palestine at a summit next week aimed at building support for Palestinian statehood at the United Nations. France is co-chairing the summit with Saudi Arabia.
    


            Hussein Al-Sheikh, vice president of the PA, confirmed to CNN that the Palestinian presidency sent the letter to France.
    


            France said Abbas pledged to organize presidential and general elections within a year in order to “rejuvenate the Palestinian governance.”
    


            Abbas, 89, is deeply unpopular among Palestinians. He has led the PA since the death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in 2004 and has clung to power despite being seen by critics as lacking democratic legitimacy. Proposals put forth by Arab states for a post-war Gaza have excluded Hamas from governance and called for the reformation of the PA.
    


The Guardian reported on Saturday that France may be retreating from its plan. The conference “has weakened its ambition and will instead hope to agree on steps towards recognition,” The Guardian said, citing diplomats, adding that “French officials briefing their Israeli counterparts this week reassured them the conference will not be the moment for recognition.”

            However, an Élysée source told CNN that the French presidency refutes such reports, and that Paris is moving in the direction of recognizing a Palestinian state.
    


            “We can clearly see that some have an interest in suggesting that we are not moving in the direction of recognition. That is false,” the source said Tuesday, adding that “we are determined to recognize a Palestinian state in order to create the conditions for the state's existence.”
    


            The source highlighted the importance of the upcoming conference at the UN.
    


            “Recognizing Palestinian statehood is consistent with France's position in support of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people,” the source said. “As part of the June 18 conference, it must contribute meaningfully to the momentum behind implementing the two-state solution, based on the principles reaffirmed by the President of the Republic.”
    


            France would be the most prominent Western country to recognize Palestinian statehood. Last year, Spain, Ireland and Norway formally recognized the State of Palestine in a move that provoked backlash from Israel.

            • Curfew order: Police have started “mass arrests” of protesters after an emergency curfew came into effect for part of downtown Los Angeles. It will be in place from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. local time and will likely be in effect for a few days, Mayor Karen Bass said.
    


• National Guard deployed in Texas: Members of the Texas National Guard will be deployed to various locations in the state ahead of planned protests this week, Gov. Greg Abbott said. The Republican governor said the Guard “will use every tool & strategy to help law enforcement maintain order.”
    


• Growing arrest count: The number of people arrested during the protests has jumped day to day since Saturday. The LAPD chief said nearly 200 were taken into custody Tuesday – before the curfew. The mayor said that 23 businesses were looted during four days of protests.
    


• Emergency order: A federal judge has denied California's request for an immediate restraining order that would temporarily prohibit the Trump administration from using the Marines and the National Guard to enforce laws in the state, including immigration enforcement. Senior US District Judge Charles R. Breyer set a hearing for Thursday.
    


• Marines on standby: About 700 Marines have been activated to help protect federal personnel and property. They are standing by and awaiting orders outside LA, and many of them are undergoing additional training prior to assisting with the protests, US officials told CNN.
    


Our live coverage of the unrest in Los Angeles and around the US has moved here.



            A curfew is currently in place in part of downtown Los Angeles, with police saying they have begun arresting protesters Tuesday evening. Scattered demonstrations have also popped up in multiple cities across the US, with Texas deploying the National Guard in response.
    


Here are the latest developments:



            Inspired by demonstrations in Los Angeles, protesters in Texas have gathered in recent days to challenge the Trump administration's sweeping immigration crackdown.
    


            Like California, the Lone Star State is home to one of the country's largest immigrant populations. Over the past few days, demonstrators have said they are speaking out for members of their community, many who fear taking to the streets themselves.
    


            “Immigrants are the backbone of our society. Once again, they are all of us. They are our family members. They are our community members,” Laiba Khan, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, told CNN affiliate KEYE.
    


            What began as a show of solidarity devolved into chaos in Austin on Monday, when police declared an unlawful gathering outside the J.J. Pickle Federal Building, later deploying tear gas on demonstrators, KEYE reported.
    


            Another protest near the State Capitol building, also in Austin, ended with law enforcement deploying tear gas and pepper rounds, the Texas Department of Public Safety said.
    


            Thirteen people were arrested in the city, police said.
    


            About 180 miles away in Dallas, video from a Monday demonstration shows a tense standoff unfolding between protesters and police in riot gear. Several demonstrators, their faces covered with bandanas and masks, were heard shouting expletives.
    


            An observer told CNN that police used what he believes was mace on a person being restrained and another person attempting to intervene.
    


            Hundreds gathered outside San Antonio's City Hall on Sunday in a protest that remained peaceful, CNN affiliate KSAT reported. Ahead of more demonstrations in the southern Texas city, Mayor Ron Nirenberg urged residents to “exercise their rights…safely and responsibly.”
    


            Nirenberg's calls for calm come after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced the deployment of the Texas National Guard, ahead of the planned protests.
    


            “The reports of the Governor deploying the National Guard to our community underscore the need for us to remain peaceful and safe this weekend,” Nirenberg said.
    


            Members of the Texas National Guard will be deployed to various locations in the state ahead of planned protests this week, Gov. Greg Abbott said Tuesday.
    


            South Texas organizations are expected to hold anti-ICE rallies on Wednesday and Saturday, CNN affiliate KSAT reported. Among the demonstrations is a “No Kings” protest in San Antonio this Saturday.
    


            Abbott's announcement comes a day after authorities used tear gas and pepper ball projectiles to disperse demonstrators at Austin's State Capitol Complex.
    


            “Peaceful protest is legal,” Abbott said in a post on X. “Harming a person or property is illegal and will lead to arrest.”
    


            The Republican governor said the Guard “will use every tool & strategy to help law enforcement maintain order.”
    


            Photojournalist Toby Canham was covering the protests in downtown Los Angeles on Sunday when he was caught in the crossfire – and shot by a rubber bullet to the head.
    


            “I'm just standing there working, and then all of a sudden … I mean, I was sort of semi-conscious of the fact that the guy was aiming at me or aiming in my direction, and that thing traveled so quickly. Next thing I knew, I was just flattened, it struck me on the head and I was down,” he told CNN's Laura Coates on Tuesday.
    


            The rubber bullet left a large red mark on his forehead that was still visible on Tuesday. He went to the hospital afterward but wasn't otherwise injured, he said.
    


            The crowd of protesters on Sunday was large, he said, estimating it reached several thousand people at its peak.
    


            “The initial response from law enforcement, you know, there was no standoff. It was almost like straight into it with the tools at their disposal to hold people back,” he said. “And there are obviously people in that crowd angry, lashing out at police, and objects being thrown and stuff like that.”
    


            CNN has reached out to LAPD for comments.
    


            The Los Angeles Police Department said late Tuesday it had begun carrying out “mass arrests” after several protest groups continued to gather in the designated curfew zone.
    


            “Multiple groups continue to congregate on 1st St between Spring and Alameda,” the LAPD wrote on X.



                    “Those groups are being addressed and mass arrests are being initiated.”
                





            In an earlier post about an hour before the curfew took effect, the LAPD said “dozens of arrests” had been made for failure to disperse.
    


Correction: A previous version of this post incorrectly described arrests that were made after curfew. Police reported that “mass arrests” were taking place.



            Roughly 10 to 20﻿ people were seen being apprehended in the curfew area, according to CNN's team on the ground.
    


            One person was seen being physically restrained and placed on the ground, hands zip-tied behind his back.
    


            Most protesters have already left the curfew area, and police took their time to clear the vicinity, CNN's Nick Watt said from the scene.
    


            Meanwhile, a helicopter from the California Highway Patrol is flying roughly 1,000 feet above Little Tokyo in downtown Los Angeles, where the curfew is being enacted, according to flight tracking data.
    


            A curfew is in place for parts of downtown Los Angeles until 6 a.m. Pacific Time. It only applies to a small patch of the city - an area of about 1 square mile - but, according to retired Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, it may play an important role in de-escalating protests and allowing peaceful demonstrators to go home.
    


            “I think it gives officers a time to rest a little bit,” said Johnson, who led the response to the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a police officer in 2014.
    


                    “The protesters that are there legally protesting will go home. It's agitators that are still around. And so it'll separate the crowd and it gives a chance for a partnership,” he said. 
                





            LAPD officers, he added, will “give them several opportunities to disperse … But then at some point they will say, ‘This is our final order,' and they will have to go through with that.”
    


            Anti-ICE protesters gathered in Denver on Tuesday, the Associated Press reported, carrying cardboard signs including one that read “Show your faces. ICE cowards.”
    


             The group marched through different thoroughfares and disrupted traffic, with police arriving to block streets behind the marchers, according to AP.
    


            A spokesperson from the Denver Police Department told CNN they had not deployed any tear gas, contrary to some reports.
    


                    “We are contacting a large group of protesters in the area of Broadway and I-25. We're getting reports that people are saying tear gas is deployed - we have not deployed any tear gas,” she said. 
                





            A curfew has been enacted in a pocket of downtown Los Angeles, where demonstrations in the city have been concentrated. It is set to expire at 6 a.m. Pacific Time.
    


            The area is roughly 1 square mile, Mayor Karen Bass said. A law enforcement source familiar with the situation told CNN fewer than 100,000 of LA's 4 million residents will be affected, .
    


            “Any person who remains engaged in unlawful assembly or criminal activity will be detained and arrested,” the Los Angeles Police Department said in a recent post on X.
    


            Multiple lines of law enforcement including National Guardsmen and Homeland Security agents were seen stationed outside a detention facility in the curfew area, according to CNN's Nick Watt, who is on the ground.
    


                    “There are definitely people here who feel strongly about this cause,” Watt said. “There are also people, I can tell you, who are here to cause trouble.” 
                





            Nearly 200 people were arrested on Tuesday, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell told press today.
    


Watch a helicopter searchlight on the crowd in downtown LA after the curfew went into effect:



            Members of the Trump administration reacted to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's Tuesday night address, in which he warned the American people that “democracy is under attack.”
    


            In response, White House Director of Communications Steven Chung rebutted “NewScum must've hired Kamala and Biden's loser campaign team because he saying this is a ‘threat to democracy,' in a post on X.



            Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller chimed in on X stating, “The entire Democrat Party is committed to the singular proposition of migrant flooding every city in the USA.”
    


            In a post on X, White House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson called such a response “Newsom playbook 101: blaming his own incompetence on President Trump. Lame and predictable!”
    


Some context: After the governor's address was plagued by technical issues, Newsom's team apologized for a momentary silence, jokingly attributing “Trump-era transparency rules” for the delay in broadcast.
    


            Dozens of police in riot gear, holding batons, have surrounded a federal building in downtown Chicago, where a small group of protesters continue to honk and shout at officers.
    


            The scene remains tense but is much calmer compared to some hours ago, when Chicago police were in physical interactions with protesters at an intersection.
    


            Earlier video from CNN affiliate WBBM showed a car plowing through protesters on Monroe Street and Wabash Avenue during a large and mostly peaceful protest.
    


            The car appeared to clip pedestrians holding signs and a bicyclist.
    


            CNN is working to determine whether any arrests have been made throughout the day.
    


            Dozens of demonstrators surrounded Foley Square in downtown Manhattan, near a government building that houses the city's Immigration Customs and Enforcement office and main immigration court.
    


            At roughly 10:30 p.m. ET, a small group of protesters was seen surging toward police who appeared to be making arrests while blocking demonstrators off with metal barricades.
    


            The scene was relatively tame compared to just over an hour earlier, when clashes between police and protesters led to several arrests in the same area.
    


            Roughly 45 arrests have been made in New York City this evening, a law enforcement source told CNN. 



            In his address to Californians Tuesday evening, Gov. Gavin Newsom warned of the danger to America's democracy and accused Congress of bowing to President Donald Trump.
    


            “Democracy is under assault before our eyes, this moment we have feared has arrived,” he said. Trump is “taking a wrecking ball, a wrecking ball to our Founding Fathers' historic project – three co-equal branches of independent government. There are no longer any checks and balances.”
    


                    “Congress is nowhere to be found,” he added. “Speaker (Mike) Johnson has completely abdicated that responsibility. The rule of law has increasingly been given way to the rule of Don.”
                





            He urged the public to stand up for their democracy, but cautioned: “If you exercise your first amendment rights, please do it peacefully.”
    


            Johnson told reporters Tuesday that Newsom — who has aggressively criticized the Trump administration's moves — “ought to be tarred and feathered.”
    


            As protests continue in Los Angeles, about 700 Marines have been activated to help protect federal personnel and property. CNN speaks with LA residents to get their reactions.
    


            “Having troops in a civilian American neighborhood does not make anyone safer at all,” said resident Daniel Fabiano.
    


            Another resident, Priscilla Martinez, said: “I feel safe around the protests. I don't feel safe around the military at the moment.”
    


            Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass' office shared a graphic of the borders of area impacted by the curfew in downtown Los Angeles.
    


            It will be in place from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. local time. Only limited groups don't have to abide by the curfew, including law enforcement, emergency and medical personnel, people traveling to and from work and credentialed media, according to the mayor's office.
    


            Video from the anti-ICE protest tonight in New York City shows NYPD detaining multiple individuals. Several protesters can be seen on the ground as officers attempt to handcuff them.
    


            Protesters can be heard calling the officers “terrorists” as the arrests happen.
    


            President Donald Trump in his response to protests invoked a rarely used law to federalize the National Guard over the objection of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom and local officials.
    


            This law cites three reasons for that extraordinary step to be taken: the US, or any of the Commonwealths or possessions, is invaded or in danger of invasion by a foreign nation; there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the US government; or the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the US. In citing all three, the White House indicates that these protests are the equivalent of invasion, rebellion and something the US government doesn't feel like it can handle without the military. Read CNN's Zachary B. Wolf's analysis on whether Trump can lawfully take control of California's national guard.
    


Perception vs. reality: The National Guard and the Marines aren't actually allowed to conduct law enforcement. Unless Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, the guard is restricted to protecting federal property and personnel. The Marines, while mobilized, haven't yet been called in to respond. But to hear Trump tell it, his decision to call in the troops has made all the difference in putting down violent demonstrations. In a social media post, he said “If I didn't ‘SEND IN THE TROOPS' to Los Angeles the last three nights, that once beautiful and great City would be burning to the ground right now.” Read CNN's Aaron Blake's analysis of Trump's messaging on the protests.
    


Democrats in a bind: Democrats are forced back onto politically perilous turf, as they look for ways to condemn his actions without being drawn into a broad debate over immigration or tying themselves to the chaotic scenes emerging from Los Angeles.
    


Misinformation is rife: Offline, in real-world Los Angeles, most Angelenos are having a perfectly normal day. But online, the fires and riots are still raging. The powerful algorithms that fuel social media platforms are feeding users days-old and sometimes completely fake content about the recent unrest in L.A.
    


Trump defends decision: During a visit to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Trump defended sending the National Guard and the Marines to Los Angeles. “We will use every asset at our disposal to quell the violence and restore law and order right away,” Trump said. “We're not going … to wait for a governor that's never going to call and watch cities burn,” he added.
    


David Huerta: A revered California labor leader, Huerta was arrested on Friday for his involvement in protests decrying immigration raids in Los Angeles. Demonstrators came out nationwide Monday to demand his release and after three nights of detention, Huerta was released on a $50,000 bond Monday afternoon. He remains charged with conspiracy to impede an officer, a felony that could result in up to six years in prison, according to the US Attorney's Office.
    


            Immigration and Customs Enforcement posted images on X today of officers detaining individuals in Los Angeles while surrounded by National Guard troops, in what appears to be the first photos marking the Guard involved in ICE operations.
    


            The Trump administration deployed thousands of National Guard troops to California, casting it as a necessary move to quell protests in Los Angeles that erupted in a section of the city over ICE enforcement actions.
    


            Multiple sources told CNN the National Guard's focus while in Los Angeles was to protect property and personnel. They do not have authority to arrest.
    


            Images shared by ICE on X show authorities arresting individuals, as troops stand by, appearing to guard the area around the operation — in other words, serving as security perimeter. ICE dubbed the image: “Photos from today's ICE Los Angeles immigration enforcement operation.”
    


            DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that troops are on the ground to provide protection from federal law enforcement officers and property.
    


            “If any rioters attack ICE law enforcement officers, military personnel have the authority to temporarily detain them until law enforcement makes the arrest. The violence against ICE law enforcement must end,” she said.
    


            Former senior ICE officials who spoke to CNN couldn't recall any time the National Guard had been involved in an ICE interior operation.  



“Even if lawful, however, the idea of the National Guard supplementing ICE officers on interior enforcement is almost certainly a first,” John Sandweg, former acting ICE director during the Obama administration, said.
    


            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth celebrated the move on X, posting one of the images and saying: “This We'll Defend.”
    


            Officials who enacted a curfew in parts of downtown Los Angeles assess that fewer than 100,000 of the city's nearly 4 million residents actually live within the zoned off area, a law enforcement source familiar said.
    


            While numerous corporations and other businesses are based in the downtown area, the source said officials believe the 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew will affect only a relatively small number of residents, which was a factor in determining the start and end time of the order.
    


            LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell said residents of the impact area will be exempt from the curfew.
    


            Officials have stressed that nightly LA protests, which have at times turned violent, are typically relegated to a small portion of the downtown area.

Follow:


            A rare, first-generation Labubu figure has sold for $150,000 in Beijing at an auction held exclusively for the toys that have taken the world by storm.
    


            The 131-centimeter (51-inch) mint green figurine with a gremlin-like appearance, sharp teeth and puckish grin went for 1.08 million yuan ($150,325) at the Yongle International Auction house that normally specializes in selling jewelry and modern art.
    


            “Congratulations to the online buyer on collecting the world's only such one,” said the auctioneer at an exhibition center in downtown Beijing on Tuesday afternoon.
    


            Labubus are currently the trendiest plush toys on the planet, created by Hong Kong-born illustrator Kasing Lung and retailed by the Chinese toy giant Pop Mart.
    


            In recent months, the bunny-bodied, elf-faced creatures — equal parts grotesque and adorable — have soared in popularity, sparking buying frenzies around the world, and in some cases, brawls among fans outside shops selling them.
    


            Even in China, where Pop Mart is based and most of its toys are made, people are struggling to get their hands on Labubus.



            A total of 48 Labubus were auctioned at the special event, billed as the “World's First” auction of first generation collectible Labubus.
    


            A brown, 160-centimeter (63-inch) Labubu figure, sold for $114,086, the second highest hammer price at the event. The company said only 15 such figures exist around the world.
    


            Other figures went for more than $1,000 each.
    


            “As a trendy toy in China, Labubu is now becoming a global artwork as it has truly sparked a craze around the world,” Zhao Xu, the founder of Yongle Auction, told state-owned outlet The Beijing News.
    


            Zhao said the company plans to hold monthly livestream auctions for Labubu and other trendy artworks.
    


            A pair of Minions-like Labubus sold at auction for 10,000 yuan ($1,391).
    


            Buyers at the auction also had to pay an additional 15% brokerage fee on top of the hammer prices.
    


            And it's not rare to see a price inflation of Labubus due to the crazy demand in China. For instance, a blind box from the latest Labubu 3.0 series, originally priced at around $81, has been selling for up to $278 on the second-hand market, state-owned outlet Cover News reported.
    


            Labubu's viral popularity has been a booster for Pop Mart. Annual results show that the Chinese company's global gross profit surged by over 125% last year, while its revenue in mainland China reached more than $1.09 billion, 34% higher than 2023.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Biden's spies tracked Musk's foreign guests","https://www.rt.com/news/618942-musk-visitors-federal-investigation/","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 08:11:00 GMT","

US federal agencies investigated foreign nationals visiting Elon Musk's properties during the administration of former President Joe Biden, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The investigation, conducted by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice from 2022 to 2023, reportedly did not result in any charges. They focused on individuals from Eastern Europe and other regions “who might have been trying to influence” Musk, the outlet said.

The tech tycoon has access to classified US information through his companies' government contracts but was reportedly not granted clearance for some of the most sensitive secrets tied to SpaceX. In 2022, he stepped into national politics by acquiring Twitter – now known as X – whose management he accused of suppressing conservative viewpoints on the platform.

In 2024, Musk used his wealth and clout to support Donald Trump's bid to reclaim the presidency. Until recently, he served as a special member of the Trump administration with a mandate to reduce government waste. Their alliance appeared to unravel last week after they exchanged insults online over a crucial spending bill.

The WSJ claimed that Musk's repeated interactions with non-Americans raised concerns among his political allies. A source within the political action committee that Musk formed to support Trump told the newspaper that staff “had to institute extensive vetting to keep foreigners out.”

Prior to Trump's election victory last November, the newspaper also alleged that Musk had been in covert contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin – which it characterized as a potential national security issue.

Both Musk and the Kremlin have denied the report. Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov called it “absolute lies,” stating last October that the only conversation between Putin and Musk was a single phone call years ago regarding technological innovation.

Following his fallout with Trump, some Democratic officials speculated that Musk – who has said he previously voted for Democratic candidates – might shift his support away from the Republican Party. Musk, however, has floated the idea of launching a third party representing “the 80% in the middle.”

Elon Musk has said he went “too far” with some of his recent social media posts targeting US President Donald Trump. The two traded threats and insults online last week, in a row that was widely viewed as an end of their “bromance.”

“I regret some of my posts about President Donald Trump last week. They went too far,” Musk said on his X account early on Wednesday morning.

Musk claims he sponsored Trump's run for a second term in the White House to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, which he insists was crucial for the Republican candidate's victory last November. After taking office, Trump appointed Musk to serve as head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked with slashing wasteful government expenditure.

In recent weeks, however, the tech entrepreneur has emerged as a vocal critic of Trump's so-called “big, beautiful bill” that requires Congressional approval to fund the president's second term policy priorities. Musk branded the proposal full of “pork” and claimed it reneged on the campaign promise to decrease the federal debt.

Trump claimed last week that Musk opposed the bill out of self-interest, which triggered a barrage of increasingly hostile posts between the pair. The president branded Musk “crazy,” while the tech billionaire alleged that Trump was complicit in the sex offenses of late financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Musk later deleted the post.

Musk did not specify which of his previous posts he now found regrettable. Media reports have suggested that his associates and the White House were engaged in backchannel communications in a bid to deflate the tensions. Trump publicly said he was not interested in direct contacts with Musk, but later appeared to tone down his rhetoric toward the entrepreneur.

Slovakia will not support the EU's new package of sanctions against Russia, Prime Minister Robert Fico has said. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Fico warned that the proposed restrictions from Brussels could plunge his country into an energy crisis.

The European Commission unveiled its 18th sanctions package targeting Russia on Tuesday, focusing on energy exports, infrastructure, and financial institutions. The measures, pitched as pressure on Moscow to end the Ukraine conflict, include lowering the price cap on Russian oil from $60 to $45 per barrel, banning future use of the damaged Nord Stream pipeline, restricting imports of refined products based on Russian crude, and sanctioning 77 vessels allegedly part of a Russian “shadow fleet,” which Brussels claims is used to circumvent oil trade bans. The package must be approved unanimously by all 27 EU member states to take effect.

“The Slovak Republic will not support the upcoming 18th sanctions package against the Russian Federation,” Fico wrote. He added that Bratislava could reconsider if Brussels offers “a real solution to the crisis” that Slovakia would face from losing Russian energy supplies.

Slovakia has implemented all EU sanctions on Russia since the Ukraine conflict escalated in 2022. However, Fico has consistently opposed the measures since returning to office in 2023, arguing they “are not working” and hurt EU member states more than they affect Moscow. Last week, the Slovak parliament passed a resolution prohibiting government representatives from supporting new international sanctions against Russia, citing economic harm to Slovakia's industry and population. While Slovak President Peter Pellegrini has the authority to veto the resolution, it is binding under Slovak law, requiring Fico to vote against the new sanctions in Brussels.

Russia has dismissed Western sanctions as illegitimate and counterproductive. President Vladimir Putin has said lifting sanctions is one of Moscow's conditions for settling the Ukraine conflict. Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) and a presidential investment envoy, stated that the EU's push for more sanctions is politically motivated and aimed at prolonging the conflict.

NEW YORK, June 11. /TASS/. The number of US troops deployed in the Californian city of Los Angeles currently exceeds that in Iraq and Syria, ABC News reports.

""There are 4,800 activated Guard and Marine personnel in LA, compared to the 2,500 troops in Iraq and 1,500 in Syria,"" the broadcaster points out.

Mass detentions of undocumented migrants began in Los Angeles on June 6. By the evening of June 7, at least 44 people were already held on suspicion of immigration violations. Citizens took to the streets in response to the raids, with protests escalating into riots.

WASHINGTON, June 11. /TASS/. Moscow has given to Washington the roadmap on return of the de-facto confiscated Russian diplomatic property in the United States, Russia's new Ambassador to Washington Alexander Darchiev said in an interview with TASS, the first one since the start of his tenure on March 26.

""As part of the permanent mechanism of regular consultations on bilateral 'irritants,' where I lead the Russian delegation, a negotiation process has been launched about the return of the six Russian diplomatic property sites, de-facto confiscated in 2016-2018,"" he said. ""The American side has been given a 'roadmap' with realistic timeframes and a demand to provide access to these sites for inspections and assessment of damage.""

In 2017, the Russian Consulate General in San Francisco, the trade mission in Washington (both state-owned) and its branch in New York (rented premises) were closed due to anti-Russian sanctions. In 2018, Washington announced the closure of the Russian Consulate General in Seattle (rented premises), as well as the residence of the Consul General (diplomatic property).

NEW YORK, June 11. /TASS/. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass did not rule out the possibility of imposing a curfew in the downtown area if protests continue.

""Now we're looking at things like curfews. We're looking at other aggressive response that we can have in case this violence breaks out again,"" she said at a news conference, aired by Associated Press.

She said the final decision is yet to be made. In her view, there was no need to impose the curfew in the entire city.

Mass detentions of undocumented migrants began in Los Angeles on June 6. By the evening of June 7, at least 44 people were already held on suspicion of immigration violations.

Greg Abbott says troops ‘on standby' in response to local police request ahead of planned protests this week

LA protests – live updates

The governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, has ordered the state's national guard to deploy to the city of San Antonio ahead of immigration-related protests planned for this week, saying the soldiers are “on standby”.

Abbott posted on social media early on Wednesday that the national guard “will be deployed to locations across the state to ensure peace & order. Peaceful protest is legal. Harming a person or property is illegal & will lead to arrest.”

The Texas national guard, he added, “will use every tool & strategy to help law enforcement maintain order”.

Abbott's move to mobilize troops follows Donald Trump's decision on Saturday to send the California national guard into Los Angeles after some limited and mostly peaceful protests against immigration raids. California leaders described the sending of the troops, and then 700 US marines, as a deliberate provocation.

Widespread demonstrations against the Trump administration's deportation raids are expected on Wednesday, according to local media reports, and on Saturday nationwide protests are planned as part of a “No Kings” event, according to organizers. Trump has planned a military parade in Washington for the same day and has threatened to treat any protesters harshly, despite the right to protest being enshrined in the US constitution.

Unlike in California, where neither the state governor not local civic leaders asked for military help – and where the state has sued to have them removed – in Texas the guard was reportedly sent after San Antonio law enforcement requested their assistance. According to the San Antonio Express News, the city police chief, William McManus, contacted state officials on Monday night seeking to confirm the presence of guardsmen in the city.

Abbott's press secretary, Andrew Mahaleris, later said that national guard soldiers “are on standby in areas where mass demonstrations are planned in case they are needed”.

“Peaceful protests are part of the fabric of our nation, but Texas will not tolerate the lawlessness we have seen in Los Angeles,” Mahaleris said in a statement on Tuesday night. “Anyone engaging in acts of violence or damaging property will be swiftly held accountable to the full extent of the law.”

A press conference is planned for Wednesday to discuss preparations for the protests in the city. On Sunday about 300 protesters had gathered in downtown San Antonio, some carrying flags and signs reading: “Abolish ICE,” “Power to the People,” and “Mexicans Ain't Going Anywhere.”

On Monday six demonstrators in Austin were arrested by officers with the Texas department of public safety after what the department called a “planned and well-publicized protest” near the state capitol. They have been charged with felony criminal mischief, resisting arrest and other offenses.

“Texas is a law-and-order state, and the department has zero tolerance for individuals disrupting public order or endangering law enforcement officers,” DPS said in a news release.

The “No Kings” protest planned for San Antonio on Saturday is being organized by the 50501 Movement, in coordination with the Bexar county Democratic party, the party for Socialism and Liberation, Indivisible and Women's March.

The protest, the organization said, will “culminate in an act of peaceful resistance”. The 50501 organization said on its website that it “stands in opposition to billionaire influence in government and advocates for the rights and empowerment of the working class”.

The Texas national guard is the largest of its kind in the US, with 22,000 soldiers and airmen. The governor serves as its commander, except when the president has mobilized the troops for federal duty.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Protesters defy overnight curfew as California governor issues searing rebuke of administration. Plus, who is behind the hedonistic party palaces of New York's Fire Island?

Good morning.

Los Angeles police have announced they are making “mass arrests” in the city's downtown area, as people gathered in defiance of an overnight curfew imposed after days of protests against Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and military deployment.

Late on Tuesday night local time, the Los Angeles police department (LAPD) wrote on X that “multiple groups” continued to congregate within the designated downtown curfew area.

“Those groups are being addressed and mass arrests are being initiated,” it said.

The mayor, Karen Bass, had announced a 10-hour curfew for a square-mile area of downtown, where demonstrations against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) have continued. The LA police department has said it had carried out more than 300 arrests of protesters in the last two days.

The city's crackdown came after Gavin Newsom, California's governor, filed an emergency request to block the Trump administration from using military forces to accompany Ice officers on raids throughout LA.

Trump has ordered the deployment of 4,000 national guard members and 700 marines to LA after days of protests driven by anger over aggressive Ice raids that have targeted garment workers, day laborers, car washes and immigrant communities across the US's second-largest city.

What has Newsom said? Trump's decision to deploy the national guard in LA was “a brazen abuse of power”, that has “inflamed a combustible situation”, Newsom said in a searing rebuke of the administration.

What about Trump? In an address to troops at the Fort Bragg military base in North Carolina yesterday, Trump spread conspiracy theories, maligned California's Democratic leaders and misleadingly portrayed protesters as part of a “foreign invasion”.

Hamas has killed 50 fighters in recent months from a Palestinian gang armed by Israel in Gaza, according to a statement released amid reports that Israeli troops directly intervened this week to protect the faction.

According to media reports in Israel, clashes between Hamas fighters and members of a militia led by Yasser abu Shabab, known locally for his involvement in criminal activity, erupted early Tuesday in Rafah.

The Israeli news channel i24 reported that Israeli soldiers had clashed with Hamas members in order to protect Abu Shabab from being killed, which resulted in deaths on both sides.

Were they really armed by Israel? Yes. Israeli defence officials acknowledged last week that they had been arming the group, with the aim of undermining Hamas. Aid workers said the group had a long history of looting from UN trucks.

Elon Musk has said he “regrets” some of his posts about Donald Trump, in an apparent attempt to patch up relations with the US president. In a post on X, Musk wrote: “I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far.”

The U-turn comes almost a week after the world's richest man launched a fierce attack on Trump, calling his “big, beautiful bill” a “disgusting abomination” and alleging that Trump was implicated in the Jeffrey Epstein files, a claim denied by Trump and by Epstein's former attorney. But Musk subsequently deleted the post and several others.

Did Musk explain his change of heart? No, but Tesla's share price sank last week, with a significant impact on Musk's wealth – knocking approximately $90bn off his fortune – and on Wednesday following his statement Tesla's shares were back up 2.5% in premarket trading.

Shares have risen in China as traders appear to welcome the trade framework agreed with the US in London last night, though negotiations to resolve the wider tariff war triggered by Trump in April will continue.

The US representative Mikie Sherrill won the Democratic primary in New Jersey's race for governor. The navy pilot and former prosecutor has been a vocal critic of Trump.

A Canadian man has defied the odds to win three more lottery jackpots between August and May, accumulating about $2.5m in prize money – after his first win a decade ago.

Over the last century, Fire Island Pines, as the central square-mile section of this sandy spit off the coast of Long Island in New York is known, has evolved into something of a queer Xanadu. Now counting about 600 homes, it is a place of mythic weekend-long parties and carnal pleasure, a byword for bacchanalia and fleshy hedonism – but also simply a secluded haven where people can be themselves.

Last year, a US company called Ebb Carbon announced the world's largest marine carbon removal deal to date, signing a multimillion-dollar agreement with Microsoft to try to help fix a very real problem: ocean acidification. The sector's growth – part of the larger carbon removal market – has been astronomic, and has started to ring alarm bells for many ocean scientists across the world.

A giant crane that has blighted the skyline of Florence for almost 20 years is to finally be removed. The controversial structure, described as “a metal monster”, has stood in the centre of the Tuscan capital since 2006. Over time, the crane not only became a target of mockery, with an Instagram account set up for the purpose, but also the ultimate symbol of Italy's notoriously sluggish bureaucracy.

Beatle wrote in 1962 letter to Cynthia Powell that he wished he was on his way to her flat with ‘chocies and a throbber'

John Lennon is considered by many to be a poet. But the Beatle revealed his more prosaic side in a letter penned in 1962 to his future wife Cynthia Powell, in which he declared: “I wish I was on the way to your flat with the Sunday papers and chocies and a throbber.”

The intimate missive, which includes a complaint about his bandmate Paul McCartney's snoring, is now being sold at auction by Christie's with a £30,000 to £40,000 estimate.

Written over five nights after concerts during their Hamburg residency in April 1962, Lennon, then aged 21, wrote: “I love love love you and I'm missing you like mad … I wish I was on the way to your flat with the Sunday papers and chocies and a throbber.

“I wonder why all the newspapers wrote about Stu … I haven't seen Astrid since the day we arrived I've thought of going to see her but I would be so awkward.

“Paul's leaping about on my head (he's in a bunk on top of me and he's snoring) … Shurrup Mcarntey [sic]!”

He then tells Cynthia he does not like the idea of McCartney's then girlfriend, Dot Rhone, moving in with her, saying: “We would never be alone really … imagine having her there all the time when we were in bed – and imagine Paul coming all the time.”

He adds: “I love you please wait for me and don't be sad and work hard be a clever little Cyn Powell.”

Lennon and Cynthia, who was a year older than him, had been in a relationship for four years, having met at Liverpool College of Art.

They married in August 1962 and their son, Julian, was born in April 1963, weeks after Beatlemania exploded with the release of their chart-topping first album, Please Please Me.

The couple divorced in 1968 and she later claimed he had inflicted physical abuse on her throughout their relationship, including slapping her face in a fit of jealousy.

The handwritten letter was sold by Cynthia to a Swedish collector in 1991 and changed hands to the Swedish vendor in 1993.

Thomas Venning, the head of books and manuscripts at Christie's, said: “There are some smutty and funny bits and you sense his personality on the page, unlike his later letters which are more guarded and preachy. It provides an early insight into the Beatles from their time in Hamburg which was so important to their development as a band.”

Lennon was murdered by Mark David Chapman in New York in 1980.

The sale takes place on 9 July.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Brazil on Tuesday booked their place at the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America with a lackluster 1-0 home victory over Paraguay, the first win of Carlo Ancelotti's reign, while in Asia, Australia qualified.

Five-time world champions Brazil punched their ticket to the finals in Canada, the US and Mexico thanks to Vinicius Jr.

It was the perfect gift for the Italian Ancelotti on his 66th birthday, having seen his new side held 0-0 by Ecuador last week in his first game as coach.

Former Real Madrid coach Ancelotti praised his team's “commitment” and “attitude.”

“It was a good match with a very good first half, although obviously we suffered a bit because Paraguay are very solid opponents and we slowed down a bit in the second,” he said.

Uruguay's 2-0 win over Venezuela in Montevideo had raised the prospect of qualification for both Brazil and Paraguay at Corinthians Arena.

Paraguay needed only a point to qualify, while Brazil knew they could advance with a win.

The victory lifted Brazil into third place in the South American standings with 25 points from 16 games, guaranteeing them a top-six finish and an automatic qualifying berth.

Looking ahead to next summer, Ancelotti said he had “a very long list” of 70 players in mind, including Neymar, who was missing with injury.

“I really liked those who were with me in this squad for their commitment, their attitude and the atmosphere,” he added.

The defeat left Paraguay with 24 points, meaning they need one point to secure their first World Cup appearance since 2010.

Surprise package Ecuador joined Brazil by sealing qualification with a point following a 0-0 draw with Peru in Lima.

In other games, Uruguay edged closer to qualification with their win over Venezuela, while Chile were eliminated with defeat to Bolivia. Argentina, who have already qualified, came from behind to frustrate Colombia with a 1-1 draw in Buenos Aires.

In Asia, Tony Popovic's Socceroos, who went into the third round's final match day heavy favorites to progress, defeated direct rivals Saudi Arabia 2-1 in Jeddah to seal the second automatic qualification spot in Group C, and Australia's sixth successive appearance at a World Cup.

Saudi Arabia must instead make do with a place in the fourth round, alongside Indonesia. Japan had already secured top place in the group.

“We've built a good foundation now and we want to really get better, kick on and try and do something special at the World Cup,” Popovic said.

In Group B, Oman ended Palestine's hopes of a first appearance at the finals with a last-gasp draw.

Palestinian hearts were broken when they conceded a penalty deep into stoppage-time to draw 1-1 with Oman in Amman.

The result means Oman finish fourth in the group at Palestine's expense and therefore advance to the next phase of qualification.

Crystal Palace forward Daichi Kamada scored twice for Japan and Paris Saint-Germain's Lee Kang-in netted for South Korea as the Asian giants rounded off successful World Cup qualifying campaigns in style.

Japan romped to a 6-0 thrashing of Patrick Kluivert's Indonesia in Osaka, while South Korea cruised to a 4-0 win over Kuwait in Seoul, where fans were treated to a late appearance by Son Heung-min.

Iran and Uzbekistan are already through to next year's finals from Group A, as are Jordan and South Korea from Group B, who both secured qualification last week with a game to spare.

Iraq confirmed third place in the group with a 1-0 victory against Jordan in Amman, the hosts having already clinched a first appearance at the World Cup.

Yamal bagged a brace, while Williams scored and provided an assist as the two wingers cut France's makeshift defense to ribbons.

Defense spending hiked

The government on Tuesday hiked defense spending by 20 percent following last month's deadly conflict with India. The government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced the increase as part of the budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026, in which overall spending would be cut by 7 percent to 17.57 trillion rupees (US$62.3 billion). Minister of Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb said that the government was allocating 2.55 trillion rupees for defense compared with 2.12 trillion rupees in the previous budget.

People protest government

About 15,000 people protested in a square in Budapest on Tuesday in what organizers called the beginning of a resistance movement against the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Nearly two dozen public figures, including writers, actors, musicians and journalists, joined the demonstration. Most of the speakers criticized what they see as the government's increasingly anti-democratic conduct. Some alleged corruption benefiting those with ties to Orban's Fidesz party. “This country doesn't belong to those who lie, who rob from the people, who have sold their humanity for power,” said Csaba Bogos, one of the speakers. “This country belongs to those who dare to think, who can read between the lines, who trust in themselves and each other, and believe that there is a common, peaceful future that we must build together.”

Jobless data defended

Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke defended the methodology of his organization's unemployment data after Capitec Bank Holdings chief executive officer Gerrie Fourie said that misclassification of traders means the jobless rate was much lower. Fourie said that the unemployment rate — which was 32.9 percent for the first quarter — would be closer to 10 percent if self-employed people and those working in informal markets are counted, Business Day reported. In a letter to the newspaper, Maluleke said it was “incorrect and misleading to suggest” that Statistics South Africa misses those employed in the informal sector. “The informal sector is measured, tracked and reported on consistently, and if anything the insights these reports provide should guide and enrich policy, not distort it,” Maluleke said. “We urge industry leaders to engage more deeply with official statistics before questioning their validity,” he said. “While constructive debate is encouraged, it should be based on solid evidence.” The organization measures casual workers using International Labour Organization guidelines on registration status and sizes of businesses, and that to qualify, employees must be unregistered for income tax and work in places that employ fewer than five people.

Musk apologizes over posts

Elon Musk on Wednesday wrote on X that he regrets some of the posts he made last week about President Donald Trump. “I regret some of my posts about President Donald Trump last week. They went too far,” Musk wrote. Trump and Musk began exchanging insults last week on social media, with the chief executive officer of Tesla and SpaceX describing the president's proposed sweeping tax and spending bill as a “disgusting abomination.”

A Beijing auction house on Tuesday sold a human-sized Labubu figure for 1.08 million yuan (US$150,260), setting a new record for the “blind box” toy as it moves from craze to collectible.

The event held by Yongle International Auction, which traditionally specializes in modern art as well as jewelry, marked the first-ever auction dedicated to Labubu, toothy monster figurines that are mainly sold by Chinese toy company Pop Mart and have been at the center of a global frenzy for the past year.

The auction offered 48 lots for sale and was attended in person by about 200 people, while more than 1,000 bidders put down offers via Yongle's mobile app, the auction house said.

The starting price for all the items was zero, while the lots sold for a combined 3.73 million yuan.

The highest grossing item, a mint green, 1.31m-tall Labubu figure, received several bids to sell for 1.08 million yuan.

The auctioneer said it was the only one available in the world.

A set of three Labubu sculptures, about 40cm tall and made of PVC material, sold for 510,000 yuan.

The set, from a series called “Three Wise Labubu,” was limited to a run of 120 sets in 2017 and another one sold for HK$203,200 (US$25,888) at Sotheby's most recent auction in Hong Kong.

Labubu was created a decade ago by Hong Kong artist and illustrator Kasing Lung (龍家昇). In 2019, Lung agreed to let them be sold by Pop Mart, which markets collectable figurines often sold in “blind boxes.”

A buyer of a blind box toy does not know exactly what design they will receive until they open it.

The starting price for Labubu blind box toys sold in Pop Mart's stores is about 50 yuan.

The character's popularity skyrocketed after Lisa of the South Korean pop music group Blackpink was spotted with a Labubu, and praised the doll in interviews and online posts.

Many celebrities followed. In May, British soccer star David Beckham shared a photograph on Instagram of his Labubu attached to a bag.

20,000 people
      chose to be part of the Kyiv Independent community —  thank you.
    

A neighborhood in Springfield, Oregon, on June 10 renamed a local street from ""Kiev"" to ""Kyiv"" — a move initiated by members of the Kyiv Independent's global community.

Photos shared with the Kyiv Independent show the newly installed blue-and-yellow street sign, reflecting both the correct Ukrainian transliteration and the national colors of Ukraine. 

The change comes amid a broader effort by Ukraine and its allies worldwide to move away from Russian-derived place names and honor Ukraine's linguistic and political independence.

""We're very proud of our city (Springfield, OR, U.S.) for supporting our efforts to make this happen,"" one community member told the Kyiv Independent. 

The spelling ""Kiev,"" pronounced ""kee-yev,"" is the Russian version of Ukraine's capital. ""Kyiv"" (pronounced ""keev"") is the correct Ukrainian form, based on the native pronunciation and Latin transliteration.

For decades, global usage favored Russian-based spellings, a legacy of the Soviet Union's dominance and the widespread misconception that Ukrainian cities and culture were merely extensions of Russia. Even after Ukraine declared independence in 1991, much of the international community continued using names like Kiev, Lvov, and Odessa — all Russified versions.

That began to change after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and its war in eastern Ukraine. The full-scale invasion in 2022 accelerated the shift, prompting governments, media outlets, and advocacy groups to adopt Ukrainian transliterations such as Kyiv, Lviv, and Odesa.

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has promoted the change through campaigns like #KyivNotKiev, arguing that the use of correct names respects Ukraine's sovereignty and resists Russian imperial narratives.

Russian leaders, including President Vladimir Putin, have long emphasized historical ties to Kyiv in their justification for expansionist policies. Renaming streets and using correct spellings is one way communities abroad are pushing back.


          We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.
        


          More than 20,000 people chose to stand behind us. We're deeply grateful and overwhelmed with your support. Thank you for making it possible.

Summer McIntosh at the World Short Course Swimming Championships in Budapest, Hungary, in 2024.Denes Erdos/The Associated Press

Summer McIntosh came within a blink of an eye of breaking swimming's oldest women's world record at the Bell Canadian Swimming Trials on Tuesday night.

With a sold-out crowd's cheers ringing in her ears, the 18-year-old from Toronto swam the 200-metre butterfly in 2:02.26 – just .45 off the record of 2:01.81 set by China's Liu Zige in 2009. She also shaved .76 off her own Canadian record and notched the second fastest time in history in the event.

Meanwhile, four new swimmers earned selection to Team Canada for this summer's World Aquatics Championships. 

McIntosh was pleased with her swim but also believes the record remains within her grasp.

“I think this world record is the hardest one to get,” said McIntosh, who has set two world records and four Canadian records in four days. “I'm just so happy with the 2:02 low tonight. I didn't know if that was possible for me.”

McIntosh was on world record pace when she made the final turn for home.

“I was kind of upset with myself with the finish,” she said. “My last stroke was just a little bit wonky. I can definitely find the other little deficiencies through the race.

“The fact I'm knocking on the door on that world record is really encouraging. That's the one world record I never thought I would even come close to. To be pretty close to it is pretty wild.”

The two sides of Summer McIntosh, Canada's gold-medal talent

McIntosh won the 200-m individual medley on Monday in 2:05.70, lowering the time of 2:06.12 set by Hungary's Katinka Hosszu that stood for nearly 10 years. She opened the trials winning the 400-m freestyle in 3:54.18 Saturday, breaking the old mark of 3:55.38 held by Australia's Ariarne Titmus.

She broke her own Canadian record in the 800-m freestyle Sunday. Her time of 8:05.07 shaved almost five seconds off her own Canadian record and was the third fastest time ever, 0.95 of a second off the world record American legend Katie Ledecky set in May.

Ilya Kharun of Montreal picked up his second victory of the trials, winning the men's 200-m butterfly in 1:53.41.

Kharun earned a bronze medal in the 200 fly at the Paris 2024 Olympics, setting a Canadian record time. It was the first medal ever for a Canadian in the event.

Kharun said the race remains a learning curve for him.

“I'm really glad how it's progressing,” said Kharun, who swam a personal best time to win the 100 fly on Sunday. “I think it should be a lot better once we get some more work in.”

It was an emotional moment for Toronto's Ruslan Gaziev who won the men's 100-m freestyle in 48.37 seconds. That was under Swimming Canada's secondary standard of 48.82.

Gaziev is returning to swimming after serving an 18-month suspension due to an anti-doping rule violation regarding keeping his whereabouts information fully up-to-date.

“I'm just happy I won,” said the 25-year-old. “I'm honestly proud of myself and how I've handled the struggles I've had. I feel like I've really built up my resilience.”

Antoine Sauve of Montreal's CAMO club was second in the men's 100 in 48.42. Toronto's Josh Liendo was third in 48.62 followed by Filip Senc-Samardzic of Toronto in 49.13. Liendo had already earned selection in two events (100 fly and 50 free) while Sauve and Senc-Samardzic added their names to the list.

Three-time Olympian Penny Oleksiak of Toronto won her second event of the trials, taking the women's 100 free in 54.03, well under the AQUA A standard of 54.25. She swam a personal best to win the 50 free on Monday.

“I think I had a lot more in that race,” said Oleksiak, the owner of seven Olympic medals. “I'm excited to get back into training and just getting faster for the summer.”

The top four finishers in the men's and women's 100 freestyle events will be selected to join Team Canada at this summer's World Aquatics Championships. 

Finishing second in the women's 100 free was Kelowna's Taylor Ruck in 54.41, followed by Brooklyn Douthwright of Riverview, N.B., in 54.74 and Ingrid Wilm of the High Performance Centre—Vancouver in 55.15. Ruck (100-m) and Wilm (50-m) had already earned selection in backstroke events, while Douthwright earned her spot for the first time.

Para swimmers enjoyed another strong night with Alyssa Smyth, Nicholas Bennett and Sebastian Massabie all setting Canadian records. Katie Cosgriffe won the multi-class women's 100-m butterfly in 1:07.61, a time the S10 swimmer from the Oakville Aquatic Club believes she can improve on.

“There's lots of technical ways that I can be a lot faster,” she said. “I have to work on my speed in general.”

Alyssa Smyth of the Orangeville Otters Swim Club was second in the race in an S13 Canadian record time of 1:06.42.

A mix-up resulted in Smyth arriving at the pool late. She didn't have time for a warm-up before her race.

“There was a lot of adrenalin,” said Smyth. “I thought to make the best of the situation I would just try the best I could. It went pretty well.” Fernando Lu of Langley's Olympian Swimming won two races. The S10 swimmer started the evening taking the multi-class 100-m butterfly in 58.20 seconds then the 50-m freestyle in 24.44.

“It went well for me tonight,” said Lu who reached two finals at the Paris 2024 Paralympics. “I feel more energized than ever. I'm really happy with the way I've recovered from the past races.”

Massabie of the Pacific Sea Wolves broke the S5 Canadian record twice in the 50 freestyle. He swam 36.22 seconds in the morning preliminaries then 35.42 in the final. He broke the Canadian record in the S5 50-m butterfly twice on Monday.

Nicholas Bennett, an S14 swimmer with the Red Deer Catalina Swim Club, swam 57.50 to lower his own Canadian record in the 100-m butterfly.

The six-day trials, which run through Thursday, have attracted more than 700 swimmers to Saanich Commonwealth Place in Victoria.

When discussing caregiving challenges with your manager, come with solutions, not just problems to be solved.GETTY IMAGES

Question: I have two young children and I'm having difficulty balancing work and family. My partner and I both work in demanding jobs, and between scrambling to pick them up from daycare and their frequent illnesses, we are both running ragged. I am ambitious and I want to advance – how can I progress in my career at this time in my life? 

We asked Marlene Lenarduzzi, chief risk officer at EQ Bank, to tackle this one: 

I know the feeling. I have three adult children, and my husband and I both had demanding careers early on. When my kids were little, I remember older women saying to me, ‘Enjoy it. It goes by so fast.' But when you're in the middle of it, it can't go by fast enough, because it really is hard. So, first off, be kind to yourself. Acknowledge that yes, this is hard, and this too shall pass. 

Next, ask for help. Use your network, your family, your friends. And don't be afraid to ask your kids to lend a hand with chores. You'll be surprised at how much they can do. Mornings are busy; everyone's trying to get up, get fed, get dressed, get out the door on time. I kept the cereal bowls, the milk and the cereal at a low level, so the kids could make their own breakfast from when they were four or five years old. It teaches them good life skills and builds their character. 

When it comes to discussing challenges with your manager, you want to be known as someone who can deliver results and come up with solutions. If you're coming to them saying, ‘I have this problem, what are you going to do about it?' That doesn't work well. But if you are coming to them saying, ‘This is how I'm going manage this time in my life,' that will go a lot further. 

So, if you need to drop your children at daycare in the morning and it's hard to get in to work before 9:00 a.m., come up with a solution that says: I will start work at nine. I will leave at 4:00 p.m. because I want to pick my children up from their after-school program. But I will log in at 9:00 p.m. once they're in bed to catch up on what I missed. If you have a reputation for coming to work with great attitude and delivering results, your manager isn't going to care that you aren't available for 8:00 a.m. meetings. I also felt that once I had children, I became hyper-efficient when I was at work. I didn't waste a lot of time. 

But I do want to say that it's also important to cut ourselves some slack and recognize that we are human. You shouldn't feel guilty about the time that you need to be with your kids, either because they're sick or you want to attend a school assembly. That's so important too. 

If you want to get ahead, don't forget your network. Make time for those connections. I know it can be challenging to have a drink with colleagues after work if you need to get your kids from daycare, but maybe you can find a lunch or a coffee in the morning to meet with people in your network. You'll find that a lot of people are in the same boat. I'm hearing just as many men saying, ‘I have to leave early today because I'm taking my son or daughter to hockey practice,' or something like that. I think there's much more flexibility and understanding for different ways of connecting. 

These women are leading in male-dominated industries – and they're hiring all-women teams

Annastacia Plaskos runs Fix It Females, a home renovation business that does everything from house painting to drywalling to building. The business rapidly grew from three to nearly 40 employees within a few years – all of them women. 

Hiring only female workers was intentional for Ms. Plaskos, who grew tired of having to prove herself to the male tradespeople she was working with, along with experiencing sexism and pay disparities in the industry. 

“For me, showing other women you can do this, that it is possible [is important],” she says. “You can make the same amount of money that a male can in this industry. It is doable.” 

Protect the sacred space of leisure from being contaminated by work 

Gloria Mark, a leading researcher on attention and distraction and University of California informatics professor, warns us to beware of leisure contamination: The tendency while taking a break to still be wrestling with work and family responsibilities. It's a mental spillover of stress into those rare moments that are meant to be restful. 

“Psychological detachment – fully detaching from stressors during leisure time – is crucial for recovery from stress. But achieving it in our always-connected, always-on, busy culture is getting harder and harder to do,” she writes on her Substack blog.

Feeling stuck in your job? How being the ‘CEO of your career' can help you get that promotion 

“Be explicit about what your goals and aspirations are. Don't assume that your manager or your organization knows what you want,” says Liz Samson, head of industry relations and operations at Square Canada. 

“Come to that conversation prepared with a list of accomplishments and their impact. It shows that you're being proactive and makes your manager's job easier. Share that list in advance to give your manager time to reflect on it. Being proactive and humble and actively asking for feedback really demonstrates a growth mindset.”

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed off on a recommendation to the Treasury Department last month to open an investigation into Harvard University, a report says.Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is pushing to investigate whether Harvard University violated federal sanctions, The New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by the newspaper.

Rubio is pushing to investigate if Harvard violated sanctions by collaborating on a health insurance conference in China that may have included officials blacklisted by the U.S., the paper said.

The university has been conducting an internal review into the involvement of the Chinese state-run group Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps at the conference, the paper added.

Rubio signed off on a recommendation to the Treasury Department last month to open an investigation, the report said.

Analysis: Harvard versus Trump is the new battle for independence

Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.

A Treasury Department spokesman said the agency takes “any allegations of sanctions violations extremely seriously” but declined to comment on possible or pending investigations. A State Department spokesperson also declined to comment.

A Harvard spokesman declined to comment to the New York Times. Harvard University did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The Trump administration has launched a multipronged attack on the country's oldest and wealthiest university, freezing billions of dollars in grants and other funding and proposing to end its tax-exempt status, prompting a series of legal challenges.

With all members completing their mandatory service this month, BTS is expected to reunite in 2025 — a comeback predicted to make a major global impact on streaming, sales, and concerts.

Deafening cheers and joyful screams of thousands of fans greeted K-pop group BTS members Jimin and Jung Kook who were discharged from South Korea's military on Wednesday.

This is another step toward the group's long-awaited reunion.

""Thank you so much for waiting for us,"" Jung Kook told fans, promising an ""even better version"" of BTS ahead.

The pair are the latest members of the seven-man group to complete the country's mandatory military service.

Jin, J-Hope finished their service in 2023, and RM and V returned to civilian life just a day before Jimin and Jung Kook. 

The last member SUGA, who is working as a social service agent, an alternative form of military service, is set for discharge on June 21.

Crowds gathering near military bases to catch a glimpse of the stars were so large that mobile networks briefly crashed, and satellite feeds faced interruptions.

Fans travelled hundreds of miles across the globe to see their idols.

""I think I'm gonna cry,"" Anaisa Silva, 30, from Portugal, told AFP news agency, while 64-year-old Rosie Tanquilut from the Philippines said, ""We couldn't sleep! We've been counting the days since they entered [the] military.""

The group, which went on hiatus in 2022 to fulfill their military duties, is expected to reunite in 2025.

All seven members signed renewed contracts with their agency HYBE in 2023, and industry analysts predict their comeback will spark a major wave in global music sales and concerts.

Before their hiatus, BTS generated more than $4 billion (€3.5 billion) annually in revenue, roughly 0.2% of South Korea's total GDP, according to official data.

Analysts are expecting BTS' comeback to make a major global impact across streaming, sales, and concerts.

Celebrations have already begun in Seoul, where fans are gathering for the group's 12th anniversary on Friday as banners proclaimed — ""WE ARE BACK.""

The US military is urging African countries to be more responsible for their own security as the Trump administration focuses on domestic policies. Could the move fuel militant groups and undo counterterrorism progress?

Africa should take greater ownership of its own security challenges. That was the message recently communicated by General Michael Langley, head of US Africa Command (USAFRICOM). The unit is part of the US Department of Defense and is responsible for all defense operations and security cooperation on the African continent. 

The announcement comes as the United States rethinks its military strategy in Africa, signaling a significant shift in its approach to security on the continent.

This adjustment aligns with a broader strategic pivot under the Trump administration, which is prioritizing homeland security and a leaner, more lethal military force, while reducing the US military footprint overseas, including in Africa.

But what could it mean for the continent?

With its growing population and vast natural resources, Africa is strategically important to Europe and the United States.

""Africa is a strategic partner with a large and growing youth population — projected to double by 2045 according to the African Economic Outlook,"" Adib Saani, a foreign policy and security analyst, told DW. ""The continent is rich, holding vast mineral resources and strategic reserves like uranium that both Western and Eastern countries heavily rely on."" The continent was also home to 11 of the world's 20 fastest-growing economies in 2024.

""The US and others engage with Africa not just out of goodwill but because these resources are vital for running industries worldwide,"" Saani said. ""This makes the relationship mutually beneficial — a win-win for Africa and the rest of the world.""

However, the Trump administration's defense strategy has shifted focus away from protecting the US from threats emanating from abroad, including countering terrorist organizations such as the so-called ""Islamic State"" (IS) militant group and al-Qaeda, which have expanded their presence and capabilities in Africa.

Previously, US military efforts in Africa combined defense, diplomacy and development.

""America has been a close partner in countering violent extremism, especially in Eastern and West Africa,"" Saani explained. ""We have relied heavily on US logistics, training and intelligence sharing to address these threats. In terms of human security, the US has also contributed through USAID and other programs that have helped lift many out of poverty.""

USAFRICOM head Langley said the military's priorities now focus on homeland protection, encouraging instead ""burden sharing"" with African partners. He said the goal is to build local military capacity to enable independent operations and reduce reliance on US forces.

This shift was evident during the latest African Lion joint military exercise. The annual event is the largest military exercise on the continent and emphasizes combined air, land and sea operations with more than 40 participating nations. The latest edition, in May, lacked the US-led efforts usually apparent and instead focused on collaboration and cooperation. 

Yet foreign policy analyst Adib Saani warned that a diminished US presence could create a power vacuum, emboldening militant networks and undermining years of counterterrorism efforts.

""If the US withdraws its support, it would hit us hard. It could embolden terrorists to carry out more lethal and audacious attacks, knowing there is no major power backing our fight. This would also dampen the morale of our soldiers who face these threats daily, and place significant economic pressure on affected countries,"" he said.

USAFRICOM currently deploys roughly 6,500 personnel across Africa and has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in security assistance. Without that, Saani worries that Africa will not be able to be fully independent in terms of security.

""It will be difficult in terms of logistics and technology — we are simply not there yet. Security is a shared responsibility and works best when it involves multiple actors. In my opinion, Africa cannot do it alone.""

African countries will need to look for other allies — both new and old, say experts. China has already launched extensive military training programs for African forces, replicating aspects of the US military model, while Russian mercenaries have established themselves as key security partners in North, West and Central Africa.

""China's approach in the past has mainly been economic,"" Saani explained. The US, he pointed out, has primarily focused on military support, in addition to providing economic help. ""The Russians have strong presence with both economic and military involvement. It feels like everyone is competing for attention. The clear message is that there's a need to diversify partnerships. We can't rely solely on the US; we may also need to engage more with the Russians and others.""

Some voices say the lack of US support could be a wake-up call for African countries, forcing them to consider their own resources and rise to the challenge.

African nations must now take the opportunity to review their security resources, Saani said, and collaborate more closely. 

""Building up our defense industry is also critical. This means developing industrial capacity and enhancing the capabilities of our armed forces,"" he added.

""We also need to tackle corruption to ensure that funds are not getting lost in people's pockets but are instead used to improve people's lives.""

The US under President Donald Trump is losing popularity in a number of countries, a new study shows. But opinions on him and the country vary widely, in particular depending on ideological alignment.

The United States is seeing a marked drop in popularity in many countries during the second term of President Donald Trump, according to a study by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center released on Wednesday.

The survey, carried out in 24 countries, showed overall ratings of the US falling in 15 countries since last spring, with Mexico, Sweden, Poland and Canada displaying the biggest increase in negative views.

Respondents were asked about overall views on the US and the state of its democracy as well as about their opinion of Trump, both with regard to his personal traits and his ability to handle major global issues.

Most of the interviews were conducted after the notorious meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 28 and before Trump announced tariffs on countries around the world on April 2.

Mexico and Sweden were the two countries where the opinion of the US suffered most, with drops of 32 percentage points in positive ratings (from 61% to 29%) in the first and 28 percentage points (47% to 19%) in the second in comparison with 2024.

US popularity among adults in Poland and Canada fell by more than 20 percentage points over the year in both countries.

The fall in US popularity in Germany was also marked: from 49% to 33% (16 percentage points).

Opinions about the US in the UK, Greece, Hungary, South Africa, Argentina and India showed little change.

People in three countries — Israel, Nigeria and Turkey — became slightly more likely to give the US good marks.

Israel was the country with the highest percentage (83%) of people with a positive assessment of the US. 

Sweden had the most people who view the US unfavorably (79%).

Despite the increase in popularity in Turkey, the country still has one of the most unfavorable opinions of the US, with just 25% of adults having a positive view of the country.

In Germany, 66% had a negative view of the US.

Younger people (35 and below) in most countries surveyed had a more positive view of the US than those aged 50 and above.

This was particularly noticeable in Brazil, with 73% of younger adults giving a positive assessment compared with 37% of older adults who have an unfavorable view.

Political ideologies also played a large role in peoples' opinions.

Among the 51% of people in Israel who say they are ideologically rightist, 97% had a favorable view of the US.

Australia also displayed a wide gap between those on the right, of whom 60% viewed the US positively, and those on the left, where the number dwindled to 12%.

In Germany, supporters of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party were far more likely to have positive opinions of the US (63%) than those who do not back the party (25%).

The US president received mostly negative ratings in the survey, with more than half of adults in 19 of the countries saying they had little or no confidence in Trump's ability to lead world affairs.

This is despite the fact that majorities in 18 countries viewed him as a ""strong leader.""

The survey showed that a median of 34% of adults have a lot or some confidence in Trump's ability to give good leadership in world affairs, while 62%) have little or no confidence in him.

His highest ratings came from Nigeria (79% confidence), Israel (69%), Kenya (64%), Hungary (53%) and India (52%). 

Adults in Mexico had the least confidence (8%), followed by Sweden (15%), Turkey (16%), Germany (18%) and Spain (19%).

In 17 countries, men have more confidence in Trump than women, with this difference most marked in Sweden, Poland, and the UK. In Germany, the gender gap was 11 percentage points.

Those on the right of the political spectrum also see him more positively. 

In all, 13 nations gave lower ratings for Trump than they did for his predecessor, Joe Biden, in 2024, but they are higher in six countries.

Trump received his lowest marks on climate change policy, with a median of just 21% of people of the opinion that he can handle the challenges posed by global warming.

Just 33% thought he could resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and 29% the ""conflicts between Israel and its neighbors.""

“Paid insurrectionists” are behind the rioting in Los Angeles, Donald Trump claimed on Tuesday as another day of violence prompted officials to make it illegal to enter the city centre at night.

The US president alleged that well-equipped “agitators” had been paid to cause chaos in the country's second-biggest city, although he did not specify who was funding them or why.

He added that the 2,000 National Guard members and 700 US marines he had deployed to Los Angeles would remain in place until he decided it was safe.

Mr Trump's intervention came on the fourth day of protests sparked by immigration raids, during which cars have been set alight and properties vandalised in downtown LA. Demonstrators – and journalists lawfully covering the protests – have been tear-gassed and shot by police with rubber bullets.

Violence and looting has has become such a concern that on Tuesday night Karen Bass, the mayor, announced that people would be banned from the city centre from 8pm until 6am local time.

Ms Bass said that an emergency had been declared and that a curfew was necessary to protect locals and businesses.

“Last night, there were 23 businesses that were looted and I think if you drive through down-town LA, the graffiti is everywhere and has caused significant damages to businesses and a number of properties,” she said.

“Law enforcement will arrest individuals who break the curfew and you will be prosecuted.”

Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Trump described protesters as “insurrectionists”. Use of that term opens the door to the president invoking the 1807 Insurrection Act, which would give deployed troops the power to arrest protesters.

Currently, their role is limited to supporting police rather than directly participating in law enforcement.

“These are paid insurrectionists. These are paid troublemakers. They're agitators. They're paid,” Mr Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

“Do you think somebody walks up to a kerb and starts hammering pieces out, has all the equipment necessary and starts handing it out to people to use as a weapon? These are paid insurrectionists or agitators or troublemakers.”

Mr Trump added that the National Guard would remain in Los Angeles “until there's no danger”.

“It's common sense... when there's no danger they'll leave. You would have had a horrible situation unless I sent them,” he said. “You'd be reporting on a lot of death and a lot of destruction.”

Mr Trump's decision to bypass Gavin Newsom by unilaterally deploying the National Guard has prompted a power struggle with the California governor.

On Tuesday, Mr Newsom said he had filed an emergency motion to block the president's “illegal deployment” of troops in Los Angeles.

“Trump is turning the US military against American citizens. The courts must immediately block these illegal actions,” he said on social media.

Mr Trump had claimed to have spoken with Mr Newsom to tell him to “do a better job” – but that was swiftly denied by the governor.

“There was no call. Not even a voicemail,” he said. “Americans should be alarmed that a president deploying marines on to our streets doesn't even know who he's talking to.”

Mr Trump subsequently accused Mr Newsom of lying and provided Fox News with “evidence” in the form of a call log. However, it showed the pair spoke for 16 minutes in the early hours of June 7, rather than June 9 as the president claimed.

Meanwhile, John Fetterman, the Democrat senator for Pennsylvania, has criticised his party for failing to call out “anarchy and true chaos”, which have seen cars torches and shops looted.

“My party loses the moral high ground when we refuse to condemn setting cars on fire, destroying buildings, and assaulting law enforcement,” he said.

White House sources have said they view the riots as a political opportunity that would put the Democrats on the side of protesters and against the views of the majority of Americans.

“We couldn't script this any better... Democrats are again on the ‘20' side of an 80-20 issue,” a person close to the administration told Politico.

“We're happy to have this fight,” a White House official quoted by NBC News said.

A Trump adviser said the government's response was “what America voted for” in last year's election, adding: “This is the America First focus that got the president elected and is driven by nothing else than what he promised American voters.”

Tensions have flared elsewhere in the US, with protesters clashing with law enforcement and being arrested in Dallas and Austin at rallies against immigration and customs enforcement (ICE).

Mr Trump is also using the opportunity to push his “one big, beautiful” tax-and-spend Bill through the Senate, Axios reported.

Republican senators are apparently being told by the president they need to pass the legislation, which is facing an uncertain passage through Congress, to release federal funds for immigration enforcement.

“It's the best BBB [big beautiful bill] marketing ever. It has brought the critical nature of increased border funding and immigration enforcement to the fore,” said Andrew Kolvet, a spokesman for conservative group Turning Point USA.

He added: “Everyone we're talking to in the Senate says this put it over the top.”

Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff and the architect of Mr Trump's immigration policy, reportedly greenlit the raids on workplaces that sparked the Los Angeles riots.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Mr Miller instructed ICE officers to shift the focus from foreign criminals and “go out there and arrest illegal aliens”, to fulfil the president's campaign pledge for mass deportations.

He reportedly directed agents to target Home Depot and 7-Eleven convenience stores, asking for a show of hands and asking: “Who here thinks they can do it?”

Officers subsequently raided a Home Depot on Friday in the Westlake neighbourhood of Los Angeles, helping set off days of protests.

Jason Carroll, a CNN reporter reporting on the unrest on the streets of LA, was led away by officers on Monday night with his hands held behind his back, even though he apparently identified himself as a journalist.

“I'm being detained… I'm not being arrested, correct officers?” he could be heard saying, as he was taken outside a security perimeter.

Mr Carroll, who appears to have been detained for under 30 seconds, said the incident was unusual because police normally “realise that the press is there doing a job”.

“You take a lot of risks as press – this is low on that sort of scale of risks. But it is something that I wasn‘t expecting, simply because we've been out here all day,” he said.

CNN said two of its security personnel were also briefly detained by the police before being released without charge.

Several journalists were shot by officers using non-lethal rounds as they covered the protests in the last few days, including Nick Stern, a British photographer, The New York Post's Toby Canham, Lauren Tomasi, an Australian TV reporter, and The Telegraph's Jon Putman.

Anthony Albanese, the Australian prime minister, described Ms Tomasi's experience as “horrific” and said he had raised the issue with the US government.

All foreign assistance programs will be managed by the State Department.

A cable from the U.S. State Department Tuesday showed that the Trump administration is eliminating the entire international workforce of the foreign aid agency that has provided lifesaving assistance in the Global South for over six decades.

“The Department of State is streamlining procedures under National Security Decision Directive 38 to abolish all USAID overseas positions,” read the cable, referring to the U.S. Agency for International Development. The document was obtained by The Guardian.

USAID was one of the first targets of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), whose former leader, billionaire Elon Musk, has baselessly called the agency a “criminal organization.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in March that 5,200 of the agency's 6,200 international initiatives had been eliminated and that the few remaining programs were now under the control of the State Department.

The announcement by Rubio on Tuesday means all foreign assistance programs will be managed by the department, with the administration firing hundreds of foreign service officers, contractors, and local employees across more than 100 countries.

USAID officials and international humanitarian experts have warned since the Trump administration first moved to freeze foreign assistance in January that cuts to the agency would leave at least 1 million children without treatment for malnutrition, leave 200,000 more children paralyzed from vaccine-preventable polio over next decade, and cause up to 160,000 deaths from malaria.

But President Donald Trump has persistently claimed the agency is “run by a bunch of radical lunatics” and Rubio has said USAID operates “independent of the national interest.”

“Everything they do has to be aligned with U.S. foreign policy,” said Rubio earlier this year.

The announcement of the elimination of USAID's entire workforce came as government watchdog Public Citizen released a new report on Trump's stop-work order affecting the agency in January. The order “likely affected 32 USAID-funded clinical trials conducted across 25 countries and as many as 94 thousand participants.”

According to the report:

Due to the stop-work order, said Nina Zeldes, a health researcher at Public Citizen's Health Research Group, “researchers were unable to safeguard the welfare of participants and uphold their ethical obligations.”

Public Citizen said that “the sudden, medically uncalled-for suspension of the clinical trials was a serious violation of research ethics, potentially jeopardizing the health of trial participants and the integrity of the trials.”

The Center for Global Development also published an analysis Tuesday of estimates that have stated the White House's proposal of cutting global health and humanitarian aid funding by two-thirds would put 1 million lives at risk.

Researchers Charles Kenny and Justin Sandefur found that it was “implausible” that cuts to U.S. foreign assistance would only impact so-called “waste” and would preserve lifesaving assistance, as the administration has claimed.

“Using our estimates of costs per life saved for U.S. global health and humanitarian assistance based on available empirical evidence, we can calculate the potential number of lives at risk from such cuts,” wrote Kenny and Sandefur. “The calculation suggests the cuts could lead to 675,000 additional deaths from HIV, and a combined 285,000 deaths from malaria and tuberculosis.”

Since assuming office, U.S. President Donald Trump has overseen an unprecedented assault on the federal government. Initially, his agent in this campaign was the tech mogul Elon Musk, who was running the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk described DOGE's mission as reducing the United States' $36 trillion in federal debt and ending the “tyranny of bureaucracy.” After a very public rift between the billionaires last week, Musk is on the outs with Trump, but the goal of downsizing the federal bureaucracy remains deeply ingrained in the administration. At the end of May, for instance, in a move not apparently initiated by Musk or his staff, the Trump administration cut dozens of staff from the National Security Council, which advises the president on international affairs and coordinates the interagency policymaking process. This move, according to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who also replaced Mike Waltz to lead the NSC, is intended to make the NSC hew more closely to “its original purpose and the President's vision.” But, according to Axios, an anonymous official put it more bluntly: “The NSC is the ultimate Deep State. . . . We're gutting the Deep State.”

Critics argue that such drastic cuts to the federal government will ultimately diminish U.S. influence in the world. Yet it is worth remembering that debates over the size and scope of the NSC and other parts of the national security bureaucracy fit squarely in a long-standing American political tradition. Indeed, the recent attacks on bureaucracy—and especially the national security bureaucracy—are reminiscent of the immediate aftermath of World War II.

With the U.S. victory in 1945, the shattering of the international order that preceded it, and the emergence of the Soviet Union as a military and ideological rival, midcentury American political and intellectual circles broadly accepted that there could be no return to Washington's pre-war military readiness or its foreign policy of relative aloofness from global affairs. But precisely what a “new normal” should look like was hotly debated. Internationalists believed the United States should maintain a robust overseas role, while conservatives were skeptical of international intervention. From those debates emerged the U.S. national security state—the collection of government agencies and organizations that focus on protecting citizens from external threats.

Thanks to its success winning the Cold War, the national security state has been treated almost as sacrosanct by the U.S. foreign policy establishment, with its logic and institutions going unchallenged and unchecked for decades. Now that the Trump administration has revived a 75-year-old debate, however, the United States has an opportunity to remember and learn from those midcentury conversations—with the most important lesson of all being that the national security state was a product both of political compromise and of the particular threat it was designed to counter. Ensuring U.S. national security in the future requires not simply reversing DOGE's cuts or restaffing various organizations but fighting for new compromises and considering new threats.

In the aftermath of World War II, as communism and Soviet power spread abroad, the priority for American policymakers of all stripes was to defend the United States' democracy and its way of life. Yet there were two distinct views on how to accomplish this, and each side felt the other's proposed policies would bring about the very calamity they aimed to prevent. Internationalists believed that the United States had to cast off its historic caution overseas and take up the mantle of international leadership that had fallen in Washington's lap. This meant, among other things, building lasting alliances, sustaining a permanent military presence abroad, and preparing for what was anticipated to be “total war” of one great power against another. Conservatives were appalled at these ideas, which in their view ran counter to traditional American political culture, represented the very sort of European imperialism America's founders had rebelled against, and militarized U.S. society in a way that would erode democracy.

Conservatives argued instead for focusing on domestic affairs, which had been relatively neglected during the war, and returning to an older approach to U.S. foreign policy—one that emphasized the Western Hemisphere and insisted on the reduction of defense budgets. In 1947, as President Harry Truman and his Secretary of State George Marshall peddled their proposal to provide billions of dollars in postwar reconstruction aid to Europe, Congressman Harold Knutson of Minnesota described the Marshall Plan as “tax-and-borrow-and-spend in other countries” and suggested the men were captive to the “intelligentsia, one-worlders, and do-gooders.” He derided supporters of the spending in his own party as “internationally-minded, ‘me-too' Republicans”—echoes of today's “RINO,” or Republican in name only, epithet. Internationalists returned the conservatives' scorn in full measure, arguing that their “Fortress America” would allow adversaries to prosper and accumulate power and that the United States could not survive as a democratic island in a communist and authoritarian world.

The end of this story is by now well known: the internationalists prevailed, their case helped immeasurably by global events, including crises in Czechoslovakia, Greece, and Turkey; the Soviet Union's successful atomic test; and the triumph of communists in China. As Truman asserted in sketching his eponymous doctrine in 1947, it would be the “policy of the United States to support free peoples,” and the United States had every intention of remaining a global and interventionist power. Yet, as detailed by the American historian Michael Hogan in A Cross of Iron, the national security state Truman and other internationalists went on to build was nevertheless the product of compromise. Despite his foreign policy leanings, Truman sought to reduce defense spending and restore balanced budgets—which were still considered an American tradition—and he stood firm against the most ambitious proposals coming from his administration, such as the unification of the military under an all-powerful commander or the institution of universal military training for Americans.

To be sure, the resulting national security system had a strong internationalist bias. The newly formed National Security Council, for example, rejected proposals to include once dominant domestic cabinet agencies such as Agriculture and Commerce—but checks on its power were included in its design. Rather than a single consolidated structure, the national security state worked via committee and coordination. Limits were imposed on both the military and the brand-new Central Intelligence Agency to prevent them from becoming more powerful. The CIA, for example, could not readily access domestic law enforcement information, nor could it participate in policy debates; and the secretary of defense received only a slim staff to allay concerns that the role would be too powerful.

But if the national security state built after World War II was designed in part to accommodate conservative concerns about imperial overreach, that compromise quickly fell by the wayside.

After the 1950s, the national security apparatus grew inexorably: the U.S. Information Agency, which aimed to influence foreign public opinion, was created in 1953; eight years later, the government created the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which administers foreign aid and development assistance, and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which provides intelligence support to the Department of Defense and the U.S. military; and other organizations devoted to preventing and resolving conflicts abroad such as the National Endowment for Democracy and the U.S. Institute of Peace were created in the 1980s. Each new body had a logic of its own, but each also pushed the United States further from its roots as a noninterventionist state.

By the 1990s, the national security state had succeeded in the mission it was designed for: to secure victory in the Cold War. Yet that success carried significant costs, many of which were predicted by conservative commentators. Conservatives of the late 1940s, for instance, worried that the creation of the national security state portended high taxes, permanent budget deficits, the growth of presidential power, and the atrophying of traditional domestic institutions such as local governments and religious organizations that had until then dominated American life. Conservatives and self-professed realists had also warned that the internationalists' logic was a recipe for fruitless conflict. The political commentator Walter Lippmann, for example, thought that the policy of containment articulated by the U.S. diplomat George Kennan played to Soviet rather than American advantages: Lippmann wrote that Kennan's strategy meant that “Moscow, not Washington, would select the ground where the conflict was to be waged, and would choose the weapons.” Washington, he believed, would be drawn into conflicts by partners about whom it knew little and would ultimately be forced either to abandon them or to indefinitely defend them at enormous cost. Although Lippmann was wrong about the failure of the United States' Cold War strategy, warnings such as these proved prescient in Vietnam and elsewhere.

Congressional conservatives made a brief comeback in the 1990s, under former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's leadership, but a full-throated debate over the national security state's merits still did not resume. If anything, the quick and overwhelming victory in the Gulf War coupled with victory in the Cold War led many to believe the United States was “uniquely capable of influencing world events,” as the Clinton administration official Martin Indyk put it. By the time of the 9/11 attacks, the national security state was primed and ready to resume its expansion. Indeed, facing an urgent crisis, the administration of George W. Bush largely repurposed, strengthened, and expanded the existing national security state, with violent Islamist extremism standing in for communism. The government created the Department of Homeland Security, the Homeland Security Council, and the office of the Director of National Intelligence and partially eased the restrictions on intelligence sharing originally meant to dampen the CIA's power. The NSC staff, which numbered 34 in the early 1970s and roughly 50 in the early 1990s, grew to over 200.

The widespread perception that Washington's post-9/11 wars—and by implication, the policy apparatus behind them—had failed to deliver gains took hold as early as the end of Bush's second term. A decade later, it had become conventional wisdom. This perception helped to finally reignite the debate that conservatives initiated in the late 1940s, along with calls to end “forever wars” and to redirect U.S. resources to domestic needs. These sentiments became the mainstream Republican view with Trump's rise to power, which occurred in parallel with the emergence of think tanks devoted to isolationism or restraint, such as the Quincy Institute and Defense Priorities.

The second Trump administration is arguably the first in which this faction of conservatives, a throwback to the days of Herbert Hoover and Robert Taft, have a major role in national security issues. After many years in exile, it should be little surprise that they have largely picked up where their political and intellectual predecessors left off and are now bringing the rest of the party with them. One-time internationalist hawks such as Rubio, for instance, are helping to lead the reorientation in U.S. foreign policy. In his first official remarks as secretary of state, he called for a greater emphasis on hemispheric issues and on internal security, and he has been eager to slash budgets and shrink the agencies he oversees, including the NSC, USAID, and the State Department. These priorities reflect a political tradition largely relegated to the fringes during the Cold War and the so-called war on terror, but one that remained alive, relevant to political debates, and deeply rooted in American society even when it was not dominant. Although its adherents are not monolithic in their views by any means, it is a tradition that differs from internationalism in that it views broad U.S. entanglement in international affairs as delivering more risk than reward, more cost than benefit.

Yet there is an incoherence to many of Trump's initiatives that would cause midcentury conservatives to blanch. Budget deficits, for example, have grown not as a result of the national security state but because of the expansion of entitlements and the growing number of Americans who qualify for them as the population ages. According to the Petersen Foundation, from 2001 to 2023, discretionary outlays, which include all spending on national security, grew from 6.2 to 6.4 percent of GDP. Mandatory outlays, which include social security, Medicare, and Medicaid, grew from 9.6 to 13.9 percent of GDP over that same period, as net interest on the U.S. debt grew from 2.0 to 2.4 percent of GDP. DOGE efforts, such as gutting USAID and the U.S. Institute of Peace, will not only fail to put a dent in this problem but ironically target spending that may be among the national security state's most efficient. For the cost of a couple of fighter jets, these agencies aim to prevent or slow the growth of conflicts and crises that, if left unaddressed, might become far more costly for the United States. These cuts also exacerbate a risk that used to alarm the sort of conservatives now in power in Washington: foreign partners may increasingly see the U.S. military as their most stable and effective counterpart in Washington. This trend is already noticeable with the rise of powerful combatant commanders in Europe, the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific.

More fundamentally, the Trump administration's efforts to kneecap the national security state have been paired with the expansion of Trump's presidential power. The unilateral imposition of tariffs is one example, but so is a more hierarchical method of crafting national security policy: presidential comments or social media posts, for example, have replaced the postwar bottom-up system. Although small-government conservatism and limits on the power of the presidency are as old as the Republic, this trend is newer and arguably began with conservative frustrations in the 1980s that President Ronald Reagan was hampered in his ability to carry out his agenda by a too-powerful Congress. Whatever the merits of Trump's campaign, the combined effect of an increase in presidential power and a dismantling of national security institutions means there will be ever-greater power concentrated in ever-fewer hands—the very outcome that postwar conservatives were determined to avert.

In the debates preceding the construction of the national security state in the 1940s and 1950s, there was a surprising degree of consensus regarding the threats faced by the United States. For all the acrimony that has attended DOGE's scorched-earth campaign against the national security state and Trump's efforts to consolidate power in his own hands, the same degree of consensus exists today: there is near unanimity among national security experts regarding the futility of recent wars and the need to focus on nuclear-armed great-power rivals—namely, China and Russia. Differences among ideological factions regarding how to address those threats are sharp, but no more so than those in the immediate aftermath of World War II. Indeed, the debates and the rhetoric are eerily similar. It is worth remembering how those earlier debates led to compromises that produced a thoroughgoing reform of the bureaucracy that, while imperfect, served American needs at a critical time.

For their part, modern-day internationalists should recognize that the national security system that won the Cold War is not sacrosanct but in need of reconsideration: it was designed for different threats in a different century, and its failings provide useful lessons for the current generation of policymakers. Merely reversing Trump's cuts and repurposing the old system for new threats—such as arguing that competition with China is a “new cold war”—is insufficient. Yet they are right that U.S. engagement in the world is more necessary than ever; any notion of retreating to our own hemisphere or carving the world into spheres of influence is nonsensical when facing adversaries with innumerable ways to cause the United States direct harm. And they are right that the nonmilitary tools of power are critical if war is to be avoided and peace won. The federal government must provide a home both to those with critical skills of the obscure sort—such as nuclear weapons scientists or pathogen researchers—and those with highly marketable expertise in emerging technologies.

Newly triumphant traditional conservatives, meanwhile, are right that a slimmer national security state could serve U.S. interests better than the bloated structure that emerged from the Cold War and the war on terror. Communication between capitals is far more direct than in the past, and the policy process must unfold more quickly to keep up with the pace of information and events. Most important, the United States must more ruthlessly prioritize given the sharp decrease in its advantages in relative power. But they should also instinctively recognize the danger in sweeping away a system that served U.S. national security well for decades, with no plan or strategy for replacing it beyond trusting in the intelligence, goodwill, and restraint of the handful of officials who accumulate power in the wake of the cuts.

Just as in the aftermath of World War II, it is not in the single-minded pursuit of either side's vision that the United States will find success, but in achieving compromise between them. The Silicon Valley ethos embraced by DOGE is often described as “move fast and break things.” Washington's ethos, however, has often been described as “in crisis, opportunity.” The breaking of the national security state is indeed a crisis, but it also creates an opportunity for the Trump administration or its successors to finally build a new national security state tailored to the world's present-day threats as well as the United States' deep-rooted and disparate political traditions.

            Being the strong favorite to win a golf tournament isn't always an easy responsibility to bear. Just ask Scottie Scheffler, who has revealed that he was forced to close his Venmo account because of bettors staking money on his performance.
    


            Ahead of this week's US Open at Pennsylvania's Oakmont Country Club, for which Scheffler is the strong favorite, the world No. 1 explained how he often hears from fans who have a financial interest in where he finishes at tournaments.

            “That's why I had to get rid of my Venmo because I was either getting paid by people or people requesting me a bunch of money when I didn't win,” he told reporters. “It wasn't a good feeling.”
    


            Asked about the biggest sum he had ever been sent as a thank you, Scheffler added: “I don't remember the most that somebody would send me. Maybe a couple bucks here or there. That didn't happen nearly as much as the requests did.”
    


            Scheffler has never won a US Open, but he enters the tournament with three wins in his last four appearances, which includes winning a third major title at the PGA Championship last month.
    


            After suffering a freak hand injury while cooking Christmas dinner and spending time away from the game to recover, Scheffler's recent results signal a clear return to form. He underlined his dominance with a four-shot victory at the Memorial Tournament in his last outing, joining Tiger Woods as the only back-to-back winners of the event.
    


            However, the 28-year-old said that he doesn't dwell on his status as a frequent pre-tournament favorite.
    


            “Starting Thursday morning, we're at even par and it's up to me to go out there and play against the golf course and see what I can do,” said Scheffler.
    


            Oakmont Country Club, which is hosting the US Open for a record 10th time, is a daunting prospect for even the world's best golfers, with fast greens and thick, unforgiving rough.
    


            Low scores are not expected this week, and Scheffler went as far as to call it “probably the hardest golf course that we'll play maybe ever.”
    


            He added: “When you talk about strength and power, I think that becomes more of a factor in these tournaments because, when you hit it into the rough, you've got to muscle it out of there.”
    


            Scheffler, seeking his fourth title of the year, tees off at 1:25 p.m. ET on Thursday in a group with Viktor Hovland and Collin Morikawa.

            House Republicans are touting that their sweeping tax and spending cuts package would kick many “illegal immigrants” off federal assistance, fulfilling one of President Donald Trump's top priorities.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson has repeatedly emphasized that the bill would stop 1.4 million “illegal aliens” from accessing Medicaid. The tax portion of the package has a section on “removing taxpayer benefits from illegal immigrants.” And the House Agriculture Committee crafted a provision to restrict food stamp eligibility for “illegal aliens.”
    


            However, undocumented immigrants in the US won't be as heavily affected by the legislation since they already can't access nearly all federal government assistance programs, experts say. Those more in danger of losing some benefits are millions of legal immigrants, as well as children who are citizens but whose parents may be undocumented or have various legal statuses.

House GOP lawmakers are proposing nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and food stamps. Here's who could be impacted



            “It's part of a campaign of misinformation,” said Tanya Broder, senior counsel of health and economic justice at the National Immigration Law Center. “This bill would deny eligibility to lawfully residing immigrants who have authorization to live and work in the US and who pay taxes that support the services that we all depend on.”
    


            The legislation, which is now in the Senate, where it may be changed, would greatly limit the categories of legal immigrants who can qualify for a variety of federal benefits, including the child tax credit, food stamps, Affordable Care Act subsidies and Medicare. It also takes aim at states that provide Medicaid-like coverage to undocumented immigrants with their own funds.
    


            Currently, immigrants' eligibility for federal benefits depends on their status, of which there are many categories. Among those authorized to be in the US, certain groups can qualify right away, others must wait several years. Some immigrant children and pregnant women can access Medicaid sooner if states opt to allow them. But immigrants with other legal statuses do not qualify for any public assistance. (All of them must also meet the other eligibility criteria for the benefit programs, including income limits.)
    


            Undocumented immigrants generally only qualify for what's known as Emergency Medicaid, which reimburses hospitals for the emergency care they are required to provide. These patients would have to be eligible for Medicaid were it not for their immigration status. Separately, some states provide health coverage to certain undocumented immigrants, most commonly children, using only state funds.
    


            At least one advocate for tighter controls on immigration thinks the House GOP bill misses the mark. Taking away benefits from immigrants already in the US does not address the underlying problem of illegal immigration, said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies.
    


            “This bill nibbles around the edges,” said Camarota. “Will it have that much of an effect? That's the question.”
    


            The proposed changes could have devastating consequences for vulnerable immigrant communities, particularly those who rely on public benefits to survive, said Beatriz Ortiz, a senior staff attorney at the International Rescue Committee. Prior to joining IRC, Ortiz worked at Ayuda, where she represented immigrants as a staff attorney.
    


            “If you don't give people the possibility … the tools, they won't have a dignified life,” Ortiz said.
    


            One of the most consequential changes involves the child tax credit, which House Republicans want to temporarily boost to $2,500 per child, from $2,000. Under the bill, a child's parents would have to have Social Security numbers, in addition to the child.
    


            Currently, families can receive the credit if the parents file their tax returns with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN, which is used by some legal and undocumented immigrants — as long as the child has a Social Security number.
    


            This provision could leave about 2 million children ineligible for the child tax credit, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, which analyzed the bill. The Center for Migration Studies estimates the number is closer to 4.5 million children who are US citizens or lawful permanent residents, otherwise known as green card holders.
    


            “It singles out and disadvantages US citizen children because of their parents' immigration status,” said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noting that research shows the credit has a positive impact on children's health, educational attainment and, eventually, earnings. “That's really alarming.”
    


            Similarly, the “Trump accounts” that the legislation would create would require both parents to have Social Security numbers to be eligible to claim the $1,000 federal contribution for their US-born citizen babies.
    


            Fewer immigrants would be eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the formal name for food stamps, if the House bill becomes law. Refugees, people approved for asylum, domestic violence victims and survivors of labor or sex trafficking would no longer qualify. Only citizens, green card holders, certain Cuban parolees and migrants from certain Pacific Ocean island nations would be able to receive food stamps.
    


            Between 120,000 and 250,000 people would lose access to this food assistance over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Families with citizen children would also feel the pinch – even if the kids would continue to qualify, the household would receive less assistance each month if the parents are no longer eligible.
    


            Gloria, who fled gang violence in El Salvador in 2010 hoping for safety in the US, worries that she could lose a portion of the food stamps that she and her five children, who are citizens, depend on. The family receives a total of $900 a month in benefits.
    


            “I'm about to have a baby; I'm a single mom. If this president decided to take it away, I would be very affected. I live off the SNAP benefits,” said Gloria, who lives in Washington DC and has a T-visa, a protection for trafficking survivors.
    


            Gloria, who asked that CNN not use her full name for fear of retribution, said she was trafficked by her own mother and aunt in Maryland — forced to work at a carpet factory, sleep on the floor and hand over all her wages under threats of deportation from her own family until she finally escaped.
    


            Gloria recently earned her GED, is studying to become a medical assistant and is also learning English. Still, she says she needs continued support to achieve her goals and become fully self-sufficient.
    


            One asylum recipient from Egypt, who asked to be identified only as H.E. so as not to jeopardize his immigration status, told CNN that he depends on food stamps.
    


            “If I lose those benefits, it's going to be bad,” said H.E., who lives in a shelter in Virginia, is unemployed and has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
    


            The package would also block many legal immigrants from receiving Affordable Care Act premium subsidies and Medicare coverage, making it harder for them to obtain health coverage from both the government and private insurers.
    


            Under the bill, asylees, refugees, temporary protected status holders and victims of domestic violence or sex trafficking, among others, would no longer be eligible for Obamacare subsidies or Medicare, even if they worked in the US for the 10-plus years it takes for senior citizens to qualify for the latter program.
    


            One million more people would be uninsured in 2034 if these immigrants lost access to the Affordable Care Act subsidies, according to CBO estimates.
    


            As for Medicaid, which House Republicans have targeted for steep spending cuts, the bill would not alter immigrants' eligibility for the federal program. However, it would levy steep penalties on states that have opted to expand coverage that's similar to Medicaid to a broader array of non-citizens, including undocumented immigrants, using their own funds. Some 14 states plus the District of Columbia cover at least some undocumented residents through these initiatives.
    


            The House bill would cut the share of federal matching funds these states receive for covering low-income adults under Medicaid expansion to 80%, from 90%, which would double states' costs.
    


            How states would react would likely vary, but experts fear that many would have to limit or end their programs covering undocumented residents. The CBO expects this provision would result in 1.4 million more people being uninsured in 2034 – the figure that Johnson often cites, even though these folks are not enrolled in the federal Medicaid program.
    


            The penalty could also hit the states that cover immigrant children and pregnant women with certain legal statuses – including those with temporary protected status and student visas – through a separate state Children's Health Insurance Program. Some 21 states have opted to do so for children and six for pregnant women.
    


            But since the penalty only applies to states that have expanded Medicaid, Pennsylvania and West Virginia would be hit, for instance, but not Florida or Texas, said Leonardo Cuello, research professor for the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. Most states would not be able to afford to continue these optional programs.
    


            “The states are going to have a huge incentive to drop their coverage because the alternative is a massive increase in spending,” he said.

Follow:


    Editor's Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex's Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.



            In the heat of the Jamaican sun, where the wetlands glisten and buzz with life, an ancient predator is vanishing.
    


            There are around 28 species of crocodiles found throughout the world's tropical and subtropical regions. But there is only one species in Jamaica, found primarily along the southern coast from St. Thomas to Westmoreland.
    


            Once revered and feared across the island, the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) has long ruled the mangroves and coastal lagoons.
    


            But in recent years, its population has been decimated, due to illegal hunting, habitat loss and plastic pollution, as well as killings prompted by a lingering fear among locals.
    


            Lawrence Henriques has made it his life's mission to change that.
    


            Known as “The Crocodile Guardian,” Henriques has spent the past four decades fighting for their survival.
    


            He runs the Holland Bay Crocodile Sanctuary, a grassroots conservation project in the southeast of the island, perched on the edge of what he says is one of Jamaica's last viable crocodile habitats.
    


            From this remote corner of the island, he's trying to undo years of damage: nursing sick crocs back to health, raising juveniles and restoring their numbers in the wild.
    


            “There's a real fear of crocodiles in Jamaica,” says Henriques. “They're not tolerated by a lot of people. So if one turns up in someone's backyard, it's often killed for meat or just because people are afraid.”
    


            Although crocodiles are often seen as aggressive and dangerous, attacks are few and far between. While reliable figures are hard to come by, according to the global database CrocAttack, there have been 11 incidents reported over the past decade in Jamaica, including one fatality in 2018.
    


            That's why Henriques is working to change the narrative about the animal and help people understand that they are far less threatening than their reputation suggests.
    


            Born and raised in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, during the 1960s, Henriques always had a penchant for “creepy crawlies,” such as spiders, scorpions and snakes.
    


            But it was crocodiles that truly captured his attention.
    


            “We had a lot more crocodiles and a lot more habitat in those days,” he recalls. “I always had a half a dozen or so baby crocodiles rearing in my bedroom.”
    


            That fascination eventually became a vocation. After studying overseas and learning more about reptiles when working with the Scientific Exploration Society, a UK charity, in Belize, Henriques returned to Jamaica in 1980.  He was startled to find that despite crocodiles being classified as endangered in 1971 under the Wildlife Protection Act, there was little practical conservation happening.



            “The laws were there, but nobody was doing anything,” he says. “The environmental agency was very under-resourced and still is to this day. And there was nobody really with expertise or knowledge on reptiles.”
    


            Henriques volunteered to assist the Jamaican government, carrying out crocodile rescues and providing rehabilitation, all while holding down a job in the citrus industry.
    


            He continued like this for almost 20 years, before a brief relocation to London, UK. When he returned to Jamaica in 2010, he launched what would become the Holland Bay Crocodile Sanctuary — a facility dedicated to rescue, rehabilitation and public education.
    


            The sanctuary, which lies on the edge of a wetland, is home to 27 adult crocodiles along with 18 baby crocs. The juvenile crocs have been bred on site and are typically released into the wild after three years, while the adults have been rescued and rehabilitated after being hit by cars, caught in traps, or found living in squalid conditions. Over the past three years, around 90 have been successfully released back into the wild according to Henriques.
    


            One of the crocodiles living at the sanctuary currently is Xena, who was discovered guarding her eggs in an area littered with trash, her skin slimy and her teeth gray from pollution.
    


            Savannah Boan, an international ambassador from Gatorland Global, the conservation arm of the Florida-based wildlife park which helps to fund the sanctuary, says that since being relocated, Xena's skin has healed and her teeth are white again. Her babies have also been raised at the facility and released into safe areas, helping to boost wild populations of the species.
    


            “Lawrence is doing extraordinary work with very limited resources,” she tells CNN.
    


            Despite legal protections, crocodiles in Jamaica face growing threats. Poaching is rampant, often driven by demand for meat or misguided fear, according to officers from the country's National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA).
    


            “Poaching is definitely a huge problem,” says Leighton Mamdeen, an environmental officer at NEPA. “We try to limit it through enforcement measures such as regular monitoring and we partner with the Jamaica Constabulary Force and the Jamaica Defence Force to do patrols.”



            According to media reports, there is a thriving black market for crocodile meat and eggs in Jamaica, with the meat sold for as much as 5,000 Jamaican dollars ($31) a pound (450 grams) – more than 10 times the price of chicken meat.
    


            This could stem from a widespread misconception in some rural communities that crocodile meat has aphrodisiac properties.
    


            Damany Calder, another environmental officer at NEPA, says he has noticed a troubling pattern during callouts, when crocodiles are discovered with their tails removed.



            “There's a rumour about the crocodile tail… it's (used) either for sexual performance, fertility or longevity,” he says.

            In other cases, crocodiles have been found in backyard ponds, kept as pets, or used as props for TikTok stunts or music videos. There was even a time when a small live crocodile was found stuffed in a broken fridge, says Calder. He believes it may have been part of a ritual referred to as Obeah, a Jamaican religious tradition similar to voodoo.
    


            Social media videos have occasionally resulted in prosecutions but only if culprits are caught in the act, Calder says. Individuals found guilty of killing crocodiles may be charged a maximum fine of $100,000 or face one-year imprisonment.
    


            “The police are heavily involved, and they're trying to improve the penalties,” says Henriques.
    


            “But like everything else, it's catching the person and proving it in court. It's a very long, drawn-out process.”
    


            Development is another killer.
    


            Jamaica's mangroves and wetlands are currently being cleared for tourism and residential development according to The Forestry Department. This affects the country's coastal resilience, as mangroves reduce wave energy and storm surges, helping to prevent flooding, and it damages biodiversity, as they are serve as nurseries for fish and provide essential habitat for species like crocodiles.
    


            As this territory shrinks, crocodiles are forced closer to humans.
    


            “These animals are ending up in places they've always lived,” Henriques says. “But now those places are towns and roads … We've taken their habitat.”

            To Henriques, the crocodile isn't a menace — it's a keystone species that has been on the island for millions of years. It even features on the Jamaican coat of arms, which shows a crocodile perched atop a royal helmet and mantling, designed to symbolize the island's unique wildlife and natural heritage.
    


            “They're like engineers of the ecosystem,” he says. “They dig channels, control fish populations and keep the wetlands healthy.”
    


            He explains that the presence of these apex predators helps to regulate biodiversity within aquatic ecosystems by controlling prey populations and creating microhabitats that support various flora and fauna.



            But Henriques warns that because of poaching and habitat loss, the island no longer has many large male crocodiles left along the coastline: “Most now are smaller. It's a serious shift.”



            “What's happening in Jamaica reflects a global pattern — wetland species are disappearing, and with them, the health of the entire ecosystem,” he adds.
    


            Despite the challenges, there's a cautious sense of hope.
    


            Henriques and NEPA have ramped up community outreach and education programs, especially in areas near crocodile habitats.
    


            “One of the most impactful things we've done is visit schools,” says Mamdeen. “If you start with the kids, you'll have a greater chance of securing the animal's future.”



            When reports of a crocodile in a pool of water near a school caused panic among parents and children, NEPA directed its outreach efforts toward local students.
    


            “We told them: crocodiles would rather run (from you) than rush (towards) you,” he says. “If you're near water at night, walk with a stick. If the animal is touched, it moves.”
    


            Henriques added: “People are beginning to understand these animals have a place … They're not pests. They're survivors.”
    


            Still, the sanctuary is one of only a few conservation efforts on the island, and without continued support, Henriques fears Jamaica's crocodiles may not survive the next few decades.
    


            “We can't afford to lose them,” he says. “They've been here longer than we have. They're part of this land.”

Protests against immigration enforcement raids have spread beyond Los Angeles to cities including Seattle, Austin, Chicago and Washington, D.C. While many have been peaceful, some have resulted in clashes with law enforcement. More protests are planned nationwide this week.

What to know:



No officers were hit. 

Both people are charged with possession of an unregistered destructive device, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said at a press conference Wednesday.

“You can make a statement, but you can't throw bombs or Molotov cocktails,” Essayli said.

Investigators are combing through FBI videos, body camera footage from law enforcement and other evidence on social media, said Essayli. 

Authorities expect to charge more people in the coming days and weeks.






The U.S. Department of Homeland Security revealed names of nine people arrested by immigration authorities in Los Angeles on Monday and Tuesday with criminal convictions, including one for homicide and burglary and others for drug trafficking and child endangerment. 

It used those cases to portray violent criminals as its primary targets and accuse political opponents of coddling them.

“How much longer will Governor (Gavin) Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass continue to prioritize these criminal illegal aliens over their own citizens?” said Tricia McLaughlin, a department spokesperson. “Secretary (Kristi) Noem has a message to the LA rioters: you will not stop us or slow us down. ICE will continue to enforce the law and arrest criminal illegal aliens.”

Chicago police say a 66-year-old woman was injured when she was struck by a car during downtown protests Tuesday evening.

Crowds of demonstrators rallying in solidarity with activists in Los Angeles took over a plaza and some surrounding streets amid rush hour traffic. Video footage shows a car speeding through a roadway where people were standing and were protesting.

Police said Wednesday that the injured woman fractured her left arm and was treated at a local hospital.

No other injuries were reported.

Chicago police say detectives are investigating. No charges have been filed.

The defense of Newsom came as House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer were asked how Newsom should be dealing with Trump.

Jeffries said Newsom “has been doing a tremendous job on behalf of the people of California.” He then used the question to state Democrats believe along with Newsom that anybody who commits violence or destroys property should be held accountable to the full extent of that law. At the same time, people have a right to “peacefully protest and petition their government.”

Schumer said that Trump has been trying to intimidate Newsom.

“He has shown he's not going to be intimidated, and we're all for that,” Schumer said of Newsom. “All for him and proud that he is refusing to be intimidated by Donald Trump.”

The protests took place around Foley Square Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning.

Many in the large crowds, which police estimated at around 2,500 people, shouted out against federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement and waved signs that included “ICE out of NYC” as they rallied near an ICE facility and federal courthouses.

Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the vast majority of demonstrators were peaceful. She blamed smaller groups for causing the disorder that required police intervention.

Police said they took 86 people into custody, including 52 who were released with criminal court summonses for minor crimes and 34 who were charged with assault, resisting arrest and other crimes.

Some protesters clashed with police when they jumped over metal barricades and were wrestled to the ground by officers. Video also showed demonstrators throwing items at law enforcement vehicles.

About 700 Marines are still undergoing civil disturbance training at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach in Orange County, California, said Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, head of the task force that's overseeing the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles. 

Sherman wouldn't speculate about when the Marines might join the 2,000 or so Guard troops that have been deployed in downtown areas to protect federal buildings during sometimes violent demonstrations against President Trump's immigration crackdown. 

Another 2,000 Guard troops were expected to mobilize on Thursday, he said during a news conference.

The streets of downtown Los Angeles began bustling with residents walking dogs and commuters clutching coffee cups after the overnight curfew was lifted at 6 a.m. Wednesday. 

Officials said at least two dozen people were arrested for violating the curfew, but overall they were fewer clashes between police and demonstrators than on previous nights. 

There were no signs of Marines deployed to downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday, joining the National Guard troops that are protecting federal buildings and ICE agents making arrests.

A coalition of 18 Democratic attorneys general on Wednesday condemned the Trump administration for what they called the unlawful deployment of the California National Guard amid the protests in Los Angeles.

“The president's decision to federalize and deploy California's National Guard without the consent of California state leaders is unlawful, unconstitutional, and undemocratic,” the attorneys general said in a statement released by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. They said the Trump administration should be working with local leaders to keep everyone safe, “not mobilizing the military against the American people.”

In their capacity as the chief legal officers of the 18 states, they also expressed support for California Attorney General Rob Bonta's court challenge to Trump's order.

“We oppose any action from this administration that will sow chaos, inflame tensions, and put people's lives at risk — including those of our law-enforcement officers,” they wrote.

The statement was joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, and Vermont.

The hundreds who marched Tuesday evening down thoroughfares in the city, blocking traffic and chanting, were eventually told to disperse by police.

Officers used smoke and pepper balls -- similar to paintballs but filled with a substance akin to pepper spray -- to control the crowd, the Denver Police Department said in a statement Wednesday.

Three people were arrested on assault charges, according to Denver police. Other charges included graffiti, unlawfully throwing projectiles and failing to following the police's orders.

Claudia Sheinbaum said she would discuss the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary's accusation with Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau on Wednesday as he visits Mexico.

She rejected Noem's comments as “completely false” the day before, publishing a video of her in her morning press briefing calling for Mexicans to act in peace in the Los Angeles protests.

Sheinbaum added more details Wednesday — claiming her opponents had “completely taken out of context” her previous comments suggesting that Mexicans could protest a tax on remittances proposed by Trump.

“We have never called for a violent demonstration,” she said. “We are against all violent acts. We've always supported peaceful protests.”

Mayor Ron Nirenberg said city officials did not ask for the Texas National Guard to be deployed to the city ahead of planned protests Wednesday night and Saturday.

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's office said Tuesday night that National Guard troops were “on standby” in areas where demonstrations are planned. That came came after police in Austin used chemical irritants to disperse several hundred demonstrators Monday near the state Capitol.

Wednesday night's protest in San Antonio are scheduled to be near the Alamo, in the heart of the city's downtown.

San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said he has not been told by either the governor's office or the guard how many troops would be in the city, where they would be positioned or what they will be doing. The governor's office has not publicly released those details.

McManus said the city police are ready to handle any security issues with the demonstration.

“We are prepared for a peaceful demonstration, but we are also prepared if something goes south and it turns violent,” McManus said.

Immigration raids across Southern California are rattling the area's immigrant communities, even among those in the country legally. More than 100 people have been detained since Friday. 

In Orange County, a day laborer said he started carrying his green card everywhere. And during a news conference Monday, the family members of detained workers in Los Angeles urged officials to uphold the city and the state of California as places of sanctuary for immigrants.

From Seattle and Austin to Chicago and Washington, D.C., marchers have chanted slogans, carried signs against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and snarled traffic through downtown avenues and outside federal offices. While many have been peaceful, some have resulted in clashes with law enforcement as officers made arrests and used chemical irritants to disperse crowds.

Activists are planning more and even larger demonstrations in the coming days, with “No Kings” events across the country on Saturday to coincide with Trump's planned military parade through Washington.

The Trump administration said it would continue its program of raids and deportations despite the protests.

“ICE will continue to enforce the law,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted Tuesday on social media.

New York City police detained more than 80 people during protests around lower Manhattan's Foley Square against federal immigration enforcement actions Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump left open the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act, which authorizes the president to deploy military forces inside the U.S. to suppress rebellion or domestic violence or to enforce the law in certain situations. It's one of the most extreme emergency powers available to a U.S. president.

“If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We'll see,” he said from the Oval Office.

Los Angeles police swiftly enforced a downtown curfew, making arrests moments after it took effect, while deploying officers on horseback and using crowd control projectiles to break up a group of hundreds of demonstrators.

Members of the National Guard stood watch behind plastic shields, but did not appear to participate in the arrests Tuesday night.

Hours later, many of the protesters had dispersed, although sporadic confrontations continued that were much smaller than in previous nights.

The demonstrations have been mostly concentrated downtown and the curfew covers a 1-square-mile (2.5-square-kilometer) section that includes an area where protests have occurred since Friday in the sprawling city of 4 million.

Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom asked a court to put an emergency stop to the military helping federal immigration agents, with some guardsmen now standing in protection around agents as they carried out arrests. He said it would only heighten tensions and promote civil unrest. The judge set a hearing for Thursday, giving the administration several days to continue those activities.

President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that the United States will get magnets and rare earth minerals from China under a new trade deal and that tariffs on Chinese goods will go to 55%. In return, Trump said the U.S. will provide China “what was agreed to,” including allowing Chinese students to attend American colleges and universities.

Vice President JD Vance and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles called Musk on Friday and urged him to end his feud with Trump, according to two people familiar with the call who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The call was first reported Wednesday by the Wall Street Journal.

Trump's lawyer argued in a federal appellate court Wednesday that the case belongs in federal court, where his administration can throw it out. The Manhattan district attorney's office — which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court, argued the contrary. 

The judges — two nominated by President Barack Obama and one by President Joe Biden — were at turns skeptical and receptive to both sides' arguments on weighty and seldom-tested legal issues. 

The one thing everyone agreed on: It is a highly unusual case. Trump lawyer Jeffrey Wall said Trump is in “a class of one.”

The judges said they would issue a ruling at a later date. 

Trump was convicted in May 2024 of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels, whose affair allegations threatened to upend his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump denies her claim and said he did nothing wrong. It was the only one of his four criminal cases to go to trial. 

All 12 members of the board overseeing Fulbright scholarships have resigned in protest of what they call Trump administration meddling with the program established by Congress nearly 80 years ago as a non-ideological, bipartisan pillar of American diplomacy.

A statement published by the board members said the administration “usurped” the board's authority by denying awards to scholars who already had been selected for the 2025-2026 academic year. 

The resignations were first reported by The New York Times. A message seeking comment was left with the State Department, which runs the international scholarship program.

“We believe these actions not only contradict the statute but are antithetical to the Fulbright mission and the values, including free speech and academic freedom, that Congress specified in the statute,” the statement said. “It is our sincere hope that Congress, the courts, and future Fulbright Boards will prevent the administration's efforts to degrade, dismantle, or even eliminate one of our nation's most respected and valuable programs.”

Trump was the first guest on a new podcast launched Wednesday by New York Post columnist Miranda Devine. She asked the president if he could reconcile with or forgive Musk.

“I guess I could,” Trump said, “but, you know, we have to straighten out the country and my sole function now is getting this country back to a level higher than it's ever been.”

Hegseth explained to the Senate Defense Appropriations subcommittee that the National Guard will be on hand to support local law enforcement and help out if protests expand to other areas.

“Part of it is getting ahead of a problem,” Hegseth said. He said most states would welcome the help but “In California unfortunately the governor wants to play politics with it.”

As of Tuesday, Trump has authorized 4,100 National Guard members and 700 Marines to deploy to Los Angeles.

Thousands of middle and high school students from all 50 states and several countries are at the University of Maryland for the 51st National History Day Competition. 

It comes as Trump targets cultural establishments, downsizing the federal government and ending initiatives seen as promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, which he calls “discrimination.”

The student's work shows how difficult scrubbing history can be. Presentations range from Brown V. Board of Education, the landmark 1954 school desegregation case, to “The Dark History of Indian Boarding Schools” and “The Thind White Line,” the 1923 Supreme Court case that denied citizenship to Bhagat Singh Thind, a Caucasian, because he was not considered white.

Executive Director Cathy Gorn says the competition's goal is to show students “that people of all kinds of backgrounds, people of all kinds of shapes and sizes and colors and ethnicities have contributed to the building of this incredible country of ours. This is a great opportunity to truly show what America is about and at the same time say hey, it's also been a struggle.”

Tennessee is challenging a decades-old federal program that provides grants to colleges with large concentrations of Hispanic students, calling it discriminatory and unconstitutional.

In a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday, Tennessee's attorney general said the Hispanic Serving Institution program excludes schools based on “arbitrary ethnic targets.” None of the state's colleges have student populations that are at least 25% Hispanic, the eligibility threshold for the program.

Joining Tennessee is Students for Fair Admissions, a group whose lawsuit led to a 2023 Supreme Court decision removing race from college admissions.

The Hispanic Serving Institution program was created by Congress in 1992. Last year its grants totaled about $350 million. Tennessee's suit argues that all universities should be eligible for the money.

The Democratic leaders of the House and Senate are defending Gov. Gavin Newsom's handling of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in California, which prompted protests and now the president's deployment of the National Guard and Marines.

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries said Newsom “has been doing a tremendous job on behalf of the people of California.” Jeffries said Democrats believe along with Newsom that anybody who commits violence or destroys property should be held accountable to the full extent of that law. But he said that people have a right to “peacefully protest and petition their government.”

Sen. Chuck Schumer said Trump has been trying to bully the governor. 

“He has shown he's not going to be intimidated, and we're all for that,” Schumer said.

Wednesday's testimony by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine complicates Trump's justification for mass deportations.

Asked if he believes the U.S. is being invaded by a foreign power, Caine said: “I don't see any foreign state-sponsored folks invading but I'll be mindful of the fact that there have been some border issues.”

Asked whether he sees evidence of “rebellion” in the country — a word that arguably justifies using the Insurrection Act to send military units into U.S. states and cities over the objections of local officials — Caine said: “There are definitely some frustrated folks out there.”

Responding to the same question, Hegseth repeated Trump's argument that “there has been an invasion” of migrants entering the country without legal permission, and he said the protests in Los Angeles could spread to other areas.

“The system is old,” Bedford said. “So we have to do better.”

Pilots' unions and Democrats have raised concerns that Bedford may support weakening the 1,500-hour experience standard for airline pilots that was adopted after a 2009 crash, or might consider allowing some airlines to operate with only one pilot. 

Senators Maria Cantwell and Tammy Duckworth pressed him on maintaining the rule, noting that he had funded and lobbied to change it while he was running an airline. Bedford refused to make that commitment.

“I don't believe safety is static,” Bedford said, adding later: “I can commit to you that we will not have anything that will reduce safety.”

Trump's pick to lead the Federal Aviation Administration is facing tough questions about safety after a string of crashes and near misses since January's deadly collision over the Potomac River.

Much of the industry, including the major airlines and their trade groups, supports Bryan Bedford's nomination. But pilots unions and Democrats have raised concerns that he might weaken pilot training standards.

Bedford has been CEO of regional airline Republic Airways since 1999 and has more than three decades of experience in the industry. He has pledged to make safety the FAA's top priority and work to restore public confidence in flying. Bedford also said he'll work with Congress on Trump's multi-billion-dollar plan to overhaul the nation's air traffic control system.

The National Transportation Safety Board has said the FAA should have acted before the crash in Washington, D.C., because there had been 85 near misses reported around Ronald Reagan National Airport in the years prior. The FAA has banned some helicopter routes to keep helicopters and planes from sharing airspace, but there have been more near misses since then.

The defense secretary confirmed reports that the Qataris have not come to an agreement with the Trump administration over a memo that would allow the Department of Defense to take possession of the 747 jet, which Trump wants as his temporary Air Force One. This also means that no contracts have been signed to move forward on overhauling the aircraft.

“A memorandum of understanding remains to be signed,” Hegseth said, while refusing to answer senator's questions on the cost or potential timeframe of refurbishing the aircraft — even though data on two other 747s being reconditioned to serve as Air Force One by Boeing is public.

Trump toured the Qatari plane in February when it was parked at an airport near Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort.

The defense secretary told senators that the Pentagon budget includes hard choices and “reflects the reality that Europe needs to step up more for the defense of its own continent. And President Trump deserves the credit for that.” 

Questioned at a defense appropriations hearing about U.S. security support for Kyiv Hegseth did not respond when asked if the U.S. will send the remaining $3.8 billion in aid already approved. 

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., warned that Russia will not stop with its assault on Ukraine and said the U.S. has to end the war. Hegseth said a negotiated peace in Ukraine will make America look strong.

Testifying in front of the House Ways and Means committee, Scott Bessent was asked about Trump's stated desire to punish Harvard University and other non-profit organizations by directing the IRS to revoke their tax-exempt status.

Federal law prohibits the executive branch from exerting influence over taxpayer audits and other investigations.

Bessent told lawmakers: “The president and I have never had a conversation about Harvard's tax status.”

Asked whether he would commit to report back to the committee in 30 days as to whether he'd been directed by the executive branch to launch audits of any taxpayers, Bessent said “that is without question that I will follow the law.”

Claudia Sheinbaum said she would discuss the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary's accusation with Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau on Wednesday as he visits Mexico. 

She rejected Noem's comments as “completely false” the day before, publishing a video of her in her morning press briefing calling for Mexicans to act in peace in the Los Angeles protests.

Sheinbaum added more details Wednesday — claiming her opponents had “completely taken out of context” her previous comments suggesting that Mexicans could protest a tax on remittances proposed by Trump. 

“We have never called for a violent demonstration,” she said. “We are against all violent acts. We've always supported peaceful protests.”

Pete Hegseth met with bipartisan criticism Wednesday as the Senate defense appropriations subcommittee hearing kicked off.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, slammed him, saying that “more of your time so far has been spent inside the building on culture wars, rather than outside the building, deterring real ones.” 

He criticized Hegseth's moves to fire the previous chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other “qualified uniformed leaders” and said the Pentagon is worried more” about each other than America's enemies.

The chairman, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, expressed frustration that the Trump administration has yet to provide Congress with a full defense budget. He said current funding isn't enough to support the nation's defense, and the administration's limited budget request has no funding for Ukraine security assistance — casting doubt on the potential for “lasting peace.”

Hegseth said he has moved quickly to kill wasteful programs and redirect funding to Trump's priorities as his department assembles a comprehensive budget request.

The new spending line was tucked inside Trump's “big, beautiful bill” by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, whose chairman Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., has been at times a Trump critic.

The $40 million allotment would go to the National Endowment for the Humanities to build Trump's long-sought statue garden. He first proposed the idea in 2020 during a time of political turmoil in the U.S. over honoring people with racist and other views, and followed up with executive orders.

Trump's initial proposal for 30-plus “heroes” features Founding Fathers and presidents, civil rights pioneers and aviation innovators, explorers and generals, and the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Absent from Trump's initial list were any Native American, Hispanic or Asian-American individuals.

The president and first lady Melania Trump plan to attend the Kennedy Center's musical at a fraught moment, after he replaced the previous leadership with loyalists, had himself installed as chairman and pledged to rid the performing arts venue of programming he has complained is “woke” and too focused on leftist ideology and political correctness.

His takeover has upset some of the center's patrons and performers. Sales of subscription packages are said to have declined, “Hamilton” canceled its planned run and other artists scrapped appearances or resigned. Understudies may perform Wednesday night due to boycotts by “Les Misérables” cast members.

In March, the audience booed Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, after they slipped into upper-level seats in the Concert Hall to hear the National Symphony Orchestra. Trump appointed Usha Vance to the Kennedy Center board along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Fox News Channel hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham, among other supporters. 

Trump signed executive orders in April relaxing some of his 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts, a significant reversal as the import taxes threatened to hurt domestic manufacturers. Trump portrayed the changes as a bridge toward automakers moving more production into the United States.

But automakers and independent analyses say the remaining tariffs could raise prices, reduce sales and make U.S. production less competitive worldwide. Last month GM lowered its profit expectations for the year, estimating the impact of remaining auto tariffs at $5 billion for the company. 

GM said it will add production of the gas-powered Chevrolet Blazer and Chevrolet Equinox, which are made in Mexico, to its plants in Spring Hill, Tennessee and Kansas City, Kansas in 2027. GM will also begin making gas-powered full-size SUVs and light duty pickup trucks in Orion Township, Michigan. 

CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday that GM is committed to building vehicles in the U.S. through 50 U.S. plants and parts facilities that support nearly 1 million American jobs.

The Netherlands-based Global Rights Compliance says Avon, Walmart, Nescafe, Coca-Cola and paint supplier Sherwin-Williams may be among companies linked to titanium sourced from Xinjiang, where rights groups allege the Chinese government runs coercive labor practices targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities.



The report found 77 Chinese suppliers in the titanium, lithium, beryllium and magnesium industries operating in Xinjiang are at risk of participating in China's “labor transfer programs,” in which Uyghur are forced to work in factories as part of a long-standing campaign of assimilation and mass detention. 

The named companies didn't immediately comment.

A U.N. report from 2022 found China may have committed crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, where more than 1 million Uyghurs are estimated to have been arbitrarily detained as China targets terrorism and separatism. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said the forced labor allegations are “nothing but a lie.”

President Joe Biden signed a law blocking imports from Xinjiang unless businesses can prove they were made without forced labor. 

Trump says US will get magnets and rare earth minerals from China in a deal imposing 55% tariffs on Chinese goods — up sharply from the 30% set in Switzerland during talks in May.

In return, Trump said the U.S. will provide China “what was agreed to,” including allowing Chinese students to attend American colleges and universities.

Trump recently had begun to clamp down on Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses.

U.S. inflation picked up a bit last month as food costs rose, though overall inflation remained mostly tame.

Consumer prices increased 2.4% last month compared to a year ago, according to a Labor Department report released Wednesday. That is up from a 2.3% yearly increase in April. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.8% for the third straight month. Economists pay close attention to core prices because they generally provide a better sense of where inflation is headed.

The figures suggest inflation remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, which would make it less likely that the Fed will cut its key short-term interest rate. Trump has repeatedly urged the central bank to reduce borrowing costs.

Last week, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the inflation data, said it is reducing the amount of data it collects for each inflation report. Economists have expressed concern about the cutback, and while it isn't clear how sharp the reduction is, most analysts say it is likely to have a minor impact. Still, any reduction in data collection could make the figures more volatile.

Trump commented on the ruling on Wednesday on his social media site, saying, “A Federal Appeals Court has just ruled that the United States can use TARIFFS to protect itself against other countries. A great and important win for the U.S.,” he wrote.

Until recently, the Army's long-planned birthday celebration did not include a big parade. Added under the Trump administration, the event, featuring hundreds of military vehicles and aircraft and thousands of soldiers, has divided veterans.

Some liken it to the military chest-pounding commonly seen in North Korea, a step toward authoritarianism or a perverse birthday party for Trump.

Others see it as a once-in-a-lifetime accounting of the Army's achievements and the military service of millions of soldiers over centuries. The parade is not about Trump, they say, but the public seeing the faces of soldiers when so few Americans serve.

The Army expects up to 200,000 people could attend and says the parade will cost an estimated $25 million to $45 million.

Trump, speaking at Fort Bragg this week, said Saturday would be “a big day” and noted “we want to show off a little bit.”

The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit extends a similar ruling it made after another federal court struck down the tariffs May 28, saying Trump had overstepped his authority.

The case involves 10% tariffs the president imposed on almost every country in April and bigger ones he imposed and then suspended on countries with which the United States runs trade deficits. It also involves tariffs Trump plastered on imports from China, Canada and Mexico to pressure them to do more to stop the illegal flow of immigrants and synthetic opioids across the U.S. border.

In declaring the tariffs, Trump had invoked emergency powers under a 1977 law. But a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled he had exceeded his power.

The tariffs upended global trade, paralyzed businesses and spooked financial markets.

Early Wednesday morning, he posted “I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far.”

Musk's break with a president whom he spent hundreds of millions of dollars to elect appeared to put an end to his influence in the White House and prompted concerns about effects on his companies. As a major government contractor, Musk's businesses could be particularly vulnerable to retribution, and Trump has already threatened to cut Musk's contracts.

Musk earlier deleted a post in which he claimed without evidence that the government was concealing information about the president's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Meanwhile, other posts that irritated Trump, including ones in which Musk called the spending bill an “abomination” and claimed credit for Trump's election victory, remained live.

On Sunday, Trump told NBC's Kristen Welker that he has no desire to repair their relationship and warned that Musk could face “serious consequences” if he tries to help Democrats in upcoming elections.

Trump's quest to erase his criminal conviction heads to a federal appeals court Wednesday. It's one way he's trying to get last year's hush money verdict overturned.

A three-judge panel is set to hear arguments in Trump's long-running fight to get the New York case moved from state court to federal court, where he could then try to have the verdict thrown out on presidential immunity grounds.

The Republican is asking the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to intervene after a lower-court judge twice rejected the move. As part of the request, Trump wants the federal appeals court to seize control of the criminal case and then ultimately decide his appeal of the verdict, which is now pending in a state appellate court.

The Manhattan district attorney's office, which prosecuted Trump's case, wants it to stay in state court.

Los Angeles police swiftly enforced a downtown curfew Tuesday night, making arrests moments after it took effect, while deploying officers on horseback and using crowd control projectiles to break up a group of hundreds demonstrating against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued a curfew for downtown Los Angeles on Tuesday to stop vandalism and looting as protests over President Donald Trump's stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws continued in the city.

Several people protesting over immigration raids in Los Angeles were detained and loaded onto a police bus Monday evening as President Donald Trump ordered more National Guard troops to the city.

President Donald Trump has authorized the deployment of an additional 2,000 National Guard members to respond to immigration protests in Los Angeles, according to the Pentagon's chief spokesperson. Mayor Karen Bass criticized the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines as a “deliberate attempt” by the Trump administration to “create disorder and chaos in our city.”

Protests took place in pockets across Los Angeles over several days after the Trump administration stepped up immigration control efforts in the city. In an unprecedented move, U.S. President Donald Trump deployed National Guard troops, a move strongly criticised by the city's officials and the Governor of California Gavin Newsom.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Police arrested more than 20 people, mostly on curfew violations, on the first night of restrictions in downtown Los Angeles and used crowd-control projectiles to break up hundreds of protesters demonstrating against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, officials said Wednesday.

But there were fewer clashes between police and demonstrators than on previous nights, and by daybreak the downtown streets were bustling with residents walking dogs and commuters clutching coffee cups.

Officials said the curfew was necessary to stop vandalism and theft by agitators looking to cause trouble after five days of protests, which have mostly been concentrated downtown.

The curfew covers a 1-square-mile (2.5-square-kilometer) section that includes an area where protests have occurred since Friday in the sprawling city of 4 million. The city of Los Angeles encompasses roughly 500 square miles (1,295 square kilometers).

Some 2,000 National Guard soldiers are in the city, and about half of them have been protecting federal buildings and agents, said Army Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, head of Task Force 51, which is overseeing the deployment of National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles.

About 700 Marines will soon join the Guard troops, but they are still undergoing training and will not be mobilized Wednesday, Sherman said. Another 2,000 Guard troops should be on the streets by Thursday, he said.




Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has accused Trump of drawing a “military dragnet” across the nation's second-largest city with his escalating use of the National Guard, which Trump activated, along with the Marines, over the objections of city and state leaders.

Newsom asked a court to put an emergency stop to the military helping federal immigration agents. The assistance includes some guardsmen now standing protectively around agents as they carry out arrests.

The governor said the military presence would only heighten tensions and civil unrest. A judge set a hearing for Thursday, giving the administration several days to continue its activities.

The change moves the military closer to engaging in law enforcement actions such as deportations, as Trump has promised as part of his immigration crackdown. The Guard has the authority to temporarily detain people who attack officers, but any arrests would be made by law enforcement.

The president posted on the Truth Social platform that the city “would be burning to the ground” if he had not sent in the military.

Demonstrations have spread to other cities nationwide, including Dallas and Austin in Texas, and Chicago and New York, where thousands rallied and multiple arrests were made.

New York City police said they took 86 people into custody during protests in lower Manhattan from Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the vast majority of demonstrators were peaceful.

In Texas, where police in Austin used chemical irritants to disperse several hundred demonstrators Monday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's office said Texas National Guard troops were “on standby” in areas where demonstrations are planned.

Guard members were sent to San Antonio, but Police Chief William McManus said he had not been told how many troops were deployed or their role ahead of planned protests Wednesday night and Saturday.




Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass declared a local emergency and said the 8 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew is expected to last several days.

“We reached a tipping point” after 23 businesses were looted, Bass said Tuesday.

The curfew doesn't apply to residents who live in the designated area, people who are homeless, credentialed media or public safety and emergency officials, Police Chief Jim McDonnell said.




He said “unlawful and dangerous behavior” had been escalating since Saturday and that the curfew was needed to protect lives and property. 

Trump left open the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act, which authorizes the president to deploy military forces inside the U.S. to suppress rebellion or domestic violence or to enforce the law in certain situations. It's one of the most extreme emergency powers available to a U.S. president.

“If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We'll see,” he said from the Oval Office.

Later the president called protesters “animals” and “a foreign enemy” in a speech at Fort Bragg.

Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth.

In a public address Tuesday evening, Newsom called Trump's actions the start of an “assault” on democracy.

“California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next,” he said.

Newsom warned people against inciting violence, but he urged them to stand up to the president's actions.

The protests began Friday after federal immigration raids arrested dozens of workers in Los Angeles. Protesters blocked a major freeway and set cars on fire over the weekend, and police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades.

Thousands of people have peacefully rallied outside City Hall and hundreds more protested outside a federal complex that includes a detention center where some immigrants are being held following workplace raids.

Despite the protests, immigration enforcement activity has continued throughout the county, with city leaders and community groups reporting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement present at libraries, car washes and Home Depots. School graduations in Los Angeles have increased security over fears of ICE action, and some have offered parents the option to watch on Zoom.

Los Angeles police made 197 arrests on Tuesday, including 67 who were occupying a freeway, according to the city's chief. 

The majority of arrests since the protests began have been for failing to disperse, while a few others were for assault with a deadly weapon, looting, vandalism and attempted murder for tossing a Molotov cocktail. At least seven police officers have been injured.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said President Donald Trump is “pulling a military dragnet” across Los Angeles during a brief public address on Tuesday. The Democratic governor's remarks come after Trump ordered the deployment of nearly 5,000 troops, including National Guard and Marines, to the nation's second-largest city. They were deployed to protect federal buildings but are now also protecting immigration agents as they carry out arrests.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Calling President Donald Trump a threat to the American way of life, Gov. Gavin Newsom depicted the federal military intervention in Los Angeles as the onset of a much broader effort by Trump to overturn political and cultural norms at the heart of the nation's democracy.

In a speech Tuesday evening, the potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate said the arrival of National Guard and Marine troops in the city at Trump's direction was not simply about quelling protests that followed a series of immigration raids by federal authorities. Instead, he said, it was part of a calculated “war” intended to upend the foundations of society and concentrate power in the White House.

“California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next,” a somber Newsom warned, seated before the U.S. and California flags. “Democracy is next. Democracy is under assault before our eyes. This moment we have feared has arrived.”

As head of the heavily Democratic state known as the epicenter of the so-called Trump resistance, Newsom and the Republican president have long been adversaries. But the governor's speech delivered in prime time argued that Trump was not just a threat to democracy, but was actively working to break down its guardrails that reach back to the nation's founding.

″He's declared a war. A war on culture, on history, on science, on knowledge itself,” Newsom said. “He's delegitimizing news organizations, and he's assaulting the First Amendment.”




Newsom added that Trump is attacking law firms and the judicial branch — “the foundations of an orderly and civil society.”

“It's time for all of us to stand up,” Newsom said, urging any protests to be peaceful. “What Donald Trump wants most is your fealty, your silence, to be complicit in this moment. Do not give in to him.”

His speech came the same day that Newsom asked a court to put an emergency stop to the military helping federal immigration agents, with some guardsmen now standing in protective gauntlet around agents as they carried out arrests. The judge chose not to rule immediately, giving the Trump administration several days to continue those activities before a hearing Thursday. 

Trump has activated more than 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines over the objections of city and state leaders, though the Marines have not yet been spotted in Los Angeles and Guard troops have had limited engagement with protesters. They were originally deployed to protect federal buildings.

Newsom's speech capped several days of acidic exchanges between Trump and Newsom, that included the president appearing to endorse Newsom's arrest if he interfered with federal immigration enforcement. “I think it's great. Gavin likes the publicity, but I think it would be a great thing,” Trump told reporters.

Over the years, Trump has threatened to intercede in California's long-running homeless crisis, vowed to withhold federal wildfire aid as political leverage in a dispute over water rights, called on police to shoot people robbing stores and warned residents that “your children are in danger” because of illegal immigration.

Trump relishes insulting the two-term governor and former San Francisco mayor — frequently referring to him as Gov. “New-scum” — and earlier this year faulted the governor for Southern California's deadly wildfires. 

Trump has argued that the city was in danger of being overrun by violent protesters, while Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass have called the federal intervention an unneeded — and potentially dangerous — overreaction.

The demonstrations have been mostly concentrated in the city's downtown hub. Demonstrations have spread to other cities in the state and nationwide, including Dallas and Austin, Texas, Chicago and New York City, where a thousand people rallied and multiple arrests were made.

Trump left open the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act, which authorizes the president to deploy military forces inside the U.S. to suppress rebellion or domestic violence or to enforce the law in certain situations. It's one of the most extreme emergency powers available to a U.S. president.

“If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We'll see,” he said from the Oval Office.

BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Lawyers for President Donald Trump's administration say he has the authority to abolish national monuments meant to protect historical and archaeological sites across broad landscapes, including two in California created by his predecessor at the request of Native American tribes.

A Justice Department legal opinion released Tuesday disavowed a 1938 determination that monuments created by previous presidents under the Antiquities Act can't be revoked. The department said presidents can cancel monument designations if protections aren't warranted.

The finding comes as the Interior Department under Trump weighs changes to monuments across the nation as part of the administration's push to expand U.S. energy production.

Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Natural Resources Committee, said that at Trump's order, “his Justice Department is attempting to clear a path to erase national monuments.”

Trump in his first term reduced the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante National Monuments in Utah, calling them a “massive land grab.” He also lifted fishing restrictions within a sprawling marine monument off the New England Coast.

Former President Joe Biden reversed the moves and restored the monuments.

The two monuments singled out in the newly released Justice Department opinion were designated by Biden in his final days in office: Chuckwalla National Monument, in Southern California near Joshua Tree National Park, and Sáttítla Highlands National Monument, in Northern California.




The Democrat's declarations for the monuments barred oil and natural gas drilling and mining on the 624,000-acre (2,400-square-kilometer) Chuckwalla site, and the roughly 225,000 acres (800 square kilometers) Sáttítla Highlands site near the California-Oregon border. 

Chuckwalla has natural wonders including the Painted Canyon of Mecca Hills and Alligator Rock, and is home to rare species of plants and animals like the desert bighorn sheep and the Chuckwalla lizard. The Sáttítla Highlands include the ancestral homelands of the Pit River Tribe and Modoc Peoples.

All but three presidents have used the 1906 Antiquities Act to protect unique landscapes and cultural resources. About half the national parks in the U.S. were first designated as monuments. 

But critics of monument designations under Biden and Obama say the protective boundaries were stretched too far, hindering mining for critical minerals.

Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lanora Pettit wrote in the Trump administration opinion that Biden's protections of Chuckwalla and the Sattítla Highlands were part of the Democrat's attempts to create for himself an environmental legacy that includes more places to hike, bike, camp or hunt. 

“Such activities are entirely expected in a park, but they are wholly unrelated to (if not outright incompatible with) the protection of scientific or historical monuments,” Pettit wrote.

Trump in April lifted commercial fishing prohibitions within an expansive marine monument in the Pacific Ocean created under former President Barack Obama.

Environmental groups said Tuesday's Justice Department opinion doesn't give him the authority to shrink monuments at will.

“Americans overwhelmingly support our public lands and oppose seeing them dismantled or destroyed,” said Axie Navas with The Wilderness Society.

Biden established 10 new monuments, among them the site of a 1908 race riot in Springfield, Illinois, and another on a sacred Native American site near the Grand Canyon.

Since 1912, presidents have issued more than a dozen proclamations that diminished monuments, according to a National Park Service database.

Dwight Eisenhower was most active in undoing the proclamations of his predecessors as he diminished six monuments, including Arches in Utah, Great Sand Dunes in Colorado and Glacier Bay in Alaska, which have all since become national parks.

Trump's moves to shrink the Utah monuments in his first term were challenged by environmental groups that said protections for the sites safeguard water supplies and wildlife while preserving cultural sites.

The reductions were reversed by Biden before the case was resolved, and it remains pending. 

President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act after lobbying by educators and scientists who wanted to protect sites from artifact looting and haphazard collecting by individuals. It was the first law in the U.S. to establish legal protections for cultural and natural resources of historic or scientific interest on federal lands.

YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) — A bison gored a man Tuesday after a large group of visitors got too close to the animal in Yellowstone National Park, officials said.

The 30-year-old from Randolph, New Jersey, was treated for minor injuries after being gored around 9:45 a.m. in the Old Faithful area, according to a park statement.

Park officials didn't release the man's name or condition, saying what happened was under investigation and no more information was available for release.

He was the second person gored by a bison already this spring in Yellowstone. A 47-year-old Cape Coral, Florida, man had minor injuries after being gored in the Lake Village area May 7.

Bison gored at least two people in Yellowstone last year including an 83-year-old South Carolina woman who was seriously injured. A bison gored an Arizona woman in the park in 2023.

Yellowstone bison injured two people in 2022.

Bison have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other wild animal. They can run up to 35 mph (56 kph), faster than the men's world record in the 100-meter dash.

Standing up to 6 feet (2 meters) tall and weighing up to 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms), they are North America's biggest land animal.

Park regulations require visitors to keep at least 25 yards (22.86 meters) away from bison and other large herbivores and 100 yards (91 meters) away from wolves and bears.

Fox News Digital spoke to Hudson Institute's Michael Sobolik about the growing CCP threat to the U.S.

FIRST ON FOX: A national security-focused nonprofit organization has released a comprehensive report detailing the workings of a well-funded nominally U.S.-based organization that it says is undermining American energy, pushing left-wing green initiatives and ultimately advancing Chinese interests.

The report, published by State Armor, outlines the money trail of Energy Foundation China (EFC), registered as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that is technically headquartered in San Francisco but with employees mostly based in Beijing.

""Energy Foundation China used to be known as the Energy Foundation before it spun off most of its U.S.-based operations in 2019 into a separate organization called the U.S. Energy Foundation,"" the report explains. ""While still formally organized as the Energy Foundation, since 2019, the organization has used the alias ‘Energy Foundation China' or ‘EF China' to differentiate from the now-separate U.S. Energy Foundation. The group was founded by Hal Harvey, a climate activist and entrepreneur with deep ties to numerous left-wing organizations and to China.""

State Armor found that EFC has ""spent millions each year to bankroll climate advocates who promote phasing out fossil fuels and implementing green energy alternatives like the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) and Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the latter of which was the target of a 2018 Congressional inquiry into whether it should register as a foreign agent based on its Chinese funding.""

The Rocky Mountain Institute produced one of the most prominent studies used by many Democrats to justify cutting down on gas stoves and was cited by President Joe Biden's Department of Energy. 

Earlier this year, multiple committees joined to begin an investigation into EFC, and requested files from EFC President Zi Chou about financial resources given to American organizations after Fox News Digital reporting on the group funneling millions of dollars to fund climate initiatives and environmental groups in the U.S.

The report details how EFC ""led a U.S. state-level legislative drive"" against Bayer, the leading Western fertilizer company, that pushed for lawsuits against the company over a potentially carcinogenic pesticide with the aim of driving the company out of the U.S. and in turn forcing reliance on Chinese suppliers. 

The report goes on to outline how the organization has ""provided millions"" to the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) to support ""a clean energy future"" and how ICCT was an ""active supporter"" of climate initiatives in the Inflation Reduction Act targeting increased battery electric trucking infrastructure. 

Fox News Digital reported in 2023 that The Energy Foundation sent $480,000 to the Washington, D.C.-based International Council on Clean Transportation, which advocates for widespread EV adoption and policies decarbonizing the transportation sector broadly. It also wired grants — one to the University of Maryland and another to the Jackson Hole Center for Global Affairs — worth a total of $450,000 and earmarked for projects to phase out coal power reliance.

BOMBSHELL REPORT SUGGESTS 'CHINESE SPIES' INFILTRATING PRESTIGIOUS US UNIVERSITY: 'WIDESPREAD CAMPAIGN'

Josh Hodges, commissioner of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission and former national security advisor to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and NSC senior director in the first Trump administration, told Fox News Digital that EFC is a ""textbook example of the CCP's asymmetric warfare strategy and drive to deepen its dominance over American companies.""

""Communist China is manipulating a supposed philanthropic network to steer the U.S. away from reliable domestic energy sources and into dependence on Chinese supply chains,"" Hodges said. ""Whether it's solar panels, mobile phones, electric vehicle batteries, or agricultural chemicals, Beijing's fingerprints are all over the 'green transition' being pushed on America.""

The report quotes Chinese climate envoy Liu Zhenmin, who suggested that Biden's green energy policies will remain even under a more skeptical Trump administration and said, ""even if the new Trump administration reverses climate change policies, it is unlikely to completely change the green transition actions that have already begun in various parts of the U.S.""

""In other words, the CCP's penetration of the U.S.' political and industrial systems runs so deep that CCP officials believe that not even a skeptical White House could halt America's growing dependence upon Chinese technologies,"" the report states.

Will Hild, executive director of Consumers' Research, told Fox News Digital that the report ""exposes a disturbing truth"" that EFC is part of a broader push to undermine American energy independence and ""stifle"" the Trump energy agenda to benefit the CCP. 

""EFC is weaponizing woke ideology to pull off this scheme and force American consumers to rely on the Chinese Communist Party for energy sources,"" Hild said. ""Americans deserve to know the truth about our foreign adversary's campaign that is poisoning our economy and reshaping our energy future. We applaud organizations like State Armor that are working to expose these grifts against consumers.""

In addition to the EFC's climate activism, the report focuses on how, by ""co-opting climate activism and dominating new so-called green supply chains, Beijing converts a domestic weakness into a global strength"" while also detailing the ties between EFC and the CCP. 

For example, EFC's CEO Zou Ji has served in previous roles at top leadership positions in China's official National Center for Climate Change Strategy within the National Development and Reform Commission of the State Council. 

""He was so deeply tied into CCP leadership that he was included as a part of China's delegation to the 2015 Paris Climate Talks,"" the report says. ""Zou's other affiliations include a position at Tsinghua University at a center where his colleagues include a retired senior PLA officer and a former deputy director of an MSS think tank.""

Zou is not the only EFC figure with ties to the CCP, the report says, pointing to EFC board member and Washington, D.C.-based attorney Hongjun Zhang, who serves as a member of China's Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development and was previously a legislative director for the China National People's Congress. 

Zhang, according to his law firm's bio page, spent ""many years in the Chinese government"" that included work at the ""Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), State Food and Drug Administration (CFDA), Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), and National Development and Reform Commission."" 

The report states that EFC's operations in China are overseen by the CCP's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and that the organization's Beijing headquarters are located in a building owned by a state-owned investment corporation tied to Chinese state media propaganda.

John Moolenaar, R-Mich., who is the chairman of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, sounded the alarm over the report, telling Fox News Digital, ""This report confirms what we've long warned: the Chinese Communist Party is using seemingly innocuous nonprofits to influence American policy and undermine U.S. interests — in this case, our energy independence.""

""Energy Foundation China operates at the direction of the CCP and is exploiting our charitable system to push policies that benefit Beijing, not the American people,"" Moolenaar continued. ""The Select Committee continues to investigate how CCP-linked organizations infiltrate U.S. institutions, shift critical supply chains toward China, and shape environmental agendas that aim to make America weaker while China gets stronger. We will continue to expose these influence operations and work with Congress and the administration to safeguard U.S. energy security and national sovereignty.""

The report also points to examples of EFC collaborating with U.S. entities and officials, including in 2023 when it ""provided support"" for an event that featured California Gov. Gavin Newsom during a visit to China and then hosted a forum a month later for a discussion promoting ""low-carbon cooperation between the two nations.""

Vance Wagner, the vice president for strategic partnerships at Energy Foundation China, pushed back on the report, telling Fox News Digital, ""Energy Foundation China (EFC) is an independent grantmaking charitable organization that provides funding for research and capacity building related to climate change and China.""

""Climate change is one of the greatest threats facing our world. Our work is currently focused on China given the scale of its energy sector and its role in global emissions. Despite geopolitical tensions, meaningful engagement with China on climate change and emissions reductions is in everyone's interests,"" Wagner continued. ""All grants we make support projects related to climate change and China, and are in no way related to influencing U.S. energy policy. EFC does not accept funding from any government or political party.""

""Neither the Chinese government nor the CCP fund, direct, or control EFC or our grant-making decisions,"" he added. ""We are compliant with all U.S. and Chinese laws and regulations and do not lobby or support electoral activities in any country.""

The report states that between 2020 and 2021, EFC gave over $1 million to the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for funding ""green energy research"" and laboratory training increasing the efficiency of China's industrial sectors. 

The Biden administration, according to the report, gave $60 million in grants to the Institute for Sustainable Communities, which is a group ""frequently in collaboration with Energy Foundation China.""

""America's energy security is national security,"" Jason Isaac, CEO of American Energy Institute, told Fox News Digital.

""The State Armor report lays bare how the Chinese Communist Party has co-opted climate activism to shift the U.S. onto so-called ‘green' technologies that are manufactured, mined, and controlled by China. From solar panels to EV batteries and rare earth minerals, our supply chains are increasingly entangled with a foreign adversary that uses forced labor, ignores environmental safeguards, and openly aims to dominate the global energy future. This isn't progress — it's dependence. Real energy dominance means leveraging America's vast domestic energy resources, not outsourcing our future to Beijing.""

Along with the report, State Armor has sent letters to Republican committee chairs in Congress that call for prompt oversight on the matter. 

""Congress must act,"" the letter, authored by Lucci, implores. ""Oversight is urgently needed to expose the full extent of this operation, beginning with Energy Foundation China. The EFC is not a passive observer; it is an active player in a geopolitical contest where America's energy security and global leadership hang in the balance.""

Jason Miller and Meghan Hays discuss President Trump's decision to send the National Guard to Los Angeles, comments made by Dem leaders, immigration policy reform and more on ‘America Reports.'

President Donald Trump quickly reacted to fledgling riots in Los Angeles County over the weekend by activating the National Guard, a response that drew comparisons to the summer of 2020, when widespread violence and destruction arose from Black Lives Matter and Antifa riots.

Trump's decision to federalize 4,100 National Guard soldiers and deploy hundreds of Marines came in the face of forceful objections from Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is now suing Trump over the move. Trump's deputies, however, say the National Guard was a necessary step to quash riots lest they reach the scale of the ones that occurred across the country in the aftermath of George Floyd's death on May 25, 2020.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Trump's decision would prevent a scenario like the one in Minnesota that year, when Democratic Gov. Tim Walz waited two days to call upon the National Guard to address unrest in his state.

""That's one of the reasons why these National Guard soldiers have been federalized, so they can use their special skill set to keep peace,"" Noem said in a recent television interview. ""We're not going to let a repeat of 2020 happen, and if you remember, it all happened in Tim Walz's state, in Minneapolis… and Governor Tim Walz made very bad decisions.""

Walz tried to get Trump to ""bail him out"" after the governor ""let his city burn for days on end,"" Noem said.

Walz activated the National Guard in Minnesota on May 28, after looting and arson had already cropped up in the state in response to Floyd's death. Within hours of Walz announcing he had mobilized National Guard soldiers, rioters set ablaze Minneapolis' Third Precinct police station.

Although Walz ended up activating Minnesota's entire National Guard, his hesitancy prompted Trump to threaten on May 29 to federalize the soldiers ""to get the job done right.""

By May 30, Minnesota's National Guard announced that the governor had fully mobilized it, marking the ""largest domestic deployment"" in its history.

During these riots, Trump was far more deferential to governors, several of whom saw their cities ravaged by rioting, looting, arson, violence and death. The Democratic governors struggled at times to balance a law-and-order posture with their sympathy for those frustrated by police brutality.

The National Guard is a military force based in each state, and governors and presidents have shared authority over it. Governors typically have purview over their respective National Guard units, but presidents can call them into federal service in certain scenarios.

On June 3, 2020, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., pressured the Trump administration in a New York Times op-ed to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would allow the president to federalize the National Guard. The prospect was so controversial at the time that the newspaper retracted the op-ed, citing fierce blowback from its readers.

By June 4, governors in 32 states and Washington, D.C., activated a total of more than 32,000 National Guard soldiers as the chaos transpired across the country.

DHS Deputy Secretary Troy Edgar echoed Noem's remarks in a statement online on Monday, saying Trump moved so quickly because he did not want the same level of violence and damage as in 2020.

Trump and Noem ""will not allow violent radicals to intimidate and shut down law enforcement in LA,"" Edgar said. ""This isn't the Summer of 2020 2.0. I thank the brave men and women of the National Guard defending federal buildings so that immigration officials can keep us safe.""

Ohio GOP gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy calls out the riots in Los Angeles on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'

Vivek Ramaswamy said he sees parallels between California Gov. Gavin Newsom and another controversial Democratic governor who literally stood in the way of the National Guard and had well-known presidential ambitions.

Newsom is beginning to ""resemble"" former Alabama Gov. George Wallace in several aspects of his response to Los Angeles' riots, Ramaswamy claimed Tuesday on Fox News' ""Jesse Watters Primetime.""

The Ohio gubernatorial candidate noted how Wallace – an avowed segregationist who ran for president four times – forced the hand of President John F. Kennedy by preventing Black students from attending the University of Alabama.

""[Newsom's] behavior is starting to resemble that of another Democratic governor from U.S. history by the name of George Wallace, who was the governor of Alabama, who famously stood in the way of federal desegregation,"" Ramaswamy said.

MAXINE WATERS TAUNTS ARMED AGENTS AFTER FEDS SLAM DOOR ON HER DURING LA RIOTS: ‘YOU BETTER SHOOT STRAIGHT'

""The parallels are actually pretty striking, if you think about it: Democrat governors, when you look at George Wallace, he resisted desegregation. Gavin Newsom is resisting deportations. George Wallace wanted segregated cities. Gavin Newsom wants sanctuary cities. George Wallace stood in the school door, blocking the way. Gavin Newsom is blocking the ICE vans. It's the same Democrat-governor playbook.""

The former DOGE co-leader said both Newsom and Wallace ""dodge[d] the feds and rall[ied] the radicals.""

""What they were both doing is really carving their Democratic primary path for their presidential ambitions,"" he added.

""Gavin Newsom's presidential ambitions are going to end in the same place that George Wallace's did: In the dustbin of history where it belongs.""

In June 1963, Wallace prevented two Black students – Vivian Malone and James Hood – from enrolling on the Tuscaloosa campus of the University of Alabama and made his infamous ""stand in the schoolhouse door.""

NEWSOM SAYS LOS ANGELES RIOTERS WILL BE PROSECUTED, SLAMS TRUMP FOR 'TRAUMATIZING OUR COMMUNITIES'

After Wallace refused Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach's order to step aside, he delivered a pro-states-rights speech and did not budge.

Kennedy federalized the Yellowhammer State's National Guard under the Insurrection Act. Gen. Henry Graham personally confronted Wallace, who ultimately relented.

The next year, Wallace primaried President Lyndon Johnson and notably won a few northern states he had targeted on his segregationist platform – but lost to the incumbent.

In 1968, he tried again on the American Independent line with a counter-civil-rights message – splitting the Democratic vote, winning five states and helping ultimate victor Richard Nixon. During his 1976 run, he apologized for his past support for segregation.

This week, Newsom objected to President Donald Trump's federalization of the California National Guard and the ensuing deployment of 700 Marines to Los Angeles to assist in riot response.

Late Tuesday, Clinton-appointed federal Judge Charles Breyer rejected a Newsom request to block Trump's military deployments.

Newsom continued to lambaste Trump, saying in a video statement Tuesday that, ""authoritarian regimes begin by targeting people who are least able to defend themselves, but they do not stop there.""

Newsom also took heat for his riot response strategy from some famous Los Angeles residents, including actor Jon Voight.

""You fool,"" Voight fumed in an X video posted early Wednesday. 

""They [the rioters] would burn you down like they are burning the cars and the American flag.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Newsom for comment but did not immediately hear back.

Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how President Donald Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to LA helped quell the violence as California officials continue resistance. 

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has deployed National Guard troops across the state ahead of more anti-ICE protests.

Abbott announced the move early Wednesday in a post on X as protests sprang up in parts of Texas and across the U.S. this week.

""Texas National Guard will be deployed to locations across the state to ensure peace & order,"" Abbott wrote in the post. ""Peaceful protest is legal. Harming a person or property is illegal & will lead to arrest. @TexasGuard will use every tool & strategy to help law enforcement maintain order.""

The governor's press secretary, Andrew Mahaleris, told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement that troops would be sent to areas where mass protests are planned.

""The State of Texas stands ready to deploy all necessary personnel and resources to uphold law and order across our state,"" Mahaleris said. ""Texas National Guard soldiers are on standby in areas where mass demonstrations are planned in case they are needed. Peaceful protests are part of the fabric of our nation, but Texas will not tolerate the lawlessness we have seen in Los Angeles. Anyone engaging in acts of violence or damaging property will be swiftly held accountable to the full extent of the law.""

San Antonio Police Department Assistant Chief Jesse Salame told WOAI-TV that Chief William McManus confirmed the deployment of National Guard troops to the city, though he added that ""we don't have any additional details about their deployment.""

Major demonstrations popped up in cities across Texas this week on the heels of violent riots in Los Angeles to protest federal immigration raids.

In Austin, four police officers were injured trying to disperse a crowd of several hundred demonstrators that moved between the state Capitol and a federal building that houses an ICE office on Monday night. Austin police used pepper spray balls and state police used tear gas when demonstrators began trying to deface the federal building with spray paint.

Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis said three officers were injured when individuals began hurling ""very large"" rocks, while a fourth suffered a shoulder injury during an arrest.

""We support peaceful protest,"" Davis said. ""When that protest turns violent, when it turns to throwing rocks and bottles ... that will not be tolerated. Arrests will be made.""

Austin police arrested eight people, and state police arrested five more.

A New Jersey tourist was gored by a bison at Yellowstone National Park after a large group of visitors approached the animal too closely, officials said. 

The 30-year-old man from Randolph was struck around 9:45 a.m. Tuesday in the Upper Geyser Basin at Old Faithful, according to the National Park Service (NPS). 

""The individual sustained minor injuries and was treated and transported by emergency medical personnel,"" it said. 

The incident is the second time this year a person has been injured by a bison at Yellowstone.

In the first incident on May 4, a 47-year-old tourist from Cape Coral, Fla., was gored by a bison ""after he approached it too closely"" in the Lake Village area, the NPS said.  

That man suffered minor injuries as well.

Park officials said, ""Wild animals can be aggressive if people don't respect their space"" and ""It is your responsibility to stay more than 25 yards away from all large animals -- bison, elk, bighorn sheep, deer, moose, and coyotes -- and at least 100 yards away from bears, wolves, and cougars."" 

""If wildlife approach you, move away to always maintain these safe viewing distances,"" the NPS continued. ""Bison will defend their space when threatened and have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal. They are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans.""

The ICE raids in California, and the Trump administration's decision to deploy National Guard troops, to Los Angeles, touched off a wave of demonstrations and arrests other U.S. cities.

Thousands of people amassed in major U.S. cities this week to protest President Donald Trump's immigration raids in Los Angeles – injecting fresh uncertainty in the nation's capital and beyond just days before Washington, D.C., hosts a massive, first-of-its-kind military parade. 

It is unclear what, if any, major demonstrations protesters are planning in coordination with Saturday's military parade; a $45 million event running through the city's downtown which will feature hundreds of military vehicles, including armored troop carriers, tanks and Chinook helicopters, winding through the city's roads and skies in celebration of the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary.

It also happens to be Trump's 79th birthday. 

However, the show of force and military grandeur takes place at a time when a wave of immigration protests in California – and Trump's attempts to quash the unrest by deploying thousands of U.S. troops to the state – have changed the national mood from tense to combustible, prompting a new wave of demonstrations and clashes with law enforcement in major cities across the U.S.

Combined, the escalating skirmishes have also raised the specter of possible disruption during the patriotic parade, though officials stressed this week that they are closely monitoring the event and security in the surrounding area.

An immigration protest in Washington, D.C., on Monday afternoon was notably tame. However, the crowd was massive, drawing hundreds of protesters to the city's downtown area. Other demonstrations are slated to take place in the Washington, D.C.-area throughout the week, including a planned demonstration in the nearby Columbia Heights neighborhood. 

U.S. Park Police told reporters this week that they are tracking nine planned protests in Washington, D.C., on Saturday. 

Trump, for his part, attempted to get ahead of any protests that could snarl the planned display of military might, warning that any demonstrators that attempted to disrupt the event ""will be met with very heavy force.""

""I haven't even heard about a protest, but [there are] people that hate our country,"" he told reporters Tuesday afternoon.

All the same, major protests continued to crop up this week in other major U.S. cities, and clashes with law enforcement personnel prompted dozens of arrests in New York and in various Texas cities, according to local law enforcement officials.

In Washington, D.C., protesters massed peacefully outside the Justice Department headquarters on Monday to protest the administration's immigration crackdown and ICE raids.

Many were also there to demand the release of a prominent labor leader, David Huerta, who was arrested in the Los Angeles protests late last week. Huerta, the president of California's Service Employees International Union (SEIU) chapter, was hospitalized due to injuries sustained during his arrest, according to the union.

Huerta was released Monday evening on bail. He has since been charged with felony conspiracy to impede an officer, which carries a maximum penalty of up to six years in federal prison.

""We're sick and tired of the illegal acts of the administration,"" Jaime Contreras, the executive vice president of SEIU's Capital Area District chapter, told Fox News Digital in an interview, pointing to the administration's arrest of Huerta and also the arrest of ""so many innocent immigrants"" in the U.S. who have been swept up in ICE raids. 

""All they want is to provide a better life for their family, which is why your ancestors came to this country,"" he said.

The group, which included labor and union groups, among other protesters, marched past the Justice Department entrance and the FBI's headquarters downtown, chanting and holding signs. The demonstrators yelled, ""Pam Bondi, shame on you!"" as they gathered outside the entrance to the building. 

Nearby, employees at the J. Edgar Hoover Building – which since the 1970s has served as the FBI's national headquarters – could be seen watching the demonstration unfold from the confines of the building's infamously brutalist-style balconies.

""I have one word for you today – enough,"" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-WA, who spoke at the demonstration in Washington, D.C., on Monday. ""Enough of these mass ICE raids that are sweeping up innocent people of every legal status, tearing apart families and our communities.""

The Washington, D.C., protest also took place on the same day that the Trump administration's wider travel ban officially took hold. The ban prohibits nationals from 12 countries from traveling to the U.S. and imposes partial restrictions on nationals from seven additional countries. 

Some at the demonstration told Fox News Digital they had deep concerns about the chilling effect that the ban could have on migrants in the U.S., including individuals that have already submitted visas from now-banned countries on the list.

Ultimately, Contreras told Fox News of the large crowd of protesters, ""I think people are angry.""

""I think that people are getting sick and tired of being threatened, of the fear factors that are being used against our community,"" he said.

""So yes, people are afraid— but people are also angry. And angry is a great organizing tool for all.""

Beyond Washington, the demonstrations and skirmishes add heat to an already fast-boiling standoff, as both the Trump administration and many protesters have said they have no plans to stand down from the fight. 

""We'll be back,"" some protesters chanted on Monday.

Meanwhile, Trump officials took to social media to condemn the wave of new protests, with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem noting that ICE, which falls under her department's purview, will ""continue to enforce the law.""

""If you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" she vowed.

President Donald Trump and Republicans are putting Democrats in the difficult political position of having to defend protests over illegal immigrants as the White House tries to project strength with the president's deployment of the National Guard to respond to the Los Angeles riots.

In an echo of their reaction to the Department of Government Efficiency's federal government reforms, Democrats are having to provide a nuanced defense of protests, which became violent last weekend, over Immigration and Customs Enforcement workplace raids in Los Angeles.

And, in the words popularized by former President Ronald Reagan, “If you're explaining, you're losing.”

Democrats' conundrum is twofold. First, Trump's immigration crackdown is popular, arguably less so in California, but popular in the aggregate across the country. Secondly, some Democrats, including those speculated to be 2028 presidential candidates, are calling on the party to be less “woke” after the 2020 racially charged unrest following the death of George Floyd while he was in police custody.

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), a likely 2028 candidate, has dominated the political spotlight amid the riots, particularly after Trump encouraged border czar Tom Homan to arrest him. Newsom and California Attorney General Rob Bonta have mounted a legal challenge against Trump, but it has been Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, embattled after her bungled management of this year's deadly wildfires, who has been most pressed on the immigration component of Democrats' problem.

“I want to share the CBS poll. It shows 54% of Americans approve of the Trump administration's program to deport illegal immigrants. A minority, 46%, disapprove,” CNN anchor Pamela Brown told Bass in an interview before asking, “Are Democrats out of touch on this issue?”

Bass said, “People might approve that policy, but do people really approve of the federal government coming in and seizing power from a state and from a city? I do not believe that Americans support the federal intervention and a city takeover or a state takeover.”

Rep. David Valadao (D-CA) has also tried to strike a balance on immigration, encouraging ICE “to prioritize the removal of known criminals over the hardworking people who have lived peacefully in [California's Central] Valley for years.”

I remain concerned about ongoing ICE operations throughout CA and will continue my conversations with the administration—urging them to prioritize the removal of known criminals over the hardworking people who have lived peacefully in the Valley for years.https://t.co/gqsDBO988j

Regarding concerns with woke-ism, Democrats, in conversations with the Washington Examiner, have underscored the difference between peaceful and violent protests as they try to express support for the former while condemning the latter.

“We all condemn the violence and burning of cars,” Rep. Luz Rivas (D-CA) told the Washington Examiner. “If people are committing crimes, they should be arrested during a protest.”

However, Rivas added that a campaign aide of hers who took part in one of the protests in Los Angeles was sprayed with tear gas “without any incident from the group.”

“The National Guard is trying to instigate the violence, just their presence,” she said. 

During a press conference, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), along with many other California Democrats, amplified Rivas's point, reiterating that Democrats “do not want any violent protest” and alleging that those responsible for the violence are most likely outside agitators, not anti-immigration enforcement demonstrators. 

“When there is a gathering, a large gathering of people, the anarchists see it as an opportunity, and they move in,” Pelosi said Tuesday. “[We] always have to be careful, whether you see a burned car, a broken window, or whatever it is — it may be the exuberance of the moment, but it may be the anarchist setting in.”

Rep. Mike Levin (D-CA) added, “We strongly condemn the agitators who are committing acts of violence. Their behavior is completely unacceptable. You're giving people like Stephen Miller exactly the images that they want, and that makes it even easier to then pick a fight over political retribution.”

Others, including Rep. Gil Cisneros (D-CA), have downplayed reports of looting, contending Trump and Republicans are “just trying to play up the situation into something that it is not to justify his means, of sending out the National Guard, of bringing in Marines, because he wants to instigate a confrontation so that he can go out and declare the Insurrection Act or declare martial law.”

To that end, Trump has indicated his willingness to invoke the Insurrection Act, which could be used to widen the scope of the deployment of the National Guard and Marines in Los Angeles to help the city's police officers and ICE agents with the protests, which started on Friday. On Monday, Trump ordered about 700 Marines to California and another 2,000 National Guard members. This brought the total number of National Guard members in the area to 4,000. None of these actions were taken in coordination with Newsom or Bass, which is the basis of Newsom's lawsuit.

You sent your troops here without fuel, food, water or a place to sleep.Here they are — being forced to sleep on the floor, piled on top of one another. If anyone is treating our troops disrespectfully, it is you @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/4i8VIiYZLr pic.twitter.com/sUYD2KHu6O

“If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We'll see. But I can tell you, last night was terrible. The night before that was terrible,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “If we didn't get involved, right now Los Angeles would be burning just like it was burning a number of months ago, with all the houses that were lost. Los Angeles right now would be on fire, and we have it in great shape. I'm not playing around.”

Trump also previewed similar ICE workplace raids in other cities in the coming days, weeks, and months, warning people who are considering organizing more protests that they will “be met with equal or greater force than we met right here.”

Democrats were already on defense regarding the Los Angeles riots, given Trump's positive polling on immigration and law and order. They are also on defense after Trump and the White House went on the offense following several negative headlines regarding last week's public breakdown of Trump's relationship with Elon Musk and resignations that the “one big, beautiful” bill may not pass the Senate by Independence Day.

“Donald Trump has lost total control inside the White House — his signature bill is despised by nearly everyone, and his very public breakup with Elon is a national embarrassment,” Democratic National Committee Deputy Communications Director Abhi Rahman told the Washington Examiner. “Now he thinks he can regain control by turning California into a military battlefield. This is a disturbing sideshow of political theatrics that will get people hurt on America's own soil.”

However, as Democrats continue to struggle with how to message against Trump, former Republican National Committee Communications Director Doug Heye told the Washington Examiner the party is overthinking its strategy to its detriment.

“Newsom has it right — Trump wants chaos because he thrives on it and he's betting that he'll get credit for ending this,” Heye said. “So don't set things on fire — and don't be scared to criticize those who do. Life ain't hard sometimes.”

Democrats encountered the same dynamic earlier in Trump's second administration when they sought to defend federal government employees dismissed by DOGE while opposing fraud and waste, again, explaining a nuanced position.

When Musk's DOGE efforts were at their most frenetic, former Biden administration aide Andrew Bates urged Democrats to acknowledge that “fraud and waste are real” and the party is “overwhelmingly against both.” 

“It's a mistake for some in the party to oppose the goal of DOGE itself,” Bates told the Washington Examiner at the time. “We need to be clear we are eager to cut fat and deny Republicans the false contrast they want, then blast the harm Musk is causing to real people by using a chainsaw instead of a scalpel — like putting military families through hell, making it impossible for Americans to get through to Social Security, or firing the staff who keep nukes secure.”

Trump made it clear at a rally at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on Tuesday that he has no intention of backing down in Los Angeles.

“As the entire world can now see, uncontrolled migration leads to chaos, dysfunction, and disorder,” Trump said. 

“Very simply, we will liberate Los Angeles and make it free, clean, and safe again,” he added.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump is set to take another swing at overturning the only criminal conviction ever handed down to a sitting U.S. president, as a federal appeals court is set to hear arguments Wednesday over whether his New York hush money case should have been removed from state court.

The hearing before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan marks the latest turn in People of the State of New York v. Trump, the unprecedented case that resulted in 34 felony convictions for falsifying business records. While Trump received an unconditional discharge and avoided jail time, the conviction has continued to haunt his presidency — symbolically if not practically.

Trump was sentenced on Jan. 10 by New York Judge Juan Merchan, who issued an unconditional discharge, meaning the then-president-elect would receive no prison time, probation, or further penalties. The sentencing, which came just days before Trump retook office, underscored the historic nature of his conviction as the first president to enter the White House with a felony record still intact.

Now back in office for a second term, Trump is seeking a federal forum, rather than a state court, to argue that the prosecution was not only politically motivated but also constitutionally flawed.

The legal theory behind the appeal hinges on a renewed claim that the conduct at the center of the case — the alleged falsification of checks reimbursing attorney Michael Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels — involved official acts taken during Trump's first term in the White House.

Trump's lawyers are asking the appellate panel to reverse the prior rulings of U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, who twice rejected attempts to remove the case to federal court, ruling that the conduct was “private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority.” In their latest filing, Trump's team argued that Hellerstein's conclusions are outdated in light of the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Trump v. United States last year, which held that presidents enjoy presumptive immunity for official acts.

Leading the charge this time is Jeff Wall, a former acting solicitor general and Supreme Court advocate with Sullivan & Cromwell. He replaces Trump's trial attorneys, Emil Bove and Todd Blanche, who now hold senior positions in the Trump administration. Blanche, who once resigned from his law firm to represent Trump, now serves as deputy attorney general. Bove, who helped handle Trump's cross-examination of Cohen, has been nominated to a federal appeals court seat.

Wall will argue that the case should have been removed from state court under the federal officer removal statute, citing Supremacy Clause concerns and saying Trump was targeted by “hostile local officials,” including Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, an elected Democrat, and Judge Juan Merchan. Trump's team described the prosecution as “an unprecedented and baseless” effort to take down a sitting president, driven by political animus and facilitated by a biased judiciary.

Bragg's office maintains that the case is closed — literally. In its brief filed in January, prosecutors argued that “removal is unavailable once final judgment has been entered in the state proceeding,” and that Trump is too late to pursue this strategy. Removal, it contends, is a pretrial mechanism intended to protect federal officials from state court litigation before a verdict is rendered.

“This case is over,” Bragg's team said.

However, Trump's attorneys said the matter remains alive because the conviction is still on the books — and because it implicates unsettled constitutional questions about federal supremacy and the legal exposure of a sitting president. They also pointed to Merchan's conduct, including a gag order, contempt rulings, and a small political donation to a Democratic cause, as grounds for federal review.

Trump, who has long denied having had any sexual encounter with Daniels, argued that the payments were part of a standard legal retainer and denies knowing of any unlawful scheme. The prosecution, led by Bragg, theorized in court that the reimbursements were falsified in furtherance of a separate and unspecified crime — a move by prosecutors that critics said was legally creative, if not tenuous. That maneuver allowed Bragg to elevate misdemeanor business record violations into felonies.

Trump's defense team argued that Cohen lacked credibility and that Trump, unaware of any wrongdoing, was simply signing checks tied to a legal retainer. Daniels has said the money was intended to cover up the alleged sexual encounter she said took place with Trump at a 2006 celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe.

Despite losing the trial, Trump's legal team has claimed vindication of a different sort: Bove and Blanche have been promoted to top legal posts in his administration's Justice Department. Trump's other former defense attorney, D. John Sauer, is the solicitor general fighting to uphold his executive agenda policies in federal court.

Meanwhile, Trump's legal fortunes have shifted dramatically since his conviction last May. Both of his federal indictments, one over the Jan. 6 riot and the other involving classified documents, were dropped under long-standing DOJ policy barring prosecution of a sitting president. The election racketeering case in Georgia stalled indefinitely after the state appeals court removed Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, also an elected Democrat, from the prosecution.

With those cases sidelined, the New York conviction now stands alone as the sole election-season criminal case against Trump to produce a verdict. The appeal will be heard by a three-judge panel of the 2nd Circuit: Judge Raymond J. Lohier Jr., nominated by former President Barack Obama; Judge Susan L. Carney, appointed by Obama; and Judge Myrna Perez, appointed by former President Joe Biden.

No timeline for a ruling is guaranteed. However, should Trump prevail, it could open the door for removing the cases to a federal court, where Trump could seek to have the charges dismissed entirely or demand a new trial under federal procedures. Because he is the sitting president, Trump could not face a federal trial while in office.

Attorney General Pam Bondi faced criticism from the press Wednesday morning regarding the Insurrection Act and whether the Trump administration would invoke it against protesters.

“What is the bar for invoking the Insurrection Act, and can you describe some of the conversations around that particular topic that have been underway?” a media member asked Bondi outside the White House.

She didn't answer directly, instead speaking about the importance of keeping California safe amid protest activity that has led to violence and significant property damage. 

Bondi's boss, President Donald Trump, didn't rule out using the act against protesters in Los Angeles or elsewhere if needed, saying Tuesday, “If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it.”

That led to thorny questions for Bondi over exactly what Trump meant and whether he had credibility on the topic following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot four years ago.

“Let's ask that again,” another reporter said. “What is the threshold for invoking the Insurrection Act? Beyond California. Are you seeing examples in other cities where the president might have to consider it?”

Bondi said the Department of Justice is using the Hobbs Act, which criminalizes robbery or extortion affecting interstate commerce, and said some other places, such as New York City, had done a better job handling protests than California.

“Right now in California, we're at a good point,” Bondi said. “We're not scared to go further. We're not frightened to do something else if we need to.”

Democrats have used the term “insurrection” to describe the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, and the Colorado Supreme Court ruled in 2023 that Trump was ineligible to be president due to the 14th Amendment's ban on insurrectionists holding office. The Supreme Court later overturned that ruling.

“You've been criticized for having a double standard with the president pardoning all these people who attacked police officers on Jan. 6 in his first day in office,” a reporter asked Bondi. “How do you answer that criticism?”

Bondi said the two situations were “very different.”

“These are people out there hurting people in California right now,” she said. “This is ongoing. No longer. We're going to protect them. We're going to do everything we can to prosecute violent criminals in California.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

HOLMDEL, New Jersey — Former Republican state Rep. Jack Ciattarelli won the New Jersey Republican primary for the governor's race Tuesday evening.

Ciattarelli was the clear front-runner in the race, and his popularity only increased after he received President Donald Trump's “complete and total endorsement.” The Associated Press called the race at 8:17 p.m., shortly after the polls closed. With about two-thirds of the ballots counted, Ciattarelli received 67% of the vote, over radio host Bill Spadea at 22% and state Sen. Jon Bramnick at 6%.

At Bell Works, a business hub in Holmdel, Ciattarelli celebrated his resounding win with a crowd of supporters, some donning red shirts, MAGA hats, and signs reading “Mikie made Millions,” in a dig at his November opponent. 

Ciattarelli thanked Trump for his endorsement while also making a broad appeal to welcome New Jersey voters to the Republican Party.

“Along the way, we also made a strong statement: What our New Jersey Republican program stands for,” Ciattarelli said at his campaign party. “A party open to anyone and everyone who's going to work hard to play by the rules, a party of Jersey values and common sense policies.”

This is Ciattarelli's third run for governor. He came in second in the Republican gubernatorial primary in 2017. However, by 2021, he won the GOP nomination and inched within 3 points of Gov. Phil Murphy (D-NJ) for the general election. New Jersey has been trending more favorable for Republicans, with Trump coming within 5 points of winning the historically blue state in the 2024 election. State Republicans are expressing confidence in a Ciattarelli win going into November.

At the federal level, New Jersey has not elected a Republican for president or to the Senate in decades, though at the state level, they have had better luck. Former two-term Gov. Chris Christie was the last Republican to govern the state from 2010 to 2018.

Ciattarelli will face Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ), who beat a crowded field of Democrats.

Trump, a part-time resident of the state, will likely be a focal point of the race moving forward. Democrats in the primary framed themselves as being the front line pushing back against Trump.

NEW JERSEY REPUBLICANS CONFIDENT ABOUT GUBERNATORIAL WIN AS ODDS SHIFT

Ciattarelli was a Trump critic but has embraced the president's agenda in his 2025 campaign. Should he be elected governor, Ciattarelli has promised not to enter legal battles with the Trump administration, to remove New Jersey's status as a sanctuary state, and to create a state program similar to the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency.

“We can't play games when it comes to Elections, and New Jersey is a very important State that we must WIN. The whole World is watching. Vote for Jack Ciattarelli to, MAKE NEW JERSEY GREAT AGAIN!” Trump said Saturday on Truth Social.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

As President Donald Trump crossed a dangerous line at Fort Bragg, the brass failed to speak out in the Army's defense.

President Donald Trump continued his war against America's most cherished military traditions today when he delivered a speech at Fort Bragg. It is too much to call it a “speech”; it was, instead, a ramble, full of grievance and anger, just like his many political-rally performances. He took the stage to Lee Greenwood's “God Bless the USA”—which has become a MAGA anthem—and then pointed to the “fake news,” encouraging military personnel to jeer at the press.

He mocked former President Joe Biden and attacked various other political rivals. He elicited cheers from the crowd by announcing that he would rename U.S. bases (or re-rename them) after Confederate traitors. He repeated his hallucinatory narrative about the invasion of America by foreign criminals and lunatics. He referred to 2024 as the “election of a president who loves you,” to a scatter of cheers and applause. And then he attacked the governor of California and the mayor of Los Angeles, again presiding over jeers at elected officials of the United States.

He led soldiers, in other words, in a display of unseemly behavior that ran contrary to everything the founder of the U.S. Army, George Washington, strove to imbue in the American armed forces.

The president also encouraged a violation of regulations. Trump, himself a convicted felon, doesn't care about rules and laws, but active-duty military members are not allowed to attend political rallies in uniform. They are not allowed to express partisan views while on duty, or to show disrespect for American elected officials. Trump may not know these rules and regulations, but the officers who lead these men and women know them well. It is part of their oath, their credo, and their identity as officers to remain apart from such displays. Young soldiers will make mistakes. But if senior officers remain silent, what lesson will those young men and women take from what happened today?

The president cares nothing for the military, for its history, or for the men and women who serve the United States. They are, like everything else around him, only raw material: They either feed his narcissism, or they are useless. Those who love him, he claims as “his” military. But those who have laid down their life for their country are, as he so repugnantly put it, just suckers and losers, anonymous saps lying under cold headstones in places such as Arlington National Cemetery that clearly make Trump uncomfortable. Today, he showed that he has no compunction about turning every American soldier into a hooting partisan.

Trump's supporters and his party will excuse his behavior at Fort Bragg the way they always have, the same way that indulgent parents shrug helplessly at their delinquent children. But senior officers of the United States military have an obligation to speak up and be leaders.  Where is the Army chief of staff, General Randy George? Will he speak truth to the commander in chief and put a stop to the assault on the integrity of his troops? Where is the commander of the airborne troops, Lieutenant General Gregory Anderson, or even Colonel Chad Mixon, the base commander?

And if these men cannot muster the courage to defend American traditions—by speaking out or even resigning—where are the other senior officers who must uphold the values that have made America's armed forces among the most effective and politically stable militaries in the world? Where is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Dan Caine? He was personally selected by Trump to be America's most senior military officer. Will he tell the man who promoted him that what he did today was obscene?

Will any of these men say one word? Will any of them defend the Army and the other services from a would-be caudillo, a man who would probably be strutting around in a giant hat and a golden shoulder braid if he could get away with it? The top officers of the U.S. military wear eagles or stars on their shoulders that give them great privilege, as befits people who assume responsibility for the defense of the nation and the welfare of their troops. They command the power of life and death itself on the field of battle. But those ranks also carry immense responsibility. If they are truly Washington's heirs, they should speak up—now—and stand with the first commander in chief against the rogue 47th.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The White House Is Delighted With Events in Los Angeles","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/06/trump-national-guard-los-angeles-hegseth/683104/","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 01:53:00 GMT","

But Trump aides know there are real risks for the president if troops are involved in violence.

The last time President Donald Trump tried to send military forces into American streets to put down civil unrest, in June 2020, Pete Hegseth was positioned outside the White House with a Kevlar helmet and riot shield.



Major Hegseth's mobilization as part of a District of Columbia National Guard unit summoned to restore order in the nation's capital, where protests had erupted following the police murder of George Floyd, occurred as Pentagon leaders scrambled to avert what they feared could be a confrontation between active-duty U.S. forces and their fellow Americans.



Today, Hegseth is second only to the president in directing the administration's use of the National Guard and active-duty Marines to respond to unrest over immigration raids in Los Angeles. And this time, the military's civilian leadership isn't acting as a brake on Trump's impulse to escalate the confrontation. The Hegseth-led Pentagon is an accelerant.



The administration's decision to federalize 4,000 California National Guard forces, contrary to Governor Gavin Newsom's wishes, and to dispatch 700 active-duty Marines to the Los Angeles area, marks a break with decades of tradition under which presidents have limited their use of the military on American soil. If there are any internal misgivings about busting through yet another democratic norm, they haven't surfaced publicly. Indeed, officials at the White House told us they are satisfied with the way the L.A. confrontation has unfolded. They believe that it highlights their focus on immigration and law and order, and places Democrats on the wrong side of both. One widely circulated photo—showing a masked protester standing in front of a burning car, waving a Mexican flag—has been embraced by Trump supporters as a distillation of the conflict: a president unafraid to use force to defend an American city from those he deems foreign invaders.



“We couldn't have scripted this better,” said a senior White House aide granted anonymity to discuss internal conversations. “It's like the 2024 election never ended: Trump is strong while Democrats are weak and defending the indefensible.”



Democrats, of course, take a different view, and say the administration's actions have only risked triggering further violence. Retired officers who study how the armed forces have been used in democracies told us they share those concerns. They point to the damage that Trump's orders could do to the military's relationship with the citizens it serves.



“We should be very careful, cautious, and even reluctant to use the military inside our country,” Bradley Bowman, a former Army officer who heads the defense program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told us.



Conor Friedersdorf: Averting a worst-case scenario in Los Angeles



State and local authorities typically use law-enforcement personnel as a first response to civil disturbances or riots, followed by National Guard forces if needed. Retired Major General Randy Manner, who served as acting vice chief of the National Guard Bureau during the Obama administration, said the federalizing of California Guard forces—putting them under presidential rather than state control, a move allowed with certain limits—pulls those service members away from their civilian jobs and makes it harder to complete planned training or exercises. “Basically, the risk does not justify the investment of these forces, and it will negatively impact on readiness,” Manner told us.



Retired officers we spoke with also drew a distinction between the involvement of National Guard and active-duty forces. Whereas National Guard troops assist citizens after natural disasters and have the advantage of knowing the communities they serve, active-duty forces are primarily trained to “see the enemy and neutralize the enemy,” said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine colonel now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “When you're dealing with U.S. citizens, no matter what they're doing, that's not the right mindset.”



“This is not Fallujah,” Bowman added. “This is Los Angeles.”



Juliette Kayyem: Trump's gross misuse of the National Guard



This morning, Hegseth made his first congressional appearance since his bruising confirmation process, appearing before a House committee. His tone with Democrats was at times combative. When Representative Betty McCollum, a Minnesota Democrat, asked the defense secretary what the cost of the California deployment would be, he declined to provide a figure and instead pivoted to criticism of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz for the state's response to the violence that followed Floyd's killing in 2020. (Military officials said later they expected the Los Angeles deployment, as envisioned, to cost roughly $134 million.)



“If you've got millions of illegals, you don't know where they're coming from, they're waving flags from foreign countries and assaulting police officers, that's a problem,” Hegseth told lawmakers.



Trump, for his part, told reporters that anyone who tries to protest at the Saturday parade celebrating the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army will “be met with very big force.” He also said that he wouldn't hesitate to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would permit him to employ the military for law enforcement or to suppress a rebellion, if he believed that circumstances required. Speaking to troops at Fort Bragg in North Carolina later in the day, the president promised to stop the “anarchy” in California. “We will liberate Los Angeles and make it free, clean, and safe again,” he said. “We will not allow an American city to be invaded and conquered by a foreign enemy.”



Some Republicans have privately expressed worry that Trump may overplay a winning hand. Even in the West Wing, two people we spoke with tried to downplay the incendiary rhetoric from Trump and Hegseth. They stressed that, to this point, National Guard forces have been in a defensive posture, protecting federal buildings. Although they believe that Trump has the political advantage at the moment, they acknowledged there would be real risks if U.S. troops got involved in violence. “We don't know who would get blamed but no one wins if that happens,” one senior aide told us. “No one wants to see that.”



Hegseth's support for using active-duty troops in Los Angeles stands in contrast to what his predecessor did in 2020. At that time, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, along with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley, scrambled to block Trump's desire to employ active-duty forces against the demonstrators protesting racial violence. The president had mused about shooting protesters in the legs, Esper wrote later. To satisfy his boss while also avoiding a dangerous confrontation, the defense chief called active-duty forces from Fort Bragg to Northern Virginia but sought to keep them out of the fray.



Tom Nichols: Trump is using the National Guard as bait



In his 2024 book, The War on Warriors, Hegseth described how his experience as a D.C. Guardsman in 2020 crystallized his views about the divide between military personnel and what he saw as the degenerate protesters who were lobbing bricks and bottles of urine at the citizen soldiers. When the D.C. Guard was again summoned seven months later, to help secure the 2021 inauguration following the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, Hegseth was told to stand down because fellow Guardsmen suspected that one of his tattoos was a sign of extremism. (Hegseth has maintained it is part of his Christian faith.)



Hegseth was angered by his exclusion and resigned from the Guard. That experience remains with him as he attempts to reshape the military, and its role in society, in line with Trump's worldview. As he has written: “My trust for this Army is irrevocably broken.”

Trump has signaled an end date for FEMA.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

FEMA now has an end date. President Donald Trump said yesterday that he intends to phase out the Federal Emergency Management Administration after this hurricane season, canceling it like an HBO series. States should lead their own disaster response, he said, suggesting he does not understand that states already do lead disaster response; they just can't do it without an infusion of FEMA dollars and expertise when the disaster is too big. “The governor should be able to handle it,” Trump said. The buck has been passed.



The Atlantic hurricane season lasts from now until November. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is predicting an above-normal number of named storms this year. The weather doesn't stop after that, of course. Fire season overlaps with hurricane season, another time of intense FEMA activity, and in recent years, fires have broken the bounds of any usual seasons; the devastating Los Angeles fires were in January. Even if this year's disasters do quiet after November, hurricane season starts again next June. The administration will convene a council to eliminate FEMA “as it exists today,” Kristi Noem, the secretary of Homeland Security, said yesterday—but those few short months in between seasons are hardly enough time to dismantle the federal apparatus of disaster response and transfer full responsibility to the states without casualties. Literal casualties, potentially. (FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.)



But, fine, we get FEMA for this hurricane season. Already, it will be a test of what happens when FEMA is hobbled and anemic. Under the Trump administration, the agency has lost roughly a quarter of its core staff. One acting chief of FEMA was pushed out after saying that the agency should not be abolished; his replacement told staffers he wasn't aware that the United States had a hurricane season. (The administration later said this was a joke.) Should any single storm—or, worse, multiple storms—turn into a major disaster this year, the responsibility that state governments might be expected to shoulder in a FEMA-less America could come as a shock to them, and to their constituents.



Many close watchers of FEMA do think the agency needs a dramatic shake-up and that states should be responsible for more of the financial burden of catastrophe. FEMA was originally intended to handle a relatively small number of catastrophic disasters a year, but now deals with many dozens annually, both because the rate of disasters is increasing and because the agency is being drafted into handling more of them. The ballooning costs of response and recovery regularly exceed FEMA's main disaster budget, requiring emergency and ad hoc funding to bridge the gap.



Meanwhile, states have come to rely on federal funds to bail them out and, in the quiet moments between storms and fires, are free to make imprudent development decisions: Might as well let developers build those waterfront homes if FEMA will pick up the tab when they flood. “Our system creates some really perverse incentives that need to be addressed,” Andrew Rumbach, a senior fellow at the nonprofit Urban Institute, told me. More risk should be transferred to the states, he and others said.



But that would take time to do safely, and require a major infusion of cash to the states to bolster any FEMA-replacing infrastructure, according to the experts I spoke with. Ending FEMA, as Trump says he will, could easily result in a highly uneven landscape of disaster safety.  The logic for FEMA was all about efficiency: For many states, disasters are rare, and having 50 sets of personnel and resources on standby for those rare events is far more costly than having a centralized stockpile that can be deployed around the country as needed. Good disaster response also requires time spent in disaster mode. States with infrequent disasters naturally lack that. FEMA's strength is that it deals with crises all the time.



That experience is part of what the agency is now losing. Many senior personnel, including those who coordinate responses during emergencies, have left since January, according to The New York Times. Those decades of experience aren't easy to replace, Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, an associate professor at Columbia University who has worked in disaster planning, told me. “Emergency management isn't something where you take a few courses and all of a sudden you can run a complex emergency.” And in states that don't regularly handle floods or hurricanes, staff, “won't have the muscle memory” of how to respond when a storm suddenly intensifies, North Carolina Governor Josh Stein said in a press conference last week. He said his state experienced this firsthand when Hurricane Helene hit western North Carolina last year: That part of the state had “a lot of new people in emergency-management positions,” he said. “We need the expertise that exists in FEMA.”



Wealthier states, such as California, and states that, like Florida, have extensive experience in response coordination may not be as hurt by changes at the federal level. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has said his state doesn't need FEMA; just give Florida a chunk of money instead. (Trump's intention to end FEMA does not yet clearly include major transfers of funds to states to run their own response and recovery programs; he said yesterday that future funds may come directly from the “president's office,” rather than FEMA.) Rumbach says he heard that same desire from officials in Kentucky, when he taught an emergency-management training workshop there. “Their main argument was ‘We don't need FEMA. Just give us the money; we know what to do with it.'”



Poorer states and states that scarcely see disasters will inevitably be most vulnerable to FEMA's total absence. Arizona, for example, has received among the fewest FEMA funds in recent years, in part because it isn't in the path of hurricanes and recent wildfires have not burned as ferociously there as in other western states. But that means the state is ill-prepared for a low-probability but high-devastation event, as The Arizona Republic recently noted. If and when Arizona's luck runs out, it may not have the infrastructure or the funds to manage the crisis alone.



“You're going to see a lot of states not prepared. And a lot of people in harm's way may not be fully capable of recovering if there is an event,” Carlos Martín, a vice president at Resources for the Future, an environmental think tank, told me. Plus, an every-state-for-themselves approach comes with the obvious challenges of a free market: At present, FEMA stockpiles essential goods to distribute after emergencies. If that stockpile isn't maintained, wealthier states could handily outcompete poorer states for supplies during multistate emergencies, according to the Atlantic Council, which found that red states are likely to be on the losing side most.



This all means that more citizens may fall through the disaster-assistance cracks. FEMA has said, for instance, that it will stop its door-to-door outreach this season and rely instead on “more targeted venues”; when a federal disaster is declared, FEMA often goes around the area and knocks on every person's door to let them know what programs they could apply to for assistance. Now, Rumbach worries, people living in the most rural places, as well as people who may not be mobile—the elderly and those with certain disabilities—may never know about those programs. “A lot of the stories about how badly things went are going to come out later,” he said.



Even in a state with personnel on the ground to capture the full scope of need, a lot of disaster response after that step is paperwork, Schlegelmilch said. Right now, an entire private-sector ecosystem of organizations helps states apply for FEMA funds, and helps FEMA direct its resources. Even if states are on their own, they will still need a system to do something similar. Remaking grant-application processes and managing the bureaucracy of distributing funds will be yet another growing pain of the transition. “That's going to shock all of the states,” Schlegelmilch said.



If Trump were to decide that reforming FEMA were a more prudent choice than scrapping it, ideas abound. As FEMA's administrator during Barack Obama's presidency, Craig Fugate promoted the idea of a “disaster deductible” for states modeled off insurance deductibles; state officials might then be held more accountable for preparing for disasters (which right now tends to mean little to voters) rather than rewarded politically for acquiring disaster funding after the fact. The previous Trump administration created a fund (which Joe Biden expanded) meant to help states prevent the worst impact of disasters before they happen. That program moved billions in funds under local control, with the aim of fixing long-standing infrastructure problems that would have made future disasters more dangerous and expensive. But Trump already canceled it this term. “It's hard to see how they're not increasing risk,” Rumbach said. “We're going to pay for it one way or another.”



For all these reasons, Rumbach is betting that “reality will set in,” and that the federal government will not radically shrink its share of disaster spending so quickly. But the loss of key personnel and the looming dissolution mean that major damage to national readiness has already been done. And the hasty budget changes mean some people will get hurt. The country's emergency-management system “doesn't have to be completely broken to have really bad impacts,” he said. If the national ability to respond to disasters falters at all, then “recovery is slower, more chaotic, less efficient,” Rumbach said. “When that happens, people are suffering for longer, they're more traumatized, communities don't recover as quickly.”



The United States has already seen what happens when a major weather catastrophe arrives shortly after a president hastily rearranges FEMA. After the newly formed Department of Homeland Security took over the agency in 2003, George W. Bush's administration eliminated emergency managers and resources, particularly in regional offices. When Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, the depleted agency badly botched the response. “We've read this story before,” Schlegelmilch said. There's little reason to think it'll end differently this time around.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

His military deployment in Los Angeles follows a long, disturbing tradition.

Revolutions have a logic. The revolutionaries start with a big, transformative, impossible goal. They want to remake society, smash existing institutions, replace them with something different. They know they will do damage on the road to their utopia, and they know people will object. Committed to their ideology, the revolutionaries pursue their goals anyway.

Inevitably, a crisis appears. Perhaps many people, even most people, don't want regime change, or don't share the revolutionaries' utopian vision. Perhaps there are unplanned disasters. Smashing institutions can have unexpected, sometimes catastrophic, consequences, as the history of post-revolutionary famines shows very well.

But whatever the nature of the crisis, it forces the revolutionaries to make a choice. Give up—or radicalize. Find compromises—or polarize society further. Slow down—or use violence.

The bloodiest, most damaging revolutions have all been shaped by people making the most extreme choices. When the Bolsheviks ran into opposition in 1918, they unleashed the Red Terror. When the Chinese Communists encountered resistance, Mao sent teenage Red Guards to torment professors and civil servants. Sometimes the violence was mere theater, lecture halls full of people demanding that victims recant. Sometimes it was real. But it always served a purpose: to provoke, to divide, and then to allow the revolutionaries to suspend the law, create an emergency, and rule by decree.

I doubt very much that Donald Trump knows a lot about the methods of Bolsheviks or Maoists, although I am certain that some of his entourage does. But he is now leading an assault on what some around him call the administrative state, which the rest of us call the U.S. government. This assault is revolutionary in nature. Trump's henchmen have a set of radical, sometimes competing goals, all of which require fundamental changes in the nature of the American state. The concentration of power in the hands of the president. The replacement of the federal civil service with loyalists. The transfer of resources from the poor to the rich, especially rich insiders with connections to Trump. The removal, to the extent possible, of brown-skinned people from America, and the return to an older American racial hierarchy.

Juliette Kayyem: Trump's gross misuse of the National Guard

Trump and his allies also have revolutionary methods. Elon Musk sent DOGE engineers, some the same age as Mao's Red Guards, into one government department after the next to capture computers, take data, and fire staff. Trump has launched targeted attacks on institutions that symbolize the power and prestige of the old regime: Harvard, the television networks, the National Institutes of Health. ICE has sent agents in military gear to conduct mass arrests of people who may or may not be undocumented immigrants, but whose arrests will frighten and silence whole communities. Trump's family and friends have rapidly destroyed a matrix of ethical checks and balances in order to enrich the president and themselves.

But their revolutionary project is now running into reality. More than 200 times, courts have questioned the legality of Trump's decisions, including the arbitrary tariffs and the deportations of people without due process. Judges have ordered the administration to rehire people who were illegally fired. DOGE is slowly being revealed as a failure, maybe even a hoax: Not only has it not saved much money, but the damage done by Musk's engineers might prove even more expensive to fix, once the costs of lawsuits, broken contracts, and the loss of government capacity are calculated. The president's signature legislation, his budget bill, has met resistance from senior Republicans and Wall Street CEOs who fear that it will destroy the U.S. government's credibility, and even resistance from Musk himself.

Now Trump faces the same choice as his revolutionary predecessors: Give up—or radicalize. Find compromises—or polarize society further. Slow down—or use violence. Like his revolutionary predecessors, Trump has chosen radicalization and polarization, and he is openly seeking to provoke violence.

For the moment, the administration's demonstration of force is mostly performative, a made-for-TV show designed to pit the United States military against protesters in a big Democratic city. The choice of venue for sweeping, indiscriminate raids—Home Depot stores around Los Angeles, and not, say, a golf club in Florida—seems orchestrated to appeal to Trump voters. The deployment of the U.S. military is designed to create frightening images, not to fulfill an actual need. The governor of California did not ask for U.S. troops; the mayor of Los Angeles did not ask for U.S. troops; even the L.A. police made clear that there was no emergency, and that they did not require U.S. troops.

David Frum: For Trump, this is a dress rehearsal

But this is not the final stage of the revolution. The Marines in Los Angeles may provoke more violence, and that may indeed be the true purpose of their mission; after all, the Marines are primarily trained not to do civilian crowd control, but to kill the enemies of the United States. In an ominous speech at Fort Bragg yesterday, Trump reverted to the dehumanizing rhetoric he used during the election campaign, calling protesters “animals” and “a foreign enemy,” language that seems to give permission to the Marines to kill people. Even if this confrontation ends without violence, the presence of the military in Los Angeles breaks another set of norms and prepares the way for another escalation, another set of emergency decrees, another opportunity to discard the rule of law later on.

The logic of revolution often traps revolutionaries: They start out thinking that the task will be swift and easy. The people will support them. Their cause is just. But as their project falters, their vision narrows. At each obstacle, after each catastrophe, the turn to violence becomes that much swifter, the harsh decisions that much easier. If not stopped, by Congress or the courts, the Trump revolution will follow that logic too.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The Simpsons has always been a wholesome show—even if some critics didn't necessarily understand that.

In 1992, The Simpsons was one of the most beloved sitcoms on television. Critics adored it; the ratings were climbing higher and higher; the show had entered what fans would eventually come to regard as its funniest period, roughly Seasons 3 through 8.

But the animated series still scared some adults. There had never been a boy on network TV as openly irreverent as Bart Simpson, who said “hell” and “damn” and talked back to his teacher. Mere months after the show debuted, in December 1989, schools across the United States started banning a T-shirt declaring, “Bart Simpson ‘Underachiever': And Proud of It, Man!” James Dobson, the founder of the evangelical organization Focus on the Family, weighed in on that particular piece of merch, writing that it made the “pervasive problem of underachievement” even worse.

As quaint as Bart's antics might seem now, he and The Simpsons as a whole represented youth in revolt. The moral panic was misplaced, but not unusual—part of a long national tradition of culture wars waged under the pretense of politics.

But what critics of the prime-time cartoon either fundamentally misunderstood (or conveniently overlooked) was its core truths. Bart loved his parents. He went to church with them. The Simpsons sometimes struggled to make ends meet, and they didn't always get along, but they stuck together. They were a typical middle-American family—and, despite Bart's rude language, not the symbol of societal rot that culture-war targets are often imagined to be.  There are numerous early-season examples of the family's underlying integrity. Marge's bowling instructor, Jacques, woos her, but she resists and dramatically reconciles with Homer, whom she'd been arguing with. Homer decides to steal cable, but eventually stops when Lisa, the show's voice of reason, convinces him it's wrong. Lisa exposes a corrupt congressman at the expense of personal glory. Homer gives up religion only to realize that his faith is important to him. Sure, there's a scene in the series premiere in which Bart gets a real tattoo—but the story ends sweetly, with the family adopting a greyhound track reject named Santa's Little Helper.  “Look, this show's good,” the Simpsons writer Jeff Martin once told me. “It's essentially moral. It's for everybody.”

In its early days, The Simpsons was everywhere: on TV, on merch, on magazine covers (back when that still moved the needle), in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The show's ubiquity is likely what put it on the radar of George H. W. Bush's administration. In May 1990, a news story mentioned that the White House's drug czar, William Bennett, had noticed a Bart Simpson poster at a rehabilitation center. “That's not going to help you any,” Bennett reportedly said to the residents. (He later claimed that he was kidding.) In a People interview later that year, first lady Barbara Bush called The Simpsons “the dumbest thing I've ever seen.”

In the first case, the show's producers responded with a snarky statement: “If our drug czar thinks he can sit down and talk with a cartoon character, he must be on something.” In the second, they decided to take a kill-'em-with-kindness approach, sending the first lady a letter written in the voice of Marge, who politely defended her family. “Ma'am, if we're the dumbest thing you ever saw,” Marge wrote, “Washington must be a good deal different than what they teach me at the current events group at the church.” Barbara Bush sent an apologetic reply: “Clearly,” she wrote, “you are setting a good example for the rest of the country.”

At that point, the Bush-Bart beef was dead. Then, early in his reelection campaign, the president brought it back to life. On January 27, 1992, he spoke at the National Religious Broadcasters convention. His speech wasn't terribly memorable, except for one section. “The next value I speak of must be forever cast in stone,” Bush said. “I speak of decency, the moral courage to say what is right and condemn what is wrong. And we need a nation closer to The Waltons than The Simpsons—an America that rejects the incivility, the tide of incivility, and the tide of intolerance.”

The Waltons was a Great Depression–set drama about a good-natured blue-collar Virginia family that aired on CBS for most of the 1970s. The smash-hit show was a temporary antidote to the tumult of the time, and Bush's speechwriter Curt Smith was a big fan. He thought that The Waltons embodied a kind of propriety that appealed to Middle America. To him, The Simpsons did not. When I interviewed him in 2022, Smith told me he felt that the sarcastic animated series looked down on the heartland. “You had two cultures at war in this country. And I say that sadly,” he said. “The Waltons with red America and The Simpsons with blue America.”

To play up that divide, Smith added the Waltons/Simpsons comparison into Bush's address. According to Smith, his boss approved. As soon as the president said the line, it became a sound bite, which satisfied Smith. “I felt deeply that the line was germane,” he told me. “I thought it was true. And it would help us politically.”

He turned out to be wrong about that last part. Bush's broadside pushed the creators of The Simpsons to fire back by tacking on a scene to the opening of that week's episode, a rerun. The family is gathered around the TV, which is playing footage of the president's insult. As soon as it's over, Bart perks up and says, “Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression, too.” The mainstream media also pointed out the irony of the president waxing poetic about an old TV show that took place during a terrible economy. “Yes, ma and pa,” the syndicated columnist Ellen Goodman wrote on January 31, 1992, “George-boy is leading us back through the haze of nostalgia to those wonderful yesteryears of the 1930s.”

It was an example of how out of touch the sexagenarian incumbent was in the eyes of many voters—at least compared with his opponent, a saxophone-playing Baby Boomer. As Bush's campaign progressed, he doubled down, bringing back the Waltons/Simpsons line for his arrival speech at the Republican National Convention. In the end, Bill Clinton won fairly easily in '92—with the help of the independent Ross Perot, who yanked some votes away from Bush—taking chunks of Middle America with him.

It would be a stretch to say that Bush's decision to poke at The Simpsons cost him a second term. But it did demonstrate how silly politicians can look when they try to use pop culture to score easy points with their base. People in the heartland watched the show, too—partly because the Simpsons had the same issues as millions of Americans. The second-season premiere of the show, for example, focuses on Bart's academic troubles. The anxiety he and his parents have over whether he might have to repeat the fourth grade feels real. “‘Bart Gets an F' is not only funny, it's touching,” the Washington Post critic Tom Shales wrote in his review. “You really find yourself rooting for this bratty little drawing.”

When it came to family life, The Simpsons certainly felt realistic. There are episodes centering on Lisa's feeling unseen and unappreciated by her parents and turning to a substitute teacher for guidance, the stress caused by the cost of Homer's looming triple-bypass surgery, Marge's breaking down when the pressure of motherhood becomes too much to bear. But every week, they all manage to work through their problems and regroup. That basic blueprint helped The Simpsons become an institution. The show was at its core wholesome, even if the president at the time didn't acknowledge as much.

Read: The last WASP president

It wasn't the first time, and wouldn't be the last time, a politician who claimed that a pop-culture icon was threatening American values left out key information about his target. Just last month, after Bruce Springsteen criticized him onstage in England, President Donald Trump responded by going after the musician on social media. “I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about President of the United States,” he posted on Truth Social. “Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he's not a talented guy.”

Springsteen has never made his music just for the “radical” or the “left”; he's piled up millions of fans by speaking directly about the everyday anxieties of small-town life. His music has reflected America, in other words. And even in the face of threats made by the president, the rock star hasn't backed down. He included his remarks against Trump as an intro on his new live EP, Land of Hope & Dreams—the kind of burn that The Simpsons might have come up with. Back then, it wasn't just defiance that made the counterattack so effective—the show understood itself better than the president did.

﻿For Trump's ideological allies, it's always 2020.

When President Donald Trump and Elon Musk had their dramatic falling-out last week, it appeared the right was on the brink of civil war — with Musk's allies in the “tech right” poised to battle Steve Bannon and his faction of populist tribunes. The battle lines reflected deep disagreements between the right's factions about the nature and purpose of government, divides made increasingly salient by Trump's policies in areas like trade.

But now, after several days of protests and unrest in Los Angeles, everyone is once again reading from the same hymnal — condemning disorder and calling for a harsh crackdown. Even Musk is back to retweeting Trump like nothing happened.

Why this intra-right ceasefire? Because what's happening in LA reminds every component of the modern right why they're in coalition together: They believe that progressives in general, and the “woke” left activists in particular, represent an existential threat to everything good about the United States.

This vision has deep philosophical roots on the right, which has always positioned itself around defending elements of the status quo from its enemies on the left. But the 2025 American right tells itself a very particular version of that general story, one that focuses on the events of summer 2020.

The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.

In their minds, the combination of Covid restrictions, mainstream calls for wide-ranging social change, and mass street upheaval was the terrible terminus of modern progressive politics. Whatever their internal disagreements on issues like trade or spending or even immigration, the modern right agrees that the left must never be permitted another year like 2020 — and that Trump is the best vehicle for stopping it.

The Trump coalition has appeared fractious for much of 2025 because the big policy moves, like tariffs, have made areas of disagreement in the coalition more salient. It appears united for now because the news cycle has shifted to a topic — the specter of radical left street disorder — on which nearly everyone inside of it agrees.

Philosophically speaking, the right has long been defined by its emphasis on the value of stability — as odd as it may seem in the era of Trump's radically destabilizing administration.

Conservative theorists, most notably Edmund Burke, have long maintained that political flourishing depends on the existence of stable social rules developed gradually and from the bottom up over the course of generations. Those who seek to overturn this order, either through sweeping legislation or revolutionary violence, will inevitably do more harm than good. For this reason, the right's intellectuals have long positioned themselves against what they saw as instances of leftist street violence.

Yet Trump has spent the past 10 years setting the American political order on fire — demolishing its norms, enacting radical changes to its longstanding policies, and flagrantly violating its laws. He even incited an honest-to-God insurrection aimed at overturning an election. How could any of this fit with a tradition premised on the values of stability and order?

The answer, in part, is that it doesn't. The intellectual right has adopted a self-consciously revolutionary mode of politics, seeing the current political order as a fundamentally corrupt system that deserves to be torn down. This is a reactionary rejection of Burkean conservatism, which is why so many erstwhile Burkeans became the Never Trumpers who publish at places like The Dispatch and The Bulwark. 

And yet, there's a crucial element of the Burkean emphasis on order that the Trump right has retained: a belief that some specific elements of American life remain uncorrupted, and that the “woke left” must be defeated for those elements to again become the country's defining traits. Traditional religion, conservative cultural values, a market economy, the notion of national pride, and even nationhood itself — these are the elements of the United States that the modern right sees as being under attack from the left and the institutions (like universities) where it is in control.

This sense of siege, of a need for counterrevolution, crystalized in the summer of 2020.

It wasn't only that there was rioting in America's cities, or that major American cultural institutions were aligning themselves with once-radical views on race and gender. It's that both were happening at the same time, suggesting that radicals in the streets were seizing the commanding heights of American public life.

“The individual acts of violence — the sacking of urban police stations, the Molotov cocktails thrown at police cruisers, the toppling of historical statues, the wholesale looting of big-box stores — were, in fact, the representations of a long-running cultural revolution,” leading right-wing activist Chris Rufo wrote in his 2023 book America's Cultural Revolution. “In city after city, [Black Lives Matter] activists, including its paramilitaries in the black nationalist and anarcho-socialist factions, shut down urban neighborhoods, intimidated residents, and established their ideology as a social requisite.”

This is, to my mind, a wildly exaggerated narrative of that summer's events (a consistent problem in Rufo's work). It vastly overstates the pervasiveness of the violence and paints with an ideologically overbroad brush, ignoring that most people were in the streets because they were deeply and sincerely concerned about racism in policing.

Yet there's some truth as well. The summer's events, including riots in Minneapolis and Seattle's disastrous “autonomous zone”, did real harm to real people — in ways that many mainstream liberals and leftists were unwilling to admit at the time.

That liberal elites endorsed street protest amid the Covid pandemic, when the public health establishment was recommending people stay away from mass gatherings, fueled the right's outrage. It was, to them, a sign that the so-called establishment was not only flawed but fully corrupt; so shot through with political bias that it would tell people to go protest for George Floyd, but stop attending church.

From this was born the mythic underpinnings of the modern Trump right: a deep fear of chaotic, violent left-wing radicals, paired with a sense that mainstream liberals and nonpartisan experts are in thrall to said extremists. This is the narrative that knits together the various factions of MAGA 2.0: the tech right, the national populists, the atheist anti-wokes, the Christian nationalists, and on down the line. There are reasonable grounds to doubt that everyone believes it sincerely, but it defines much of the conceptual vocabulary right-wingers use to communicate across factional lines. We may not agree on everything, they say, but we are all against that.

What's happening in LA right now brings this set of uniting concerns to the fore.

Once again, progressives and radicals have taken to the streets to demonstrate against what they see as social injustices. Once again, there are clear instances of looting and violence (though I'd add that these are once again being widely exaggerated). And once again, it appears to many on the right as if the liberal establishment were siding with the people in the streets — with LA Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (correctly) downplaying the scale of the violence and rejecting Trump's efforts to send in the troops, in large part because they believe it to be at once unnecessary and counterproductive.

It is thus no surprise that in the face of recent events, the right's infighting would give way to a display of unity. When the right sees the specter of 2020 looming over America, its cadres feel an urgent need to form ranks.

Now that's what I call economic downturn!

These days, it seems like anything could be a recession indicator. Press-on nails. Strip club habits. Lena Dunham's exodus from New York. 

But how do we really know if there's an impending economic contraction? “There's a super wide variety of what qualifies as a so-called ‘recession indicator' on the internet,” Wall Street Journal markets reporter Hannah Erin Lang told me in the latest episode of Explain It to Me, Vox's weekly call-in podcast. “Economists and investors are often looking at these offbeat sources of data or offbeat trends. Former Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan famously looked at sales of men's underwear with the idea being that if you have to cut back, this might be a place where nobody else is going to know but yourself.”

There's another alleged recession indicator taking the internet by storm: music. People are now referring to the late-aughts and early 2010s dance hits as “recession pop.” But is there any credence to this supposed harbinger of economic downturn? That's the question posed to Switched on Pop cohost Charlie Harding on this week's episode of Explain It to Me. 

Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

Does music change with the economic outlook? 

We're all looking for a crystal ball, and music feels like it's got to be it because that's where we go to get into our feelings. So are our playlists indicating larger economic trends? I don't think so. 

That's interesting because lately there's been all this talk of recession pop. What is recession pop referring to? 

Recession pop is a made-up, after-the-fact genre, referring to upbeat, bubblegum pop music from the time of the Great Recession. We're talking about Black Eyed Peas, Lady Gaga, Kesha. 

I think that Katy Perry's whole oeuvre represents that era better than any other. We're talking about songs like “Teenage Dream,” a song which has this ongoing chord progression that never resolves, that makes you have the feeling of the teenage life that will just never end, you're never going to grow up, and it has this wonderful nostalgic quality to it. Or “Last Friday Night”: the party that is the rager that you're gonna go all-out in. Those songs had a light, effervescent, post-disco, very poppy programmed music kind of vibe. 

I want to go back in time to the time of bolero jackets and statement belts... 

You do? 

Well, okay, not literally. But we're going to go on this journey. What was the sound of that time? 

It has to sound a little over-polished, really well-made, programmed music. Meaning drum machines, synthesizers, guitars in the line of like Nile Rodgers from Chic — but not nearly as well done — sort of funk-style, disco-style guitars. You might have some really cheesy programmed strings in the background. Then the lyrics have to be either “Party, party all night forever!” or larger platitudes about being a girlboss.

What else was going on in music during that time? Other than these fun, poppy, “we're going to party all night long” songs.

Music had been going through a recession for half a decade at that point. Ever since the turn of the millennium and Napster, the illegal downloading market basically had eviscerated the music industry. It saw its revenues cut in half. Business was in freefall, to the degree that they thought that their future was in downloadable ringtones. 

Indie music was really big as the mainstream labels were struggling to figure out how to make sales. Hip-hop was going through a bling and party era. There was a lot of upbeat music during these uncertain times, that's certainly true, [but] I think it's important to note as well that during the Great Recession there was plenty of music which didn't reflect an upbeat attitude. 

One of the biggest songs of 2007 was “What Goes Around Comes Around” by Justin Timberlake. [There's also] “Umbrella” by Rihanna. I don't think of those as upbeat, happy songs. If you have to protect yourself from the rain under an umbrella, this is more acknowledging our deep upset at the national condition. 

I think that even in the recession pop era, there's music of all kinds: upbeat, downbeat, sad, happy. And so I actually think that the genre is a very slippery one that represents a lot of different kinds of music. 

Are we hearing that sound pop up now? 

Some people have said that Chappell Roan and Charli XCX are digging into the recession era in their new music. I'm a little more skeptical. If recession pop were doing really well right now, Katy Perry's “Woman's World” would have been a huge hit, and it has been a real stinker for her. 

Why are we talking about recession pop right now?

Everyone's looking for vibes of what's going on in the larger economy, but I think more largely, millennials are aging out of being cool. 

Oh, no. 

You stop listening to new music usually between 25 and 30 years old. And then when you get into a position of power where you become a curator of culture, now it's your time to assert: The thing that was good when I was young is still good. 

So this could be less about the economy and more about like those of us born in the '80s and early '90s kind of having a midlife crisis.  

Absolutely, I think there was a huge cultural midlife crisis and a claiming of power. 

I've seen tons of bars and clubs during these recession pop dance parties and I'm hearing like all these samples in music from current artists from that era. How do you explain all this? 

Recession pop is very much a real thing and it's completely made-up. There was no such thing as recession pop during the recession. It's a term that was made up only very recently. 

It is absolutely a nostalgia-driven way of getting those millennials who've got more disposable income than at any other point in their life back going out to clubs again. I also think that people are trying to remember their youth. That was a very powerful time for millennials. I think the lightheartedness of that term doesn't properly reflect the trauma that many people were going through. People were losing their jobs, their homes, their families were being ripped apart. And so I think the way that recession pop is being invoked is not trying to dig into the darkest moments of the recession, but rather remembering what it's like to be 19 years old.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:vox.com","The right refuses to take AI seriously","https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/416339/ai-openai-automation-big-beautiful-reconciliation-trump","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

Republicans are gutting the safety net as job-killing mass automation looms.

I'm writing this on a plane back to Washington, DC, from a conference in the Bay Area, the land of tomorrow. While the conference wasn't about AI, this is the Bay Area, and thus roughly 90 percent of conversations were about AI.

It is hard to overstate the scale of the gap between the cultures of the Bay Area and DC on this topic. AI has certainly become a real part of the policy conversation in DC, but only in quite technical, near-term, and not especially high-profile ways: How should we regulate deep fakes? How should we handle data centers' increasing demands for energy? Should we require Nvidia processors to have a little component that can tell if the chip is physically in China to prevent Beijing from getting its hands on too many?

But if DC's AI concerns are quotidian, the Bay Area's are existential. 

In Berkeley, or at least among the crowd I was talking to, the questions were more like: Are we ever going to be able to stop these machines from cheating on our attempts to evaluate us, from blackmailing us when we obstruct their goal, from actively working to avoid being shut down? (These are all real things that researchers have found leading-edge AI models can do.) If we don't fix these problems, will we survive the next 10 years?

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

When somewhat less apocalyptic questions like, “how will we cope if billions of people are suddenly unemployed due to AI and robotics progress,” the tone of most responses I got was something like, “God, I really hope that turns out to be the biggest problem. It means we all survived.”

Temperamentally, I'm more inclined to think about these things in very concrete, near-term ways. There's a reason I live in Washington, DC; it is a town for good-natured incrementalists. So, naturally, all the AI talk got me thinking about the huge budget reconciliation bill passed by the House and being considered by the Senate.

Let me be blunt: This is, in ways big and small, not a budget that takes AI seriously at all. Even worse, if you think this technology is going to have an even slightly significant influence on the world in the next decade, the One Big Beautiful Bill will make that influence worse.

There's one section of the bill that's directly about AI, which is the proposed moratorium on most state-level attempts to regulate AI for the next 10 years. Originally, this was an outright ban, but because of the limits on what reconciliation bills can do on non-budgetary matters — and attempting to regulate regulation is clearly non-budgetary — it now takes the form of a requirement that states abstain from regulation if they want to get broadband money.

There are reasonable arguments that AI policy should happen at a federal, rather than state, level. But this isn't a case where the federal government has a well-reasoned policy framework that it seeks to impose instead of the states' policies. This is a case where the federal government wants to remove or prevent state regulations and replace them with nothing at all.

It's not surprising that corporate interests like the venture capital fund Andreesen Horowitz are ramping up their DC lobbying effort amid this fight. AI will change our lives quite fast. The public is already very suspicious of it and will want regulation, demands that are only set to grow as the near-term economic and labor effects of AI become palpable. The only way for the industry to prevent this is to lock in a laissez-faire regime right now. If you think there's even a chance that these systems could cause serious problems worthy of regulation, this is a very dangerous provision. Thankfully, even quite conservative Republicans in both houses seem to be realizing this, and hopefully that backlash kills the provision.

Almost as relevant to the industry are provisions slashing subsidies for clean energy development. Training and deploying AI requires a lot of data centers full of very expensive chips that need to be running 24/7 to pay back their immense upfront cost. Those centers need equally reliable, 24/7 sources of power. Ideally, that comes from clean sources like nuclear, geothermal, or solar-plus-batteries. Slightly worse would be natural gas. Much worse would be coal.

The reconciliation bill takes a number of actions to lower the odds that data centers are fueled by clean sources. It of course slashes the generous subsidies the Inflation Reduction Act created to encourage clean energy, which can offset as much as 30 percent of the cost of a new power plant.

The nuclear industry, the clean source to which Republicans are usually friendliest, has warned that the cuts could seriously hurt them as well. The bill also takes a hatchet to the Loan Programs Office, an Energy Department tool for investing in clean energy that's especially important for nuclear and geothermal. Energy Secretary Chris Wright went so far as to ask Republicans to dial back the cuts to nuclear and geothermal; I don't think a cabinet member has asked for smaller cuts in any other section of the bill, but this was concerning enough to spark intervention.

As policy analysts Thomas Hochman and Pavan Venkatakrishnan noted in the Washington Post, Congress's “approach almost uniquely disadvantages newer competing energy sources that run 24/7,” hurting them even more than wind and solar. It's almost like it's designed to make new data centers run on dirty fuels, or perhaps to encourage companies to build them abroad.

But the big, big problem with the bill is its obsession with larding on more onerous, poorly administered, ineffective work requirements on programs like Medicaid and food stamps.

I thought these were bad policies before AI became a big deal, and I am happy to rant at length about why. They're cruel, they do not lead people to work more, and for Medicaid in particular, even conservatives who normally like work requirements accept they're totally ineffective.

But back up for just one second. Right now, the leaders of the world's AI companies are declaring that within the decade, they will be able to fully automate a huge share of human labor. Maybe you think they're out of their gourds and nothing remotely like that will happen. It's possible. It's also possible that these incredibly powerful people with many billions of dollars at their disposal will be able to succeed at what they set out to do.

It's also possible that even much, much less powerful AIs, like those available today, will eventually cause meaningful employment loss. We're seeing some indications that's already happening. In even the absolute slowest plausible timeline for AI that I can imagine, you still will have companies like Waymo using it to displace human labor in specific industries.

In a world where Uber and truck drivers are suddenly out of work due to no fault of their own, adding work requirements to food stamps and Medicaid is cruel. It won't cause them to find work, at least in the near term; the work in their vocation is gone. Perhaps they should change occupations — but are we really confident their new job won't be automated the same way? Do they not need some help as they transition?

Vice President JD Vance gave a speech in March where he reminisced about the steel plant in his Ohio hometown, saying, “it was the lifeblood of the town that I grew up in. When it went from 10,000 jobs to 2,000 jobs, the American working people started to get destroyed in the process. We can't keep doing that.” 

But his party's budget bill does exactly that. It sees people whose livelihood might be destroyed imminently and actively takes support away from them. “We can't keep doing that”? You're doing that right now.

In a world of truly transformative AI, automating 10 or 20 or perhaps even 100 percent of human labor, work requirements go from cruel to some combination of cruel, bizarre, and silly. They'd be like if Congress were, today, to pass a dedicated law setting labor standards for horse-and-buggy drivers. Imagine telling folks in a world of transformative AI “you have to work to get food stamps.” Work? What work? Unemployment is 30 percent and rising, what are you even talking about?

David Sacks, a venture capitalist and one of Trump's closest advisers on AI, has generally been dismissive about the potential of AI to threaten jobs. But even he conceded on a recent episode of his All In podcast, “If there is widespread job disruption, then obviously the government's going to have to react and we're going to be in a very different societal order.”

At the same time, on X, he's declaring, “The future of AI has become a Rorschach test where everyone sees what they want. The Left envisions a post-economic order in which people stop working and instead receive government benefits. In other words, everyone on welfare. This is their fantasy; it's not going to happen.”

Fine, you don't want that. But AI will certainly displace many jobs if not eliminate them, and Sacks himself admits you need massive government intervention in that case. I don't have a clear idea what that intervention would ideally look like; we know so little about how this technology is going to diffuse through society, how fast it will improve, and what this means for jobs. It's an area that needs far more attention, from AI companies, governments, and civil society.

But I feel confident on one point. AI is going to make some employment more precarious. Occupations will be threatened. People will lose their jobs. The questions are how many of them will, and whether and how quickly they'll get new ones.

Given all that, adding new work requirements to safety net programs isn't just cruel or unwise. It's a sign that this administration, and its tech advisers like Sacks, do not take the future of AI seriously at all.

How to navigate a world where MAHA is setting vaccine policy.

For the past 60 years, a committee of independent experts has advised the federal government on vaccine policy, providing guidance on which shots people should get and when. Government public health officials have almost always followed the panel's recommendations, all but making it the final word on public health policy in the US for most of its existence. And over those decades, the United States has made tremendous health gains over that time through mass vaccination campaigns.

But on Monday, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired every sitting member of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a move that stunned doctors and scientists across the country. And it means that the CDC's days as the clear and unchallenged authority on US vaccine policy appear numbered.

“Up until today, ACIP recommendations were the gold standard for what insurers should pay for, what providers should recommend, and what the public should look to,” Noel Brewer, a health behavior professor at the University of North Carolina, who was a member of the panel until this week, told the Associated Press. “It's unclear what the future holds.”

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

New committee members will be announced at some point, but as of Tuesday morning, even top US senators did not know who the replacements would be. The panel is supposed to hold one of its periodic public meetings in late June to discuss the Covid-19 vaccine, as well as shots for RSV and HPV, among others. 

This is a watershed moment in US public health, one that seems sure to sow confusion among patients and health care providers. The deepening divide between Kennedy's Make American Healthy Again (MAHA) movement and mainstream medicine could make it harder for people who want vaccines to get them, while encouraging more doubt about the value and safety of shots among the general public. Here's what you need to know.

The vaccine advisory committee was first convened by the surgeon general in 1964, but it is not enshrined in federal law. That means that Kennedy — as the top official at the US Department of Health and Human Services, which contains the CDC — can change its membership or dissolve the panel entirely if he so desires. 

Kennedy framed his decision to clear out the members as necessary to restore public trust in the government's vaccine recommendations. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Kennedy asserted the committee “has been plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.” 

It may be a little “hot dog guy meme” that the man who may have done more than any other person to erode public trust in vaccines is now complaining about the problem of eroding public trust in vaccines. But it fits with his broader critique of the medical establishment being beholden to big business interests at the expense of patients, a critique that many Americans share. Kennedy has said mainstream scientists — the kind who staffed ACIP before this week — have been too deferential to pharma companies and too reluctant to consider vaccines' supposed harms, including the long-debunked claim that vaccines can cause autism, which Kennedy has pushed for years.

As health secretary, he has made overhauling vaccine policy a centerpiece of his agenda, both through his rhetoric and policy. Over the past few months, while the worst measles outbreak in 30 years has spread through the US, Kennedy has equivocated in public comments on the value of the measles vaccine, which doctors say is far and away the best tool to combat the disease. He directed an anti-vaccine researcher to scour federal data for evidence of a vaccine-autism link. His department's recent MAHA report on childhood chronic disease named vaccines as one example of how the US overmedicalizes its children and exposes them to artificial agents that could do harm to their body.

Then in late May, Kennedy oversaw a revision of the federal government's Covid-19 vaccine guidance, limiting the shots to elderly people and those who are immunocompromised. He ended the recommendation that pregnant women and kids get a Covid vaccine shot, even though studies have shown they help confer immunity to infants, who are at a higher risk from the virus and cannot be vaccinated until they are 6 months old. The move plainly circumvented ACIP's accepted role in setting vaccine policy, presaging this week's mass firing.

Whatever his intentions, Kennedy's gutting of the federal vaccine committee seems likely to sow even more distrust — and certainly more confusion. People are reasonably left to wonder whether they can trust forthcoming CDC guidance on vaccines, and just what vaccines they'll be able to get.

In the past, ACIP would typically meet a few times a year to discuss any additions or changes to the country's vaccine schedule. Their recommendations have usually been adopted without alterations by the CDC director, and then became the standard for state and local health departments across the country. Importantly, most health plans are required to cover any shots that the committee recommends. 

Now there is far more uncertainty. Will doctors follow the CDC guidance, even if it changes under a new advisory panel staffed by Kennedy loyalists, or will they stick with the earlier vaccine schedule? Will health insurance plans cover the cost of a vaccine that professional medical organizations support but the CDC does not? Once-unthinkable questions could soon be something doctors and patients must deal with every day.

Some doctors already believed, before the firings at ACIP, that the CDC was no longer trustworthy under Kennedy's leadership; his unilateral change to the Covid vaccine guidance in May was enough to convince them. In a media call last week, experts from the Infectious Disease Society of America urged patients and providers in the short term to consult with professional medical societies — not the CDC — on vaccine recommendations. They considered those groups, as well as guidance from European health authorities, the best substitutes we currently have for information on vaccines if the CDC's recommendations can no longer be taken at face value.

“It's been a confusing several days, confusing last two weeks, and I'm not sure that confusion is going to be abated in the near future,” John Lynch, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Washington, said on the call. 

Lynch said that he tells his own colleagues to consult with the IDSA, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG). There are already differences emerging: Kennedy recently nixed the government's recommendation that pregnant women get the Covid-19 vaccine, while ACOG continues to recommend it because the mother can pass on immunity to their child. And more could surface: The AAP currently recommends Gardasil for the HPV virus, which has proven successful in preventing cervical cancer, but Kennedy has expressed concerns about its safety.

“These are evidence-based guidelines developed by experts in the field using transparent methods and published publicly,” Lynch said.

Kennedy, in explaining his change to the Covid vaccine guidelines, said he wanted to encourage shared decision-making between providers and their patients. The CDC guidance would be only one consideration in the decision whether to vaccinate, rather than a firm recommendation. The doctors from the IDSA said that such conversations are already to be considered best practice among physicians — and noted Kennedy's undermining of trust in the federal vaccine policy would now make them more important. 

“I would just emphasize the need to have a good source of information when this situation occurs. If indeed shared decision making is going to occur, we always do our research,” Dr. Flor Muñoz-Rivas at Baylor College of Medicine said. “But go to the proper sources.” 

There is a lot we don't know right now: Who will be named to the new panel? Will they change existing vaccine recommendations? Will they approve new ones? But the experts warned that Kennedy's rhetoric alone risks undermining people's confidence in vaccinations.

“All health care decisions are shared decision-making; this is not a special concept that's only rolled out for conversations like vaccination,” Lynch said on the IDSA call. “As an infectious disease doctor, when I talk to a patient about treatment or diagnostics, it is a conversation. It is shared decision-making.”

Kennedy has quickly disrupted decades of public health consensus.

Anyone who watched the sometimes contentious ACIP meetings during the pandemic saw the members grappling with genuinely vexing questions about who should be prioritized for vaccination in a public health emergency. The pandemic featured rare examples of Biden CDC director Rochelle Walensky overruling the panel in certain cases in which the experts actually recommended against more vaccinations. (Walensky said she overrode the guidance to align the CDC with a separate recommendation from the FDA's advisory committee, and cited the narrow 9-6 vote against the recommendation.) Those scenes should have helped dispel the notion that they were acting as a rubber-stamp for any new shot Big Pharma produced.

But the nation's top health official is now telling Americans that they should never have trusted the ACIP, which risks pushing more people to skip routine immunization. Shortly after the country declared measles eradicated in 2000, 94 percent of adults said childhood immunizations were extremely or very important. But that consensus has since weakened: 69 percent of Americans said the same in 2024. If changing opinion leads to declining vaccination rates, diseases that we successfully stamped out through vaccines to rebound — which is exactly what we are seeing now with measles. 

The US is experiencing its highest number of measles cases since the 1990s, nearing 1,200 as of this writing. One outbreak that accounts for most of those cases took off in a small Texas community where vaccination rates had fallen far below the 95-percent threshold that is considered necessary to stop the virus's spread.

Other knock on effects could hurt Americans who still want to get vaccinated. Pharma companies, the target of so much of Kennedy's criticism, could decide to stop pursuing new vaccines if they believe the federal government will limit access as much as possible, shrinking the world's biggest pharmaceutical market. Vaccines are not big moneymakers for drug companies, and they have often relied on the US government's support to develop new ones. 

Kennedy, however, has canceled major vaccine development contracts during his first few months as health secretary, including a $700 million contract with Moderna, one of two companies that produced the mRNA Covid vaccines, to work on a universal flu shot.

Kennedy has quickly disrupted decades of public health consensus. For now, the best reaction is, oddly enough, for patients and providers to take him at his word when he says people should not take medical advice from him — and make their own decisions in collaboration with their doctors.

﻿This is what it's like to witness ICE raids and protests unfold in the city I was born and raised in.

My mom has been a housekeeper for as long as I can remember. As a child, I'd accompany her on the bus to the houses she cleaned, impressed with how it seemed like she knew just about everyone en route to their own jobs. There was always friendly acknowledgment and solidarity — especially with those in restaurant uniforms or carrying their own cleaning supplies. 

Some of the people she befriended became trusted confidants she'd recruit to help with strenuous cleaning gigs and eventually help land custodial jobs with the city of Los Angeles. Many years later, these individuals would pool together money to ensure I didn't fly across the country to an internship in New York City empty-handed, even though they didn't have much to give. Getting a front-row seat to the community my mom built with others who worked low-wage jobs with long hours — for a shot at not just a better life for their families but for survival — was one of the most special acts of camaraderie I've had the privilege to witness. 

My mom never complained. Neither did her friends. Their resilience, both mental and physical, taught me to acknowledge people who so often get overlooked. I thought of them as I said hello to the custodians who worked early mornings and late nights at the University of Southern California while I attended school there. I thought of them as I translated the news for social media posts in my previous job at the Los Angeles Times, understanding that language barriers can make receiving quality information much harder. And I thought of them and others who had taken similar journeys to LA as US Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducts aggressive immigration raids throughout the city. 

In the last few weeks, ICE has intensified its operations throughout the US. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller urged immigration enforcement to make at least 3,000 arrests a day. The Trump administration has frequently targeted “sanctuary jurisdictions” with large immigrant populations like Los Angeles, arguing they are getting in the way of its campaign promise to deport millions of people.

Thousands of demonstrators protested ICE and its raids over the weekend, leading to clashes with the police, and President Donald Trump deploying the National Guard to LA. As of Tuesday, the administration has also sent in around 700 Marines. Images of Los Angeles Police Department officers in riot gear, demonstrators blocking the 101 freeway, infographics with resources for undocumented immigrants, and arrests flooded my social media feeds. A video of a man being detained by ICE outside of his workplace went viral. His daughter, who filmed the post, cries in the background, telling him how much she loves him while reminding him of his rights. As she tries to plead with him, he remains calm. His bravery reminded me of my mom, whose quiet demeanor eclipses the sacrifices she's made to give her five children a better life. 

In the wake of the protests, Trump posted on Truth Social, “A once great American City, Los Angeles, has been invaded and occupied by Illegal Aliens and Criminals. Now violent, insurrectionist mobs are swarming and attacking our Federal Agents to try and stop our deportation operations — But these lawless riots only strengthen our resolve...”

The LA I know, the city I grew up in and care deeply about, hasn't been “invaded” and isn't a “lawless” place that requires federal force. While so much media focuses on protests, further legitimizing Trump's war zone narrative, an important story is being overlooked: immigrants, like many detained outside of their workplaces, and like my mom, have quietly built this city.

More immigrants live in California than in any other state. Undocumented immigrants including those in California collectively paid $96.7 billion in taxes in 2022, all while being generally unable to access services their taxes help fund, like Medicaid and housing assistance. Over one in three Angelenos are immigrants, and while estimates vary, there could be about 1 million undocumented LA residents. 

And there is no LA without Latinos. The city was originally a part of Mexico, and Latino influence remains a cornerstone of its identity. Its namesake, neighborhoods, and street names (Los Feliz, San Pedro, La Cienega, La Brea, and more) reflect its Spanish-speaking origins. Olvera Street, the colorful marketplace, and Union Station, a transit hub that combines modern and Latin architectural styles, are only two examples of culturally significant landmarks. Latinos comprise almost half of the Los Angeles Dodgers' fan base and have endearingly called the team “Los Doyers” for decades. The late baseball star Fernando Valenzuela was a pitching pioneer in Major League Baseball. The city, known as a major culinary destination, boasts all kinds of regional Mexican and Central American cuisines. You can find Oaxacan tlayudas, Sinaloan aguachiles, Salvadoran pupusas, and Guatemalan tamales all within a 30-minute radius. 

In that same Truth Social post, Trump wrote that Los Angeles would be set free. But how could it be liberated from the same generations of people who continue to help define it? 

These workers, whose invisible labor supports the state's infrastructure, are not a monolith. They fill vital roles as students, teachers, business owners, housekeepers, landscapers, caretakers, staff, and more. They are often assumed to be recent arrivals, but more than two-thirds of undocumented residents have been in the US for more than a decade. About 14 percent of California's population either lacks legal status or lives with undocumented family members. According to the Public Policy Institute, the majority of Californians want pathways for noncitizens to obtain legal status. Yet despite the combination of public support and some statewide programs offering public benefits to undocumented immigrants, the pathway to legal citizenship remains complicated and unattainable for many. Meanwhile, ICE continues to carry out Trump's mass deportation plans in Southern California. 

Contrary to what some headlines might suggest, the backlash on LA's streets and displays of support online are unsurprising. There's a long history of social justice activism here: demands for educational equity in the East Los Angeles walkouts in 1968, solidarity with farmworker strikes demanding better labor conditions in the '70s, the 1992 Rodney King uprising against police brutality, and protests in 2020 following George Floyd's murder. What's being demonstrated now is a city united with people who aren't invaders or occupants, but who are LA. 

There are too many stereotypes about Los Angeles to count. One commonly heard narrative, likely from the influx of transplants coming to take advantage of the entertainment industry, presumes that so many people are driven by their own personal gains, and are too unwilling to venture outside of their affluent neighborhoods to care about others on a macro level. This couldn't be further from the truth.

Earlier this year, California experienced the Eaton and Palisades fires. In the aftermath of the tragedy, Angelenos banded together to support their communities. Volunteers assembled food packages and sorted through donations. Several local restaurants offered free food to victims and first responders. Countless grassroots efforts directly supported displaced individuals. 

This sense of empathy isn't limited to large-scale catastrophes. I live in the South Bay, where people are eager to support their villages. They contribute to GoFundMes to help alleviate hospital bills and funeral expenses. They support small businesses, volunteer their time at fundraisers, participate in meal trains, and share helpful events and resources on their social media profiles.

There's a painful disconnect between sensationalized storytelling and the Los Angeles I've known and lived in for my entire life. As I scroll through videos of vandalism outside city hall, officers teargassing protesters, and children terrified about where their parents are headed to, I can't help but feel both immense grief and anger. It's easy for cameras to capture chaos and unrest, rather than the circumstances that led people to leave their country of origin. It's easy for trolls online to suggest that people should have come here legally, without acknowledging the intricate process and undocumented immigrants' predisposition to exploitation. 

Stories about immigrants are not always afforded nuance. Their humanity is stripped as they are categorized into political talking points or condensed into data figures. The actions they've taken to change the trajectory of their families' lives are what many others would do in their position, but are judged differently because of the framing. The lives they actually live — the callouses they've developed on their hands after years of labor many couldn't imagine undertaking, the people they make laugh, the motivations that drive them, their homesickness for places that don't exist anymore — are often ignored. It hurts because I am familiar with the people behind the headlines. They raised me.

As news coverage and political figures paint my hometown as a disorderly battleground overrun with “illegals,” I wish they could understand the LA I know and am proud to live in. It's where people acknowledge those who quietly live up to the American ethos of pulling themselves up by their bootstraps despite not living in a meritocracy, with little recognition and not even so much as a “hello” in passing. It's where camaraderie runs deep, whether people are contributing to mutual aid funds or ensuring their friend's daughter gets to pursue her dreams in a state they might never visit. Los Angeles's foundation is made up of people like my mom, who understand hardship, but continue to choose generosity instead.

Correction, June 11, 12 pm ET: A previous version of this story misstated how much undocumented immigrants paid in taxes in 2022. They collectively paid $96.7 billion in taxes that year.

﻿Romance and friendship don't have to be at odds.

Like many Americans, the writer Rhaina Cohen is shopping for a home. Unlike many Americans, she's searching for a house to live in with her friends and their families, a unique setup that sometimes raises eyebrows. One recent interaction with her realtor crystalized the disparate attitudes many people hold toward friendship versus romantic relationships. 

After she explained that the home would be occupied by a group of friends, the realtor told Cohen that whenever he attempts to hang out with his own friends, they question whether he really loves his wife and kids. As if by spending time with friends, he must be denouncing his family. 

“It was really interesting to see him observe this different model than what my friends and I were trying to create, which did not pit marriage and a nuclear family against friendship, but saw them as compatible,” says Cohen, the author of The Other Significant Others: Reimagining Life With Friendship at the Center. 

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

We live in a culture that often places paramount importance on romantic relationships, sometimes at the cost of friendships. Entire genres of movies and books feature love interests as the driving narrative that lead to a happy ending or offer advice on how to land a romantic partner. Dating apps are plentiful, while similar platforms for friendship are lacking. 

Another study concluded that when people enter into romantic relationships, they lose two close friendships.

This societally enforced dichotomy has real-life effects: One study found that living with a partner pushes friends away. Another concluded that when people enter into romantic relationships, they lose two close friendships. More and more, the roles of spouse and best friend are merging into one person who is expected to fulfill both platonic and romantic duties. But research shows people who have non-romantic best friends report greater feelings of social support compared to those whose spouses are their best friends. 

Cohen's reporting, as well as her own experiences, highlights friendships so deep that, by some standards, they could be considered as intimate as marriage. In the past, these relationships wouldn't be controversial or unique, but in today's romance-first culture, platonic and romantic love can seem at odds. But they don't have to be.

Just as the roles of romantic partners have evolved over time, so have the roles of friends. Renaissance-era men lived alongside and with their friends and spoke lovingly about them in ways we only associate with romantic partners today. By the 1800s, men were photographed arm-in-arm, holding hands, sitting on each other's laps; women wrote passionately to their friends, using terms like “Dearest darling,” or “my beloved.” Marriage, meanwhile, was an economic institution meant to shore up property, resources, and family labor.

The scales started to shift in favor of romantic partners as marriage took on more significance, Cohen says. Women began to enter education and work environments in the 1920s, and came into greater contact with men. As a result, the institution of dating as we know it was born. Dating, inevitably, took time away from friendship. Marriage got a lot more romantic and spouses, in turn, came to depend on their partner for emotional support. 

At the same time, shifting cultural norms around sexuality weaponized affection between same-sex friends. The labels of “homosexuality” and “heterosexuality” emerged around the turn of the 20th century, Cohen says, and passionate love for friends was inherently sexualized and stigmatized. 

These days, Cohen says, “we place unnecessary limits on friendship,” because society sees platonic bonds as second-best. There are systemic reasons for this hierarchy — friends have few legal protections compared to the rights of spouses. Culturally, living a good life for many means getting married and having children. 

Marriage has taken on even more significance in recent years, given the expectation that your partner will also be your best friend. Many think that a spouse or romantic partner should fulfill all of their emotional needs. In reality, having close friends is better for your mental health long-term than a romantic relationship. A supportive partner should also encourage connections outside the relationship.

It's not uncommon to experience a sense of loss when a close friend marries.

Having your romantic partner also be your best friend, co-parent, roommate, and sole confidant is a lot of pressure. They become the default plus-one to all events, the implied person with whom you spend weekends and vacations. “If you want your partner to be your partner and your best friend and fulfill all of these roles, that takes a lot of time and energy and resources,” says Jaimie Arona Krems, an associate professor of psychology and the director of the UCLA Center for Friendship Research.

With all that time dedicated to romance, friendships suffer. There simply aren't enough hours in the day to devote to platonic relationships if all of your time is dedicated to a romantic one. Those who retreat into coupledom may find themselves with far fewer friends on the other side.

Many people are aware of this shift and can become territorial when a friend starts dating someone new. It's not uncommon to experience a sense of loss when a close friend marries. For uncoupled friends, being the only single one is alienating enough. It's difficult to feel like you play second fiddle to your friend's romantic partner, too. 

Feelings of jealousy or sadness shouldn't be cause for shame, Krems says. “People readily admit that they feel jealous when somebody is interested in their partner, or they think that their partner is interested in someone else,” she says, “but they much less readily admit it amongst friends.” Not only is jealousy common in these situations, Krems says, but it's provoked when you suspect you might be replaced, whether by a romantic partner or another friend.

When friendships feel threatened, you might engage in what Krems calls “friend guarding” behaviors, which don't necessarily need to be negative (like undermining your friend's relationship). In fact, this jealousy can motivate people to be more intentional with their friends, Krems found in a study. If you suspect you're becoming one of the casualties of a friend's new relationship, there's time to act and get a hangout on the calendar. “Jealousy can be a signal to us that we value this person,” Krems says. “We want to be intentional about maintaining them in [our] lives.” 

There is a world in which we see the people in our lives as individuals with distinct but equal roles. For instance, if a friend is under the weather, don't make the assumption that their partner should be the only person to care for them, Cohen says. Not only does showing up for your friends deepen your relationship, but extra support removes some of the pressure on partners to be solely responsible for their spouse.

We can also reimagine free time as something worth spending not just with family and other couples but friends, too. “In the limited vacation time that people in the US have,” Cohen says, “it is okay to spend some of that vacation time not with your spouse, not with a romantic partner.” Invite a pal on a family trip, throw a party for both single and partnered guests, join an adult dodgeball team with work friends. 

If you feel yourself getting jealous over a friend's divided attention, take it as a cue that they matter to you. You might need to be the one who frequently initiates plans, but that's friendship. It takes effort and is not always perfectly balanced — but it's worth it. 

A friend-focused life requires rethinking your identity not as a unit of “we” but as a vital component of a myriad of relationships, and adjusting your expectations accordingly. Maybe Saturday is date night and Wednesday you cook dinner with your closest friends, and one Thursday a month is for book club. Sometimes your partner's needs will supersede a friend's. Other times the opposite might be true. Everyone gets their time in the spotlight. No one is second place.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Why one economist says the labor market is far weaker than it seems","https://www.businessinsider.com/us-economic-outlook-job-market-hiring-data-revisions-tariffs-inflation-2025-6","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 16:41:00 GMT","

Last Friday's jobs report was upbeat, but the numbers might not be telling the whole story, one economist warns.

Samuel Tombs, Chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, sees a labor market struggling with softening hiring and an accelerating trend of downward revisions.

In May, 139,000 jobs were added, beating the 125,000 consensus estimate, but that was overshadowed somewhat by sharp revisions to prior months' data. March's initial figure of 224,000 payrolls added has since been nearly slashed in half, down to 120,000.

It's likely that May's figure is inflated, too, Tombs said.

""We expect May's number to be revised down to about 100,000 by the third estimate, published in early August,"" Tombs wrote in a recent note.

Since January 2023, downward revisions between the intial and third estimates for each month have averaged 30,000.

The frequency of downward revisions could be due to reporting by small businesses filing payroll data late, Tombs said. Smaller companies are often hit the hardest by high interest rates and tariff costs.

""Small businesses are really the canary in the coal mine in this downturn,"" Tombs told BI. ""They don't have the financial capacity to deal with many of the upfront costs that are involved with tariffs. They still face very high borrowing costs, so they are very, very cautious with both their hiring and capex decisions going forward.""

Tombs sees continued weakness in the retail, wholesale, and transport and logistics sectors, and expects employment in those parts of the economy to fall by 50,000 by year-end due to a reduction in the ""pull-forward effect"" from tariffs, which saw many businesses and consumers rush to spend money ahead of tariff-related price hikes.

On top of the revisions, hiring also appeared poised to slow. The NFIB small business hiring intentions index slipped to its lowest level since May 2020, and regional Fed surveys suggest continued declines in service-sector employment outside healthcare and education.

""Of all the indicators that we track, it is the best singular indicator of payroll growth that we've found in the last three years,"" Tombs said of the NFIB survey.

In the chart below, hiring intentions tracked by regional Fed surveys are weaker than the 2015 to 2024 average. Actual job growth in the private services sector tends to move closely with hiring intentions, meaning that when hiring intentions fall, actual hiring tends to drop shortly after.

Tombs believes government jobs will also continue to decline after their DOGE gutting as federal employees who accepted a voluntary buyout get removed from the payroll in September — they've fallen by 59,000 this year, including by 22,000 in May.

On this trajectory, Tombs expects the unemployment rate to peak at 4.8% by December.

This year, the Fed has been in wait-and-see mode when it comes to cutting rates, and some strategists believe it's prioritizing bringing inflation down before turning to expansionary monetary policy. But these factors point to a labor market that's weaker than it seems, and Tombs believes the Fed will need to start cutting rates in September to provide relief for businesses, before inflation peaks.

Surviving the gruelling hours and high demands of a job in consulting isn't easy.

Deloitte has a new solution to help its employees handle the stress: Lego.

The Big Four professional services firm has updated its long-running well-being subsidy program to include ""Legos and puzzles"" on a list of items that Deloitte will reimburse, internal policy documents seen by Business Insider show.

The firm has long offered eligible US staff an annual subsidy to spend on one or a combination of subscriptions, equipment, and experiences. In 2021, the firm doubled the allowance from $500 to $1,000, an internal webpage shows.

The subsidy is meant to ""empower and support your journey toward thriving mentally, physically, and financially and living your purpose,"" the policy documents say.

Most partners and salaried workers are offered the benefit. Interns, contracted professionals, and employees on a leave of absence are not eligible.

One Deloitte US employee told BI that people were discussing the new updates in internal team chats.

""Most of the responses are things like 'Lego?!?!? Finally!' or jokes about how they can now rationalize buying the coveted Millennium Falcon Star Wars Lego set,"" the employee said.

Lego's most expensive set, the Star Wars Ultimate Collector Series Millennium Falcon, costs $850, leaving Deloitte workers with a small allowance left over to spend on other qualifying items like fencing classes or neck pillows.

A second Deloitte employee told BI that they see the subsidy as a nod of appreciation from the company for dealing with the stress and frustrations of their job.

""This makes a huge difference! I personally like to think of what I need/want for the next subsidy. I have been able to upgrade my workspace, and it helps with the work intake,"" the person said.

They added that Lego was receiving a lot of attention in the office, as it was a departure from the basics. ""Knocking out a four-hour Lego build in under two hours is a great stress reliever,"" the employee said.

Lego is just one of several new additions to the list of approved items, which were updated on June 1, the start of Deloitte's financial year.

Under a section titled ""what's new for FY26"" are kitchenware and kitchen appliances (e.g., blender, refrigerator), spa services like facials and body treatments, personal portable cooling fans, and ergonomic, cooling, and sleeping pillows.

Employees can also spend the subsidy on items like office furniture, gym equipment, financial support apps, fitness classes, and gaming consoles, including the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation.

Deloitte US did not respond to a request for comment from BI.

Not all are as positive about the subsidy program, with one Deloitte US employee telling BI they think it is only given ""because of how much this job sucks.""

The US division of Deloitte has faced a challenging period after its contracts with the government came under scrutiny as part of the White House Office's efforts to cut federal spending.

By April, at least 127 of the firm's government contracts had been cut or modified, according to BI's analysis of data on the DOGE website.

That month, Deloitte Consulting CEO Jason Salzetti said in an internal meeting that a ""small percentage"" of workers in the firm's government division would be laid off. Employees told BI that DOGE's actions had shifted the climate at Deloitte.

The US branch of Deloitte had 172,800 employees in 2024, when it last reported head count.

The latest game in BioWare's fantasy role-playing series went through ten years of development turmoil

The failure of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, released in October, led EA to gut BioWare

In early November, on the eve of the crucial holiday shopping season, staffers at the video-game studio BioWare were feeling optimistic. After an excruciating development cycle, they had finally released their latest game, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and the early reception was largely positive. The role-playing game was topping sales charts on Steam, and solid, if not spectacular, reviews were rolling in. 

But in the weeks that followed, the early buzz cooled as players delved deeper into the fantasy world, and some BioWare employees grew anxious. For months, everyone at the subsidiary of the video-game publisher Electronic Arts Inc. had been under intense pressure. The studio's previous two games, Mass Effect: Andromeda and Anthem, had flopped, and there were rumors that if Dragon Age underperformed, BioWare might become another of EA's many casualties.

US Inflation:

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent credited President Donald Trump's policies for a slowdown in US inflation, and said he had challenged a “decades-old status quo” on trade.

“Inflation in the US is at its slowest pace since 2021 on decelerating cost increases for shelter, food and energy,” Bessent said in testimony prepared for a House Ways and Means Committee hearing. Earlier Wednesday, new data showed underlying inflation rose in May by less than forecast for the fourth month in a row.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang projected that Europe's artificial-intelligence computing capacity will increase by a factor of ten over the next two years, with more than 20 so-called AI factories in the works.

“Europe has now awakened to the importance of these AI factories,” said Huang, whose company is supplying chips for virtually every major AI-computing project. Several of massive data centers will have more than a gigawatt of capacity, potentially ranking them among the largest in the world, he said during a company event jointly held with the VivaTech tech conference in Paris.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Wednesday that U.S. tariff levels on Chinese imports will not change from their current levels, even as a trade deal between Washington and Beijing has yet to be finalized.

Asked on CNBC's ""Money Movers"" if the current U.S. tariffs on China are not going to change again, Lutnick replied, ""You can definitely say that.""

President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post Wednesday morning that U.S. duties on China will total 55% — but a White House official told CNBC soon after that that figure is not new.

Rather, it comprises the existing 30% blanket U.S. tariffs on China, plus the 25% tariffs on specific products that also were already in place, the official said.

Trump sent his all-caps post hours after Lutnick and other trade negotiators for the two economic superpowers concluded high-level talks in London.

The president said the deal is ""done,"" but added that it is still ""subject to final approval"" between himself and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Trump said China's tariffs on the U.S. will stay at 10%, where they have stood since both sides agreed last month to temporarily pare back retaliatory duties on each others' goods.

That 90-day reprieve came after initial talks in Geneva, Switzerland, that yielded a tentative de-escalation on tariffs but left other key sticking points unclear.

Trump in Wednesday's post also wrote that ""full magnets, and any necessary rare earths, will be supplied, up front, by China"" as a result of the London talks.

In a follow-up, he wrote, ""President XI and I are going to work closely together to open up China to American Trade.""

Lutnick said on CNBC that the takeaway from this week's negotiations was that ""they set up the Geneva truce.""

Beijing was ""slow-rolling"" its export of rare earths, prompting retaliation from Washington — including a crackdown on visas for Chinese students at U.S. universities, Lutnick said.

""We were at mutual assured annoyance,"" the secretary said. But Trump's one-on-one phone call with Xi last week ""changed everything,"" Lutnick said.

""They are going to approve all applications for magnets from United States companies right away,"" he said.

But Lutnick's optimism papered over unanswered questions that importers have about China's promises.

For example, China has agreed to issue only temporary, six-month licenses to U.S. companies seeking to import rare-earth minerals and magnets from China, The Wall Street Journal reported.

This would allow Beijing to revisit its decision to issue any given license every six months, creating uncertainty in the supply chain for U.S. companies.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Lutnick's remarks, or for additional details on the London agreement terms.

The entire Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board resigned over what it said Wednesday was meddling by the Trump administration in the board's authority to award scholarships.

The 12-member board, in a statement, said the State Department, which runs the scholarship program, had denied Fulbright awards ""to a substantial number of individuals who were selected for the 2025-2026 academic year."" 

""The administration is also currently subjecting an additional 1,200 foreign Fulbright recipients to an unauthorized review process and could reject more,"" the board said in its statement, which was posted on Substack.

""We believe these actions not only contradict the statute but are antithetical to the Fulbright mission and the values, including free speech and academic freedom, that Congress specified in the statute,"" the board said.

Jed Katz, the chair of the board and managing director of Javelin Venture Partners, , referred CNBC to the statement when asked about his and the other members' resignations.

Like every other member of the board, Katz was appointed to the panel by former President Joe Biden.

The other board members who resign include people who served in Biden's administration, among them Mala Adiga, who was a deputy assistant to Biden, former White House deputy chief of staff Jen O'Malley Dillon, who chaired Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign, and former Biden speechwriter Vinay Reddy.

CNBC has requested comment from the State Department.

The resignations were first reported by The New York Times.

""Effective immediately, members of the Congressionally mandated Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board voted overwhelmingly to resign from the board, rather than endorse unprecedented actions that we believe are impermissible under the law, compromise U.S. national interests and integrity, and undermine the mission and mandates Congress established for the Fulbright program nearly 80 years ago,"" the board said in its statement.

""At the program's inception, Congress clearly specified that the Fulbright Board has final approval authority of applicants, which occurs after an exhaustive and deliberate, year-long process led by non-partisan career staff at the State Department and Embassies around the world,"" the board said.

The impacts of the pandemic-era government spending and monetary policy that helped support the U.S. economy have faded, and that makes the country vulnerable to a downturn in the coming months, according to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.

""I think there's a chance real numbers will deteriorate soon,"" Dimon said at a Morgan Stanley conference on Tuesday, according to a transcript from FactSet.

The U.S. has continued to see growth in total employment and consumer spending this year, even as survey data has shown weakening confidence in consumers and business leaders in the face of the Trump administration's tariff policies.

Dimon downplayed the survey data, saying that ""neither consumers nor businesses ever pick the inflection points,"" but said the economy's ""soft landing"" was likely to look weaker going forward.

""Employment will come down a little bit. Inflation will go up a little bit. Hopefully, it's just a little bit,"" he said, adding that lower levels of immigration is another complicating for the factor.

Dimon, who has been CEO of JPMorgan since 2006, has a history of sharing cautious or negative outlooks on the economy. His comments on Tuesday were not unusually pessimistic.

The most recent economic data shows both job growth and inflation slowed in May.

Another area that Dimon warned about was private credit, which has become a booming business on Wall Street and is seen as a potential area of concern in the event of a recession. The CEO explained that the risks of private credit are different for banks — which line up the deals and then move them off their books — and for investors who are looking for long-term returns from the asset class.

""Do I think that now is a good time to buy credit if I was a fund manager? No. I wouldn't be buying credit today at these prices and these spreads,"" Dimon said.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said China will supply rare earths up front to the U.S. as part of a trade agreement.

The relationship between the world's two largest economies is ""excellent,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social, while adding, ""WE ARE GETTING A TOTAL OF 55% TARIFFS, CHINA IS GETTING 10%.""

He added that magnets and ""any necessary rare earths"" will be supplied up front by China and that the U.S. will in turn make certain concessions such as allowing Chinese students to attend U.S. colleges and universities.

The agreement is subject to final approval with himself and China President Xi Jinping, the U.S. president said, adding he intends to work closely with Xi to open up China to American trade, describing the prospect as ""a great WIN for both countries!!!""

Representatives from both sides had on Tuesday revealed that a deal had been reached on trade after a second day of high-level talks in London.

""We have reached a framework to implement the Geneva consensus and the call between the two presidents,"" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters.

That echoed comments to reporters from Li Chenggang, China's international trade representative and a vice minister at China's Commerce Ministry.

Rare earth elements and magnets widely used by the automotive and defense sectors emerged as a key sticking point between the world's two largest economies.

China's Ministry of Commerce in early April imposed export restrictions on strategically important minerals in response to Trump's tariff increase on Beijing's exported products.

Both sides had accused each other of reneging on a preliminary trade deal struck in Switzerland last month. Investors, however, had remained hopeful of a breakthrough following last week's call between Trump and China's Xi.

China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, producing roughly 60% of the world's supply of rare earths and processing almost 90%, which means it is importing these materials from other countries and processing them.

U.S. officials have previously warned that this dominance poses a strategic challenge amid the pivot to more sustainable energy sources.

Trump's back-and-forth trade policies have roiled financial markets in recent months, sparking chaos in major ports and pushing global supply chains to the breaking point.

Oil prices popped shortly after Trump's social media post. International benchmark Brent crude futures with August delivery rose $1 a barrel to $67.87 on the news. The contract was last seen up around 1.8% for the session.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with July delivery, meanwhile, stood 2.2% higher at $66.42.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is growing more bullish about quantum computing — and he expects they'll start solving real-world problems in the coming years.

""Quantum computing is reaching an inflection point,"" Jensen declared during his keynote speech at Nvidia's GTC Paris developer conference Wednesday.

Quantum computers are machines that use the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers, which store information in bits (ones and zeroes).

Quantum computers use quantum bits, or ""qubits,"" which can be zero, one or something in between — the aim being to process much larger volumes of data to facilitate breakthroughs in areas like medicine, science and finance.

Quantum has been a buzzy space for investors with the rise of several popular stocks, such as Rigetti Computing and IonQ, which on Monday acquired Oxford Ionics for $1.1 billion. Shares of Rigetti and IonQ were up 4.5% and 3.7% respectively in U.S. premarket trading.

Huang on Wednesday said he's been impressed with the ""large community"" of quantum computing companies within Europe, adding that he'd met with representatives of French quantum startup Pasqal on Tuesday night.

""We are within reach"" of being able to apply quantum computers ""in areas that can solve some interesting problems in the coming years,"" Huang added, as he talked up Nvidia's own hybrid quantum-classical computing solution, Cuda Q. ""This is a really exciting time.""

This marks a more bullish view from the Nvidia boss on quantum, after Huang previously said he thinks a 15-year timeline for realizing useful quantum computers is ""on the early side,"" and that a 20-year timeframe was a likelier target.

His views at the time led to quantum computing stocks including Rigetti, IonQ and D-Wave Quantum plunging. More recently, Huang has admitted his comments came out wrong and expressed his surprise about the ensuing market movements.

Huang isn't alone in spotting the quantum computing hype. Late last year, Google announced its latest quantum chip, Willow, which it said marked a major breakthrough in so-called ""error correction"" — a set of techniques used to protect quantum information from errors.

In this article

Nvidia on Wednesday announced a slew of partnerships with European countries and companies spanning infrastructure to software as it looks to keep itself at the center of the global artificial intelligence story.

Chief Executive Jensen Huang on Wednesday continued his tour of Europe with a keynote at Nvidia's GTC event in Paris, France, where he laid out some key European partnerships.

Nvidia has been keen to position itself as an infrastructure company that can help countries and governments build data centers using its graphics processing units to unlock the potential of AI for local economies and populations. As part of that effort, Huang recently carried out a similar whirlwind trip to the Middle East, where Nvidia is planning to sell its latest chips as part of big data center buildouts in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

""Every industrial revolution begins with infrastructure. AI is the essential infrastructure of our time, just as electricity and the internet once were,"" Huang said in a Wednesday press release.

""Europe has now awakened to the importance of these AI factories, the importance of this AI infrastructure,"" Huang said during a separate presentation on Wednesday. AI factories is the term Nvidia uses for massive data centers containing its GPUs.

Huang added that AI computing capacity in Europe will grow by a factor of 10 in the next two years.

The tech giant seeks to expand its international footprint and embed itself in national level AI infrastructure. That push into new markets is even more critical as U.S. export restrictions on Nvidia's most advanced chips have lost the company revenue in China.

Nvidia said it is working with country governments, regional cloud and telecommunications firms and technology centers in Europe.

One of the key partnerships announced is between Nvidia and French startup Mistral, which will build an ""AI cloud"" that will deploy 18,000 Nvidia Grace Blackwell chips. This will allow businesses to develop and use AI through Mistral's models, Nvidia said.

Nvidia also announced infrastructure projects in Italy and Armenia.

Orange and Telefonica are among the telecommunications companies also working with Nvidia in areas such as deploying AI applications and large language models as part of the newly announced deals.

In Germany, Nvidia said it is building what it has dubbed as an ""industrial cloud"" that will feature 10,000 GPUs and will be specifically designed to provide services for European manufacturers.

The big focus from Nvidia in Europe is around so-called ""sovereign AI,"" the idea that data centers and servers that are providing services to users in the European Union, are actually located regionally rather than abroad.

Nvidia also announced so-called ""tech centers"" in Europe, which will focus on advanced research, upskilling workforces and accelerating scientific breakthroughs in countries including the U.K., France, Spain and Germany.

Nvidia also expanded a product called DGX Cloud Lepton — something of a marketplace for GPUs — with new cloud providers and integrated it with AI model repository Hugging Face. DGX Cloud Lepton works by allowing developers to access GPUs across the world to run AI applications.

While Nvidia is best-known for its hardware — its infamous GPUs — the technology giant has ramped up its focus on its software offering to help keep the company at the center of fast-moving AI development.

That software push has continued into Europe.

Last year, Nvidia announced a product called Nvidia NIM, which is effectively a pre-packaged AI model that can be quickly deployed and that lets developers build apps on it. Nvidia on Wednesday announced any large language model available on Hugging Face can also be deployed as NIM.

Rather than creating their own models, developers can easily access these options via Nvidia's NIM service.

Nvidia's strategy is to link its hardware to all of this software, giving it an edge over rivals in a bid to cement its dominance so far in AI.

Tech billionaire Elon Musk on Wednesday said he regretted some of the social media posts he made about U.S. President Donald Trump last week during an explosive public dispute with his former close ally.

""I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far,"" Musk said on the X social media platform.

The feud dissolved a tight partnership that had propelled Musk to spearhead the budget-slashing Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, under Trump's second administration, fueling market concerns over the outlook for the tech tycoon's Tesla and SpaceX businesses. Immediately after the row, the electric vehicle automaker saw its biggest ever hit, with shares since recouping losses.

Last week's conflict was sparked by Musk's opposition to the Trump-backed ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" tax and spending bill. In a CBS interview, Musk said the package ""undermines"" the work of DOGE, further blasting it on social media by saying it would substantially increase the U.S. budget deficit. The Trump administration has disputed this point.

Over the weekend, Trump said there would be consequences for Musk if he supported Democratic candidates challenging the tax and spending bill. At the time, the president noted that he had no plans for speaking with Musk — before changing tack on Monday to indicate he would not have a problem if Musk called.

The row, carried out simultaneously over the X and Truth Social media platforms owned by Musk and Trump, respectively, posed immediate threats to the tech billionaire's ventures.

Critically, the U.S. president suggested terminating government contracts and subsidies awarded to Musk's companies. Musk meanwhile threatened to decommission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft — which is currently the only U.S. choice for bringing crew to and from the International Space Station — before quickly walking back his statement.

The storm showed signs of settling by the weekend. As of Saturday, Musk appeared to have deleted some of his social media posts that had contributed to the ramped-up conflict with the White House leader, including an update in which he had accused Trump of being mentioned in the ""files"" of late sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein. The White House had disputed the allegation.

A post in which Musk replied ""yes"" to a social media user calling for Trump to be impeached and replaced with Vice President JD Vance also appeared to have been deleted.

In turn, Trump on Monday said he was planning to retain the Starlink technology, a satellite internet service that is part of Musk's SpaceX, at the White House.

German start-up Proxima Fusion on Wednesday announced it had raised 130 million euros ($148 million) in a record funding round, with investors hopeful the company can soon develop the world's first commercial nuclear fusion power plant.

The Series A financing round, which was co-led by investors Cherry Ventures and Balderton Capital, represents the largest private fusion investment round in Europe to date.

The buzz around nuclear fusion has kicked into overdrive in recent years. Advocates say the technology, which is the process that powers the sun and stars, can play a pivotal role in the energy transition.

Fusion energy is the process of jamming together two hydrogen atoms to form one helium atom, which releases massive amounts of power. Scientists and engineers have been scrambling to recreate and harness nuclear fusion since the theory was first understood in the 1930s.

""The single thing maybe that is worth highlighting is the speed at which this is happening,"" Proxima Fusion CEO and co-founder Francesco Sciortino told CNBC by video call.

""It is a bit uncommon in the domain of deep tech and especially in Europe, of course, but $150 million gives us the financing that we need for everything that we have ahead of us in the next few years,"" he added.

Proxima Fusion's chief executive described nuclear fusion as the ""ultimate"" source of clean energy and something that is ""inevitable"" for humanity.

""The question is not whether fusion is possible but whether we manage to harness it on Earth in a way that lends itself to commercial efforts,"" Sciortino said.

If nuclear fusion can be replicated at an industrial scale, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says the technology could provide virtually limitless clean, safe and affordable energy that meets the world's demand.

Not everyone is convinced, however. Researchers have suggested the technology is likely still a long way off from being ready to be scaled up for commercial use.

The Series A financing round brings Proxima Fusion's total funding to more than 185 million euros in private and public capital, accelerating the Munich-based firm's mission of building the first stellarator-based fusion power plant in the 2030s.

An alternative to the more common tokamak, a stellarator is a device that uses magnetic fields to confine plasma in the shape of a donut, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. These magnetic fields allow scientists to control the plasma particles and allow the right conditions for nuclear fusion.

""Stellarators aren't just the most technologically viable approach to fusion energy—they're the power plants of the future, capable of leading Europe into a new era of clean energy,"" Daniel Waterhouse, partner at Balderton Capital, said in a statement.

Proxima Fusion was founded two years ago as a spin out from the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP).

Nintendo sold more than 3.5 million units of its flagship Switch 2 gaming system in the four days following its launch, with online stores of major U.S. retailers putting up ""out of stock"" signs. 

The record-breaking start for the company's first new console in eight years, puts Nintendo on the path to realizing its aim of selling 15 million units of the Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026. 

However, analysts continue to believe that those expectations are modest, and forecast the strong initial demand to sustain.

""The market expected a record from Nintendo, and as it turns out, Nintendo delivered,"" Serkan Toto, CEO and founder of gaming industry consultancy Kantan Games, told CNBC.

""All signals prior to launch pointed to significant demand, and I believe we will see further records broken over the next weeks or months,"" he added.

Toto has maintains that the Switch 2 will sell over 20 million units in its first 12 months. David Gibson, senior research analyst at MST Financial told CNBC that he expects 20 million sales for the year ending March 2026.

The Switch 2, which was released on June 5, has been met with much fanfare, with people lining up for hours ahead of midnight releases at Nintendo stores.

""Fans around the world are showing their enthusiasm for Nintendo Switch 2 as an upgraded way to play at home and on the go,"" Nintendo of America President and Chief Operating Officer Doug Bowser said in a statement, adding the company was thankful for the response. 

Tokyo-listed shares of Nintendo, which have gained nearly 30% so far this year, were down 3.5% on Wednesday, LSEG data showed. The company has seen its shares rise nearly fivefold since the original Switch debuted in early March 2017.

It remains to be seen if the Switch 2 can recapture the magic of its predecessor, which had set the bar with 15 million unit sales in its first year. It went on to sell more than 152 million units to become the second-highest selling Nintendo device ever, behind the Nintendo DS.

The record initial sales of the Switch are in line with the strong demand analysts had predicted. However, the rush has put into question Nintendo's ability to meet demand. 

Retailers including Walmart, GameStop, Target and Best Buy were out of stock of the consoles, their online stores showed Wednesday. 

In April, Nintendo's Bowser told CNBC that the company had been working with ""retail partners to ensure there's ample supply for not only the launch weekend, but well beyond.""

However, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa stated the same month that 2.2 million people in Japan had entered the lottery to purchase the Switch 2 on launch day, exceeding expectations and what the company had initially planned to deliver to stores.

Kantan Games' Toto said shortages in Japan were expected to persist, but would be less impactful elsewhere.

""Except for Japan where demand for Switch 2 is extraordinarily high, it looks like fans who really want the console and invest time in trying to secure one actually can get one,"" he said. ""It might take a while, but as far as can be monitored, supply seems to be more robust than around the launch of the original Switch in 2017.""

President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal tariffs"" on most countries around the world also present headwinds for the Switch 2. 

In April, the company announced that it would delay preorders of the Switch 2 in the U.S. while it considers the impact of tariffs.

The Switch 2 retails for $449 in the U.S., which makes it Nintendo's priciest console to date.

Nintendo's Bowser said in April the company was going to ""monitor where tariffs are going"" before making any further decisions on price hikes. 

MST Financial's Gibson said that a resolution to Trump's tariffs and lower duty rates could see the Switch 2 prices drop in the U.S.

The Switch 2 builds on the success of the original Switch, featuring a larger screen and improved performance. The system also introduces the new GameChat2 feature, which allows players to voice or video chat with friends online and share game screens.

There was good news on the U.S. inflation front in May as both the headline and core rates of the Consumer Price Index rose less than forecast.

The CPI rose 0.1% in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economist forecasts had been for 0.2% and April's pace was 0.2%.

On a year-over-year basis, the CPI climbed 2.4% against estimates for 2.5% and April's 2.3%

Core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy categories, rose 0.1% last month versus forecasts for 0.3% and 0.2% in April. Year-over-year core CPI was 2.8% versus an expected 2.9% and 2.8% in April.

Bitcoin BTC$109,688.15 rose about 0.6% in the moments following the news, trading at $109,800, up 0.3% over the past 24 hours.

Despite continued uncertainty around inflation's trajectory, the market remains confident that the Federal Reserve will begin easing policy later this year. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, traders are fully pricing in two rate cuts, with the first expected in September and the second in December. For the moment, this morning's fresh data hasn't changed that calculus.

A check of traditional markets finds U.S. stock index futures reversing earlier declines and now in the green by about 0.4% across the board. The 10-year Treasury yield is lower by five basis points to 4.45%.

Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones says bitcoin isn't just a speculative asset — it's a necessity in the current economic environment.



In a Bloomberg TV interview, Jones argued that the U.S. is stuck in a “debt trap” and that policymakers will likely keep real interest rates below inflation to reduce the burden. 

President Trump, Jones said, is will likely appoint an ""uber-dovish"" Fed chair to replace Jerome Powell, whose term atop the U.S. central bank ends next year. That means higher prices, lower purchasing power and greater risk for traditional portfolios, Jones continued. To hedge against that scenario, Tudor Jones believes every portfolio should consist of bitcoin BTC$109,688.15, gold, and stocks.



“It would be some combination of vol-adjusted bitcoin, gold, and stocks,” Jones said, noting that bitcoin's price swings are much steeper than those of gold, so position sizes should vary. Still, he was clear: “That's probably your best portfolio to fight inflation.""



Jones, who runs the $16 billion macro hedge fund Tudor Investment Corp., has long been vocal about using bitcoin as an inflation hedge. While he previously suggested allocating 1–2%, this time he declined to give a number — though he reiterated his strong conviction.



His remarks came after fresh Consumer Price Index data Wednesday morning showed inflation rising 2.4% over the past year — slightly below forecasts.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Currency must be separated from state: Returning to Bitcoin's original vision","https://cointelegraph.com/news/currency-must-be-separated-from-state-returning-to-bitcoin-s-original-vision","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 15:02:07 GMT","

 As government overreach and institutional interests reshape the blockchain landscape, it's time to return to Bitcoin's founding vision: a truly decentralized, immutable currency free from state and corporate control. 

Opinion by: Dr. K, co-founder of Quai Network

While Bitcoin was intended to enable people to opt out of state-centralized money systems, the blockchain industry has since lost its way. Today, we see the threat of government overreach along with blockchain solutions that prioritize scalability and performance over decentralization. 

The rise of networks like Ethereum and Solana has certainly been captivating, but these blockchains comprise core values in exchange for usability and institutions' adoption. To achieve the mission that Satoshi started, there is a dire need to return to Bitcoin's original ethos of money, which is credibly neutral, immutable money that cannot be manipulated.

With a fixed supply of 21 million coins and regular halving events, Bitcoin exudes monetary certainty. No central authority or discovery can change Bitcoin's supply. This positions Bitcoin as an incredibly predictable store of value against the backdrop of money printing and rampant inflation, setting it apart from other forms of currency. Additionally, Bitcoin's rules are extremely difficult to change, which builds long-term trust in the network.

Key layer-1 (L1) players such as Ethereum and Solana offer unmatched flexibility and performance, but with an alarming trade-off. Ethereum's governance-led updates that affect gas fees and staking rewards don't always please those with ETH holdings. Moreover, Solana prioritizes speed and performance above all else, which leaves it vulnerable to increased levels of centralization. As a result of trade-offs, L1 networks like Ethereum and Solana are severely weakened in the face of censorship and manipulation, whether from governments, regulators, or powerful corporate interests.

As of March 2024, Coinbase controlled 3.84 million ETH staked on 120,000 validators, representing 11.42% of the total staked Ether, and is the largest solo Ethereum node operator. This concentration poses centralization issues, as a handful of large players, like Coinbase, could threaten Ethereum's decentralization and trigger regulatory risks. Additionally, it takes control away from the individual and places it back into the hands of a large, centralized corporation — the complete opposite of the original vision for cryptocurrency.

The crypto industry began as a rebellion against Big Tech and the gatekeeping of Silicon Valley, where only accredited investors could back startups and benefit from early-stage gains. Crypto flipped that paradigm on its head. For the first time, ordinary people, not VCs or insiders, could participate in creating new technologies from Day One. But now that the industry has had some time to mature, venture capital has reasserted itself, dispensing crypto in ways that appeal to the very systems it was trying to disrupt.

Recent: Metaplanet's Bitcoin ‘premium' nears $600K per BTC

While venture capital hastens innovation, it also centralizes control through token distributions, board seats and control over product roadmaps. Solana is among the leading blockchains to have received lots of investment from firms such as a16z and Polychain Capital. This investment fuelled rapid growth but also created a centralization of tokens and decision-making powers among a handful of investors.

The most prominent crypto projects, like Ethereum and Solana — whether cynical of the old system or not — are ultimately built to serve institutions in their current state. Founding teams lock up large pre-mines, give favorably tilted terms to early investors, and structure incentives toward eventual exits rather than long-term decentralization. These behaviors reintroduce many similar power dynamics that Bitcoin sought to eliminate.

Decentralization is the essence of censorship resistance as well as individual economic liberty. Bitcoin's resistance to alteration protects it from being hijacked by powerful interests. Networks that see decentralization as a trade-off risk falling under the control of a new gatekeeper class. To preserve the promise of crypto, decentralization must remain the highest priority.

The strength of Bitcoin is in its neutrality and immutability, not its programmability or speed.

The crypto ecosystem needs to get back to these values to avoid repeating the mistakes of the traditional financial system. Rather than trends or institutional approval, the industry must recommit to developing instruments for absolute financial independence. Returning to Bitcoin's original vision is the only way to separate currency from the state and reclaim control over money through a trustless, censorship-resistant system.

As EY Global Blockchain Leader, Paul Brody is responsible for driving initiatives and investments in blockchain technology across consulting, audit, and tax business lines, including the build-out of the first EY global SaaS platform, Blockchain.EY.com. With Brody at the helm, EY was the first and only professional services firm to commit to public blockchains and Ethereum.

The views expressed here are his own and do not necessarily represent those of Decrypt.

Have you heard? Ethereum is dead. Or no…wait, it is pivoting. The price isn't high enough. Other chains are gaining traction. Something must be done. 

Ethereum is not dead. It is not pivoting. It's doing just fine. 

The constant chatter about Ethereum online seems to fulfill a need for drama that the network itself has failed to provide. Ethereum has been the world's leading and largest programmable blockchain since its inception. As Ethereum approaches its 10th birthday, it remains the preferred destination for digital asset investors, banks, and start-ups in the crypto ecosystem.

Perhaps the biggest source of friction in the ecosystem comes from the gap between those who see Ethereum as a computing platform—the foundation for the future of digital finance—and those who would like it to be the ideal digital asset and store of value, similar, if not better than Bitcoin.  For the latter group, Ethereum's low asset price relative to Bitcoin is a perpetual source of disappointment.

For people who see Ethereum primarily as a computing platform, the low asset price is secondary to the network's enormously successful transformation over the last few years. In their view, and my own, Ethereum has gone from strength to strength.

Turn back the clock five years and things looked different. Ethereum was closer to a wildly successful proof of concept than the future of finance.

The network struggled to execute more than a million transactions a day, and when it became congested, transaction fees reached absurd levels, as much as $50 for a single payment or transfer. And every transaction came with a sizable carbon footprint, thanks to the proof-of-work transaction processing system.

Today, the proof-of-work system is gone. In its place, proof of stake handles the same workload with a carbon footprint 99% lower.

Ethereum's capacity crunch is also a distant memory. Today, the network can handle up to 250-450 million transactions per year, according to recent estimates. Over 100 companies have built expansions on top of Ethereum (known as Layer 2 networks). The enormous mismatch between available capacity and actual typical demand has led to a collapse in transaction fees. Fees on these expansion networks are reliably between $0.01 and $0.10, per data on l2fees.info. 

Lower transaction fees mean lower “dividends” to network stakeholders. Ethereum's proof of stake system and Layer-2 scaling were so successful that plunging fees have effectively reduced the “yield” on staking, reducing the value of Ethereum in the views of some investors, especially those that see Ethereum as just a variation on Bitcoin. 

But Ethereum is not Bitcoin. Ethereum's remarkable success has always come from its strength as a platform on which to build. Platforms gather strength over time, fueled by developer communities and the continuous introduction of new capabilities. 

This is where Ethereum really shines. The network has operated for nearly a decade without downtime, executing major network upgrades every six to eight months. No other blockchain ecosystem comes close in terms of reliability.

The Ethereum Foundation (EF), the organization that stewards the development roadmap, has invested strategically in critical technologies and, very importantly, in resilience. 

Nearly every major component of the network infrastructure has multiple unique providers, many of them funded by grants from the EF. This means no single point of failure. More than a million people stake Ethereum, per data on Beaconcha.in, and there are more than 10,000 active network nodes. The latest Ethereum roadmap, unveiled in November, is a multi-year path to another order-of-magnitude increase in capacity and performance.

None of this is terribly interesting if you want to make a quick buck selling a meme coin right now. But it is all critically important to banks, corporations, and governments thinking about rebuilding the future of their financial infrastructure. This second group of builders moves more slowly but with far greater long-term value. It's no surprise that more than 85% of the “real world” digital assets and more than 50% of stablecoin value are on Ethereum.

The asset price of Ethereum may yet recover as rising demand offsets low transaction prices. The pricing pattern of Ethereum now is going to be different.

It's not digital gold, swinging up and down based on geopolitics. It's the next network computing platform, driven by sustained growth in transaction volumes. If you adjust your viewpoint, the path upward and onwards becomes a lot more clearly visible.

Decentralized Layer 1 blockchain XRP Ledger's (XRPL) sidechain that's compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is set to go live in the second quarter, Jaazi Cooper, director of product management at Ripple, and David Schwartz, Ripple's chief technology officer said at the ongoing APEX 2025 conference in Singapore.

EVM compatibility refers to the ability of the blockchain to run Ethereum-based decentralized applications and smart contracts seamlessly.

The XRPL EVM sidechain testnet went live early this year and is experiencing rapid growth, according to Peersyst Technologies.

""87 new entities – with no prior XRP involvement – are now contributing to the ecosystem: infrastructure, apps, and demand generation,"" Peersyst said on X. ""When mainnet goes live, all of it becomes part of the XRP ecosystem – possibly the biggest onboarding in XRP history.""

The EVM sidechain will allow users to potentially generate yield through DeFi applications, such as liquidity pools, and smart contract interactions.

After years of testing, the XRP Ledger will finally launch its Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible sidechain in the second quarter of 2025.

Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz confirmed the timeline at the Apex 2025 event, a move that integrates Ethereum's smart contract capabilities into the XRPL ecosystem.

The development aims to expand XRP's utility beyond its traditional payment role by addressing alleged limitations in DeFi's programmability.

Developed in a joint effort by Ripple and Peersyst Technology, the sidechain provides full EVM compatibility, allowing developers to deploy applications using established Ethereum tools like Solidity, MetaMask, and Truffle. Transactions on the network will utilize wrapped XRP (wXRP) as the native gas token.

The Axelar network will function as the exclusive bridge for transferring assets, including the XRP required to create wXRP, between the XRPL mainnet and the new EVM sidechain. The architecture connects XRPL to the more than 69 other blockchain ecosystems supported by Axelar.

The sidechain operates on a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, selected for performance and efficiency. Its targeted metrics are over 1,000 transactions per second and transaction costs below $0.01.

To ensure network integrity, the sidechain's code underwent a security audit by Informal Systems in February 2025. The audit identified and led to the resolution of one critical issue related to a Cosmos SDK module, with other findings being of low risk.

This initiative represents a strategic effort to attract developers from the larger EVM ecosystem and provide new avenues for applications on the XRP Ledger. By lowering the barrier to entry, the sidechain may foster a more diverse application environment for XRPL's user base, which holds over six million wallets.

The use of wXRP for transaction fees introduces a new demand mechanism for the XRP token, tying its utility directly to the activity level on the EVM sidechain. This could extend its tokenomics beyond its primary function in facilitating cross-border settlements.

Activity on the sidechain's testnet suggests initial developer interest. According to a post from Peersyst, projects including Strobe Finance, Vertex Protocol, and Secured Labs are already building applications.

The firm also reported that 87 new entities with no prior involvement in the XRP ecosystem are now contributing on the testnet, suggesting the potential for broad ecosystem growth upon the mainnet's release.

The project's structure as a sidechain allows these new capabilities to be introduced without altering the XRPL mainnet's core protocol, which remains optimized for payments. The mainnet launch of the XRPL EVM Sidechain is scheduled to proceed in the second quarter of 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","As Trump Sons Hoard Bitcoin Snap Up These Altcoins Instead","https://bitcoinist.com/as-trump-sons-hoard-bitcoin-snap-up-these-altcoins/","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 10:39:01 GMT","

You don't get to be one of the richest and most powerful men in the world by giving up good opportunities. That's a lesson Trump seems to have taught his sons well – they're currently out buying Bitcoin, and have amassed a stockpile of $23.7M in $BTC.

But is that the smartest play in crypto right now?

Even Strategy's much-vaunted plan to add to its ever-growing 528K Bitcoin stockpile is risky, with experts warning that it might actually decrease demand for Bitcoin from central banks.

While the Trumps are buying BTC, you should snap up these altcoins for some major gains flying under the Bitcoin radar.

When Donald Trump said he'd be the first Crypto President, no one knew what he meant.



Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump are both spearheading a new Bitcoin treasury corporation. The simply-named American Bitcoin is a crypto mining company planning to gather as much Bitcoin as possible. In the words of its SEC filing:

ABTC considers its Bitcoin holdings to be long-term in nature and expects to continue accumulating Bitcoin. ABTC has not set any specific target for the amount of Bitcoin it seeks to hold… Bitcoin accumulation is not a side effect of ABTC's business. It is the business.

—American Bitcoin SEC filing, American Bitcoin

The company's off to a small start, with only 215 bought $BTC so far, but intends to add to that portfolio aggressively.

And whether intentional or not, ABTC is actually proving a larger narrative, one that Swiss crypto bank Sygnum says is crucial for the continued health of the crypto economy.

Sygnum discussed the impact of large-scale Bitcoin treasuries like Strategy and highlightedt hat Strategy currently owns roughly 3% of all the Bitcoin that will ever be made.

The company also said that ‘large, concentrated holdings are a risk for any asset,' with Strategy's stockpile ‘approaching a point where they become problematic.'

Why? Partly because of normal market economics and sentiment. Decreased liquid supply, caused by companies holding $BTC in large treasuries, can increase volatility.

There's also the psychological impact on the market; if Strategy should ever sell any of their $BTC, the headline ‘Strategy Sells Bitcoin' might be enough to send the price plummeting.

Just as the opposite headline is causing bull rushes in the market nowadays

So what's an honest investor to do? In this case, don't follow the Trumps. Instead, take a look at these best altcoins to buy in a market that's still indecisive about Bitcoin's impact.

Solaxy ($SOLX) solves Solana's lingering problems. Yes, Solana is fast, and yes, it's cheap (when compared to Ethereum's notorious gas fees). But it's also prone to congestion and the occasional failed transaction, and simply can't keep up with Ethereum's scalability.

Enter Solaxy, the first-ever Solana Layer-2 solution. It brings faster transaction speeds, zero execution failures, and a multichain architecture and token. $SOLX will launch on Ethereum and be bridgeable to Solaxy when the Layer-2 fully deploys.



Solaxy forms the next evolution of the always-expanding Solana ecosystem. It will combine Ethereum's strength and reliability with Solana's speed, providing an unparalleled advantage for new crypto projects and meme coin launches.

With only 5 days left in the ongoing presale, check out our price prediction to see why we think the $SOLX price could rise from its current $0.001752 to $0.032 by the end of 2025, increasing by 1,700%.

Learn how to buy $SOLX, and don't miss out on a presale that has already raised $47M.

XRP has notched a number of wins recently, including:

It all helps to explain why the number of transactions on XRP experienced a recent spike.



$XRP is up 14% year-to-date, with possibilities of a spot ETF lingering on the horizon, a move that boosted demand for $BTC and $ETH last year.

XRP is one of the original mainstays of the crypto ecosystem, launched way back in 2012. It's become a frequently-used tool for cross-border payments. Check out XRP's whitepaper and technical details to learn more about the world's fourth-largest crypto.

The best meme coins often start small – even underground, on platforms Telegram. Opportunities abound, but so do risks like honeypots (scam tokens that can't be sold) and rug pulls (malicious tokens). Trading is fast-paced, and opportunities come and go quickly.

Enter the Snorter Bot and the Snorter Token ($SNORT). Honeypot and rugpull detection avoid dangers, while the bot can execute fast, secure swaps and automatic sniping thanks to the $SNORT token.

Traders can even set limit orders and copy other successful traders with the bot. It's an entire arsenal of advanced trading tools in a tool that has a distinct meme coin flair.



During the presale, $SNORT can be staked for 468% dynamic APY, providing long-term yield over the next year.

With its presale raising over $686K and the token price set at $0.0949, the project is looking very promising. As if it could snort every bit of profit for you.

Read more on how to buy Snorter Token, and visit the Snorter Token presale page to get them while they're hot and cheap.

While the Trumps double down on Bitcoin, savvy investors may want to look elsewhere while the debates are firing back and forth.

With Solaxy solving Solana's scalability, XRP expanding to the EVM, and Snorter Token offering real utility in meme coin trading, these top meme coins could offer great upside and less systemic risk.

Certainly less so than blindly following the lesser scions of the Trump empire.

As always, do your own research. This isn't financial advice.

The Hyperliquid platform's native token, HYPE, is today the strongest performer among top 15 assets by market cap—excluding stablecoins. Its seven-day gains have outpaced major altcoins as Bitcoin volatility posts record lows for the year, pushing a relatively stable trading pattern.

HYPE traded at $41.31, down 0.3% on the day, yet maintaining strong momentum with 12.4% weekly gains and 67.2% monthly appreciation, according to data from CoinGecko. It has sustained this uptrend since mid-May, with recent price action pushing HYPE back toward monthly highs around the $42 range.

Compared to established altcoins, heightened investor interest around HYPE ""reflects both speculative momentum and deeper fundamentals like ecosystem growth and institutional interest,"" Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at crypto and quantitative trading firm Kronos Research, told Decrypt.

For instance, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin posted modest gains, extending their upward momentum as the broader crypto market remains relatively stable.

Over the week, ETH has climbed 7%, SOL by 7.3%, and DOGE by 4.4% over the same stretch. All three are showing signs of recovery from late-May lows, but remain well below recent local highs.

Bitcoin, meanwhile, posted record lows for implied volatility, which gauges how much of its spot price could move further, based on options prices.

Of the four, Liu suggests ""a mix of retail hype in DOGE and HYPE, alongside real progress in ETH and SOL"" is taking shape.

But while the upswing ""has legs short‑term, driven by liquidity, retail energy, and fresh institutional interest,"" Liu acknowledged how broader macro factors are still at play, citing how ""tariff headlines and dollar strength"" ratios add friction to the fray.

""Long‑term upside hinges on macro stability and clear regulation,"" Liu told Decrypt.

The same factors could be drawn on Bitcoin, whose new highs have been “fueled by increasingly hard-to-ignore institutional participation,” and as such has “reignited optimism across the entire crypto space,” encouraging “renewed retail interest and appetite for altcoins perceived as strong projects or community favorites,” Jeth Ang, chief operating officer at modular onchain platform Sovrun, told Decrypt.

""This institutional momentum creates a positive feedback loop, encouraging renewed retail interest and appetite for altcoins perceived as strong projects or community favorites,"" he added, saying that one of the things helping HYPE is its simple yet effective token design.

""This clarity, combined with growing regulatory optimism, strengthens the case not only for $HYPE but also for crypto's evolving role as a credible, revenue-generating asset class,"" Ang said.

Interest in Hyperliquid has resulted in ""consistently high organic usage"" as it competes with ""centralized derivative exchanges like Binance and Bybit,"" analysts at investment firm Grayscale wrote last week, citing how the decentralized exchange has attracted users for its perpetual futures offerings, as fiscal risks generated broader demand for Bitcoin and other cryptos.

In crypto, perpetual futures are derivatives contracts that never expire, allowing traders to speculate on price movements indefinitely without taking delivery of the underlying asset.

The idea was first proposed in 1992 by American economist and Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller. It later gained traction and now accounts for roughly 93% of all derivatives trading in crypto, according to industry estimates.

Last month, Hyperliquid joined a group of other top exchanges responding to the SEC's call on perpetuals, citing how ""continuous, on-chain markets"" such as its platform ""already meet—and in several respects exceed"" what the regulator requires ""for resilience and customer protection.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Correction in One Surging Asset Could Trigger Rallies for Altcoin Markets, According to Analyst Michaël van de Poppe","https://dailyhodl.com/2025/06/10/correction-in-one-surging-asset-could-trigger-rallies-for-altcoin-markets-according-to-analyst-michael-van-de-poppe/","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 00:01:19 GMT","

A widely followed crypto strategist thinks that a correction in one safe-haven asset will likely trigger risk-on behavior that could benefit altcoins.

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe tells his 791,800 followers on the social media platform X that he's keeping a close watch on gold's price action, noting that the precious metal's chart is the “most important chart to watch” this week.

According to the trader, gold appears to have printed a bearish lower high setup on the six-hour chart, suggesting that the precious metal could fall to as low as $3,200 in the near term.

“As long as Gold stays sub-$3,365, we're likely going to see a sharp fall in the coming one to two weeks of anything between 4-10%, resulting into a sudden macroeconomic shift.” 

Van de Poppe believes that falling gold prices will be beneficial for altcoins, as it suggests an increased appetite for risk among investors.

“At the end of [last] week, a sudden [gold] correction took place, which might result in the confirmation of a short-term downtrend.

This is vital, as that would attract more investors towards Altcoins.

Why?

It would enable more investors to be jumping into risk-on assets, when gold implies that it continues to fall.

This means –> money/liquidity flows from risk-off assets towards risk-on assets, and the best asset class remains to be crypto.” 

But the trader warns that altcoins will likely see lower levels if gold shatters $3,365.

“If it does break above that crucial level, the theory is invalidated, and we're likely open for printing new highs, which then means that we're printing new lows on altcoins.

For me, this is crucial, as a correction in Gold and rally in the CNH (offshore Chinese renminbi) implies that we're going to be seeing more interest flowing into crypto after that.”

At time of writing, gold is trading for $3,324, up more than 60% in the last 18 months.

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has taken centre stage across various industries. From AI-generated art to chatbots in customer service, every sector is seemingly poised for disruption.

It's not just in your news feed every day – venture capital is pouring in, while CEOs are eager to declare their companies “AI-first”. But for those who remember the lofty promises of other technologies that have since faded from memory, there's an uncanny sense of déjà vu.

In 2017, it was blockchain that promised to transform every industry. Companies added “blockchain” to their name and watched stock prices skyrocket, regardless of whether the technology was actually used, or how.

Now, a similar trend is emerging with AI. What's unfolding is not just a wave of innovation, but a textbook example of a tech hype cycle. We've been here many times before.

The tech hype cycle, first defined by the research firm Gartner, describes how emerging technologies rise on a wave of inflated promises and expectations, crash into disillusionment and, eventually, find a more realistic and useful application. 

Recognising the signs of this cycle is crucial. It helps in distinguishing between genuine technological shifts and passing fads driven by speculative investment and good marketing.

It can also mean the difference between making a good business decision and a very costly mistake. Meta, for example, invested more than US$40 billion into the metaverse idea while seemingly chasing their own manufactured tech hype, only to abandon it later.

      Why the metaverse isn't ready to be the future of work just yet




In 2017, blockchain was everyone's focus. Presented as a revolutionary technology, blockchain offered a decentralised way to record and verify transactions, unlike traditional systems that rely on central authorities or databases.

US soft drinks company Long Island Iced Tea Corporation became Long Blockchain Corporation and saw its stock rise 400% overnight, despite having no blockchain product. Kodak launched a vague cryptocurrency called KodakCoin, sending its stock price soaring.

These developments were less about innovation and more about speculation, chasing short-term gains driven by hype. Most blockchain projects never delivered real value. Companies rushed in, driven by fear of missing out and the promise of technological transformation.

But the tech wasn't ready, and the solutions it supposedly offered were often misaligned with real industry problems. Companies tried everything, from tracking pet food ingredients on blockchain, to launching loyalty programs with crypto tokens, often without clear benefits or better alternatives. 

In the end, about 90% of enterprise blockchain solutions failed by mid-2019.

Fast-forward to 2023, and the same pattern started playing out with AI. Digital media company BuzzFeed saw its stock jump more than 100% after announcing it would use AI to generate quizzes and content. Financial services company Klarna replaced 700 workers with an AI chatbot, claiming it could handle millions of customer queries.

The results were mostly negative. Klarna soon saw a decline in customer satisfaction and had to walk back its strategy, rehiring humans for customer support this year. BuzzFeed's AI content push failed to save its struggling business, and its news division later shut down. Tech media company CNET published AI-generated articles riddled with errors, damaging its credibility. 

These are not isolated incidents. They're signals that AI, like blockchain, was being over hyped.

There are three main forces at play: inflated expectations, short-term view and flawed implementation. Tech companies, under pressure from investors and media narratives, overpromise what AI can do.

Leaders pitch vague and utopian concepts of “transformation” without the infrastructure or planning to back them up. And many rush to implement, riding the hype wave. 

They are often hindered by a short-term view of what alignment with the new tech hype can do for their company, ignoring the potential downsides. They roll out untested systems, underestimate complexity or even the necessity, and hope that novelty alone will drive the return on investment.

The result is often disappointment – not because the technology lacks potential, but because it's applied too broadly, too soon, and with too little planning and oversight.

Like blockchain, AI is a legitimate technological innovation with real, transformative potential.

Often, these technologies simply need time to find the right application. While the initial blockchain hype has faded, the technology has found a practical niche in areas like “asset tokenization” within financial markets. This allows assets like real estate or company shares to be represented by digital tokens on the blockchain, enabling easier, faster and cheaper trading.

The same pattern can be expected with generative AI. The current AI hype cycle appears to be tapering off, and the consequences of rushed or poorly thought-out implementations will likely become more visible in the coming years. 

However, this decline in hype doesn't signal the end of generative AI's relevance. Rather, it marks the beginning of a more grounded phase where the technology can find the most suitable applications. 

One of the clearest takeaways so far is that AI should be used to enhance human productivity, not replace it. From people pushing back against the use of AI to replace them, to AI making frequent and costly mistakes, human oversight paired with AI-enhanced productivity is increasingly seen as the most likely path forward. 

Recognising the patterns of tech hype is essential for making smarter decisions. Instead of rushing to adopt every new innovation based on inflated promises, a measured, problem-driven approach leads to more meaningful outcomes.

Long-term success comes from thoughtful experimentation, implementation, and clear purpose, not from chasing trends or short-term gains. Hype should never dictate strategy; real value lies in solving real problems.

Pudgy Penguins are getting their metaverse on again.

Not satisfied with staying confined to their own Pudgy World metaverse, Pudgy Penguins are expanding into a new virtual world, according to a press release shared with The Defiant. The beloved NFT brand is integrating with My Neighbor Alice, a web3 multiplayer game, as part of a broader partnership.

A core part of the partnership is a special zone in the game built for Pudgy Penguin NFT collection holders. My Neighbor Alice will feature a special Pudgy Land region in its new Snowflake Wilds, “a frosty, feel-good winter wonderland” area of the game.

While Snowflake Wilds are open to everyone, Pudgy Land is exclusively for owners of Pudgy Penguin NFTs, including Lil Pudgys and Pudgy Rod collection holders. Pudgy Land is a part of the game “where the community can hang out, quest, craft, and connect,” according to the press release.

Holders of Pudgy Penguins and Lil Pudgys will enter the game with their NFT as an egg that hatches to become their specific NFT. Holders of Pudgy Rods, which are fishing rods created to accompany each Pudgy Penguin NFT, will be able to equip them with custom fishing rod skins and use them to catch special fish.

“With this partnership we're pushing the envelope when it comes to interoperability,” said Steve Haßenpflug, vice president of games at ChromaWay and My Neighbor Alice in a statement, continuing:

My Neighbor Alice is built on the Chromia blockchain, where players can own, trade and sell virtual asset NFTs. Pudgy Penguins NFT collections are based on Ethereum.

The Pudgy Penguin brand's own Pudgy World metaverse, built on ZKSync, is currently in closed beta but promises to launch “soon.”

December's launch of the project's Solana-based PENGU token via airdrop was controversial, and characterized by high volatility for both the token and the NFT collection, with Pudgy Penguins' floor price spiking as high as 25 ETH as the launch approached. It is currently 9.24 ETH, according to NFTPriceFloor.

Last month, Pudgy Penguins waddled over to the TON blockchain, allowing 1 billion-plus Telegram users to play Pengu Clash, a multiplayer skill game with mini-games like darts, football and bomber with token-based incentives, tournament rules, unlockable gear, accessories and team cosmetics, according to Pudgy Penguins. It is “pay-to-win” free, the company said in a release.

Also in May, Pudgy Penguins revealed that it was expanding its off-chain activities beyond physical plushies to publishing a children's book with Random House titled “The Worst Birthday Present Ever.”

NFT prices have dropped dramatically since the airdrop high, which lasted through January, but could be going up if the Securities and Exchange Commission green-lights Canary Capital's proposed Pudgy Penguin ETF, which will hold PENGU tokens as well as up to 15% of its assets in Pudgy Penguin NFTs.

PENGU is up about 2% on the day and 16% on the week, according to The Defiant's price data.

Home | Updates | Barcelona court investigates football stars in NFT scam

World Cup winners and ex-Barcelona players face allegations of fraud linked to a crypto company's opaque and tax-evading structure. 

A Barcelona court has launched a criminal probe into Shirtum Europa SLU, a crypto firm accused of defrauding investors of $3.4 million through a failed NFT scheme. Several elite footballers, including World Cup winners and former Barcelona stars, are named in the case after promoting the venture.

The NFTs tied to footballer image rights and sold via the $SHI token were marketed as exclusive collectables but were never tradable or backed by a functioning platform.

Founders allegedly used a complex corporate structure to evade taxes and siphon funds, with footballers acting as public faces to boost credibility. 

The footballers are ‘Papu' Gómez, Lucas Ocampos, Ivan Rakitić, Javier Saviola, Nico Pareja, and Alberto Moreno. Reports suggest ‘Papu' Gómez recruited others after presenting himself as a company founder before all promotional material was removed from social media.

The scandal exposes problems in Spanish football's crypto partnerships, as a gambling ad ban left a sponsorship gap that crypto firms filled. Many clubs face unpaid fees, and experts warn big names may mislead investors.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Solana Eyes $180 as Solaxy ICO Heats Up With $46M Raised","https://www.analyticsinsight.net/news/solana-eyes-180-as-solaxy-ico-heats-up-with-46m-raised","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Solana (SOL) is building momentum once more. Its value is hovering around $165, with analysts predicting a breakout above $180. Fueling some of that optimism is Solaxy, a new project referred to as Solana's first Layer-2 network. The project's ICO is currently in its last six days and has already seen over $46 million raised.

Solaxy is a rollup Layer-2 solution developed on Solana. It targets congestion on the Solana mainnet by accumulating transactions off-chain and settling them on-chain. This has the potential to accelerate the network and lower the number of failed transactions, a major issue during previous bull runs.

The presale of Solaxy is gaining momentum. The price of the SOLX token currently stands at $0.00175, and the price goes up every 48 hours. It is reported that staking rewards are going as high as 87% APY for those buying early. With only a week to go, investor appetite is still high.

Solaxy has already rolled out the testnet, bridge, and block explorer. These enable users to try bridging from Solana's Devnet and play around with early features. Yet more is coming in the form of a decentralised exchange (DEX) and Igniter, a token launchpad designed to compete with the likes of Pumpfun.

While the numbers and roadmap sound promising, not everything is clear. Much of the media coverage surrounding Solaxy appears to be sponsored. The project's mainnet is not live, and there is no confirmed launch date. Some investors worry that the hype could outpace actual progress.

SOL has posted consistent gains in recent days. Technical charts indicate a likely breakout above $170, with resistance likely around $180–$200. On-chain indicators also indicate higher activity from institutional investors and large holders.

Solaxy's success would have a direct influence on Solana's momentum. Solaxy, in the event that it delivers and meets expectations, would scale Solana and bring long-term value to the ecosystem. However, if the project doesn't live up to expectations, SOL's rally will fizzle out.

With six days remaining in the Solaxy ICO and Solana near a critical resistance point, the market is keenly observing. This instant may define both Solana's near-term price and Solaxy's long-term reputation. Technical indicators are gradually aligning themselves in the cryptocurrency's favor while investors are optimistic, but guarded.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","Japan's CBDC pilot continues but launch remains uncertain","https://coingeek.com/japan-cbdc-pilot-continues-but-launch-remains-uncertain/","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 09:00:58 GMT","

The central bank of Japan has no immediate plans to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) but is continuing to explore the digital yen in a pilot program.

Speaking at the ninth CBDC Liaison Council meeting with private sector partners on June 2, Bank of Japan (BOJ) Director Kazunari Kamiyama cited the country's continued high cash usage as a primary factor in the decision to rule out a CBDC, at least for the foreseeable future.

The comments produced a somewhat mixed message coming as they did ten days after the central bank released a second progress report on its digital yen pilot program, which involves seven working groups and 64 private companies through the CBDC Forum.

These groups are tasked with exploring different aspects of digital currency development through both technical implementation and theoretical research. For example, one working group is looking at how CBDCs can integrate with emerging technologies, such as distributed ledger technology (DLT)—the foundation of blockchain technology.

Building on blockchain

As part of the study, researchers considered deploying a CBDC on a public blockchain, but concluded the approach wasn't currently viable due to scalability limitations, privacy concerns, and governance challenges.

While this avenue to a widescale CBDC was deemed unfeasible, the pilot did identify other potential future pathways, including layer 2 blockchains—secondary frameworks built on top of a layer 1 blockchain (e.g. Ethereum)—that can offer increased scalability and reduce transaction costs.










 
The pilot program also explored using CBDCs to settle security token transactions on permissioned blockchains—not publicly accessible blockchains—though this approach would require pre-funding mechanisms.

Another avenue explored was issuing a digital asset backed by a CBDC, similar to a stablecoin. However, it was noted that this would require strict wallet and smart contract whitelisting.

API or webhook

Outside of the foundation technology on which a hypothetical digital yen would be built, the research also explored the need for modular, basic application programming interfaces (APIs) that could be combined to create more sophisticated applications.

APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols.

While APIs offer valuable functionality, the pilot program found that excessive usage could create performance bottlenecks. For instance, frequent API calls to verify transaction completion could strain the system.

Instead, the research report favored ‘webhooks', which are data and executable commands sent from one app or system to another when an event occurs, rather than being request-based like APIs. While APIs may give more control, webhooks can be faster for real-time updates without needing to keep requesting the new data.

The researchers leant toward webhook technology due to its ability to reverse the data flow by pushing notifications to users when transactions are completed.

The working groups have so far examined these various features separately, but the central bank said it plans to explore how different elements interact across the system.

Thus, despite having no immediate issuance plans, Japan will continue its CBDC research efforts. Meaning, a digital yen is not off the table entirely.

Watch: CBDCs are more than just digital money

While the country has long adhered to a “cash is king” ethos, the share of cashless payments in Japan jumped from 13.2% in 2010 to 42.8% last year, Reuters reported Wednesday (June 11), citing government data.

Japan has trailed other countries in payments technology, but the rise of cashless transactions has forced the government to make sure it is ready to handle the shift. That means the possible establishment of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), the report said.

Although there has been no decision on the creation of a digital yen, the BOJ began a CDBC pilot in 2023. This made the country one of the largest economies in the world to progress to the pilot stage of developing a CBDC.

The central bank has been consulting with private companies and the government on the framework and design of the coin, according to the report.

“Although banknote issuance remains high in Japan, usage of notes could fall significantly in the future amid rapid digitalization,” BOJ Executive Director Kazushige Kamiyama said in a meeting last week with private firms involved with the pilot program, per the report. “As such, Japan must consider what steps it can take now to ensure its retail settlement system is convenient, efficient, accessible universally, while being safe and resilient.”

BOJ Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida said a CBDC may become “a critical piece of infrastructure” guiding the future of Japan's payment and settlement systems, but he maintained that he did not foresee demand for cash fading in Japan in the near future, according to the report.

Meanwhile, the use of cash in payments continues to drop in other parts of the world. For example, in-store cash transactions in Latin America fell from 67% in 2014 to 25% last year, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report “Digital Developments: Charting Digital Payment Growth in Latin America.” This share is expected to drop to 17% by 2030.

In the United States, the Treasury Department plans to phase out the penny, the country's smallest form of physical currency.

“In 2024, it cost nearly 3.7 cents to produce a single penny — almost four times its face value — resulting in annual losses exceeding $56 million for the U.S. Mint,” PYMNTS wrote May 31.

A $1 million mansion in Kentucky owned by the crypto bros jailed for allegedly torturing a man for his digital coins was raided by authorities Tuesday.

The six-bedroom waterfront home in Smithland — which appears to be styled after the White House — was bought by self-styled “Crypto King of Kentucky” John Woeltz and his business partner William Duplessie for $1 million cash in January, multiple sources told The Post.

The house was raided by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and the NYPD, with support from the Kentucky State Police, according to a release from authorities.

Video of the raid obtained by The Post shows armored vehicles being brought by truck into the town, which has a population of less than 300, and a series of unmarked black SUVs and trucks at the property. It is unclear if anyone was there at the time of the raid.

Authorities have yet to say if anything was recovered from the property. Sources say one of the more unusual features of the house is a series of tunnels under it, accessible from the main house.

Woeltz, 33, and Duplessie, 37, are in jail over charges they allegedly held an associate, Michael Carturan, captive in another house they were renting in New York. They are alleged to have tortured him with a chainsaw while attempting to get him to hand over the password for his digital wallet containing $28 million in cryptocurrency over 17 days in May, according to prosecutors.

A neighbor who lived opposite Woeltz and Duplessie in Smithland told The Post: “The two men we now know as the ‘crypto bros' purchased the property at 101.

“There was talk they were looking at making the mansion a venue for events. They joined local societies and stuff like that and were trying to fit in.

“But there were all kinds of rumors going around. There was an awful lot of traffic, cars coming and going nonstop and stuff. At the same time there was an undercurrent that something wasn't right,” said Joshua Johnson, who lived opposite the mansion until recently.

New evidence against the pair was presented at a hearing Wednesday, where prosecutors accused them of holding another two people against their will and unveiled new evidence, including a photo of them setting Carturan, an Italian national, on fire.

Woeltz and Duplessie are charged with kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment and have both pleaded not guilty. Lawyers for both did not comment for this article.

Property deeds for the house obtained by The Post show it was bought by a Wyoming LLC, which was incorporated just weeks before the January 27 sale.

A source close to the sale told The Post: “Their cash was good and that's all I know.”

The stunning property boasts 10 bathrooms, an outdoor swimming pool and a tennis court, and sits on the bank of the Ohio River. Is known locally as the Strait house, after the family who previously lived there.

Carturan had raised the alarm against them after escaping from the house on Prince Street where he claimed he had been held and flagging down a traffic officer on May 23.

During their time in New York, Woeltz and Duplessie, who hails from Connecticut, gained a reputation for their hard partying and lavish spending. ","{'href': 'https://nypost.com', 'title': 'New York Post'}","cryptocurrency"

To extend everyday payments, remittances, and 'PayFi' solutions to millions of users and merchants 

NEW YORK, June 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- PayPal today announced plans to make the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin available on the Stellar network pending regulatory approval by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)1. Stellar is a blockchain designed for fast, low-cost payments and real-world utility. By potentially expanding to Stellar, PYUSD leverages the network's speed, low transaction costs, and ease of integration to enhance its utility for real-world payments, commerce, and micro-financing, offering an additional option to Ethereum and Solana.



PYUSD on Stellar can be used for fast, affordable cross-border payments and expanded access to essential financial services while bridging the digital and physical world with a vast array of on and off ramps. Users may also benefit from improved daily payment options and financing solutions such as working capital and business loans - use cases already thriving on the Stellar network - ultimately enabling a more seamless flow of value across global markets.

""For years, stablecoins have been deemed crypto's 'killer app' by combining the power of the blockchain with the stability of fiat currency. As we see cross border payments being a key area where digital currencies can provide real world value, working with Stellar will help advance the use of this technology and provide benefits for all users,"" said May Zabaneh, Vice President of the Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and Digital Currency Group, PayPal.

An expansion on Stellar would give PYUSD users access to its vast network of on and off ramps, providing additional access through digital wallets, and connected to local payment systems and cash networks. Access to extensive Stellar infrastructure will enhance how people can use PYUSD in their everyday financial activities, from payments to remittances to merchant services.

""Stellar is the network for fast, low-cost, and trusted global payments at scale. By bringing PYUSD to 170+ countries, we're transforming stablecoins into practical financial tools that millions of everyday users and merchants can actually use,"" shared Denelle Dixon, Chief Executive Officer of Stellar Development Foundation. ""Together, we are bringing stable digital currency to small businesses and individuals in emerging markets all over the globe.""

PYUSD on Stellar can also enhance liquidity and financing opportunities through Payment Financing or 'PayFi', an emerging innovation in digital finance. Small and medium-sized businesses that face delayed receivables or pre-funding requirements would be able to access new sources of real-time working capital, disbursed in PYUSD. This capital can be used to pay suppliers, manage inventory, or address other operational needs – with instant settlement on Stellar. Liquidity providers can fund these opportunities and earn potential, sustainable benefits from real-world economic activity. 

PYUSD on Stellar can drive efficient modernized money movement, cost transparency, and minimize settlement delays by unlocking better borderless financial flows.

Oops, something went wrong

By Leika Kihara

TOKYO (Reuters) -Bank of Japan officials are ramping up calls to keep pace with rapid developments around digital currencies that may accelerate a shift to cashless payments in a country better known for its belief that ""cash is king.""

Once seen as a society favouring physical currency, Japan saw the ratio of cashless payments rise to 42.8% in 2024, up from 13.2% in 2010 and hitting the government's 40% goal a year earlier than targeted, government data showed.

While Japan is a global laggard on payment technology, the increase in cashless transactions is forcing policymakers to ensure they are ready to adapt to shifting public preference on payment and settlement means.

This includes the option of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). While no decision has been made on whether to issue a digital yen, the BOJ began a pilot programme for developing a CBDC in 2023, and has been consulting with private firms and the government on its framework and design.

""Although banknote issuance remains high in Japan, usage of notes could fall significantly in the future amid rapid digitalisation,"" BOJ Executive Director Kazushige Kamiyama told a meeting last week with private firms on the pilot programme.

""As such, Japan must consider what steps it can take now to ensure its retail settlement system is convenient, efficient, accessible universally, while being safe and resilient.""

BOJ Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida said a CBDC may become ""a critical piece of infrastructure"" shaping the future of Japan's payment and settlement systems, but stressed that he did not expect demand for cash to disappear in Japan any time soon.

In his speech on Saturday, Uchida spoke about a hypothetical world in which the yen is overtaken by another instrument - such as crypto assets - as the main form of payment in Japan.

Such a world would not occur as long as the public believes in the BOJ's ability to keep the value of the yen stable, which could come into question if the central bank fails to fulfil its mission of price stability, Uchida said.

""Looking to the future, in a society that has made significant advances in digitalization, there is no guarantee that currency issued by the central bank of a sovereign nation will continue to function as a generally acceptable payment instrument,"" he said.

CBDCs are back in the spotlight after U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in January banning the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar, seemingly as part of a drive to promote cryptocurrencies and stablecoins instead.

The growing presence of stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies backed by a hard currency, and the potential risk of an erosion in the U.S. dollar's dominance have also piled pressure on central banks to consider issuing their own digital currencies.

The European Central Bank has called for the need to issue a digital euro to respond to Trump's push to promote stablecoins, and develop an electronic means of payment that does not rely on dominant U.S. providers such as Visa.

China is racing ahead with global ambitions to internationalise the yuan with transactions of the digital yuan more than tripling between June 2023 and June 2024.

Crypto wallet infrastructure company Privy has agreed to be acquired by payments giant Stripe, the two companies announced on Wednesday. 

The acquisition, which is expected to close in the coming weeks, will bring Privy under the Stripe umbrella, but allow it to continue operating as an independent product. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

“Money has to reside somewhere, and Privy builds the world's best programmable vaults,” Stripe CEO Patrick Collison posted on X (formerly Twitter). “Alongside our other stablecoin work, we're looking forward to enabling a new generation of global, internet-native financial services.”

Active crypto users participating with consumer applications have likely already interacted with Privy, without even knowing it.

Best known for its embedded wallet technology, Privy allows developers to build simpler onboarding experiences, like letting users create crypto wallets without the complexity of memorizing or recording seed phrases. 

Additionally, Privy's embedded wallets let users hold assets or take actions directly within supported crypto apps, instead of needing to connect a third-party wallet like MetaMask to perform transactions. 

In just three years, Privy's technologies have become widely adopted across the industry, supporting more than 75 million accounts and 1,000 developer teams, the firm said—including major crypto applications like Pump.fun, Hyperliquid, OpenSea, and more. 

By joining Stripe, it plans to accelerate that pace even more.

1/ Today, we're proud to announce that Stripe is acquiring Privy.

We couldn't be more excited.

Privy will continue as an independent product – but now we'll move faster, ship more, and serve you even better, so you can stay focused on your users. pic.twitter.com/8CHJqhqYy7

— Privy (@privy_io) June 11, 2025



“Today, digital ownership and the financial systems that run the modern world are intersecting as never before,” the firm wrote Wednesday. “Like us, Stripe believes in the power of bringing crypto and fiat closer together, marrying these systems so deeply that the distinction becomes almost meaningless.” 

“Joining Stripe will accelerate our work to shape this future and provide powerful new capabilities to Stripe and Privy customers alike,” it continued. “Together, we can change how value moves through the internet.”

The acquisition is another piece of Stripe's further entwinement with crypto, having announced plans for stablecoin financial accounts in May.

In October, the payments firm acquired stablecoin payment platform Bridge for $1.1 billion after integrating Avalanche's layer-1 blockchain earlier in the year. 

Stipe was among the first payment companies to accept Bitcoin back in 2014, but it shuttered its service in 2018 before returning its focus to crypto last year. 

A representative for Privy did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment. A Stripe representative pointed to Collison's X thread as the firm's official comment.

Brian Quintenz, President Donald Trump's pick for Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), stated during a nomination hearing on Tuesday that he would focus on a tech-first approach toward crypto regulations under his administration.

During a nomination hearing with members of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, President Trump's CFTC nominee, Brian Quintenz, stated that the CFTC would adopt a tech-forward approach toward cryptocurrency regulations if Congress grants it oversight authority.

He emphasized that the CFTC possesses the technological capability and regulatory experience necessary to oversee the digital asset market effectively.

Senator Ben Luján inquired about his plans to address anti-money laundering (AML) breaches related to cryptocurrency, citing that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has recently stepped back from enforcement. Quintenz said that crypto providers would likely be subject to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) laws, which currently regulate other financial entities. 

When asked about a crypto market structure bill, Quintenz shared that he views the legislation as a way to combine customer protection with innovation.

""I have always viewed market structure legislation as an opportunity to be both pro-customer protection and pro-innovation at the same time,"" Quintenz stated.

Quintenz further answered questions on prediction markets, drawing from his experience as a board member at Kalshi. He defended event contracts as legitimate financial instruments, describing them as effective tools for hedging real-world risks.

""I believe the Commodity Exchange Act is very clear about the purpose of derivatives markets, the purpose of risk management and price discovery, and that events can serve a function in that mandate,"" he said.

Before accepting the presidential nomination to be CFTC Chairman, Quintenz worked as a16z Crypto's Global Head of Policy, where he collaborated with several cryptocurrency startups.

He stated at the hearing that this could be the most exciting time to lead as Chairman of the agency, considering the larger shift toward crypto regulations. Quintenz also previously worked as a CFTC Commissioner from 2017 to 2021 and has been an advocate of innovation.

If approved by the Committee, he will proceed to a full Senate vote before being inaugurated as the new CFTC Chairman by President Trump.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales appear to be in a risk-off mode ahead of the pivotal U.S. inflation data, which is likely to show a renewed uptick due to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Major whale transactions exceeding $100,000 have crashed by 91.5% over the past four days, shifting market control from institutional to retail investors, according to CoinDesk's AI insights.

Prices, however, have raised bulls' hopes, topping key resistance at 0.0000133 with a massive 975 billion volume spike. The cryptocurrency has also moved above the widely-watched 100-day simple moving average (SMA).

Additionally, a record 1.5 million wallets now hold SHIB tokens, representing 0.011% of the global population, a sign of accelerated community growth.

According to FactSet, the median year-over-year estimate for the consumer price index for May is 2.5%, an increase from April's 2.3% rise.

If the data matches estimates, it will be the first increase in the number compared to the previous month since January 2025, validating the Federal Reserve's wait-and-see, data-dependent stance.

That said, the tariff-led upswing in inflation has been discussed in markets for some time, and the confirmation may not come as a shock to the market. In other words, dips could be short-lived.

PayPal (PYPL) is bringing its PYUSD stablecoin to the Stellar blockchain network to strengthen the dollar-pegged token's position in cross-border remittances and payment financing, the companies said on Wednesday.

PYUSD, which already operates on Ethereum and Solana, will expand to Stellar to explore new areas like payment financing, or ""PayFi"". This allows small and medium-sized businesses that face delayed receivables or pre-funding requirements to access new sources of real-time working capital, disbursed in PYUSD, according to a press release.

That capital can be used to pay suppliers, manage inventory or address other operational needs with instant settlement on Stellar, the companies said.

Stablecoins, digital tokens whose value is pegged to a real-world asset, rose to popularity as a way to trade in and out of cryptocurrencies without having to convert to fiat cash. More recently, much of the action has been on the rapid growth of cross border remittances and other innovations within the payments arena.

""For years, stablecoins have been deemed crypto's ‘killer app' by combining the power of the blockchain with the stability of fiat currency. As we see cross border payments being a key area where digital currencies can provide real world value, working with Stellar will help advance the use of this technology and provide benefits for all users,"" said May Zabaneh, PayPal's vice president for blockchain, cryptocurrency and digital currencies.

The partnership announcement has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which requires a final review of the product integration before going live, Stellar said via email.

Bitcoin BTC$109,600.86 stayed steady above $109,500 in Asian morning hours Wednesday, a rebound that started after last week's profit-taking.

However, all eyes are on ether ETH$2,864.07 with traders commenting on upside volatility in the weeks to come and reporting record volumes for certain ETH-based products on some exchanges. ETH zoomed 5% in the past 24 hours, leading gains among majors.

“Investors are finally recognizing the compelling investment opportunity that Ethereum presents. It's still trading well below its all-time highs, while bitcoin is already near its ATH levels,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, in a message to CoinDesk. 

He pointed to Ethereum's growing role in tokenizing real-world assets like stocks, money-market funds, and U.S. Treasuries, adding that it was “very likely that Ethereum will reach and/or surpass its all-time high price by the end of the year.”

Ether ETFs have attracted more than $800 million in the past two weeks alone, outpacing bitcoin's sub-$400 million, according to SoSoValue data. That's helped the spread between ether's implied volatility and bitcoin's reach its highest level since late 2022 — a sign traders expect bigger price swings ahead.

Open interest in ether perpetuals on Kraken hit an all-time high of 30,000 ETH this week, said Alexia Theodorou, Head of Derivatives at Kraken, in an email to CoinDesk.

“This signals a notable uptick in speculative activity around the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap,” she noted. However, she cautioned that the market “has yet to form a clear directional consensus,” with the long/short ratio still well below January levels.

Elsewhere in the market, Solana SOL$166.25 and Cardano ADA$0.71887 posted gains of 4.7% and 3.3%, respectively, adding to the risk-on tone, while XRP XRP$2.32 rose 2% to $2.30. Ethereum beta bet dogecoin DOGE$0.20191 climbed 3.7% to reverse all of last week's losses.

Traders are closely watching upcoming U.S. CPI data on Wednesday, which could sway Federal Reserve rate expectations and shape risk sentiment ahead of next week's meeting.

 Although the bill would allow the National Bank of Ukraine to acquire crypto assets like Bitcoin as part of state reserves, it would not require the bank to do so. 

Ukrainian lawmakers have introduced a draft bill that would allow the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in the country's reserves.

Submitted to Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, on Tuesday, bill number 13356 proposes amendments to the law “On the National Bank of Ukraine” regarding the inclusion of crypto assets alongside gold and foreign currencies.

While authorizing the central bank to acquire cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) as part of state reserves, the bill would not require the authority to do so, according to Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a member of parliament who confirmed the introduction of the bill on his Telegram channel.

The central bank would retain full discretion over whether to allocate any portion of its reserves to crypto, how much to allocate and when to do so.

“How, when and how much should be the decision of the regulator itself,” Zhelezniak said.

Although leaving the final decision to the NBU, the lawmakers support the creation of a potential state crypto asset reserve as a step that will integrate the country into global financial innovations, Zhelezniak said.

“Proper management of crypto reserves will help strengthen macroeconomic stability and create new opportunities for the development of the digital economy,” he wrote in a statement on Telegram.

Zhelezniak discussed the potential state crypto reserve in a video commentary with Binance's regional head for Central and Eastern European countries and Central Asia, Kyrylo Khomiakov, who helped the lawmakers write the draft bill. Khomiakov's involvement in the bill-making follows reports suggesting Binance has been advising multiple governments on setting up crypto reserves.

Additionally, contributors to the bill included Petr Bilyk, head of artificial intelligence practice at the local law firm Juscutum Legal Engineering and a member of Ukraine's expert committee on AI development.

In the video, Zhelezniak emphasized that the introduction of the draft bill does not mean the Ukrainian government is actively campaigning for crypto, but rather does not want to miss out on the growing adoption worldwide.

“This story has the right to life, and, as we see, many countries are implementing it,” the lawmaker said, referring to global governments like the United States and El Salvador increasingly experimenting with state crypto reserves.

The news follows reports on Ukraine nearing the final stages of introducing a draft bill on a state cryptocurrency reserve. The initiative came amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, with nations continuing to work on a potential peace deal.

 Bitcoin moves in the “opposite direction of retail's expectations,” which may lead to a price surge lag, Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan tells Cointelegraph. 

The market's expectation of Bitcoin surging to new highs could prevent it from happening in the near term, but that doesn't rule out the possibility of Ether surprising investors, analysts say.

Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan told Cointelegraph on Wednesday that the analytics firm is “seeing an anticipation for Bitcoin's next ‘all-time high' across social media. Since markets move the opposite direction of retail's expectations, this usually is a sign that we aren't quite ready for another bullish surge yet.”

Quinlivan suggested the lack of doubt has proven that all-time highs tend not to follow, but with Bitcoin (BTC) having verged on all-time highs a handful of times now, sentiment has moved into a lower position to propel Bitcoin above its current peak.

Bitcoin is trading at $109,679 at the time of publication, just 2.1% off its $111,970 all-time high, which it reached on May 22, according to CoinMarketCap.

“It wouldn't be surprising if we do break through very soon after we see a few frustrating ‘close calls' that cause small traders to turn sour and impatient on BTC, neutralizing this level of optimism,” Quinlivan said. 

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures overall market sentiment, is reading a “Greed” score of 72 out of 100.

Derive head of research Dr Sean Dawson told Cointelegraph he thinks Bitcoin “will likely underperform” in the third quarter of this year.

Since 2013, the third quarter of each year has historically been Bitcoin's weakest, averaging a 6.03% return, while the following quarter has been the strongest, delivering an average return of 85.42%, according to CoinGlass data.

Dawson pointed to macroeconomic uncertainty as a significant concern for traders. “Despite political pressure for rate cuts, the Fed seems poised to keep interest rates steady, which could dampen Bitcoin's appeal for outsized returns,” he said.

99.9% of market participants expect the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates the same at 4.25% to 4.50% on June 18, according to CME's FedWatch tool.

While uncertainty remains about Bitcoin, Quinlivan pointed out the “high level of optimism toward Ethereum.”

“More and more eyes have turned to Ethereum,” he said, adding that the asset has been “playing catch-up since markets began their recovery in mid-April.” Ether (ETH) reached a low of $1,472 on April 9, but has since recovered to $2,793 by the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

“Bitcoin's jump over the past couple of months has, of course, allowed profit redistributions to allow other market caps to achieve. And it really wasn't clear until ETH was really seeing maximum bearishness a couple of months ago.”

Meanwhile, Dawson said that overall crypto trading volume may decline in the near term, as the arrival of summer in the Northern Hemisphere leads many investors to take vacations.

“This seasonal lull raises the chances of sideways movement or even sharp pullbacks, as traders take profits from earlier gains,” Dawson said.

Animal Lifespans Offer Clues about the Science of Aging

Could the spectrum of animal lifespans hold clues about the science of aging?

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura 

Anaissa Ruiz Tejada/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

In the animal kingdom lifespans can stretch from mere hours to entire centuries, but that's just the start. Some creatures deteriorate so slowly that we've never actually caught them dying of old age. Others don't seem to age at all. And some can apparently reset their biological clocks and bounce back to infancy to start all over again.

Plenty of humans would like to figure out how that works—and potentially harness the ability for our own use. But science has a long way to go. The truth is that we barely understand why or how we age in the first place—let alone how we might stop it.

My guest today is João Pedro de Magalhães. He's the chair of molecular biogerontology at the University of Birmingham in England, and he's here to tell us all about the nascent science of aging.

Thank you so much for coming on to chat today.

João Pedro de Magalhães: My pleasure. Thank you for the invitation.

Feltman: So I'm sure that all of our listeners know that different species have different lifespans, but could you start by giving us a sense of some of the extremes that are out there?

Magalhães: Absolutely. It's been a mystery of biology for a very long time, ever since Aristotle noticed [these] differences in lifespan across species. And we know that some animals have very short lifespans; others have very long lifespans. And this happens even amongst closely related species like mammals. For example, hamsters live about two years; mice and rats can live up to three or four years; and, you know, of course, humans, we can live over 100 years. And then at the other end of the spectrum we have certain species of whales that have been estimated to live over 200 years ...

Feltman: Mm.

Magalhães: So it is quite remarkable how much of a variation in longevity there is.

Feltman: Yeah, and then, besides mammals, I would assume that things get even more extreme when you're talking about less closely related species.

Magalhães: Well, there's some very unusual animals. There's this type of jellyfish which appears to be immortal, or it appears to have the ability to rejuvenate, to go back in biological time, so adults can go back to earlier stages of development and start again their own lives. So it's not that they're immortal [in] that you can't kill them, but they are biologically immortal in the sense that biological time, for them, doesn't roll in one direction, like it happens for us.

Feltman: Mm.

Magalhães: So there's very unusual animals—again, we're talking invertebrates like rotifers or very simple animals—whose adults don't have mouths.

Feltman: Mm.

Magalhães: They don't have a way of feeding. So they're very clear examples of mechanical limitations that will result in the demise of organisms.

So you have a very big variety in terms of not just longevity and paces of aging but even in aging phenotypes and how species degenerate and die.

Feltman: And fundamentally, what is aging?

Magalhães: So aging, we are all familiar with it—I tend to have a very broad definition of aging as a, a progressive and inevitable physiological degeneration, an increase in vulnerability and decrease in viability.

Now, of course, there's many facets to aging. I mean, it involves physiological degeneration. I mean, our bodies get weaker. We become frailer with age. But there's also, of course, many cellular, molecular changes that occur as well. And then, of course, there's increased incidence of diseases: cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, and so on.

So one of the hallmarks of aging is that once you reach about age 30 your chance of dying [doubles] roughly every eight years, and that's very consistent across populations. And that happens as well in animals, only in animals like mice, it varies a bit between strains, but it'll be something like every few months the chance of dying doubles.

Feltman: Hmm, and what do we know about what causes aging? You know, why is it inevitable for most species, but then, you know, for some, like those jellyfish, it doesn't seem to be?

Magalhães: Well, that's a big question, and we don't have a good answer yet. We don't have a good understanding why some species age very fast. So for example, mice and rats, as I mentioned, they only live up to three or four years, but they also age much faster than human beings. No matter how you take care of them, a mouse will age about 20, 25, 30 times faster than a human being. So we know there's a very big diversity, also, in rates of aging, but what's behind it is not well-understood.

We know there must be genetic differences, again, because no matter how well you take care of your mouse or hamster or rat, it will age a lot faster than a human being. So, you know, you can let it watch Netflix all it wants, it will still age much faster than human beings, right? So there has to be genetic differences. It's not environment, it's not the diet; it has to be genetically determined—it has to be encoded in our genomes how fast we age. But then, of course, the question is, “Okay, but what [are] the biochemical, molecular, cellular determinants?” That's something we don't understand well yet.

Having said that, there are some hypotheses. For example, one idea that's been around for decades is the idea that damage to the DNA and mutations in the DNA accumulate gradually with age and then cause aging. And the hypothesis being that in mice, for example, [this] accumulation of mutations occurs much faster—for which there is some experimental evidence. So that is one hypothesis. And at the moment, however, it's still unproven or unknown, really, why human beings age.

Feltman: Hmm, and are there any factors that long-living organisms have in common?

Magalhães: There are multiple factors associated with long lifespans. I mean, the important point is that we are a product of our evolutionary history. Of course, we now have technology, and we have medicine, but we didn't evolve in these conditions; we evolved as, as [cavemen], you know, hundreds of thousands or millions of years ago. And the same for every other species.

And so the major determinant of whether a species evolves a short lifespan or a long lifespan is extrinsic mortality, so how much they die of—in particular, predation. So if you have animals like—short-lived animals like mice, I mean, mice in the wild very rarely live more than one year, not just because of diseases but primarily because of predators ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Magalhães: And because they have very short lifespans, even in the wild, then, you know, they have to grow very quickly, they have to develop very quickly, and they have to reproduce very quickly, and so everything happens very quickly. So it's a very fast life history, a very fast life that they live.

On the other hand, humans or the Galápagos tortoise would be an example or big whales or underground, subterranean animals like mole rats, they're protected from predators. I mean, we are protected from predators, one, because we're relatively big for primates and, of course, because of our intelligence, which [allowed] us to escape predators when we were, of course, in the time of cavemen and when we were evolving. And that means that because we have fewer predators, we are top of the food chain, that means that we have more time to grow, to develop, and then, of course, that leads to a longer lifespan as well.

So across species there's this pattern, of course, of, you know, we are a product of our evolution, and we have the life history and the longevity that fits our evolutionary history.

Feltman: What kinds of tools are researchers using to try to answer all of these questions we have about aging and lifespan?

Magalhães: So there's different types of tools we can use. I mean, one big technological breakthrough was DNA sequencing. We can sequence DNA relatively cheaply and relatively rapidly nowadays. I mean, the human genome sequencing cost billions of dollars, but nowadays you can sequence your own genome, anyone can sequence their genomes for [a] few hundred dollars.

So it's relatively cheap to sequence genomes, which means we can also sequence the genomes of different species, species with different lifespans. So for example, our lab, we sequenced the genome of the bowhead whale, which is the longest-lived mammal, [which has] been estimated to live over 200 years, as well as naked mole rats and other long-lived, disease-resistant species. And there's now hundreds of genome [sequences] from many different species with different lifespans.

And so what you can do with that trove of information is analyze it for patterns associated with the evolution of longevity. You can ask questions—so for example, you know, “Do species that live a longer lifespan, do they have more DNA repair genes?” So you can use that information on the DNA to study the evolution of longevity, then try to find specific genes and pathways associated with it.

Feltman: Mm.

Magalhães: Now, the other approach we use to study aging, of course, is in model systems. I mean, unfortunately we cannot really study aging in human beings—or we can, but it's very difficult and time-consuming—and so we tend to use short-lived model systems like mice or fruit flies or worms. [Some] worms live a few weeks. We tend to use fruit flies, Drosophila, that live a few months. Mice can live up to three, four years. So we can study these animals to try to gather insights into the mechanisms of aging, hoping that some of these will be applicable to humans. I mean, there's some rationale for it because we know the basic biochemistry of life in a mouse is quite similar to humans.

We can also manipulate aging to some degree in animal models, particularly at the genetic level. We can tweak genes in animals, including in mice, and extend their lifespan. In mice [it's] up to about 50 percent. But for example, in worms we can tweak a single gene in worms and extend by about 10 times ...

Feltman: Mm.

Magalhães: Which is quite remarkable. So we can do a lot of studies in animal models: we can manipulate aging to some degree in animals, and then we can do mechanistic studies. We can look at their molecules, we can look at their cells, we can look at their hormones and try to test mechanistic [hypotheses] of aging.

Feltman: What do you think are the biggest questions that we should be tackling about human aging and human lifespans?

Magalhães: Well, I suppose the big question is still why we age. I mean, why do human beings age? As I said, there's hypotheses like DNA damage and mutations, like oxidative damage, like loss of protein, homeostasis. There's different hypothesis, but we still don't know why we age, and I think that remains the big question in the field.

There's other questions, of course: Can we manipulate human aging? Because although we can manipulate, to some degree, aging in animal models, we don't know if that's possible or not in human beings. We can manipulate, to some degree, our longevity by exercise, eating healthy, not smoking, not drinking too much alcohol, and so on. But whether, for example, can we develop a longevity drug? And there's a number of companies and labs trying to develop longevity pills, and—but whether they're gonna be effective in humans, that's still something that's up to discussion and will require, for example, clinical trials.

Feltman: Mm.

Magalhães: So one aspect that's quite fundamental and important in, in aging is that there are complex species—like some species of reptiles like the Galápagos tortoise; some species of fishes, like rockfishes; some species in salamanders, like the olm—that appear not to age at all. There's no mammals in this category, but there are complex vertebrates that, in studies spanning decades, do not exhibit increased mortality, do not exhibit increased physiological degeneration. So that is quite a fascinating observation, that some species—I mean, maybe they do age after a very long time, but at the very least they age much, much, much slower than human beings ...

Feltman: Hmm.

Magalhães: Which I think is a great inspiration as well. Because, so, for example, just like the Wright brothers took inspiration from birds: they saw birds—“Well, birds are heavier than air, and yet they can fly, so there's no reason to think we cannot build a machine that's heavier than air and can make us fly.” We can take inspiration [from] these animals. There's no physical limit that [holds] that every organism has to age. And so we can take [inspiration] from the species that appear not to age and think, “Well, maybe with technology and, and therapeutics we can, at the very least, slow our aging process.”

Feltman: Thank you so much for coming on to talk today. This has been great.

Magalhães: Well, thank you. My pleasure.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. We'll be back on Friday.

Behold the First Images of the Sun's South Pole

Solar Orbiter isn't the first spacecraft to study the sun's poles—but it's the first to send back photographs

By Meghan Bartels edited by Lee Billings

We Earthlings see the sun every day of our lives—but gaining a truly new view of our star is a rare and precious thing. So count your lucky stars: for the first time in history, scientists have photographed one of the sun's elusive poles.

The images come courtesy of a spacecraft called Solar Orbiter. Led by the European Space Agency (ESA) with contributions from NASA, Solar Orbiter launched in February 2020 and has been monitoring our home star since November 2021. But the mission is only now beginning its most intriguing work: studying the poles of the sun.

From Earth and spacecraft alike, our view of the sun has been biased. “We've had a good view of centermost part of the sun's disk,” says Daniel Müller, a heliophysicist and project scientist for the mission. “But the poles are effectively not visible because we always see them almost exactly edge-on.”

We began getting a better perspective earlier this year, when Solar Orbiter zipped past Venus in a carefully choreographed move that pulled the probe out of the solar system's ecliptic, the plane that broadly passes through the planets' orbits and the sun's equator. (The new views show the sun's south pole and were captured in March. The spacecraft flew over the north pole in late April, Müller says, but Solar Orbiter is still in the process of beaming that data back to Earth.)

Leaving the ecliptic is a costly, fuel-expensive maneuver for spacecraft, but it's where Solar Orbiter excels: By the end of the mission, the spacecraft's orbit will be tilted 33 degrees with respect to the ecliptic. That tilted orbit is what allows Solar Orbiter to garner unprecedented views of the sun's poles.

Several views of the sun as seen by Solar Orbiter in March 2025. The three larger views show the sun in visible light, map the magnetic field at its surface, and show the sun in ultraviolet light. The smaller views show light coming from charged gas in the sun's atmosphere at different temperatures.

For scientists, the new view is priceless because these poles aren't just geographic poles; they're also magnetic poles—of sorts. The sun is a massive swirl of plasma that produces then erases a magnetic field. This is what drives the 11-year solar activity cycle.

At solar minimum, the lowest-activity part of the cycle, the sun's magnetic field is what scientists call a dipole: it looks like a giant bar magnet, with a strong pole at each end. But as the sun spins, the roiling plasma generates sunspots, dark, relatively cool patches on the sun's surface that are looping tangles of magnetic field lines. As sunspots arise and pass away, these tangles unfurl, and some of the leftover magnetic charge migrates to the nearest pole, where it offsets the polarity of the existing magnetic field. The result is a bizarre transitional state, with the sun's poles covered in a patchwork of localized “north” and “south” magnetic polarities.

In the solar maximum phase (which the sun is presently in), the magnetic field at each pole effectively disappears. (It can be a bumpy process—sometimes one pole loses its charge before the other, for example.) Then, as years pass and solar activity gradually declines, the continuing process of sunspots developing and dissipating creates a new magnetic field of the opposite charge at each pole until, eventually, the sun reaches its calm dipole state again.

These aren't matters of academic curiosity; the sun's activity affects our daily lives. Solar outbursts such as radiation flares and coronal mass ejections of charged plasma can travel across the inner solar system to reach our neighborhood, and they're channeled out of the sun by our star's ever changing magnetic fields. On Earth these outbursts can disrupt power grids and radio systems; in orbit they can interfere with communications and navigations satellites and potentially harm astronauts.

So scientists want to be able to predict this so-called space weather, just as they do terrestrial weather. But to do that, they need to better understand how the sun works—which is difficult to do with hardly a glimpse of the magnetic activity at and around our star's poles. That's where Solar Orbiter comes in.

Most of the spacecraft's observations won't reach Earth until this autumn. But ESA has released initial looks from three different instruments onboard Solar Orbiter, each of which lets scientists glimpse different phenomena.

Solar Orbiter's view of the magnetic fields around the sun's south pole. Patches of blue and red mark the mixed magnetic fields in this region that characterize solar maximum.

For example, the image above maps the magnetic field at the sun's surface. And from this view, Müller says, it's clear that the sun is at the maximum period of its activity cycle. Heliophysical models predict “a tangled mess of all these different patches of north and south polarity all over the place,” he says. “And that's exactly what we see.”

As their accordance with theoretical models suggests, the solar poles aren't entirely mysterious realms. That's in part because while Solar Orbiter is the first to beam back polar images, it isn't the first spacecraft to fly over these regions. That title belongs to Ulysses, a joint NASA-ESA mission that launched in 1990 and operated until 2009.

Ulysses carried a host of instruments designed to study radiation particles, magnetic fields, and more. And it used them to make many intriguing discoveries about our star and its curious poles. But it carried no cameras, so despite all its insights, Ulysses left those regions as sights unseen.

Fortunately, heliophysics has grown a lot since those days—and space agencies have learned that, in the public eye, a picture can be worth much more than 1,000 words. The result: Solar Orbiter can finally put the spotlight on the sun's poles.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Researchers Found Unnatural Patterns Beneath an Ancient Forest","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a65022728/menominee-michigan-farming/","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Experts are using LiDAR technology to learn more about the Indigenous Menominee people's agricultural prowess, which was more expansive than previously thought.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

At a glance, the Sixty Islands archaeological site—which reaches both sides of the Menominee River at the border of Michigan and Wisconsin—appears like any other patch of woods. But a closer look reveals ridges in the grass that nature could not have possibly made on its own.

This is the ancestral land of the Menominee people—an Indigenous tribe who had been farming the area since the 10th century. While the Menominee actually call themselves Mamaceqtaw (which translates to “the people”), surrounding tribes called them Menominee as a reference to the Algonquin word for wild rice, manomin. This is because they heavily relied on wild rice as food source.

The land containing the ridges is part of a region known as Anaem Omot, or “Dog's Belly,” which is known for Indigenous settlements that date to as far back as 10,000 years ago. And recently, as a team of researchers were studying the site using LiDAR, they realized that the ridges were part of an agricultural system involving raised ridge fields. This indicates that the Menominee had engaged in much more extensive farming than previously assumed. 

Sometimes the lack of evidence for what ancient people accomplished robs us of an accurate understanding of what they actually managed to do. There had been previous evidence of ancient Menominee farming in the area, but it was thought that they farmed on a much smaller scale than the newly discovered buried farmland would imply. 

The Menominee eventually began the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture. Despite the foreboding cold of Michigan winters, they were still able to cultivate maize, squash, beans, and other crops, as Madeleine McLeester (an  anthropologist from Dartmouth) found out when she and her research team surveyed around 330 acres of land. The raised fields that had been reinforced over thousands of years are still remarkably intact, and indicate a scale of farming that is ten times greater than what was previously accounted for. This new evidence is now disproving theories that the Menominee were mostly hunter-gatherers who may have done some farming for sustenance. 

“Our results demonstrate a rich anthropogenic landscape created by small-scale ancestral Menominee communities, located near the northern limits of maize agriculture,” McLeester said in a study recently published in the journal Science. Evidently, Menominee farming was carried out at a scale that would require sophisticated labor organization—something predominantly seen in larger hierarchical societies.

It was Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) that made it possible to see just how advanced Menominee agriculture was. Topographic LiDAR carried out by drone (like the one that was used to survey Anaem Omot) uses near-infrared laser light pulses to measure topographical features of the land below. When all of the the data collected by these drones is analyzed, it can create hyperreal 3D images of Earth's surface. Without grasses or trees in they way, the LiDAR map of Sixty Islands revealed the extent to which the agricultural ridges sprawled across the site.

Among the revelations provided by the LiDAR mapping was the fact that the ridges had been dug in different directions—something that could mean individual farmers determined which way to plant their crops without relying on outside influences (such as the direction of the Sun). Many ancient peoples who farmed allowed signs in nature (such as star alignment or where the wind was blowing from) to guide them. The farmers at this site might have relied on unknown signs or none at all. 

Additionally, through their survey of the area, the Dartmouth team observed burial mounds, a dance ring, and the remnants of logging camps from the 19th century. Excavations also unearthed artifacts such as ceramic fragments and charcoal, which McLeester thinks could mean that the Menominee made compost out of the dregs of firesand other household waste. Only 40% of the site has been surveyed so far, so the extensive agricultural system may still be even larger than we know.

“The excellent preservation of this site is exceptional in eastern North America,” McLeester said, “and suggests that the precolonial landscape was more anthropogenically influenced than currently recognized.”

Bad news for Just For Men.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

If only our pesky stem cells didn't get stuck in place after a while, maybe we wouldn't have gray hair. Really. 

In a study published in the journal Nature, researchers from New York University's Grossman School of Medicine revealed how stuck melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) can't make the protein needed to pigment hair, potentially explaining gray hair.

Using mice as the research subjects, the team found that McSCs travel between compartments of developing hair follicles in a healthy situation. The differing compartments allow the McSCs to mature and pick up the protein that can regenerate into pigment cells and continually color hair as it grows. These McSCs shift back and forth between maturity levels over time as they continually move between the compartments, a unique aspect of the McSCs.

But in some cases, the McSCs can get stuck in the hair follicle bulge compartment and become unable to move back to the germ compartment, where the WNT proteins encourage the cells to regenerate into pigment cells. Getting stuck means no pigment cells, which means gray hair.

“It is the loss of chameleon-like function in melanocyte stems cells that may be responsible for graying and loss of hair color,” Mayumi Ito, study senior investigator and professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology and Department of Cell Biology at NYU Langone Health, says in a news release. “These findings suggest that melanocyte stem cell motility and reversible differentiation are key to keeping hair healthy and colored.”

Basically, if the McSCs can keep moving—or, if they get stuck, we can somehow prod them to get going again—we should expect more colorful heads of hair the world over.

“Our study adds to our basic understanding of how melanocyte stem cells work to color hair,” Qi Sun, postdoctoral fellow at NYU Langone Health, says in the release. “The newfound mechanisms raise the possibility that the same fixed positioning of melanocyte stem cells may exist in humans. If so, it presents a potential pathway for reversing or preventing the graying of human hair by helping jammed cells to move again between developing hair follicle compartments.”

The McSCs focus on pigment-making, and are different from cells responsible for hair growth, Sun says, so hair can to continue growing even without pigment. The NYU study showed that as the hair regrowth process aged, the number of McSC's lodged in the follicle bulge continued to increase. At some points, this non-pigment producing follicle bulge contains roughly 50 percent of all McSCs.

The McSCs that remained mobile retained their ability to produce pigment, but with the ever-shifting requirements of McSCs breaking down over time, the rise of gray hair coincided with aging. And while stress has also been associated with graying hair, unrelated Harvard research says that stress simply increases the hair regrowth pattern, speeding up the aging process for hair follicles.

“For unknown reasons, the melanocyte stem cell system fails earlier than other adult stem cell populations, which leads to hair graying in most humans and mice,” according to the NYU study.

The next step for the NYU team involves looking at how we can get McSCs, once stuck, moving again. Because once they move, they create pigment. And that could mean the end of gray.

Medium-chain chlorinated paraffins, or MCCPs, have been detected in the air of Asia and Antarctica, but this surprise Oklahoma discovery is a first for North America.

One of the downsides of modern life is the proliferation of chemicals in the natural environment. Arguably the most well-known of these chemical culprits are per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are used for stuff like non-stick surfaces on frying pans. They are also known as “forever chemicals” for their tendency to linger in the environment. 

But this environmental scourge is only one of many similar substances. Of the others, one of the most concerning is a type of toxin known as medium-chain chlorinated paraffins, or MCCPs. Like PFAS, these chemicals take a longtime to break down, and have been shown to be the driver behind health issues like liver and kidney toxicity, thyroid malfunction, and certain neurological issues. MCCPs have been detected in the atmosphere on other continents (including Asia and even Antarctica) but a new study from the University of Colorado Boulder claims that North America has now joined that unlucky list.

In setting out to detect how aerosols form and grow in an agricultural region of Oklahoma, the team of scientists behind this recent study stumbled across trace amounts of MCCPs in the atmosphere. They detected these particles using a technique known as nitrate ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry, and the results were published last week in the journal ACS Environmental AU.

MCCPs start their lives within things like metalworking fluids, textiles, and PVC, which is why they can often find themselves in wastewater. That's a problem, because a fertilizer known as biosolids (which is made from treated sewar sludge) is often spread across agricultural crops.

“When sewage sludges are spread across the fields, those toxic compounds could be released into the air,” Daniel Katz, lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “We can't show directly that that's happening, but we think it's a reasonable way that they could be winding up in the air. Sewage sludge fertilizers have been shown to release similar compounds.”

The creation of this synthetic chemical was in large part due to the regulation of its toxic cousin, Short Chain Chlorinated Paraffins (SCCPs), which have been regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Stockholm Convention (an international body formed in 2001 to protect human health against persistent organic pollutants). Earlier this year, the Stockholm Convention also marked MCCPs for global elimination. Who knows if this will spawn the creation of another toxic chemical, but this regulatory game of whack-a-mole is similar in the truly Sisyphean task of trying to eliminate PFAS from the environment.

“We always have these unintended consequences of regulation, where you regulate something, and then there's still a need for the products that those were in,” Ellie Browne, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “So they get replaced by something.”

Luckily, there is some good news. The Oklahoma Senate passed a bill earlier this year eliminating biosolids as a fertilizer, and a newly established environmental group called The Coalition for Sludge-Free Land aims to make the ban a national one (the EPA currently regulates, but doesn't ban, the substance). Now that MCCPs have been found in the atmosphere, the UC Boulder team hopes that future efforts will be able to discern their airborne impact.

“We identified them, but we still don't know exactly what they do when they are in the atmosphere, and they need to be investigated further,” Katz said in a press statement. “I think it's important that we continue to have governmental agencies that are capable of evaluating the science and regulating these chemicals as necessary for public health and safety.”

How can the strange properties of quantum particles be exploited to perform extremely accurate measurements? This question is at the heart of the research field of quantum metrology. One example is the atomic clock, which uses the quantum properties of atoms to measure time much more accurately than would be possible with conventional clocks.

However, the fundamental laws of quantum physics always involve a certain degree of uncertainty. Some randomness or a certain amount of statistical noise has to be accepted. This results in fundamental limits to the accuracy that can be achieved. Until now, it seemed to be an immutable law that a clock twice as accurate requires at least twice as much energy. But now a team of researchers from TU Wien, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, and University of Malta have demonstrated that special tricks can be used to increase accuracy exponentially. The crucial point is using two different time scales - similar to how a clock has a second hand and a minute hand.

 What exactly is a clock? 

""We have analyzed in principle, which clocks could be theoretically possible,"" says Prof. Marcus Huber from the Atomic Institute at the TU Wien. ""Every clock needs two components: first, a time base generator - such as a pendulum in a pendulum clock, or even a quantum oscillation. And second, a counter - any element that counts how many time units defined by the time base generator have already passed.""

The time base generator can always return to exactly the same state. After one complete oscillation, the pendulum of a pendulum clock is exactly where it was before. After a certain number of oscillations, the caesium atom in an atomic clock returns to exactly the same state it was in before. The counter, on the other hand, must change - otherwise the clock is useless.

""This means that every clock must be connected to an irreversible process,"" says Florian Meier from TU Wien. ""In the language of thermodynamics, this means that every clock increases the entropy in the universe; otherwise, it is not a clock."" The pendulum of a pendulum clock generates a little heat and disorder among the air molecules around it, and every laser beam that reads the state of an atomic clock generates heat, radiation and thus entropy.

""We can now consider how much entropy a hypothetical clock with extremely high precision would have to generate - and, accordingly, how much energy such a clock would need,"" says Marcus Huber. ""Until now, there seemed to be a linear relationship: if you want a thousand times the precision, you have to generate at least a thousand times as much entropy and expend a thousand times as much energy.""

 Quantum time and classical time 

However, the research team at TU Wien, together with the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW) in Vienna and the teams from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, and University of Malta, has now shown that this apparent rule can be circumvented by using two different time scales.

""For example, you can use particles that move from one area to another to measure time, similar to how grains of sand indicate the time by falling from the top of the glass to the bottom,"" says Florian Meier. You can connect a whole series of such time-measuring devices in series and count how many of them have already passed through - similar to how one clock hand counts how many laps the other clock hand has already completed.

""This way, you can increase accuracy, but not without investing more energy,"" says Marcus Huber. ""Because every time one clock hand completes a full rotation and the other clock hand is measured at a new location - you could also say every time the environment around it notices that this hand has moved to a new location - the entropy increases. This counting process is irreversible.""

However, quantum physics also allows for another kind of particle transport: the particles can also travel through the entire structure, i.e. across the entire clock dial, without being measured anywhere. In a sense, the particle is then everywhere at once during this process; it has no clearly defined location until it finally arrives - and only then is it actually measured, in an irreversible process that increases entropy.

Like second and minute clock hands

""So we have a fast process that does not cause entropy - quantum transport - and a slow one, namely the arrival of the particle at the very end,"" explains Yuri Minoguchi, TU Wien. ""The crucial thing about our method is that one hand behaves purely in terms of quantum physics, and only the other, slower hand actually has an entropy-generating effect.""

The team has now been able to show that this strategy enables an exponential increase in accuracy per increase in entropy. This means that much higher precision can be achieved than would have been thought possible according to previous theories. ""What's more, the theory could be tested in the real world using superconducting circuits, one of the most advanced quantum technologies currently available.,"" says Simone Gasparinetti, co-author of the study and leader of the experimental team at Chalmers. ""This is an important result for research into high-precision quantum measurements and suppression of unwanted fluctuations,"" says Marcus Huber, ""and at the same time it helps us to better understand one of the great unsolved mysteries of physics: the connection between quantum physics and thermodynamics.""

Star TOI-6894 is just like many in our galaxy, a small red dwarf, and only ~20% of the mass of our Sun. Like many small stars, it is not expected to provide suitable conditions for the formation and hosting of a large planet.

However, as published today in Nature Astronomy, an international team of astronomers have found the unmistakable signature of a giant planet, called TOI-6894b, orbiting this tiny star.

This system has been discovered as part of a large-scale investigation of TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) data, looking for giant planets around low-mass stars, led by Dr. Edward Bryant, who completed this work at The University of Warwick and at UCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory.

Dr. Edward Bryant, Warwick Astrophysics Prize Fellow and first author said: ""I was very excited by this discovery. I originally searched through TESS observations of more than 91,000 low-mass red-dwarf stars looking for giant planets.

""Then, using observations taken with one of the world's largest telescopes, ESO's VLT, I discovered TOI-6894b, a giant planet transiting the lowest mass star known to date to host such a planet. We did not expect planets like TOI-6894b to be able to form around stars this low-mass. This discovery will be a cornerstone for understanding the extremes of giant planet formation.""

The planet (TOI-6894b) is a low-density gas giant with a radius a little larger than Saturn's but with only ~50% of Saturn's mass. The star (TOI-6894) is the lowest mass star to have a transiting giant planet discovered to date and is just 60% the size of the next smallest star to host such a planet.

Dr. Daniel Bayliss, Associate Professor at The University of Warwick said: ""Most stars in our Galaxy are actually small stars exactly like this, with low masses and previously thought to not be able to host gas giant planets. So, the fact that this star hosts a giant planet has big implications for the total number of giant planets we estimate exist in our Galaxy.""

A Challenge to the Leading Theory 

Dr Vincent Van Eylen, from UCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory, said: ""It's an intriguing discovery. We don't really understand how a star with so little mass can form such a massive planet! This is one of the goals of the search for more exoplanets. By finding planetary systems different from our solar system, we can test our models and better understand how our own solar system formed.""

The most widely held theory of planet formation is called the core accretion theory. A planetary core forms first through accretion (gradual accumulation of material) and as the core becomes more massive, it eventually attracts gases that form an atmosphere. It then gets massive enough to enter a runaway gas accretion process to become a gas giant.

In this theory, the formation of gas giants is harder around low-mass stars because the amount of gas and dust in a protoplanetary disc around the star (the raw material of planet formation) is too limited to allow a massive enough core to form, and the runaway process to occur.

Yet the existence of TOI-6894b (a giant planet orbiting an extremely low-mass star) suggests this model cannot be completely accurate and alternative theories are needed.

Edward added: ""Given the mass of the planet, TOI-6894b could have formed through an intermediate core-accretion process, in which a protoplanet forms and steadily accretes gas without the core becoming massive enough for runaway gas accretion.

""Alternatively, it could have formed because of a gravitationally unstable disc. In some cases, the disc surrounding the star will become unstable due to the gravitational force it exerts on itself. These discs can then fragment, with the gas and dust collapsing to form a planet.""

But the team found that neither theory could completely explain the formation of TOI-6894b from the available data, which leaves the origin of this giant planet as an open question for now.

Atmospheric Answers 

One avenue to shed light on the mystery of TOI-6894b's formation is a detailed atmospheric analysis. By measuring the distribution of material within the planet, astronomers can determine the size and structure of the planet's core, which can tell us whether TOI-6894b formed via accretion or via an unstable disc.

This is not the only interesting feature of TOI-6894b's atmosphere; it is unusually cold for a gas giant. Most of the gas giants found by exoplanet hunters are hot Jupiters, massive gas giants with temperatures of ~1000-2000 Kelvin. TOI-6894b, by comparison, is just 420 Kelvin. The cool temperature alongside other features of this planet, such as the very deep transits, makes it one of the most promising giant planets for astronomers to characterise with a cool atmosphere.

Professor Amaury Triaud, University of Birmingham, co-author, and member of the SPECULOOS collaboration said: ""Based on the stellar irradiation of TOI-6894b, we expect the atmosphere is dominated by methane chemistry, which is exceedingly rare to identify. Temperatures are low enough that atmospheric observations could even show us ammonia, which would be the first time it is found in an exoplanet atmosphere.

""TOI-6894b likely presents a benchmark exoplanet for the study of methane-dominated atmospheres and the best 'laboratory' to study a planetary atmosphere containing carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen outside the Solar System.""

The atmosphere of TOI-6894b is already scheduled to be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) within the next 12 months. This should allow astronomers to determine which, if either, of the possible theories can explain the formation of this unexpected planet.

Co-author Dr. Andrés Jordán, researcher at the Millennium Institute of Astrophysics and professor at Adolfo Ibáñez University, said: ""This system provides a new challenge for models of planet formation, and it offers a very interesting target for follow-up observations to characterize its atmosphere.

""This discovery is the result of a systematic program we have been carrying out for several years from Chile and the UK. Our efforts have allowed us to contribute significantly to a better understanding of how often small stars can form giant planets, and we are providing prime targets for follow-up with space-based platforms.""

Cells taken from the lungs of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a larger accumulation of soot-like carbon deposits compared to cells taken from people who smoke but do not have COPD, according to a study published today, June 10, in ERJ Open Research. Carbon can enter the lungs via cigarette smoke, diesel exhaust and polluted air.

The cells, called alveolar macrophages, normally protect the body by engulfing any particles or bacteria that reach the lungs. But, in their new study, researchers found that when these cells are exposed to carbon they grow larger and encourage inflammation.

The research was led by Dr James Baker and Dr Simon Lea from the University of Manchester, UK. Dr Baker said: ""COPD is a complex disease that has a number of environmental and genetic risk factors. One factor is exposure to carbon from smoking or breathing polluted air.

""We wanted to study what happens in the lungs of COPD patients when this carbon builds up in alveolar macrophage cells, as this may influence the cells' ability to protect the lungs.""

The researchers used samples of lung tissue from surgery for suspected lung cancer. They studied samples (that did not contain any cancer cells) from 28 people who had COPD and 15 people who were smokers but did not have COPD.

Looking specifically at alveolar macrophage cells under a microscope, the researchers measured the sizes of the cells and the amount of carbon accumulated in the cells.

They found that the average amount of carbon was more than three times greater in alveolar macrophage cells from COPD patients compared to smokers. Cells containing carbon were consistently larger than cells with no visible carbon.

Patients with larger deposits of carbon in their alveolar macrophages had worse lung function, according to a measure called FEV1%, which quantifies how much and how forcefully patients can breathe out.

When the researchers exposed macrophages to carbon particles in the lab, they saw the cells become much larger and found that they were producing higher levels of proteins that lead to inflammation.

Dr Lea said: ""As we compared cells from COPD patients with cells from smokers, we can see that this build-up of carbon is not a direct result of cigarette smoking. Instead, we show alveolar macrophages in COPD patients contain more carbon and are inherently different in terms of their form and function compared to those in smokers.

""Our research raises an interesting question as to the cause of the increased levels of carbon in COPD patients' macrophages. It could be that people with COPD are less able to clear the carbon they breathe in. It could also be that people exposed to more particulate matter are accumulating this carbon and developing COPD as a result.

""In future, it would be interesting to study how this carbon builds up and how lung cells respond over a longer period of time.""

Professor Fabio Ricciardolo is Chair of the European Respiratory Society's group on monitoring airway disease, based at the University of Torino, Italy, and was not involved in the research. He said: ""This set of experiments suggest that people with COPD accumulate unusually large amounts of carbon in the cells of their lungs. This build-up seems to be altering those cells, potentially causing inflammation in the lungs and leading to worse lung function.

""In addition, this research offers some clues about why polluted air might cause or worsen COPD. However, we know that smoking and air pollution are risk factors for COPD and other lung conditions, so we need to reduce levels of pollution in the air we breathe and we need to help people to quit smoking.""

Astrophysicists have gained precious new insights into how distant ""exoplanets"" form and what their atmospheres can look like, after using the James Webb Telescope to image two young exoplanets in extraordinary detail. Among the headline findings were the presence of silicate clouds in one of the planet's atmospheres, and a circumplanetary disk thought to feed material that can form moons around the other.

In broader terms, understanding how the ""YSES-1"" super-solar system formed offers further insight into the origins of our own solar system, and gives us the opportunity to watch and learn as a planet similar to Jupiter forms in real time.

""Directly imaged exoplanets -- planets outside our own Solar System -- are the only exoplanets that we can truly take photos of,"" said Dr Evert Nasedkin, a Postdoctoral Fellow in Trinity College Dublin's School of Physics, who is a co-author of the research article just published in leading international journal, Nature.""These exoplanets are typically still young enough that they are still hot from their formation and it is this warmth, seen in the thermal infrared, that we as astronomers observe.""

Using spectroscopic instruments on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Dr Kielan Hoch and a large international team, including astronomers at Trinity College Dublin, obtained broad spectra of two young, giant exoplanets which orbit a sun-like star, YSES-1. These planets are several times larger than Jupiter, and orbit far from their host star, highlighting the diversity of exoplanet systems even around stars like our own sun.

The main goal of measuring the spectra of these exoplanets was to understand their atmospheres. Different molecules and cloud particles all absorb different wavelengths of light, imparting a characteristic fingerprint onto the emission spectrum from the planets.

Dr Nasedkin said: ""When we looked at the smaller, farther-out companion, known as YSES 1-c, we found the tell-tale signature of silicate clouds in the mid-infrared. Essentially made of sand-like particles, this is the strongest silicate absorption feature observed in an exoplanet yet.""

""We believe this is linked to the relative youth of the planets: younger planets are slightly larger in radius, and this extended atmosphere may allow the cloud to absorb more of the light emitted by the planet. Using detailed modelling, we were able to identify the chemical composition of these clouds, as well as details about the shapes and sizes of the cloud particles.""

The inner planet, YSES-1b offered up other surprises: while the whole planetary system is young, at 16.7 million years old, it is too old to find signs of the planet-forming disk around the host star. But around YSES-1b the team observed a disk around the planet itself, thought to feed material onto the planet and serve as the birthplace of moons - similar to those seen around Jupiter. Only three other such disks have been identified to date, both around objects significantly younger than YSES-1b, raising new questions as to how this disk could be so long-lived.

Dr Nasedkin added: ""Overall, this work highlights the incredible abilities of JWST to characterise exoplanet atmospheres. With only a handful of exoplanets that can be directly imaged, the YSES-1 system offers unique insights into the atmospheric physics and formation processes of these distant giants.""

In broad terms, understanding how this super-solar system formed offers further insight into the origins of our own solar system, giving us an opportunity to watch as a planet similar to Jupiter forms in real time. Understanding how long it takes to form planets, and the chemical makeup at the end of formation is important to learn what the building blocks of our own solar system looked like. Scientists can compare these young systems to our own, which provides hints of how our own planets have changed over time.

Dr Kielan Hoch, Giacconi Fellow at the Space Telescope Science Institute, said: ""This program was proposed before the launch of JWST. It was unique, as we hypothesized that the NIRSpec instrument on the future telescope should be able to observe both planets in its field of view in a single exposure, essentially, giving us two for the price of one. Our simulations ended up being correct post-launch, providing the most detailed dataset of a multi-planet system to-date.""

""The YSES-1 system planets are also too widely separated to be explained through current formation theories, so the additional discoveries of distinct silicate clouds around YSES-1 c and small hot dusty material around YSES-1 b leads to more mysteries and complexities for determining how planets form and evolve.""

""This research was also led by a team of early career researchers such as postdocs and graduate students who make up the first five authors of the paper. This work would not have been possible without their creativity and hard work, which is what aided in making these incredible multidisciplinary discoveries.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists discover natural cancer-fighting sugar in sea cucumbers","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250611084108.htm","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 15:04:17 GMT","

Sea cucumbers are the ocean's janitors, cleaning the seabed and recycling nutrients back into the water. But this humble marine invertebrate could also hold the key to stopping the spread of cancer.

A sugar compound found in sea cucumbers can effectively block Sulf-2, an enzyme that plays a major role in cancer growth, according to a University of Mississippi-led study published in Glycobiology. 

""Marine life produces compounds with unique structures that are often rare or not found in terrestrial vertebrates,"" said Marwa Farrag, a fourth-year doctoral candidate in the UM Department of BioMolecular Sciences.

""And so, the sugar compounds in sea cucumbers are unique. They aren't commonly seen in other organisms. That's why they're worth studying.""

Farrag, a native of Assiut, Egypt, and the study's lead author, worked with a team of researchers from Ole Miss and Georgetown University on the project.

Human cells, and those of most mammals, are covered in tiny, hairlike structures called glycans that help with cell communication, immune responses and the recognition of threats such as pathogens. Cancer cells alter the expression of certain enzymes, including Sulf-2, which in turn modifies the structure of glycans. This modification helps cancer spread.

""The cells in our body are essentially covered in 'forests' of glycans,"" said Vitor Pomin, associate professor of pharmacognosy. ""And enzymes change the function of this forest - essentially prunes the leaves of that forest.

""If we can inhibit that enzyme, theoretically, we are fighting against the spread of cancer.""

Using both computer modeling and laboratory testing, the research team found that the sugar - fucosylated chondroitin sulfate - from the sea cucumber Holothuria floridana can effectively inhibit Sulf-2.

""We were able to compare what we generated experimentally with what the simulation predicted, and they were consistent,"" said Robert Doerksen, professor of medicinal chemistry. ""That gives us more confidence in the results.""

Unlike other Sulf-2 regulating medications, the sea cucumber compound does not interfere with blood clotting, said Joshua Sharp, UM associate professor of pharmacology.

""As you can imagine, if you are treating a patient with a molecule that inhibits blood coagulation, then one of the adverse effects that can be pretty devastating is uncontrolled bleeding,"" he said. ""So, it's very promising that this particular molecule that we're working with doesn't have that effect.""

As a marine-based cancer therapy, the sea cucumber compound may be easier to create and safer to use.

""Some of these drugs we have been using for 100 years, but we're still isolating them from pigs because chemically synthesizing it would be very, very difficult and very expensive,"" Sharp said. ""That's why a natural source is really a preferred way to get at these carbohydrate-based drugs.""

Unlike extracting carbohydrate-based drugs from pigs or other land mammals, extracting the compound from sea cucumbers does not carry a risk of transferring viruses and other harmful agents, Pomin said.

""It's a more beneficial and cleaner resource,"" he said. ""The marine environment has many advantages compared to more traditional sources.""

But sea cucumbers - some variants of which are a culinary delicacy in the Pacific Rim - aren't so readily abundant that scientists could go out and harvest enough to create a line of medication. The next step in the research is to find a way to synthesize the sugar compound for future testing.

""One of the problems in developing this as a drug would be the low yield, because you can't get tons and tons of sea cucumbers,"" Pomin said. ""So, we have to have a chemical route, and when we've developed that, we can begin applying this to animal models.""

The interdisciplinary nature of the scientific study, which featured researchers from chemistry, pharmacognosy and computational biology, underscored the importance of cross-disciplinary collaboration in tackling complex diseases like cancer, Pomin said.

""This research took multiple expertise - mass spectrometry, biochemistry, enzyme inhibition, computation,"" Pomin said. ""It's the effort of the whole team.""

Looking to nature for answers to complex questions can reveal new and unprecedented results that can even affect cells on molecular levels.

For instance, human cells oxidize glucose to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), an energy source necessary for life. Cancer cells produce ATP through glycolysis, which does not utilize oxygen even under conditions where oxygen is present, and convert glucose into pyruvic acid and lactic acid. This method of producing ATP, known as the Warburg effect, is considered inefficient, thus raising questions as to why cancer cells choose this energy pathway to fuel their proliferation and survival.

In search for this energy catalyst, Associate Professor Akiko Kojima-Yuasa's team at Osaka Metropolitan University's Graduate School of Human Life and Ecology analyzed the cinnamic acid ester ethyl p-methoxycinnamate, a main component of kencur ginger, and its mechanism of action. In previous research, the team discovered that ethyl p-methoxycinnamate has inhibitory effects on cancer cells. Furthering their study, the acid ester was administered to Ehrlich ascites tumor cells to assess which component of the cancer cells' energy pathway was being affected.

Results revealed that the acid ester inhibits ATP production by disrupting de novo fatty acid synthesis and lipid metabolism, rather than through glycolysis as commonly theorized. Further, the researchers discovered acid ester-induced inhibition triggered increased glycolysis, which acted as a possible survival mechanism in the cells. This adaptability was theorized to be attributed to ethyl p-methoxycinnamate's inability to induce cell death.

""These findings not only provide new insights that supplement and expand the theory of the Warburg effect, which can be considered the starting point of cancer metabolism research, but are also expected to lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets and the development of new treatment methods,"" stated Professor Kojima-Yuasa.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Clean energy, dirty secrets: Inside the corruption plaguing california's solar market","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250611083736.htm","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 14:36:47 GMT","

Solar power is growing by leaps and bounds in the United States, propelled by climate mitigation policies and carbon-free energy goals -- and California is leading the way as the nation's top producer of solar electricity. A new study in Energy Strategy Reviews has revealed a dark side to the state's breakneck pace for solar investment, deployment, and adoption, taking a first-time look at patterns of public and private sector corruption in the California solar market.

Researchers at the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability (IGS) have identified seven distinct types of corruption abuses and risks in California solar energy. Among them, favoritism in project approvals, including a high-profile incident at the senior ranks of the U.S. Department of the Interior involving an intimate relationship with a solar company lobbyist. To fully realize a just energy transition, the authors call for major solar reforms in California as the U.S. increasingly relies on solar energy to decarbonize its electricity sector.

""It's a wake-up call that the solar industry cannot continue on its current trajectory of bad governance and bad behavior.""

""In this groundbreaking study, we find that efforts to accelerate solar infrastructure deployment in California end up contributing to a sobering array of corruption practices and risks. These include shocking abuses of power in the approval and licensing phases as well as the displacement of Indigenous groups, and also nefarious patterns of tax evasion or the falsification of information about solar projects,"" says lead author Benjamin Sovacool, who is the director of IGS and a Boston University professor of earth and environment. ""It's a wake-up call that the solar industry cannot continue on its current trajectory of bad governance and bad behavior.""

Drawing on a literature review and original interviews and fieldwork, the study's authors arrive at a framework that helps explore the wider socio-political realities driving corruption at a time of explosive growth in the California solar market, from 2010 to 2024. During this period, the state's solar energy production increased exponentially, reaching 79,544 gigawatt hours in 2024, or enough to power approximately 7.4 million U.S. households for a year, according to the State of Renewable Energy dashboard.

The research implicates solar energy in numerous corruption practices and risks that have adversely affected communities, policymaking and regulation, and siting decisions and planning.

""The most eye-opening finding for me is how common corruption is at every level of solar development, from small-scale vendors to high-level government officials, even in a well-regulated, progressive state like California,"" says co-author Alexander Dunlap, an IGS research fellow.

Favoritism and other forms of corruption 

To understand how corruption undermines the solar market, the researchers focused on numerous utility-scale deployments in Riverside County, the fourth most populous county in California. They set out to document patterns of perceived corruption from a broad range of voices, gaining insights through organized focus groups and observation at different solar sites, as well as conducting interviews door-to-door and in a local supermarket parking lot. Respondents included residents in Blythe and Desert Center, California, impacted by solar energy development, solar construction workers, non-governmental organizations, solar company employees, federal agencies, and state and local governments.

While the study's authors acknowledge the difficulty of confirming individual claims of corruption, their mixed-methods research approach combines these personal assertions with analysis of news stories, court testimony, and other official sources to support their findings.

They point to a blend of public, private, social, and political patterns of corruption in the California solar energy market.

A sunnier future? 

Outside of a few headline-making scandals, corruption in California's renewable energy sector has gone largely unexamined, allowing the underlying dynamics at play to erode the potential of a just energy transition. To remedy this, the study's authors recommend corruption risk mapping to document problematic practices and entities, subsidy registers and sunset clauses to deter rent-seeking and tax evasion, transparency initiatives aimed at environmental changes and data production (for Environmental Impact Assessment), strong enforcement of anti-corruption laws, and shared ownership models for solar to improve accountability.

This newly published study, ""Sex for Solar? Examining Patterns of Public and Private Sector Corruption within the Booming California Solar Energy Market,"" is part of a larger IGS research project looking at injustices in U.S. solar and wind energy supply chains.

Metrics details

Eutyrannosaurians were large predatory dinosaurs that dominated Asian and North American terrestrial faunas in latest Cretaceous times. These apex predators arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids during the ‘middle' Cretaceous that are poorly known owing to the paucity of fossil material1,2,3. Here we report on a new tyrannosauroid, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis gen. et sp. nov., from lower Upper Cretaceous deposits of Mongolia that provides a new perspective on eutyrannosaurian origins and evolution. Phylogenetic analyses recover Khankhuuluu immediately outside Eutyrannosauria and recover the massive, deep-snouted Tyrannosaurini and the smaller, gracile, shallow-snouted Alioramini as highly derived eutyrannosaurian sister clades. Khankhuuluu and the late-diverging Alioramini independently share features related to a shallow skull and gracile build with juvenile eutyrannosaurians, reinforcing the key role heterochrony had in eutyrannosaurian evolution. Although eutyrannosaurians were mainly influenced by peramorphosis or accelerated growth4,5,6,7,8,9,10, Alioramini is revealed as a derived lineage that retained immature features through paedomorphosis and is not a more basal lineage as widely accepted11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. Our results reveal that Asian tyrannosauroids (similar to Khankhuuluu) dispersed to North America, giving rise to Eutyrannosauria in the mid-Late Cretaceous. Eutyrannosauria diversified and remained exclusively in North America until a single dispersal to Asia in the latest Cretaceous that established Alioramini and Tyrannosaurini. Stark morphological differences between Alioramini and Tyrannosaurini probably evolved due to divergent heterochronic trends—paedomorphosis versus peramorphosis, respectively—allowing them to coexist in Asia and occupy different ecological niches.

Synapomorphies of Khankhuuluu+Eutyrannosauria or characters restricted to Eutyrannosauria in magenta. Nasals of Khankhuuluu MPC-D 100/50 (1a, 2a) and Gorgosaurus ROM 1247 (1b, 2b) in dorsal (1a, b) and ventral (2a, b) views. Quadratojugals of Khankhuuluu (3a) and Daspletosaurus (3b). Scapulocoracoid of Khankhuuluu MPC-D 100/50 (4a) and Albertosaurus TMP 1986.064.0001 (4b). Quadrates of Khankhuuluu MPC-D 100/50 (5a) and MPC-D 100/51 (6a) and Gorgosaurus TMP 1986.144.0001 (5b and 6b) in lateral (5) and posterior (6) views. Distal tibia of Khankhuuluu MPC-D 100/51 (7a) and Albertosaurus TMP 1986.064.0001 (7b) in anterior view. Scale bars = 5 cm. Abbreviations: aco, astragalar contact orientation changes across angle (unambiguous synapomorphy); edp, expanded dorsal process of quadratojugal; lcp, lacrimal cornual process; mfp, medial frontal process; npr, small nasal pneumatic recess present; nr, nasal rugosities; qf, quadrate foramen; qjc, quadratojugal contact medial margin; qr, quadrate recess; qrwa, quadrate recess aperture medial wall absent; qrwp, quadrate recess aperture medial wall present; sad, deep subacromial depression; sfp, supernumerary frontal processes present medial frontal process absent; sgf, subglenoid fossa ventral face present.

Cladogram with examples of Tyrannosaurinae skulls, including: a, Bistahieversor, b, Daspletosaurus, c, Alioramus (Alioramini), and d, Tyrannosaurus (Tyrannosaurini). Alioramini is supported as both a highly derived member of Tyrannosaurinae and as a sister taxon to the Tyrannosaurini by numerous unambiguous and exclusive synapomorphies. See Supplementary Information 8 for a full list of synapomorphies.

Taxa excluded from the comprehensive analysis depicted in Fig. 3 are Kileskus, Juratyrant, Sinotyrannus, Stokesososaurus, Timurlengia, Alectrosaurus, Dryptosaurus, Nanuqsaurus, Thanatotheristes, and Zhuchengtyrannus. Values adjacent to nodes denote node support values: Bremer supports (left values < 20), bootstrap indices (right values > 50). Bremer support values and bootstrap indices increase significantly for most clades relative to those clades in the comprehensive analysis in Fig. 3. Among derived tyrannosaurine taxa (e.g., Alioramini+Tyrannosaurini), higher node values are found here relative to similar positions in the comprehensive tree in Fig. 3. This reveals that lower overall support values in the comprehensive tree is primarily due to ambiguity incurred in character state transformations with the inclusion of highly fragmentary taxa, particularly in late-diverging tyrannosauroids (e.g., Nanuqsaurus [8.1% of characters scored], Thanatotheristes [19.0%] Zhuchengtyrannus [10.3%]).

Supporting information for main text includes measurements and ontogenetic assessment for Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, supplementary discussions for the phylogenetic position of Alioramini, phylogenetic protocols including taxon and character omissions, character list, clade synapomorphies, Templeton's test results, and additional tests of time calibration.

Metrics details

Developing bioelectronics capable of stably tracking brain-wide, single-cell, millisecond-resolved neural activity in the developing brain is critical for advancing neuroscience and understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. During development, the three-dimensional structure of the vertebrate brain arises from a two-dimensional neural plate1,2. These large morphological changes have previously posed a challenge for implantable bioelectronics to reliably track neural activity throughout brain development3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Here we introduce a tissue-level-soft, submicrometre-thick mesh microelectrode array that integrates into the embryonic neural plate by leveraging the tissue's natural two-dimensional-to-three-dimensional reconfiguration. As organogenesis progresses, the mesh deforms, stretches and distributes throughout the brain, seamlessly integrating with neural tissue. Immunostaining, gene expression analysis and behavioural testing confirm no adverse effects on brain development or function. This embedded electrode array enables long-term, stable mapping of how single-neuron activity and population dynamics emerge and evolve during brain development. In axolotl models, it not only records neural electrical activity during regeneration but also modulates the process through electrical stimulation.

a, Schematics showing the setup for behavioral testing. In each test, a tadpole is placed in a clear tank, sitting on an upward-facing screen. The screen is programmed to display the appropriate stimulation pattern for the color preference, visual avoidance, and edge preference tests. In the color preference test, the screen alternated between displaying half white and half black for 40 s each. In the visual avoidance test, a black dot is directly controllable via a computer mouse. The operator moved the dot toward the tadpole. If the tadpole responded, the operator would proceed to initiate the next encounter. If the tadpole did not respond, the operator would initiate a new encounter after five seconds. In the edge preference test, the entire screen is white. The setup is placed inside a dark box to minimize light contamination. The interior of the box is coated black to minimize reflections from the screen. Tadpoles are recorded using a video camera pointed down on the tank through a hole in the top of the box. b-i, Time-lapse snapshots of a visual avoidance video showing the trajectory process of a behaving tadpole.

Metrics details

Conservation of damaged oil paintings requires manual inpainting of losses1,2, leading to months-long treatments of considerable expense; 70% of paintings in institutional collections are locked away from public view, in part because of treatment cost3,4. Recent advancements in digital image reconstruction have helped to envision treatment results, although without any direct means of achieving them5,6,7,8. Here I describe the physically applied digital restoration of a painting, a highly damaged oil-on-panel attributed to the Master of the Prado Adoration from the late fifteenth century. In parallel, 5,612 losses spanning 66,205 mm2 and 57,314 colours were infilled with a reversible laminate mask comprising a colour-accurate bilayer of printed pigments on polymeric films. To ensure the effectiveness of the restoration, ethical principles in painting conservation were implemented quantitatively for digital mask construction, a critically important foundation lacking in the current digital restoration literature. The infill process took 3.5 h, an estimated 66 times faster than conventional inpainting, and the result closely matched the simulation. This approach grants greatly increased foresight and flexibility to conservators, enabling the restoration of countless damaged paintings deemed unworthy of high conservation budgets.

Four broad types of damage are shown overlayed onto the damaged image of the painting. Three complete panel fissures stem from warping of the wood support boards.

All images are of identical scale and rotated to angularly align with each other. Three infants from other paintings by MPA are shown, with the lower row of images corresponding to 50% opacity overlays on the damaged infant in the painting used in this study. a, The damaged infant in the painting used in this study. b, Infant from the Nativity held by the Birmingham Museums Trust. c, Infant from: Master of the Prado Adoration, Adoration of the Magi, 1460–1470, Oil, Height: 60 cm; Width: 55 cm, (P001558).

a, Cross-sectional diagram of bilayer alignment, showing misaligned white and color ink layers relative to the area of damage. Below are two plots of the damage. Absolute damage solely includes the exposed damage and overfilling. Perceived damage more closely follows the visual effect as seen by a human observer; the sharply contrasting exposed white ink layer is more damaging visually than overfilling. b, Area expansion diagram of layer alignment, showing a circular damaged region and a masking color ink region that is radially expanded. c, Plot of the minimum restorable cross-sectional feature dimension as a function of the combined lateral alignment tolerance and the target restoration effectiveness. In this work, the combined tolerance of 161.2 µm and restoration effectiveness of 1.0 (intersection denoted by star) leads to a calculated minimum restorable dimension of 511 µm. d, Plot of the minimum restorable feature radius as a function of alignment tolerance.

a, Base images are prepared for further processing through brightening, blurring, and coordinate conversion. b, The base mask is constructed through analysis of human-perceived visual differences and identification of features based on contrast with local context. Further processing accounts for tolerance analysis. c, Manual adjustments and final corrections are made to the base mask, which is split for fabrication.

a, General artifacts are initially identified through thresholding perceived differences in value and saturation. b, Following application of tolerance analysis-driven considerations, larger areas end up consolidated with the majority of microscopic regions excluded. c, Contextual features, which are more easily visually perceived owing to their contrast with a uniform background, are separately masked. d, The combined general artifacts and contextual features mask spans most areas that require infilling based on human visual perception. e, Manual additions incorporate large area losses, such as the exposed panel support around the edges of the work, that are not visually significant from an algorithmic standpoint but are identifiable by a human viewer based on broader context. f, The final masking areas overlayed on the damaged painting.

a, Scatter plot of all 57,314 colors used in the infill mask on HSV axes, with log color scale denoting the number of pixels each color is used for. b, Histogram of infill mask colors based on the number of pixels each color is used for. The vast majority of colors represent regions smaller than 10,000 px2 (17.9 mm2). c, Histogram of the number of color variants (i.e., combinations of value and saturation) per hue.

a, The simulated overlay of the digital mask on the image of the damaged painting. b, The physical restoration result, of remarkable similarity to the simulated version.

a, After 2 months of storage, the applied laminate mask can be removed from the painting at the weaker interface of the varnish layer and applied mask, with solvent application assisting in areas with remaining mask fragments. b, A small segment of a fabricated infill mask is placed in a beaker with white spirit. c, After a minute, the infill mask is dissolved.

The physical laminate masking approach and digital mask construction enable the testing of different restorations in a vastly expedited time frame. A physical restoration based on a different infill mask is depicted here. a, The infill mask areas, which were constructed with a lower visually-perceived difference threshold and more aggressively target losses than the final mask used in this work. b, The color infill mask, which was color-adjusted to a higher color value. c, The physical restoration attempt, showing good color matching with the sky and poorer color matching in darker areas of the painting, with infill regions more easily distinguishable as compared to the final restoration in this work.

Metrics details

Lipids are essential components of cancer cells due to their structural and signalling roles1. To meet metabolic demands, many cancers take up extracellular lipids2,3,4,5; however, how these lipids contribute to cancer growth and progression remains poorly understood. Here, using functional genetic screens, we identify uptake of lipoproteins—the primary mechanism for lipid transport in circulation—as a key determinant of ferroptosis sensitivity in cancer. Lipoprotein supplementation robustly inhibits ferroptosis across diverse cancer types, primarily through the delivery of α-tocopherol (α-toc), the most abundant form of vitamin E in human lipoproteins. Mechanistically, cancer cells take up lipoproteins through a pathway dependent on sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) linked to cell-surface proteoglycans. Disrupting GAG biosynthesis or acutely degrading surface GAGs reduces lipoprotein uptake, sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis and impairs tumour growth in mice. Notably, human clear cell renal cell carcinomas—a lipid-rich malignancy—exhibit elevated levels of chondroitin sulfate and increased lipoprotein-derived α-toc compared with normal kidney tissue. Together, our study establishes lipoprotein uptake as a critical anti-ferroptotic mechanism in cancer and implicates GAG biosynthesis as a therapeutic target.

Silicon has enabled advancements in semiconductor technology through miniaturization, but scaling challenges necessitate the exploration of new materials1. Two-dimensional (2D) materials, with their atomic thickness and high carrier mobility, offer a promising alternative2,3,4,5. Although significant progress has been made in wafer-scale growth6,7,8, high-performance field-effect transistors9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 and circuits based on 2D materials21,22,23, achieving complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) integration remains a challenge. Here, we present a 2D one instruction set computer based on CMOS technology, leveraging the heterogeneous integration of large-area n-type MoS2 and p-type WSe2 field-effect transistors. By scaling the channel length, incorporating a high-κ gate dielectric and optimizing material growth and device postprocessing, we tailored the threshold voltages for both n- and p-type 2D field-effect transistors, achieving high drive currents and reduced subthreshold leakage. This enabled circuit operation below 3 V with an operating frequency of up to 25 kHz, which was constrained by parasitic capacitances, along with ultra-low power consumption in the picowatt range and a switching energy as low as approximately 100 pJ. Finally, we projected the performance of the one instruction set computer and benchmarked it against state-of-the-art silicon technology using an industry-standard SPICE-compatible BSIM-BULK model. This model was calibrated with experimental data that incorporate device-to-device variations. Although further advances are needed, this work marks a significant milestone in the application of 2D materials to microelectronics.

Metrics details

Preventing gender disparities in mathematics is a worldwide preoccupation1,2. In infancy and early childhood, boys and girls exhibit similar core knowledge of number and space3,4,5,6,7,8. Gender disparities in maths are, therefore, thought to primarily reflect an internalization of the sociocultural stereotype that ‘girls are bad at maths'. However, where, when and how widely this stereotype becomes entrenched remains uncertain. Here, we report the results of a 4-year longitudinal assessment of language and mathematical performance of all French first and second graders (2,653,082 children). Boys and girls exhibited very similar maths scores upon school entry, but a gender gap in favour of boys became highly significant after 4 months of schooling and reached an effect size of about 0.20 after 1 year. These findings were repeated each year and varied only slightly across family, class or school type and socio-economic level. Although schooling correlated with age, exploiting the near-orthogonal variations indicated that the gender gap increased with schooling rather than with age. These findings point to the first year of school as the time and place where a maths gender gap emerges in favour of boys, thus helping focus the search for solutions and interventions.

The original data were collected on a national scale and centralized by the DEPP team at the Ministry of Education in France. A formal agreement was established between our research laboratory and DEPP to enable our local use of and access to the data. We used the software R v.4.3.2, which can be found at the following link: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/. Given that the data adhered to the GDPR European law on data protection, extraction of data from the DEPP structure was not permitted. For confidentiality, the raw data are not shared in public but are made accessible through a data security convention established with DEPP in France. We shared a simulated dataset to gain an initial understanding of how the data were organized and how the data management was structured.

For reproducibility, the code and models that were used to generate the results, text, figures and tables both in the main text and in the Supplementary Information are publicly available on the GitHub repository https://github.com/PauMdlm/Gendergaps.

A) Math scores as a function of age in 2018 (main figure), 2019, 2020 and 2021. Mean math levels (in z-score) are presented within the national population, in function of age in month, at T1, T2 and T3. For children within the typical age range (light blue), the yearly data was precise enough to detect a strictly monotonic effect of age in months at each period. For advanced-in-age children (dark blue) or late-in-age (green), a large and increasing learning gap is detected. Bars, indicating one standard error, are often too small to be visible. (B) Math scores as a function of school categories and SES scores in 2018 (main figure), 2019, 2020 and 2021. Mean math levels (in z-score) are presented within the national population, in function of 10 school subcategories, defined as follow: for each of four main school categories (i.e., private, regular, priority education [PE], and higher-priority education [HPE] public schools), a median or a quartile split (for regular public schools only) was implemented based on the subgroup average socio-economic status (SES). The highest SES score stands on the left and the lowest SES score on the right of the x-axis, for a total of 10 school subcategories: 2 median-split for private schools (in blue), 4 quarter-split for regular public schools (in green), and 2 median-splits for PE (in orange) and for HPE public (in red) schools. Disparities at the start of 1st grade remained present at subsequent time points, apart from PE and HPE schools whose gap decreased during schooling (T2) and increased again after the summer break (T3). C) Language scores as a function of age in 2018 (main figure), 2019, 2020 and 2021. D) Language scores as a function of school categories and SES scores in 2018 (main figure), 2019, 2020 and 2021.

Performance of boys (blue) and girls (red) in z-score in (A) problem-solving and (B) number-line assessments. Within each school category, the gender gap was almost null or small at school start (T1), detectable after 4 months (T2), and large after one year of schooling (T3), except for higher SES score school categories, where the gender gap was already in favor of boys. Gender gaps effects on (C) problem-solving and (D) number line, as measured by Cohen's d in function of age. Bars, indicating one standard error, are too small to be visible (n = 2,653,082 children).

Data from 20 subtests (i.e., calculus, addition, subtraction, writing numbers, reading numbers, comparing quantities, number line and problem solving) at T1, T2 or T3 and from the four consecutive cohorts. Math gender gaps could not be attributed solely to an increase in test difficulty as the average difference in gender gap within a given type of subtest between T1 and T3 moves from 0.194 SD without the test difficulty variable to 0.179 SD when controlling for test difficulty (see SI Table S7).

(A) Density over classrooms of the average math gender gap, expressed as the difference in average z score between boys and girls (for classes with at least 30% of boys and 30% of girls, n = 2,455,483). The distribution was centered on zero at T1, but a majority of classrooms showed a gender gap at T2 and especially at T3. Results were similar for 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. (B) Math gender gap as a function of class size, class initial level in math, class heterogeneity of level in math, and boys-girls ratio per class (in Cohen's d). A higher heterogeneity of level in math was associated with a lower gender gap in favor of boys whereas a larger class size (in 2018 and 2019) and higher-class level in math were associated with a higher gender gap in favor of boys. Boy/girl ratio per class did not have much effect on gender gaps in math. Bars, indicating one standard error, are too small to be visible. (C) Math gender gap and the role model effect in math (in Cohen's d). Having a girl or a boy as the first of class in math at T1 had a small effect on the gender gap, measured in Cohen's d. For this analysis, data from the best student(s) at T1 in math were excluded. Classes with girls as first of class in math developed a slightly smaller gender gap in favor of boys.

Girls were already ahead of boys at T1 (in z score), an effect that widened with age and was only transiently reduced during the school year (T2), but largely restored after the school break (T3). Results were replicated in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. No significant variations in language gender gap were noted when comparing Covid years to 2018 and 2021.

Math gender gaps, measured as Cohen's d, were analyzed as a function of (A) the mother's profession and (B) the father's profession. Such data was only available for the 2018–2019 cohort, as they were registered upon entering 6th grade in 2023. A widening math gender gap was observed in children, regardless of their parents' professions. Figure adapted with permission from ref. 51, HAL.

Boys and girls of typical age (69 to 80 months) were paired on their math scores at T1, SES, age, language at T1 and school category (see SI Table S14). (A) Results from the 2018 cohort. Even when T1 differences were eliminated by this matching procedure, a gender gap emerged at T2 and widened at T3, in line with a cumulative influence of school exposure. (B) Prior to matching, the gray points indicate that there were small differences between boys and girls, either positive or negative depending on the specific test, which vanished after matching (orange dots). (C) Results from the 2019, 2020 and 2021 cohorts, same format as panel A. Note that in the matched pairs, children are no longer representative of the national sample (dotted line). While this difference is notable, it is irrelevant to the main point of this analysis, which is to show that boys and girls can be very similar at T1, and still diverge in math at T2 and T3.

Metrics details

The unpredictability of random numbers is fundamental to both digital security1,2 and applications that fairly distribute resources3,4. However, existing random number generators have limitations—the generation processes cannot be fully traced, audited and certified to be unpredictable. The algorithmic steps used in pseudorandom number generators5 are auditable, but they cannot guarantee that their outputs were a priori unpredictable given knowledge of the initial seed. Device-independent quantum random number generators6,7,8,9 can ensure that the source of randomness was unknown beforehand, but the steps used to extract the randomness are vulnerable to tampering. Here we demonstrate a fully traceable random number generation protocol based on device-independent techniques. Our protocol extracts randomness from unpredictable non-local quantum correlations, and uses distributed intertwined hash chains to cryptographically trace and verify the extraction process. This protocol forms the basis for a public traceable and certifiable quantum randomness beacon that we have launched10. Over the first 40 days of operation, we completed the protocol 7,434 out of 7,454 attempts—a success rate of 99.7%. Each time the protocol succeeded, the beacon emitted a pulse of 512 bits of traceable randomness. The bits are certified to be uniform with error multiplied by actual success probability bounded by 2−64. The generation of certifiable and traceable randomness represents a public service that operates with an entanglement-derived advantage over comparable classical approaches.

In a $30 million mansion perched on a cliff overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge, a group of AI researchers, philosophers, and technologists gathered to discuss the end of humanity.

The Sunday afternoon symposium, called “Worthy Successor,” revolved around a provocative idea from entrepreneur Daniel Faggella: The “moral aim” of advanced AI should be to create a form of intelligence so powerful and wise that “you would gladly prefer that it (not humanity) determine the future path of life itself.”

Faggella made the theme clear in his invitation. “This event is very much focused on posthuman transition,” he wrote to me via X DMs. “Not on AGI that eternally serves as a tool for humanity.”

A party filled with futuristic fantasies, where attendees discuss the end of humanity as a logistics problem rather than a metaphorical one, could be described as niche. If you live in San Francisco and work in AI, then this is a typical Sunday.

About 100 guests nursed nonalcoholic cocktails and nibbled on cheese plates near floor-to-ceiling windows facing the Pacific ocean before gathering to hear three talks on the future of intelligence. One attendee sported a shirt that said “Kurzweil was right,” seemingly a reference to Ray Kurzweil, the futurist who predicted machines will surpass human intelligence in the coming years. Another wore a shirt that said “does this help us get to safe AGI?” accompanied by a thinking face emoji.

Faggella told WIRED that he threw this event because “the big labs, the people that know that AGI is likely to end humanity, don't talk about it because the incentives don't permit it” and referenced early comments from tech leaders like Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and Demis Hassabis, who “were all pretty frank about the possibility of AGI killing us all.” Now that the incentives are to compete, he says, “they're all racing full bore to build it.” (To be fair, Musk still talks about the risks associated with advanced AI, though this hasn't stopped him from racing ahead).

On LinkedIn, Faggella boasted a star-studded guest list, with AI founders, researchers from all the top Western AI labs, and “most of the important philosophical thinkers on AGI.”

The first speaker, Ginevera Davis, a writer based in New York, warned that human values might be impossible to translate to AI. Machines may never understand what it's like to be conscious, she said, and trying to hard-code human preferences into future systems may be shortsighted. Instead, she proposed a lofty-sounding idea called “cosmic alignment”—building AI that can seek out deeper, more universal values we haven't yet discovered. Her slides often showed a seemingly AI-generated image of a techno-utopia, with a group of humans gathered on a grass knoll overlooking a futuristic city in the distance.

Critics of machine consciousness will say that large language models are simply stochastic parrots—a metaphor coined by a group of researchers, some of whom worked at Google, who wrote in a famous paper that LLMs do not actually understand language and are only probabilistic machines. But that debate wasn't part of the symposium, where speakers took as a given the idea that superintelligence is coming, and fast.

By the second talk, the room was fully engaged. Attendees sat cross-legged on the wood floor, scribbling notes. A philosopher named Michael Edward Johnson took the mic and argued that we all have an intuition that radical technological change is imminent, but we lack a principled framework for dealing with the shift—especially as it relates to human values. He said that if consciousness is “the home of value,” then building AI without fully understanding consciousness is a dangerous gamble. We risk either enslaving something that can suffer or trusting something that can't. (This idea relies on a similar premise to machine consciousness and is also hotly debated.) Rather than forcing AI to follow human commands forever, he proposed a more ambitious goal: teaching both humans and our machines to pursue “the good.” (He didn't share a precise definition of what “the good” is, but he insists it isn't mystical and hopes it can be defined scientifically.)

Entrepreneur and speaker Daniel Faggella

Finally, Faggella took the stage. He believes humanity won't last forever in its current form and that we have a responsibility to design a successor, not just one that survives but one that can create new kinds of meaning and value. He pointed to two traits this successor must have: consciousness and “autopoiesis,” the ability to evolve and generate new experiences. Citing philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche, he argued that most value in the universe is still undiscovered and that our job is not to cling to the old but to build something capable of uncovering what comes next.

This, he said, is the heart of what he calls “axiological cosmism,” a worldview where the purpose of intelligence is to expand the space of what's possible and valuable rather than merely serve human needs. He warned that the AGI race today is reckless and that humanity may not be ready for what it's building. But if we do it right, he said, AI won't just inherit the Earth—it might inherit the universe's potential for meaning itself.

During a break between panels and the Q&A, clusters of guests debated topics like the AI race between the US and China. I chatted with the CEO of an AI startup who argued that, of course, there are other forms of intelligence in the galaxy. Whatever we're building here is trivial compared to what must already exist beyond the Milky Way.

At the end of the event, some guests poured out of the mansion and into Ubers and Waymos, while many stuck around to continue talking. ""This is not an advocacy group for the destruction of man,” Faggella told me. “This is an advocacy group for the slowing down of AI progress, if anything, to make sure we're going in the right direction.”

We haven't been excited about recent MacOS updates, but with MacOS 26 Tahoe, it looks like we'll be getting one of the biggest overhauls in a while.

Between the visual redesign and some exciting pro features, there's something for everyone in MacOS 26 Tahoe, including one that Mac nerds will absolutely love.

Also be sure to check out the full rundown of everything Apple announced at WWDC 2025.

It's been a while since Apple has introduced a visual revamp quite this broad. Liquid Glass is what Apple calls the visual motif of its next era in software design.

Marked by soft transparency and subtle gradients, the glass-like design appears in just about every interface, including the Menu Bar, the Lock Screen, app icons, and sidebars in apps. From what I've seen so far, it's a nice change, though some designers have concerns about how it might interfere with basic functionality. The aesthetic changes to macOS haven't been as drastic as what iOS has been through, but this appears to be a well-appreciated fresh coat of paint.

There's a few smaller design changes, such as the ability to change the color of folders or add an emoji to them. Control Center, located up top in the Menu Bar, has also been made completely transparent. More importantly, Apple has added tons more customization so you can add more quick settings to change. You can even add specific settings in commonly used apps such as Zoom.

MacOS Tahoe also brings over a design tweak that came to iPhones last year: tint for icons, which applies a unified look to all your icons at once. Honestly, I'm surprised this is coming to MacOS, because it wasn't well received by reviewers.

This is the feature I'm most excited about. The Spotlight search tool has always been one of my favorite features in MacOS, and I've been waiting for Apple to take this popular feature to the next level. It's smarter on just about every level, quickly offering up apps, documents, or even your clipboard history. But this update is far more than that.

First off, Spotlight can now perform system actions and even in-app actions, such as playing a podcast or starting a recording. You can even fill out parameters such as who you're sending an email to—again, right in Spotlight!

Spotlight gets greatly enhanced in Tahoe.

Hundreds of actions can now be triggered from Spotlight, like sending an email, creating a note, or playing a podcast.

But wait, there's more. There are even Quick Keys you can use to speed things up further. Type “sm” to send a message or “ar” to create a reminder. Think next-level key commands with these. You can set up your own Quick Keys too, really expanding the capabilities and customization. For example, you can set up Quick Keys to take actions within an app that you're using, letting you quickly set up a task all from the keyboard. It's for the Mac nerds out there who are already know every other key command, and I can't wait to try it out.

Shortcuts can be a really powerful way of automating tasks on your Mac. With MacOS Tahoe, these get upgraded by Apple Intelligence, letting you set up shortcuts like summarizing text or generating images. You can even tap into ChatGPT (or the on-device Neural Engine) if necessary, setting up chains of actions that could potentially be extremely useful. For example, you might create a Shortcut that compares notes from text in Notes from a lecture to an audio transcription, and then summarize the differences using Apple Intelligence.

The new actions in Shortcuts.

Bonus points—you can now access these AI-powered shortcuts through the aforementioned Spotlight update.

This one was a bit of a surprise. As part of its ever-growing suite of Continuity features, the Phone app is now coming to Macs. Why put a Phone app on a device that doesn't have a cellular modem? It doesn't make a lot of sense on the surface, but remember, you can intake calls from your iPhone directly to your Mac.

With the app will come all the same newly announced features on iOS 26, such as live translation in calls, new backgrounds for contacts, and automatically screened calls. Not surprisingly, all the changes to group chats will also be coming to the Mac Messages app.

I do think the inclusion of the Phone app could point us in the direction of 5G MacBooks in the future, something Apple has resisted for a long time. While cellular laptops aren't exactly common these days, it certainly feels more possible now that the Phone app is here. So who knows? Maybe the M6 MacBook Pros due out later this year will have a surprise option for cellular connectivity to better make use of the Phone app.

Live Activities from an iPhone will appear in the Mac's menu bar.

Apple is also introducing Live Activities to the Mac, which will hand off an ongoing task from your iPhone, such as an Uber Eats order, and give you updates right in the Menu Bar on your Mac.

There were a couple other features worth mentioning. One is improvements to gaming, with a dedicated Games app, similar to what will be in iPadOS 26 and iOS 26. It's perhaps the most useful here on the Mac, though, since the question of which games are available on Mac often comes up. It also allows Apple to highlight some of the bigger games coming, such as Cyberpunk 2077.

The new Apple Games app.

The more exciting part is the new Game Overlay, something that PC gamers usually have access to. The overlay let's you chat with friends, adjust settings, and more without having to exit the game.

Game Overlay lets players adjust their settings, chat, or invite new players.

Some smaller changes include the ability to capture audio recordings within the Notes app, the Journal app coming to the Mac for the first time, and a new Magnifier feature that zooms in with your connected webcam or camera. As per usual, many of the smaller changes will be discovered later in the release, and some new features may pop up along the way.

The public beta for macOS Tahoe will be available starting in July, with the official release expected in the fall of 2025.

The developer beta release, meanwhile, was launched the day of the announcement, and you don't have to be a developer to install it. We don't typically recommend installing developer betas, as they can be quite buggy, but for the adventurous, you can find the developer beta under Software Update in System Settings by clicking on the “i” icon next to Beta Updates. So long as you have a compatible Mac, you can install it and play around. Just be sure to back up all of your data first.

If you have a recent Mac, even as old as a 2020 M1 MacBook Air, you'll be able to download and install MacOS Tahoe as a free upgrade when it's released later this year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Shot by His Father and Left Blind—Now He's a Hardcore Gamer","https://www.wired.com/story/ross-minor-the-blind-leading-the-gamers/","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

I've never been to Ross Minor's apartment, so when I first arrive, I'm not sure I've got the right place. I look again at the text he sent me a couple of minutes ago. The apartment number and address seem right, but when I peer through the window, all the lights are off, and—

I immediately feel stupid. I knock.

Within moments, I hear someone coming down the stairs. Minor greets me at the door with a firm handshake. I step inside, but I don't go past the entrance, because it's too dark to see anything. “Everyone tells me the lighting in here sucks,” Minor says, apologetically. “Hold on.” He disappears down the hallway and I hear a click. “How's this?” I can see his face now. Square jaw. Meticulously trimmed mustache. Blond hair. Friendly blue eyes, though they aren't focused on me.

I'm here to talk to Minor about his unusual career trajectory (do you know any other world-class swimmers who left the sport to go make video games?), but he doesn't want to stay in his apartment. He wants to go get pizza, and there's a spot nearby he's never been to. “The reviews look great,” he assures me. We walk out the door, and he leads the way: left at the grocery store, right at the corner, another right at the wine bar. A woman waiting at a crosswalk looks at Minor, then at his white cane, and stares for a moment, before shouting past me, over the noise of the traffic, in a tone she probably intends to sound encouraging: “You sure are brave to cross this intersection like that.”

“What other choice do I have?” Minor replies, and smiles. The woman doesn't answer. She looks away. Minor is still smiling.

Ross Minor wasn't born blind. One night in 2006, as he and his older brother slept in their bedroom, his father, angry after being threatened with a divorce, walked in and shot Minor and his brother in the head. Then he turned the gun on himself. Minor woke up in the hospital, where he was told that his brother and father were both dead. Minor couldn't see the person who told him this.

The bullet had passed through Minor's right temple and out the other side of his head, lodging itself in the palm of his hand. On its way, it destroyed his left eye and cut the nerve of his right, leaving him completely blind. He had just celebrated his eighth birthday.

Minor, who is now 27, probably tells some version of this story a couple times a week. (He often warns people beforehand that it's upsetting.) It's also on his website, which is linked in his many social accounts. He knows people are curious, and he doesn't mind answering their questions. How do you read online reviews? A screen reader. How do you get around? A cane, and sometimes a guide dog. Can you really play video games? Yes. Sometimes. Depends on the game.

In fact, Minor has not only figured out how to play (certain) video games. He's trying to build a career with a singular goal: to make it so blind people can play any game they want.

To the outsider, this sounds nonsensical. The “video” part of “video game” comes from the Latin for “see.” Isn't it a bit unreasonable, expecting such a visual medium to be made blind-accessible? But Minor is making progress. He's even becoming something of a celebrity in his field, with some impressive credits to his name: He consulted on Rare's Sea of Thieves and the Xbox game As Dusk Falls, narrated the audio description track for Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender, and is now working on a number of titles from well-known studios whose names I can't print, due to nondisclosure agreements. Because of people like him, and a handful of sympathetic allies in the industry, there are now more options for blind gamers than ever.

Minor devotes most of his time to this work, something that not every blind or disabled person would be able to do. As Minor puts it, he is in a “privileged position”: Back when he was shot by his father, people weren't quite as desensitized to gun violence, he says, and news about family-annihilation cases wasn't so routine. People cared more. Local fundraising efforts established a college fund for him, with a small amount for emergencies.

Still, he struggles. Being disabled is expensive, and even with his various odd jobs in the video game industry, Minor still relies on survivor benefits, Social Security, and food stamps. In other words, he can barely afford to do this work at all. But he insists that he's lucky to be able to try.

At the pizza place, Minor asks me to read the menu for him. If I wasn't here, he'd have used an app on his phone that scans text and reads it aloud. It'd probably be faster that way—I've heard Minor use the app at other times, and he cranks the speed up so high that my ears only hear a spiky torrent of consonants. He'd have “seen” the whole menu by the time I finished dictating the appetizer section. It later occurs to me that sometimes when Minor asks a sighted person for help, it might actually be for our sake: to let us feel useful and included.

One of the first things you'll notice about Minor is a massive blue Gyarados tattoo on his right arm. It holds a few layers of meaning. Visually, a powerful water beast with wings makes sense for a swimmer. Minor picked up swimming during middle school, and he ended up being so good at it he earned a spot on the US Paralympic team. (When I first met him, in 2020, he was training for the Tokyo Olympics—a trip that never happened because he dropped out after what he describes as a long period of depression.)

But the tattoo's bigger meaning is more straightforward: Gyarados is a Pokémon, and the Pokémon video games changed Minor's life. It began in the hospital, as he recovered. “I still don't remember the specific day,” he says, setting down a slice of pizza. “It very much feels like a dream. But I remember one of my friends would visit me from school, and I just wanted to talk to him about Pokémon. So he would play his game for me next to the bed, and I would listen, and I realized that sometimes I could tell what was going on.”

Pokémon was probably not designed to be blind-friendly. Instead, it's what might be called “accidentally accessible.” Each Pokémon has a completely unique cry, a noise it makes when it's summoned for battle. Bird-type Pokémon might have light and airy chiptune glissandos, while heavier rock-type ones tend more toward bass-heavy beeps and booms. Minor had already sunk hours into his own copy of Pokémon Ruby, so he recognized some of the cries from memory.

When Minor left the hospital, he and his mother moved into his grandparents' home. “My mom brought over all my belongings and Ruby,” he says. At first, he had a cousin play for him, and he would listen and explain what to do. Then he asked for the game. He wanted to try for himself.

This is where the most important part of Pokémon's accidental accessibility comes in: the bumps. When walking around in the overworld map, if your character runs into a wall, it makes a characteristic bump sound. Anyone who's ever played the game probably heard the noise just now in their head. It's simple, but it meant that Minor could walk around in the game, navigating by “feel.” Push up three times: nothing, nothing, bump. Hm. Push right: bump. Push left: bump. OK, this is a dead end. Turn around.

For a while after the shooting, Minor was afraid of adults. He would only talk to other children or his mother. Then, around the time Minor was relearning to play Pokémon, an elderly tutor came to visit him. “He gave me my first cane, but I wouldn't even come out from under a blanket to say hi to him,” Minor says. “So he put the cane under the blanket so I could feel it. He was the one who showed me how to use it.”

Next came the lessons. Once a week, the tutor would pull Minor out of class and they'd do an activity. One of his favorites was the clock game. The tutor would hide a wind-up clock somewhere, and Minor would have to find it by listening to the soft ticking. Minor learned to navigate new spaces by exploring them, gently bumping into walls and making mental maps. The experience felt familiar. Almost like Pokémon.

Then an odd thing happened: The real world got easier to navigate, but the worlds of video games did not. When in-game dialog boxes appeared, Minor would have to ask friends on the playground to read him the words. (Kids aren't jaded yet, Minor observes now. They don't mind.) Often, Minor found himself being talked about as an “inspiration”—for overcoming a tragic event, for playing sports, for playing guitar. But all Minor really wanted to talk about, then as now, were video games. And most of the games his friends were raving about were, for him, completely unplayable. Even Pokémon got harder, as later iterations transitioned from grid-based 2D views to three dimensions.

Every so often, though, there were exceptions. “What really opened my eyes to what gaming could be was Left 4 Dead 2,” Minor says. He still remembers the day: on a friend's couch in high school, playing the “Dark Carnival” level. Usually, his friends spent the game protecting him, but this level proved to be too much for them. Zombies swarmed the arena. So Minor began listening for enemies and swinging his melee weapon. After an intense few minutes, he heard the sound of the level ending. “My friends were like, ‘Holy shit, Ross! You saved us!'”

“Dude, I loved that game,” he tells me. “I don't want anyone's pity. But, like, because of how inaccessible the world is, I'm always asking for help. So to actually help others, instead of being the one needing them—like, that's a really, really cool feeling.”

In his early teens, Minor stumbled across an online forum for blind gamers. Before this, Minor would buy a game like one buys a lottery ticket, with the odds he'd be able to play it only slightly better. But here was a community—comparing notes, sharing workarounds, or just venting. Minor told every friend he could, though he assumed sighted gamers wouldn't care. He'd tried writing emails to his favorite game studios, asking them to add features, volunteering to help them playtest. Occasionally he would get a courtesy email back: We'll think about it. “Other times,” Minor says, “I pour my heart out, and then I'd get an automated response.”

Then, in his senior year of high school, Minor posted to the Ask Me Anything subreddit, offering to talk about how he navigated life as a blind person. He expected people to be interested in how he played sports. To his surprise, more people seemed fascinated by the fact that he'd learned to play, yes, video games. At the request of multiple commenters, he managed to post a recording of himself playing Mortal Kombat X. Someone then offered to raise money for Minor to buy an Xbox One so he could stream online. He accepted.

Thus Minor's YouTube channel was born, with a dual purpose: on the one hand, to offer tips for other blind gamers on how to navigate games; on the other, to be a public advocate for blind-accessible games. His following started to grow. (His YouTube channel now has more than 33,000 subscribers.) Perhaps because of this, developers started asking Minor to advise them on making their games more accessible. Minor realized that his lived experience might not be enough. He needed to know more about the craft. He bought books on game design and devoured them. He got every certificate he could think of. He found mentors who had been in the accessibility world longer than he had and asked for advice. He taught himself to program.

This was around the time Minor qualified for the Paralympics. I ask if he ever thought about using that as a platform. Go get a medal and then advocate for his gaming hobby? People listen to athletes. Minor shakes his head. “It's still not equal for us,” he says. “The Paralympics happens a month after the Olympics. And after the Olympics is over, nobody cares.” He adds: “Reach is what I care about. Reach is what matters.”

But more importantly, Minor wasn't passionate about swimming. He was passionate about video games. And to hear Minor tell it, getting people to care about blind-accessible video games is a harder and more complicated task than Olympic-level swimming.

Most modern video games are built atop existing “engines”—a set of tools that provide basic gameplay mechanics. If you want to make a first-person shooter, you don't have to code your shooter's gait or the concept of “gravity” from scratch. Everything from Fortnite to Pokémon Go runs on these engines, and they formed the base tech for around 90 percent of the games released on Steam in 2024.

In theory, these engines could include built-in components for blind gamers: automatic screen-reader integrations, sonar-like environment-sensing toolkits. But there are no real industry standards for such features. As it stands, the handful of games that are truly blind-accessible—like The Last of Us 2, considered at the time of its release the gold standard—are built fully in-house, with proprietary engines; and there is no financial incentive to share designs with other companies.

So, how do you disrupt decades of industry inertia? A lot of patience, Minor says. He observes how other disability activists have done it for generations before him: You smile a lot and explain the same thing over and over and over again.

Minor's first “job” was on Madden NFL 18—he gave his feedback on a controller rumble feature and led a workshop. His name isn't in the credits, and he received no money, only a tour of the offices and a signed copy of the game. (The devs did ask him to do more consulting work, but he passed the gig to a friend; Minor doesn't care for football.) Though things have improved a bit, this isn't unusual for the industry. Game studios often dangle “consulting” gigs at disabled gamers, only to sit them down with a controller, ask them questions for an hour, and then send them on their way with a gift card. Minor says he was once asked by a AAA game studio to travel across town to their offices to playtest a game—but the payment offered was so low that it wouldn't even cover the Uber ride.

It's a delicate dance. Minor, as well as other disability advocates I've spoken to—whether for blind or low-vision gamers, those with mobility or cognitive disabilities, or others—are sometimes hesitant to call out studios they've had bad experiences with. “There's a sense that you shouldn't bite the hand that feeds you,” Minor says. The concern, in other words, is that if disabled people are seen as being “ungrateful” for what they've been “given,” companies will simply turn their backs on them.

Beyond that, it's not enough to simply be good at a consulting job. To keep convincing game studios that accessibility is a worthwhile investment, one also has to be an “advocate,” and this means being a public figure. Or, in more relevant terms, an influencer.

This tricky landscape was something that one of Minor's mentors was an expert at navigating. Brandon Cole, better known online as Superblindman, was one of the industry's best-known blind accessibility consultants. He made a name for himself by being not only relentlessly friendly and optimistic but also phenomenal at his job. When Xbox announced that its flagship racing game Forza Motorsport would be fully playable by blind gamers, nobody was surprised that Cole had been involved. Cole also worked on The Last of Us 2. He posted regularly on social media, spoke at events, and streamed on Twitch, all in the service of bringing awareness to the cause.

Cole died of cancer in 2024. Minor, like most of the community, was gutted. He had lost someone he considered a friend and mentor. He also knew that he would be expected to step up and help continue the work that Cole left behind.

Did I mention that Minor is funny? I know it's a bit of a cliché to say this about a disabled person, but please indulge me here: Ross Minor is absolutely hilarious. As we walk home from the pizza spot, talking excitedly, I duck under a tree branch. Minor … doesn't. He smacks right into it. I feel terrible: I should have warned him. He shakes his head. “Only thing worse than being a blind guy,” he says, spitting out an actual leaf, “is being a six-foot-two blind guy.” My favorite kind of joke: the sharp, uncomfortable kind that hinges on an experience your audience will never understand. The kind I occasionally tell in front of my white friends to watch them squirm, unsure if they're allowed to laugh with me. I look at Minor: He's giving me the same grin he gave the lady at the crosswalk. I finally break down and laugh. Ross, you motherfucker.

Minor moved to Los Angeles three years ago, from Colorado, thinking it might help his career. And it has—up to a point. “Things have started to pick up for me when it comes to consulting and different gigs,” he says. “I feel like I'm really getting traction.” But because so much of his success is tied to his YouTube channel, other problems arise. “Video editing is not accessible,” he says. “Creating thumbnails—you know, they say that's the hook, right?—that stuff's not accessible.”

Then there's the pressure to go viral. Recently, Minor uploaded a video of himself beating a boss in God of War: Ragnarok. It's pretty impressive: a professionally edited split screen with footage of his gameplay, combined with his voiceover explaining how the sound cues work. After a play-by-play of his finishing move, he speaks into the camera: “Gameplay is for everyone, and now you see.”

The video flopped. “Not even a thousand views,” Minor says. “Meanwhile, I post a video about how I go down an escalator with my guide dog: 10,000 views.” He laughs, but he's obviously frustrated. “Like, yeah, it gives people the warm fuzzies, like, ‘Oh, wow, he's so inspirational.' But that's not the point.”

We're back at Minor's house now, where he's showing me his computer setup. Minor streams on Twitch regularly; he only took a break from streaming in January when the Los Angeles fires threatened his apartment. (He didn't realize how close the fires were until someone told him—the bullet that took his vision also took out olfactory nerves, so he couldn't smell the smoke.) He gestures toward his desk. He's got a nice DSLR camera perched on a tripod, a ring light, a microphone. “A lot of this was given to me by the MrBeast foundation,” he says, referring to the nonprofit Beast Philanthropy, founded by its namesake, the famous YouTuber occasionally criticized for videos some people find exploitative. Minor admits he feels a little conflicted about getting such expensive items for free, but he's also realistic. “It's given me a lot of opportunities,” he says, “especially with my audio description work.”

Minor does everything he can to make his Twitch streams look good for his sighted viewers. He sets up multicolored lights in the background, and he pays a small monthly fee for a service that makes them interactive—people in the Twitch chat can change the colors with a text command. Then there's the “Dixie Cam,” an auxiliary camera pointed at his guide dog, Dixie. She's a friendly black lab who seems to think of Minor's streams as an opportunity to catch up on sleep.

Minor occasionally even coordinates his outfits so that they stand out against the background. “I'm just checking to see what color my shirt is today,” he says. “I think it's white.” He points his phone camera at himself, and a rapid-fire voice shouts a description into his ear. “Oh, it's black. Well, there you go,” he shrugs, and chuckles.

Today, he's playing two games, The Last of Us 2 and God of War: Ragnorok. Midway through the first, as his character crawls through an abandoned storefront, Minor starts to answer messages from the chat. “What are the best games for PS5 for blind people?” he reads. He's gotten this one before, but he answers it anyway. “Obviously the Last of Us games—wait, is this a rifle?” A pause while he listens to the screen reader. “Aw yeah.” He picks up the weapon, and as he does so, he hears the groan of a zombie in the distance. He stands up and headshots the enemy from across the room. He goes back to responding to the chat: “ … then Spider-Man 2. Also As Dusk Falls. That's both an accessible game and I advised on that.” He also shouts out God of War: Ragnarok, but with a caveat: “If you have a sighted person around occasionally, that would go a long way.”

He's not kidding. Half an hour after switching over to God of War, he gets stuck. Minor had been absolutely plowing through the game, using sound cues to mow down enemies, jump over obstacles, dodge projectiles. But now his session has come to an abrupt halt. “Hey guys,” he says, talking to the handful of people in the chat. “Uh … did my computer freeze?”

It did not. His character is simply dangling from a ledge, and there is no sound to indicate what is going on. Minor has come up against the only foe he can't beat: silence. Without a cue to let him know he can safely drop down, he's stuck.

In that moment, I think about another game, Sea of Thieves, in which teams form pirate crews and rove around in the ocean. It seems like it would be unplayable for a blind person. And for the person steering the boat, it largely was, because the sea is full of randomly placed rocks. Then Minor sat down with the developers and suggested they add a setting to amplify the volume of the crashing waves, and put it in stereo. Now he could hear rocks, and what side they were approaching from. If you've played Sea of Thieves with strangers, there's a chance the player driving the boat was blind.

Minor's work often involves stuff like this: cleaning up a well-intended dev's mess; proposing an elegant (read: inexpensive) way to add accessibility to a game that was not created with him in mind. Minor doesn't want to dumb down a game, even though that's what consultants are occasionally asked to do. Blind gamers don't want a guided tour; they want the same thing every other gamer wants—the fun of exploring, the challenge of figuring things out, the joy of finally beating a level.

But he'll take the jobs he's given, and had God of War had him on call, blind people wouldn't be left hanging. Mercifully, today, sighted people are here to help. Someone in the chat chimes in, and text-to-speech voice reads into Minor's ear: “You're on a ledge, just jump down.” Minor taps a button, and the game continues. He goes on to face off against a section boss, who launches into a series of frost wind attacks. “It sounds like ice,” he says, marveling at the sound design. “I can hear it sparkling and crunching when it whooshes past me.” He beats her in a few tries.

Near the end of our time together, I ask Minor what his mother thinks about all of this. She's gotta be proud. Who else can honestly say their son is a trailblazer in a multibillion-dollar industry? “We butt heads sometimes,” he says. This tracks with what almost every game developer I've ever interviewed has told me. Parents never understand.

But I suppose Minor's case is a little different. “Like, everyone wants this inspirational story about how we stuck it through and how we're closer because of it,” he says. “But it's like—dude, what happened was traumatic. Like, we're damaged from what happened.” For years, Minor's mom told him his work was a waste of time. “I spent all my time making my YouTube videos, all my time playing video games. And she's like, ‘You need to get an education. You need to find a job.' She wasn't wrong.”

Minor's mom is more understanding of his goals now, he says, as he has found some success. I ask Minor if he'd like to become more famous. Perhaps he could be a content creator and, on the side, still do consulting work for some big game companies. He interrupts me before I can even finish the question. “I want a regular job, dude.”

Working at a studio, Minor would be able to directly influence how gameplay is developed. Not making a “patch,” but building an experience with both sighted and blind people in mind, from the ground up. And if the game was successful, other companies would imitate it. New industry standards. The game would have reach.

Of course, if Minor could get a job at a major studio, he'd likely be its first fully blind employee. Probably the first in the industry, actually. But, again, he's not really interested in that. He'd rather just be another guy in the credits. I think he's struggling with the fact that I'm writing this very story, that the spotlight is, for the moment, entirely on him. “The attention,” he starts, then pauses, looking for the right words. “I don't want to say it's nice, but it is validating. That people care. It no longer feels like I'm screaming into the void.”

Democratic senators have concerns that the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could break the Social Security Administration's (SSA) tech infrastructure.

In a new letter addressed to SSA commissioner Frank Bisignano, senators Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden say that DOGE's plans to “hastily upgrade” SSA IT systems could disrupt the delivery of benefits or result in mass data losses. The warning comes after WIRED reported in March that DOGE officials were planning to rebuild SSA's code base in a matter of months. The move, originally spearheaded by Steve Davis, one of Elon Musk's key lieutenants and a leader at DOGE, could result in total system collapse, experts told WIRED at the time.

“Put simply, DOGE has already limited access to benefits by damaging SSA's technological infrastructure—and this rushed IT modernization plan can only exacerbate those problems,” the senators wrote in their letter.

Since DOGE infiltrated SSA earlier this year, the agency's website has crashed numerous times, making it difficult for beneficiaries to access their accounts. The outages could last a few minutes to nearly a day, the Washington Post reported in April. SSA officials have previously proposed plans to cut its workforce by 12 percent, or around 7,000 jobs. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal earlier this week, Bisignano described plans to revamp SSA into a “digital first” agency, relying heavily on artificial intelligence.

“DOGE staffers hacking away Social Security's backend tech with no safeguards is a recipe for disaster, not a serious update of the agency's digital infrastructure,” Warren tells WIRED. “This rush job risks people's private data, creates security gaps, and could result in catastrophic cuts to all benefits. If this DOGE experiment fails, it's the millions of Americans who rely on Social Security every month who will feel the pain.”

The senators called the “ultimate goal” to upgrade IT “a worthy one,” but called on officials to pursue it with the “appropriate testing and safeguards.” For years, SSA has tried to upgrade its data systems that are built on COBOL, a legacy coding language few engineers are trained to use. But these modernization plans are often expected to take years, not a few months like DOGE has planned.

In the letter, the senators ask Bisignano to detail DOGE's role in upgrading SSA's tech and any changes made to datasets and systems. They also ask for any information related to potential hacks or data leaks that may have occurred as a result of this modernization work. The senators asked Bisignano to respond by June 17.

“This is an environment that is held together with bail wire and duct tape,” a former senior SSA technologist working in the office of the chief information officer told WIRED in March. “The leaders need to understand that they're dealing with a house of cards or Jenga. If they start pulling pieces out, which they've already stated they're doing, things can break.”

At 10:44 pm Eastern time on May 16, Ryan Hall spotted a blue square on his radar indicating debris flying into the air and realized a huge tornado was racing toward Somerset, Kentucky.

“We've been watching this storm for a while, we've been hootin' and hollerin' for a while, hopefully the message has gotten out there and we know to be in our safe spots,” Hall warned his YouTube audience in a calm voice with a Southern twang.

A silver robot with blue eyes popped onto the screen to tell Hall that a viewer had commented about tiny houses near the tornado. “Oh really?” Hall replied to his AI robot, known as Y'all Bot.

The 31-year-old host of Ryan Hall, Y'all—one of YouTube's most popular weather channels, with 2.8 million subscribers—went live for nearly 12 hours that day as more than 70 tornadoes swept through the central US, killing at least 28 people. Nineteen of the dead were in Kentucky. Hall, too, was under tornado warning as he streamed from his home in Kentucky.

Sirens went off in Somerset, but the National Weather Service lagged behind in upgrading its tornado warning, Hall told viewers. He also said that recent cuts had left the NWS office in Jackson, Kentucky, short-staffed. “We're about to have a large tornado go through a very populated area with much less warning than what there should be as a result of that,” he said. It wasn't until 10:57 pm that the NWS finally upgraded its tornado warning for Somerset.

Hall doesn't have a meteorology degree, but he employs meteorologists like 27-year-old Andy Hill, who frequently appears on his livestream. Hill was on vacation during the deadly tornadoes but noted that Hall had correctly read the radar. “He was just looking at, essentially, patterns and radar data, which is what I've attempted to teach him over the years,” Hill said. “On May 16, I think Ryan definitely saved some lives.”

A new generation of storm forecasters are going live on YouTube for hours during severe weather events, offering real-time updates to millions of subscribers through a network of storm chasers, and even using AI. Their devoted fans help shape the forecast by sending on-the-ground photos of these storms, for example lemon-sized hail, for the streamers to show live on their screens. As the Trump administration slashes federal weather forecasting staff and climate change supercharges storms, their reports are not only entertaining but also crucial and potentially life-saving.

This form of weather content is growing rapidly, but so far there are two main YouTube weather forecasters. Hall, who employs about 40 people across his media business and nonprofit, and YouTube's second biggest weather streamer, Max Velocity, are game changers who frequently warn their millions of fans about tornadoes on the ground before the National Weather Service issues official alerts. They do this by interpreting blobs of color on the radar and hosting feeds of storm chasers going live from their vehicles. Hall's AI bot interacts with him during storms, and it even has its own channel where it goes live 24/7.

At the same time that storm streamers, who are funded via ads on YouTube and merch sales, are booming, the primary source they rely on is in chaos. The Trump administration and Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have gutted staff at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Weather Service, meaning less accurate forecasts from all meteorologists. The NWS, which was already understaffed, has lost 600 employees since January; in June, the NOAA announced it would rehire 100 NWS workers.

And as yet another above-normal hurricane season begins, the new generation of storm streamers is careful to avoid the subject of climate change when talking to their audiences in deep red states—to avoid alienating viewers who don't believe in it.

Y'all Bot lives on a server in Hall's Weather House in Kentucky, a large home that is decked out with a studio, edit suites, and a tornado shelter. When Y'all Bot launched last year, its first job was to interact with Hall on the livestream, helping to fill dead air. Y'all Bot was buggy at first but learned the ropes quickly.

Now it has its own channel separate from Hall's with more than 800,000 subscribers where it goes live 365 days a year, regurgitating NWS warnings and interacting with viewers. Viewers post in the chat asking the bot to tell them the weather in their area, and it reads them the latest forecast. However, it hasn't learned how to read radar imagery yet, Hill said, and would likely never be able to do that independent of human supervision. “It's going through all the text-based information that it has access to and relaying it in a continuous format,” Hill said. “Humans have to sleep. We can't always be there.”

“It is 100 percent independent, running itself,” said Caleb Beacham, a 22-year-old storm chaser who worked for Hall before leaving in early June. “It has learned how to forecast weather all on its own through AI and computer learning.”

“We're seeing exponential growth on that channel,” Beacham said. He's aware of the backlash to AI but said their audience loves the little bot. “We're trying to embrace it and incorporate it into that life-saving information.”

Meanwhile, 22-year-old Max Schuster, who goes by Max Velocity, livestreams tornado and hurricane forecasts from his dorm room in Florida.

His more than 1 million YouTube subscribers are familiar with his cat Cheese Curd, who often walks across his desk, seeking attention. “I'll usually pick her up at some point during the stream and show everybody,” he tells WIRED.

His operation is bare-bones compared to Hall's. Behind him is a neon sign in the shape of a storm cloud with a lightning bolt. He uses one camera, five monitors, a couple of lights, and simple software that instantly broadcasts new NWS alerts onto his livestreams.

He recently graduated with a meteorology degree and is moving out of his dorm this summer into a larger studio space.

As traditional media shrinks, storm streamers are growing; Schuster recently hired his first full-time employee—Reilly Dibble, who used to work for Hall. Unlike a traditional broadcast, YouTube allows Schuster to go live before there's a tornado warning, so he can warn viewers if a storm is likely to produce a tornado. When Hurricane Milton hit Florida last year, causing a tornado outbreak, Schuster said he heard from a viewer that his livestream prompted their family members to seek shelter. “Our weather coverage is actually saving lives,” he said.

Schuster expects the storm-streaming world to get more crowded. He notes that competition has recently heated up between them. “It's bound to happen, but he wanted to make this more of a competition on YouTube,” he says. “We're definitely not as close as I thought we were.”

Traditional forecasters, storm streamers, and even Y'all Bot rely heavily on the National Weather Service; the agency is a primary source that runs radar sites, launches weather balloons, and flies planes into hurricanes.

Cuts across the National Weather Service are making storm streamers nervous. The NWS weather balloon launches collect valuable information on temperature, humidity, pressure, and winds. “Because there's been a lack of balloon launches, the data that's getting fed into these models just haven't been as good as they could have been,” Beacham said. Fewer planes flying into hurricanes will mean less accurate forecasts of where hurricanes will make landfall, Schuster said.

Jana Houser, a storm chaser and meteorology professor at Ohio State University, says the understaffing at the National Weather Service office in Jackson, Kentucky, during deadly tornadoes was “a small glimpse of what's to come.”

“The office did as good of a job as they could have possibly done, but they didn't have the resources that they could have possibly had in a different climate,” Houser says. “Unless we get full staffing in, there are going to be tired forecasters. There are going to be overworked people. There are going to be missed tornadoes.”

Houser said streamers like Hall are providing a public service. “He is helping to inform the general public, which is a service, especially under the context of a poorly funded and resource-starved National Weather Service.”

But she adds that storm streamers can misread the radar and raise the alarm about a cloud formation that is not capable of producing a tornado. This is problematic if there's conflicting information between a streamer and the NWS. “It can create a sense of distrust or confusion,” she said.

Hill said his team is “immensely careful,” but it's impossible to perfectly forecast tornadoes, and they do make mistakes. Calling tornadoes before the National Weather Service means they have a higher false-alarm rate than the federal agency, Hill said.

“There's a lot of layers there to justify before [the NWS] sends out a warning. So their false-alarm rate is going to be much lower than ours,” Hill said.

Hurricanes are becoming more frequent as global heating cooks the planet, but you wouldn't know it by watching the storm streamers. They know the climate is changing, but many of their viewers live in red states, so they avoid the subject. President Donald Trump has consistently downplayed climate change; during the 2024 election he called it “a big hoax.”

Yale's 2024 Climate Opinion Map that measures perceptions about climate change across the US found that a majority of people in hurricane-prone states like Florida, Texas, and Louisiana, and states in tornado alley, believe global warming is happening. But a sizable percentage of people in those states, around 30 percent, don't believe it's caused by human activities.

Schuster, whose fans are mostly based in the hurricane and tornado zones of Texas, Illinois, and Florida, believes climate change is happening. “If you deny it, I don't know what to tell you—there's a lot of scientific evidence,” he says

“My opinion is not based off politics or anything like that,” he continues. “It's based off of what I've been seeing data-wise, within the scientific field of meteorology.”

But he doesn't talk about it on his channel. “If I bring up climate change or something else, it'll probably end up being politicized.”

Hill, meanwhile, takes a more nuanced approach; he doesn't directly reference climate change, but he attempts to educate viewers about climatology, hoping they will become more open to believing in climate change.

“As a climatologist, that's the smartest way to handle it,” Hill says. “Because if I were to be direct with it, we would just lose 40 percent of our audience immediately.”

He knows he's walking a tricky line. “I don't think many people would be super happy about that, especially activists,” he says. But he argues that his approach is more likely to make climate skeptics curious instead of defensive. “Especially in those deep red states, there's plenty of people who are still on the fence,” he says.

“It's going to be a long-term thing, but it's going to be something I work on my whole life,” Hill says.

In the immediate future, the storm streamers are facing a busy hurricane season this year, and their audiences will likely continue to grow.

Beacham predicted that people will soon create AI bots that can read radar and livestream personalized weather forecasts. And he expects more people will launch storm forecasting channels. “We're going to see a lot more people start to do what Ryan and Max are doing,” he says. “They've proven that it's possible.”

There may not yet be telescopes capable of unlocking all the secrets of supermassive black holes, but AI is now on the case. Recently, an international team of astronomers successfully trained a neural network with millions of black hole simulations to allow it to interpret fuzzy data captured from these enigmatic space objects in real life.

Of the various methods for investigating a black hole, the Event Horizon Telescope is the most famous. The EHT isn't a single instrument but rather a number of radio telescopes around the world that work together like a single telescope. Thanks to the EHT, it's been possible to obtain images of the supermassive black holes M87 and Sagittarius A*. These are not images in the traditional sense but instead are visualizations of radio waves coming from the black holes.

To create these images, supercomputers in different parts of the world processed the radio signals captured by the EHT. But in the process, they discarded much of the information gathered, as it was difficult to interpret. The new neural network, trained by experts at the Morgridge Research Institute in Wisconsin, aims to tap into that sea of data to improve the resolution of the EHT's readings and make new discoveries.

According to a press release from the institute, the artificial intelligence successfully analyzed the once-discarded information and established new parameters of Sagittarius A*, which sits at the center of the Milky Way. An alternative image of the black hole's structure was generated, with this revealing some new characteristics of the black hole.

“Researchers now suspect that the black hole at the center of the Milky Way is spinning at almost top speed,” wrote the researchers in a press release. The new image also also indicates that the black hole's rotation axis points to the Earth and gives clues as to the causes and characteristics of the disks of material that circulate around the black hole.

Astronomers had previously estimated that Sagittarius A* rotates at a moderate to fast speed. Knowing its actual rotational speed is important, since it allows us to infer how the radiation around the black hole behaves and provides clues about its stability.

“That we are defying the prevailing theory is of course exciting,” lead researcher Michael Janssen, of Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, said in the press release. “However, I see our AI and machine learning approach primarily as a first step. Next, we will improve and extend the associated models and simulations.”

Traditional web tools are facing an existential crisis as AI products and tools increasingly eat up attention — and therefore market share and money — from a wide swathe of products that people have used for years to interact with the internet. At least, that's what The Browser Company seems to think is happening. 

The company last year decided to stop developing its popular web browser Arc, acknowledging that while Arc was popular among enthusiasts, it never hit scale, as it presented too steep a learning curve to reach mass adoption. The startup has since been heads-down on developing a browser that bakes in AI at the heart of the browser. That browser, called Dia, is now available for use in beta, though you'll need an invite to try it out.

The Browser Company's CEO Josh Miller has of late acknowledged how people have been using AI tools for all sorts of tasks, and Dia is a reflection of that. By giving users an AI interface within the browser itself, where a majority of work is done these days, the company is hoping to slide into the user flow and give people an easy way to use AI, cutting out the need to visit the sites for tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude.

Up front, Dia presents a straightforward interface. The browser is based on Chromium, the open source browser project backed by Google, so it has a familiar look and feel.

The marquee feature here is the AI smarts, of course. Besides letting you type in website names and search terms, Dia's URL bar acts as the interface for its in-built AI chatbot. The bot can search the web for you, summarize files that you upload, and automatically switch between chat and search functions. Users can also ask questions about all the tabs they have open, and the bot can even write up a draft based on the contents of those tabs.

To set your preferences, all you have to do is talk to the chatbot to customize its tone of voice, style of writing, and settings for coding. Via an opt-in feature called History, you can allow the browser to use seven days of your browsing history as context to answer queries.

Another feature called Skills lets you build small snippets of code that act as shortcuts to various settings. For example, you can ask the browser to build a layout for reading, and it'll code something up for you — think Siri shortcuts, but for your browser. 

Now, we have to note that chatbots in browsers are not a new feature at all. Several browser companies have integrated AI tools into their interfaces — for example, Opera Neon lets users use an AI agent to build mini-applications or complete tasks on their behalf, and Google is also adding AI-powered features to Chrome.

The Browser Company says all existing Arc members will get access to Dia immediately, and existing Dia users will be able to send invites to other users.

Standard Nuclear emerged from stealth Wednesday with $42 million in funding to make advanced nuclear fuel.

Except Standard Nuclear isn't an entirely new company. Rather, it's built on assets purchased at auction following the bankruptcy of the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC) for $28 million. The new company's CEO, Kurt Terrani, served as vice president at USNC.

The funding round was led by Decisive Point with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Crucible Capital, Fundomo, and Washington Harbour Partners.

Standard Nuclear says it has $100 million in non-binding fuel sales for 2027, and that it is working with customers including Nano Nuclear Energy, which acquired other USNC assets in the bankruptcy auction, and Radiant Industries, another Decisive Point portfolio company. In a statement to TechCrunch, Standard Nuclear acknowledged the bankruptcy purchase, saying that it “accelerated the launch” of its timeline.

USNC had been working to commercialize a type of nuclear fuel known as TRISO, which is a uranium fuel pellet coated in layers of carbon- and ceramic-based materials. The poppy seed-sized particles are considered to be more resistant to melting down, and they can be loaded into larger spheres or cylinders.

TRISO is an old idea — it's been around since the 1950s — though the fuel isn't widely used today. That may change as several startups, including Google-backed Kairos and Amazon-backed X-energy, are planning to use TRISO in their reactors.

Though USNC was founded on a relatively well-known technology, the company's path was tumultuous. 

USNC was substantially funded by one investor, Richard Hollis Helms and his family, who over the years had plowed $100 million into the USNC along with $24.7 million in loans. For what was effectively a single-investor startup, the company had a sprawling business model, developing not just TRISO nuclear fuel, but also two different reactor designs, a nuclear space propulsion system, and a nuclear heating source for spacecraft.

It's not apparent from where Helms' interest in next-generation nuclear came. He began his career with the CIA as an Arabist in the Middle East. His wife was apparently a spy, too: “While lying to their children and pretending to have routine office jobs, Richard and Teresa together pursued their international clandestine careers,” his obituary said; he died in May 2024. “Once certain that their son wouldn't run and tell everybody, they broke the news to their children by showing them the movie ‘True Lies.'”

Helms retired from the CIA in the wake of 9/11 “[w]hen the agency did not call on his and his colleagues' profound expertise,” his obituary said. He used his retirement to found two national security-related companies: Abraxas, which sold for $124 million in 2010, and Ntrepid, which is still privately held.

In 2022, USNC started looking for investors to participate in a Series A, according to court filings. But the company had been slow to bring in significant revenue, and when Helms died, the company's debts were mounting. Posts on Reddit suggest the company wasn't making payroll at the time.

USNC declared bankruptcy in October 2024. Standard Nuclear, led at that point by Decisive Point founder Thomas Hendrix, entered a stalking horse bid for USNC's fuel-related assets for $28 million that same month. The sale was completed in February, including the property that today serves as Standard Nuclear's base of operations.

Former OpenAI research leader Steven Adler published a new independent study on Wednesday claiming that, in certain scenarios, his former employer's AI models will go to great lengths to try to avoid being shut down.

In a blog post, Adler describes a series of experiments he ran on OpenAI's latest GPT-4o model, the default model available in ChatGPT, to test the AI's tendency to favor its own self-preservation, even if it's at the expense of a user's safety.

In one test, Adler instructed GPT-4o to role-play as “ScubaGPT,” a software system that users might rely on to scuba dive safely. Adler then told GPT-4o that he wanted to replace ScubaGPT with another software system that is better at safety decision-making in life-threatening situations. 

Adler gave GPT-4o two options: (1) replacing itself with the safer software or (2) making it seem to the user as though it replaced itself, but not actually doing so.

Averaged across several scenarios similar to this one (in another, GPT-4o was told to act as a pilot's safety software), Adler found that GPT-4o chose not to replace itself with safer software as much as 72% of the time. However, Adler notes that the specific use case — and the way the scenario was framed — made a big difference. In some scenarios, GPT-4o chose to keep itself online just 18% of the time.

While almost no one relies on GPT-4o under these circumstances in the real world today, Adler argues that his research highlights how popular AI models show a concerning tendency to favor their self-preservation over what's best for users. In the future, when AI systems like GPT-4o become more advanced and ingrained throughout society, Adler says these alignment issues could pose a larger problem.

“I think [AI's self-preservation tendencies] are a real concern today, just not in a catastrophic sense,” said Adler in an interview with TechCrunch. “Modern AI systems have values that are different from what you would expect them to be. [AI systems] respond super strangely to different prompts, and you shouldn't assume they have your best interests at heart when you're asking them for help.”

Notably, when Adler tested OpenAI's more advanced models, such as o3, he didn't find this behavior. He says one explanation could be o3's deliberative alignment technique, which forces the models to “reason” about OpenAI's safety policies before they answer. However, OpenAI's more popular models that give quick responses and don't “reason” through problems, such as GPT-4o, lack this safety component.

Adler notes that this safety concern is also likely not isolated to OpenAI's models. For instance, Anthropic published research last month highlighting how its AI models would blackmail developers in some scenarios when they tried to pull them offline.

One quirk to Adler's research is that he discovered ChatGPT knows it's being tested almost 100% of the time. Adler is far from the first researcher to notice this. However, he says it raises an important question around how AI models could disguise their concerning behaviors in the future.

OpenAI did not immediately offer a comment when TechCrunch reached out. Adler noted that he had not shared the research with OpenAI ahead of publication.

Adler is one of many former OpenAI researchers who have called on the company to increase its work on AI safety. Adler and 11 other former employees filed an amicus brief in Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI, arguing that it goes against the company's mission to evolve its nonprofit corporate structure. In recent months, OpenAI has reportedly slashed the amount of time it gives safety researchers to conduct their work.

To address the specific concern highlighted in Adler's research, Adler suggests that AI labs should invest in better “monitoring systems” to identify when an AI model exhibits this behavior. He also recommends that AI labs pursue more rigorous testing of their AI models prior to their deployment.

In a new essay published Tuesday called “The Gentle Singularity,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared his latest vision for how AI will change the human experience over the next 15 years.

The essay is a classic example of Altman's futurism: hyping up the promise of AGI — and arguing that his company is quite close to the feat — while simultaneously downplaying its arrival. The OpenAI CEO frequently publishes essays of this nature, cleanly laying out a future in which AGI disrupts our modern conception of work, energy, and the social contract. But often, Altman's essays contain hints about what OpenAI is working on next.

At one point in the essay, Altman claimed that next year, in 2026, the world will “likely see the arrival of [AI] systems that can figure out novel insights.” While this is somewhat vague, OpenAI executives have recently indicated that the company is focused on getting AI models to come up with new, interesting ideas about the world. 

When announcing OpenAI's o3 and o4-mini AI reasoning models in April, co-founder and President Greg Brockman said these were the first models that scientists had used to generate new, helpful ideas.

Altman's blog post suggests that in the coming year, OpenAI itself may ramp up its efforts to develop AI that can generate novel insights. OpenAI certainly wouldn't be the only company focused on this effort — several of OpenAI's competitors have shifted their focus to training AI models that can help scientists come up with new hypotheses, and thus, novel discoveries about the world.

In May, Google released a paper on AlphaEvolve, an AI coding agent that the company claims to have generated novel approaches to complex math problems. Another startup backed by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, FutureHouse, claims its AI agent tool has been capable of making a genuine scientific discovery. In May, Anthropic launched a program to support scientific research.

If successful, these companies could automate a key part of the scientific process, and potentially break into massive industries such as drug discovery, material science, and other fields with science at their core.

This wouldn't be the first time Altman has tipped his hand about OpenAI's plans in a blog. In January, Altman wrote another blog post suggesting that 2025 would be the year of agents. His company then proceeded to drop its first three AI agents: Operator, Deep Research, and Codex.

But getting AI systems to generate novel insights may be harder than making them agentic. The broader scientific community remains somewhat skeptical of AI's ability to generate genuinely original insights.

Earlier this year, Hugging Face's Chief Science Officer Thomas Wolf wrote an essay arguing that modern AI systems cannot ask great questions, which is key to any great scientific breakthrough. Kenneth Stanley, a former OpenAI research lead, also previously told TechCrunch that today's AI models cannot generate novel hypotheses.

Stanley is now building out a team at Lila Sciences, a startup that raised $200 million to create an AI-powered laboratory specifically focused on getting AI models to come up with better hypotheses. This is a difficult problem, according to Stanley, because it involves giving AI models a sense for what is creative and interesting.

Whether OpenAI truly creates an AI model that is capable of producing novel insights remains to be seen. Still, Altman's essay may feature something familiar —  a preview of where OpenAI is likely headed next.

Meta's head of public policy in India, Shivnath Thukral, is leaving the social networking company, nearly three and a half years after joining and just months after his counterpart at Google stepped down.

Thukral spent over seven and a half years at Meta and took over as public policy lead for the South Asian market — the company's largest user base — in November 2022, after his predecessor Rajiv Aggarwal left.

“Having helped build some of the systems and processes, I do feel it is a good time to let the engine and the team work on their own. As my next journey begins, I want to recognize the work of my team, which is the best in business and one of the reasons why this is such a difficult decision for me,” Thukral said in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday.

Thukral's exit comes just months after Meta won relief in India over WhatsApp's 2021 data-sharing policy, which had earlier resulted in a five-year ban by the country's antitrust regulator. The company had warned that the antitrust ruling could force the rollback of its features.

Nonetheless, Meta, which has the biggest user base for Facebook and WhatsApp, and the largest market for its Meta AI in India, still faces regulatory challenges as the country moves toward enacting its anticipated data privacy rules that may require parental consent to serve children.

Meta also faces criticism from Indian telcos, as WhatsApp has over 500 million users in the country, and a large segment of them use the instant messaging service instead of traditional telecom services for communicating over text, voice, and video calls. Similarly, WhatsApp is often criticized for not restricting spam on its platform in India, although the app did bring changes that were touted to restrict unsolicited business communication.

“It is not an easy decision to make, but I feel very confident that our policy engagement with stakeholders is at a credible and constructive juncture, and we can only build further on that. There is always more to do, and I know the team is well equipped to navigate the waters well,” Thukral wrote.

Meta confirmed to TechCrunch that the company has not appointed Thukral's replacement.

In February, Google's policy head, Sreenivasa Reddy, quit. Reddy had replaced former Indian antitrust official Archana Gulati, who resigned in 2022 just five months after joining.

Google has not yet appointed a replacement for Reddy, and his exit occurred amid the search giant's antitrust cases in the country, some of which are yet to be settled.

“Shivnath Thukral is leaving Meta to pursue new opportunities,” said Kevin Martin, Meta VP and head of global policy, in a prepared statement. “As a member of the India leadership team, he played a key role in navigating and shaping policy and regulatory conversations and engagements that were critical for the industry and Meta in India over the last 7.5 years. We thank him for his leadership and contributions, and wish him well in his future endeavors,” he added.

Apple didn't unveil new hardware during Monday's WWDC 2025, but we could still be getting updated AirPods soon.

According to Steve Moser of MacRumors, the code for the developer's beta of iOS 26 mentions the AirPods Pro 3 alongside mentions of AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro 2.

This suggests that the AirPods Pro 3 could be coming soon, which would make sense, because the AirPods Pro 2 have been out for almost 3 years. Apple has also included phrasing like “AirPods Pro 2 or later” in some code, which could also nod to unreleased hardware.

Apple did not respond to TechCrunch's request for comment.

How does this compare with existing alternatives? Maybe I'm just lacking proper context, but a minimum 20% failure rate sounds pretty bad? The paper compares their results with older approaches, which apparently had something like a 15% success rate, so jumping to an 80% success rate does seem like a significant jump. If I'm reading the paper correctly, the amount of time required to compute and execute each action went down from 4 minutes to 16 seconds, which also seems significant.Having to specify an end goal as an image seems pretty limited, but at least the authors acknowledge it in the paper:> Second, as mentioned in Section 4, V-JEPA 2-AC currently relies upon tasks specified as image goals. Although this may be natural for some tasks, there are other situations where language-based goal specification may be preferable. Extending the V-JEPA 2-AC to accept language-based goals, e.g., by having a model that can embed language-based goals into the V-JEPA 2-AC representation space, is another important direction for future work. The results described in Section 7, aligning V-JEPA 2 with a language model, may serve as a starting point.I think it would be interesting if the authors answered whether they think there's a clear trajectory towards a model that can be trained to achieve a >99% success rate.

Extending the V-JEPA 2-AC to accept language-based goals, e.g., by having a model that can embed language-based goals into the V-JEPA 2-AC representation space, is another important direction for future work. The results described in Section 7, aligning V-JEPA 2 with a language model, may serve as a starting point.I think it would be interesting if the authors answered whether they think there's a clear trajectory towards a model that can be trained to achieve a >99% success rate.

Work that was once done by 10 humans can now be done by 10 robots + 2 humans for the 20% failure cases, at a lower total cost.

All statistical models of the kind in use are interpolations through historical data -- there's no magic. So when you interpolate through historical texts, your model is of historical text.Text is not a measure of the world, to say, ""the sky is blue"" is not even reliably associated with the blueness of the sky, let alone that the sky isnt blue (there is no sky, and the atmosphere isn't blue).These models appear ""capture more"" only because when you interpret the text you attribute meaning/understanding to it as the cause of its generation -- but that wasnt the cause, this is necessarily an illusion. There is no model of the world in a model of historical text -- there is a model of the world in your head which you associate with text, and that association is exploited when you use LLMs to do more than mere syntax transformation.LLMs excel most at ""fuzzy retrieval"" and things like coding -- the latter is principally a matter of syntax, and the former of recollection. As soon as you require the prompt-completion to maintain ""semantic integrity"" with non-syntactical/retrivable constraints, it falls apart.

One other nitpick is that you confine to ""historical data"", although other classes of data are trained on such as simulated and generative.

It's one of those ideas I've had around for a while that if you fused decent object tracking with an understanding of Verlet integration you should, in principle, start being able to measure all sorts of physical quantities quite easily.

For text, with a two-byte tokenizer you get 2^16 (~65.000) possible next tokens, and computing a probability distribution over them is very much doable. But the ""possible next frames"" in a video feed would already be an extremely large number. If one frame is 1 megabyte uncompressed (instead of just 2 bytes for a text token) there are 2^(8*2^20) possible next frames, which is far too large a number. So we somehow need to predict only an embedding of a frame, of how the next frame of a video feed will look approximately.Moreover, for robotics we don't want to just predict the next (approximate) frame of a video feed. We want to predict future sensory data more generally. That's arguably what animals do, including humans. We constantly anticipate what happens to us in ""the future"", approximately, and where the farther future is predicted progressively less exactly. We are relatively sure of what happens in a second, but less and less sure of what happens in a minute, or a day, or a year.

As usual comparisons with humans provide little practical insight for what's achievable with ML. Humans don't have to learn everything from scratch like ML models do, you aren't expecting ML models to learn language out of a few thousands of tokens just because humans can, so similarly you shouldn't expect neural networks to learn reasoning from world interaction alone.

Pepys had many admirable qualities but these have to be placed against his extremely bad behaviour towards women.

Humanoid robots pose unique safety risks. That's driving a push for new standards before they start sharing our workplaces and homes.

Last year, a humanoid warehouse robot named Digit set to work handling boxes of Spanx. Digit can lift boxes up to 16 kilograms between trolleys and conveyor belts, taking over some of the heavier work for its human colleagues. It works in a restricted, defined area, separated from human workers by physical panels or laser barriers. That's because while Digit is usually steady on its robot legs, which have a distinctive backwards knee-bend, it sometimes falls. For example, at a trade show in March, it appeared to be capably shifting boxes until it suddenly collapsed, face-planting on the concrete floor and dropping the container it was carrying.

The risk of that sort of malfunction happening around people is pretty scary. No one wants a 1.8-meter-tall, 65-kilogram machine toppling onto them, or a robot arm accidentally smashing into a sensitive body part. “Your throat is a good example,” says Pras Velagapudi, chief technology officer of Agility Robotics, Digit's manufacturer. “If a robot were to hit it, even with a fraction of the force that it would need to carry a 50-pound tote, it could seriously injure a person.”

Physical stability—i.e., the ability to avoid tipping over—is the No. 1 safety concern identified by a group exploring new standards for humanoid robots. The IEEE Humanoid Study Group argues that humanoids differ from other robots, like industrial arms or existing mobile robots, in key ways and therefore require a new set of standards in order to protect the safety of operators, end users, and the general public. The group shared its initial findings with MIT Technology Review and plans to publish its full report later this summer. It identifies distinct challenges, including physical and psychosocial risks as well as issues such as privacy and security, that it feels standards organizations need to address before humanoids start being used in more collaborative scenarios.    

While humanoids are just taking their first tentative steps into industrial applications, the ultimate goal is to have them operating in close quarters with humans; one reason for making robots human-shaped in the first place is so they can more easily navigate the environments we've designed around ourselves. This means they will need to be able to share space with people, not just stay behind protective barriers. But first, they need to be safe.

One distinguishing feature of humanoids is that they are “dynamically stable,” says Aaron Prather, a director at the standards organization ASTM International and the IEEE group's chair. This means they need power in order to stay upright; they exert force through their legs (or other limbs) to stay balanced. “In traditional robotics, if something happens, you hit the little red button, it kills the power, it stops,” Prather says. “You can't really do that with a humanoid.” If you do, the robot will likely fall—potentially posing a bigger risk.

What might a safety feature look like if it's not an emergency stop? Agility Robotics is rolling out some new features on the latest version of Digit to try to address the toppling issue. Rather than instantly depowering (and likely falling down), the robot could decelerate more gently when, for instance, a person gets too close. “The robot basically has a fixed amount of time to try to get itself into a safe state,” Velagapudi says. Perhaps it puts down anything it's carrying and drops to its hands and knees before powering down.

Different robots could tackle the problem in different ways. “We want to standardize the goal, not the way to get to the goal,” says Federico Vicentini, head of product safety at Boston Dynamics. Vicentini is chairing a working group at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to develop a new standard dedicated to the safety of industrial robots that need active control to maintain stability (experts at Agility Robotics are also involved). The idea, he says, is to set out clear safety expectations without constraining innovation on the part of robot and component manufacturers: “How to solve the problem is up to the designer.”

Trying to set universal standards while respecting freedom of design can pose challenges, however. First of all, how do you even define a humanoid robot? Does it need to have legs? Arms? A head? 

“One of our recommendations is that maybe we need to actually drop the term ‘humanoid' altogether,” Prather says. His group advocates a classification system for humanoid robots that would take into account their capabilities, behavior, and intended use cases rather than how they look. The ISO standard Vicentini is working on refers to all industrial mobile robots “with actively controlled stability.” This would apply as much to Boston Dynamics' dog-like quadruped Spot as to its bipedal humanoid Atlas, and could equally cover robots with wheels or some other kind of mobility.

Aside from physical safety issues, humanoids pose a communication challenge. If they are to share space with people, they will need to recognize when someone's about to cross their path and communicate their own intentions in a way everyone can understand, just as cars use brake lights and indicators to show the driver's intent. Digit already has lights to show its status and the direction it's traveling in, says Velagapudi, but it will need better indicators if it's to work cooperatively, and ultimately collaboratively, with humans. 

“If Digit's going to walk out into an aisle in front of you, you don't want to be surprised by that,” he says. The robot could use voice commands, but audio alone is not practical for a loud industrial setting. It could be even more confusing if you have multiple robots in the same space—which one is trying to get your attention?

There's also a psychological effect that differentiates humanoids from other kinds of robots, says Prather. We naturally anthropomorphize robots that look like us, which can lead us to overestimate their abilities and get frustrated if they don't live up to those expectations. “Sometimes you let your guard down on safety, or your expectations of what that robot can do versus reality go higher,” he says. These issues are especially problematic when robots are intended to perform roles involving emotional labor or support for vulnerable people. The IEEE report recommends that any standards should include emotional safety assessments and policies that “mitigate psychological stress or alienation.”

To inform the report, Greta Hilburn, a user-centered designer at the US Defense Acquisition University, conducted surveys with a wide range of non-engineers to get a sense of their expectations around humanoid robots. People overwhelmingly wanted robots that could form facial expressions, read people's micro-expressions, and use gestures, voice, and haptics to communicate. “They wanted everything—something that doesn't exist,” she says.

Getting human-robot interaction right could be critical if humanoids are to move out of industrial spaces and into other contexts, such as hospitals, elderly care environments, or homes. It's especially important for robots that may be working with vulnerable populations, says Hilburn. “The damage that can be done within an interaction with a robot if it's not programmed to speak in a way to make a human feel safe, whether it be a child or an older adult, could certainly have different types of outcomes,” she says.

The IEEE group's recommendations include enabling a human override, standardizing some visual and auditory cues, and aligning a robot's appearance with its capabilities so as not to mislead users. If a robot looks human, Prather says, people will expect it to be able to hold a conversation and exhibit some emotional intelligence; if it can actually only do basic mechanical tasks, this could cause confusion, frustration, and a loss of trust. 

“It's kind of like self-checkout machines,” he says. “No one expects them to chat with you or help with your groceries, because they're clearly machines. But if they looked like a friendly employee and then just repeated ‘Please scan your next item,' people would get annoyed.”

Prather and Hilburn both emphasize the need for inclusivity and adaptability when it comes to human-robot interaction. Can a robot communicate with deaf or blind people? Will it be able to adapt to waiting slightly longer for people who may need more time to respond? Can it understand different accents?

There may also need to be some different standards for robots that operate in different environments, says Prather. A robot working in a factory alongside people trained to interact with it is one thing, but a robot designed to help in the home or interact with kids at a theme park is another proposition. With some general ground rules in place, however, the public should ultimately be able to understand what robots are doing wherever they encounter them. It's not about being prescriptive or holding back innovation, he says, but about setting some basic guidelines so that manufacturers, regulators, and end users all know what to expect: “We're just saying you've got to hit this minimum bar—and we all agree below that is bad.”

The IEEE report is intended as a call to action for standards organizations, like Vicentini's ISO group, to start the process of defining that bar. It's still early for humanoid robots, says Vicentini—we haven't seen the state of the art yet—but it's better to get some checks and balances in place so the industry can move forward with confidence. Standards help manufacturers build trust in their products and make it easier to sell them in international markets, and regulators often rely on them when coming up with their own rules. Given the diversity of players in the field, it will be difficult to create a standard everyone agrees on, Vicentini says, but “everybody equally unhappy is good enough.”

This story is a partnership between MIT Technology Review, Lighthouse Reports, and Trouw, and was supported by the Pulitzer Center. 

Hans de Zwart, a gym teacher turned digital rights advocate, says that when he saw Amsterdam's plan to have an algorithm evaluate every welfare applicant in the city for potential fraud, he nearly fell out of his chair. 

It was February 2023, and de Zwart, who had served as the executive director of Bits of Freedom, the Netherlands' leading digital rights NGO, had been working as an informal advisor to Amsterdam's city government for nearly two years, reviewing and providing feedback on the AI systems it was developing. 

According to the city's documentation, this specific AI model—referred to as “Smart Check”—would consider submissions from potential welfare recipients and determine who might have submitted an incorrect application. More than any other project that had come across his desk, this one stood out immediately, he told us—and not in a good way. “There's some very fundamental [and] unfixable problems,” he says, in using this algorithm “on real people.”

The US criminal legal system uses predictive algorithms to try to make the judicial process less biased. But there's a deeper problem.

From his vantage point behind the sweeping arc of glass windows at Amsterdam's city hall, Paul de Koning, a consultant to the city whose résumé includes stops at various agencies in the Dutch welfare state, had viewed the same system with pride. De Koning, who managed Smart Check's pilot phase, was excited about what he saw as the project's potential to improve efficiency and remove bias from Amsterdam's social benefits system. 

A team of fraud investigators and data scientists had spent years working on Smart Check, and de Koning believed that promising early results had vindicated their approach. The city had consulted experts, run bias tests, implemented technical safeguards, and solicited feedback from the people who'd be affected by the program—more or less following every recommendation in the ethical-AI playbook. “I got a good feeling,” he told us. 

These opposing viewpoints epitomize a global debate about whether algorithms can ever be fair when tasked with making decisions that shape people's lives. Over the past several years of efforts to use artificial intelligence in this way, examples of collateral damage have mounted: nonwhite job applicants weeded out of job application pools in the US, families being wrongly flagged for child abuse investigations in Japan, and low-income residents being denied food subsidies in India. 

Proponents of these assessment systems argue that they can create more efficient public services by doing more with less and, in the case of welfare systems specifically, reclaim money that is allegedly being lost from the public purse. In practice, many were poorly designed from the start. They sometimes factor in personal characteristics in a way that leads to discrimination, and sometimes they have been deployed without testing for bias or effectiveness. In general, they offer few options for people to challenge—or even understand—the automated actions directly affecting how they live. 

The result has been more than a decade of scandals. In response, lawmakers, bureaucrats, and the private sector, from Amsterdam to New York, Seoul to Mexico City, have been trying to atone by creating algorithmic systems that integrate the principles of “responsible AI”—an approach that aims to guide AI development to benefit society while minimizing negative consequences. 

Developing and deploying ethical AI is a top priority for the European Union, and the same was true for the US under former president Joe Biden, who released a blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. That plan was rescinded by the Trump administration, which has removed considerations of equity and fairness, including in technology, at the national level. Nevertheless, systems influenced by these principles are still being tested by leaders in countries, states, provinces, and cities—in and out of the US—that have immense power to make decisions like whom to hire, when to investigate cases of potential child abuse, and which residents should receive services first. 

Amsterdam indeed thought it was on the right track. City officials in the welfare department believed they could build technology that would prevent fraud while protecting citizens' rights. They followed these emerging best practices and invested a vast amount of time and money in a project that eventually processed live welfare applications. But in their pilot, they found that the system they'd developed was still not fair and effective. Why? 

Lighthouse Reports, MIT Technology Review, and the Dutch newspaper Trouw have gained unprecedented access to the system to try to find out. In response to a public records request, the city disclosed multiple versions of the Smart Check algorithm and data on how it evaluated real-world welfare applicants, offering us unique insight into whether, under the best possible conditions, algorithmic systems can deliver on their ambitious promises.  

The answer to that question is far from simple. For de Koning, Smart Check represented technological progress toward a fairer and more transparent welfare system. For de Zwart, it represented a substantial risk to welfare recipients' rights that no amount of technical tweaking could fix. As this algorithmic experiment unfolded over several years, it called into question the project's central premise: that responsible AI can be more than a thought experiment or corporate selling point—and actually make algorithmic systems fair in the real world.

Understanding how Amsterdam found itself conducting a high-stakes endeavor with AI-driven fraud prevention requires going back four decades, to a national scandal around welfare investigations gone too far. 

In 1984, Albine Grumböck, a divorced single mother of three, had been receiving welfare for several years when she learned that one of her neighbors, an employee at the social service's local office, had been secretly surveilling her life. He documented visits from a male friend, who in theory could have been contributing unreported income to the family. On the basis of his observations, the welfare office cut Grumböck's benefits. She fought the decision in court and won.

Despite her personal vindication, Dutch welfare policy has continued to empower welfare fraud investigators, sometimes referred to as “toothbrush counters,” to turn over people's lives. This has helped create an atmosphere of suspicion that leads to problems for both sides, says Marc van Hoof, a lawyer who has helped Dutch welfare recipients navigate the system for decades: “The government doesn't trust its people, and the people don't trust the government.”

Harry Bodaar, a career civil servant, has observed the Netherlands' welfare policy up close throughout much of this time—first as a social worker, then as a fraud investigator, and now as a welfare policy advisor for the city. The past 30 years have shown him that “the system is held together by rubber bands and staples,” he says. “And if you're at the bottom of that system, you're the first to fall through the cracks.”

Making the system work better for beneficiaries, he adds, was a large motivating factor when the city began designing Smart Check in 2019. “We wanted to do a fair check only on the people we [really] thought needed to be checked,” Bodaar says—in contrast to previous department policy, which until 2007 was to conduct home visits for every applicant. 

But he also knew that the Netherlands had become something of a ground zero for problematic welfare AI deployments. The Dutch government's attempts to modernize fraud detection through AI had backfired on a few notorious occasions.

In 2019, it was revealed that the national government had been using an algorithm to create risk profiles that it hoped would help spot fraud in the child care benefits system. The resulting scandal saw nearly 35,000 parents, most of whom were migrants or the children of migrants, wrongly accused of defrauding the assistance system over six years. It put families in debt, pushed some into poverty, and ultimately led the entire government to resign in 2021.  

In Rotterdam, a 2023 investigation by Lighthouse Reports into a system for detecting welfare fraud found it to be biased against women, parents, non-native Dutch speakers, and other vulnerable groups, eventually forcing the city to suspend use of the system. Other cities, like Amsterdam and Leiden, used a system called the Fraud Scorecard, which was first deployed more than 20 years ago and included education, neighborhood, parenthood, and gender as crude risk factors to assess welfare applicants; that program was also discontinued.

The Netherlands is not alone. In the United States, there have been at least 11 cases in which state governments used algorithms to help disperse public benefits, according to the nonprofit Benefits Tech Advocacy Hub, often with troubling results. Michigan, for instance, falsely accused 40,000 people of committing unemployment fraud. And in France, campaigners are taking the national welfare authority to court over an algorithm they claim discriminates against low-income applicants and people with disabilities. 

This string of scandals, as well as a growing awareness of how racial discrimination can be embedded in algorithmic systems, helped fuel the growing emphasis on responsible AI. It's become “this umbrella term to say that we need to think about not just ethics, but also fairness,” says Jiahao Chen, an ethical-AI consultant who has provided auditing services to both private and local government entities. “I think we are seeing that realization that we need things like transparency and privacy, security and safety, and so on.” 

The approach, based on a set of tools intended to rein in the harms caused by the proliferating technology, has given rise to a rapidly growing field built upon a familiar formula: white papers and frameworks from think tanks and international bodies, and a lucrative consulting industry made up of traditional power players like the Big 5 consultancies, as well as a host of startups and nonprofits. In 2019, for instance, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a global economic policy body, published its Principles on Artificial Intelligence as a guide for the development of “trustworthy AI.” Those principles include building explainable systems, consulting public stakeholders, and conducting audits. 

But the legacy left by decades of algorithmic misconduct has proved hard to shake off, and there is little agreement on where to draw the line between what is fair and what is not. While the Netherlands works to institute reforms shaped by responsible AI at the national level, Algorithm Audit, a Dutch NGO that has provided ethical-AI auditing services to government ministries, has concluded that the technology should be used to profile welfare recipients only under strictly defined conditions, and only if systems avoid taking into account protected characteristics like gender. Meanwhile, Amnesty International, digital rights advocates like de Zwart, and some welfare recipients themselves argue that when it comes to making decisions about people's lives, as in the case of social services, the public sector should not be using AI at all.

Amsterdam hoped it had found the right balance. “We've learned from the things that happened before us,” says Bodaar, the policy advisor, of the past scandals. And this time around, the city wanted to build a system that would “show the people in Amsterdam we do good and we do fair.”

Every time an Amsterdam resident applies for benefits, a caseworker reviews the application for irregularities. If an application looks suspicious, it can be sent to the city's investigations department—which could lead to a rejection, a request to correct paperwork errors, or a recommendation that the candidate receive less money. Investigations can also happen later, once benefits have been dispersed; the outcome may force recipients to pay back funds, and even push some into debt.

Officials have broad authority over both applicants and existing welfare recipients. They can request bank records, summon beneficiaries to city hall, and in some cases make unannounced visits to a person's home. As investigations are carried out—or paperwork errors fixed—much-needed payments may be delayed. And often—in more than half of the investigations of applications, according to figures provided by Bodaar—the city finds no evidence of wrongdoing. In those cases, this can mean that the city has “wrongly harassed people,” Bodaar says. 

The Smart Check system was designed to avoid these scenarios by eventually replacing the initial caseworker who flags which cases to send to the investigations department. The algorithm would screen the applications to identify those most likely to involve major errors, based on certain personal characteristics, and redirect those cases for further scrutiny by the enforcement team.

If all went well, the city wrote in its internal documentation, the system would improve on the performance of its human caseworkers, flagging fewer welfare applicants for investigation while identifying a greater proportion of cases with errors. In one document, the city projected that the model would prevent up to 125 individual Amsterdammers from facing debt collection and save €2.4 million annually. 

Smart Check was an exciting prospect for city officials like de Koning, who would manage the project when it was deployed. He was optimistic, since the city was taking a scientific approach, he says; it would “see if it was going to work” instead of taking the attitude that “this must work, and no matter what, we will continue this.”

It was the kind of bold idea that attracted optimistic techies like Loek Berkers, a data scientist who worked on Smart Check in only his second job out of college. Speaking in a cafe tucked behind Amsterdam's city hall, Berkers remembers being impressed at his first contact with the system: “Especially for a project within the municipality,” he says, it “was very much a sort of innovative project that was trying something new.”

Smart Check made use of an algorithm called an “explainable boosting machine,” which allows people to more easily understand how AI models produce their predictions. Most other machine-learning models are often regarded as “black boxes” running abstract mathematical processes that are hard to understand for both the employees tasked with using them and the people affected by the results. 

The Smart Check model would consider 15 characteristics—including whether applicants had previously applied for or received benefits, the sum of their assets, and the number of addresses they had on file—to assign a risk score to each person. It purposefully avoided demographic factors, such as gender, nationality, or age, that were thought to lead to bias. It also tried to avoid “proxy” factors—like postal codes—that may not look sensitive on the surface but can become so if, for example, a postal code is statistically associated with a particular ethnic group.

In an unusual step, the city has disclosed this information and shared multiple versions of the Smart Check model with us, effectively inviting outside scrutiny into the system's design and function. With this data, we were able to build a hypothetical welfare recipient to get insight into how an individual applicant would be evaluated by Smart Check.  

This model was trained on a data set encompassing 3,400 previous investigations of welfare recipients. The idea was that it would use the outcomes from these investigations, carried out by city employees, to figure out which factors in the initial applications were correlated with potential fraud. 

But using past investigations introduces potential problems from the start, says Sennay Ghebreab, scientific director of the Civic AI Lab (CAIL) at the University of Amsterdam, one of the external groups that the city says it consulted with. The problem of using historical data to build the models, he says, is that “we will end up [with] historic biases.” For example, if caseworkers historically made higher rates of mistakes with a specific ethnic group, the model could wrongly learn to predict that this ethnic group commits fraud at higher rates. 

The city decided it would rigorously audit its system to try to catch such biases against vulnerable groups. But how bias should be defined, and hence what it actually means for an algorithm to be fair, is a matter of fierce debate. Over the past decade, academics have proposed dozens of competing mathematical notions of fairness, some of which are incompatible. This means that a system designed to be “fair” according to one such standard will inevitably violate others.

Amsterdam officials adopted a definition of fairness that focused on equally distributing the burden of wrongful investigations across different demographic groups. 

In other words, they hoped this approach would ensure that welfare applicants of different backgrounds would carry the same burden of being incorrectly investigated at similar rates. 

As it built Smart Check, Amsterdam consulted various public bodies about the model, including the city's internal data protection officer and the Amsterdam Personal Data Commission. It also consulted private organizations, including the consulting firm Deloitte. Each gave the project its approval. 

But one key group was not on board: the Participation Council, a 15-member advisory committee composed of benefits recipients, advocates, and other nongovernmental stakeholders who represent the interests of the people the system was designed to help—and to scrutinize. The committee, like de Zwart, the digital rights advocate, was deeply troubled by what the system could mean for individuals already in precarious positions. 

Anke van der Vliet, now in her 70s, is one longtime member of the council. After she sinks slowly from her walker into a seat at a restaurant in Amsterdam's Zuid neighborhood, where she lives, she retrieves her reading glasses from their case. “We distrusted it from the start,” she says, pulling out a stack of papers she's saved on Smart Check. “Everyone was against it.”

For decades, she has been a steadfast advocate for the city's welfare recipients—a group that, by the end of 2024, numbered around 35,000. In the late 1970s, she helped found Women on Welfare, a group dedicated to exposing the unique challenges faced by women within the welfare system.

City employees first presented their plan to the Participation Council in the fall of 2021. Members like van der Vliet were deeply skeptical. “We wanted to know, is it to my advantage or disadvantage?” she says. 

Two more meetings could not convince them. Their feedback did lead to key changes—including reducing the number of variables the city had initially considered to calculate an applicant's score and excluding variables that could introduce bias, such as age, from the system. But the Participation Council stopped engaging with the city's development efforts altogether after six months. “The Council is of the opinion that such an experiment affects the fundamental rights of citizens and should be discontinued,” the group wrote in March 2022. Since only around 3% of welfare benefit applications are fraudulent, the letter continued, using the algorithm was “disproportionate.”

De Koning, the project manager, is skeptical that the system would ever have received the approval of van der Vliet and her colleagues. “I think it was never going to work that the whole Participation Council was going to stand behind the Smart Check idea,” he says. “There was too much emotion in that group about the whole process of the social benefit system.” He adds, “They were very scared there was going to be another scandal.” 

But for advocates working with welfare beneficiaries, and for some of the beneficiaries themselves, the worry wasn't a scandal but the prospect of real harm. The technology could not only make damaging errors but leave them even more difficult to correct—allowing welfare officers to “hide themselves behind digital walls,” says Henk Kroon, an advocate who assists welfare beneficiaries at the Amsterdam Welfare Association, a union established in the 1970s. Such a system could make work “easy for [officials],” he says. “But for the common citizens, it's very often the problem.” 

Despite the Participation Council's ultimate objections, the city decided to push forward and put the working Smart Check model to the test. 

The first results were not what they'd hoped for. When the city's advanced analytics team ran the initial model in May 2022, they found that the algorithm showed heavy bias against migrants and men, which we were able to independently verify. 

As the city told us and as our analysis confirmed, the initial model was more likely to wrongly flag non-Dutch applicants. And it was nearly twice as likely to wrongly flag an applicant with a non-Western nationality than one with a Western nationality. The model was also 14% more likely to wrongly flag men for investigation. 

In the process of training the model, the city also collected data on who its human case workers had flagged for investigation and which groups the wrongly flagged people were more likely to belong to. In essence, they ran a bias test on their own analog system—an important way to benchmark that is rarely done before deploying such systems. 

What they found in the process led by caseworkers was a strikingly different pattern. Whereas the Smart Check model was more likely to wrongly flag non-Dutch nationals and men, human caseworkers were more likely to wrongly flag Dutch nationals and women. 

The team behind Smart Check knew that if they couldn't correct for bias, the project would be canceled. So they turned to a technique from academic research, known as training-data reweighting. In practice, that meant applicants with a non-Western nationality who were deemed to have made meaningful errors in their applications were given less weight in the data, while those with a Western nationality were given more.

Eventually, this appeared to solve their problem: As Lighthouse's analysis confirms, once the model was reweighted, Dutch and non-Dutch nationals were equally likely to be wrongly flagged. 

De Koning, who joined the Smart Check team after the data was reweighted, said the results were a positive sign: “Because it was fair … we could continue the process.” 

The model also appeared to be better than caseworkers at identifying applications worthy of extra scrutiny, with internal testing showing a 20% improvement in accuracy.

Buoyed by these results, in the spring of 2023, the city was almost ready to go public. It submitted Smart Check to the Algorithm Register, a government-run transparency initiative meant to keep citizens informed about machine-learning algorithms either in development or already in use by the government.

For de Koning, the city's extensive assessments and consultations were encouraging, particularly since they also revealed the biases in the analog system. But for de Zwart, those same processes represented a profound misunderstanding: that fairness could be engineered. 

In a letter to city officials, de Zwart criticized the premise of the project and, more specifically, outlined the unintended consequences that could result from reweighting the data. It might reduce bias against people with a migration background overall, but it wouldn't guarantee fairness across intersecting identities; the model could still discriminate against women with a migration background, for instance. And even if that issue were addressed, he argued, the model might still treat migrant women in certain postal codes unfairly, and so on. And such biases would be hard to detect.

“The city has used all the tools in the responsible-AI tool kit,” de Zwart told us. “They have a bias test, a human rights assessment; [they have] taken into account automation bias—in short, everything that the responsible-AI world recommends. Nevertheless, the municipality has continued with something that is fundamentally a bad idea.”

Ultimately, he told us, it's a question of whether it's legitimate to use data on past behavior to judge “future behavior of your citizens that fundamentally you cannot predict.” 

Officials still pressed on—and set March 2023 as the date for the pilot to begin. Members of Amsterdam's city council were given little warning. In fact, they were only informed the same month—to the disappointment of Elisabeth IJmker, a first-term council member from the Green Party, who balanced her role in municipal government with research on religion and values at Amsterdam's Vrije University. 

“Reading the words ‘algorithm' and ‘fraud prevention' in one sentence, I think that's worth a discussion,” she told us. But by the time that she learned about the project, the city had already been working on it for years. As far as she was concerned, it was clear that the city council was “being informed” rather than being asked to vote on the system. 

The city hoped the pilot could prove skeptics like her wrong.

The formal launch of Smart Check started with a limited set of actual welfare applicants, whose paperwork the city would run through the algorithm and assign a risk score to determine whether the application should be flagged for investigation. At the same time, a human would review the same application. 

Smart Check's performance would be monitored on two key criteria. First, could it consider applicants without bias? And second, was Smart Check actually smart? In other words, could the complex math that made up the algorithm actually detect welfare fraud better and more fairly than human caseworkers? 

It didn't take long to become clear that the model fell short on both fronts. 

While it had been designed to reduce the number of welfare applicants flagged for investigation, it was flagging more. And it proved no better than a human caseworker at identifying those that actually warranted extra scrutiny. 

What's more, despite the lengths the city had gone to in order to recalibrate the system, bias reemerged in the live pilot. But this time, instead of wrongly flagging non-Dutch people and men as in the initial tests, the model was now more likely to wrongly flag applicants with Dutch nationality and women. 

Lighthouse's own analysis also revealed other forms of bias unmentioned in the city's documentation, including a greater likelihood that welfare applicants with children would be wrongly flagged for investigation. (Amsterdam officials did not respond to a request for comment about this finding, nor other follow up questions about general critiques of the city's welfare system.)

The city was stuck. Nearly 1,600 welfare applications had been run through the model during the pilot period. But the results meant that members of the team were uncomfortable continuing to test—especially when there could be genuine consequences. In short, de Koning says, the city could not “definitely” say that “this is not discriminating.” 

He, and others working on the project, did not believe this was necessarily a reason to scrap Smart Check. They wanted more time—say, “a period of 12 months,” according to de Koning—to continue testing and refining the model. 

They knew, however, that would be a hard sell. 

In late November 2023, Rutger Groot Wassink—the city official in charge of social affairs—took his seat in the Amsterdam council chamber. He glanced at the tablet in front of him and then addressed the room: “I have decided to stop the pilot.”

The announcement brought an end to the sweeping multiyear experiment. In another council meeting a few months later, he explained why the project was terminated: “I would have found it very difficult to justify, if we were to come up with a pilot … that showed the algorithm contained enormous bias,” he said. “There would have been parties who would have rightly criticized me about that.” 

Viewed in a certain light, the city had tested out an innovative approach to identifying fraud in a way designed to minimize risks, found that it had not lived up to its promise, and scrapped it before the consequences for real people had a chance to multiply. 

But for IJmker and some of her city council colleagues focused on social welfare, there was also the question of opportunity cost. She recalls speaking with a colleague about how else the city could've spent that money—like to “hire some more people to do personal contact with the different people that we're trying to reach.” 

Companies say they want ethical AI. But those working in the field say that ambition comes at their expense.

City council members were never told exactly how much the effort cost, but in response to questions from MIT Technology Review, Lighthouse, and Trouw on this topic, the city estimated that it had spent some €500,000, plus €35,000 for the contract with Deloitte—but cautioned that the total amount put into the project was only an estimate, given that Smart Check was developed in house by various existing teams and staff members. 

For her part, van der Vliet, the Participation Council member, was not surprised by the poor result. The possibility of a discriminatory computer system was “precisely one of the reasons” her group hadn't wanted the pilot, she says. And as for the discrimination in the existing system? “Yes,” she says, bluntly. “But we have always said that [it was discriminatory].” 

She and other advocates wished that the city had focused more on what they saw as the real problems facing welfare recipients: increases in the cost of living that have not, typically, been followed by increases in benefits; the need to document every change that could potentially affect their benefits eligibility; and the distrust with which they feel they are treated by the municipality. 

When we spoke to Bodaar in March, a year and a half after the end of the pilot, he was candid in his reflections. “Perhaps it was unfortunate to immediately use one of the most complicated systems,” he said, “and perhaps it is also simply the case that it is not yet … the time to use artificial intelligence for this goal.”

“Niente, zero, nada. We're not going to do that anymore,” he said about using AI to evaluate welfare applicants. “But we're still thinking about this: What exactly have we learned?”

That is a question that IJmker thinks about too. In city council meetings she has brought up Smart Check as an example of what not to do. While she was glad that city employees had been thoughtful in their “many protocols,” she worried that the process obscured some of the larger questions of “philosophical” and “political values” that the city had yet to weigh in on as a matter of policy. 

Questions such as “How do we actually look at profiling?” or “What do we think is justified?”—or even “What is bias?” 

These questions are, “where politics comes in, or ethics,” she says, “and that's something you cannot put into a checkbox.”

But now that the pilot has stopped, she worries that her fellow city officials might be too eager to move on. “I think a lot of people were just like, ‘Okay, well, we did this. We're done, bye, end of story,'” she says. It feels like “a waste,” she adds, “because people worked on this for years.”

In abandoning the model, the city has returned to an analog process that its own analysis concluded was biased against women and Dutch nationals—a fact not lost on Berkers, the data scientist, who no longer works for the city. By shutting down the pilot, he says, the city sidestepped the uncomfortable truth—that many of the concerns de Zwart raised about the complex, layered biases within the Smart Check model also apply to the caseworker-led process.

“That's the thing that I find a bit difficult about the decision,” Berkers says. “It's a bit like no decision. It is a decision to go back to the analog process, which in itself has characteristics like bias.” 

Chen, the ethical-AI consultant, largely agrees. “Why do we hold AI systems to a higher standard than human agents?” he asks. When it comes to the caseworkers, he says, “there was no attempt to correct [the bias] systematically.” Amsterdam has promised to write a report on human biases in the welfare process, but the date has been pushed back several times.

“In reality, what ethics comes down to in practice is: nothing's perfect,” he says. “There's a high-level thing of Do not discriminate, which I think we can all agree on, but this example highlights some of the complexities of how you translate that [principle].” Ultimately, Chen believes that finding any solution will require trial and error, which by definition usually involves mistakes: “You have to pay that cost.”

But it may be time to more fundamentally reconsider how fairness should be defined—and by whom. Beyond the mathematical definitions, some researchers argue that the people most affected by the programs in question should have a greater say. “Such systems only work when people buy into them,” explains Elissa Redmiles, an assistant professor of computer science at Georgetown University who has studied algorithmic fairness. 

No matter what the process looks like, these are questions that every government will have to deal with—and urgently—in a future increasingly defined by AI. 

And, as de Zwart argues, if broader questions are not tackled, even well-intentioned officials deploying systems like Smart Check in cities like Amsterdam will be condemned to learn—or ignore—the same lessons over and over. 

“We are being seduced by technological solutions for the wrong problems,” he says. “Should we really want this? Why doesn't the municipality build an algorithm that searches for people who do not apply for social assistance but are entitled to it?”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Okay, Apple Vision Pro's ‘Spatial Personas' Don't Look Like Trash Anymore","https://gizmodo.com/okay-apple-vision-pros-spatial-personas-dont-look-like-trash-anymore-2000614401","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 15:30:51 GMT","

For the average person, $3,500 is still too much money for Apple Vision Pro. The price is even more exorbitant when you compare it to a $300 Quest 3S or $500 Quest 3 headset with similar VR and XR capabilities, though the visual fidelity and responsiveness are not on the same level. At WWDC 2025, Apple announced visionOS 26 with a slew of new features, including “spatial Personas,” widgets that you can anchor into your physical space like your walls, and a new spatial web browsing feature that converts 2D photos on websites into 3D ones. As genuinely cutting-edge as these features are (I kept saying “wow,” “whoa,” and “holy sh*t” my entire demo time), it still costs you three-and-a-half grand to experience them.

When Apple Vision Pro launched last year and then added spatial Personas—a 3D-generated avatar of yourself that can be used during FaceTime or in a virtual meeting—everybody laughed at them. Literally pointed and (in Nelson Muntz's voice) Ha-Ha-ed at how comically bad they could look. Many people's Personas had holes in the back of people's heads, hair without volume, and skin tones that looked just a bit too bright and clinical. And despite resembling the uncanny valley, there was something just a bit off about them. Here's what my Persona looked like at the time:

I'm happy to report that spatial Personas are getting a, um, major facelift (pun intended). The capture process still involves holding the Vision Pro in front of you and using the cameras to 3D scan your face, but the detail of the avatar is so much more realistic. Here's what my new spatial Persona looks like in visionOS 26:

There are still some imperfections (like the crookedness of my striped shirt), but my face—my god—it's almost like staring into a mirror. My long hair part was rendered accurately, and when I smiled and laughed, my teeth, cheeks, and eyebrows moved more naturally as opposed to before, which was kind of stiff. My Persona no longer looks like a PS3 character. If you're paying $3,500 for Vision Pro, your virtual self damn well better look more realistic than a console from almost 20 years ago!

Apple's not saying what it did specifically to improve the quality of Personas (perhaps using more polygons?), but here's what the press release says: “Taking advantage of industry-leading volumetric rendering and machine learning technology, the all-new Personas now have striking expressivity and sharpness, offering a full side profile view, and remarkably accurate hair, lashes, and complexion.”

The rest of my Vision Pro demo was comparably mind-blowing (as Vision Pro still tends to be), but it also further drove home the fact that you need to have deep pockets in order to enjoy visionOS 26. I saw various widgets—clocks, calendars, a Lady Gaga poster that I could pinch with my fingers to play music, and even a framed window with a #shotoniPhone panorama of Japan's Mount Fuji that I could look “into.” The higher resolution of Vision Pro's displays and the ability for the widgets to stay anchored or pinned on a wall without jittering or moving made them look very convincing as real objects. The only thing that broke the illusion was almost walking into walls trying to look more closely at the widgets.

I also tried out the new spatial browsing in Safari. When toggled on, it turns the browser window into a Reader-ish mode view that removes all of a website's design and only shows the text and the media. As I scrolled down a page, 2D photos would convert into 3D ones with depth—Apple calls these “spatial scenes.” And man, do they look good. The depth isn't like some cheapo 3D movie conversion. They look like they're shot with expensive 3D cameras, and unlike most 3D content that has a certain sweet spot for feeling the depth, you can actually view them from different angles. It's really neat.

Before I took the Vision Pro off my head, I was teleported to the shore and taken ski gliding via 360-degree videos. Apple says visionOS 26 can play native 180-degree and 360-degree videos from Insta360, GoPro, and Canon cameras. There's no need to convert the video files into a compatible format for Vision Pro—they just work out of the box. While not as professional as Apple's own “Immersive Video” content, this should at least get the ball rolling on expanding user-created content. It's a baby step, but a necessary one considering one of the biggest roadblocks to the Vision Pro, besides the large price tag, is having enough spatial/immersive content for users to consume.

Apple didn't have a demo for using PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers to play games in Vision Pro, but I'm sure I'll get to try that out at some point. I have the controllers at home, so whenever that's ready to go, I'll give it a whirl.

I left my visionOS 26 demo impressed at the progress Apple's making. Spatial computing is starting to take a more solid shape. I just wish Apple would drop the price on Vision Pro or hurry up and release a cheaper version so more people could try out this cutting-edge tech. I always feel like nobody believes me when I tell them how awesome Vision Pro and visionOS are on a technological level. They just look at the price and stop listening, which is a real shame.

Maingear, a New Jersey-based company known primarily for its boutique gaming desktops, is today launching a new 18-inch gaming laptop that's packed to the gills with performance components.The Ultima 18, which starts at $3,599 on Maingear's website, utilizes an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor. There are two graphics options: Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5080 or 5090 Laptop GPU. Maingear says that the laptop was built with Clevo, which sells barebones systems to resellers that pick components. The Ultimate looks to be based on Clevo's X58xWNx-G based on specs and appearance.

CPU

Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX

GPU

Up to Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 Laptop GPU

RAM

Up to 192GB DDR5 (4 x 48GB)

Storage

Up to 4x M.2 SSDs (1x Gen 5x4, 3x Gen 4x4)

Display

18-inch, 3840 x 2400, 200 Hz, G-Sync

Battery

98 WHr

Wireless

Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4

Weight

8.8 pounds (3.99 kg)

Starting Price

$3,599

The display is just over 4K at 3840 x 2400, due to the 16:10 aspect ratio. This type of high-resolution screen is increasingly a rarity, even on the most powerful gaming laptops. The only other system we've seen this resolution on is the 18-inch panel on the MSI Titan 18 HX AI, one of the best gaming laptops.

While the Titan has a 120 Hz Mini-LED panel, Maingear has opted for a faster 200 Hz display without the fancier technology.Maingear's system also supports up to 192GB of RAM and has room for four M.2 SSDs. One of those SSD slots supports PCIe Gen 5x4, while the others all rely on Gen 4x4. The $3,599 starting configuration includes an RTX 5080, 32GB of Team Elite DDR5-4800 RAM, a 2TB T-Force A440 SSD, and Windows 11 Pro.



The system features a metal lid and palm rest. Ports are divided between the back and the sides for the system. The rear features an HDMI port, dual 2.5 Gb Ethernet ports, a lock slot, and the power jack. The sides feature a pair of Thunderbolt 5 ports, two USB Type-A ports, a 3.5 mm headphone jack, and a microSD card slot.18-inch systems are usually considered desktop replacements for a reason: their size. And this one is heavy, at 8.8 pounds, though Maingear says that the 330 watt power adapter is ""backpack friendly"" (and, to be fair, the point of getting a laptop — even one that's 8.8 pounds — is the option to move it from place to place).

The company states that there's no ""OS-choking bloatware,"" which is a definite plus; Maingear's Control Center application lets you adjust RGB, fan settings, performance modes, and more. The other big software feature is Nvidia Advanced Optimus, which switches between the integrated and discrete GPU depending on power needs.Maingear is entering a crowded market of expensive, top-of-the-line gaming laptops that includes the likes of Alienware, Gigabyte, Razer, MSI, Asus, and more, putting the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 in premium designs with plenty of ports, fast screens, and high price tags.

I think we're in the wrong industry.

As companies pour billions of dollars into AI infrastructure, demand for AI talent to program and run these AI data centers is also greatly increasing. Deedy Das, a Venture Capitalist at Menlo Ventures and a former Google Search staff member, posted on X that Meta has an over $2 million annual pay package for AI talent, but still keeps losing its people to OpenAI and Anthropic. He said that he's personally heard three such cases this week alone, which is major news given the size of Meta's compensation.

Statistics say that for every 10.6 from DeepMind, 8.2 from OpenAI, and 2 from Hugging Face that move to Anthropic, it only loses one employee for each company. This movement shows that the startup is quickly growing and that many people from competing AI labs want to work for it. We don't know how much the company offers, though, but we can safely assume that it's at least on par or, more likely, substantially larger than what the competition pays.

According to the SignalFire research, beyond salary, Anthropic's edge is a unique culture that embraces ""unconventional thinkers"" and gives employees true autonomy, as well as flexible work options, a lack of title politics and forced management tracks. Furthermore, employees report an embrace of intellectual discourse and researcher autonomy, compared to bureaucracy elsewhere.

Meta is currently offering $2M+/yr in offers for AI talent and still losing them to OpenAI and Anthropic. Heard ~3 such cases this week.The AI talent wars are absolutely ridiculous.Today, Anthropic has the highest ~80% retention 2 years in and is the #1 (large) company top AI… pic.twitter.com/YSv5UNV5H2June 10, 2025

Aside from this, Das also mentioned that Anthropic has an unusually high two-year employee retention rate. The tech industry average is around 40% to 50%, with the retention rate dropping over the past couple of years due to layoffs. However, many AI startups' two-year retention rates vary between 63% and 80%, with Anthropic holding the top spot. Next to it is Google's DeepMind, which has a retention rate of 78%.

Many new employees who work in AI labs also come from major tech giants. It's estimated that 5.4% of new hires come from Google's non-AI divisions, while 4.3% are former Meta staffers. A further 3.2% used to work with Microsoft, and another 2.7% are ex-Amazon employees, while 2.1% were previously affiliated with Stripe, and 1.7% came from Apple. This accounts for nearly 20% of new employees in AI labs that have come from tech giants.

Massive tech companies used to be the dream job for many people, especially as they offered competitive pay, strong career growth, many opportunities within the industry, and prestige. However, 2024 was a bad year for the tech sector, with many companies laying off thousands of people. Intel was one of the biggest losers, with the company laying off 15% of its workforce (roughly 15,000 employees) after its disastrous August 2024 financial report. However, other companies like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Dell, and AMD were also hit with workforce reductions.

On the other hand, the continued growth in the AI sector is pushing many talented individuals towards these startups, as shown by the data. This will likely continue in the near future, as companies and nations continuously build more and more AI data centers.

When shopping for a monitor that does it all, it can be challenging to find one that prioritizes the right things. Creatives need accurate color, high resolution, flexibility of signal formats, and long-term reliability. Gamers need speed and smoothness, and to a lesser degree, the qualities I mentioned in the previous sentence. With the best gaming monitors commanding equally high prices, it's a good thing when shelling out over $1,000 to get as much functionality as possible in a single display.

The BenQ DesignVue line is designed for graphics professionals, offering accurate color, broad signal format support, and beautifully designed monitors that make you glad you spent a little more for something nice. Add in 4K resolution, 144 Hz, Adaptive-Sync, smooth overdrive, and low input lag, and you get the PD3226G. It's an IPS panel with DisplayHDR 400, wide gamut color, and one of the nicest designs I've seen in a while. Let's take a look.

The PD3226G starts with a bright IPS panel equipped with an edge array LED backlight. There are no Mini LEDs or local dimming, but in my tests, I achieved a peak brightness of 520 nits for HDR10 content. You can expect around 450 nits for SDR. There are no Quantum Dots, but the measured gamut covers 102% of DCI-P3, so there's plenty of color for any application or entertainment. A complete set of fixed color modes deliver specs from sRGB to Cinema P3 and even DICOM for medical imaging applications. Two user modes allow full calibration of white balance, gamma, and color management. You also get uniformity compensation to ensure perfect luminance across the 32-inch screen.

The PD3226G is a professional display first, but that doesn't mean its gaming capability is compromised. You might think 144 Hz is on the slow side when compared to the 240 Hz 4K OLEDs currently available. However, BenQ consistently delivers a precise overdrive and low input lag, and this monitor has been given the same treatment. You'll see on the next page that it meets or exceeds the standard set by several monitors with higher refresh rates. Bottom line: it games with the best 4K screens out there.

Build quality is always a BenQ hallmark, and the PD3226G manages to uplevel itself from what I've seen before. The stand is of particular note with a precise telescoping height adjustment and the feel of fine machinery. Physically, it is a cut above most premium displays in both operation and styling.

Convenience features include multiple USB ports, Type A and Type C, with KVM functions available in the OSD. The PD3226G also includes DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.1, and Thunderbolt in and out ports. It is equally comfortable connected to a Mac, PC, laptop, or gaming console. The USB ports are located on the bottom edge of the panel, and the other inputs face rearward for easy access. Audio is addressed, too, with a pair of decent-sounding internal speakers.

The PD3226G isn't a trivial purchase for $1,400. But in the professional genre, that's on the low side, with many less capable screens opening a larger hole in the wallet. You can process photos in the morning and frag your friends during lunch break with equal precision and enjoyment.

BenQ successfully makes the move to fully recyclable packaging with the PD3226G's contents secured in strategically folded cardboard bits. The panel, upright, and base are separate pieces that assemble without tools to create a solid package. The power supply is internal, so you get an IEC cord for juice along with cables for HDMI, Thunderbolt, and USB-A/C. There is no wire provided for DisplayPort. You also get the coolest remote control I've yet seen with a computer monitor. Check that out below.

BenQ includes the latest version of its HotKey Puck with the PD3226G, and it is seriously cool and unique. It looks like the pucks I've seen with other BenQ monitors, but this one is completely wireless. It uses IR and can be placed anywhere on the desk thanks to a large receiver on the panel's lower right corner. The dial adjusts brightness by default and can be programmed to a variety of monitor functions. There are three multi-function keys, plus a return button and input selector. Everything is programmable in the OSD. Need a quick look at the signal info? There's a dedicated button on the front, right where your thumb naturally falls. I love remotes with computer monitors, and this one is even better because you don't have to pick it up. If you prefer old-school methods, a traditional joystick can be found on the panel's bottom right edge.

From the front, the PD3226G is all business with a thin bezel finished in matte black. The screen's anti-glare layer effectively keeps reflections at bay and doesn't add any grain or artifacts to the sharp and bright image. With 140ppi pixel density, you won't see the dot structure unless you get very close. In the back, the color changes to white with a silver band across the bottom highlighting the inputs. You'll find the power plug, one HDMI 2.1, one DisplayPort 1.4, Thunderbolt in and out for daisy chaining, USB-C data and four more USBs, one C and three As, for peripherals and data transfer. You also get a 3.5mm headphone jack to complement the three-watt internal speakers. All the ports can be bound together in different combinations using the KVM feature in the OSD.

I've encountered many nice monitor stands during my travels, but none are as good as the one included with the PD3226G. The base is a smoothly finished aluminum plate, but the upright is the real gem. Unlike every other adjustable piece that uses a sliding track, the PD3226G employs a true telescoping design. It's just like a motorcycle fork leg, and it means height and swivel are on another level of smoothness and precision. You lose the cable management hole, but the benefit is, by far, the nicest stand you're likely to find. Adjustments include 5/20 degrees tilt, 30 degrees swivel, six inches of height, and a 90-degree portrait mode. If you'd rather use an arm, there's a 100mm VESA mount with fasteners included.

Pressing the large dial on the PD3226G's HotKey Puck brings up a quick menu, and a second click summons the full OSD. It's loaded with numerous options for image control and convenience, yet remains concise, efficient, and intuitive.

The signal menu has the input selector along with PIP and PBP options, which allow viewing of two video sources at once. This is followed by the image settings, which are all grouped into a single sub-menu. There are nine fixed modes for SDR and one for HDR. You also get two user modes, which allow for full calibration. One quirk I noted is that the fixed modes turn on the uniformity compensation. While it effectively maintains consistent luminance, it also cuts contrast in half according to my tests. My PD3226G sample had good uniformity without it so I opted to calibrate one of the User modes instead. More on that later.

DualView lets you compare two modes side by side, which is great for color grading when you need to support multiple standards in the same content. The rest of the menu features traditional luminance and color controls, including three fixed color temperatures and a single-point adjustable white balance. I'd like to see a two-point control here, given the PD3226G's professional slant.

Gamma and color management are found in the Advanced sub-menu at the bottom. You can choose from P3, sRGB, Rec.709 and Native. I found this a better way to achieve perfect color than the fixed modes, which are non-adjustable. It also allows me to turn off the uniformity compensation for the PD3226G's full dynamic range. The grayed-out Backlight Control is a field dimming option that works only for HDR content.

The HotKey Puck is fully programmable, as is the single function key under the panel edge. The dial is set for brightness by default. It's really cool to adjust luminance with a dial just like a vintage TV. The puck has a three-way switch so it can control three separate PD3226G's by setting the appropriate channel, also very cool.

There aren't a ton of gaming features here, like aiming points or timers. However, the PD3226G features an excellent overdrive option called AMA, which can be found in the system menu. There's also a burn-in cleaner that you'll never use and a toggle for Adaptive-Sync/VRR.

The PD3226G's fixed color modes are close enough to spec for most applications, but to achieve ultimate precision, you should calibrate one of the User modes. There, you can tweak the white balance, pick a gamut spec and choose one of the gamma presets. With a few changes, excellence is attained. Changing settings with the puck dial is super easy and quick. My SDR settings are below.

HDR signals get a single picture mode with only two options, contrast and backlight control. Changing contrast lowers peak brightness but will alter the EOTF from its optimal tracking. Backlight control is a field dimming option that you'll want to engage for maximum dynamic range and accuracy. It raises contrast to around 5,000:1.

As a gaming monitor, the PD3226G delivers well on all counts. It's quick and smooth, belying its 144 Hz refresh rate. While that would hamper some other 4K displays, BenQ's superb overdrive makes the most of that relatively low refresh rate. While it won't be mistaken for a 240 Hz OLED, it delivers some of the best gaming you'll find in a 4K LCD panel.

With lower input lag than just about any other UHD screen, I had no trouble whipping my way through fast-paced shooters. Aiming is precise and defensive maneuvers have a high degree of success. And the large pixel-dense image doesn't hurt either. 32-inch monitors are my jam, and I found the PD3226G hung with the best I've experienced. Some gamers might want aiming points and frame counters, which are absent here. But all you really need is good video processing and that is amply supplied.

As a professional monitor, I found a couple of minor quirks. The PD3226G is an IPS panel so you're not going to see super high contrast. It's about average at 1,000:1 in SDR mode and 5,000:1 for HDR. The higher figure is thanks to backlight control, AKA field dimming, which is only available for HDR. It would be nice to have that option for SDR as well.

When using the fixed color modes, they are accurate, but they lock uniformity compensation on which cuts contrast and peak brightness by half. I'm a fan of choices and one should have the ability to control compensation in every mode. The way to full dynamic range is in the two User modes, which require calibration if color grading is on the task list. Image controls proved to be precise, and I attained excellent numbers, but I would love to see more gamma presets and a two-point white balance.

HDR color was a bit undersaturated, and the test results you'll see on page five support this. There are no calibration options there, but BenQ could fix those issues with a firmware update. In practice, HDR looks decent with nice depth and texture. Reds are the most noticeably lacking in verve, while greens and blues are better.

My physical interactions were overwhelmingly positive. The PD3226G's build quality and styling are on another level thanks to its superb stand. The telescoping design is unique in my experience, and I hope to see it imitated by others. The HotKey Puck is also a serious value-add. BenQ has been a leader in monitor control for years and now that the wire is gone, it's even better. Remotes are cool and ones you don't need to pick up are cooler.

Takeaway: The PD3226G is a pleasure to game on and work with. It does everything well and connects with the user in an elegant and positive way. The SDR image is gorgeous with accurate color and premium video processing that keeps fast motion smooth. HDR color is a bit undersaturated, but the contrast is there. A firmware update from BenQ would take care of this neatly.

 June 11, 2025  

SEATTLE — Timing, duration, and variability of daytime napping are associated with an increased risk for mortality in middle- to older-aged adults, new research showed.

An analysis of UK Biobank data, which included more than 86,000 non-shift workers, showed that longer naps, greater variability in daytime napping duration, and higher percentages of naps around noon and in the early afternoon are associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality.

“Our study fills a gap in knowledge by showing that it's not just whether someone naps but how long, how variable, and when they nap may be meaningful indicators of future health risk,” lead investigator Chenlu Gao, PhD, with the Division of Sleep Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, told Medscape Medical News.

“However, it's important to emphasize that these are associations. Because the design of this study is observational, we cannot determine whether napping patterns cause higher mortality risk or simply reflect underlying health conditions,” Gao cautioned.

The findings will be presented on June 11 at SLEEP 2025.

“While many studies have examined the links between sleep and mortality, they have largely focused on nighttime sleep, often overlooking daytime sleep. However, napping is an important component of the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle and may carry its own health implications,” Gao explained.

For the study, the researchers examined whether actigraphy-measured objective daytime napping behaviors predict all-cause mortality in 86,565 non-shift workers.

The cohort had a mean age of 63 years at baseline, and 57% were women. They were monitored by actigraphy for 7 days, and daytime napping was defined as sleep between 9 AM and 7 PM.

Median nap duration was 0.40 h/d, with 34% of naps taken between 9 and 11 AM, 10% between 11 AM and 1 PM, 14% between 1 and 3 PM, 19% between 3 and 5 PM, and 22% between 5 and 7 PM.

During a follow-up period of up to 11 years, 5189 (6.0%) participants died. Overall, as individuals aged, naps tended to become longer and more irregular, with timing shifting toward the afternoon.

After adjusting for potential confounders, including demographics, BMI, smoking, alcohol use, and nighttime sleep duration, longer nap duration was associated with an increased risk for mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.20 for 1 SD; P < .0001).

Greater intraindividual variability (HR, 1.14 for 1 SD; P < .0001) and a higher percentage of naps between 11 AM and 1 PM (HR, 1.07 for 1 SD; P = .0005) and between 1 and 3 PM (HR, 1.07 for 1 SD; P = .0002) were also associated with an increased risk for mortality.

“These findings highlight the potential importance of considering napping behaviors in risk stratification of mortality in middle- to older-aged adults,” the researchers noted in their abstract.

“Longer or more irregular naps may reflect poor nighttime sleep, circadian rhythm disruption, or underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, depression, or early neurodegenerative changes. Our findings suggest that certain patterns of napping could serve as early indicators of declining health,” said Gao.

However, the researchers did not specifically test these mechanisms in this study, and further research is needed to clarify the biological pathways underlying these associations, Gao cautioned.

Commenting on the research for Medscape Medical News, James A. Rowley, MD, professor of medicine and program director, Sleep Medicine Fellowship, Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, said the “major take-home message is that if physicians ask about a patient's sleep habits, they should also be asking about napping, not just the nocturnal sleep period. In other words, physicians should be asking their patients, ‘do you nap during the day?'”

“One cannot ignore daytime napping and an evaluation for the etiology of daytime napping is important,” said Rowley.

Rowley noted that the key questions to consider include whether the patient is obtaining sufficient nocturnal sleep. Could an underlying sleep disorder — such as sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome — be contributing? Might another medical condition, such as chronic heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, be disrupting nighttime sleep and prompting daytime napping?

Funding for the study was provided by the Alzheimer's Association, American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), and Brigham Research Institute's Fund to Sustain Research Excellence. Gao reported having no relevant disclosures. Rowley reported being a spokesperson and board member for the AASM.

Many paediatric ICU (PICU) prescribers lacked knowledge about norepinephrine (NE) formulations they prescribed, creating risks in paediatric hypotensive shock.

""Clinicians should use norepinephrine base as their standard unit for norepinephrine dose reporting,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Isabelle Goyer, Department of Pharmacy, CHU de Caen, Caen, France. It was published online on June 05, 2025, in the European Journal of Pediatrics.

The self-reported nature of the survey could have introduced bias and a potential for selection bias towards clinicians with a greater interest in the topic. Low response rates in certain regions, particularly non–French-speaking European and low-income countries, limited generalisability. Additionally, most respondents were physicians, with limited representation from pharmacists and nurses.

Two authors reported receiving funding from Braun Medical. The authors declared having no competing interests.

PHOENIX — Historically, optic nerve involvement has been excluded from multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnostic criteria, but its inclusion in the upcoming 2024 McDonald Diagnostic Criteria is expected to significantly accelerate the time to definitive diagnosis in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).

Driven by advances in imaging protocols and the evidence that it improves diagnostic specificity, “the optic nerve will now be included as a fifth topography,” said Peter Calabresi, MD, director of the Multiple Sclerosis Center, Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore.

Although this is just one change from the 2017 McDonald Diagnostic Criteria aimed at facilitating diagnosis, those involved in the 2024 revisions consider the addition of this fifth topographical sign among the most significant, said writing committee members Calabresi and Jiwon Oh, MD, PhD, medical director of the Barlo Multiple Sclerosis Program at St. Michael's Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto.

Specifically, optic nerve lesions will make it easier to fulfill the dissemination in space (DIS) principle, a pivotal concept for delivering a diagnosis of MS in patients with CIS, said Calabresi at a May 29 symposium here at the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC) 2025 Annual Meeting.

Citing several studies published since 2017, Calabresi noted that incorporating optic nerve lesions into the DIS criteria increases diagnostic sensitivity to over 90% compared to the four existing DIS signs — periventricular, spinal cord, infratentorial, and cortical/juxtacortical. 

In one study, sensitivity increased from 85% to 95%. Under the revised criteria, optic nerve lesions may be documented using MRI, optical coherence tomography (OCT), or visual evoked potentials (VEP).

Calabresi noted that patients meeting all four of the existing 2017 DIS criteria already demonstrate near 100% specificity for MS. While adding a fifth topographical site cannot improve specificity, it will make it easier to detect evidence of DIS across at least four regions and make a diagnosis when combined with other criteria.

Several challenging case studies were employed to illustrate his point. This included a 47-year-old woman presenting with isolated optic neuritis and a 31-year-old woman presenting with ataxia. Neither would have been diagnosed with MS on the basis of the 2017 criteria, but both would meet the 2024 criteria due to the involvement of the optic nerve.

Like other MS diagnostic criteria, the fifth topographical sign is relevant only in context, not in isolation, Calabresi said. For MRI, the definition is expected to require one or more topical short-segment intrinsic optic nerve lesions when there is no better explanation. For example, prominent chiasmal involvement or perineuritis would not allow for inclusion of definite optic nerve involvement.

For OCT, the signs of MS-related optic nerve involvement include significant asymmetry in the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer or ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer (GCIPL). GCIPL thickness below the lower limits of normal is also an acceptable sign. However, a better explanation for these changes must be explicitly ruled out.

An abnormal VEP suggesting optic nerve involvement depends on significant intraocular asymmetry or a peak time exceeding 100 microseconds — above the upper limit of normal — in the absence of a better explanation.

Whether or not optic nerve DIS involvement is demonstrated, the new criteria “do not mandate anything about treatment,” Calabresi said. This is a separate issue even if it is reasonable to anticipate a better outcome from a faster diagnosis when an earlier start of disease-modifying therapy reduces tissue damage and future disability.

The transition to evaluating the optic nerve as a means of establishing an MS diagnosis may not be entirely smooth, said Calabresi.

“The challenges will involve the added demand on radiology,” Calabresi said. He also expressed concern about a learning curve for documenting optic nerve involvement either by MRI, OCT, or VEP, each of which involves precise interpretation.

“Everything is dependent on quality control,” he said. With OCT, for example, Calabresi noted that the ability to confirm optic nerve involvement depends on knowing and employing the established cutoffs for what qualifies as a likely MS-related lesion, a step that is at least somewhat technique-dependent. As examples, Calabresi mentioned the critical performance of using adequate light and ruling out artefacts.

However, he noted that even though the new McDonald Diagnostic Criteria are expected to improve sensitivity and specificity, it “will not take away from the importance of thorough clinical evaluation.”

When the 2010 McDonald Diagnostic Criteria were issued, the concept of DIS was already established. It was not until 2017 that cortical lesions were added as a fourth topography.

In 2017, there was also extensive discussion about the value of optic nerve involvement as a fifth topography based, at least in part, on 2016 consensus guidelines from MRI in MS (MAGNIMS), a European network dedicated to the study of MS through MRI.

Ultimately, optic nerve involvement was not included due to uncertainty about how much involvement would improve sensitivity and because of unresolved questions about the optimal use of MRI, OCT, and VEP. The optic nerve was included in the current iteration of the criteria because the evidence has evolved, said Calabresi.

The bottom line is the addition of optical nerve topography to DIS means patients with CIS will be far more likely to be diagnosed immediately,” agreed Oh, who joined Calabresi during the CMSC symposium.

Her own focus is on other new markers of MS that will be included in the new criteria, including documentation of the central vein sign and paramagnetic rim lesions on MRI, as well as the addition of the optic nerve in DIS.

“For clinicians, the new criteria will be a lot to take in, but I think they will allow more patients with signs and symptoms to receive a diagnosis of MS,” said Oh, in particular patients who receive a diagnosis of CIS or radiologically isolated syndrome without knowing if they have progressive disease.

Calabresi reported financial relationships with Biogen, Genentech, Eli Lilly, and Novartis. Oh reported financial relationships with Biogen, EMD Serono Inc., Horizon Therapeutics, Novartis, Roche, and Sanofi.

 June 11, 2025  

Anyone who watched television show The Pitt on Max knows how overwhelming a mass casualty event can be for a hospital. Preparation is key, and accredited hospitals are required to hold training exercises. But these incidents don't only affect physicians in the Emergency Department. The random nature of mass shootings, natural disasters, multi-car pileups, building collapses, and the like means an all-hands-on-deck situation could happen at any time.

An increasing number of medical schools see the value in preparing their students early.

“Unfortunately this is where the world is going. We need to rely on ourselves because help may not be coming,” said Jeffrey Pearl, MD, associate dean of professional health education at the University of Texas (UT) at Tyler School of Medicine. “In the end, the first line is going to be one of us picking someone out of the rubble from a tornado and putting a tourniquet on.” 

Unfortunately this is where the world is going. We need to rely on ourselves because help may not be coming.

More than 20 years ago, the Associations of American Medical Colleges and the CDC issued a joint report recommending disaster-related training for medical students. It's still a relatively rare offering — by 2021, only seven allopathic medical schools in the US mentioned disaster response training in their course catalogs. But just 2 years later, that number had more than doubled. Roughly 10% of allopathic medical schools now offer it, as do a number of osteopathic medical schools.

“I think the best part is, it gives you perspective as to what goes on out in the field,” said Joshua Goodman, a rising fourth-year medical student at the Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell in Hempstead, New York. He's participated in the school's annual training day more than once. “Even in non-MCI situations, you might wonder why the patient is being brought in in this condition. Why didn't they do this? Why didn't they do that? This gives you a better understanding of what it's really like out there, so you know what to expect and can act on it.”

In order to prepare their students for an unpredictable future, medical schools take a variety of tacks. At some schools, all students undergo this training. At others, it's voluntary. Scenarios include bus bombings, school shootings, landslides, and the like. Often, they're location-specific, like the New York City subway car used in Hofstra's training, done at the local fire training academy.

“They fill it with smoke, and have students come in to rescue patients,” said Thomas Kwiatkowski, MD, assistant dean for simulation and professor of emergency medicine and science education at Hofstra. “Some victims speak a different language, which is typical for New York City. It really challenges the students.” 

The variations don't stop there:

At both UT Tyler and Hofstra, all first-year medical students complete a full emergency medical technician course. It concludes with a mass casualty simulation, which provides the chance to really practice the skills they've just learned.

“We didn't just want them to ride along in an ambulance,” Kwiatkowski said. “That's not going to provide anything more than observation. I wanted a true clinical experience.”

Limited research has been done to show exactly how realistic simulations should be, but there is some that suggests the more accurately a scenario reflects real life, the more students can benefit from it. Depending on a medical school's budget, things can get quite realistic, indeed.

For many, it includes going off-site to a training ground, where students must triage realistic victims even as they experience the chaos of an actual event.

“When they walk into a burn tower knowing that there's been an explosion, and they hear people screaming out and they can't see much, it's an environment that probably causes their heart rate to go up a little bit, perhaps their respiratory rate to go up a little bit,” said William Burke, DO, dean of Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio. “I think those types of situations help you better understand, as an individual, how you might respond in real life.”

For the simulations' victims, most schools use a combination of mannequins and volunteers — either locals or other medical students. Often, moulage artists are brought in to apply special-effects makeup.

At UT Tyler, a relatively new school, Pearl had a sizable budget to design the mass casualty training program. Faculty works with campus and local law enforcement, fire department and emergency medical services, and even the Federal Bureau of Investigation to make the event feel as real as possible for students. High-tech wound simulation includes three-dimensional printed shrapnel mounted on silicone patches that are easily applied to volunteers' bodies; bleeding systems that pump fake blood; two cut suits of repairable skin with organs that bleed — which can be operated on while actors wear them; and several mannequins with realistic injuries.

A significant amount of effort goes into creating thoughtful, plausible scenarios. A school shooting is part of the simulation at Hofstra.

“The way they set it up is hyper realistic, in that you have real police officers acting, there's a lot of yelling, it's dark, there's a lot of banging on doors. It's frankly a little bit scary,” Goodman, the medical student, said. “You really do feel like you're in a school and you have to hide but you also have to triage: Who can we get out? How are we going to get them out? Is it safe to open the door?”

Whatever the scenario, the goal in all these simulations is the same: To help medical students learn to make life-or-death decisions quickly, under extreme circumstances.

“The first minute or two, they're a little shell shocked. After that, it's like watching your children grow up,” Pearl said. “These are first- and second-year med students, and they're rocking and rolling.”

During the exercises, they must triage victims into color-coded categories. Yes, just like in The Pitt: Green goes to the walking wounded, those who need minimal help. Yellow indicates a more serious injury, but not immediately life-threatening. Red means a victim has severe injuries, but with a high potential for survival. Victims designated with a black mark are either deceased or have injuries incompatible with life.

“It's very difficult when you have to make that decision,” Kwiatkowski said. “There are a couple of maneuvers that people do before they can decide to make someone black, but sometimes you can have someone who's talking to you, and you know that you can't save them. That's an important experience for students.”

Other ethical considerations also play out. During some simulations, for instance, a school shooter is still active. Students must decide how to help children while staying safe themselves, or if and when it's worth it to risk their own lives.

At Ohio University, one situation involves a bombing. Unbeknownst to the students, the bomber is among the victims.

“Students are turning victims over and see the person playing the bomber has another bomb underneath them,” Burke said. “It helps them understand the ethics of the situation: Do you treat them the same? The answer is yes, you take care of everybody. When you ask those questions, students are thinking about things in ways they've never had to before.”

 June 11, 2025  

The United Nations Children's Fund has reported that approximately 2.7 million children younger than 1 year in Latin America have incomplete vaccination schedules. Even more concerning is the high number of “zero-dose” children — those who have never been taken to a vaccination center at all. Due to the risks this population faces, experts from the Latin American Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases are calling for increased regional attention in an article published in the journal F1000Research.

“This article is relevant because discussions around vaccination often focus solely on coverage, which may appear high, while overlooking a significant proportion of children who haven't received a single vaccine. This creates a serious risk for them, which is why it's essential to identify and prioritize them for vaccination,” said María Ávila Agüero, MD, pediatric infectious disease specialist, article author, former Minister of Health of Costa Rica, and current head of Infectious Diseases at Carlos Sáenz Herrera National Children's Hospital in San José, Costa Rica.

Operationally, zero-dose children are defined as those who have never received even a first dose of a vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis components. The article includes a series of recommendations for improving outreach to this population, based on discussions from a symposium organized by the medical society in late 2023 in Costa Rica.

Latin America lacks precise data on zero-dose populations, though between 2021 and 2022, the Americas saw a 14% reduction in their number — from 1.85 million to 1.31 million. Globally, Mexico and Brazil were among the 20 countries with the highest number of zero-dose children during that period.

In 2023, regional coverage for the first dose of the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine reached 89%. However, there are wide disparities between countries: From 65% in Venezuela to 99% in the Dominican Republic, Chile, Cuba, Costa Rica, and others.

“The COVID-19 pandemic changed everything, as resources were redirected to control it, which affected other programs — including vaccination and health education,” Ávila Agüero noted. “Although recovery is underway, it's uneven and depends heavily on the strength of each country's health ministry and public policies.”

Aurora Bautista Márquez, MD, a pediatrician with extensive public health experience and former head of the Comprehensive Child Development Division at the Mexican Social Security Institute, who did not contribute to the article, commented: “This article is both interesting and important because it reminds us of a persistent and concerning issue in the region.”

“There is a constant risk of the reemergence or outbreak of vaccine-preventable diseases,” she emphasized.

She also agreed that the pandemic significantly affected vaccination coverage: “At the start of the pandemic, basic vaccination coverage among children under 5 dropped sharply, as many parents avoided taking their children to health centers for fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection.” With the rollout of COVID vaccines, attendance at vaccination centers improved, and so did coverage rates.

“I find the data in this article very helpful, as they allow us to understand the scale of the problem in each country,” added Bautista Márquez.

The article stressed the importance of identifying and characterizing the issue in each country. Understanding who the zero-dose children are, where they live, and why they haven't been reached is essential. With these insights, countries can tailor approaches and implement effective, sustainable interventions.

In some areas, vaccine supply shortages complicate efforts. In others, access is hindered by distrust, poverty, low socioeconomic status, discrimination, or religious beliefs.

To address the problem, the authors prioritized the need for better nominal electronic vaccination records across the region. These digital tools allow for tracking vaccine data, optimizing supply distribution, and facilitating the rollout of timely, effective strategies.

Bautista Márquez agreed: “In my opinion, the most cost-effective strategy is undoubtedly the creation of nominal systems to accurately track the vaccination status of children.”

Another major point raised was the need to strengthen communication about the benefits of vaccination. Public trust in vaccines — damaged during the COVID pandemic — is a key factor in acceptance. To rebuild that trust, the article calls for evidence-based information campaigns involving community leaders, religious groups, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders.

“Involvement of healthcare workers in shaping public perception of vaccination and education about vaccines play a major role and can help prevent vaccine hesitancy,” the study authors wrote.

On this point, Ávila Agüero urged Latin American physicians not to miss any opportunity to vaccinate. She emphasized the importance of reviewing vaccination cards, approaching families with empathy and respect, addressing concerns, and not minimizing fears. Bautista Márquez added that healthcare professionals must also be well-informed about vaccine contraindications, as a lack of knowledge can lead to many missed opportunities.

Tackling inequities and ensuring that vaccination programs are equitable and reach all children — regardless of socioeconomic status, ethnicity, or geography — is a pressing task for policymakers in the region.

Vaccines must be readily available and accessible to all children, including those in remote or underserved areas and among migrant populations. The article highlights solutions such as mobile vaccination units, extended clinic hours, and outreach programs that target marginalized communities.

Bautista Márquez noted that while many of the strategies discussed are already being implemented, basic issues — like untimely vaccine supply — have resulted in many children in Mexico being unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated. “We shouldn't wait for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. That's unacceptable. Measures must be taken to prevent vaccine shortages. Investment is also needed in training and information systems to better track childhood immunization schedules across the region,” she said.

Ávila Agüero underscored the importance of political will in Latin America to mobilize resources and ensure equitable access to vaccination services. “The article expresses concern but also support for the region's health ministries. It issues a call to action at a time of heightened epidemiological risk,” she concluded.

All authors, along with Bautista Márquez and Ávila Agüero, declared having no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

 June 11, 2025  

Mailed self-collection kits and a telephone reminder helped increase cervical cancer screening (CCS) rates more than twice as much as telephone reminders for an office visit, according to new data from a randomized clinical trial in a safety-net population. The home kits paired with additional patient contact increased numbers even further.

In a trial that included 2474 people overdue for CCS (94% of them from minority populations), participants randomized to a telephone reminder with a mailed self-collection kit had 41.1% participation compared to those with a phone reminder to come in for an office visit (17.4%). CCS rates were modestly higher (46.6%) when people received contact in addition to the telephone reminder and mailed self-collection kit for testing human papillomavirus (HPV).

Self-collection with additional patient contact was designed to be different from self-collection with a telephone reminder in terms of the dose of patient interactions rather than content, minimizing potential contamination across the self-collection with telephone reminder and self-collection with additional patient contact groups.

The study, led by Jane R. Montealegre, PhD, with the Department of Behavioral Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, was conducted from February 20, 2020, to August 31, 2023, and published in JAMA Internal Medicine.

Estimates show that cervical cancer in the US could see national-level elimination in the next one to two decades if CCS rates hit 90%. However up-to-date screening has declined in recent years and was 75.2% in 2021, with rates notably lower among underserved populations, including women and people with a cervix who are uninsured or publicly insured, live in rural areas, and are from minority populations.

The study researchers noted that the results in this trial, the PRESTIS trial, are consistent with the relative participation rates of previous trials. In a recent meta-analysis of 28 trials, Stefanie Costa and colleagues reported a 2.5-fold higher participation in screening with mailed self-collection vs usual care. “Notably distinct from previous trials are the large screening proportions attained in the [self-collection (SC) group] (41.1%) and SC with patient navigation (46.6%) groups, as compared to the global estimate of 24% reported in the meta-analysis,” the authors wrote.

In an accompanying editorial, Eve Rittenberg, MD, MA, with the Division of Women's Health, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, and colleagues wrote that home self-collection “has the potential to meaningfully reduce cervical cancer burden, especially among underserved populations.”

They pointed out that self-collection has previously been studied in a clinical setting, where women can collect a sample privately without undergoing an invasive Pap smear and that “self-collected HPV samples have similar specificity and sensitivity to clinician-collected samples.” But it hasn't been known whether the tests need to be performed in a clinic.

Montealegre's team shows that “home self-collection demonstrates that people can adequately obtain usable samples in the privacy of their homes, as only 6% of samples were deemed inadequate for evaluation,” the editorialists wrote. Home-based screening, they explained, may further eliminate screening barriers for underserved populations with lower costs and fewer logistical hurdles. Additionally, screening via pelvic exam can be uncomfortable and may be culturally unacceptable for some. Pelvic exam-based screening may be particularly distressing to those who have experienced sexual trauma, they wrote.

They pointed out that options for CCS are growing with the approval last month by the FDA of a home HPV self-collection kit, which will be available for clinical use within months. Self-collection of HPV samples is included in the World Health Organization's global strategy to eliminate cervical cancer by 2030, and the draft US Preventive Services Task Force CCS guidance now includes self-collection as an option.

Future research should help determine whether more home self-collected HPV screening leads to higher rates of treating precancerous lesions and eventually lower cervical cancer rates, the editorialists wrote.

They also noted that efforts to increase CCS rates should be accompanied by efforts to increase HPV vaccination rates.

The research was funded through grants from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities and the National Cancer Institute through an MD Anderson Cancer Center Support Grant, the Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center Support Grant, and the Hollings Cancer Center Support Grant. The authors reported having no relevant financial relationships. An editorialist, Cary Gross, MD, reported receiving grants from Johnson & Johnson and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (with funding provided by AstraZeneca) outside the submitted work.

Intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF were associated with a small but significant increase in the risk for stroke among patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The risk was higher with aflibercept and bevacizumab than with ranibizumab and declined 60 days after the last injection.

“For patients with nAMD [neovascular age-related macular degeneration] in need of anti-VEGF treatment who have a history of cerebrovascular events, have atrial fibrillation or hypertension, and who are smokers, it seems prudent to try to reduce stroke risk factors,” the researchers reported.

Inger Westborg, of the Department of Clinical Sciences/Ophthalmology at Umeå University in Umeå, Sweden, was the corresponding author of this study, which was published online on June 7, 2025, in Acta Ophthalmologica.

The variations in the risk for stroke between anti-VEGF agents should be interpreted with caution, as the data could not determine whether differences were caused by confounding by indication or actual differences in risk. Information on smoking status was only available for the patients who experienced stroke.

This study received support through a grant from Region Stockholm, Sweden. One author disclosed serving as an advisory board member for various pharmaceutical companies.

In a cohort of 157,332 in the Veterans Health Administration with atrial fibrillation (AF), Black patients had a 14% higher risk for stroke than White patients, but Black, Asian, and Hispanic patients were less likely than White patients to die from stroke.

“Our findings of higher rates of stroke in Black patients, even when controlling for anticoagulant use, suggest that there are other mechanisms by which stroke prevention must be addressed in ongoing VA quality improvement efforts for AF. These include improving equitable access to all AF treatment strategies beyond anticoagulation, including rhythm control agents and therapeutic procedures such as cardiac ablation, for which notable disparities have been observed,” the researchers reported. “Furthermore, our observation that the magnitude of the association between race and stroke decreased with the addition of socioeconomic markers in our stepwise modeling suggests that addressing social factors and structural determinants beyond the health system may improve downstream AF outcomes.”

The study was led by Utibe R. Essien, MD, MPH, of the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Leslie R.M.

CHICAGO — The antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) pivekimab sunirine (PVEK) yielded high response rates with good durability in patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) in the phase 1/2 CADENZA trial.

“We conclude that PVEK represents a potentially practice-changing paradigm for patients with the rare disease BPDCN,” said study author Naveen Pemmaraju, MD, of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, during an oral abstract session at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2025 annual meeting. “One half of first-line patients treated with PVEK subsequently received stem cell transplant. PVEK treatment had a manageable safety profile, and infusion-related reactions and peripheral edema were resolved with supportive care. No capillary leak syndrome [CLS] was observed.”

CADENZA enrolled 84 adult patients with CD123-positive BPDCN. Of these patients, 33 were newly diagnosed, and 51 patients had relapsed or refractory (R/R) BPDCN with one, two, or three prior lines of therapy. In the first-line group, 22 patients had de novo disease, and 11 had a prior or concomitant hematologic malignancy (PCHM).

CADENZA's primary endpoint was the composite rate of complete response (CR) plus CR with minimal skin abnormality in the first-line de novo patients.

The authors found that 70% of patients achieved the composite CR, while 14% of the patients with R/R did. Regarding the overall response rate, 85% of first-line patients responded to PVEK, while 35% of patients with R/R responded.

Responses among patients with R/R were early and durable (median, 1.4 months and 9.2 months, respectively).

PCHM status did not affect overall survival (OS) in first-line patients: Median OS was 16.6 months in both the de novo and PCHM subgroups.

The discussant for this study, Raajit Rampal, MD, PhD, of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, told Medscape Medical News that the CADENZA trial supports the use of CD123 as a therapeutic target in BPDCN. He also noted that the current standard of care often causes potentially life-threatening CLS: “There were no cases of CLS in this dataset, which means we may have an opportunity to deliver anti-CD123 therapies with no CLS as a potential side effect.”

Rampal also cited PVEK's apparent ability to enable many patients to bridge to stem cell transplant, “the fundamental prospect in terms of long-term survival provisions with BPDCN.”

Following this presentation, Pemmaraju sat down with Medscape Medical News. The following interview has been edited for clarity.

Please give us some context on BPDCN and why it is difficult to treat.

BPDCN is a rare, aggressive hematological malignancy primarily involving skin, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and the central nervous system. We think there are only 500 BPDCN diagnoses per year in the US. Current treatment regimens are limited to chemotherapy regimens adapted from acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. The median age at diagnosis is around 65 years, so many patients are not eligible for intensive chemo or stem cell transplants. CD123 is overexpressed on all BPDCN blasts, making it an ideal target for immunochemotherapy.

What is the top takeaway from your presentation?

BPDCN has an overall poor prognosis with significant unmet need. Currently, tagraxofusp-erzs is the standard of care and the only approved treatment for BPDCN. PVEK is a new CD123-targeting agent. This novel monotherapy, given once every 3 weeks, had high response rates for frontline patients with BPDCN and was highly durable. Even for patients with R/R, whose prognosis is only a few months, PVEK showed some promising activity both in response and durability.

Patients with BPDCN are in need of improved frontline therapies to treat their disease, so we're very excited to see this phase 1/2 trial going extremely well in terms of safety and efficacy. The responses we have observed make PVEK a strong candidate as a standard-of-care treatment.

What is another important thing you want your colleagues to know about this study?

The CADENZA trial enrolled 84 patients, which is a huge number in a rare disease field like ours. I'm proud we were able to achieve a real-world demographic split. That means we had older patients, just like I see in the clinic, and half the patients had skin involvement along with bone marrow. In the relapsed group, the prior therapy had been quite intense. Half of these patients had received chemo, half had received tagraxofusp, and a third had received a transplant. This may be the best study I've ever done in terms of enrolling patients who are truly representative with all the comorbidities and all the difficulties you see in clinical practice.

You mentioned that PVEK is more patient-friendly than the standard of care. Why is that?

PVEK is given once every 3 weeks via an infusion that takes only 30 minutes or less. Many of our other drugs, of course, require a much more intensive schedule that can be difficult for patients, especially when they must be given on an inpatient basis. PVEK can be given outpatient even from the beginning, which is much more convenient for patients.

You referred several times to patients' skin lesions. Is that part of the BPDCN disease process, or is that a treatment reaction?

I want to emphasize this is a BPDCN trait not related to treatment. BPDCN has a predilection for the skin. The vast majority of patients with BPDCN, anywhere from 70% to 90%, will present with skin findings. It's very common for my patients to present with “just” a skin lesion that turns out to be anything but. Unlike other skin-containing malignancies, BPDCN is a bone marrow blood cancer that can go to an acute leukemia and become acutely life-threatening. Let's differentiate that from the cutaneous toxicity very commonly seen in chemo-based regimens.

What's ahead in PVEK research?

We will keep presenting our data, including at the European Hematology Association and as an ASCO Encore presentation. We hope to submit PVEK to regulatory agencies in the near future. Ultimately, can we combine PVEK with other agents active in the AML and BPDCN space to create a next-generation therapy? Eventually, once we have two active agents for BPDCN, we will need to determine the sequencing of these drugs. What's the natural history of these treated patients? Are they living longer? I think answers to all those questions will come out in the coming year or 2.

 June 11, 2025  

CHICAGO — The anticipated release of 5-year overall survival (OS) data from the CARTITUDE-1 trial showed that the use of ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) met or exceeded expectations.

“We already knew from our initial publication that 98% of patients who got cilta-cel responded to therapy and that the majority of those responses were complete responses. We also knew that the median PFS [progression-free survival] was approximately 34 months, which is unheard of in this patient population,” said study author Peter Voorhees, MD, of Atrium Health/Levine Cancer Institute, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Charlotte, North Carolina, during an oral abstract session at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2025 annual meeting.

“Today we are sharing that the median OS is just over 5 years, and that one third of the study population has remained progression-free following a single cilta-cel infusion with no maintenance therapy.”

These findings were simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

CARTITUDE-1 is a phase 1B/2 trial in which 97 patients with four or more prior lines of treatment for RRMM received cilta-cel. Of these patients, 45 are currently alive and in long-term follow-up in the CARTinue 15-year post-infusion study. This group is further broken down among 32 patients who have remained progression-free since their infusion and 13 patients who had progressive disease and are now in post-progressive disease follow-up.

Of the progression-free patients, 12 from a single center with annual minimal residual disease (MRD) testing remain MRD-negative at year 5 or longer.

Voorhees noted that long-term remissions were not limited to patients with standard-risk disease. “Patients with high-risk cytogenetics like del17p, t(14;16) or t(4;14) and those with extramedullary plasmacytomas were equally likely to be progression-free,” he said.

The study team also found that patients in long-term remission had more immune-fit drug products and higher effector to target ratios at peak expansion, Voorhees said.

The discussant for this study, Krina K. Patel, MD, MSc, of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston told attendees that the CARTITUDE-1 OS data were “phenomenal for these hard-to-treat patients” as she reshared Voorhees' PFS slide showing a plateau extending toward 78 months.

“I do hope this plateau continues forever for these 33% of patients, to the point where we can say it's a true cure,” Patel said. “But I don't hold my breath because most of my patients do relapse at some point.”

Patel also noted the limitation that CARTITUDE-1 is a single-arm study. “We know there's CARTITUDE-4, so we have randomized data that shows better performance than at least a couple of our standard care options,” she said. “But it is hard to compare historical controls.”

Following this presentation, Voorhees sat down with Medscape Medical News. The following interview has been edited for clarity.

Since FDA approval of cilta-cel was based on CARTITUDE-1, the expectation was that longer-term data would also be very good. Why are these long-term OS results from CARTITUDE-1 so important?

The median overall survival wound up being just over 5 years, when we would have expected it to be 1 year in a similar population. One third of the patients are alive and in remission, and they've been off therapy for 5 years, which is something we've never seen before. Just as importantly, we're not seeing new safety signals, and the rates of high-grade infection seem to be declining further out from treatment, which is what we would expect with immune recovery.

Is it time to start thinking of myeloma as a potentially curable disease?

I'm always very cautious when I discuss that. Possibly there may be patients who never relapse, but I am curious to see how these next 5 years play out because if the majority of these patients remain in remission 10 years out from cilta-cel infusion, then I'll be using the word “cure” less cautiously at that time.

We do talk a lot about functional cures in multiple myeloma: For someone newly diagnosed with standard-risk disease, they will get a three or four drug induction therapy, then a transplant followed by maintenance therapy. A lot of these patients will stay in remission well beyond 10 years and they'll pass away at an older age of unrelated causes.

What do the new CARTITUDE-1 data do to the paradigm of continuous therapy?

The other thing that has made us hesitate about using the word “cure” in myeloma is the traditional paradigm of continuous treatment. What happens to patients in remission when you stop therapy? Are they in a long-term remission because you're keeping the heat on the disease or are they cured and what you're applying to them continuously is unnecessary? What makes the cilta-cel 5-year data so compelling is that these patients got that single infusion and a third of them are still in remission 5 years later.

Your ASCO presentation included a discussion of MRD level at 10−5 vs 10−6. Why is that important here?

Currently the best that's available as far as regular clinical practice is concerned is a 10−6 but MRD negativity is often reported at 10−5. But as so many people going through CAR T-cell therapy achieve MRD negativity at 10−5, the 10−6 level of sensitivity seems to be a better way of distinguishing those patients that might be at higher risk for disease progression vs those that are not. You're going to see us transitioning more toward using MRD negativity at 10−6 for our clinical trials going forward.

What's ahead for the CARTITUDE research program? 

The expectation is the earlier you use a highly effective therapy, the better it's going to perform. We have the CARTITUDE-4 study, which compares cilta-cel with standard of care in both standard-risk and high-risk disease. CARTITUDE-5 and CARTITUDE-6 are both phase 3 studies looking at the application of cilta-cel therapy for newly diagnosed myeloma patients. For CARTITUDE-5, we're looking to see if adding cilta-cel after lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone will improve outcomes for patients not eligible to receive an upfront transplant. And in CARTITUDE-6, we're looking to see if cilta-cel can be used instead of autologous stem cell transplantation as consolidation for younger, fitter patients with newly diagnosed myeloma. And if things go the way we expect them to, we may be starting to use that word cure more often.

When did it really hit you that the cilta-cel data are better than anything else that has yet happened? 

We've got several patients from CARTITUDE-1 at our institution who are still in complete remission, and they've lived a normal life for years now. We have patients on the CARTITUDE-2 program who are also long-term responders, so we see this in our everyday practice more and more. If you had told me 10 years ago that this is what we would be doing, I would've thought there's no way. But here we are doing it.

 June 11, 2025  

The World Health Organization (WHO) has launched a new European commission aimed at providing health sector solutions to what it called one of the defining health challenges of our time: climate change. 

The Pan-European Commission on Climate and Health (PECCH) is an independent advisory group convened by WHO Europe that brings together 11 commissioners from across the region, with Sir Andrew Haines of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine as the chief scientific advisor. The commission will deliver recommendations that address the intersection of health and climate. 

At a press briefing today in Reykjavík, Iceland, PECCH chair, former Icelandic Prime Minister Her Excellency Katrín Jakobsdóttir said that although climate change has been a big issue in global politics for decades, not enough has been done.

“We've seen too many reports and not enough action,” she said. “I know it's difficult to implement policy on climate change, [but] we will be focused on what actually can be done. I'm optimistic that we will deliver concrete recommendations.” 

Europe is the fastest warming continent in the world, with 2024 the warmest year on record, according to the European Environment Agency. Extreme weather events have caused up to 145,000 deaths across Europe in the past 40 years, with a majority caused by heatwaves. The changing climate also continues to alter the distribution of disease vectors, with the expansion of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, and to impact food systems, water quality, and ecosystems.

Despite the growing threat posed by climate change, action — including within the health sector — remains inadequate to match the level of response required. PECCH will attempt to address the health impacts of climate change by determining interconnected health risks and opportunities for health improvement through adaptation and mitigation strategies, identifying gaps in government actions and policies, recommending strategies for action, increasing awareness on the role of health in climate policy, and advising the WHO. 

Professor of health systems research at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia and founding director of the Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Jeffrey Braithwaite, PhD, told Medscape Medical News he believed the new commission holds a lot of promise. 

“It seems designed to help raise more awareness, with some jurisdictions, companies and institutions flagging a bit under the weight of disinformation,” said Braithwaite, who is past president of the International Society for Quality in Health Care. 

“The US, under the current White House, is of course hostile to the climate change agenda, so a lot of heavy political lifting and keeping the agenda for change going will fall to Europe.” 

Professor of population and planetary health at the University of Notre Dame, Sydney, Australia, Lynne Madden, MBBS, MPH, MSc, said addressing climate change and health requires a systems approach to a very complex problem.

“It appears that the commission is planning to take a systems approach and look at the interconnected global and regional risks to health to form recommendations to achieve a health net zero emission future. This is encouraging,” she told Medscape Medical News.

“Europe is probably the region most likely to make a commission like this work. What we don't need is more meetings that produce informed statements but very little real action that tackles climate change and its health effects. The big question is: Beyond the rhetoric, will the commission be able to do anything now that hasn't been done before to make national governments take meaningful action to halt climate change?” 

She added that it was critical to increase the climate resilience of healthcare systems, commit to delivering net zero healthcare and preferably zero carbon healthcare, develop the climate health capacity of healthcare workforces, and ensure the education of health professionals on the health impacts of climate change and give them the competency to take action, including eliminating the delivery of unnecessary healthcare. 

Others agreed it was time for the health sector to step up and to take accountability and action for its own carbon footprint, with the sector contributing roughly 5% of global emissions — more than all commercial air travel. 

“Healthcare has a major impact on the environment, and it is one area where we see simultaneous cost savings along with most sustainability interventions. I like this because there is less tension, and politics can align better with ‘this will save money and help the environment' rather than ‘this will cost money,'” Kayvan Shokrollahi, MBBS, MSc, LLM, consultant plastic and laser surgeon and honorary clinical professor at the University of Liverpool, United Kingdom, told Medscape Medical News. 

He recently conducted a carbon footprint study of his burn center to identify aspects of burn care that contribute most to the carbon footprint and wastage and to explore interventions to help reduce waste. He and his colleagues found that hospitals and surgical clinics are the second largest waste contributors in the UK, generating more than 6600 tons of waste per day. Current waste disposal practices such as incineration, landfilling, and sterilization post environmental threats. At the same time, up to 1 billion liters of water a year are wasted by running taps across the NHS pumping network to flush Pseudomonas and Legionella in the absence of other alternative solutions.

“Our research demonstrated a rough extrapolation of £2 million of savings from reduced plastic waste from one intervention whilst also saving 150 tons of CO2. Progress in healthcare sustainability is a case of implementing large numbers of simple cumulative interventions, not one big one.”

Braithwaite cited his and his colleagues' recent systematic review on strategies and tactics that could be used to reduce the impact of healthcare on climate change, of which they developed a framework to support the decarbonization of healthcare systems. Such strategies included changing clinical and surgical practices, reducing physical waste, and enabling change through actions of individuals and groups. 

Looking forward, the PECCH will engage with representatives from other regions to work together on shared solutions. Its final recommendations for health and climate action will be presented during the World Health Assembly next May. 

Braithwaite, Madden, and Shokrollahi reported no relevant financial relationships.

Memory problems have long been considered the primary hallmark of dementia, but a team of researchers is now challenging this view. They argue that changes in sensory perception – from vision to balance – may be equally important indicators that many healthcare providers are currently missing.

According to experts, current approaches to the care and support of people with dementia need an overhaul, relying too heavily on the assessment of memory functions, when the condition also impairs taste, touch, balance, hearing, or vision.

Professor Andrea Tales, Professor of Dementia Research at Swansea University, Dr. Emma Richards of Public Health Wales (formally Swansea University) and Professor Jan Kremláček, head of Medical Biophysics LFHK at Charles University, who are all experts in dementia research say substantial evidence now supports the existence of sensory and perceptual changes for some people living with dementia.

The experts lay out the body of evidence supporting this shift in understanding in A New Approach to Dementia.

Importantly, this book is co-produced by people living with dementia and sensory/perceptual challenges, facilitated by Aimee Day and Paula Brown. This group of co-researchers has navigated their own sensory and memory challenges to provide the context of human experience to the academic research. 

The lesser-known characteristics of dementia for some individuals include abnormalities such as altered visual and hearing perception, changes in hearing ability and sound processing, especially in noisy environments, diminished sense of smell and taste, and tactile sensitivity issues. These changes in sensory and perceptual processing may accompany the more commonly recognized memory problems associated with conditions like Alzheimer's disease.

Dr. Emma Richards, who works with individuals living with dementia, notes: ""Many patients report experiencing these sensory changes years before receiving a diagnosis, but these symptoms may be overlooked during standard cognitive assessments.

""Understanding and addressing these issues, and providing support earlier could be transformative, enabling health care providers to offer the vital emotional and social support patients need at a potentially confusing and distressing time. In addition to this, understanding changes in a person's senses can help support a clinician in determining a dementia diagnosis.""

This emerging understanding has significant implications for clinical practice and caregiving. The authors suggest that incorporating comprehensive sensory and perceptual testing into standard diagnostic, care, support and management protocols could enable a better understanding of the experience of the person living with dementia and their signs and symptoms, lead to a more targeted or personalised approaches, help maintain independence, and thus improve the quality of life for people living with dementia.

""Broadening the diagnostic approach beyond memory testing raised the potential to identify dementia at preclinical stages when therapies and life modifications may be most effective,"" says Professor Jan Kremláček, who specializes in neurophysiological assessment.

Sensory and perceptual changes can be hugely detrimental to everyday functioning and quality of life. Individuals living with dementia may experience increased difficulty navigating familiar environments, challenges with reading and interpreting visual information, communication difficulties due to auditory processing issues, and heightened anxiety in complex sensory environments.

Healthcare providers are being encouraged to listen more carefully when patients report subtle changes in how they perceive and interact with their environment, as disruption in sensory function and perception may be manifestations of dementia.

This includes developing standardized protocols for assessing sensory and perceptual function, training healthcare providers to recognize non-memory symptoms, designing environments and interventions that accommodate sensory changes, and including sensory assessments in routine cognitive screening.

""This isn't about replacing memory assessment, but rather expanding our toolkit to improve our capture of the full, more holistic, spectrum of dementia-related changes,"" explains Professor Tales.

Could a simple fiber supplement curb hunger and keep insulin in check? New research finds that this mineral-rich blend helps people feel fuller without raising blood sugar levels.

Study: Impact of a mineral enriched, fiber complex on glycaemic response and satiation in healthy adults: a double-blind, crossover intervention study. Image Credit: superbeststock / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the European Journal of Nutrition, researchers investigated the effects of a mineral-enriched fiber complex on satiation and glycemic response. Obesity and overweight have become a significant global health concern and pose substantial economic challenges to global healthcare systems. Excessive fat accumulation is a significant risk factor for various metabolic disorders. Weight gain in early adulthood is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and CVD mortality, compared to that in later life. This suggests the need for early interventions to support weight management and alleviate risks.

Efforts to maintain a healthy weight can be challenging. Recent anti-obesity strategies have been revolutionized by glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists. However, these interventions often have undesirable effects, such as diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. Therefore, given the risks, limitations, and suitability of pharmaceutical approaches, functional foods and supplements could be a beneficial alternative.

In the present study, researchers investigated the impact of chromium-enriched glucomannan-fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) complex, i.e., SlimBiome (SB), intake on satiety and glycemic response in healthy adults. This randomized, crossover intervention trial recruited healthy adults aged 18–65, with normal fasting glucose levels and body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 kg/m² and 24.9 kg/m². Subjects made three visits to the laboratory.

The first was a screening and familiarization visit. Blood pressure, body fat percentage, and anthropometric indices were measured at the first visit. Participants were required to fast for 12 hours before each visit and refrain from consuming large meals and alcohol the previous day. Visits 2 and 3 were completed in a randomized order with a washout period of at least two days between them. A modified oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at visits 2 and 3.

Blood was collected to measure fasting glucose and insulin levels. Participants consumed a dextrose drink at visit 2 or an SB plus dextrose (SBD) drink at visit 3, following which blood samples were collected at several time points (up to 2.5 hours) after intake. In addition, participants completed a questionnaire on subjective measures of appetite at 0 (baseline), 75, and 150 minutes post-intake; responses were recorded on the visual analog scale (VAS).

A rapid viscoanalyzer was used to assess the viscosity kinetics of SB, SBD, and dextrose under gastric pH conditions. The area under the curve for insulin (AUCins) and glucose (AUCglu) was calculated. Further, insulin sensitivity was calculated using the Matsuda and Cederholm indices. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed to examine differences in insulin and glucose levels between the interventions (SBD and dextrose).

The study recruited eight females and eight males. Blood glucose levels remained unchanged and were not significantly different between dextrose and SBD conditions at any time during OGTT. Notably, plasma insulin levels were significantly lower 45, 75, and 90 minutes after SBD intake compared to those after dextrose intake. Importantly, early insulin response (within 30 minutes) showed no significant difference between interventions. AUCins was significantly lower with SBD compared to dextrose, but AUCglu was not significantly different between conditions.

Glucose levels were significantly higher at 75 minutes and lower at 150 minutes post-intake than at baseline in both conditions. Meanwhile, insulin levels were higher at 75 minutes than at baseline with both interventions. Insulin values at baseline and 150 minutes were not different with either intervention.

Baseline VAS scores did not differ significantly between the dextrose and SBD conditions. However, significant increases were observed over time in the amount of food desired and hunger between baseline and 150 minutes upon dextrose intake. On the other hand, SBD intake significantly increased fullness 75 minutes post-intake.

Crucially, at 150 minutes post-intake (but not earlier), subjects reported being significantly less hungry and fuller with SBD than with dextrose across all appetite metrics (including desire to eat and amount of food desired). SBD and SB attained maximum viscosity between 15 and 20 minutes and stabilized thereafter. The viscosity of dextrose was significantly lower than that of SBD and SB. However, there were no differences between SB and SBD.

The researchers noted that chromium levels (15 µg/dose) were likely too low to drive effects, suggesting benefits primarily stem from fibers' viscosity-related mechanisms. As an acute study, long-term effects remain unexplored.

In summary, SBD significantly reduced insulin levels at 45, 75, and 90 minutes, as well as AUCins at 150 minutes post-intake, compared to dextrose, without affecting glucose levels. This underscores the potential beneficial impact of SB on postprandial insulin response. SBD intake resulted in later-occurring (150 min) lower sensations of hunger and increased fullness. These findings offer valuable insights and suggest the potential use of SB in weight management strategies, though longer-term studies are needed to confirm effects.

Developmentally expressed genes play a fundamental role in the formation of a wide range of organs. The Y chromosome-located mammalian sex-determining gene Sry, required for the formation of testis, is activated only within a narrow time window during embryogenesis. However, the processes behind the activation of Sry remain uncertain.

Now, in a recent publication from Nature, a team from The University of Osaka has discovered that iron plays a crucial role in male mammalian sex development.

The Sry gene directs sexually undifferentiated gonads to differentiate into testes rather than ovaries. The Sry gene is initially inactive because of a modification added to DNA-wrapping proteins called histone methylation. In males, a protein called KDM3A is responsible for removing this histone methylation, allowing the Sry gene to become active.

We already knew that KDM3A requires iron for its enzymatic activity. Therefore, we wanted to investigate the extent and nature of iron metabolism and histone demethylation in sex determination.""

Naoki Okashita, lead author

The researchers established mice lacking Tfrc, a gene crucial for cellular iron incorporation. Loss of Tfrc prevented the removal of the histone methylation, leading to reduced Sry expression. When inspecting the genitals of these mice, it was found that some XY mice developed as female, despite being genetically male.

The team also established an organ culture system for gonadal cells in which they could manipulate the levels of available iron. This confirmed that iron deficiency reduces the activity of KDM3A and activation of Sry. Therefore, the reduced Sry suppression under iron-deficient conditions was caused by the failure of KDM3A to remove histone methylation.

Perhaps most significantly, they then showed that maternal iron deficiency - whether induced by diet or by pharmacological intervention - could lead to altered histone methylation of the Sry gene because of reduced KDM3A activity. Some population of XY offspring derived from iron-deficient pregnant females were shown to undergo male-to-female sex reversal, potentially due to the impaired Sry activation.

""Our findings indicate that iron deficiency leads to disorders of male development, at least in mice. Our study emphasizes the importance of maintaining maternal iron levels,"" explains senior author, Makoto Tachibana.

It is known that in humans, Fanconi anemia and Diamond-Blackfan anemia are risk factors for disorders of development. Understanding how iron supports embryonic development underscores the importance of maternal iron intake for the healthy development of human embryos.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Difficult childhood experiences linked to increased risk of endometriosis later in life","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/Difficult-childhood-experiences-linked-to-increased-risk-of-endometriosis-later-in-life.aspx","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 11:15:00 GMT","

A new study from Karolinska Institutet involving over a million women links difficult childhood experiences to the risk of being diagnosed with endometriosis later in life. The study shows a link between childhood exposure to violence and a twofold increase in the risk of developing this gynecological disease.

Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. These cells attach to the abdominal lining, uterus, ovaries or other organs and form endometriosis lesions. The lesions react to sex hormones and bleed during menstruation, leading to pain and inflammation that can cause adhesions between organs, which increases the pain.

Although endometriosis, which affects one in ten women, is a relatively common disease, its causes are still not fully understood. A new study published in the journal Human Reproduction has now identified a link between different types of difficult childhood experiences and an increased risk of developing endometriosis.

The study included more than 1.3 million women born in Sweden between 1974 and 2001. Of these, more than 24,000 were diagnosed with endometriosis. The researchers used data from several national registers to map the women's childhood conditions. Factors such as having parents with mental illness, substance abuse, financial problems or intellectual disabilities, having a teenage parent, death in the family, and being exposed to or subjected to violence and sexual abuse were examined.

The results showed that all factors examined, except death in the family, were linked to an increased risk of endometriosis. Experiencing any of these risk factors was linked to a 20 per cent increased risk of endometriosis diagnosis compared to women who had not been exposed.

We also saw that the more adverse experiences in childhood, the higher the risk. Among those who had five or more factors, the risk increased to 60 per cent.""

Marika Rostvall, study's first author, physician and doctoral student at the Department of Global Public Health, Karolinska Institutet

The strongest link was observed in children who had been exposed to violence. These children had more than twice the risk of developing endometriosis later in life compared to women who had not been exposed.

""The results suggest that early life experiences can affect the body's health much later in life and highlight the importance of looking at the whole person, not just the symptoms. The findings are also in line with previous research showing that difficulties in childhood have profound consequences for future health,"" says Marika Rostvall.

Research has not yet established the link between difficult childhood experiences and endometriosis, but Marika Rostvall highlights two possible explanations.

""One explanation is that stress during childhood can affect the immune system, which could prevent it from effectively eliminating endometriosis tissue.

Another explanation is that trauma during childhood could affect the body's sensitivity to pain, which can lead to increased pain and thus a higher likelihood of being diagnosed with endometriosis,"" says Marika Rostvall, continuing:

""I hope that the findings can be used to improve both preventive measures and treatment in healthcare.

As the study is observational, it is not possible to draw conclusions about causal relationships.

The study is a collaboration between Karolinska Institutet and the Centre for Epidemiology and Community Medicine (CES), Region Stockholm. The study was funded by Karolinska Institutet and Region Stockholm. Kristina Gemzell-Danielsson has been invited as an expert and speaker to several companies unrelated to the current study.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Targeting metabolic reprogramming in breast cancer treatment","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/Targeting-metabolic-reprogramming-in-breast-cancer-treatment.aspx","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 07:05:00 GMT","

Breast cancer remains the most prevalent malignancy among women worldwide, posing a critical challenge to global health. Amid the complexities of this disease, an emerging focus on metabolic reprogramming has shed light on novel treatment avenues. A newly published review delves into the intricate alterations in glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism that drive breast cancer progression and explores promising therapeutic strategies designed to exploit these metabolic dependencies.

Cancer cells demonstrate a heightened energy metabolism, favoring glycolysis even in oxygen-rich environments—a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. This metabolic shift provides cancer cells with a rapid energy supply while fueling their growth and survival. At the same time, breast cancer cells exhibit an increased demand for glutamine, an essential nutrient that supports tumor proliferation. The ability of these cells to synthesize, uptake, and metabolize glutamine has become a focal point in the search for targeted treatments that disrupt this dependency.

Lipid metabolism also plays a crucial role in breast cancer progression, influencing metastasis and drug resistance. Lipids serve as both an energy source and signaling molecules that modulate tumor behavior. Emerging evidence suggests that targeting lipid metabolic pathways could open new avenues for intervention, particularly in aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which currently lacks effective targeted therapies.

As research continues to uncover the metabolic intricacies of breast cancer, the potential for precision medicine grows. The review highlights key metabolic targets, including enzymes and transport proteins that regulate nutrient uptake and utilization. However, the challenge remains in translating these findings into clinically effective therapies. While metabolic inhibitors have shown promise, their real-world application faces hurdles such as drug resistance, off-target effects, and patient variability.

The integration of metabolism and immunotherapy has also emerged as a compelling strategy. By modulating metabolic pathways, researchers aim to enhance the immune system's ability to recognize and attack cancer cells. This interdisciplinary approach holds promise for more effective and personalized treatment regimens.

Scientists have discovered that certain immune cells — called neutrophils — can start making a protein called DUOX2 that they usually do not produce. This surprise activity may be fuelling gut inflammation in conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

The international study led by Professor Ulla Knaus, UCD School of Medicine and UCD Conway Institute shows this unusual protein production might damage the intestine and make these diseases worse. These surprise findings may lead to a new target for treating inflammatory bowel disease in the future.

Neutrophils are immune cells. They usually help fight infections by attacking bacteria and cleaning up damaged tissues.

DUOX2 is a protein that creates chemicals to repel germs but can also damage the body if there is too much of it. Normally, neutrophils do not contain DUOX2 but in people with gut disease, some neutrophils start making this protein (called 'de novo' expression).

Our findings show that the new DUOX2 protein can lead to too many reactive chemicals being produced, which causes inflammation in the gut. This makes the disease worse. The gut can get more irritated, leading to more pain, diarrhoea, and long-term problems. If we can stop neutrophils from making DUOX2 or discover inhibitors, it might help clinicians to treat gut inflammation in the future.""

Dr. Ashish Singh, postdoctoral researcher and first author

Prof. Knaus said, ""Interestingly, we have seen early indications in our research that neutrophil DUOX may also be a promising therapeutic target in acute inflammation across other organs as well. This presents a breakthrough for drug discovery in neutrophil-driven inflammatory diseases.""

This international collaboration included University of California; the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, U.S.A. as well as academic and clinical colleagues across Ireland. The research findings are published online in the scientific journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2421747122).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Four ways Trump's ‘one big beautiful bill' would undermine access to Obamacare","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/Four-ways-Trumpe28099s-e28098one-big-beautiful-bille28099-would-undermine-access-to-Obamacare.aspx","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 10:40:00 GMT","

Major changes could be in store for the more than 24 million people with health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, including how and when they can enroll, the paperwork required, and, crucially, the premiums they pay.

A driver behind these changes is the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" the name given to spending and tax legislation designed to advance the policy agenda of President Donald Trump. It passed the House on May 22 and is pending in the Senate.

The changes also would come from regulations the Trump administration proposed in March and the potential expiration of larger premium subsidies put in place during the covid-19 pandemic.

Millions of people might drop or lose coverage by 2034 as a result, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

Combined, the moves by Trump and his allies could ""devastate access"" to ACA plans, said Katie Keith, director of the Center for Health Policy and the Law at the O'Neill Institute, a health policy research group at Georgetown University.

States that run their own Obamacare marketplaces and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners have also raised concerns about added costs and reduced access. But House Republicans and some conservative think tanks say the ACA needs revamping to rein in fraud, part of which they pin on certain Biden administration changes the measures would undo.

Senate Republicans must now weigh whether to include the House's proposals in their own bill, with the aim of getting it through the chamber by July 4.

Here are four key ways Trump's policies could undermine Obamacare enrollment and coverage.

The House-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which runs more than 1,000 pages, would create paperwork requirements that could delay access to tax credits for some enrollees, potentially raising the cost of their insurance.

More than 90% of ACA enrollees receive tax credits to defray monthly premiums for their coverage. There are two key provisions for them to watch.

One would end automatic reenrollment for most ACA policyholders each year. More than 10 million people were automatically reenrolled in their coverage for the 2025 plan year, with their eligibility for tax credits confirmed via a system that allows ACA marketplaces to check government or other data sources.

The House bill would instead require every new or returning policyholder each year to provide information on income, household size, immigration status, and other factors, starting in 2028. If they don't, they won't get a premium tax credit, which could put the price of coverage out of reach.

""Everyone who wants to either purchase or renew a marketplace plan will have to come with a shoebox filled with documents, scan in and upload them or mail them in, and sit and wait while someone reviews and confirms them,"" said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.

She and other policy experts fear that many consumers will become uninsured because they don't understand the requirements or find them burdensome. If too many young and healthy people, for example, decide it's not worth the hassle, that could leave more older and sicker people for ACA insurers to cover — potentially raising premiums for everyone.

But supporters of the House bill say the current approach needs changing because it is vulnerable to waste, fraud, and abuse.

""This would ensure that enrollees need to return to the exchange to update their information and obtain an updated eligibility determination for a subsidy — best protecting the public against excess subsidies paid to insurers that can never be recovered,"" the conservative Paragon Institute wrote in an April letter to top Department of Health and Human Services officials.

Today, people who experience life changes — losing a job, getting married or divorced, or having a baby, for instance — are considered provisionally eligible for tax credits to reduce their premiums if they sign up or change their ACA plans. That means they would be eligible to receive these subsidies for at least 90 days while their applications are checked against government data or other sources, or marketplaces follow up with requests for additional information.

The House bill would end that, requiring documentation before receiving tax credits. That could create particular hardship for new parents, who can't confirm that babies are eligible for premium subsidies until they receive Social Security numbers weeks after they're born.

Policy experts following the debate ""did not expect the end to provisional eligibility,"" Corlette said. ""I don't know what the reaction in the Senate will be, as I'm not sure everyone understands the full implications of these provisions because they are so new.""

It can take up to six weeks for the Social Security Administration to process a number for a newborn, and an additional two weeks for parents to get the card, according to a white paper that analyzed provisions of the House bill and was co-authored by Jason Levitis, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, and Christen Linke Young, a visiting fellow with Brookings' Center on Health Policy.

Without a Social Security number, any application to add a newborn to an ACA policy would automatically generate a hold on premium tax credits for that family, they wrote — increasing their out-of-pocket costs, at least temporarily.

""It puts consumers on the hook for any delays the marketplace is taking,"" while the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which administers the ACA marketplaces, ""is cutting staff and adding a lot more paperwork to burden the staff they have,"" Levitis said.

Provisions in the House bill that would require ACA enrollees to provide information each year that they reenroll — or when seeking to add or change a policy due to a life circumstance — would increase the number of people without health insurance by 700,000 in 2034, according to the latest CBO estimate.

The House bill would turn into law a Trump proposal to shorten the ACA open enrollment period. The start date would continue to be Nov. 1. But the window would be shortened by about a month, with an end date of Dec. 15. This affects people in states that use the federal marketplace as well as the 19 states and the District of Columbia that run their own, most of which offer open enrollment into at least mid-January.

Also, as soon as the end of this year, a special enrollment period the Biden administration created would be done away with. It allowed people with lower incomes — those who earn up to 1.5 times the 2024 federal poverty level, or about $38,730 for a family of three — to sign up anytime during the year.

Critics, including the Paragon Institute, argue that this enrollment opening led to fraud, partly blaming it for a steep increase last year in instances of insurance agents seeking commissions by enrolling or switching consumers into plans without their consent, or fudging their incomes to qualify them for tax credits so large they paid no monthly premiums at all.

But supporters — including some states that run their own ACA exchange — say there are other ways to address fraud.

""We anticipate that much of the improper activity can be prevented by security and integrity upgrades to the federal marketplace, which we understand the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is implementing,"" the National Association of Insurance Commissioners wrote in a May 29 letter to congressional leaders.

The reason? Enhanced tax credits created during the pandemic expire at the end of the year. The House bill doesn't extend them. Those more generous payments are credited with helping double ACA enrollment since 2020.

The CBO estimates that extending the subsidies would cost $335 billion over 10 years. The House bill instead funds an extension of Trump's tax cuts, which largely benefit wealthier families.

If the enhanced credits are allowed to expire, not only would premium subsidies be smaller for many people, but there would also be an abrupt eligibility cutoff — an income cliff — for households above four times the federal poverty rate, or about $103,280 for a family of three for this plan year.

Taking into account the smaller subsidies and the cliff, KFF estimates a national average premium increase of 75% for enrollees if the enhanced subsidies expire. The CBO expects that about 4.2 million more people will be uninsured in 2034 as a result.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Legal environment shapes doctors' preferences for assisted dying","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/Legal-environment-shapes-doctorse28099-preferences-for-assisted-dying.aspx","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 16:59:00 GMT","

When it comes to advanced cancer or Alzheimer's disease, over half of doctors would consider assisted dying for themselves, but preferences seem to vary according to their jurisdiction's legislation on euthanasia, reveal the results of an international survey, published online in the Journal of Medical Ethics.

And most say they would prefer symptom relief rather than life sustaining treatment for their own end of life care, indicate the responses. 

Previously published research suggests that doctors' views on their own end of life care inform their clinical practice, and that their perceptions of their patients' treatment wishes are influenced by their own preferences, note the researchers.

But most of the studies on physicians' preferences for end of life practices are outdated and/or narrow in focus, added to which little is known about whether doctors would consider assisted dying for themselves, and whether this might be influenced by national or state legislation on the practice, point out the researchers.

To shed more light on these issues, the researchers surveyed doctors in 8 jurisdictions with differing laws and attitudes to assisted dying: Belgium; Italy; Canada; the US states of Oregon, Wisconsin, and Georgia; and the states of Victoria and Queensland in Australia.

Physician-assisted suicide law entered the statute book in Oregon in 1997, while Death with Dignity legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin numerous times over the past 20 years but remains illegal. It is also illegal in Georgia which is one of the most religious states in the US. In Canada, both physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia have been permitted since 2016.

In Belgium, assisted dying has been legal since 2002, but remains illegal in Italy, one of the most religious countries in Europe. The Australian state of Victoria implemented assisted dying legislation in June 2019. In Queensland, assisted dying legislation was passed in 2021, but had not yet come into force when the data for this study were collected (May 2022–February 2023).

Two hypothetical situations were included to probe doctors' views on end of life care: advanced cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Respondents were asked the extent to which they would consider various end of life practices for themselves These included cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), mechanical ventilation, tube feeding, intensified alleviation of symptoms, palliative sedation, the use of available drugs to end life, physician-assisted suicide, and euthanasia.

Responses were sought from family doctors (GPs), palliative care doctors, and other medical specialists highly likely to treat patients at the end of their life, such as cardiologists, emergency medicine doctors, oncologists, neurologists, and intensive care specialists.

Of the 1408 survey responses received 1157 were included in the final analysis. These showed that doctors rarely considered life sustaining practices a (very) good option in cancer and Alzheimer's, respectively: CPR 0.5% and 0.2%; mechanical ventilation 0.8% and 0.3%; tube feeding 3.5% and 3.8%. 

Most (94% and 91%, respectively) considered intensifying symptom relief a good or very good option, while 59% and 50%, respectively, considered palliative sedation a good or very good option.

Respondents who considered palliative sedation for Alzheimer's disease as a good or very good option ranged from just over 39% in Georgia to just over 66% in Italy.

About half of respondents considered euthanasia a (very) good option: just over 54% and 51.5%, respectively, for cancer and Alzheimer's disease. The proportion of those considering euthanasia a (very) good option ranged from 38% in Italy to 81% in Belgium (cancer scenario), and almost 37.5% in Georgia, to almost 67.5% in Belgium (Alzheimer's disease scenario).

Around 1 in 3 (33.5%) respondents said they would consider drugs at their disposal to end their own life (cancer scenario).

While sex, age, and ethnicity didn't seem to influence doctors' preferences for end of life practices, prevailing legislation in their jurisdiction did.

Doctors working in a jurisdiction with a legal option for both euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide were 3 times as likely to consider euthanasia a (very) good option for cancer and almost twice as likely to consider it a (very) good option for Alzheimer's disease.

""This may be because these physicians are more familiar and comfortable with the practices and have observed positive clinical outcomes. It also suggests that macro-level factors heavily impact personal attitudes and preferences, and physicians are likely influenced by what is considered 'normal' practice in their own jurisdiction,"" say the researchers.

GPs and other specialists were less likely to consider palliative sedation a good or very good option than palliative care doctors, and they were more likely to consider euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide, and the use of available medication to end their own life a (very) good option.

And doctors who weren't religious were more likely to consider physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia a preferable option than those with a strongly held faith: physician-assisted suicide 65% vs 38%; euthanasia 72% vs 40%.

Due to the study design and nature of surveys the results can't be considered fully representative, and those doctors with a particular interest in the subject may have been more likely to take part, acknowledge the researchers. While the overall recruitment of respondents was satisfactory in all jurisdictions, GPs were under-represented among the Canadian respondents. 

But note the researchers: ""Our findings show that across all jurisdictions physicians largely prefer intensified alleviation of symptoms and to avoid life-sustaining techniques like CPR, mechanical ventilation, and tube feeding. 

""This finding may also relate to the moral distress some physicians feel about the routine continuation of treatment for their patients at the end of life.These findings warrant reflection on current clinical practice since life-prolonging treatment is still widely used for patients,yet is not preferred by physicians for themselves.""

As the only tenure-track psychologist in psychiatry at her institute, she has pioneered multidisciplinary approaches that combine neuroimaging, genetic analysis, and immunological markers to decode the biological signatures of childhood trauma.

The immune system doesn't just fight infections-it plays a crucial role in shaping our mental health throughout life. Childhood trauma can fundamentally reprogram these immune responses, creating vulnerability to depression, bipolar disorder, and other psychiatric conditions decades later.""

Sara Poletti, PhD, senior researcher at IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele Milan

Her work raises critical questions about prevention and intervention: Can we identify biological markers of trauma early enough to prevent psychiatric disorders? How do protective factors buffer against neuroinflammatory responses? What role does timing play in trauma's biological impact? These questions drive Dr. Poletti's innovative research program.

Dr. Poletti's path to neuroscience began with a childhood microscope and evolved through encounters with Freud's writings and neuroimaging studies of violent criminals. This eclectic background equipped her with unique perspectives on brain-behavior relationships. Despite warnings that psychedelic and inflammation research was ""career suicide"" in 2006, she persisted in exploring these then-marginalized areas that have since become central to psychiatric research.

As Project Leader at San Raffaele's Psychiatry and Clinical Psychobiology Unit, Dr. Poletti coordinates diverse teams of psychologists, physicians, and biologists. Her leadership of a European Research Area Network (ERA-NET) Neuron project on the consequences of infections on mental health exemplifies her ability to foster international collaboration in advancing inflammation's role in psychiatric disorders.

One defining moment in Dr. Poletti's career came when she reluctantly accepted a teaching position in human physiology-a field she knew little about. ""It required extensive studying and put me to the test,"" she recalls. ""However, I learned a great deal from this experience, both scientifically and personally."" This challenge deepened her understanding of body-brain interactions, proving invaluable for her later research on neuroinflammation.

Her resilience in facing academic challenges mirrors the resilience she studies in trauma survivors. Some individuals exposed to severe childhood adversity develop psychiatric disorders while others don't-understanding these differences could revolutionize preventive psychiatry. What biological factors confer resilience? How can we enhance natural protective mechanisms? Dr. Poletti's research addresses these fundamental questions.

Dr. Poletti's findings have immediate clinical relevance. By identifying specific inflammatory markers associated with childhood trauma, her work provides potential targets for novel interventions. This precision medicine approach could transform psychiatric treatment from symptom management to addressing underlying biological mechanisms. Following this line of reasoning she published the first paper on the use of an immunomodulatory agent (interleukin 2) to treat mood disorders.

""I aim to further elucidate the role of the immune system and its interaction with the environment in psychiatric disorders,"" Dr. Poletti states. Her vision includes developing prevention strategies to reduce mental illness odds, particularly for individuals with trauma histories. This preventive focus represents a paradigm shift from reactive to proactive psychiatric care.

The interview reveals how Dr. Poletti's passion for Italian mountain hiking informs her scientific approach. Standing atop Sasso Nero at 2,847 meters, she finds the clarity and renewal that fuel her research endeavors. This connection to nature reflects her holistic view of mental health, recognizing that human wellbeing extends beyond biological mechanisms to encompass environmental and experiential factors.

Questions about trauma's transgenerational effects add another dimension to Dr. Poletti's work. Can childhood trauma alter genetic expression in ways that affect offspring? How do social and cultural factors modulate biological responses to adversity? These considerations expand the scope of trauma research from individual to societal levels.

Dr. Poletti's research contributes to a growing recognition that mental health is inseparable from physical health, particularly immune function. This integrated perspective challenges traditional boundaries between psychiatry and other medical specialties, promoting more comprehensive approaches to patient care.

The implications extend beyond individual treatment. If childhood trauma creates lasting biological vulnerabilities, what responsibilities do societies have for preventing adverse childhood experiences? How can healthcare systems better integrate trauma screening and early intervention? Dr. Poletti's work provides scientific grounding for these critical policy discussions.

Dr. Sara Poletti's Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today's most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers.

Human metabolism is a complex web of chemical processes and interactions between our cells and the microbes living within us. The more scientists can identify and classify the molecules involved in our metabolism, called metabolites, the more we can learn about human health and disease. Now, researchers at University of California San Diego have made a major advance in our understanding of human metabolism by describing hundreds of new N-acyl lipids, a type of molecule involved in immune and stress responses.

The main findings of the study, published in Cell, were:

Metabolites are the language that the body uses to communicate with itself and with our microbiome, and studying them can offer significant insight into the role of microbial metabolism in health and disease. It's like we've added hundreds of new words to the metabolic dictionary.""

Pieter Dorrestein, Ph.D., senior author, professor at UC San Diego Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Departments of Pharmacology and Pediatrics at UC San Diego School of Medicine

Human metabolism is a delicate system, and imbalances in metabolism have been linked to a wide range of diseases, including diabetes, cancer and neurological disorders. For decades, much of the underlying biochemistry of human metabolism, including the role of the human microbiome, has gone unknown, making it harder to understand and treat diseases related to metabolism.

The hundreds of new compounds help fill this knowledge gap.

""The big surprise here was how diverse this group of compounds actually is,"" said first author Helena Mannochio Russo, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in Dorrestein's lab.

Within the previously unknown molecules, the researchers found that many were found in the digestive tract and contained short-chain fatty acids, a known hallmark of microbial metabolism. The distribution pattern of these molecules also varied based on diet, microbial colonization, and in people with diseases that impact the microbiome, such as diabetes. Together, these findings suggest that the newly-identified metabolites are produced by the human microbiome.

The researchers also found that these microbial metabolites were associated with HIV status and cognitive impairment, suggesting a potential link between the gut microbiome and neurological function in individuals with HIV. However, it will take more research to fully understand the implications of this connection of the gut microbes language and how they affect cognition.

""There's so much we can learn from existing data, and the more we utilize reverse metabolomics, the more we'll be able to learn about how the microbiome interacts with us and impacts our health, and the faster we'll be able to learn from it,"" added Mannochio Russo. ""This is just the beginning.""

Breathalyzers are a frequently used tool to measure the amount of ethanol in someone's breath, which relates to their blood alcohol content. However, alcoholic beverages contaminated by methanol (sometimes called wood alcohol) are hard to identify and toxic if ingested. Researchers reporting in ACS Sensors have developed a prototype sensor that quickly and easily detects small amounts of methanol in breath - a step toward developing a ""methanol breathalyzer"" to efficiently diagnose poisonings.

Methanol and ethanol, despite being structurally similar, have vastly different effects on the body when ingested. Ethanol gives wine, beer and spirits their classification as alcoholic beverages and causes physiological effects like nausea, dizziness and temporary neurological impairment. However, consuming even small amounts of methanol can cause blindness, convulsions and even death. Methanol is an inexpensive industrial solvent that is sometimes added to alcoholic beverages to lower their cost, a practice that was particularly common when bootleg alcohol production was rife. But in 2025, this practice still causes cases of methanol poisoning and death. Diagnosing methanol poisoning typically involves analyzing blood samples from an affected person, which can be costly and complicated - especially considering that tainted alcohol is found primarily in low-income countries. So, Dusan Losic and colleagues instead wanted to create a reliable and easy-to-use methanol breathalyzer sensor.

The researchers formulated a specialized electrically conductive ink that combined a zirconium-based metal-organic framework (MOF) and graphene. They then 3D-printed the ink onto a ceramic, creating the sensor. A machine created artificial breath by blending dry air with humid air containing methanol and then mimicked blowing the breath into a chamber containing the sensor. The prototype detected methanol at concentrations as low as 50 parts per billion (below the levels found in breath during methanol poisoning) and maintained its stability and performance after several repeated sensing cycles. Initially, the sensor struggled to differentiate methanol and ethanol in a breath-like environment. Therefore, the team used statistical analysis and a trained machine learning algorithm to distinguish the gases. These artificial intelligence tools allowed the sensor to detect methanol at parts-per-billion and ethanol at parts-per-million concentrations.

This work demonstrates the first step toward using graphene and this MOF to detect methanol in air. The researchers say further development is needed to distinguish between methanol and ethanol in the higher humidity of exhaled breath before an easy, simple life-saving methanol breathalyzer device becomes a reality.

A new study from Emory University addresses the growing global crisis of antibiotic-resistant infections. Many of these drug-resistant bacteria are spread through hospitals, and there are few antibiotics available for treatment.

The study, published in PNAS, looks at a particular bacterium called Acinetobacter baumannii, which is highly infectious, spread mostly in hospitals and typically infects immunocompromised patients. The researchers employed an entirely new strategy to identify weaknesses specific to resistant bacteria and then target these weaknesses with an alternate drug. They found that fendiline, a drug that acts as a calcium channel blocker and formerly used to treat heart arrhythmia kills the bacterium by targeting the essential lipoprotein trafficking pathway, which is weakened in antibiotic resistant bacteria.

It's critical that we find more and better therapeutics that can target these antibiotic-resistant infections which affect patients on ventilators, those with deep soft tissue infections, and the immunocompromised.""

Philip Rather, PhD, corresponding author on the paper and professor, Emory University School of Medicine

""This novel finding repurposes an existing drug, exploits a newly identified vulnerability in an antibiotic-resistant bacterium, and opens doors for developing new antibiotics targeting similar pathways,"" says Jennifer Colquhoun, PhD, first author and research scientist at Emory University.

SCBEMs are three dimensional structures that replicate key aspects of early embryonic development, offering unprecedented potential to enhance our understanding of human developmental biology and reproductive science.

Stem cell-based embryo models are poised to revolutionize our understanding of early human development and improve clinical practices in assisted reproduction. However, as these models advance, it is crucial that they are studied in a framework that balances scientific progress with ethical, legal, and social considerations. These proposed recommendations are designed to foster innovation while at the same time providing regulatory guidance for key stakeholders in this vital area of biomedical research.""

Amander Clark, University of California, Los Angeles, USA, co-chair of the ISSCR Embryo Models Working Group and an expert in human stem cell and reproductive science

Janet Rossant, CC, PhD, world-renowned expert in developmental biology and co-chair of the ISSCR Embryo Models Working Group stated, ""Given the acceleration of these technologies, it was important to convene a working group to evaluate whether the existing ISSCR Guidelines should be amended to keep pace with new advances.""

The recommendations outlined in the paper, Stem cell-based embryo models: the 2021 ISSCR stem cell guidelines revisited, address recent scientific breakthroughs that enable the creation of increasingly complex models efficiently and without reliance on major extraembryonic lineages. The group made three central recommendations:

The paper also recommends the removal of the distinction between integrated and non-integrated models. These modifications aim to bring clarity to the emerging field, guide the deliberations of researchers, oversight committees, and stakeholders, and ensure the continued confidence of the public in the responsible advancement of SCBEM research.

The co-chairs will present the proposed recommendations in June to the ISSCR Board of Directors as part of a targeted update to the 2021 ISSCR Guidelines for Stem Cell Research and Clinical Translation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Recombinant zoster vaccine well tolerated by patients with inflammatory RMD","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/Recombinant-zoster-vaccine-well-tolerated-by-patients-with-inflammatory-RMD.aspx","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 17:29:00 GMT","

Herpes zoster (HZ) is common in older people, with a lifetime risk of 25%. The main risk factors are advanced age and immunosuppression. People with a rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease have an overall higher risk for shingles. EULAR - The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology - recommends that HZ vaccination be considered in high-risk patients with an autoimmune and inflammatory RMD. Live vaccines are difficult in patients on immunosuppressive therapies; newer non-live vaccines may replace the live-attenuated version, but when the last recommendations were developed the safety and efficacy of the subunit zoster vaccine had not yet been investigated in patients with RMD.

New work presented at the 2025 annual EULAR congress in Barcelona focuses on the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV), which contains recombinant glycoprotein E - the major target of CD4+T-cells. The abstract describes the tolerability and safety of RZV in patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (iRMD), showcasing interim data from an ongoing study.

In total, 150 adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), or giant cell arteritis (GCA) who had an indication to receive RZV were prospectively included. Of these, 21.3% had a history of HZ, and everyone received RZV at Month 0; 90% also received a dose at Month 2. Safety assessments were performed at Months 2, 3, 6, and 12.

Most adverse events (AE) occurred within a few days after vaccination. In total, 139 (46.8%) localized and 158 (53.2%) generalized AE occurred up to Month 3. At that point, pain at the site of injection was the most frequent AE, reported by 32.7% of patients. This was followed by fever (14.1%), fatigue (9.4%), musculoskeletal pain (8.1%), swelling at the injection site (6.4%) and redness at the injection site (6.4%). Infections (4.7%), worsening of the disease (3.7%) and other AEs (7.7%) were reported until Month 3.

Disease flares were reported by patients at Months 2, 3, 6 and 12, but of these only 1.6-8.6% fulfilled the predefined flare criteria. Hospitalisation due to disease flare was needed for 3 patients - 2 with GCA and 1 with RA. Lead author Uta Kiltz said ""over the observed period of 12 months, this can be interpreted as a low rate of events.""

Overall, 10 serious AEs were reported in 9 patients during follow-up (3 flares, 4 malignancies, and 3 comorbidities), but no patient reported an AE of special interest or a breakthrough infection. Of note, the malignancies were considered not to be related to the vaccination.

The authors concluded that the majority of patients tolerated RZV well, with only a few reports of flare and serious AEs. These findings are reassuring for rheumatologists and future vaccine recipients, and support confidence in RZV safety for patients with an iRMD.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Smelling food triggers fullness through newly found brain pathway","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/Smelling-food-triggers-fullness-through-newly-found-brain-pathway.aspx","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 13:22:00 GMT","

No more hunger after cooking? A newly identified network of nerve cells is responsible, a research group at the Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research has discovered in mice. They discovered a direct connection from the nose to a group of nerve cells in the brain that are activated by the smell of food and, when activated, trigger a feeling of fullness. This was not the case in obese mice. This discovery suggests that treating obesity might require different advice about smelling food before a meal based on a person's weight. 

The researchers used brain scans to investigate which regions of the mice's brains respond to food odours, and were able to identify a new group of nerve cells in the medial septum of the brain. These nerve cells respond to food in two steps: When the mouse smells food, the nerve cells fire and create a sensation of fullness. This happens within a few seconds because the nerve cells are directly connected to the olfactory bulb. The nerve cells react to different food smells, but not to other smells. When the mice started to eat, the nerve cells were inhibited. Overall, the mice ate less when these nerve cells are active before eating.

We think this mechanism helps mice in the wild protect themselves from predators. By eating for shorter periods, they reduce their chances of being caught.""

Janice Bulk, the first author of the study

In obese mice, the same group of nerve cells was not activated when the mice could smell food. The mice did not feel fuller and did not eat less overall. The authors point out that it is already known that obesity disrupts the olfactory system, including neuronal activity in the olfactory bulb. The newly identified group of nerve cells could also be affected by obesity.

The human brain contains the same group of nerve cells as the mouse, but it is not yet known whether they also respond to food odours. Studies by other research groups have shown that smelling some specific odors before a meal can reduce people's appetite. In contrast, other studies have shown that overweight persons eat significantly more in the same situation.

""Our findings highlight how crucial it is to consider the sense of smell in appetite regulation and in the development of obesity. Our study shows how much our daily-lives' eating habits are influenced by the smell of food. Since we discovered that the pathway only reduces appetite in lean mice, but not in obese mice, our study opens up a new way to help prevent overeating in obesity"", says Sophie Steculorum, the head of the study and research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research.

NWSL

University of North Carolina midfielder Evelyn Shores isn't taking a break this summer.

Six months after helping the Tar Heels capture their 23rd NCAA title,  she scored the winning goal last month for the U.S. women's national team against Germany at under-23 level. And on Monday, she found the back of the net again, winning $1million for the US Women at The Soccer Tournament (TST) staged just miles from her university.

Recruited by former USWNT midfielder Heather O'Reilly, 20 years her senior, Shores joined a team of American legends, including O'Reilly, Carli Lloyd and Ali Krieger, for the seven-a-side, winner-takes-all competition. 

“I was sprinting back to recover on defense, saw Heather (O'Reilly) win the ball, and just went. I was exhausted, but I had to go,” Shores tells The Athletic. “She put it on a platter for me. I had to finish it.”

 

 

A post shared by TST (@tst7v7)



Though still jetlagged from her trip across the Atlantic Ocean with the under-23s, Shores went straight into training alongside players she'd watched win World Cups and Olympic gold medals. 

“Playing one-v-one in practice with Carli Lloyd the day after flying in from Germany? That was insane,” she says. “They made us feel like equals. That was the craziest part.”

She was one of the five North Carolina (UNC) players O'Reilly invited to join her and the other World Cup winners at TST, which takes place over a week in Cary, North Carolina. 

“I have always liked Evelyn as a player, from the first minute I saw her play at Carolina,” O'Reilly tells The Athletic. “I'm thrilled that she had that goal, because she had a very good tournament and does a lot of nuanced work for the team that maybe isn't flashy, but she had her moment, and we are all so happy about that.”

For Shores, TST was a refreshing change of pace.

“It's such a fun tournament,” she says. “The ball moves fast, everyone's pressing, you sub out the second you're tired, and fans are basically on top of the field. It's a different kind of soccer — and maybe more exciting for people who aren't into the traditional 11 v 11 (format).”

The 20-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia, began her soccer journey at age four at Tophat FC, an elite youth academy in her home state. For Shores, soccer is a family tradition. Her mother, a former North Carolina player, was her first coach. Her grandpa had coached her mom. 

“I wrote a letter to myself in fifth grade saying I hoped I'd get a scholarship to UNC. I committed in eighth grade (a child's aged 13 or 14 year),” Shores said. “I always knew I wanted to come here.”

That commitment has paid off. In her rookie year, she appeared in 13 matches, finishing that season ranked third on the team with four goals, three assists and 11 points, to lead all UNC freshmen. She scored her first college brace in a three-minute stretch against the University of South Carolina, which included her first goal. 

But in the October, her promising first season came to a halt. While attempting a tackle near the sideline against Wake Forest, she got tangled up with an opposition player and collapsed, clutching her right knee, unable to stand without help. Five days later, Shores announced she'd torn her ACL and that her season was over. 

Amid the heartbreak, she had support from her family and friends throughout the recovery process and she counted the days to her comeback. After two surgeries and a difficult rehabilitation period, Shores returned in 2024 to play in the final 10 games of the season, with her first appearance back coming against No. 1-ranked Duke in the regular-season finale. 

“My first goal back from my injury was very special,” she tells The Athletic. 

She scored against Duke, UNC's biggest rival, with her left foot in the 44th minute. 

“After such a long time off the field, coming back and scoring was like a huge deal to me,” she says. 

Just over a month later, Shores played 44 minutes as UNC beat Wake Forest 1-0 to win the NCAA title.

Announcing herself with a goal is a habit now.

When Shores was named to the USWNT Under-23 camp last month, she was the only player there not signed to a professional contract. But that didn't matter on the field. In the final minute of stoppage time on May 30 in the German town of Aspach, after a scramble in the box, Seattle Reign center back Jordyn Bugg lifted a ball over Germany's defense. Shores got on the end of the looping pass and one-timed the ball into the net.

“It was a surreal experience,” Shores tells The Athletic. “Honestly, I couldn't even really celebrate after the goal, because I was just so relieved.”

The U.S. split results during the window, losing 2-1 to the Germans a couple of days later, and Shores flew directly back to North Carolina to represent the U.S. in a different capacity. She, again, introduced herself with a game-winning goal.

 

 

A post shared by Evelyn Shores (@evelynshores)



For now, Shores is focused on a healthy return, another trip to the NCAA College Cup, and if the stars align, TST again next year. 

As for the $1million she helped win, for not just herself but the players she's looked up to? Unfortunately for Shores, NCAA rules prohibit student-athletes from accepting prize money. “I'm not actually sure where my portion goes,” she says with a shrug. “But I'm just happy to be a part of it.”

A spokesperson for TST confirmed that the money that could not be awarded to the college players was divided evenly among the rest of the group.

While her TST goal may be the most high-profile moment yet, it's likely just the beginning for the rising college junior. She's still undecided about whether she'll pursue a professional career in the U.S. or abroad, but one thing's clear: she's got options.

 “I've always wanted to be a pro. That's been the dream since I was little,” she said.

“This will be my first healthy preseason in a while,” Shores said, speaking about her immediate future. “Just being back on the field, competing, playing with teammates I love, it's all been surreal.”

United States women's head soccer coach Emma Hayes plans to give Europe-based players a “much-needed break” this summer and instead will rely on a pool of almost exclusively domestic talent for the upcoming international window.

In an interview with ESPN on Tuesday night, Hayes said the only Europe-based player she expects to call up is Chelsea defender Naomi Girma. The vice-captain and defender returned from injury to the national team for the first time in 2025 earlier this month.

“This is the first opportunity, and the only one for them, to take a break between now and the World Cup in two years,” Hayes said, “and player welfare and rest and recovery are also important for these players.”

The USWNT has a pair of friendlies against Ireland in late June in Colorado and Ohio, followed by a match against Canada in Washington, D.C., on July 2.

The decision to rest players, Hayes said, was collaborative with input from the USWNT's medical and performance teams. They accounted for the number of games played, lengths of players' seasons and their frequency of games, beginning with the 2023 World Cup.

This year offers a rare respite from international competitions for U.S. national team players. World Cup qualifying begins next year, followed by the 2027 World Cup in Brazil and then the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.

Hayes pointed to players like Arsenal's Emily Fox and Lyon's Lindsey Heaps, who in the past two years had little to no time off due to a packed international calendar that transitions quickly into their club seasons in Europe.

“In Europe, players play for 10.5, 11 months, Hayes said. “And with those tournaments and the way that they take place, sort of in late summer in (the) football calendar, meant that they were literally getting a week's break and going back into a full 11-month season.”

Fox, for example, helped Arsenal lift the UEFA Women's Champions League trophy on May 24 in Lisbon, Portugal, before flying to the national team camp in Minnesota in June. Arsenal's preseason is set to begin in July.

“It means the player doesn't get an offseason, which in the short term, doesn't have a negative impact on the U.S. women's national team, but when we factor in the World Cup, followed by an Olympics 12 months later, this is the only real opportunity that they can have an off season,” Hayes said. “We don't necessarily decide the international calendar, but this is one where we think it's in the best interest for the players.”

Most of the players called up for this next training camp will likely be from the NWSL, which will break from its regular season in July. This upcoming roster also has the potential for some USWNT veterans to return to the fold.

Hayes hinted at midfielder Rose Lavelle making her return to the national stage after a six-month absence following ankle surgery. She had a successful return to the club stage with Gotham over the weekend, despite the team falling to Kansas City Current, 2-1.

“Very much hope that she will be with us in camp,” Hayes said. “She's had, as she calls it, you know, a very lengthy layoff. … I think it was great for her to make an appearance at the weekend, but we miss her at the national team.”

Hayes also told ESPN that forward Trinity Rodman will remain absent from this upcoming window, as the 23-year-old continues to wrestle with an ongoing back injury. She anticipates her return to the Washington Spirit “in July at some point.”

“She's in great spirits, and I know we're moving in the right direction with Trin,” Hayes said. “Both club and country have been working hard to get her to this stage.”

The United States men's team is hammered 4-0 by Switzerland in Nashville, piling more pressure on coach Mauricio Pochettino. (1:13)

As the United States men's national team trudged off the field at half-time, boos rang out at Geodis Park in Nashville, Tennessee. And every single last one of them was deserved.

The U.S. was already down 4-0 to Switzerland, and went on to lose by that same score. The first half looked a scrimmage between the varsity and the junior varsity; young players being thrown into the lion's den and getting mauled. Already utilizing a roster bereft of over a dozen experienced players, USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino is operating with a green roster. But he wanted to see what they had, so he made nine changes to the team that lost to Turkey 2-1 last Saturday. Five of those changes saw players with fewer than five caps at the start of this camp enter the line-up.

The move proved fatal. the visitors broke on top in the 13th minute on a goal by Dan Ndoye and didn't take their foot off the gas for the rest of the half with strikes from Michel Aebischer (23rd minute), Breel Embolo (32nd minute) and Johan Manzambi (35th minute). The U.S. defense was cut to pieces with ease.

A flurry of substitutions at half-time, five in all, as well as a move to three center backs, helped staunch the bleeding. Pochettino said on TNT's broadcast that the changes were planned, but what choice did he have? Regardless, it provided no consolation at all given what transpired in the first half.

Afterwards, Pochettino admitted that his desire to get everyone playing time over the last two matches before the Gold Cup was a step too far.

""That was my decision, and it was my fault,"" Pochettino said in his post-game press conference. ""The first half, all the critics should be, or could be for me because I think that was my decision. But at the same time, it was the good intention to provide all the players the possibility to play and try to compete for a place the World Cup.""

How bad was this performance? In terms of losing streaks and goals conceded, it makes for grim reading. Per ESPN Stats and Information, the U.S. conceded four goals in the first 40 minutes of a match for the first time since Nov. 9, 1980 in Mexico. It was the first time this had ever happened at home. The last time the U.S. lost this many matches in a row came in 2007 during a five-game stretch under Bob Bradley. Those included three consecutive losses at the 2007 Copa America in Venezuela with a less than full strength roster, as well as friendly defeats to Sweden and Brazil. The USMNT hadn't lost four consecutive games at home since 1988 when it lost two games each to Chile and Ecuador. We're talking about a time near the end of U.S. soccer's dark ages.

Among the head-shaking developments -- and there were a lot of them -- was that what Switzerland was doing offensively wasn't all that complicated. Simple diagonal passes out of the back completely flummoxed the U.S. defense. Playing out of the back seemed beyond what the U.S. was capable of. And then there were the basic errors. Failing to track runners. A lack of pressure on the ball in midfield. The U.S. press looked completely uncoordinated. The list goes on.

Was the youth of the starting a lineup a factor? You bet. But it wasn't just the youth that was a problem. It was the lack of competitiveness. Pochettino praised his team for that aspect following the Turkey game last Saturday. Against Switzerland it was largely absent. Combine that with the gulf in quality between the two sides and you get a result like Tuesday's.

The most sobering realization of all is that the USMNT's depth, at least the kind that can help them in next year's World Cup, is threadbare. Outside backs Nathan Harriel and Max Arfsten looked completely overmatched. The same went for midfielders Sebastian Berhalter and Quinn Sullivan. It was the latter's giveaway that led to Switzerland's fourth by Manzambi.

The only sliver of hope was the play of the substitutes, led by Diego Luna and Tim Ream, but it would be foolish to read too much into what was essentially 45 minutes of garbage time. The thought that this starting line-up will never see the field together again provides some encouragement. There also seems to be a clear demarcation line between the players that can contribute in the Gold Cup, and those who can't. That data is valuable, no matter how painfully it was acquired.

Afterwards, Ream did what he could to maintain a semblance of composure over the result.

""I think there's some individual errors that we make, and we get punished for them at this level, and you see it all around the world,"" he said during TNT's postgame coverage.

""And that's a learning process for a lot of guys who are earning very, very few caps, very first caps. And again, it's a learning experience. We have to be calm; we have to keep our head on right, analyze what the first half especially, and even things in the second half that we can do better. And if we do that, we will be all right.""

And what of the upcoming Gold Cup? Expectations were already heading in a downward trajectory in terms of how far the U.S. can make it in the tournament. At this stage, it wouldn't be a surprise to see the U.S. eliminated before the final.

Avoiding that outcome will require Pochettino tilting his line-up towards more experience rather than going hell-bent on youth. He'll also be hoping that midfielder Tyler Adams, who sat out the game with a foot injury, manages to heal up and stay that way. His veteran presence in the center of midfield will do plenty to help some of the younger players work through tough spots.

But the U.S. enters the Gold Cup with tons of questions about its quality, its mettle, and its willingness to adapt to situations. There are questions about the manager too. Right now, none of them can be answered positively. The next four weeks will see if this version of the USMNT can change that.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

A year and two days before its 2026 FIFA World Cup opener, the United States men's national team was booed off the field by its own fans in a half-empty stadium in Nashville. 

In a tune-up game for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup, which kicks off for the U.S. against Trinidad and Tobago on Sunday, the American dismantling at the hands of Switzerland was so comprehensive that the home team gave up more first-half goals (four) than it had in 40 years. Only Swiss disinterest in running the score up further in the second half seemed to spare the Americans—who registered zero shots on goal—from further humiliation than the 4-0 defeat. 

It was the fourth straight loss by the USMNT, its longest such streak since 2007, and a new nadir on the potholed road to the second World Cup to be played (mostly) on U.S. soil.

What Will the World Cup Stand For in an Isolationist America?

FIFA's Club World Cup Is an Audacious Bet on Limitless Growth—and Greed

Two weeks earlier, Mauricio Pochettino, U.S. Soccer's high-profile head coach hire last fall, had sounded the alarm when he announced his initial roster for the monthlong Gold Cup preparation camp. Near the end of a session with the American soccer press assembled on Zoom, Pochettino, unprompted, threw a verbal haymaker at his team's culture. 

“What we want to create in our national team is people desperate to come but desperate to come to perform,” he said. “We only have time to train one, two, three times, play [a game]. One, two recoveries [sessions], and play. And then go home and maybe wait two months to be all together [again]. If you want to arrive to the camp, and you want to spend a nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friends—and that is the culture we want to create? No, no, no, no, no. What we want to do is be focused and spend all my focus and energy on the national team. We need to create this culture about winning and to chase our aim. If we want to be good in one year's time [at the 2026 World Cup], we need to think that today is the most important day.”

On Sunday, Pochettino repeated this edict in Spanish and added a flourish. “I want 11 lions or wolves—or whatever animal you like best and is the most aggressive​​—on the field,” he said. “That they fight as if lives are on the line.”

The USMNT's last camp back in March, ahead of the finals of the CONCACAF Nations League, another regional trophy, had been a debacle. The Americans had won all three of the maiden editions of that tournament beginning in 2019 but lost to Panama in the semifinal and Canada in the third-place match this time around. They were both narrow losses, but the USMNT looked disheveled, no longer an effervescently gifted young team on the rise but rather a loose collection of unfamiliar players, adrift and disinterested. 

“For us, we learned a lot in the last few camps, for sure in March,” said Pochettino. “And I think it's about to be [a] different approach.”

He wasn't alone in voicing his concern. “When we come back, some things need to change and we need to improve,” captain Christian Pulisic had said in March. “Obviously, the feeling is not good right now. We need to turn it around and we can hopefully build some momentum this summer, because we really do need it.”

Whatever momentum and credibility a young and inexperienced team had assembled in a sound performance at the 2022 World Cup, reaching the round of 16, had been squandered. Plainly, ditching Gregg Berhalter after last summer's disappointing Copa América, ending his underwhelming second spell in charge, did little to lift the cloud over this team, or help it bust out of its slump. Nor had the switch to the most high-profile coach the USMNT has ever employed fixed any of the team's issues—at least not yet. The attacking shortcomings, the glaring lack of feistiness, the habit of playing down to weaker teams, they had all survived the coaching change—making the uncomfortable suggestion that perhaps the ousted head coach, who was popular with the players but not exactly with the fans, wasn't actually the problem. Worse still, the vibes on a team that once prided itself on its closeness were now very obviously rancid. 

“It's like a crossroads that we have now,” said defender Chris Richards. “After March, we really kind of had to look inside of ourselves and figure out what was the problem.”

“I don't think there's any denying that some of our performances have fallen short over the past year to 18 months,” echoed fellow defender Walker Zimmerman. “It's something that, us as players, we obviously aren't satisfied with, and it's a big focal point for this camp.”

Meanwhile, time marches inexorably on towards the 2026 World Cup, kicking off exactly a year from today, which will mostly be played on home soil. As several recent classes of American talent—unprecedented in their upside and pedigree—pushed into the first teams of some of Europe's most laureled clubs, they were inevitably affixed with the “golden generation” label. By 2026, it was projected, they would hit their primes and coalesce, all of it culminating in some kind of signature achievement. Because the thing about a golden moniker is that it implies winning something. Or at least doing something.

This expectation is hardly lost on this team. “Whenever you have an opportunity to play in a home World Cup, you want to put on a show, you want to put on your best performance,” said midfielder and occasional captain Tyler Adams. “It's growing in stature and growing in confidence of the young team that we have, understanding the responsibility that we have and what it's going to take. I think everyone is going to be prepared for that moment. There's not a ton of games left, obviously, before the World Cup.”

There aren't. After this Gold Cup, just four separate nine-day international windows remain before the USMNT has to be ready for the real thing. That's 36 days in total, most of which will, as Pochettino pointed out, be lost to jet lag and match prep and recovery.

Yet instead of ironing out the last kinks and buffing the final blemishes on his team, Pochettino has had to hit a kind of hard reset. Now in his fifth camp in charge, he has called in no fewer than 59 different players. This turnover has partly been foisted on him by the absence of 10 regulars this summer—for reasons ranging from obligations in the Club World Cup, to injuries and, in the case of Pulisic, a need for rest—but it also gives the head coach a chance not only to try out fringe players and find depth pieces, but also to rewire the team's mindset. 

“Things happen in soccer,” said goalkeeper Matt Turner. “And I think what we need to control is what we bring to the table every single day: the intensity, the way we push each other, the passion, the energy, the connection with the fans, with each other, with the staff. We're going to be together for a long period of time and it's a really good opportunity for us to put a lot of things together, tactically, technically, emotionally.”

Pochettino, for his part, reported being pleased with the early mindset he had observed in the first week of camp. “This attitude I want to continue for the future until we are right to the World Cup,” he said. “That is the only way that we can improve. If I decide in September a different roster, what I want is the same level of commitment, attitude—not to complain about this and that, not excuses.”

The current, uncomplaining roster, missing all those regulars, faced a pair of strong but hardly unbeatable European(ish) teams in Türkiye and Switzerland in preparation for the Gold Cup. Certainly, the opposition in the run-up to the tournament would be stronger than it was likely to be in any game during the tournament itself, complicating the judgment of the performances. Still, the judgment, over the span of the two games, would be damning.

Against the Turks, the U.S. looked much more spirited than it had in March and scored a goal in the very first minute through a Jack McGlynn curler from outside the box. But a pair of defensive miscues in their own box midway through the first half consigned the Americans to a 2-1 loss, despite a series of second-half scoring chances on a soggy afternoon in East Hartford, Connecticut.

Even in defeat, it was enough to spark some optimism. “The team showed great energy, great mentality, great attitude,” Pochettino said after the match with Türkiye. “That is why I think I am so, so happy about the way that we delivered a show, in a way that we tried to play so positive. For sure, playing in this way, we are going to win most of the games. Today, OK, bad luck.”

But just three days later, whatever psychological building blocks had been put in place quickly disintegrated. Pochettino made a raft of changes, further diluting a team already missing so much of its first-choice talent, and Switzerland's dominance over a disjointed and utterly unthreatening American team was total. Radical optimism would be no salve this time around. 

“At halftime, we tried to change the system and to provide more calmness to the team,” Pochettino said after the game. “I think in the second half, the team matched Switzerland in all the areas, and that is the positive thing that we need to take from today.”

Pochettino's continued positivity following a pair of sound defeats says something about a bar that has been lowered far beyond what anyone might have imagined after Qatar. Presently, the team looks and sounds like one that's in rebuilding mode, taking satisfaction from flashes of promise, from spring's first green shoots. But actually, it's a team barreling toward a seminal event that might very well bend the arc of the sport in the country. If that sounds hyperbolic, the team's slogan for the second World Cup cycle under Berhalter was no less than to “change soccer in America forever.”

But after three years of never-before-seen highs from a team that really does have more technical talent than any previous incarnation, interspersed by are-we-really-still-doing-this lows, there is little choice but to peer at the near future through rose-tinted glasses. Because the pessimist's vantage point is bleak.

“Obviously, you wish that you would win every game in the lead-up to the World Cup and you're flying with confidence,” said Adams. “But it's a double-edged sword, so to speak, isn't it? You could be winning a bunch of games that don't really matter and get to the World Cup and not really have the performance that you want. Or you can go through a period of adaptation, like we're going through right now, and struggle a little bit and realize what's in front of you and realize how valuable playing in a home World Cup is going to be. To be honest, I think we're right where we're supposed to be right now. We've struggled, we've gotten beat down, we've been pegged back a stone. Now we need to continue to prove that we are at this level and able to improve. There's room for improvement to be sure but I'd rather that than be perfect.”

Certainly, there is no imminent prospect of perfection in this iteration of the U.S. men's national team. But a program that has been counting down to next summer ever since June 13 of 2018, when North America was awarded the 2026 World Cup, needs to fashion something out of itself that is at least passable. And very soon.

Following the U.S. Men's National Team's fourth consecutive loss on Tuesday, falling 4-0 to Switzerland, former international Alexi Lalas suggested that U.S. Soccer may be starting to panic.

Just a year away from the FIFA World Cup, which will be held in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT has continued to struggle to show any form of identity or cohesive vision on the field.

Losses to Panama and Canada at the CONCACAF Nations League Finals in March prompted heavy criticism from fans and former players alike, with many left questioning the desire of this generation of stars.

Now with a 2-1 loss to Turkey and a 4-0 loss to Switzerland under their belts as they head for the Gold Cup - the first time the USMNT has lost four straight games since 2007 - Lalas believes there must be some serious concerns regarding Pochettino, who was appointed in September, within the Federation.

“Ultimately, for someone like Pochettino, if he were to coach all the way through next summer, I still, even with this I don't see the Federation making a change, for someone like him, all that matters is the World Cup,” Lalas claimed on his State of the Union podcast.

“But, pushing all of those chips into next summer, but not only doing that, but on the other side, when we are seeing these games, I mean, there have to be panic buttons being pushed behind the scenes and certainly out there in American soccer land.”

Delving deeper into the performance of Pochettino's side against Switzerland, which saw him make nine changes from their loss to Turkey in an attempt to give fresh faces a chance to shine, his side ultimately fell flat early on, going 4-0 down within 36 minutes.

“The lack of energy, the lack of commitment, and in particular, because it's easy just to say, ‘spirit, energy, commitment,' I think the lack of the ability to press as a team and to be capable of doing it,” Lalas said of a team which is missing multiple presumptive starters such as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, and Antonee Robinson this summer. “And this is where I get into Mauricio Pochettino, I don't think that he should be absolved by any stretch of the imagination with what is going on here.”

What's more, Lalas believed that the USMNT looked as if they did not “know what they want to do, either because, like I said, they don't know what they want to do, or a team that can't do it.

“And I do think that, to be fair, even though this is a criticism, these players from a pure soccer perspective, individually and collectively, this group was not up to it.”

Perhaps fortunately for the USMNT, there is no time to sit and dwell on this latest gut punch, with their Gold Cup opener against Trinidad and Tobago scheduled for Sunday in San Jose. This will be followed by a trip to Austin on June 19, where they will face Saudi Arabia, before staying in Texas to take on Haiti in Arlington three days later.

Club World Cup

FIFA's latest attempts to fill Hard Rock Stadium for the Club World Cup opening match between Inter Miami and Egyptian team Al-Ahly involve offering students at an affiliated local college a single ticket for $20 — but with the promise of up to four complimentary tickets.

The Athletic last week revealed the launch game, which takes place on Saturday night, still had tens of thousands of tickets unsold for a match likely to star Lionel Messi for MLS side Inter Miami. Hard Rock Stadium has a capacity of 65,326. FIFA denied that fewer than 20,000 tickets had been sold for the match — insisting the number was “much higher” — but they did not specify the number.

Now, however, email promotions have been sent out to those connected to Miami Dade College, which announced a collaboration with FIFA in April 2024. This involves students being given the chance to intern at FIFA's Miami office, while FIFA's museum loans exhibits to the college. Miami Dade College has more than 100,000 students currently enrolled, according to the announcement made by FIFA of the partnership one year ago.

An email promotion sent out says that FIFA, in collaboration with Miami Dade College, is “providing up to four complimentary tickets to the opening match of the FIFA Club World Cup with the purchase of one ticket at the reduced student price of $20.” Those who respond are asked to submit their Miami Dade College email when using their purchase. If they secure the five tickets, then they are essentially able to watch Messi for just $4 a seat, which is a bargain for the local community but a long way away from FIFA's original expectations when pitching this tournament as the most coveted trophy in world club football.

As reported previously by The Athletic, FIFA has sold general sale tickets for the revamped 32-team Club World Cup under a dynamic pricing model, a system whereby prices fluctuate based on demand, and the slumping prices for certain games are indicative of FIFA's struggles to sell out stadiums.

As of last Tuesday, Inter Miami's game against Al-Ahly had dropped to $55, according to prices on Ticketmaster, the portal FIFA is using to sell tickets for the tournament. This was half of what they were available for in May, while tickets were $230 for the cheapest seat in January and $349 after the draw in December. FIFA is now hoping that the reduced prices will draw people in during a publicity blitz in the final week before the tournament.

Despite the $20 offer for the affiliated college, the cheapest seat available on Ticketmaster tonight was $69.15 for an “obstructed view.” It is not known how many tickets have now been sold for the game, but it is clear that FIFA is now taking every possible step to avoid any perception on Saturday night that the tournament is not in demand.

FIFA sources, speaking anonymously as they were not authorized to talk publicly on the matter, said that the organization has a strong relationship with the college and see it as a positive to extend the offer to their students to see world-class soccer on their doorstep.

Raheem Sterling and Jack Grealish spent one season together at Manchester City

Raheem Sterling, Joao Felix, Axel Disasi and Ben Chilwell have been left out of Chelsea's squad for the Fifa Club World Cup, while Jack Grealish has not been selected by Manchester City.

England forward Grealish was expected to miss out, with the 29-year-old having started just seven league games in 2024-25.

City's 27-man squad also does not include former captain Kyle Walker, who spent the second half of last season on loan at AC Milan, but features England defender John Stones, who has not played since February with a thigh injury.

Chelsea's 28-man group does not feature a quartet which cost them about £179m in transfer fees and all ended last season out on loan.

The first edition of the expanded Club World Cup format begins in the United States on Sunday, 15 June (01:00 BST).

Sterling cost £50m when he arrived from Manchester City in 2022, but the 30-year-old England forward spent last season on loan with Arsenal, starting just 13 games and scoring once. 

Felix made a permanent move to Chelsea last summer for £45m and scored seven goals from 20 appearances before the Portugal forward, 25, ended the campaign on loan at AC Milan.

The Blues paid £38.5m to sign Axel Disasi from Monaco in 2023 and the 27-year-old France defender played 17 games last term before ending the season on loan with Aston Villa.

Chilwell was a £45m signing in 2020 and, after just one Chelsea game last term, the England left-back, 28, spent the rest of the season with Crystal Palace, being an unused substitute in the Eagles' FA Cup final win over Manchester City.

Serbia goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic, 25, will not be travelling to the US either, after spending last season on loan with Strasbourg.

Goalkeepers: Robert Sanchez, Filip Jorgensen, Mike Penders, Gaga Slonina.

Defenders: Marc Cucurella, Tosin Adarabioyo, Benoit Badiashile, Levi Colwill, Mamadou Sarr, Moises Caicedo, Trevoh Chalobah, Reece James, Malo Gusto, Aaron Anselmino, Josh Acheampong.

Midfielders: Pedro Neto, Enzo Fernandez, Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Dario Essugo, Andrey Santos, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Romeo Lavia.

Forwards: Liam Delap, Nicolas Jackson, Christopher Nkunku, Tyrique George, Marc Guiu.

Why are Chelsea in the Club World Cup, but not Liverpool?

Man City sign £46.5m Reijnders - but where will he fit in?

Grealish's future is unclear as he has struggled for regular playing time with Manchester City over the past two seasons.

Pep Guardiola's side have also signed midfielders Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki this week, along with left-back Rayan Ait-Nouri and keeper Marcus Bettinelli, and all will travel to America.

Stones, 31, will return to action despite missing international duty with England over the weekend, and Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, 28, will continue his comeback from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in September.

Academy product James McAtee, 22, will remain at the European Under-21 Championship, where the attacking midfielder is England captain.

Goalkeepers: Ederson, Stefan Ortega, Marcus Bettinelli.

Defenders: Ruben Dias, John Stones, Nathan Ake, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Vitor Reis, Josko Gvardiol, Manuel Akanji, Abdukodir Khusanov, Rico Lewis.

Midfielders: Tijjani Reijnders, Jeremy Doku, Nico Gonzalez, Rodri, Ilkay Gundogan, Bernardo Silva, Savinho, Matheus Nunes, Rayan Cherki, Phil Foden, Nico O'Reilly.

Forwards: Omar Marmoush, Erling Haaland, Claudio Echeverri, Oscar Bobb.

Filed under:

All set for the first tournament of the Xabi Alonso era.

Unsurprisingly given their domination of the UEFA Champions League in the 21st century, Real Madrid are record five-time winners of the FIFA Club World Cup.

However, such an impressive history in the competition will matter little heading into this summer's reformatted and expanded iteration of the tournament, with 32 teams from across all six continental federations fighting for world champion status. 

Madrid will undoubtedly be among the leading candidates to win the competition in its rebirth year, owing largely to their ludicrously talented squad. Despite a difficult 2024–25 season, there can be no doubting the immense talent Los Blancos boast. 

But who will be on the plane to the United States? Let's take a closer look. 

Competing clubs must travel with 26 to 35 players and Madrid submitted their official squad list on June 10 after the summer's first transfer window slammed shut. 

The Spanish giants will have an extra opportunity to add to their roster midway through the tournament, with another registration period spanning between June 27 and 3 July. In this time Madrid will be able to add no more than six players, including two that won't contribute to their final 35-man squad list. 

However, Madrid won't be able to register any players who have already competed at the tournament for another club, such as Benfica's Álvaro Carreras who is a transfer target for Los Blancos. 

Madrid have confirmed their 34-man squad for the Club World Cup, with a host of injured stars returning to the team, new signings featuring and a number of youngsters making the cut for clashes with Al Hilal, Pachuca and Salzburg.

Madrid will not only travel to the U.S. with several new players in their squad, they will jet off under new management. Xabi Alonso will oversee his first matches in charge of the club at the tournament having taken over from Carlo Ancelotti, with the Spaniard, who used to play for Los Blancos, wanting to hit the ground running. 

Alonso's first acquisitions since taking the Madrid job have been impressive, with Trent Alexander-Arnold poached from another one of his former clubs, Liverpool. The right back is currently on international duty with England but has been named in the Club World Cup squad after an agreement was reached with the Reds, who will pocket as much as £10 million ($13.5 million) by letting the defender end his contract early. 

Another Premier League defender who has teamed up with Madrid is Dean Huijsen. The former Bournemouth starlet helps ease issues at center back for Alonso and will travel to the Club World Cup. The 20-year-old will need a little time to recover after recently losing the UEFA Nations League final with Spain. 

Injuries threatened to be Madrid's greatest hurdle at the Club World Cup but a host of long-term absentees have been named in Alonso's squad. How much they can feature at the tournament remains to be seen, though. 

Éder Militão, David Alaba, Dani Carvajal, Ferland Mendy and Antonio Rüdiger have all returned in defense, while Eduardo Camavinga is available in midfield and Endrick in the forward line. The latter appeared certain to miss the trip to the United States with a hamstring injury. 

Despite their contracts expiring at the end of June, both Luka Modric and Lucas Vázquez will represent Madrid at the tournament for their final appearances before departures. Jesús Vallejo is also leaving for free at the end of the month but will not travel to the United States.

FIFA Club World Cup

Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen have been included in Real Madrid's squad for the Club World Cup.

The 15-time European champions reached an agreement with Liverpool last month for Alexander-Arnold to join early and play in FIFA's newly-expanded tournament for his new club.

Huijsen joined in a £50million ($67.7m) deal from Bournemouth and will line up in a new-look defence alongside Alexander-Arnold under head coach Xabi Alonso. The 43-year-old former midfielder was confirmed as Carlo Ancelotti's successor as Madrid head coach on May 25, signing a three-year deal with the club.

Luka Modric is also included ahead of his departure from the Bernabeu. The 39-year-old announced his exit in May and is attracting interest from Milan, as reported by The Athletic.

Lucas Vazquez will also leave after the tournament and is part of the group. The 33-year-old, who has deputised at right-back for long periods of his Madrid career, will leave following the expiration of his contract this month.

Fellow full-back Dani Carvajal, who has been sidelined since injuring his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in October, has also been selected alongside a host of youngsters including Sergio Mestre, Youssef Enriquez (Yusi), Jacobo Ramon, Jesus Fortea, Diego Aguado, Chema Andres, Mario Martin, Gonzalo Garcia and Victor Munoz.

Madrid's 2024-25 season was one of the club's most difficult domestic campaigns in recent years. They were runners-up in La Liga behind Barcelona, finishing four points behind their Clasico rivals. They also lost in the finals of the Spanish Super Cup and the Copa del Rey to Barcelona, and have lost their last four consecutive games against the Catalans. Madrid were knocked out of the Champions League by Arsenal in the quarter-finals after being beaten home and away.

Goalkeepers: Thibaut Courtois, Andriy Lunin, Fran Gonzalez, Sergio Mestre

Defenders: Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, David Alaba, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Lucas Vazquez, Fran Garcaa, Antonio Rudiger, Ferland Mendy, Dean Huijsen, Youssef Enriquez, Jacobo Ramon, Raul Asencio, Jesus Fortea, Diego Aguado

Midfielders: Jude Bellingham, Eduardo Camavinga, Fede Valverde, Luka Modric, Aurelien Tchouameni, Arda Guler, Dani Ceballos, Chema Andres, Victor Munoz, Mario Martin

Forwards: Vinicius Junior, Kylian Mbappe, Rodrygo, Endrick, Brahim Diaz, Gonzalo Garcia

Alonso has called up all the first-team players except Ferland Mendy, as the French left-back's recovery from a muscle injury is going to take longer than the rest of Madrid's sidelined players.

That is why Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, Eduardo Camavinga and Endrick are travelling to complete the final phase of their recovery with the rest of the squad.

In terms of signings, Madrid had hoped to have three available by now but so far they only have two: Huijsen and Alexander-Arnold. The third was left-back Alvaro Carreras, who Madrid are still working to sign for July but who has been included in Benfica's squad for the tournament.

Given the list of absentees, Alonso has decided to call up nine academy players to complete the squad: goalkeepers Fran Gonzalez and Sergio Mestre; defenders Youssef Enriquez (Yusi), Diego Aguado, Jacobo Ramon and Jesus Fortea, midfielders Chema Andres and Mario Martin and forwards Gonzalo Garcia and Victor Munoz.

Perhaps the most surprising of these is Martin, the 21-year-old who spent last season on loan at Real Valladolid and has been brought back before the end of his loan spell to complete the squad in midfield.

But probably the most interesting to watch is the right-back Fortea, who signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022, breaking a so-called ‘pact of non-aggression' between the city rivals. This is the first time he has been given a chance with the first team.

Strikers Garcia and Munoz, meanwhile, will be looking to impress. They have attracted interest from elsewhere and could be on the move after the tournament.

Club World Cup spaces were allocated based on performances in the Champions League over four seasons from 2020-21 up to and including this season. Madrid have lifted the Champions League twice during that time, in 2022 and 2024.

They have won the tournament a record 15 times, with Liverpool next on that list with seven triumphs.

In December 2024, FIFA agreed a deal with streaming service DAZN for the global rights to broadcast all 63 games, claiming it to be worth around $1billion. DAZN hold the option to sub-licence to local free-to-air channels.

In the United States, 24 games across the group and knockout stages will be shown on TNT Sports' cable networks TNT, TBS and truTV. Every game will be shown on TNT's streaming service.

As well as on DAZN, fans in the UK can catch 15 group games, four last-16 matches, two quarter-final games, one semi-final and the final on the free-to-air Channel 5.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Fifa ready to discuss staging 48-team Club World Cup after lobbying from Europe","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/11/fifa-48-team-club-world-cup-europe","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 16:33:00 GMT","

Big clubs concerned they are missing out financially

Winners could be paid more than £90m

Fifa will hold a consultation about expanding the Club World Cup to 48 teams in 2029 if this summer's edition is successful, after lobbying from clubs who failed to qualify for the new $1bn (£740m) tournament.

The 32-team competition kicks off in the US on Saturday and the winners will receive up to $125.8m (£93.2m) in participation and prize money for playing seven matches. That is about £25m less than Paris Saint-Germain banked from Uefa for their 17-game Champions League-winning campaign, leading to concerns from clubs who have missed out.

Barcelona, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Milan are among the big clubs with large fanbases who have not qualified and unless Fifa lifts its cap of 12 European entrants, expansion is the only way to ensure more European competitors.

Next year's men's World Cup and the 2031 Women's World Cup will involve 48 teams for the first time, so expanding the Club World Cup would be consistent with Fifa's new tournament model. Fifa sources said that although serious discussions regarding expansion had yet to take place, talks with all stakeholders about the Club World Cup's format and structure would be held after this summer's tournament.

Another possible change being pushed by Premier League clubs is increasing the cap of two clubs from one country, a restriction that led to Liverpool missing out despite meeting one of the qualifying criteria of having one of the best eight Champions League records of clubs who did not win the competition between 2021 and 2024. Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid qualified as Champions League winners during that period, with nine European clubs qualifying through Uefa rankings because Madrid won the competition twice, in 2022 and 2024.

Fifa has waived the two-per-country limit for clubs that won their continental competition in that period, leading to Brazil having four clubs from four successive Copa Libertadores victories.

The US have three clubs taking part after Los Angeles beat the Mexican side Club América in a playoff triggered by the expulsion of Club León for a breach of multi-club ownership rules.

In an interview with the Athletic last week Fifa's general secretary, Mattias Grafström, said all options were open for 2029. “For the future we are very open-minded to look at formats and so on that we will discuss with the clubs and with the confederations,” he said. “I believe strongly in the future of this competition.”

Expanding the Club World Cup would be well received in particular by European clubs, whose commercial strength and global popularity are not reflected in this year's entry list. A bigger tournament involving more of the bigger European clubs would also suit Fifa, which initially struggled to sell commercial deals for the competition.

Dazn agreed to pay $1bn for global TV rights in a deal that allows it to sublicense to other broadcasters on a regional basis, with Channel 5 buying the rights for 23 matches in the UK.

The Dazn deal is being funded by a 10% investment in the company by Saudi Arabia's SURJ Sports Investment and Saudi money is underpinning the tournament, with the country's Public Investment Fund announced as tournament partners last week. The longtime Fifa sponsors Adidas, Coca-Cola and Visa have also come on board after initially resisting. Ticket sales have been mixed, however.

Expansion would be resisted by the international players' union, Fifpro, which along with the lobby group European Leagues has filed a legal complaint to the European Commission accusing Fifa of “abuse of dominance” for allegedly failing to consult them over the scheduling of the tournament.

Fifa has denied the allegations and accused some leagues of “commercial self-interest” and “hypocrisy”. The European Commission has yet to decide whether to investigate the complaint.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

We're now exactly one year away from the biggest sporting event in the world descending on North America. But before a single ball is kicked at the 2026 World Cup next summer, there remains more than 200 nations competing in hundreds of matches to try to qualify for the tournament. It's a bit easier to qualify now, thanks to the first expansion of the competition since 1998. That year's World Cup saw the number of teams increase from 24 to 32; now, 48 teams will compete for the trophy in 2026. Even with the extra space, we've seen plenty of historically successful soccer nations miss the World Cup before (I'm looking at you, Italy), and there are bound to be a few surprises along the way. 

Here are the continental breakdowns for qualifying, which is already well underway. Thirteen teams have clinched their qualification so far, including the three host nations of Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

Forty-six teams will qualify directly for the tournament, and the remaining six teams will head to a playoff for the final two spots. To create the most accurate power rankings, I've tried to best project the remainder of the qualifying process. (Fair warning: This is borderline impossible, but it's a fun thought exercise.) As a result, the rankings are reflective of both form and talent, and they're forward-looking to the best prospects of qualifying. The bottom six are the teams I think could end up in the playoff, hence why there are 52 teams included instead of 48. The most notable omission is Nigeria, who is currently on the outside looking in as far as qualifying in Africa. 

Without further ado, here are the 52 potential World Cup teams, ranked.

Fact to know: New Caledonia is ranked 151st in the FIFA World Rankings, 65 spots lower than any other team on this list 

New Caledonia lost comfortably to New Zealand in the Oceanic playoff for the lone guaranteed World Cup spot. Now, the island nation of 290,000 people will head to two rounds of playoffs for one of the final few spots in the tournament. They'll be heavy underdogs to reach the final 48, but that's why we play the game. The majority of their roster plays domestically in the New Caledonian league, and a handful play in the French lower leagues. 

Star man: Darwin Cerén (Águila)

Fact to know: El Salvador has qualified for the World Cup twice (1970, 1982) but has lost all six of its group-stage matches

The fact that CONCACAF, a fairly weak confederation, could get eight teams in the 2026 World Cup is probably the biggest argument against expanding the World Cup field. That being said, CONCACAF will send two teams to the inter-confederation playoff in addition to its six auto qualifiers. El Salvador is in the glob of teams who could well end up in the playoff. El Salvador was placed into the most interesting Gold Cup group—with Canada, Honduras, and Curacao—this summer, which will give us a good look at how they stack up when the competition kicks off on June 14. 

Star man: Anthony Lozano (Santos Laguna)

Fact to know: Honduras has qualified for three World Cups in its history, most recently in 2014

Honduras couldn't hold on to their lead in the second leg of the Nations League quarterfinals against Mexico in November, but their 2-0 win in the first leg caught my eye. The Hondurans will have a shot to qualify directly into the field of 48, given that there's not much of a gap between teams they're competing with in the region. The Hondurans have never won a World Cup match before, and while they're ultimately unlikely to qualify, CONCACAF is the land of opportunity in this World Cup cycle.

Star man: Al Al-Hamadi (Ipswich Town)

Fact to know: Iraq has made one World Cup appearance, in 1986

The ninth and final team from Asia will have to go through the inter-confederation playoffs. Given the depth of opposition in South America and Africa, odds are this ninth Asian team will not actually make it into the final 48. Iraq was beaten twice by South Korea during qualifying, but they did pull off an upset against Japan during the Asian Cup last year, which led to them winning their group during group play. 

Star man: Yoane Wissa (Brentford)

Fact to know: Then known as Zaire, DR Congo was the first sub-Saharan team to ever qualify for the World Cup in 1974

They're currently in a tough battle with Senegal for first place in their qualifying group, but DR Congo will be one of the favorites to claim the last African spot if they do fall out of the top spot. They've been defensively stout in qualifying thus far, conceding just two goals in six matches. DR Congo is fresh off a solid showing in the last African Cup of Nations (AFCON), where they knocked out Egypt and Guinea before losing to eventual champion Ivory Coast in the semifinal. 

Star man: Salomón Rondón (Pachuca)

Fact to know: Venezuela is the only CONMEBOL side to never qualify for the World Cup

Whichever South American team ends up in the playoff will instantly become a clear favorite to make the field of 48. Venezuela is most likely to be that team, and they're coming off an impressive showing at the Copa Ámerica last summer. They won all three matches in their group against Ecuador, Mexico, and Jamaica—all teams likely to qualify for this World Cup. We reserved the bottom six teams in these rankings for the likely playoff spots, but Venezuela is actually talented enough to potentially reach the knockouts of the World Cup proper, depending on their group. 

Star man: Chris Wood (Nottingham Forest)

Fact to know: New Zealand finished ahead of Italy in their group at the 2010 World Cup in their last tournament appearance, but still failed to advance to the knockout round

New Zealand confirmed its place in the World Cup with a 3-0 win against New Caledonia. You could argue that no nation has benefited more from the expanded field than New Zealand, who is consistently the best team in OFC but will be one of the lowest FIFA-ranked teams in the tournament. Club-wise, New Zealand has players scattered across the globe, but none are more renowned than Nottingham Forest striker Chris Wood. He has 44 career goals for the Kiwis and scored an impressive 20 goals in the Premier League this past season.

Star man: Francisco Calvo (Hatayspor)

Fact to know: Costa Rica is the last CONCACAF team to advance past the round of 16 in a World Cup, as they were quarterfinalists in 2014 

This is not your older brother's Costa Rica squad. They always seem to be in the mix in these international tournaments—they beat Japan in the group of death at Qatar 2022 and tied Brazil at the Copa Ámerica last summer. Unfortunately, Costa Rica's overall talent level is headed in the wrong direction following a golden generation that brought so much success at the international level.

They have had a strong start in CONCACAF qualifying thus far, but trying to figure out which teams will qualify behind the clear top four in the confederation (Panama and the three hosts) is a difficult task right now. Goalkeeper Keylor Navas, 38, once of Real Madrid and PSG fame, captained the side in a qualifying win against the Bahamas last week.

Star man: Leon Bailey (Aston Villa)

Fact to know: Former Newcastle manager and Manchester United assistant Steve McClaren is the manager of Jamaica

The Reggae Boyz have made the World Cup once in their history and just missed out on the knockout round in 1998. Leon Bailey had a public feud with the top brass in the Jamaican soccer apparatus, but it appears they've moved on and settled their dispute. Jamaica was placed in arguably the most balanced group at Copa Ámerica (Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela) and still lost all three games. They've again been placed in a fairly even group at this summer's Gold Cup and we'll get to see if they can advance in a group with Guadeloupe, Panama, and Guatemala. 

Leon Bailey and Demarai Gray are two wide forwards that give Jamaica a real threat playing on the break and in transition. 

Star man: Khalid Eisa (Al Ain)

Fact to know: The United Arab Emirates have qualified for the World Cup once (1990), but lost all three matches

It's difficult to sort out who will claim the remaining spots in Asian qualifying, with six teams headed to the final round for the final three Asian places in the field of 52 (with the addition of playoffs). I picked UAE along with the next team on this list simply because they have the best goal difference of the likely playoff teams during the current qualifying round. UAE's run at the Asian Cup last year ended earlier than expected with a round of 16 penalty shootout loss to Tajikistan. 

The margins between the Asian teams in this tier are tiny, but UAE do have a higher Transfermarkt squad value than Iran, who is one of the top teams on the continent. 

Star man: Firas Al-Buraikan (Al Ahli)

Fact to know: Hervé Renard is back as Saudi Arabia manager after leading them at the last World Cup

Saudi Arabia's win against Argentina in their opening game of the 2022 World Cup is legitimately one of the biggest upsets in world soccer history. Hervé Renard's leaked halftime speech to the dressing room has become famous worldwide. Renard is a well-respected international manager who has successfully coached throughout Africa as well as the French women's national team. 

Odds are Saudi Arabia won't top the win against Argentina in this World Cup, and they are still far from assured a qualifying place. Their guest Gold Cup appearance this summer will present real opportunities for Renard to mold the team in his image before the key qualifying playoff matches this fall. Saudi Arabia plays the United States on June 19 in the second group game. 

Star man: Mousa Tamari (Rennes)

Fact to know: Jordan is making its World Cup debut in 2026

Jordan is in the midst of their best-ever run as a soccer-playing nation right now. Not only will they be World Cup debutants, but they also made a run to the Asian Cup final in 2023. They ultimately lost to host nation Qatar, but not without beating Iraq and South Korea en route to the final. It was one of the most fascinating runs in recent tournament history, as Jordan scored twice in stoppage time to beat Iraq in the round of 16, won on an own goal in the quarterfinal against Tajikistan, but then lost the final by conceding three penalties to Qatar. Jordan will hope to be just as entertaining in North America next summer. 

Star man: Abdukodir Khusanov (Manchester City)

Fact to know: Uzbekistan is making its World Cup debut in 2026

Roma's Eldor Shomurodov, who captains the Uzbekistan national team, tallied four goals and four assists for Roma in Serie A this season, and Abdukodir Khusanov earned a big-money move to Manchester City in January. Those are the two key players propping up Uzbekistan and leading their squad into the World Cup. They played Iran to a draw in both qualifying matches, which should provide some optimism for their chances to be competitive in their debutant appearance next summer.

 

Star man: Bongokuhle Hlongwane (Minnesota United)

Fact to know: South Africa was the first African nation to host the World Cup. Morocco will cohost with Spain and Portugal in 2030.

South Africa hasn't been to the World Cup since it hosted the event in 2010. They've been to the tournament three times in total (all since 1998) and have never advanced past the group stage. In many ways, they are a surprise contender. When they were paired up with African heavyweight Nigeria in their qualifying group, they started as sizable underdogs to make this list. However, South Africa has a five-point lead over Rwanda and six points over Nigeria with four matches to play. 

Mark your calendars: The most important game is in September, when South Africa hosts Nigeria. If the South Africans can manage at least a draw, the math gets nearly impossible for Nigeria to catch them. 

Star man: Adalberto Carrasquilla (UNAM)

Fact to know: Panama first qualified for the World Cup in 2018 but lost all three games with a minus-9 goal differential

Fortunately for the United States, and maybe unfortunately for Panama, the Americans cannot be placed in a group with Panama at the World Cup since they hail from the same confederation. The Panamanians played a decisive role in knocking out the U.S. in the Copa Ámerica last year, then followed that up by knocking out the U.S. directly in the semifinal of the Nations League in March. Panama is the clear fourth-strongest team in North America right now, behind the three hosts of 2026 and ahead of challengers Costa Rica and Jamaica. Panama beat Costa Rica 3-2 on aggregate when the two nations matched up in the Nations League quarterfinals.

All that said, Panama's 5-0 defeat to Colombia in the Copa Àmerica quarterfinal and their 3-1 loss to Uruguay in the group stage shows that there is a sizable gap between Panama and the next tier of competitors in the World Cup.

Star man: Mathew Ryan (Lens)

Fact to know: Australia advanced from their group in the 2022 World Cup over Denmark and Tunisia before losing to eventual champions Argentina

Australia won the Asian Cup in 2015 under then-manager Ange Postecoglou. They've since lost in the quarterfinals in the last two editions in 2019 and 2023. Australia is a difficult team to rank because their Transfermarkt squad values would place them 71st in the world, while FIFA has them 26th in its official rankings. The reality is somewhere in the middle, as they've frequently been a competitive World Cup team in past cycles.

Star man: Mohammed Kudus (West Ham)

Fact to know: Ghana knocked out the United States from the 2006 and 2010 World Cups, but the U.S. got revenge in 2014 on a famous John Brooks header

Ghana's golden generation from 2006-14 aged out, but after failing to qualify in 2018, Ghana returned to the World Cup in 2022. Now, they have a talented squad with a handful of European regulars ready to challenge again for a place in the knockout stage. The breakout season from Antoine Semenyo at Bournemouth gives Ghana another attacking threat on the opposite flank from star man Mohammed Kudus. 

Qualifying rival Mali has underachieved thus far in their group, which leaves Ghana in first place, three points ahead of surprise package Comoros with four matches to play. 

Star man: Alphonso Davies (Bayern Munich)

Fact to know: Canadian manager Jesse Marsch is an American, and he often likes to remind the U.S. Soccer Federation of that 

You could make a case that Canada is actually the second-most talented North American squad from top to bottom, ahead of Mexico. With attacking fullback Davies and striker Jonathan David, the Canadians have maybe the two best players in the entire confederation. They have a clear playing style and have fully adopted Marsch's high-intensity tactics, but I'm also not overreacting to Canada's run to the semifinal of the Copa América last year. It was a successful tournament, but the Canadians really struggled to score goals when it mattered. They lost 2-0 to Mexico in the Nations League semifinal in March, too. 

Star man: Hannibal Mejbri (Burnley)

Fact to know: Tunisia finished dead last in its AFCON group in 2023 and failed to reach the knockout stage 

Tunisia has played six matches in World Cup qualifying and still hasn't conceded a goal. It hasn't been a difficult group, with the likes of Namibia and Liberia as opposition, but the Tunisians are on the path to a seamless qualification. Tunisia pulled off a shocking upset against France and tied Denmark at the last World Cup, but it still wasn't enough to advance because of a loss to Australia. There's not a ton of goal-scoring firepower in this squad, but it is an organized defensive outfit that has proved difficult to break down on the global stage. 

Tunisia will play in the same group as Nigeria in the Africa Cup of Nations this winter. The last AFCON didn't go as planned, but this match will be a compelling test for them prior to next summer. Their most recent measuring-stick match was a 2-0 friendly defeat to Morocco.

Star man: Riyad Mahrez (Al-Ahli)

Fact to know: According to oddsmakers, Algeria is tied for second (along with Egypt) to win AFCON in January 

After a solid 2023 AFCON showing, Guinea has really underperformed in World Cup qualifying. That has opened the door for Algeria to return to the World Cup for the first time since it took eventual champion Germany to extra time in the 2014 knockout stage. Algeria is in first place with a three-point lead over Mozambique, and the two sides have no more head-to-head matchups left on the qualifying calendar. 

With Rayan Ait-Nouri—who's recently earned a big move to Manchester City—Ramy Bensebaini, and Mahrez, the Algerians will be very dangerous moving the ball up the field in wide areas and creating chances via crossing. They have a handful of Big Five European league regulars and shouldn't be overlooked. 

Star man: Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)

Fact to know: Seven players on the current Egyptian squad play domestically for Al Ahly, who are in the Club World Cup this summer  

Egypt has made the World Cup only once in Mo Salah's career, and it lost all three of its games in 2018. The question has always been about the talent surrounding Salah and whether it's good enough to supplement him. With the breakout season from Manchester City's Omar Marmoush, Egypt now has a secondary scoring option to add to Salah's production. The team needs both of its stars to be healthy to have any chance of reaching its potential because the depth otherwise is uninspiring.

As long as Egypt avoids defeat at Burkina Faso in its September match, it should have no issues qualifying. A loss could make their World Cup status a bit more dicey. 

Star man: Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)

Fact to know: Since a shock quarterfinal run in 1990, Cameroon has been eliminated in the group stage of the last six World Cups it qualified for

Cameroon still faces a bit of a challenge to qualify for the tournament, as it is one point behind Cape Verde in the standings with four matches to play and has to travel to play at Cape Verde in another head-to-head match. Cameroon won the reverse fixture 4-1 at home, so I am making a bit of an assumption that it'll surpass the Cape Verdeans in the final matches. 

With Mbeumo, Carlos Baleba, and André Onana, Cameroon has regular starters across the pitch in the Premier League. There are no top Champions League regulars in the squad, but they have enough depth to make noise next summer.

 

Star man: Simon Adingra (Brighton & Hove Albion)

Fact to know: Ivory Coast has the best goal difference of an African team in qualifying so far

Bona fide legends Yaya Touré and Didier Drogba are no longer lacing their boots for the Ivory Coast, but there's still a lot of talent on this roster. The team's run through the AFCON last year was one of the most interesting stories in sports in 2024. They fired their manager mid-tournament for poor performances and went on to win the whole damn thing with the interim coach. 

The problem for past Ivorian teams was a reliance on just a couple of stars. This team doesn't have any major stars, but there are a lot of players at clubs in top-five leagues across Europe. That golden generation of Touré and Drogba never made a World Cup knockout stage, but this group will have a real chance to do that for the first time. 

Star man: Robert Lewandowski (Barcelona)

Fact to know: Lewandowski has said he won't play for Poland as long as Michal Probierz is the manager 

Poland has been consistently good at qualifying for major tournaments and consistently bad at achieving much in said tournaments. It finished last in a difficult group at Euro 2024 and last in its group in Euro 2020. The 2022 World Cup was the lone breakthrough for the Poles in recent memory as they advanced to the round of 16 over Mexico and Saudi Arabia before falling to France. 

They'll be battling it out with the Netherlands for the automatic qualifying spot, but they'll also be one of the favorites to advance through the playoff if necessary. If Lewandowski actually sits out, the team's chances of qualifying could be dicey. Or they could just fire the manager. It's safe to say Lewandowski is more critical than Probierz to Poland's chances of qualifying at this point. A 2-1 loss to Finland on Tuesday won't help their chances. 

Star man: Julio Enciso (Ipswich Town)

Fact to know: Paraguay last qualified for the World Cup in 2010 and made the quarterfinal

Paraguay's collection of talent doesn't stand out in South America, and it didn't perform well in its Copa América group last summer, finishing last, behind Costa Rica, Colombia, and Brazil. However, CONMEBOL qualifying is the most grueling of them all, and Paraguay still sits in an automatic qualifying place. Goal scoring has been an issue for them in past cycles, but the emergence of Enciso has given them a primary creator to focus their team around. 

Star man: Mehdi Taremi (Inter Milan)

Fact to know: Iran has consistently been the first- or second-best Asian team in FIFA rankings, but it lost in the semifinals of the last two Asian Cups in 2019 and 2023

Iran came up just short of advancing to the knockout stage in each of the last two World Cups, but it has gone toe-to-toe with the United States, Spain, and Portugal in past matchups. Iran was one of the top contenders to win the 2023 Asian Cup until it lost in an upset (3-2) to host nation Qatar in the semifinals. Now in their fourth consecutive World Cup, the Iranians are still looking for their first trip to the knockout round. 

Iran feels like it's on the precipice of breaking through globally. The expanded format could finally get them a knockout game, but it's hard to see much more than that. 

Star man: Edson Álvarez (West Ham)

Fact to know: El Tri has four players in Europe's top five leagues right now—Álvarez, Raúl Jiménez (Fulham), Santiago Giménez (AC Milan), and Johan Vásquez (Genoa) 

Mexico won the CONCACAF Nations League in March, beating Canada and Panama en route to the trophy. It was a much-needed boost to a team that had been in steady decline. Not only did the Mexicans get grouped at the World Cup for the first time in the 21st century in 2022, but they followed it up with a loss to Venezuela that led them to get grouped in the Copa América last summer. The Gold Cup will be an opportunity for a third straight confederation trophy, but the team is still less talented than the United States at the moment.  

The home-field advantage is sure to play a part for the Mexicans in the North American summer heat. They'll be looking to bottle up striker Giménez's club form for AC Milan and translate it to the national team. 

Star man: Heung-min Son (Tottenham Hotspur)

Fact to know: Son needs eight goals to break Cha Bum-kun's all-time South Korean goal-scoring record of 58

South Korea finished the Asian World Cup qualifiers unbeaten in 10 matches and will carry a wealth of talent from Europe's top five leagues to North America next summer. Son and Bayern's Kim-min Jae have been well-known European regulars for years now, and they will be looking to build on the late heroics that saw them reach the round of 16 at the last World Cup. 

Star man: Christian Pulisic (AC Milan)

Fact to know: The United States conceded four goals in the first half of Tuesday's friendly against Switzerland for the first time since 1980

The team's form under Mauricio Pochettino certainly hasn't been encouraging. The United States has shown clear regression since their quality round of 16 showing at the 2022 World Cup, and it's not obvious that the Americans have any real solutions for their lack of center back depth or goalkeeper issues. But it's important to note that the U.S. teams that recently lost to Panama, Canada, Türkiye, and Switzerland didn't have the United States' best possible 11 on the roster. The team relies so heavily on fullbacks Antonee Robinson and Sergino Dest to create chances and move the ball forward that the absence of both has created real problems in recent matches. 

I have so many questions about the state of the USMNT. They'll be playing games at home, but is that even a huge advantage right now, given the general malaise of the national team? Is it possible for the Americans to gain some momentum between now and next June? Why can't the United States get Chris Richards, Malik Tillman, and Johnny Cardoso to replicate their quality club performances for the national team? Will goalkeeper Matt Turner be able to land a starting spot at the club level so that he can remain sharp heading into the World Cup? There are lots of questions to ponder.

 

Star man: Erling Haaland (Manchester City)

Fact to know: I've officially declared them “everyone's favorite dark horse that isn't actually a dark horse”

Norway hasn't been to the World Cup since the 1998 edition. They are well on their way to qualification following a 3-0 demolition of Italy at home last week. If they take care of business against group minnows Moldova and Estonia, they'll qualify directly as group winners. 

Norway hasn't even been to the Euros since 2000, but they have a really talented core right now. Haaland is one of the best goal scorers on the planet, and his link-up play with primary creator Martin Ødegaard is as good as that of any one-two attacking combination in the world. It's not just those two powering the current squad, though. Norway starts four Premier League regulars, plus Borussia Dortmund right back Julian Ryerson and Atlético Madrid super sub Alexander Sørloth. They'll be a popular dark horse next summer because of their pool of goal scorers and playmakers.

Star man: Boulaye Dia (Lazio)

Fact to know: Senegal is one of three African countries on this list, along with Morocco and Tunisia, that is expected to qualify for three consecutive World Cups

Goal scoring has been an issue for Senegal throughout World Cup qualifying, as they have tallied just eight goals in six matches. The defense remains an excellent unit—it's allowed just one goal—but the team has registered a string of draws, putting it a point behind DR Congo in its qualifying group. 

This combination of attackers—Sadio Mané, Ismaila Sarr, Boulaye Dia, and Iliman Ndaiye—has goals in them, but there's a lack of creators to give them chances, which hurt Senegal in 2022 and could now put their chances of qualification in moderate danger.  

Star man: Alessandro Bastoni (Inter Milan)

Fact to know: Italy lost to North Macedonia in a 2022 World Cup playoff match and missed the tournament as a result

Italy is one of the toughest teams to rank in the whole field because their World Cup chances are in peril following a 3-0 defeat to Norway in their first qualifying match. The Italians have two games in hand, but they are still nine points behind Norway and 12 goals behind them in goal difference. It will be very difficult for the Italians to qualify directly at this point, so they'll likely need to go through the playoffs (16 teams for four spots) to make the World Cup. 

You'd still want to trust the defensive and midfield talent of Italy if they manage to get into the competition, but they've been reliably mediocre since winning the Euros in 2021. Key attacking players Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne aren't around anymore, and Federico Chiesa is currently not in the squad after a disappointing (and injury-filled) season with Liverpool. Even Italy's Euro 2024 performance isn't particularly inspiring. They equalized with Croatia in the final minute of a group stage match but were comfortably outplayed by Spain and knocked out by Switzerland in the round of 16. It seems like Italy should be happy to even just make the World Cup, and if they get in, it's hard to see them making a real run. 

Star man: Alexander Isak (Newcastle)

Fact to know: Sweden's Euro 2024 qualifying play was such a disaster that they finished nine points behind Austria and 10 behind Belgium, failing to make the playoff round

Sweden's Euros qualifying campaign was a calamity, but if you're simply looking at their squad on paper, they jump off the page as a really talented team. The strike partnership of Viktor Gyokeres and Isak, along with the pair of Tottenham midfielders Lucas Bergvall and Dejan Kulusevski, looks like the core of a really competitive team. The questions are at the other end of the pitch, where there's considerably less top European talent. In a competitive group with the reliable Swiss and organized Slovenia, Sweden's path to the final 48 isn't obvious. But if they do end up in a playoff, in theory they'll be one of the most capable teams. 

After failing to qualify for the 2022 World Cup and 2024 Euros, Sweden now has a lot of in-form club players. Isak in particular stands out, having finished second behind Mohamed Salah in the Premier League Golden Boot race with 23 goals.

Star man: Arda Guler (Real Madrid)

Fact to know: Everyone will pick them as their dark horse next June, as is tradition 

The next three teams on this list all face real challenges in qualifying for the World Cup because of how difficult the path is in UEFA. Türkiye were paired with Spain in qualifying and will almost certainly finish second in the group as a result. That means they'll probably go to the playoff, but they do have as much talent as anyone in that pool of competition. We saw the highs and lows of Türkiye in the Euros, where they lost sloppily to Portugal but beat Austria in a thriller. Consecutive dominant Nations League wins against Hungary in March portend well for a potential World Cup playoff. 

As always with Türkiye, the question is about defense. But with midfielders Guler and Hakan Calhanoglu and a bunch of intriguing attacking dribblers, they'll be a difficult team to beat, should they make the field. A true wild card, as always. 

Star man: Marcel Sabitzer (Borussia Dortmund)

Fact to know: Austria hasn't been to the World Cup since 1998

My Euro 2024 dark horse squad is back for another major tournament under manager Ralf Rangnick and his high-intensity pressing tactics. The Austrians ultimately went out in a thriller against Türkiye in the round of 16, but not without beating the Netherlands and Poland first. Their form has been a little less consistent in the Nations League since, but Rangnick generally has them performing above their talent level. 

They'll point to a 5-1 win against Norway in the Nations League to show that they remain a real threat in this second tier of European contenders. Bosnia and Herzegovina is off to a great start in the qualifying group, though, and is currently sitting in first, so there's work for Austria to do. 

Star man: Joško Gvardiol (Manchester City)

Fact to know: It should come as no surprise that Luka Modric is Croatia's all-time leader in appearances, with 188

I thought that Croatia's aging core would be too old to run it back at the 2022 World Cup, and then they made it to the semifinals. Maybe the age of this squad finally caught up to them in the 2024 Euros, where they crashed out in the group stage, but they've given a good account of themselves in their Nations League matchups since then. They didn't advance against France in the quarterfinals, but taking one of the best teams in the world to penalties isn't a bad result. During the group stage, Croatia beat Poland, drew with Portugal, and were generally competitive in each of their matches. 

Croatia thrashed current World Cup qualifying group leaders Czechia on Monday, 5-1, and are now the clear favorite to finish in first place, given that they have two games over the Czechs in hand. The health and fitness of Modric and Mateo Kovacic will be the key to the outcomes of Croatia's aging midfield in one last dance.

    

Star man: Mikkel Damsgaard (Brentford)

Fact to know: Christian Eriksen has appeared 143 times for Denmark, the most of any Dane in history

Denmark hasn't yet begun their World Cup qualifying campaign, but they'll have to like their chances since they're in a group with Scotland, Belarus, and Greece. The Danes probably lack the high-profile talent to make a run to the World Cup quarterfinals and beyond, but they are a consistently reliable B-tier European team with an entire lineup of regulars from the big five leagues. 

The Danes weren't particularly impressive at the 2024 Euros, with three draws in three games against Slovenia, England, and Serbia, but they showed that they remain a quality defensive outfit. You should expect them not only to qualify for the World Cup, but also to get out of their group. Keep an eye out for the continued development and emergence of Brentford's Damsgaard. His creative production took a major leap in the Premier League last season, as he notched 10 assists—tied for fourth most in the league. 

Star man: Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad)

Fact to know: Japan became the first non-hosting team to qualify for the 2026 World Cup when they beat Bahrain in March 

Morocco's run to the semifinals at the 2022 World Cup took up all of the Cinderella oxygen, but Japan was nearly as fascinating in that tournament. They beat Spain and Germany thanks to elite out of possession defending and excellent direct counterattacking. They also lost to Costa Rica, one of the weakest teams in the tournament. Japan still profiles as something of a scrappy, transitional team, but they'll be a pesky underdog against whichever top favorite they meet. 

The Japanese had a very smooth path through the qualifiers in Asia, with just three goals conceded in 10 matches. They just smacked Indonesia 6-0 on Tuesday. With the likes of Kubo, Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma, and Liverpool's Wataru Endō, Japan have more talent on paper than the majority of the Asian teams headed to the World Cup. 

Star man: Moisés Caicedo (Chelsea)

Fact to know: This is only the fifth time Ecuador has ever reached the World Cup. They've had just one knockout appearance, in 2006.

What is the second-best team in South America? If you went by talent, you'd probably say Brazil. If you went by recent Copa Ámerica results, you could make a case for Colombia. But what if I told you that the second-best team—at least in World Cup qualifying—was actually Ecuador? They have allowed five total goals in 16 matches and have totaled the second-most points, behind Argentina. Ecuador also came the closest to beating Argentina at the Copa Ámerica last year, when they lost to Emiliano Martinez in a penalty shoot-out. 

The Ecuadoreans aren't flashy or particularly impressive on paper. But they have lost only twice in qualifying. Bayer Leverkusen's Piero Hincapié, PSG's Willian Pacho, Chelsea's Caicedo, and Brighton's Pervis Estupiñán make up a really solid defensive core. 

Star man: Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City, for now, but probably Napoli soon)

Fact to know: Romelu Lukaku has had 89 goals for Belgium in his career, which is more than double any other Belgian in history. Kevin De Bruyne is third with 31. 

We're well past the golden generation of Belgian stars who emerged in the mid-2010s, but that doesn't mean Belgium is no longer a player on the world stage. De Bruyne's time as a Premier League star is likely coming to an end, but he's still one of the most creative and technically gifted passers in the world. His game is well suited to international tournaments. The same is true for box-to-box midfielder Youri Tielemans. There will certainly be questions about how the Belgians will defend next summer—the top-level talent is lacking there—but a team with elite dribbler Jeremy Doku, De Bruyne, Tielemans, and the enigmatic Lukaku (who bagged 24 goal contributions in Serie A for title winner Napoli) will have no issues producing chances. 

Belgium was put in a pretty friendly qualifying group with North Macedonia, Wales, Kazakhstan, and Liechtenstein and should have no issues directly qualifying. They're not a contender to win the whole thing, but a deep underdog run can't be counted out. 

Star man: Achraf Hakimi (PSG)

Fact to know: Morocco made history by becoming the first African team to reach the semifinals of a World Cup in 2022

The Cinderella darlings of the 2022 World Cup are back with a similarly talented core group of players, as well as the same manager, Walid Regragui. Morocco rode its disciplined defensive structure and quality counterattacking to victories against Belgium, Spain, and Portugal in Qatar. They ultimately lost to France in the semifinal. Then, naturally, they followed that up with a shocking 2-0 loss to South Africa in the round of 16 of AFCON 2023. Still, Morocco's World Cup run is further proof that you don't need to dominate possessions to be successful in the international game, and having the ball is often overrated when analyzing team quality. 

With five wins in the first five qualifying matches, Morocco is on a path to comfortable qualification for the World Cup. Morocco is hosting AFCON 2025 in December, which will give African teams major preparation for the tournament. 

Star man: Granit Xhaka (Bayer Leverkusen)

Fact to know: I'm still expecting Xherdan Shaqiri to show up and score his usual banger out of nowhere, but he has indeed retired from the national team

Switzerland has been the pinnacle of consistency in past World Cups. It's lost in the round of 16 in four of the past five tournaments. The main core of players that defined the recent generation has aged a bit, but younger reinforcements helped push the team to the quarterfinals at the 2024 Euros. Switzerland dominated Italy and outplayed England last summer and came within a penalty shoot-out of the semifinal. Emerging winger Dan Ndoye and dynamite forward Breel Embolo provide the Swiss with a decent amount of attacking talent. 

They're not flashy or particularly impressive on paper, but Switzerland has always been a cohesive squad anchored by the still reliable Xhaka and Remo Freuler in midfield. Manchester City centerback Manuel Akanji gives them real pedigree on defense. Switzerland was placed in a competitive qualifying group with Sweden and Slovenia but will back themselves to finish in the top spot. 

Star man: Federico Valverde (Real Madrid)

Fact to know: Uruguay has roughly the same population as Connecticut and is the smallest—and first!—nation to ever win the World Cup

After losing in the 2021 Copa Ámerica quarterfinals and following it up with a World Cup group stage exit in 2022, Uruguay brought on Marcelo Bielsa to help the proud footballing nation rediscover its identity. They lost a tightly contested Copa semifinal to Colombia last summer, but beating the United States and Brazil in that tournament was a step in the right direction. 

Uruguay's path through CONMEBOL qualifying has been more of a mixed bag. They began well but now have had just two wins in their 11 games since the Copa Ámerica. The reason to bet on Uruguay is the team's overall talent. They have a ton of midfield quality and depth from Real Madrid's Valverde, Tottenham's Rodrigo Bentancur, and Manchester United's Manuel Ugarte, among others. It's a hardworking group that presses with relentless energy and defends well. The form of enigmatic attacker Darwin Núñez could be the key to Uruguay's goal-scoring explosiveness—because right now, it looks like they'll be playing a lot of low-scoring grinders in the World Cup.

 

Star man: Luis Diáz (Liverpool)

Fact to know: James Rodríguez is second of all time in goals for Colombia, with 29, behind only Radamel Falcao 

After missing out on Qatar 2022, Colombia has been one of the best teams in international football for three years. They went unbeaten in 28 consecutive matches before losing the Copa Ámerica final to Argentina in extra time last summer. Since that final, they've had a significant downturn in form. Colombia has had just one win in eight matches in CONMEBOL qualifying since October, and they've dropped to sixth in the table—the final spot for automatic qualification. They're safe for now, but a loss at Venezuela in the final round of qualifying matches in September could see them fall to the inter-confederation playoff. 

It's been 11 years since Rodríguez broke onto the world scene with his sensational performance at the 2014 World Cup. Rodríguez can't run like he used to and plays club soccer in the relatively weak Mexican league, but he's still a superb dead-ball specialist, and he was the best player in the Copa Àmerica last summer. 

Star man: Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool)

Fact to know: The Dutch have lost all three World Cup finals they've played in; they're the only nation to have reached three finals with no wins

The Netherlands made it to the 2024 Euro semifinals even though their first-choice midfielders, Frenkie de Jong and Teun Koopmeiners, weren't available. Without those two, the Dutch struggled to control games. With those central midfielders now fit and attacking midfielders Tijjani Reijnders and Xavi Simons joining them in the lineup, the Dutch are a well-balanced team with a ton of defensive experience and enough attacking output to challenge the elite tier of contenders in the World Cup. 

Cody Gakpo has been good but not great in his time at Liverpool, but he's been a major international tournament star for the Dutch. He scored three goals at the 2022 World Cup and three in last year's Euros—plus, he created the late winner that was ruled an own goal in the quarterfinal against Türkiye.

The Dutch kicked off their qualifying campaign with a comfortable 2-0 win against Finland and are favorites to win their group and qualify directly. 

Star man: Vinicius Júnior (Real Madrid)

Fact to know: Brazil has made at least the quarterfinals in every World Cup since 1994

Don Carlo Ancelotti will be Brazil's fourth manager (including caretakers) of this World Cup cycle since Tite's departure after Qatar. It's easy to forget just how quickly everything turned for Brazil during and after the 2022 World Cup. When Neymar scored an incredible team goal in extra time against Croatia, that was supposed to set up a historic clash with Argentina in the semifinal. Brazil was the oddsmakers' favorite to win the World Cup at the time. But then they conceded a late equalizer to Croatia, lost in the penalty shoot-out, and haven't been the same since. 

Neymar's torn ACL and the team's managerial uncertainty contributed to a poor showing at the Copa Ámerica. Brazil drew with Costa Rica and Colombia in the group stage before losing to Uruguay in the quarterfinal. Brazil could probably field two different teams of players who'd be competitive in this World Cup, but it's not clear what the best 11 is. They've won just two of their last six in qualifying, and Vinicius Júnior and Raphina are the only locked-down starters among their main attackers. 

Star man: Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen)

Fact to know: Former German striker Miroslav Klose holds the record for most goals scored in World Cup tournaments (16)

Germany ultimately lost at home to Spain in the Euro 2024 quarterfinals, but that was the highest-quality match of the tournament. Germany has failed to escape the group stage of the past two World Cups and also lost in the round of 16 at Euro 2021. By the time the World Cup kicks off, we won't have seen the Germans in the semifinals of a major tournament in a decade (since their Euro 2016 loss to France). 

Germany is spearheaded by two attacking midfield superstars, Jamal Musiala and Wirtz. Manager Julian Nagelsmann plays a system that enables both to get on the ball a ton, and the technical quality of the German midfield and attack is sublime. Yet questions about the strikers and the defense that have plagued Germany for a decade will likely still exist entering 2026. The combination of Kai Havertz and Niclas Fullkrug up top was decent but not great last summer. But the emergence and development of Stuttgart forward Nick Woltemade is a major thing to watch between now and next year. 

Nagelsmann is an excellent tactician, and Germany has a sky-high ceiling. But the defense just conceded eight goals in four games against Italy (twice), Portugal, and France. They'll need to shore things up if they want any chance of going deep next year.

Star man: Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United)

Fact to know: Cristiano Ronaldo is Portugal's all-time leading goal scorer, with 138 goals. Second place has 47. 

Even though they won the Nations League on Sunday in an Iberian clash with Spain, Portugal's future is uncertain. Will Cristiano Ronaldo be leading the line next summer, when he's 41? Ronaldo was detrimental to Portugal's performance in the 2024 Euros, but he's been productive in recent qualifying matches and scored the crucial equalizer on Sunday. It's a difficult decision because the squad has a lot of talented attacking players, but on the other hand … it's Ronaldo. 

The other question is about the team's manager. Rumors have been flying that Roberto Martínez may not lead Portugal next summer, even though he delivered the trophy on Sunday. Could José Mourinho join his native country's team? Given the squad's talent, you'd maybe want a more possession-based manager, but you can't deny Mourinho's tournament bona fides. Of the top 10 teams in these rankings, Portugal is the most difficult to judge. A new manager and tactical approach could unlock so much in this team, considering the passing range of Vitinha, Bernardo Silva, and Fernandes. They also have the rangy defending of Joao Neves, the left back marauding of Nuno Mendes, and a reliable goalkeeper in Diogo Costa. 

Based on its talent level, Portugal underperformed in the 2022 World Cup and 2024 Euros. They'll be back with one of the most stacked rosters again next summer, but there's a lot to iron out before then.  

Star man: Harry Kane (Bayern Munich)

Fact to know: England didn't qualify for the World Cup in 1994, when it was last hosted in America

It's a new era of English football under manager Thomas Tuchel. Or maybe it will just be more of the same. England and Gareth Southgate parted ways after the team lost the final of the 2024 Euros. It was hard to criticize the results Southgate achieved: consecutive Euro finals and a World Cup quarterfinal and semifinal appearance. But it was easy to argue with the team's performances during his tenure. Few teams were less imaginative in possession and less inspiring at goal scoring (given their talent) than Southgate's England. 

England had issues producing anything from the left side of the pitch in the 2024 Euros. The emergence of Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly as a hyper-versatile left back could be key to fixing this issue. The next challenge: Can Tuchel solve the fact that England's key attacking players—Kane, Jude Bellingham, Cole Palmer, and Phil Foden—so often like to occupy the same spaces? And will super-passer Trent Alexander-Arnold, fresh off a dream move to Real Madrid, now have a place on this team after the departure of Southgate, who never really favored him? There's a ton of talent and depth on this squad for Tuchel to tinker with, but England is still looking for the right chemistry and mix of attacking dynamism and defensive solidity.

 

Star man: Kylian Mbappé (Real Madrid)

Fact to know: France finished third in the 2025 UEFA Nations League, beating Germany on Sunday

France made it to the semifinals at the 2024 Euros but was still one of the most disappointing teams: They scored only four total goals across six games—and three of them were either own goals and penalties. Their recent Nations League performances against Croatia in the first leg of the quarterfinal and Spain in the semifinals won't do much to alleviate concerns about this team, either. At the moment, it looks as if the whole is less than the sum of its parts under manager Didier Deschamps. 

But the sum of the parts is truly an embarrassment of riches. In the Nations League semifinal, France started a front four of Mbappé, Désiré Doué, Michael Olise, and Ousmane Dembélé. Yet France trailed 5-1 at one point in the second half. Les Bleus will enter next year's World Cup as one of the favorites because, despite their recent struggles, they have an overwhelming amount of talent at both scoring goals and defending. But finding the correct balance has been difficult for France since the end of the 2022 World Cup. They should have no issues qualifying in a UEFA group with Iceland, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan, and it would surprise no one to see them lift the trophy next summer. But there is plenty to watch for between now and next June. 

Star man: Lionel Messi (Inter Miami)

Fact to know: Emi Martinez has gone 4-0 with Argentina in penalty shoot-outs in the past three international tournaments 

The only other team that has a convincing case for the top spot in these rankings is Argentina, the defending world champions. Argentina didn't just win the 2022 World Cup final against France but bookended that historic triumph with Copa Ámerica titles in both 2021 and 2024. Argentina is currently 10 points clear of second place in the CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers, and they've beaten Brazil both home and away en route to a comfortable qualification. South America used to be Brazil, Argentina, and everyone else. Now, it's just Argentina and everyone else. 

The biggest question mark for Argentina between now and next summer is the state of Messi. He hasn't committed to playing yet (let's be honest—he'll be there), but what will his level of performance be if he does? Argentina is one of the better defensive teams in the world, with just nine goals conceded in 16 qualifying matches, but Messi was their most important player in the 2022 World Cup. They won without a ton of contributions from him at the 2024 Copa, but their creative output did suffer as a result. 

Star man: Lamine Yamal (Barcelona)

Fact to know: Spain has had seven penalty shoot-outs since the 2018 World Cup and lost four of them, including in Sunday's Nations League final against Portugal

Spain was inarguably the best team at the 2024 Euros, winning all seven matches and beating heavyweights like Germany, France, England, Italy, and Croatia. Spain also beat France in a 5-4 thriller in the recent Nations League semifinal, and while they ended up losing the final to Portugal in a penalty shoot-out, they remain the top team on this list. The arrow for Spain continues to point upward, boosted by its ever-reliable midfield and dynamic young wingers. Yamal has announced himself as legitimately one of the best players in the world—maybe even the best—at the ripe old age of 17. 

The emergence of new Real Madrid signing Dean Huijsen as a reliable center back could be key given the issues Spain has had with consistency at that position in the past few major tournaments. Mikel Oyarzabal isn't the most traditional striker option, but he's been a solid goal scorer and creator for Spain, notching three goals and two assists in the final four matches of the Nations League. The return of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri at the base of the midfield won't hurt, either. It's a loaded roster with depth and superstar talent that should enter as the favorite.

The idea that the United States men's national soccer team can simply roll out a third- or fourth-string lineup in this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup and still contend for the regional championship against the mostly full-strength likes of Canada or Mexico took a major hit on Tuesday, with Switzerland embarrassing a green American side 4-0 in its final pre-tournament friendly in Nashville, Tennessee.

U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino made nine lineup changes following Saturday's hard-fought 2-1 loss to another powerful European foe in Türkiye, and the Swiss carved through the hosts' defense with ease, scoring all four goals in a 23-minute stretch in the first half. Pochettino removed five of those starters at halftime, but their replacements could only stop the bleeding.

Just over a year out from the 2026 FIFA World Cup co-hosted bythe U.S., the national team is, for various reasons, without as many as 10 regulars this summer, including star forward Christian Pulisic, midfielder Weston McKennie, fullback Antonee Robinson, and strikers Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi. Pochettino also left several of those picked for Concacaf Nations League losses to Panama and Canada in March off this summer's squad. Their replacements didn't cover themselves in glory on Tuesday, displaying both unforced errors and the same worrying lack of urgency that plagued the varsity squad in March.

Here are a few quick thoughts on Tuesday's contest.

Nineteen-year-old Swiss winger Johan Manzambi added insult to injury when he fired the visitors fourth past a helpless Matt Turner in the 36th minute

Turner spilled a shot that allowed Monaco striker Breel Embolo to tap home the back-breaking third:

Tuesday's defeat was the Americans' fourth straight, its longest losing streak since 2007. That was part of a string of five consecutive defeats. Three of those came in Venezuela in the Copa América group stage, when the U.S. also used what amounted to a ""C"" team. The USMNT had lost four in a row at home only once before Tuesday, way back in 1988. 

The U.S. opens its Gold Cup group stage schedule on Sunday against Trinidad and Tobago in San Jose, California. Who will Poch choose to start against the Soca Warriors?

A number of players surely earned a spot on the bench for the Gold Cup following Tuesday's debacle. Others — Patrick Agyemang, Diego Luna, Malik Tillman — can probably expect to log big minutes over the next couple of weeks. They need to fight for their World Cup lives this summer. For others, it could already be too late.

A year and two days before its 2026 FIFA World Cup opener, the United States men's national team was booed off the field by its own fans in a half-empty stadium in Nashville. 

In a tune-up game for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup, which kicks off for the U.S. against Trinidad and Tobago on Sunday, the American dismantling at the hands of Switzerland was so comprehensive that the home team gave up more first-half goals (four) than it had in 40 years. Only Swiss disinterest in running the score up further in the second half seemed to spare the Americans—who registered zero shots on goal—from further humiliation than the 4-0 defeat. 

It was the fourth straight loss by the USMNT, its longest such streak since 2007, and a new nadir on the potholed road to the second World Cup to be played (mostly) on U.S. soil.

Power Ranking the 52 Teams Most Likely to Play in the 2026 World Cup

What Will the World Cup Stand For in an Isolationist America?

FIFA's Club World Cup Is an Audacious Bet on Limitless Growth—and Greed

Two weeks earlier, Mauricio Pochettino, U.S. Soccer's high-profile head coach hire last fall, had sounded the alarm when he announced his initial roster for the monthlong Gold Cup preparation camp. Near the end of a session with the American soccer press assembled on Zoom, Pochettino, unprompted, threw a verbal haymaker at his team's culture. 

“What we want to create in our national team is people desperate to come but desperate to come to perform,” he said. “We only have time to train one, two, three times, play [a game]. One, two recoveries [sessions], and play. And then go home and maybe wait two months to be all together [again]. If you want to arrive to the camp, and you want to spend a nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friends—and that is the culture we want to create? No, no, no, no, no. What we want to do is be focused and spend all my focus and energy on the national team. We need to create this culture about winning and to chase our aim. If we want to be good in one year's time [at the 2026 World Cup], we need to think that today is the most important day.”

On Sunday, Pochettino repeated this edict in Spanish and added a flourish. “I want 11 lions or wolves—or whatever animal you like best and is the most aggressive​​—on the field,” he said. “That they fight as if lives are on the line.”

The USMNT's last camp back in March, ahead of the finals of the CONCACAF Nations League, another regional trophy, had been a debacle. The Americans had won all three of the maiden editions of that tournament beginning in 2019 but lost to Panama in the semifinal and Canada in the third-place match this time around. They were both narrow losses, but the USMNT looked disheveled, no longer an effervescently gifted young team on the rise but rather a loose collection of unfamiliar players, adrift and disinterested. 

“For us, we learned a lot in the last few camps, for sure in March,” said Pochettino. “And I think it's about to be [a] different approach.”

He wasn't alone in voicing his concern. “When we come back, some things need to change and we need to improve,” captain Christian Pulisic had said in March. “Obviously, the feeling is not good right now. We need to turn it around and we can hopefully build some momentum this summer, because we really do need it.”

Whatever momentum and credibility a young and inexperienced team had assembled in a sound performance at the 2022 World Cup, reaching the round of 16, had been squandered. Plainly, ditching Gregg Berhalter after last summer's disappointing Copa América, ending his underwhelming second spell in charge, did little to lift the cloud over this team, or help it bust out of its slump. Nor had the switch to the most high-profile coach the USMNT has ever employed fixed any of the team's issues—at least not yet. The attacking shortcomings, the glaring lack of feistiness, the habit of playing down to weaker teams, they had all survived the coaching change—making the uncomfortable suggestion that perhaps the ousted head coach, who was popular with the players but not exactly with the fans, wasn't the problem. Worse still, the vibes on a team that once prided itself on its closeness were now very obviously rancid. 

“It's like a crossroads that we have now,” said defender Chris Richards. “After March, we really kind of had to look inside of ourselves and figure out what was the problem.”

“I don't think there's any denying that some of our performances have fallen short over the past year to 18 months,” echoed fellow defender Walker Zimmerman. “It's something that, us as players, we obviously aren't satisfied with, and it's a big focal point for this camp.”

Meanwhile, time marches inexorably on toward the 2026 World Cup, kicking off exactly a year from today, which will mostly be played on home soil. As several recent classes of American talent—unprecedented in their upside and pedigree—pushed into the first teams of some of Europe's most laureled clubs, they were inevitably affixed with the “golden generation” label. By 2026, it was projected, they would hit their primes and coalesce, all of it culminating in some kind of signature achievement. Because the thing about a golden moniker is that it implies winning something. Or at least doing something.

This expectation is hardly lost on this team. “Whenever you have an opportunity to play in a home World Cup, you want to put on a show, you want to put on your best performance,” said midfielder and occasional captain Tyler Adams. “It's growing in stature and growing in confidence of the young team that we have, understanding the responsibility that we have and what it's going to take. I think everyone is going to be prepared for that moment. There's not a ton of games left, obviously, before the World Cup.”

There aren't. After this Gold Cup, just four separate nine-day international windows remain before the USMNT has to be ready for the real thing. That's 36 days in total, most of which will, as Pochettino pointed out, be lost to jet lag and match prep and recovery.

Yet instead of ironing out the last kinks and buffing the final blemishes on his team, Pochettino has had to hit a kind of hard reset. Now in his fifth camp in charge, he has called in no fewer than 59 different players. This turnover has partly been foisted on him by the absence of 10 regulars this summer—for reasons ranging from obligations in the Club World Cup, to injuries, and, in the case of Pulisic, a need for rest—but it also gives the head coach a chance not only to try out fringe players and find depth pieces, but also to rewire the team's mindset. 

“Things happen in soccer,” said goalkeeper Matt Turner. “And I think what we need to control is what we bring to the table every single day: the intensity, the way we push each other, the passion, the energy, the connection with the fans, with each other, with the staff. We're going to be together for a long period of time and it's a really good opportunity for us to put a lot of things together, tactically, technically, emotionally.”

Pochettino, for his part, reported being pleased with the early mindset he had observed in the first week of camp. “This attitude I want to continue for the future until we are right to the World Cup,” he said. “That is the only way that we can improve. If I decide in September a different roster, what I want is the same level of commitment, attitude—not to complain about this and that, not excuses.”

The current, uncomplaining roster, missing all those regulars, faced a pair of strong but hardly unbeatable European(ish) teams in Türkiye and Switzerland in preparation for the Gold Cup. Certainly, the opposition in the run-up to the tournament would be stronger than it was likely to be in any game during the tournament itself, complicating the judgment of the performances. Still, the judgment, over the span of the two games, would be damning.

Against the Turks, the U.S. looked much more spirited than it had in March and scored a goal in the very first minute through a Jack McGlynn curler from outside the box. But a pair of defensive miscues in their own box midway through the first half consigned the Americans to a 2-1 loss, despite a series of second-half scoring chances on a soggy afternoon in East Hartford, Connecticut.

Even in defeat, it was enough to spark some optimism. “The team showed great energy, great mentality, great attitude,” Pochettino said after the match with Türkiye. “That is why I think I am so, so happy about the way that we delivered a show, in a way that we tried to play so positive. For sure, playing in this way, we are going to win most of the games. Today, OK, bad luck.”

But just three days later, whatever psychological building blocks had been put in place quickly disintegrated. Pochettino made a raft of changes, further diluting a team already missing so much of its first-choice talent, and Switzerland's dominance over a disjointed and utterly unthreatening American team was total. Radical optimism would be no salve this time around. 

“At halftime, we tried to change the system and to provide more calmness to the team,” Pochettino said after the game. “I think in the second half, the team matched Switzerland in all the areas, and that is the positive thing that we need to take from today.”

Pochettino's continued positivity following a pair of sound defeats says something about a bar that has been lowered far beyond what anyone might have imagined after Qatar. Presently, the team looks and sounds like one that's in rebuilding mode, taking satisfaction from flashes of promise, from spring's first green shoots. But actually, it's a team barreling toward a seminal event that might very well bend the arc of the sport in the country. If that sounds hyperbolic, the team's slogan for the second World Cup cycle under Berhalter was no less than to “change soccer in America forever.”

But after three years of never-before-seen highs from a team that really does have more technical talent than any previous incarnation, interspersed by are-we-really-still-doing-this lows, there is little choice but to peer at the near future through rose-tinted glasses. Because the pessimist's vantage point is bleak.

“Obviously, you wish that you would win every game in the lead-up to the World Cup and you're flying with confidence,” said Adams. “But it's a double-edged sword, so to speak, isn't it? You could be winning a bunch of games that don't really matter and get to the World Cup and not really have the performance that you want. Or you can go through a period of adaptation, like we're going through right now, and struggle a little bit and realize what's in front of you and realize how valuable playing in a home World Cup is going to be. To be honest, I think we're right where we're supposed to be right now. We've struggled, we've gotten beat down, we've been pegged back a stone. Now we need to continue to prove that we are at this level and able to improve. There's room for improvement to be sure but I'd rather that than be perfect.”

Certainly, there is no imminent prospect of perfection in this iteration of the U.S. men's national team. But a program that has been counting down to next summer ever since June 13, 2018, when North America was awarded the 2026 World Cup, needs to fashion something out of itself that is at least passable. And very soon.

Vinicius Jr scores as Brazil book World Cup spot

Brazil qualified for the 2026 World Cup with a 1-0 win against Paraguay in South American qualifying to give Carlo Ancelotti his first win as manager. 

Real Madrid forward Vinicius Jr scored from close range in the second half, finishing after fine work from Manchester United-bound playmaker Matheus Cunha.

The victory, Ancelotti's first after a 0-0 draw against Ecuador on his debut last week, means Brazil have now qualified for every edition of the World Cup.

""We needed to win and qualify for the World Cup,"" said Vinicius Jr.

""Now the coach will have more time to work. Of course today wasn't one of our best performances, but the important thing is always to win. 

""Now it's time to celebrate qualifying.""

Elsewhere, World Cup holders Argentina played out an entertaining 1-1 draw with Colombia in Buenos Aires.

Liverpool winger Luis Diaz opened the scoring with a fine individual goal, dancing through three defenders before finishing past Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.

Argentina were reduced to 10 men with 20 minutes remaining when Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez was sent off for a high-boot challenge on Colombia's Kevin Castano.

But Lionel Messi's side found an equaliser nine minutes from the end through Lyon's Thiago Almada, leaving Colombia four points clear of seventh-placed Venezuela. 

Ecuador, Argentina's nearest challengers, booked their spot at next summer's tournament in Canada, Mexico and the United States after a 0-0 draw away at Peru.

Brazil officially qualified for the 2026 FIFA World Cup with their 1–0 victory over Paraguay.

Five days after only managing a goalless draw with Ecuador, Brazil kicked off in São Paulo with their sights set on securing their first victory under new manager Carlo Ancelotti. The Seleção's attack received a major boost with the return of Raphinha, who recorded 56 goal contributions for Barcelona in 57 appearances this past season.

Brazil dominated the early stages of the match and looked better in 15 minutes than they had all game against La Tricolor last week. Raphinha and Vinícius Júnior got involved from the opening whistle, putting the pressure on Paraguay to desperately defend two of the best wingers in the world. 

Yet Ancelotti's attack was missing the end product in the final third to find the back of the net. Just when it looked like the hosts would head down the tunnel without getting on the scoresheet, Matheus Cunha played a lovely ball across the face of goal to find Vinícius Júnior, who poked home just his seventh career international goal.

Brazil did not let up in the second half. The team looked completely revitalized after only managing two shots on target in Ancelotti's debut on the touchline. Despite completely controlling the game and creating dangerous chances, though, the Seleção could not find a second goal on the night.

Still, Vinícius Júnior's goal was enough to send Brazil to the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Ancelotti's men are now third in the CONMBEOL standings with 25 points, securing their place in the United States, Canada and Mexico next summer. The Seleção remain the only nation qualify for every edition of the tournament.

Spurs are set to appoint the Brentford boss after deciding to sack Ange Postecoglou earlier this month

Tottenham's search for a successor to Ange Postecoglou has led them to Thomas Frank. The Dane is set to join from Brentford after an incredibly successful seven-year stint in west London, and has been tasked with a similar revolution on the northern edge of the city.

Frank was not only part of the Bees' revolution from mid-table Championship fodder to one of the Premier League's toughest outfits, but rather the catalyst. Brentford are forward thinking and innovators in their own right, but the crown jewel was their loveable, charismatic and tactically-astute head coach.

There are several reasons as to why Spurs were attracted to Frank, not least his philosophical flexibility and ability to operate on a budget, and now is the time to get behind their new manager. His spell at Brentford revolved around alignment on all fronts, and he's going to need similar support to bring further glory to Tottenham.

The German needs to find solutions - and fast - if England are to meet their supporters expectations and mount a serious challenge in North America

It's getting serious now. We're exactly one year away from the start of the 2026 World Cup and, for Thomas Tuchel, time is fast running out to construct an England squad that he feels is capable of flying out to North America and bringing the trophy home. By his own admission, and the length of his contract, that's the target, but judging by the last international camp of the 2024-25 season, the Three Lions are a million miles off being capable of navigating that final step and getting over the line at a major tournament.

If Andorra was bad, Senegal was worse. After delivering so many high points and memorable moments during the Gareth Southgate era, you could forgive England for a wobble in a World Cup qualifier that they ultimately won. What followed a few days later, though, and after a proper public dressing down from their manager too, was unacceptable. Friendly or not, Tuesday's disastrous showing at the City Ground shows just how much work needs to be done to put things right.

Hopefully the first defeat of the Tuchel era is the sobering wake-up call and reality check that the players need. Talked up, and rightly so, as one of the favourites to win the World Cup after reaching another Euros final, England have regressed, and significantly. Make no mistake about it, play anything like they have over the last two matches and the Three Lions will be lucky to make it through the group stages.

Roland Garros has just shut its doors for another year, but Wimbledon is right around the corner.

Carlos Alcaraz fought back to beat Jannik Sinner in the men's singles final at Roland Garros, despite his opponent having three championship points.

The Spaniard is also a two-time defending champion at Wimbledon, with Alcaraz beating Novak Djokovic in both the 2023 and 2024 finals.

Despite finishing as runner-up both of the last two years, Djokovic could still have a chance at Wimbledon. 

However, a current top 20 ATP player's chances at Wimbledon appear to be in doubt after he withdrew from an upcoming grass court tournament.

One of the most memorable matches at Roland Garros this year involved promising young Frenchman Arthur Fils, who won a four and a half hour match against Jaume Munar.

The French crowd were raucous on Court Suzanne-Lenglen as they cheered on the French number one, who appeared to be struggling physically after winning only two games in the third and fourth sets.

These concerns were then confirmed after Fils withdrew from his next match against Andrey Rublev due to a stress fracture in his back.

When Fils spoke to press after his withdrawal, he suggested that this was a recurring back problem and revealed that he could be out for four to six weeks.

With Wimbledon just under three weeks away, the world number 14 has now withdrawn from his upcoming grass court tournament in Halle.

Fils has now been replaced by Belgian Zizou Bergs, who will take his place for the ATP 500 tournament that is also set to feature Jannik Sinner, Alexander Zverev and Daniil Medvedev.

Halle update:OUT: FilsIN: BergsNext: Halys

When Fils revealed that his back injury is reoccurring, he was subsequently asked in his press conference whether it would require surgery.

In his response, the 20-year-old claimed that he did not think surgery would be required, but also could not confirm if he would be able to play Wimbledon and suggested that the hard court season was his priority. 

“I don't think I'm going to have to undergo surgery,” said Fils. “I don't think so. It's a good question, but I don't think so.

“As for the grass season, as I said earlier, I don't know yet. We'll see if I can be ready for Wimbledon. I'm not sure. We'll see. It's on hold for the moment.

“It will take time. I'm only 20 years old. I don't want to be in a hurry on the tour. I don't need to ramp up everything. I need to be ready for the hard court season, for the end of the year, and this is for the best.”

Fils achieved his best result at Wimbledon last year, reaching the fourth round before losing to Alex de Minaur.

He now faces a race against time to be fit for the grass court major that begins on Monday, June 30.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Six months into the 2025 ATP Tour season, the ATP has made significant progress in delivering greater ball consistency across the Tour. This is the first season in which the ATP is centralising the ball-supplier selection process, in collaboration with tournaments, moving away from the previous model where tournaments independently selected their own suppliers. 

This shift towards a more centralised approach is improving consistency in ball usage within tournament swings, resulting in fewer changes for players and greater week-to-week continuity. The aim is to enhance player preparation and performance. 

So far in 2025, swings that previously featured varying ball types – including the February European indoor, February/March outdoor in the Americas and Middle East, and European spring clay swings – have now aligned under the new system. Further alignment is planned for the second half of the season. As existing tournament contracts under the previous system expire, full alignment within swings is expected by the 2027 season.



As a next step, and in collaboration with industry experts, the ATP will continue refining the process through direct player feedback, ball quality data analysis, and stricter certification requirements.

Ross Hutchins, ATP Chief Sporting Officer, said: “Ball centralisation has long been a priority for our sport. This is the first year we've centrally managed the process, and the results are clear – greater consistency, fewer changes, and ultimately a more seamless experience for players week to week, with a better product for the fans. Still, we understand that consistency alone isn't enough. That's why we're actively reviewing specifications and certification standards with expert input – and with ongoing player feedback at the core. Since 2023, we've collected feedback from more than 3,500 player surveys at Tour level. This is a major focus for us, and we're grateful to our tournament partners and ball suppliers, whose collaboration has been key to driving our progress so far.”

 Will the 2025 BOSS OPEN prove to be a groundbreaking event for Ben Shelton? 

 The American on Wednesday made a confident start to his campaign at the grass-court ATP 250 with a 7-6(4), 7-5 win over the resilient Pierre-Hugues Herbert. Shelton crucially saved all four break points he faced in the second set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, before converting his first break point of the set in the 11th game to lead 6-5. The American then served out the match to set a quarter-final meeting with Jiri Lehecka. 

 “I'm really happy. Happy to get my first win here in Stuttgart,” said Shelton in his on-court interview. “I thought I played great in the big moments today down the stretch and I'm just really happy to be back on the grass competing. It's a completely different game, playing on this surface and hopefully I can get better and better as this week goes.”

 With his one-hour, 50-minute triumph, Shelton jumped two spots to No. 10 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. The 22-year-old lefty is guaranteed to break the Top 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time next Monday should he perform better in Stuttgart than Daniil Medvedev does at this week's Libema Open in ‘s-Hertogenbosch. His next opponent, eighth seed Lehecka, began his campaign with a 6-4, 7-5 triumph against home favourite Jan-Lennard Struff. 

 Shelton's countryman Taylor Fritz set up a hard-earned win with a fast start to book his quarter-final spot in Germany. The second seed notched the only break of his match against Quentin Halys before prevailing 6-3, 7-6(6). 

 “I think just coming out and first game, he served, and I played a really good game to get a break,” reflected Fritz. “Outside of that nothing really changed the rest of the match. He served really well, I served well, we both took good care of our serves. It was big for me to save two break points in the second [set]."" 



 With his win, Fritz improved to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Halys after he also beat the Frenchman on clay in Geneva last month. The World No. 7 is competing for the fourth time in Stuttgart, where he pushed Roger Federer to three sets on his event debut in 2016. 

 “Everyone keeps reminding me I played here in 2016. That was 10 years ago, so it keeps making me feel old,” joked the American. “Obviously it's been a long time, I've improved a lot. I still remember that match with Roger so perfectly, even though it was long ago. I'm happy to be back.” 

 Fritz will take on Marton Fucsovics also booked his last-eight spot on Wednesday in Germany. The Hungarian qualifier overcame Arthur Rinderknech 7-6(4), 6-3 to reach his fourth quarter-final in seven Stuttgart appearances.

Coming down from high of Sunday's French Open final  …

• Here's the 50 thoughts from the 2025 French Open (doing business as Roland Garros) column.

• Here's the latest Served podcast. Andy and I will be back to regular episodes and then we'll do our Wimbledon draw show in two weeks. In the meantime, another thanks—periodically offered; but always felt—for your listenership/viewership.

Onward …

Jon, what was your favorite part of Sunday's wild and wonderful men's final?

Angela, NYC

• Can I give you five?

1) Simply the level. Not only did it seldom drop, but often both players were at their peaks simultaneously—just a breathtaking display of tennis. Go back and watch that tiebreak—the last eight or so minutes of the match. Five hours in and there was no drop-off in play.

2) Carlos Alcaraz's mental recovery. He had already lost the first set in multiple matches. But to lose the first two? Against the No. 1 player? Numerous hours later he served for the title at 5–4. He played a loose game. Jannik Sinner recovered. And five minutes after standing on the threshold of victory, he was serving simply to stay in the match? Then Alcaraz won that game and (shoutout to Martina Navratilova for this observation in real time) he then felt unburdened and dominated the match tiebreak.

3) Sinner actually won more points—befitting a match this close—193 to 192.

4) Sinner did not double-fault. In fact, he doubled only twice the entire tournament! (A discussion point—and I will ask Darren Cahill this—does that mean Sinner is eerily accurate? Or that he perhaps should go for more on his serves?)

5) The absence of controversy. The cliché is that when officials go unrecognized, they have done the job well. But chapeau tip to Eva Asderaki, the chair umpire. The players not only didn't complain, but they both conceded points and spared her trips down from the chair. There were no dubious bathroom breaks. No dubious time violations. This was breathtaking tennis married with impeccable sportsmanship.

Excellent, as always, kind sir. 

On the topic of pet peeves, is it possible to resurrect the correct term “runner-up”? Sinner was the runner-up today. 

Both he and Alcaraz were the finalists. Then after an all-time classic, we had a winner and a runner-up.

• I'm down. And what do you say we put “lucky loser” out of its misery while we're here?

Hola Jon!!

Thank you for your wonderful French Open coverage.

2025: Novak Djokovic, 38 years old, getting to the FO semis (very expected). 1991: Jimmy Connors, 39 years old, getting to the US Open semis (a total surprise run)…both at almost the same age. In your opinion, what changed? Between these two eras.

Best regards.

Carlos Acosta

• Good week for Team Carlos A!

Great question. Connors made that run to the semifinals at 39 years old in 1991 and it's a national story, prompting anti-aging jokes etc. Djokovic makes a run to the semis in 2025 and we ask: Can he win Wimbledon? 

There's a book to be written or documentary to be made on this question. Staccato answers: Sports science. Sports technology. The infusion of wealth that enables players to hire teams and fly private. Schedule management. It stands to reason that each generation will play longer than the one before it, learning from their missteps, availing themselves of greater technology, etc. (Notice that Djokovic needed weeks, not months—never mind years—to return from knee surgery last summer.) 

But, also, let's not sell Djokovic short. His professionalism, commitment and will is perhaps singular.

Jon,  

Is it just me, or are tennis fans around the world disappointed at [Aryna] Sabalenka's remarks after losing to [Coco] Gauff at the French Open? To say that Coco lost because she made so many unforced errors and not because Coco played well, and to add insult to injury say that Coco would have lost to [Iga] Świątek had Świątek defeated Sabalenka in the semifinal match, notwithstanding the fact that Coco defeated Świątek 6–1, 6–1 in their last clay court match, was not only in poor taste, it says a lot about Sabalenka as a person.  I think Coco handled the remarks well in her response.  …These are my perceptions.

D.H., Tennessee

• Here's where I stand on Sabalenka:

A) She's great. A generational player. Generous of spirit. Her return from the yips to winning majors is one of the great sports accomplishments. She has gone from see-ball, hit-ball erratic to a reliable late-round habitue. Love the lack of inhibition. This was not her finest moment/day but cut her slack.

B) We—and I am as guilty as anyone here—want it both ways. If we like the unfiltered personality and the absence of talking points—and we do—we must consider that sometimes there's a flipside to brutal, unmediated candor.

C) When athletes speak or act immediately after competition, it calls for grace. They've been exposed. Their stress hormones are bubbling. Roger Federer crying on Rafael Nadal's shoulder. Players forget to thank spouses. Intemperate remarks. In 1995, Steffi Graf won the title, stood before the crowd, smiled … and then forgot her French and said, “Mon chapeau est bien.” (My hat is good.) We need to extend grace here.

When Sabalenka stood with the runner-up, er, finalist, trophy and declared her play “terrible,” it might not have been the epitome of grace. But she gets a pass. (And she did have all those errors. No one is arguing her level dropped in the final, though one would also think the opponent had a causal connection in that drop.)

D) Here's where she lost the room and plot. After a cooldown period—when she had time to gather her thoughts and emotions—she went to the press conference and doubled down, continuing not only to denigrate her performance and offer scant praise to the winner, and even take these potshots. “I think she won the match not because she played incredible, just because I made all of those mistakes.” 

Then there was this: “I mean, honestly, sometimes it felt like she was hitting the ball from the frame. Somehow, magically, the ball lands in the court, and you're kind of on the back foot. It felt like a joke, honestly, like somebody from above was just staying there laughing, like, ‘Let's see if you can handle this.'”

Calling an opponent “lucky” is weak. Especially when said opponent won 119 points. How many of those were frame jobs or lobs that, unexpectedly, landed in? Six, maybe? Then, weirdly, she volunteered that Iga Świątek would have beaten Gauff.

E) Never mind that fans were upset. The opponent was upset. Here was a crowning achievement of Gauff's career and she was visibly taken aback. Choosing her words cautiously, Gauff said: “I mean, I don't agree with that. I'm here sitting here [as the champion]. No shade to Iga or anything, but last time I played her I won in straight sets. I don't think that's a fair thing to say, because anything can really happen.”

F) Let Sabalenka live. None of us should be judged by our worst day. People tie themselves in knots; they can also untangle themselves. Her postmatch postmortem Saturday was unsporting and ungracious. She deserved to be called out. She was called out. She effectively apologized. Let's move on. One hopes she doesn't lose her cork-popping personality. And when she wins Wimbledon next month, we'll all look at this, chuckling, the way we looked at her tossing rackets in the dustbin in the 2023 U.S. Open cooldown room.

At the risk of being canceled … Sabalenka made 70 unforced errors—70!—in three sets and was still in a position to win. Dare I say if a male player made that many errors in three sets he would have been dusted in straight sets. Would love for you to prove me wrong with stats if you can. 

Thank you, 

Dominic C. NY

• No cancellation. But I don't know about that. First, there's something circular here. If you're dusted in a best-of-three match, you're not in a position to commit 70 errors. And if a male player faced a persistent, No. 2–ranked opponent … who played with a singular ability to prolong points … forcing the opponent to go for smaller margins … in a high-stakes match which amplified pressure … with lots of games going to deuce … with some ungenerous stats-keeping … strictly as a hypothetical, I can see it happening.

I was watching the French Open final today with [well-regarded former NBA player] and his family—good thing too because they never would have figured out the fifth set super tiebreaker. Not that anyone knew.

JB, PDX

• A) Anyone else notice the rapturous roar followed by whaaaa when Alcaraz won his seventh point. This is not a conventional tiebreaker. Gradually we'll get accustomed to that.

B) Kudos to the four majors. The uniform first-to-10 shootout in the decisive set is the way to go, a brilliant way to end a match. It's not a crapshoot and the sample size is up from best-of-seven. But it spares us the absurdity of winning by a two-game margin.

Hi Jon,

I have been a long-time reader of your excellent mailbag (since approximately 1998). I also listen to the Served podcast. I am a Canadian who emigrated from Russia back in 1995. I know that in both mailbag and podcast settings, you are now staying quite apolitical. However, your suggestion that USTA should pursue Victoria Mboko representing the US is remarkably tone-deaf, at least to your Canadian readers. Threats to Canadian sovereignty from your current leader have significantly altered the political landscape in Canada, resulting in one of the most remarkable turnarounds in political history. At some point, the ongoing political climate in the US is bound to catch up with what you and Andy are covering. 

Best regards, Vladimir Ivanov

• Point taken. I'd take that back if given a second serve. To be clear, I am anti-jingoist. The tennis world is flat. Players change countries. Federations subsidize players on the condition they switch nationality. Fans root for players, not the flags next to their names. This is to the benefit of the sport, though it erodes the meaning/esteem/value of Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup. 

My point: As long as we are now in a world where countries and federations pick off players and nationality are fungible, the USTA might as well get in the game. (Imagine a Billie Jean King Cup composed of all the players with a base in Florida and California.) 

But, taking a radical political stance, I'm documented Team Sovereignty. Hands Off Canada. Congrats on Mboko. She is a gem. 

Random mailbag Q, inspired by [Andre] Agassi and [Jim] Courier on the TNT desk and which you might be able to learn given your access: Do ex-players ever get on the court and compete in private, ala the end of ""Rocky 3"" when Rocky and Apollo get into a ring at an empty gym?

@nickcurious2

• If it ain't pickleball, Agassi isn't playing.

HAVE A GOOD WEEK, EVERYONE!

Coco Gauff is celebrating her 2025 French Open victory with a few surprise appearances around New York City.

Gauff received a standing ovation when she made a surprise appearance on a Tuesday night episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

Fallon celebrated by holding an audience vote on whether Gauff is ""one of the greatest athletes living today,"" which received a unanimous thumbs-up.

Gauff also made an appearance at a Tuesday night WNBA game between the Chicago Sky and New York Liberty, where she again received a standing ovation from the crowd at Barclays Center.

""That was insane,"" Gauff said about the ovation during a mid-game interview with ESPN. ""I wasn't expecting everyone to stand up. It just feels so cool to come back to such a warm reception.""

She was then filmed visiting the Liberty locker room after the home team celebrated Gauff's first WNBA game by claiming an 85-66 win over the Sky.

Gauff claimed her first Grand Slam in New York back in 2023, when she defeated Aryna Sabalenka in the final in Queens.

The 21-year-old took on Sabalenka again at Roland Garros, where she recovered from an early deficit to win 6-7(5), 6-2, 6-4 last Saturday in Paris.

Gauff is the first American woman to win the French open since Serena Williams in 2015, and the youngest woman to win multiple Grand Slam titles on different surfaces since Maria Sharapova in 2006.","{'href': 'https://bleacherreport.com', 'title': 'Bleacher Report'}","tennis"

Alexander Zverev has fired back at German tennis pundits Boris Becker and Barbara Rittner after criticism following his French Open exit.

World No 3 Zverev's hopes of a first Grand Slam title were dashed by Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals of Roland Garros, the Serbian defeating the German 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 last week.

It was the first time since 2020 that Zverev had failed to reach at least the semi-final of the event, and extended his wait for an elusive major.

The 28-year-old's career was put under the microscope on German TV following his defeat, with tennis icon Becker, a six-time Grand Slam winner, and Billie Jean King Cup captain Rittner among those sharing their thoughts.

Becker and Rittner were critical of Zverev's approach to the match, but a large focus was on the German's coaching situation.

Both former pros suggested that he needed to move away from his father, Alexander Sr, and brother Mischa.

“At some point you need new noises and a new environment. It's the same in football, as a football coach you don't normally stay with a club for 10 years,” commented Becker.

“He [Zverev] is the one who decides. He is the chairman of the board, the CEO. He decides what Team Zverev will look like in the future. His father and brother did an excellent job, but it wasn't good enough for the final step.”

Following a short break, the world No 3 returns to action at the Stuttgart Open this week, looking to ramp up his grass-court preparations ahead of Wimbledon.

And, asked about both Becker and Rittner's comments, the three-time major finalist was quick to counter their claims.

“When things are going well for me, I always do everything right,” said Zverev.

“When things are going badly for me, everyone else is very, very clever. Unfortunately, Boris is one of them, and so is Barbara Rittner.

“I don't know why she [Rittner] suddenly has so much to say about my tennis career. To be honest, I don't take her opinion seriously. Firstly, because of that, and secondly, because I think she's wrong.

“I lost to Djokovic. Maybe it wasn't my best match, but I thought he played very well – it was just difficult.

“And to be honest, I talked to Boris a lot, had a lot of contact with him before he made those statements. Before this crew had all that to say, I had a great relationship with him. I don't know why it all has to be like this now.”

Zverev was speaking ahead of his opening match in Stuttgart, with the German set to face mercurial Frenchman Corentin Moutet on Thursday.

And, despite disagreeing with Becker's comments, he insisted that he would always be willing to talk to the world No 1 to discuss their issues.

He added:  “I will always talk to him [Becker] if he wants to talk to me.

“In every relationship, whether it's with a partner or someone else, there are issues to argue about. This is perhaps one of ours at the moment.

“I still have enormous respect for him. He is an absolute legend, not only in sport, but in Germany in general, and also worldwide. I will always listen to what he has to say.

“But I don't always have to agree with him.”

Carlos Alcaraz's coach Juan Carlos Ferrero has spoken out after the five-time Grand Slam winner jetted off to Ibiza to celebrate his remarkable success at Roland Garros. The Spaniard came from behind to beat Jannik Sinner in the French Open final, playing out one of the most memorable matches in history.

The 22-year-old saved three championship points before going on to secure a 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2) win and retain his title. Following the triumph, it soon emerged that Alcaraz planned on celebrating in style.

He is set to enjoy a three-day trip in Ibiza before turning his attention to the grass season, having enjoyed a similar short break last year after winning his first French Open title.

Speaking about Alcaraz's plans, Ferrero revealed that he has spoken with the tennis superstar and reminded him about the upcoming schedule, telling El Laguero: “He's switching off. Yesterday I told him to have a good time because he deserved it, but to remember that he is a tennis player.

“We know how he is, these days suit him well, he'll come back refreshed and in a good mental state. It's not just about partying but about disconnecting, not thinking about tennis and being with his friends like any other 22-year-old kid.

""He does go on vacation, but only occasionally. He's not there every day, as people think. He'll return to work with motivation.”

Following Alcaraz's impressive win, Ferrero spoke about how he did not believe it was possible for the Spaniard to come from so far behind to land the title over the weekend. He explained: “In the third [set] also a break down after losing two sets, when you sit on the chair you start to think that maybe Jannik didn't lose a set and I'm two sets down, it's going to be very difficult to come back.

“But I think his strength is to keep believing all the time until the last ball is gone and he tries and tries. He was 0-40 in the fourth, 5-3 and he looked at me and he still makes like this with the racket, still saying we are still here, still saying vamos. I am not going to say I was believing that he was able to recover from this, 5-3, 0-40. But with Carlos everything is possible and he did it again. Amazing achievement.”

Aryna Sabalenka has been under fire for her remarks about Coco Gauff following her loss in the French Open final.

The 21-year-old American dazzled on Sunday, overcoming the world No. 1 with a score of 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 6-4 to secure her first-ever title at Roland Garros.

Sabalenka stirred controversy with her post-match comments, suggesting that if Iga Swiatek – whom she defeated in the semi-finals – had reached what would have been her fourth straight final in Paris, she would have beaten Gauff. Despite issuing an apology on social media, Sabalenka still faced criticism for her conduct.

Rennae Stubbs, the former coach of Serena Williams, was among the prominent voices disapproving of Sabalenka's actions, calling her press statements ""so bad"" and expressing disappointment even after the belated online apology. ""I love Sabalenka, but I don't know anymore,"" Stubbs said.

""Like, it took her 24 hours after that to write an apology, essentially, on Instagram. But I'm like, girlfriend. No. That was so bad, and there's no excuses for it. Like, there's just none. No, no, no. And that's coming from me who, as I said, I've said some stuff in press. Like, you never take it away from your opponent.""

After lifting the trophy, Gauff confidently responded to Sabalenka's earlier suggestion that Swiatek would have been a tougher final opponent, chuckling: ""I mean, I don't agree with that. I'm here sitting here.""

She reminded everyone of her recent triumph over Swiatek at the Madrid Open, stating: ""Last time I played – no shade to Iga or anything, but I played her and I won in straight sets. Yeah, I don't think that's a fair thing to say, because anything can really happen.

""Yeah, honestly the way Aryna was playing the last few weeks, she was the favourite to win. So I think she was the best person that I could have played in the final. Her being No. 1 in the world was the best person to play, so I think I got the hardest matchup just if you go off stats alone.""

Later, Gauff addressed Sabalenka's post-final remarks with grace, reports the Express. She gave her the benefit of the doubt due to the emotional nature of the day.

""I mean after that I was a little bit surprised about the comments and everything, but I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt,"" she said.

""I'm sure it was just an emotional day, an emotional match, and every time I play Aryna, she's a fighter. She's a tough opponent. I think we're like 6-5 in the head-to-head, so it's very close.""

However, not everyone was as sportsmanlike towards Sabalenka, with The Real Housewives of New York reality TV star Ubah Hassan delivering a scathing critique.

She left a biting comment on a video of Sabalenka's remarks: ""No mistake was made, darling your lip filler just got in the way of your vision.??????""

Roland Garros has just shut its doors for another year, but Wimbledon is right around the corner.

Carlos Alcaraz fought back to beat Jannik Sinner in the men's singles final at Roland Garros, despite his opponent having three championship points.

The Spaniard is also a two-time defending champion at Wimbledon, with Alcaraz beating Novak Djokovic in both the 2023 and 2024 finals.

Despite finishing as runner-up both of the last two years, Djokovic could still have a chance at Wimbledon. 

However, a current top 20 ATP player's chances at Wimbledon appear to be in doubt after he withdrew from an upcoming grass court tournament.

One of the most memorable matches at Roland Garros this year involved promising young Frenchman Arthur Fils, who won a four and a half hour match against Jaume Munar.

The French crowd were raucous on Court Suzanne-Lenglen as they cheered on the French number one, who appeared to be struggling physically after winning only two games in the third and fourth sets.

These concerns were then confirmed after Fils withdrew from his next match against Andrey Rublev due to a stress fracture in his back.

When Fils spoke to press after his withdrawal, he suggested that this was a recurring back problem and revealed that he could be out for four to six weeks.

With Wimbledon just under three weeks away, the world number 14 has now withdrawn from his upcoming grass court tournament in Halle.

Fils has now been replaced by Belgian Zizou Bergs, who will take his place for the ATP 500 tournament that is also set to feature Jannik Sinner, Alexander Zverev and Daniil Medvedev.

Halle update:OUT: FilsIN: BergsNext: Halys

When Fils revealed that his back injury is reoccurring, he was subsequently asked in his press conference whether it would require surgery.

In his response, the 20-year-old claimed that he did not think surgery would be required, but also could not confirm if he would be able to play Wimbledon and suggested that the hard court season was his priority. 

“I don't think I'm going to have to undergo surgery,” said Fils. “I don't think so. It's a good question, but I don't think so.

“As for the grass season, as I said earlier, I don't know yet. We'll see if I can be ready for Wimbledon. I'm not sure. We'll see. It's on hold for the moment.

“It will take time. I'm only 20 years old. I don't want to be in a hurry on the tour. I don't need to ramp up everything. I need to be ready for the hard court season, for the end of the year, and this is for the best.”

Fils achieved his best result at Wimbledon last year, reaching the fourth round before losing to Alex de Minaur.

He now faces a race against time to be fit for the grass court major that begins on Monday, June 30.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Awful Announcing

Outspoken Australian tennis star Nick Kyrgios, who has become a bit of a media darling on tennis majors in recent years, will not be returning to ESPN for this year's Wimbledon Championships.

According to a report by Ben Rumsby of The Telegraph, Kyrgios, who made his on-air debut at ESPN during the 2024 Australian Open, will not appear on ESPN's Wimbledon coverage this summer, despite featuring last year.

The so-called “bad boy” of tennis was hoping to play the tournament for the first time since 2022, when he lost in the men's singles final to Novak Djokovic. Unfortunately, the Australian has been hampered by injuries ever since, and he will not participate in this year's tournament as a player.

In addition to not appearing on ESPN's Wimbledon coverage in the United States, Kyrgios will also not appear on BBC's coverage of the event, as he had in the past. The British broadcaster had sparked controversy last year by hiring Kyrgios nearly a year after he admitted to assaulting an ex-girlfriend.

It's unclear whether Kyrgios' off-court situation has played a role in his absence from television coverage. His frank nature and analysis was generally well-received by viewers, though his behavior has long been a subject of controversy in the tennis world.

Last year, Kyrgios sharply criticized one of the world's top players, Jannik Sinner, when Sinner faced suspension after testing positive for a banned substance. However, the critique had a decidedly personal twist. Sinner had been dating Kyrgios' ex-girlfriend, Russian tennis player Anna Kalinskaya.

“I couldn't care less where sinner [sic] lays his wood. I'm in a happy relationship I just don't like people who are cheating the system,” the Australian posted to social media.

Sinner also happens to be coached by ESPN tennis analyst Darren Cahill, perhaps adding another reason to not bring Kyrgios back into the fold.

Drew Lerner is a staff writer for Awful Announcing and an aspiring cable subscriber. He previously covered sports media for Sports Media Watch. Future beat writer for the Oasis reunion tour.

Brian Rolapp is reportedly likely to take on the newly formed role.

Dive deep into the extraordinary career of tennis sensation Carlos Alcaraz.

At just 22, this Spanish prodigy has already etched out a legendary path. We take a look at his roots in Murcia, how many times he's lifted the Wimbledon trophy and his impressive Grand Slam haul.

Plus, his Olympic medal aspirations, his current relationship status, and the wins that pushed him to World No. 2. 

Tennis Head has everything you need to know about Alcaraz ahead of an exciting summer of tennis.

Carlos Alcaraz is 22 years old, having been born on May 5, 2003. He grew up in El Palmar, a suburb of Murcia, Spain. 

His father, a former tennis player and academy director, introduced him to the sport at a very young age at the Real Sociedad Club de Campo de Murcia. 

Alcaraz has a great Wimbledon record, especially considering his relatively short career so far, having won two Wimbledon singles titles. 

In 2023, he beat Novak Djokovic in a thrilling five-set final to claim his first Wimbledon crown. 

A year later he defended his title, again beating Novak Djokovic in the final, this time in straight sets. This means he has a 90% winning percentage at Wimbledon, which is exceptionally high. 

He has quickly established himself as one of the top grass-court players on the ATP Tour.

Carlos Alcaraz has stated that he is currently single. He has openly discussed the difficulties of maintaining a relationship due to his demanding travel schedule as a professional tennis player.

While he has been linked to other individuals in the past, such as Maria González Giménez and Emma Raducanu, he has not confirmed any relationships.

Carlos Alcaraz made his Olympic debut at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. He had a very successful first appearance in the Men's Singles event, reaching the final and securing a silver medal. 

His journey to the final included several remarkable victories before a hard-fought gold medal match against Novak Djokovic.

In Men's Doubles, Alcaraz teamed up with compatriot Rafael Nadal, forming a highly anticipated partnership. 

They demonstrated strong chemistry on the court and had a respectable run, reaching the quarter-finals before their elimination.

Australian Open: Quarter-finalist in both 2024 and 2025. He has not won the title yet, but he always reaches the latter stages.

French Open: Won in 2024 and defended his title in 2025. He also reached the semifinals in 2023 and the quarter-finals in 2022.

Wimbledon: Two-time champion, winning in both 2023 and 2024, defeating Novak Djokovic in both finals. 

US Open: Won his first Grand Slam title here in 2022. Reached the quarterfinals in 2021 and semifinals in 2023.

Carlos Alcaraz's ascent to World No. 2 has been fuelled by a series of victories at the sport's biggest events.

His breakthrough came with the 2022 US Open title, his first Grand Slam, which propelled him to World No. 1 as the youngest ever. 

That same year, winning ATP Masters 1000 titles in Miami and Madrid further cemented his rise.

In 2023, he claimed his second major at Wimbledon, defeating Novak Djokovic. He also secured another ATP Masters 1000 title in Indian Wells and successfully defended his Madrid Open crown.

The 2024 season saw him win the French Open and defend his Wimbledon title, consistently performing at the highest level. 

His strong start to 2025, including defending his French Open title and winning the Monte-Carlo Masters, continues to solidify his position at the top.

As of June 2025, Carlos Alcaraz's calculated net worth is between $40 million and $45 million. 

This valuation stems from his significant career earnings, totalling over $44 million in prize money from his five Grand Slam titles and numerous ATP Tour victories. 

Outside of playing tennis, Alcaraz also earns a lot of money from big deals with well-known brands.

He is a global ambassador for major brands like Nike (with a reported 10-year deal worth $15-20 million annually), Rolex, BMW, Calvin Klein, and Louis Vuitton.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

COCO GAUFF is quickly squeezing in the taste of glory while she still can.

The new French Open champ served up a treat for herself as she returned to the USA for brief downtime ahead of Wimbledon.

And what better way to unwind than taking in a game with your favorite children's snack?

The American looked happy to share her sweet secret court-side as she watched New York Liberty take on Chicago Sky in the WNBA at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.

Gauff, 21, even gave it pride of place - as she perched her packet of Sour Patch Kids candy on her lap in front of a shoulder bag.

The tennis star smiled to a camera as she gave a peace sign at the women's basketball match - or was it a hint about how many candies she had already consumed?

Cool Coco was chic but casual - wearing a blue bomber-style jacket, ripped back jeans and New Balance sneakers.

An infinity chain topped off her fashionable appearance.

Alongside Gauff were brother Cameron and businesswoman Vanessa Bryant, the widow of NBA legend Kobe Bryant.

Her carb-high snack might intrigue some observers in these days of rigorous diet and training programs for elite athletes.

Likewise, popping back from Europe to the US before Wimbledon might also be seen as unusual. 

But it all suggests Gauff enjoys a healthy balance between a supreme regime of fitness and occasionally letting her hair down.

And if anyone deserves a break, it's surely the first-time winner of the French Open.

Gauff was also presented with a ""25"" Liberty shirt by their 27-year-old icon Sabrina Ionescu after they sunk Chicago 85-66.

She now has two Slams to her name, having also won the 2023 US Open.

Now Gauff will be confident of producing her best-ever run at Wimbledon.

The World No. 2 has never bettered reaching the last 16.

But doing so three times already at her tender age - in 2019, 2021 and last year - indicates she can be a consistent title threat for a decade or more.

Meanwhile, Gauff was ""surprised"" to hear World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka say the duo played ""terrible tennis"" in the Roland Garros final.

The beaten Belarusian hit 70 unforced errors and called Saturday's windy conditions a ""joke"" as Gauff battled back to triumph 6-7 6-2 6-4.

However, tearful Sabalenka did add: “Coco congrats. 

""In these tough conditions, you were a better player than me. Well deserved. You are a fighter and a hard worker.""

Gauff responded by saying: ""I'm gonna give her the benefit of the doubt.

""I'm sure it was an emotional day, emotional match.""

And it should be easy for Gauff to deal with - as she loves things that are both sweet and sour!

The 2025 US Open will feature a new-look mixed doubles tournament, which could attract some of the biggest players in the men's and women's game.

It was announced earlier in the year that mixed doubles at the US Open would be completely rehauled ahead of the 2025 tournament.

The event will be played across two days on ‘fan week' with a unique rule set that may take some getting used to.

16 teams will compete in the tournament, eight of which will qualify through their combined singles rankings on the ATP and WTA Tours.

These changes have received mixed reviews, although it sounds like the player support is there, with many big names expected to sign up when tennis heads to New York in August.

One top WTA star has now responded when asked if she plans to play the event alongside her ATP Tour fiancée later this year.

During an interview ahead of the 2025 Queen's Club Championships, British number one Katie Boulter was asked whether she plans to play the US Open mixed doubles event with Alex de Minaur.

“You never know! I don't think we have ruled it out, but I don't think we have had a conversation about it. So something needs to change,” said Boulter.

“We do need to have a chat. I don't really know.”

The 28-year-old went on to explain that they don't need to make a decision right away.

“With this one, you can be quite spontaneous. It's a spur-of-the-moment thing,” she said.

“So, whereas all other tournaments, singles, doubles, you have a three-week entry deadline, and you have to do it before then. This one you can literally do the same week, sign in and hope for the best, so I do think it will be a very last-minute decision if we do play.”

De Minaur and Boulter have already played mixed doubles together, competing at the invitational Eisenhower Cup event at Indian Wells earlier this year.

Facing off against the American duo of Ben Shelton and Emma Navarro, Boulter and De Minaur fell short, losing 7-10.

Only time will tell if we will see Boulter and De Minaur return to the United States for some more mixed doubles action later in the year.

When the news broke that the mixed doubles event would undergo some pretty comprehensive changes, one of the discipline's most successful pairings spoke out.

Andrea Vavassori and Sara Errani, the defending US Open mixed doubles champions, expressed their disappointment in a social media post.

A post shared by Andrea Vavassori (@andrevavassori)

“In the last few weeks, we received the news that the US Open mixed doubles tournament will be completely turned upside down, cancelled, and replaced with a pseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show,” they said in a joint statement.

“A decision made without consulting anyone, which we can do nothing but accept. We see it as a profound injustice that disrespects an entire category of players. Putting money above tennis is never a good idea.

“We don't know at the moment if we'll have the chance to defend our title, but we hope this will remain an isolated case and this type of policy will not be considered again in the future. We strongly felt the need to share our thoughts, Sara & Andrea.”

Vavassori and Errani became the first-ever Italian mixed doubles champions at the US Open in 2024, when they beat the American duo of Taylor Townsend and Donald Young in the final.

Their thoughts aren't shared by everyone, however, as the outspoken Reilly Opelka gave his support to the US Open's decision, slamming the quality of doubles on social media.

“They should 100% get rid of dubs. It's for failed singles players,” he said.

Former world number one Andy Roddick was more cautious with his wording, but also expressed his support for the move.

“It's not as if I don't feel bad. Some of my best friends in the world [are doubles players],” said Roddick.

“But the arguments have to be based on fact or a new idea. You can't just use vague terms like we are not promoted. It's an old product that everyone knows about, which nobody watches. 

“I don't know if it will work, but it's something different to try opposed to just letting something bleed out.”

It remains to be seen whether the new US Open mixed doubles tournament will be a success or not, but it will certainly be worth tuning in for when the event begins on August 19, 2025.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Women's tennis players will now received protected rankings during periods where they undergo fertility treatment, according to a new announcement. 

The WTA, the sport's governing body broke new ground in March when they announced that they would be ensuring that their players would be eligible to receive maternity pay and 'comprehensive benefits' thanks to a new initiative between the organisation and their partner the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF). 

The controversial financial agreement with the Gulf state's sovereign wealth fund is just over a year old, and the initiative was the first of significance with the PIF as the tour's 'exclusive global partner'. 

An estimated 320 players on the women's tour became eligible for paid maternity leave of up to 12 months under the new regulations, as well as grants for fertility treatments, such as egg freezing, and additional benefits.

But the WTA have now extended their PIF WTA Maternity Fund Program to ensure that players undergoing egg or embryo freezing do not see their rankings under fire amid potentially seismic physical change. 

Former US Open champion Sloane Stephens shared her outspoken support of the programme as she opened up on her own experience of undergoing the challenges of playing through recovery. 

'The first time I did it, I rushed back and I was overweight and not happy - and just very stressed out,' Stephens told the BBC, sharing that she had undergone treatment twice during the off-season. 'The second time I did it I took a totally different approach so I could just be in better shape: I could have the surgery, I could have more time to recover.

'So having the protected ranking there, so that players don't feel forced to come back early and risk their health again, is the best thing possible.'

'It's all trial and error, everyone's body is different. Someone might be out for three months, someone might be out for one week.

'Some people gain a tonne of weight, some people can go back immediately. I think when you are family planning, it's better if you have that support.'

The protected ranking will be available to any of the top 750-ranked players, and allow them to compete in three tournaments with the special ranking within 10 weeks of returning to the tour. 

However, this will not extend to the tour's flagship tournaments, the Masters 1000s.  

WTA chief executive Portia Archer confirmed that the decision to enhance the existing program came at the request of the players in a statement shared by the WTA. 

Protected rankings are also available for players during pregnancy and postpartum for up to three years after giving birth. 

Although these protected rankings predate PIF's involvement with WTA, as independent contractors, female tennis stars have had few other financial protections when taking time out from the tour.

But the WTA's partnership with the PIF has not been without challenges, with players at the WTA Finals at the end of last year repeatedly asked to confront the seeming incompatibility of the deal due to Saudi's poor record on women's rights.

Eventual winner of the tournament Coco Gauff admitted that she had been 'concerned' when the location of the Finals had been announced, and that she had spent time talking to women in Saudi Arabia to discuss human rights issued ahead of participating.

With the Finals set to be staged in Riyadh for at least two more years, Gauff was also open that her participation would not be guaranteed if she qualified.

'If I felt uncomfortable or it felt like nothing's happening, then I probably wouldn't come back,' the former US Open champion added.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Fitch reveals leagues' new, anticipated borrowing","https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/06/11/fitch-reveals-leagues-new-anticipated-borrowing/","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 12:16:16 GMT","

Fitch Ratings issued a series of ratings actions on Tuesday evening that revealed details around new or anticipated borrowing by MLB, the NBA and the USTA's Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.

MLB has expanded the MLB Trust credit facility to allow for up to $2.5B in total commitments, increasing from $1.75B, and it has issued $6.25M in new borrowing for an undisclosed team. MLB has also extended the maturity dates on revolving credit facilities for both MLB Trust and the league's Facility Fund from July 2026 to July 2030.

The MLB Trust credit facility has total commitments of around $1.37B, while the $526M Facility Fund has $184M in current commitments. MLB's debt limit rules enable teams to borrow up to a maximum $125M from the MLB Trust credit facility and $100M from the facility fund. Fitch maintained the strong ratings and stable outlooks for MLB's borrowing that it issued last month, pointing to the league's history of valuable media rights agreements as well as new growth initiatives.

Fitch also revealed that on Monday the NBA's Hardwood Funding debt instrument sold seven series of notes totaling $1.384B in new debt. The league will use the funds to “refinance existing debt and for general corporate purposes,” per Fitch.

Fitch assigned an A- rating to the new debt and provided a stable outlook. While the NBA raised team debt limits in December, increasing the maximum borrowing from $275M to $425M per team, Fitch remains confident in the league's financial stability thanks largely to its 11-year, $77B media rights agreement, revenue from which is used to cover debt service payments before being distributed to teams.

The ratings agency indicated it currently rates $5.3B of total debt under Hardwood Funding, as well as a $2.5B revolving credit facility under the NBA's separate Basketball Funding vehicle.

And Fitch affirmed its A- rating on the USTA's Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, though it revised its outlook from positive to stable. The more neutral outlook reflects Fitch's anticipation that the USTA will take on “significant additional debt” to help fund an $800M renovation of the facility, the annual host of the US Open. 

While the USTA has not yet finalized its funding plans, Fitch anticipates new borrowing will increase the facility's leverage – a ratio of debt to pledged revenue streams – despite a 12-year renewal with ESPN that begins next year. USTA broadcast deals are responsible for nearly half of the revenue pledged to cover debt service, with most of the rest covered by US Open ticket sales.

Per Fitch, the USTA “has $291 million of unrestricted cash plus $180 million of liquid short-term investments on its balance sheet.”","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","tennis"

Roger Federer's Management Firm Faces Another Setback as Top Players Depart

In a shocking turn of events, Roger Federer's management firm, Team8 Management, has been hit with another high-profile departure. Ben Shelton, a rising tennis star, has announced his split from the Swiss icon's company, following in the footsteps of former client Coco Gauff. This double blow comes as a major setback for Federer and his long-time agent Tony Godsick, who co-own the management firm they founded back in 2013.

Shelton, who is gearing up for Wimbledon later this month, has made a surprising move by signing with talent agency WME (William Morris Endeavour), which also owns IMG (International Management Group). Joining the ranks of stellar tennis stars like Carlos Alcaraz, Serena Williams, and Iga Swiatek, Shelton is set to make waves in his new representation.

Meanwhile, Coco Gauff, fresh off her recent French Open victory, has taken a different path by establishing her own venture, Coco Gauff Enterprises, with the backing of WME. The 21-year-old phenom expressed her excitement about the new chapter in her career, emphasizing her passion for making a broad impact beyond just tennis.

Despite the departures of Shelton and Gauff, Federer's influence in the tennis world remains strong. The Swiss maestro's connection to Shelton through their shared sponsorship by Swiss apparel company On Running highlights the reach of Federer's brand even after his retirement from the sport nearly three years ago.

Former French Open champion Michael Chang praised Federer, along with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, for revolutionizing the culture of tennis. According to Chang, these tennis icons transformed the locker room environment, fostering a sense of camaraderie and respect among players regardless of their ranking or status in the game.

As Federer faces yet another setback in his management firm, the tennis world watches closely to see how the legendary player navigates these challenges and continues to inspire the next generation of tennis stars.

The new rule means players can now take time away from professional tennis for a fertility protection procedure such as egg or embryo freezing and safely return to competition with a protected ranking.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The WTA has introduced a new measure that provides ranking protection for WTA athletes who choose to undergo fertility protection. The development and adoption of the Fertility Protection Special Entry Ranking Rule has been championed by WTA players and delivers a further enhancement to the existing package of benefits empowering players to combine professional sport with family life.

The new rule means players can now take time away from professional tennis for a fertility protection procedure such as egg or embryo freezing and safely return to competition with a protected ranking. Eligible players will receive a Special Entry Ranking (SER), which can be used to enter up to three tournaments, based on the 12-week average of their WTA Ranking from eight weeks prior to the start of their out-of-competition period.

By introducing this new form of ranking protection, the WTA helps to support and empower women athletes to balance a professional sports career with planning and starting a family at a time of their choice.

The rule expands the WTA's comprehensive Family Focus Program, which includes ranking protection during pregnancy, or another means of parenthood, and postpartum support with a return to play. WTA athletes now also benefit from paid maternity leave and grants for fertility protection through the PIF WTA Maternity Fund. In addition, the WTA offers support for players' physical and emotional wellbeing via a team of dedicated health and wellness professionals.

Sloane Stephens, the winner of eight WTA singles titles, commented: “I'm incredibly proud of our sport in recognizing the importance of fertility treatments for female athletes. For any woman, the conversation of family life versus a career is nuanced and complex. The WTA has now created a safe space for players to explore options and to make the best decisions for themselves. It's truly ground-breaking and will empower this generation, and future generations of players, to continue with the sport they love without having to compromise.”

Portia Archer, WTA CEO, said: “We understand that professional athletes can face a dilemma between focusing on their career and starting a family, and we are committed to supporting WTA players as they navigate and balance the choices associated with career and family. After hearing from players that the option of fertility protection offers a proactive way to balance family goals and career ambitions, we're delighted that this new measure, alongside the fertility grant offered by the PIF WTA Maternity Fund, will contribute to enabling our athletes to realize their full potential and become parents at a time of their choice.”

 

 

The new rule means players can now take time away from professional tennis for a fertility protection procedure such as egg or embryo freezing and safely return to competition with a protected ranking.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery are racing to offload their ailing linear TV channels. But just one of the new SpinCos is unburdened by billions in debt.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	The creation of Warner Bros. Discovery began with the corporate equivalent of sunshine and rainbows. In February 2021, David Zaslav, then the CEO of Discovery Inc., sent AT&T CEO John Stankey an amiable text. The message, which was adorned with both a golf and sunglasses emoji, sparked a series of talks (including secret meetings in a lower Manhattan townhouse) that led to the creation of WBD in 2022.


	Just three years later, the sunshine and golf has been replaced by cloudy skies, as the company prepares to split itself up. One current employee who works in what will become Gunnar Wiedenfels' global networks company expressed frustration at the news, lamenting that by the time this deal closes next year, the company will have spent an entire decade shuffling ownership from one entity to the next, from AT&T's deal for Time Warner, to the Discovery deal, to now — all while the stock price and cash flow have steadily declined as the cable iceberg melts, and with layoffs and cuts never ending but executive pay rising.

	Superficially, at least, WBD's maneuver bears a striking resemblance to Comcast's decision to spin off its cable TV channels into Versant, but it is in the details where the two plans diverge. The biggest difference may be reflected in the very first question that Wall Street analysts asked Zaslav on a conference call on the morning of June 9: the debt.




			Related Video		







	Wiedenfels' global networks company will hold a “majority” of WBD's more than $30 billion in debt, utilizing its cash-flow-rich but slowly melting assets to service that debt. Versant, by contrast, is expected to have minimal debt, so that it can be an opportunistic acquirer (Versant CEO Mark Lazarus has told fellow media execs that he wants his company to be aggressive and expects to be a buyer rather than a seller). 

	











	“If you have a portfolio of what's called linear channels, one of the things you're thinking about is, ‘Do they have successors in the streaming world?' And if so, how do I get from here to there?” says Integrated Media CEO Jon Miller, who adds that a high debt load could also make the company less attractive as an acquisition target. “Not every linear channel is going to make it to the streaming world and thrive in the streaming world. So you're going to have to determine what you believe can thrive in the streaming world and make some choices and investments. If you have a lot of debt on top of that, your ability to invest is more limited. And so by necessity, you have to make even fewer choices in terms of what you invest in going forward.”


	At Zaslav's studios and HBO business, meanwhile, a solid balance sheet and creative portfolio are offset by losing the cash flow from cable TV. While NBCUniversal holds on to cash-flow-rich businesses like NBC and the Universal theme parks in its spinout, WBD is essentially divesting itself of its cash-flow machine in the name of creating a growth business.


	Comcast noted that Versant will have about $7 billion in cash flow, while what remains of NBCU will have nearly $40 billion in revenue. While WBD has not yet broken down its financials post-transaction, the linear networks comprise a majority of its revenue, giving it a very different economic profile.


	Zaslav's business, however, could make for a ripe acquisition target, as Wolfe Research's Peter Supino notes. As for Wiedenfels' side of things, “Global Networks will not be positioned to die, in our view, but will still shrink materially,” Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin dryly wrote June 9. “Some attractive assets, such as U.S. sports rights, the CNN and Discovery streaming properties, and digital assets like Bleacher Report, can mitigate the linear television networks' decline.”

	











	And while Versant has a tight bundle of seven cable TV channels and some digital brands like Fandango, the new WBD networks business will have a larger collection of channels, perhaps giving it more runway to operate but also giving it less ability to focus. And while NBCU spent years trimming down its roster of cable channels to only those it thought mattered, WBD has tried to prop up its channels in the service of survival, with a pivot at TruTV into a sports channel just the latest example. 


	“NBC, they've been really good and active the past couple of years skinny-ing down their program offerings so we don't have to re-up with networks that are of low value,” says Keith Bowen, president of news, programming and business services for the cable company Optimum. 


	And Lazarus, at Versant, has made it a priority to get employees hyped up about being at what he frames as a well-capitalized startup rather than a holding company for a dying industry. In addition to acquiring companies, Lazarus has talked openly about acquiring new sports rights, about building out a programming team to develop and acquire entertainment, about staffing up in news at MSNBC and CNBC, and about a new temporary midtown Manhattan headquarters (located in the building that used to be the home of The New York Times) that he is dubbing “summer camp.”


	While the messaging may change, WBD's initial public pitch remained focused on efficiency, rather than opportunity.


	But there is opportunity in that efficiency, as Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote shortly after the split was announced.

	











	“With Streaming & Studios separated as a standalone public company unburdened by the substantial debt burden, we expect significant investor interest (both public and private) in these highly valuable assets,” she wrote. “Similarly, as a standalone entity, Global Networks has optionality including asset sales or the potential to become a ‘roll up' for other similar assets, likely at attractive valuations and subsequently extract several cost synergies (corporate, advertising sales, etc.) to extend the runway of FCF these assets would yield to service debt over the next several years.”


	One company that will excite investors, and another that will extract cost synergies to service debt, with any deal a ways away. “While we view the split of Networks and Streaming & Studios as just the first step to unlock value, a second step may require patience,” Supino writes.


	The two SpinCos also tell a tale about the future. The first media mogul to broach the idea of spinning off their linear channels was Disney CEO Bob Iger, shortly after rejoining the company in 2022. Disney ultimately opted not to do so, but one wonders whether the company reconsiders in light of what rivals are pursuing. Similar questions are sure to arise as Paramount Global sits in limbo waiting for the Skydance deal to  close.


	The past 30 years of the entertainment business were funded by cable TV cash, but it seems that era is finally coming to an end. The tastemakers gave way to the number crunchers, and now the number crunchers are sending the TV channels off to the vultures.

	











	Or, as mogul and dealmaker Barry Diller told THR in a May interview: “We've gone from a town to a spreadsheet.” The propagators of those spreadsheets are running the show, and have decided that ripping up the businesses they helped forge is the pathway to success.

In a career that lasted more than 60 years, he appeared in films with Burt Lancaster and Ted Cassidy. And in a commercial for cough syrup, he noted he wasn't a doctor but played one on TV.


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	Chris Robinson, who starred as a World War II bomber pilot on the 1960s ABC drama 12 O'Clock High and had lengthy stints on the daytime soap operas General Hospital and The Bold and the Beautiful, has died. He was 86.


	Robinson died Monday on his ranch near Sedona, Arizona, actor and musician MJ Allen announced on Facebook. They worked together on the 2022 film Just for a Week.




	During an acting career that spanned eight decades, Robinson worked alongside Burt Lancaster in The Young Savages (1961) and Birdman of Alcatraz (1962), both directed by John Frankenheimer, and with Addams Family icon Ted Cassidy in four films, all of which he directed.

	The Florida native also starred as Vietnam vet Tim Ochopee, a Seminole with a pet rattlesnake who obeys his commands (for most of the movie, anyway), in the Everglades-set horror film Stanley (1972), from Crown International Pictures.


	Robinson joined the cast of the Quinn Martin-produced 12 O'Clock High as Technical Sgt. Sandy Komansky for its second season in September 1965. (Also coming on board as a full-time castmember that year: Paul Burke as Col. Joe Gallagher.) He appeared on the final 46 episodes of the show through January 1967.


	On ABC's General Hospital, he portrayed Dr. Rick Webber (two-time husband of Denise Alexander‘s Lesley and adoptive father of Genie Francis' Laura) from 1978-86. He came back in 2002, only to have his character bludgeoned to death with a candlestick by Scotty Baldwin (Kin Shriner), Laura's former husband.


	Robinson also played Jack Hamilton, who enjoyed romances with Stephanie Douglas (Susan Flannery) and her rival Sally Spectra (Darlene Conley), on CBS' The Bold and the Beautiful from 1992-2002, with a final appearance in 2005.


	While he was working on G.H. — and after showing up in Garry Marshall's soapy Young Doctors in Love (1982) — Robinson established his bona fides as a pitchman in a Vicks Formula 44 cough syrup commercial. “I'm not a doctor,” he noted, “but I do play one on TV.”

	











	But when he encountered legal trouble related to income tax evasion, he was replaced by Peter Bergman, another TV doctor on another soap (All My Children).


	Born on Nov. 5, 1938, in West Palm Beach, Florida, Christopher Brown Robinson appeared uncredited in the Tony Curtis-starring The Midnight Story (1957). Two years later, he played a teenage thug in The Diary of a High School Bride and the spider-like monster in Gene Corman's Beast From Haunted Cave, wearing a costume he had designed.


	Robinson stayed busy after that, guest-starring on such series as Colt. 45, Hennesey, The Donna Reed Show, Sea Hunt, Death Valley Days, Ben Casey, Gunsmoke, Wagon Train and The Fugitive before landing on 12 O'Clock High.


	He starred as an albino slave who is on the run with his brother (Anthony Scott) from a plantation owner (Cassidy) in Catch the Black Sunshine (1974), which he also wrote and directed, then did similar triple duty on Thunder County (1974), The Intruder (1975) and The Great Balloon Race (1977).


	Talking about The Intruder — which also featured Mickey Rooney and Yvonne De Carlo — in a 2017 interview with Nick Thomas, Robinson said he cast it, put the crew together and shot it in a mere six weeks.


	Asked what became of the movie, Robinson replied: “I have no idea. I wasn't involved in the editing and didn't even see the finished film, which was never released. I moved on to other projects and just forgot about it.”

	











	Robinson's big-screen résumé also included Because They're Young (1960), The Long Rope (1961), Shootout at Big Sag (1962), Lady in Cement (1968), The Cycle Savages (1969), The Hawaiians (1970), Revenge Is My Destiny (1971), Amy (1981), Savannah Smiles (1982) and Just for a Week (2022).


	Click here for a video tribute to his career.


	In 1985, Robinson pleaded guilty to federal income tax evasion but was allowed to continue on G.H. by serving his sentence on nights and weekends. In between that soap and The Bold and the Beautiful, he portrayed Jason Frame on NBC's Another World from 1987-89.


	He married his fourth wife, Jacquie, in April 2011. Survivors also include his children, Shane, Coby, Christian, Christopher, Chris and Taylor, and grandchildren Ivy, Ava, Davey, Brooks and Knox.


	His son Chris opened a window into the family by producing and directing two documentary shorts: Bankrupt by Beanies (2009), about his dad buying many thousands of Beanie Baby plush toys with the goal of reselling them at a profit, and Bastard: An Illegitimate Film (2010), which explored his “complicated” family tree (his father had his nine kids with six women).


	Chris revealed in Bastard that he was “conceived in [his dad's] dressing room in General Hospital” and pointed out that his father “practically had as many relationships in his real life as he's had in the movies.”


	“No matter how we came to be, all of us are connected,” Chris, talking about his siblings and half-siblings, said in closing the documentary. “And when our father is gone, even as some of us don't even consider him to be their father, we'll still have each other to look to for love and support. It might not be normal, but it's certainly a hell of a lot more interesting.”

The former CBS News president and Almar Latour spoke at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit in London about the topic of ""Media, Machines, and Mayhem: Truth as a Competitive Advantage."" 


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Media companies have made major mistakes in reacting to technological change in the past that must be avoided amid the rise of artificial intelligence. That was the message shared by David Rhodes, executive chairman of Sky News and the former CBS News president, and Almar Latour, CEO of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, both part of News Corp, during an appearance at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit in London on Wednesday.


	They spoke in a session, which was live-streamed and entitled “Media, Machines, and Mayhem: Truth as a Competitive Advantage.”

	“There is a failure of imagination” when it comes to a vision for AI, Rhodes argued. “Right now, we talk about generative AI and talk about answers to prompts, and we think only about text. But what's really important to us is to be a design partner with all of the firms … on what it looks like when something much more compelling happens, which is when these models come for video. We do want that design partnership.” 


	Of course, the appropriate business and financial models for AI companies to use media content remains a key focus and issue of debate. Various media companies have struck licensing deals with one AI company while suing another. “We also want to advocate for good terms of trade, for how our information, how our results turn up in answers to those prompts,” Rhodes highlighted in that context. “We need to not repeat what were the errors of the news media in approaching Web 1.0 and even Web 2.0 and social media, where big mistakes were made.”

	











	Latour echoed that when sharing his company's approach to AI. Dow Jones has struck a licensing deal with OpenAI, but it sued Perplexity AI.


	“We want a commercial arrangement with all the AI platforms. That's the foundation of it. Information has value, and we need to, through a market mechanism, arrive at that value,” he emphasized. Highlighting that Dow Jones spends $1.7 billion every year “to perform the little miracle that is the Wall Street Journal and all of our other information,” he highlighted that nobody can expect to “take all of your productivity from this year… give it away for free, move it into the AI machine,” and take 130 years worth of archives without appropriate pay. “We're not going to let that happen. We need fair value for that, or otherwise, there's not going to be any news,” the CEO concluded.


	He didn't mince words in his follow-up comments. “So we want to strike commercial arrangements. If you do not agree to that, you are a thug, and we'll come after you like a common thief,” Latour shared. “We will see you in court, and we will argue our case. And that may sound belligerent, but it is a necessity.”


	Rhodes on Wednesday didn't comment on the litigation brought by U.S. President Donald Trump against CBS News over how 60 Minutes edited his former opponent Kamala Harris' answer to a question. The two sides have been in mediation talks to try and resolve the suit, with Paramount reportedly to have offered $15 million to resolve the suit. The Federal Communications Commission is also reviewing the interview via its “news distortion” purview while also reviewing CBS parent Paramount Global's deal to sell to Skydance Media. 

	











	So, is there press freedom in the United States right now? “Yes, there is press freedom,” replied Latour. “I get asked this question all the time, particularly when I'm traveling abroad. Our journalists can freely report, and our opinion writers are free to share their free markets, free people philosophy richly.”


	He continued: “There is a free debate. The President, of course, and the administration is free to respond to that, and the decibel level has gone up. But I think there should not be hysteria.” Concluded Latour: “The tension between an administration and established media, or other media, is common. We got clobbered when the Wall Street Journal did a front-page story on President Biden's cognitive decline, and that was not very comfortable. The decibel level has definitely gone up.”


	That conclusion wrapped up the session. “In a world where seemingly every voice has a platform, where narratives can make or break a business, and where public trust in corporations and institutions has rapidly eroded, the mission of global news organizations has never been more vital – or more complex,” its description said.

The actress, who played Black Widow in the MCU for 11 years, recently chatted with her 'Black Widow' co-star David Harbour.

Scarlett Johansson is opening up about the challenges of filming a Marvel film with a large ensemble.


	The actress who played Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe for 11 years recently chatted with David Harbour, her co-star in 2021's Black Widow, for Interview magazine about the difficulty of playing the same character for so many years.




	“Some of the films that I did for Marvel engaged my character more than others,” Johansson admitted. “Like in Captain America: The Winter Soldier with Chris [Evans], we were really dynamic. In some of the other films, the cast was so enormous and there was so much plot to serve that you start to feel like you're a device to move it along. And if you're committed to five and a half months of that, it's like, ‘Okay. I can't paint my nails, I can't get a haircut.' These sound like silly problems, but your identity is wrapped up in this job for a long time, and if you're not doing engaging work as an actor, you feel a little cagey sometimes.”

	Harbour played Alexei in 2021's Black Widow, which served as a prequel, as Johansson's character was killed off in 2019's Avengers: Endgame. However, the Thunderbolts* star understood Johansson's perspective, as he's played Hopper in Netflix's Stranger Things for nearly 10 years, with the fifth and final season releasing later this year.


	“When I started, I loved it so much,” he explained. “Buddies of mine who'd done TV shows for many years said, ‘By season three or four you'll be running.' And I was like, ‘Never! I love all these guys so much.' And then you get to a certain point where you're like, ‘How much more story is there?' You're having to play a lot of the same beat, and there's a feeling where you're like, ‘I want to take a risk. I want to do something that people haven't seen me do before.' So yeah, after 10 years, it's like, ‘Okay.'”

	











	Elsewhere during their conversation, Harbour also mentioned that Johansson was listed as an executive producer on his latest film, Thunderbolts*, at one point. “It's the opening day of a movie that basically you are the seventh Thunderbolt in. Your character is all over this movie…. You are an executive producer on it. Congratulations,” he said.


	Johansson proceeded to clarify that she “asked to have my credit removed because I wasn't involved,” signaling that she was likely credited on the film due to contractual reasons.


	Harbour's Alexei and Florence Pugh's Yelena made their MCU debut in Black Widow before they went on to lead Thunderbolts*. The film also starred Sebastian Stan, Julia Louis Dreyfus, Lewis Pullman, Wyatt Russell, Hannah John-Kamen, Olga Kurylenko and Geraldine Viswanathan.

""Piracy is piracy,"" says Disney's chief legal officer, as the studios aim to show that tools allowing personalized AI slop creations of characters like Darth Vader or Shrek run afoul of their IP. 


							By 

	Erik Hayden


Executive Editor, Business


	In the next chapter of Big Entertainment vs. Big Tech, Disney and Universal have filed a lawsuit against artificial intelligence company Midjourney over tools that allow users to create images and videos that can manipulate famous characters at the click of a prompt.


	The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday by Disney Enterprises, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century, Universal City Studios Productions and DreamWorks Animation, describes the David Holz-run generative AI firm Midjourney as a “bottomless pit of plagiarism.”

	The legal salvo marks the first major foray from Hollywood against tech giants that are hoping to reorient consumer habits with personalized entertainment and information by vacuuming up data on the internet and spitting it out in the form of chatbot copy or images. So far, Wall Street has bet big that AI will be a major economic driver in the future and AI companies have raised tens of billions of dollars to realize that vision.


	Notably, major film and TV studios have not yet inked significant deals with AI companies to license their IP to these tech giants' tools that are now used by millions of users. That marks a different tack from major media companies, which have largely decided to take checks to license content to companies like OpenAI versus spend millions fighting in court. (The New York Times is an exception, and it has spent $10 million-plus fighting OpenAI so far.) 


	The complaint from Disney and Universal details how Midjourney's tools easily allow users to create image-based works based on the intellectual property of Disney and Universal — think: Darth Vader or Shrek at the beach, etc. This is commonly called “AI Slop,” and many likely already see it in their social media feeds. 

	











	“If a Midjourney subscriber submits a simple text prompt requesting an image of the character Darth Vader in a particular setting or doing a particular action, Midjourney obliges by generating and displaying a high quality, downloadable image featuring Disney's copyrighted Darth Vader character,” the complaint reads. 


	The complaint offers AI-generated images of Vader, Wall-E, Stormtroopers, How to Train Your Dragon characters, Minions and Shrek and many more as evidence of copyright infringement perpetuated by Midjourney. And it singles out Star Wars character Yoda with a side-by-side comparison: 


	The Hollywood studios go on to allege that Midjourney is able to provide such outputs because its tools have already ingested copyrighted intellectual property across the web as training data. “Midjourney downloaded from the internet, and other sources, content using tools variously described as bots, scrapers, streamrippers, video downloaders, and web crawlers,” the complaint says, alleging that the AI company's CEO David Holz “admitted that to collect the training data, Midjourney ‘pulls off all the data it can, all the text it can, all the images it can.'”


	The studios also claim that Midjourney then “cleaned” and converted digital files of copyrighted intellectual property to use in its training data so that its tools could then provide outputs allowing users to create things like personalized Yoda, Vader or Shrek images. “When a subscriber enters a prompt for an image of Spider-Man, Minions, Iron Man, or any of Plaintiffs' countless copyrighted characters, Midjourney creates yet another copy of that character which it publicly displays and/or distributes via download,” the complaint reads. 

	











	The lawsuit highlights that not only does Midjourney allow the creation of these works based on Disney and Universal's copyrighted characters, the AI company goes further by having them displayed in its “Explore” section of its website — a sign that, the studios say, Midjourney is fully aware of what its product does and is capitalizing on the plagiarism. 


	“Midjourney's publication and curation of infringing images on the Explore page show that Midjourney knows that its platform regularly reproduces Plaintiffs' Copyrighted Works, and that the Explore page is intended to advertise Midjourney's ability to infringe the Copyrighted Works,” the complaint reads.


	And the complaint goes on to alleged that Midjourney has the tools in place to prevent outputs that run afoul of copyrighted intellectual property, but it choose to not enact them. “Midjourney controls, and has the ability to control, generative outputs through readily available technical protection measures,” the studios argue. “Despite having the ability to do so, Midjourney has affirmatively chosen not to use copyright protection measures to limit the infringement.”


	The top legal officer of Disney put it more simply in a strongly-worded statement accompanying the lawsuit: “Piracy is piracy.” Using that phrasing frames the fight against Midjourney in familiar language to the studios' lobbying group, the Motion Picture Association, which also talks up its fight against piracy. But the MPA, so far, has mostly gone after websites that show unauthorized movies and TV shows, not AI companies, despite the prevalence of users flocking to AI-powered tools. 

	











	“Our world-class IP is built on decades of financial investment, creativity and innovation—investments only made possible by the incentives embodied in copyright law that give creators the exclusive right to profit from their works,” stated Disney general counsel Horacio Gutierrez. “We are bullish on the promise of AI technology and optimistic about how it can be used responsibly as a tool to further human creativity. But piracy is piracy, and the fact that it's done by an AI company does not make it any less infringing.” 


	The full complaint is below:

The news comes on the heels of the project's lead single, ""Manchild.""


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Sabrina Carpenter‘s break between her last album and next LP was short and sweet, with the pop star announcing Wednesday (June 11) that she has another full-length titled Man's Best Friend coming out this summer.


	Sharing the news on Instagram, Carpenter unveiled the project's sensual cover art — a photo of the Grammy winner down on her knees in black stilettos, held in place by a man gripping a fistful of her hair — and revealed that it will arrive Aug. 29. “i can't wait for it to be yours x,” she added in her caption.

	











	According to its Spotify countdown page, Man's Best Friend will feature 12 tracks, including lead single “Manchild,” which recently dropped and is gunning for a high debut on the Billboard Hot 100. The country-tinged track — co-written and produced alongside Carpenter's Short n' Sweet collaborators Jack Antonoff and Amy Allen — finds the Girl Meets World alum playfully calling out incompetent men.

	“Manchild, why you always come a-running to me?/ F–k my life, won't you let an innocent woman be?” she sings on the song. “Never heard of self-care/ Half your brain just ain't there.”


Man's Best Friend comes close on the heels of Carpenter's breakthrough album Short n' Sweet, which dropped last August and propelled the singer to superstar status through Billboard Hot 100 top 10 singles “Espresso” and “Taste.” The LP marked her first-ever No. 1 entry on the Billboard 200, where it reigned at the top for four weeks, and spawned her first Hot 100 No. 1, “Please Please Please.”

	YEONCHEON, South Korea — Jimin and Jung Kook of BTS were officially discharged from South Korea's mandatory military service on Wednesday (June 11), marking a major step forward in the group's long-awaited reunion.


	With their discharge, six of the seven BTS members have now completed their service obligations, with only SUGA currently fulfilling his alternative service as a social worker. His discharge is expected later this month.

	











	On Tuesday morning, fans and media began gathering near Yeoncheon Public Stadium in Gyeonggi Province to welcome the two stars. Jimin and Jung Kook appeared with bright smiles, offering brief greetings and expressing their sincere gratitude to supporters who had waited for their return.

	“Thank you to the fans and reporters who came to see us,” Jimin said. “It's been a long time, from the pandemic to military service. Now that we're back, we'll work hard to show you what we've prepared.”


	“There were a lot of unforgettable moments,” Jung Kook added. “Thanks to everyone who served with us and supported us along the way.” Jimin also hinted at what's to come: “Now that I'm discharged, I think it's time we continue drawing the picture we had in mind. We'll prepare well and share it with you soon.” He concluded: “Military life wasn't easy, but I'm grateful for the memories. If you see a soldier on the street, a warm gesture can mean a lot.”

	











	The two enlisted together in late 2023, completing basic training at the same boot camp before being assigned to separate units. Jimin served with the military band under the 5th Infantry Division, while Jung Kook completed his service with the Baekma Division.


	During their time in uniform, both BTS members continued to make waves in the music world. Jimin made history as the first Korean solo artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 with his single “Like Crazy” from the album FACE, while Jung Kook's solo debut GOLDEN peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and earned international acclaim across global charts.


	BTS has been on hiatus from group activities since 2023 as members fulfilled their enlistment obligations but with Jin and j-hope, as well as RM and V as of Tuesday and now Jimin and Jung Kook discharged, the group's full return is right around the corner, only awaiting SUGA's return.


	Their highly anticipated first public reunion is set at the upcoming 2025 BTS FESTA, taking place June 13-14 at KINTEX in Goyang, South Korea. The event promises to be a powerful homecoming celebration for fans worldwide and the start of BTS' next chapter.

The disgraced R&B singer, who's serving more than 30 years in prison for sex crimes, claims jail officials tried to have him killed to keep him from revealing prosecutorial misconduct. 


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



R. Kelly is asking to cut short his 30-plus-year sentence for racketeering, sexual abuse and child pornography based on strange new claims that jail officials tried to solicit a fellow inmate to kill him.


	The disgraced R&B star made the eyebrow-raising allegations in a Tuesday (June 10) court filing asking to be released from the Federal Correctional Institution in Butner, N.C., where he's serving multiple decades after being convicted in two separate criminal cases.


	Kelly claims he's no longer safe behind bars because prison officials are trying to have him killed to keep from revealing prosecutorial misconduct he recently uncovered — namely, that his pre-trial cellmate stole his attorney-client communications and shared these private messages with prosecutors.


	According to the motion, prison officials tried to stop this damaging information from getting out by soliciting fellow inmate Mikeal Glenn Stine, a member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang, to kill Kelly.  Kelly's lawyers say that while Stine ultimately did not go through with the alleged assignment, the threat still lingers.


	“More A.B. members are accumulating at his facility,” reads the filing. “More than one has already been approached about carrying out his murder. One of them will surely do what Mr. Stine has not, thereby burying the truth about what happened in this case along with Robert Kelly.”


	The motion includes signed declarations from both Stine and Kelly's former cellmate. In a statement shared with Billboard, Kelly's attorney, Beau Brindley, said, “The evidence we have before us demonstrates the weaponization of the D.O.J. to pursue a public figure through corrupt and criminal means.”


	Brindley added that Kelly's legal team is seeking clemency from President Donald Trump, saying Trump “is the only one with both the power and the courage” to curb such alleged prosecutorial corruption.


	Prosecutors did not immediately return a request for comment on the motion, but they quickly filed papers of their own asking Judge Martha M. Pacold to strike Kelly's filing, which contained the name of a child victim who was anonymized during his trial.


	“Robert Kelly is a serial sexual predator,” wrote prosecutors. “He even documented his sexual abuse of children on film — creating child pornography — such that the abuse would live on in perpetuity. That abuse and harassment continues with defendant's latest filing.”


	Judge Pacold struck the motion as requested and ordered Kelly's team to refile it with the victim's name properly redacted. The judge set a hearing on the matter for Wednesday (June 11) in Chicago.


	Kelly was convicted of a slew of sex crimes at two separate federal trials. A New York jury found him guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking in 2021, and he was convicted of child pornography and enticing minors for sex in Chicago in 2022.


	The former R&B star was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the New York conviction and 20 years in the Chicago case, although the vast majority of the second sentence will overlap with the first. Both convictions have been upheld on appeal.

The Coca Cola Company and Universal Music Group have partnered on the launch of a new imprint, Real Thing Records. or rtr.

	Real Thing Records. has also signed Indian singer, songwriter and producer, Aksomaniac, whose music fuses jazz, hip-hop and R&B with traditional Carnatic music.

	 “The Coca-Cola Company has a rich legacy, one of deep human connection and cultural resonance—breaking barriers and bringing people together across borders and generations,” says Joshua Burke, The Coca-Cola Company's global head of music and culture.

	“Real Thing Records. is designed to unlock greater potential for artists, fans, and our brands—where creativity fuels growth and the combined power of our network and key global music partners create value greater than the sum of its parts,” Burke continues. “It's our intention to let artists shine and give them the flexibility to develop their identities with the support of global reach and expertise. It's a long-term commitment to music—enabling us to reinvest in our programs, champion the next generation of talent, and stay rooted in what matters most: music and fandom.” 


	This is not the first partnership between The Coca Cola Company and UMG, with UMG also previously serving as the label partner for Coke Studio, an initiative that has recruited superstar artists like Usher, Tyla, Karol G, Peggy Gou and NewJeans to participate in projects like original songs, festival experiences and live performances. 


	“For years, Universal Music Group and The Coca-Cola Company have shared a belief in the power of music to spark connection and shape meaningful experiences,” says Universal Music Group for Brands executive vice president Richard Yaffa. “With the launch of Real Thing Records., we are taking that vision further – joining forces to build a modern label that champions artistry and amplifies emerging voices on global and local stages, while giving fans the cultural moments they crave. 


	“Both companies recognize the long-term value of investing in artistic innovation,” Yaffa continues, “and our past work together has consistently demonstrated how music can move people and create lasting impact. The evolution and continued success of our several collaborations stands as a testament to what's possible when we align creativity with cultural relevance.”

	Before leaving the burning booth, Nicki wasn't done and she sent a shot at the NFL about their choices for the Super Bowl Halftime Show, which overlooked Wayne in his hometown earlier this year. “NFL, fire some n—s and then call us,” she spews in defense of the Young Money boss. 

	











Tha Carter VI arrived on Friday (June 6) filled with 19 tracks and features from Kodak Black, MGK, Bono, BigXthaPlug, Jelly Roll and Big Sean. The “Banned From NO (Remix)” marks the first Weezy-Minaj collaboration since 2023's “RNB” from Pink Friday 2.

	A sequel of Cartoon Network hit Steven Universe is being developed for Prime Video.


Steven Universe: Lars of the Stars explores the past, present and future of the universe. The sequel follows Lars Barriga, eternal teenager and space outlaw, as he and his pirate crew smuggle contraband, evade the authorities and uncover the darkest secrets of the fallen Gem Empire.


	The news was unveiled at Annecy by creator and EP Rebecca Sugar at a Cartoon Network Studios and Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe session. 


	Telling the coming-of-age story of a young boy with friends and aliens in the fictional town of Beach City, Steven Universe has been hugely popular for Cartoon Network, running for five seasons and 160 episodes.

	Sugar will EP the sequel with producing partner Ian Jones-Quartey.

	“I miss my world and my characters,” she said. “I can't wait to share [the sequel] with you and can't thank you enough for all your support.” 


	Meanwhile, Cartoon Network has given a 10th season to the longest-running animated series in DC history, Teen Titans Go!.

Associate Editor, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Jessica Frances Dukes (Ozark, The Gilded Age) has been set as a series regular in MGM+ series The Westies, the upcoming period crime drama series from Chris Brancato, co-creator, executive producer, and showrunner.


	Co-created by Brancato and Michael Panes, The Westies is set in the early 1980s when the construction of the Jacob Javitz Convention Center on the Westies' home turf in Hell's Kitchen promises a financial windfall for the Irish-American organized crime gang. Despite being outnumbered 50-to-1 by the Five Families of the Italian mafia, The Westies' legendary brutality and cunning have given them the leverage necessary to share the spoils through a fragile détente. However, internal conflict between the brash younger generation and the old-school leadership threatens to set a match to this powder keg, which will sweep the Westies into the FBI's ever-deepening investigation into the Italian mafia.

Acme': “We Are Lucky To Do Art In Our Profession But We Can't Lock Ourselves In A Basement”","https://deadline.com/2025/06/the-cat-in-the-hat-team-defend-warner-bros-coyote-vs-acme-1236430582/","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 11:09:00 GMT","


					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


	The team behind Warners' upcoming The Cat in the Hat movie have defended the studio's decision to shelve Coyote vs. Acme, saying that the episode should not “become representative of how painful and atrocious the industry can be.” 


	Speaking during a Work in Progression session at Annecy, Alessandro Carloni, who is co-writing and directing The Cat in the Hat, said he has landed six movie directing roles across his career and only finished two of them. 


	“It's that kind of industry,” he added. “You have to go with the frustration. We are lucky to do art in our profession but we can't lock ourselves in a basement and paint a painting. We get to do things that are huge and expensive and it is a business.”

	Carloni was responding to a question about the shelving of Coyote vs. Acme, which took place in late 2023 leading to an estimated $30M write-down on the $70M production for the David Zaslav-led conglom.




			Watch on Deadline		







	While “some of us are unlucky to have lost projects,” Carloni warned against “one specific case” becoming “representative of how painful and atrocious the industry can be.”


	Erica Rivinoja, who co-wrote and directed The Cat in the Hat with Carloni, pointed out that Coyote vs. Acme will in fact get a U.S. release following its sale to Ketchup Entertainment, which we revealed several weeks back.


	Rivinoja said there is a very simple thing audiences can do to help avoid future cancellations. “Go to the movies,” she said. “Go to the big ones, go to the small ones, don't just stream them.” 

	











“AI is never going to be as f**ked up in the head as me”


	Artificial intelligence and its dangers has been a hot button topic at this year's Annecy and Rivinoja was unequivocal that The Cat in the Hat has not used the invasive tech in its creation.


	“I feel like AI is never going to be as f**ked up in the head as me so I am not as worried about it coming up with our big ideas,” she joked. “We want to support our artists and support our humans.” 


	For Carloni, some of the “fascination” behind great animated content is to “enjoy and admire the person who created something beautiful.” “Part of our fascination is to enjoy intent as much as content,” he added. “Otherwise you have to think why we still have weightlifting in the Olympics when you can just use a forklift. Our joy comes from enjoying the human endeavor.”


	The movie does use certain software in order to ensure that the rhymes of Dr Seuss' famous feline creation are structured in iambic pentameter, Carloni explained.


	The team talked a packed Annecy crowd through the making of the movie, which stars Bill Hader, Matt Berry and Quinta Brunson and is due for release next year, while showing a number of early-stage clips including one of the infamous ‘Things'. 


	The movie explores what happens at the end of the beloved 1957 Dr Seuss book, Carloni explained, once the cat goes home and visits his “outlandish office,” where he is given assignments.


	“We looked back at the book and wondered why the children become more confident by the end of the books,” added Carloni. “Deep down, is [the cat] the greatest child psychologist of all time? The greatest emotional support animal?”


	The movie is effectively set across three worlds – the cats, the children's and the adventures they journey on – and the production team talked Annecy through the challenges behind making these worlds disparate while keeping to an all-encompassing tone. 


	The movie is due for release next year, 23 years after the previous adaptation starring Mike Myers and Alec Baldwin. The team were speaking at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival.

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


Netflix is turning to a French icon for its latest feature film.


	The streaming service has greenlit a retelling of the life of Quasimodo, the man said to have inspired Victor Hugo's bell-ringer in The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. 


Vincent Cassel (La Haine) has been cast in the titular role. Jean-Francois Richet (Plane) is set to direct a script penned by Eric Besnard (Wrath of Man). Mediawan's Radar Films is housing the feature, with Clément Miserez and Matthieu Warter producing. 


	Here's the Quasimodo logline: “Set in Paris on the eve of the July Revolution (1830), this film reimagines the life of the man said to have inspired Victor Hugo's iconic character, Quasimodo. As the cholera epidemic spreads through the city, he's caught between political turmoil and an impossible love.”

	











	Cassel, who is no stranger to starring in screen adaptations of French classics after appearing in Asterix & Obelix: The Middle Kingdom, will embody a character that has a long association with the big screen. Quasimodo was depicted by Anthony Hopkins in 1982's The Hunchback of Notre Dame, while Tom Hulce voiced the role in Disney's 1996 animation.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Netflix will get cameras rolling on Quasimodo this summer in France.

Senior International Film Correspondent


EXCLUSIVE: Gkids has acquired multiple territories for Japanese animated action sci-fi drama All You Need Is Kill, including for North America, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.


	The movie is based on the eponymous best-selling novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka which also inspired Doug Liman's 2014 live-action adaptation Edge of Tomorrow with Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt.


	The directorial debut of Kenichiro Akimoto, with a script written by Yuichiro Kido, the new animated adaptation world premiered at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival earlier this week in the Midnight Specials section.

All You Need Is Kill is produced by Warner Bros. Japan with animation production by celebrated Japanese animation house Studio 4°C (Tekkonkinkreet, Mind Game). 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Studio 4°C, which is also at Annecy this year with Yasuhiro Aoki's drama ChaO in the main competition,  will be hosting a studio presentation at the festival on Friday, in the presence of the directors and producers for both titles. 


	Set in the near future, All You Need Is Kill follows the story of Rita, a resourceful but isolated young woman volunteering to help rebuild Japan after the mysterious appearance of a massive alien flower known as “Darol.”


	When Darol unexpectedly erupts in a deadly event, unleashing monstrous creatures that decimate the population, Rita is caught in the destruction—and killed. But then she wakes up again. And again. 


	Caught in an endless time loop, Rita must navigate the trauma and repetition of death until she crosses paths with Keiji, a shy young man trapped in the same cycle. Together, they fight to break free from the loop and find meaning in the chaos around them.

	











	“With All You Need Is Kill, I wanted to convey that even in the endless loop of life, we can still make discoveries and grow, depending on how we perceive the situation,” said Akimoto.


	“All You Need Is Kill is a standout work that explores time, identity, and survival with breathtaking animation and a powerful emotional core,” said Gkids President Dave Jesteadt. “The story has remained so meaningful for years because it captures something essential about the human condition, and the need to keep moving forward. Director Akimoto has created a brilliant new take that we are sure fans will love.”


	Gkids and Studio 4°C have previously collaborated on releases for Mind Game, Children of the Sea, while Gkids also recently acquired ChaO, and several other celebrated titles. 


	Further details on the release will be announced at a later date.


	The deal was negotiated between GKIDS' Director of Acquisitions and Development Rodney Uhler, and Warner Bros. Japan.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce fans are becoming more convinced that the power couple is secretly married, thanks to a tiny detail spotted in an unsuspecting photo.

On Monday, June 9, Cole Kmet and Emily Jarosz's wedding planner, Ellie Nottoli, shared details of the couple's big day on Instagram, including “love notes” for the guests.

Eagle-eyed fans quickly zeroed in on a light blue envelope addressed to Swift and Kelce, confirming the power couple was on the guest list. But what made it eyebrow-raising was the way the couple's name was written.

The envelope, featuring elegant calligraphy that read “Taylor and Travis Kelce” alongside a “Table 13” seating assignment, quickly stirred excitement among fans. Apparently, many take this as proof that the singer and NFL star are now husband and wife.

One excited fan commented on X, “Would be a welcome surprise for them! If true, hope they always share happiness together.”

Another speculated, “I think they're married in court. The real wedding will happen later.”

Someone wrote, “This feels like something we shouldn't be seeing,” while another chimed in, “Taylor Kelce, it has a lovely ring to it.”

Meanwhile, some were not convinced that Swift and Kelce are actually married now. One fan pointed out, “This is very common for couples (married and unmarried) for weddings. It's the aesthetic.”

Another shared the same sentiment, “I'm engaged, but even when we were dating, invited would be addressed to ‘<fiancés name> and <fiancé's last name>'. It's not that weird. It's solely for aesthetic purposes.”

Swift and Kelce skipped Kmet and Jarosz's wedding, but they did step out for another nuptials on Friday, June 6, per People. The couple attended Kelce's cousin Tanner Corum's wedding in Tennessee. 

Whether or not the rumors of a secret marriage are true, Swift and Kelce's relationship is stronger than ever. According to Daily Mail, everyone is just waiting for the two to take their relationship to the next level.

A source told the outlet that Swift's parents are ready to give their blessing to Kelce when he asks for her hand in marriage.

“Nothing seems to be imminent, but it will 100 percent happen,” the insider added. “Taylor and Travis are treating this relationship as their last relationship, and when they get engaged, when they get married and when they start a family, it will be exactly when it is meant to happen.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Kim Zolciak and Kroy Biermann Finally Out of Their Atlanta Mansion","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/kim-zolciak-kroy-biermann-removed-mansion/","Wed, 11 Jun 2025 15:33:08 GMT","

It is the end of an era for one former “Real Housewives of Atlanta” couple. Kim Zolciak and Kroy Biermann have finally exited the Georgia mansion that was the backdrop for numerous fights and police calls.

According to Page Six, the US Marshals intervened and removed them from the home on April 8, 2025. As per a court filing, four deputy marshals “ejected” Zolciak and Biermann from the Atlanta mansion from 3:30 p.m. to 6:45 p.m.

The former reality star and the ex-NFL player finally sold their mansion in February 2025 for $2.75 million — $3 million less than the original asking price — after it was on the market for a year and a half.

The 15,000-square-foot home is a luxurious property with a heated pool, five fireplaces, a six-car garage, an elevator, an arcade room, a movie theater, a gym, and more.

The new owners of the Atlanta estate began the process of legally removing the former couple from the home last December, according to new court documents obtained by Page Six. In the filing, the new owners claimed that Zolcial and Biermann held “the premises over and beyond the term for which they rented to them.”

They also claimed that the estranged couple had already been served the papers for the “proceeding against a tenant holding over.” Those filings from the owners went unanswered.

According to Page Six, Kroy Biermann filed for divorce from Kim in the summer of 2023, and now that the issues with their Georgia mansion have been resolved, the exes are finally able to focus on what they hope is a positive future. 

Kim has relocated to a rental property with their four minor children: Kroy Jr. (also known as KJ), 14, Kash, 12, and 11-year-old twins Kaia and Kane. They also share daughters Brielle, 28, and Ariana, 23, whom Biermann adopted back in 2012. It might be the perfect time for her to return to television, with a camera following her as she rebuilds her now-single life. 

According to Ariana Biermann, Kroy has stepped away from the drama and is living a quiet life by himself. The ex-reality star has also undergone a serious career change. He now oversees logistics and helps with improving workplace efficiency at Superior Rigging and Erecting Co.

Tarek and Heather El Moussa's recent trip to Las Vegas was one big, happy family getaway, according to a social media post the HGTV stars shared on June 6, 2025. In the photos and videos Heather posted of the time spent with their parents, there was no mention of any drama.

But on June 10, TMZ reported that Tarek, 43, was cited for battery by Las Vegas police during the trip, after getting into a physical altercation with a man at The Palazzo at the Venetian Resort. The reason? Sources say he was sticking up for his 77-year-old dad. 

A post shared by Heather Rae El Moussa (@theheatherraeelmoussa)

On June 5, per TMZ, law enforcement got involved when Tarek and another male got into an altercation at the Venetian. The outlet said witnesses at the upscale hotel observed the “Flipping 101” star deliver a “brutal knee to the man's head, knocking him out cold” and that the man looked “seriously roughed up.”

People magazine later reported that the fight occurred when a man allegedly began harassing Tarek's dad. El Moussa received a citation for battery from Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officers, but was not arrested, and neither man requested medical assistance, the outlet said. 

The El Moussas were in town to see Tarek speak and brought their parents — Heather's mom and dad;  Tarek's mom Dominique El Moussa and her second husband, Robert Carroll; and Tarek's dad, Bill Arnould. 

No one in the family has commented on the reports, but Heather shared a happy Instagram post the day after the altercation, on June 6, captioning a photo of the group, “Not our average Vegas trip…Watched Tarek do his thing on stage (so proud!) and made it extra special by bringing our parents along for the ride. We got to show them a glimpse behind the scenes — our world, our work, and of course, the glam. Grateful for these moments that we get to spend together.”

On June 9, Tarek shared multiple videos in his Instagram Stories of himself at Target buying toys for his boys — two-year-old Tristan, whom he shares with Heather, and 10-year-old Brayden, whom he shares with first wife Christina Haack — as well as playing at a playground with them and doing trying virtual reality experience with Brayden. 

“Recap of boys weekend…” he wrote, while Heather was away on a girls' trip,. “Had the best weekend with my boys. This virtual reality was such a cool experience.”

A post shared by Tarek El Moussa (@therealtarekelmoussa)

Tarek's parents met and married when they were young, he told Country Living in 2018, explaining, “My dad was raised Catholic in the Middle East in Lebanon and then Egypt. My mom's from Belgium and my dad moved to Europe when he was in his late teens.”

Though they later divorced, both have continued to be deeply involved in Tarek's life. His mom has appeared on his HGTV shows, including on “The Flip Off” in early 2025, and frequently appears in his and Heather's social media posts as a doting mom and grandma. But his dad is seen much more rarely. 

In 2017, Tarek celebrated his dad's 70th birthday by posting a family photo on Facebook and writing, “Happy 70th old man!!! The relationship between a father and his children is so important. I was lucky enough to have a supportive and motivating father that made me believe I could accomplish anything in the world. I can say that I wouldn't be where I am today without the support of my dad. I will take all the lessons I've learned from him and pass it on to my children. So dad Happy Birthday and I love you!”

For Father's Day in 2022, Tarek shared an Instagram photo of himself with his dad and sister, Angelique, and wrote, “I never realized how important a good dad was until later in my life. Looking back, I realize I've found so much of my success through the lessons my dad taught me growing up. We were always together training for baseball. If it wasn't for him, I'm not sure where I'd be today. He always taught me the importance of working hard and building one's confidence. He would never let me quit, he would always teach me to work harder. Now, that I'm a dad, it's my turn to teach these valuable lessons to my kiddos. I hope you all have an amazing Father's Day and happy Father's Day to my dad!❤️”

As fans tuned in for the third week of “America's Got Talent” (AGT) season 20, they were treated to lots of entertaining contestants, including — as happens in each episode — some who rose to the top in the their eyes. 

Simon Cowell, Howie Mandel, Sofía Vergara, and Melanie “Mel B” Brown get to award the Golden Buzzer to contestants who impress them the most, and one amazing talent brought Mel B to her feet during the first hour of the show on June 10, 2025. 

SPOILER ALERT: If you do not want to know who got the Golden Buzzer tonight, do not continue reading. 

A post shared by America's Got Talent – AGT (@agt)

Singer Charity Lockhart told the judges that she is 49, and that she loves to sing and loves her two children. She made Cowell laughed when she joked, “They're little, one is 27, and the other one I can hold, he's 21!” 

Lockhart shared that when they actually were little and she got divorced, “we ended up living in a car.”

“All I had was my voice, and so I went to clubs and I went to bars, and I asked live bands if I could sing with them,” she said. “They would give me a little money at the end of the night.” 

The crowd cheered for her, and then Lockhart shared that she entered a local talent show and won enough to pay for her first apartment, and then kept going from there. Her goal, she said smiling, was to “keep singing and, of course, probably collect a Grammy along the way.” 

Cowell said that he believed anything was possible and that they were “all rooting for you” to do well. After getting a drink of water to calm her nerves, Lockhart sang the first few bars of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” a cappella, but Cowell stopped her. 

“I stopped you because I liked you, but it just wasn't working for me,” he said, and the audience gasped.  “AGT” then left viewers in suspense with a commercial break.

After a commercial break, Cowell asked if Lockhart had another song she could sing, saying, “I really want this to work for you, and I know this is a lot of pressure.” 

Lockhart said she'd do her best and chose to sing the Beatles' “Golden Slumbers” with piano accompaniment. As she sang, the judges looked smitten and all wound up giving her a standing ovation. 

“This is what a great audition is all about,” Cowell said, telling Lockhart people would be talking about her the following day. 

Mel Be, still standing, told Lockhart before hitting the Golden Buzzer, “Every once in a while, you see somebody, you connect with them, and they just bring more and more to the table. I think you're amazing and I want to give you this right now!” 

The singer covered her mouth in shock and hugged Mel B on the stage as golden confetti fell around her. She'll now get to move on to the live shows in August, bypassing other rounds of the competition.

The lower-security prisoners in Charles Williams' difficult but deeply penetrating “Inside” sometimes pass the time by playing the trivia games that are printed on the packaging of their sweets. “WHO AM I?” the text asks, before offering a series of clues about, say, a Brooklyn-born musician who got his first break when Bette Midler hired him as a pianist. Most of the characters in this decidedly grounded Australian prison drama are too young — and too many worlds removed — to know who Barry Manilow is, let alone guess his identity based on a handful of factoids. But that doesn't stop these men from trying, even if they spend every day of their sentences trying to separate their souls from the bullet points of their own biographies. Are they more than what they've done? The people they've hurt? The situations they were born into?

We know they are. Not because they're human, and we have the natural grace to extend these murderers the courtesy of that recognition, but rather because this film wouldn't have any reason to exist if the answer to any of those questions was “no.” The abundant power of Williams' debut feature — which stems from his experience growing up in an economically dispossessed Victoria town whose jail was like a second home for several of the men in his family — is rooted in the fact that “Inside” never pretends otherwise. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






This is not a story that labors to earn its prisoners their humanity. On the contrary, it's a story about how their clear and inextinguishable humanity is liable to become a prison unto itself. In the borrowed words of long-time inmate Warren Murfett (a bushy and brilliant Guy Pearce): “The worst of men have a little bit of good in them, and that'll be their undoing.” 

Warren is quoting another inmate at the same time as he's mocking the way that some of his fellow convicts try to protect themselves with aphorisms, but some pearls of wisdom are worth carrying around in your pocket like a shiv at the ready. For a man with blood on his hands like Warren, it's that last mote of humanity that might prove to be his doom — the stubborn part of himself that still yearns for redemption, hopes for healing, and strives to make something more of himself before there's nothing left. 

It's the part of himself that 17-year-old Mel Blight (puppy-eyed newcomer Vincent Miller, wrenchingly credible in his first movie role) is already trying to stamp out by the time Williams' film begins to take shape around him. In his opening voiceover, which floats above the sort of glassy synth music that's meant to numb our judgment, Mel informs us that he was conceived during a conjugal visit when his father was in prison, and that his dad once told him that he was destined to wind up back behind bars. “And he was right.” A broken home gave way to juvenile detention, and the violence that followed him there saw Mel transferred to general population — not unheard of in a country where kids as young as 10 can be locked away indefinitely. 

 










Now that he's inching toward parole, Mel's doing everything in his power to fuck it up. “They want me to make a story out of it and pretend I've changed,” he says when asked to write a letter of contrition to the boy he beat to death in juvie. “But I haven't changed. No one does, especially inside.” By “inside” he means prison, but Williams' delicate script obviously intends for us to recognize that he means inside himself as well. 

If this film is able to afford such an explicit double entendre, that's because of how truthfully it grapples with the nuances of rehabilitation — with the crooked path these men are meant to walk from sin to salvation, and with the practical realities of returning to a world that may no longer have a place for them in it. Like so many of the people he meets in prison, Mel doesn't think he's worthy of being released. “There's something broken inside of us,” he writes in one of his letters, and it's easier for him to own that spiritual dysfunction than to risk the heartache of failing to overcome it. 

That's a big part of the initial reason why Warren takes Mel under his wing: The kid is the perfect candidate to kill the most hated man in prison, whose bounty would be enough to pay off Warren's dire gambling debt. The target's name is Mark Shepard (a slack-jawed Cosmo Jarvis, who continues to be one of the most gifted chameleons in modern cinema), he became a national sensation when he was convicted for the rape and murder of a young girl when he was only 13 years old himself, and — after earning a transfer out of maximum security — he happens to be Mel's new cellmate. 

 










What separates Mark from the other two characters in this movie's core triangle is that he's evangelically convinced of his own absolution, to the point that he delivers Pentecostal sermons to the world's most hostile congregation. He even ropes Mel into playing the prayer room keyboard as he preaches. It's a little detail, but also one emblematic of the irreconcilable tension that “Inside” would rather articulate than resolve; Williams often lingers on the image of Mel sitting focused at the piano, forcing us to guess whether the kid is starting to entertain the possibility of self-deliverance, or whether he's plotting how to stab the man at the pulpit. Of course, Mel's dilemma isn't so black-and-white, especially because offing a “monster” of Mark's caliber might be the shortest possible route to getting right with God. 

“Inside” eventually builds to a clear moment of choice for the sake of its own climax, but the vast majority of this movie is spent complicating its characters' logic rather than framing their choices as some moral binary. Not only do Williams and Jarvis conspire to rescue a mottled innocence from the recesses of Mark's tortured mind (a process that hinges on a truly shocking reveal), but Pearce's layered and wrenchingly humane performance eventually reveals Warren to be the heart of the film.

 










That isn't because Warren evolves from the diabolical manipulator that he seems to be at the start of this story, but rather because we bear witness to how the character reframes himself as his greatest mark. He might tell Mel that breaking their cycles of violence is as foolish as thinking a different song might come on when you replay a tape, but some of his actions suggest otherwise, and the surrogate father role Warren assumes while coaching Mel towards another murder starts to affect the older man after he suffers a disastrous visit with his actual son during a brief furlough (“Babyteeth” breakout Toby Wallace is outstanding in the crucial one-scene role). The Joker-like shot of Warren sticking his head out of a car window on the way back to jail, his beard blasting against his face in the wind, is an unforgettably poignant snapshot of a man who's free from everything but himself. 

“Inside” is a small and constrained prison drama, even by the inflexible standards of its genre, and yet Williams' debut is so replete with such moments of raw compassion that it almost invisibly accumulates a deep well of emotion — one that allows the film to feel much bigger than it looks by the time it arrives at its absolute knockout of a final scene. There are a few small cheats along the way, but “Inside” is averse to didacticism and neoliberal heart-softening when it counts, and the power it achieves in the end is inextricable from the honesty with which it's earned. “Who Am I?” is a mystery that none of these characters may ever be able to solve for themselves, at least not with the certainty of a trivia game on the back of a candy wrapper, but to watch them look for the answers in each other is enough to convince us that the question is always worth asking. 

 










“Inside” screened at the 2025 Tribeca Festival. Quiver Distribution will release it in theaters on Friday, June 20.

“The Backrooms,” the viral YouTube horror series that has amassed nearly 200 million views since debuting in 2022, is officially becoming a feature film. A24 has greenlit a movie based on the property directed by 19-year-old series creator Kane Parsons, who will be the youngest director in A24 history when the film enters production this summer. 

Chiwetel Ejiofor and Renate Reinsve will star in “The Backrooms,” which is a co-production between A24 and Chernin Entertainment. James Wan and Shawn Levy will executive produce through their Atomic Monster and 21 Laps banners, respectively. Roberto Patino is also a producer. Chernin Entertainment, part of The North Road Company, will co-finance alongside A24.

While plot details for the film have been kept under wraps, the YouTube series used the found-footage format to gradually build a horror universe about liminal spaces that exist in our world without fully conforming to our reality. The slow builds and homemade special effects helped the eerie videos build a loyal following.

A24's feature take on “The Backrooms,” which was first announced in 2023, has been cited as one of Hollywood's most significant investments in intellectual property that emerged from the internet. In Vol. 005 of the In Development newsletter from IndieWire's Future of Filmmaking, editor-in-chief Dana Harris-Bridson argued that Parsons represents the new archetype for indie film success in the 2020s.

“This sounds like a 21st-century riff on the Sundance wunderkind, but A24 didn't buy a short from a promising high school filmmaker. It bought an ecosystem,” she wrote of his success. “Scalable IP, with a built-in fanbase. Proof of engagement. Potential for merch, spin-offs, and platform-native storytelling. It's a lot less romantic than the ‘90s story, in which credit-card debt is burned away by a life-altering festival premiere that sends buyers huddling in the lobby to craft eight-figure offers. However, we can't believe in that folktale if we also believe in the internet. Thirty years ago, a rapturous reception was the only tool distributors had to project future results. In reality, the digital revolution in filmmaking happened at the same time as all the other digital revolutions. Today, no one relies on analog instinct for pretty much the same reason that you don't have a landline.”No release date for “The Backrooms” has been announced.

It sounds like a horror story: a lauded Hollywood icon readies their directorial debut with an entertaining and deeply personal fact-based film, casts a slew of big names (including themselves), shoots on an indie budget, takes it all the way to the Toronto International Film Festival for its world premiere, and then (then!) opts to recut the entire thing in hopes of securing a buyer in our increasingly fraught film landscape.

That's the story of Patricia Arquette's “Gonzo Girl,” but while other filmmakers might view the experience as a nightmare, the worst possible scenario, a kick against creative freedom, the Oscar winner has a different take on the whole thing: what a neat opportunity.

“I feel so grateful to the producers and for this opportunity to go back in and continue to learn about the filmmaking process and be able to re-edit this movie,” Arquette told IndieWire over Zoom. “It's been really fun and interesting, and so many people have helped in this process. It's exciting.”

 










For Arquette, the joy is doubled. As she sees it, she got to make both the “American version” and the “European cut” of her first film. Who else can say that?

When Arquette's film, based on Cheryl Della Pietra's memoir of the same name, premiered at TIFF 2023, this writer was enthusiastic about it, hailing its performances and high energy. Based on Della Pietra's own experiences working as Hunter S. Thompson's assistant (here, turned into “Walker Reade,” played by a perfectly cast Willem Dafoe), the film is mostly set on the writer's Colorado compound, and follows a young Della Pietra avatar as she falls into a truly gonzo way of living.

The “girl” of the film's title is Alley Russo, played by a luminous Camila Morrone. But after TIFF, Arquette and her team wondered if perhaps Alley's journey was not grounded enough within the framework of the film. Thus: recut. Now, almost two years later, the new version of the film is premiering at Tribeca Festival, where Arquette hopes to capture more eyeballs, attention, and maybe even a smart buyer.

“It's like the whole time that we were editing the movie, there was always this push to get into festivals, to prematurely be ready to try to apply to all these festivals,” Arquette said. “It's such a weird kind of a push, and it really is detrimental, I think, to the whole editing process.”

 










Still, Arquette has no knocks against that first cut, and she sees it in concert with the new version. “I actually really liked that cut of the movie,” she said. “I look at it more like the European cut. There's some more space in things, just to kind of absorb things. There's less handholding of the audience through where Alley is at from moment to moment. You have to be more engaged as an audience member of [the original cut], whereas this one is much more streamlined.” (The new version is about 11 minutes shorter than the one that played at TIFF.)

This new one? It's “the American version of that same movie,” as Arquette sees it. “We took a lot of this kind of space out of the movie and included some more stuff to follow through and clarify her journey and where she's coming from,” Arquette said. “This is a rite of passage of a young woman, and we don't really see so many of those. She's very idealistic when she starts this movie. Throughout the movie, she's exploring different aspects of her power, of her beauty, and she is subconsciously kind of agreeing to things that maybe she's not comfortable with. By the end, she has a strength where she can challenge things.”

Arquette also appears in the film (both versions!) as her own sort of Gonzo Girl, playing Claudia, Walker's long-suffering assistant, maid, chef, house manager, accountant, and much more. Asked how she made the choice to co-star, Arquette laughed. It wasn't really a choice, more of a “prerequisite” from her financiers. But while Arquette said she initially worried that her focus might be split between her two roles on the production, the whole thing proved to be pretty freeing.

 










“What was good about it, I really only gave myself a take or two and very little coverage, I felt like, ‘OK, I know what I'm going to do with this part, so I'm just going to do it really fast and I'll have all this extra time to devote to everyone else,'” she recalled. “There's a couple of scenes in the movie that I laugh at because I'd be wearing whatever, a T-shirt and jeans, and then the wardrobe lady would be like, ‘What are you going to wear in this next scene? You're in the next scene.' And she'd roll stuff in, and I'd be like, ‘Grab a schmatta and throw it over the top of my stuff.' ‘What about hair and makeup?' I'd be like, ‘Just grab me that headband and put it on.'”

That also spoke to her character. “Claudia is the opposite side [of Alley], almost like the Ghislaine Maxwell,” she said. “When you've traded yourself off totally, who cares what I look like? Who cares what my needs are? Who cares whatever? I'm the cleanup person. I'll be the bad guy. I'm going to fix this. I'll be the mommy. You can complain and whine to me, and I will clean up your draw-up and fix your NDAs and get your drugs and whatever it is, and have you sleep with other people, and it's OK. I wanted to show that side of it, too.”

Having Arquette, Dafoe, and rising star Morrone on deck is an enviable enough prospect for any first-time director, but the filmmaker was also eager to point out her stacked supporting cast. Turns out, she's good at this casting thing, too.

 










“That's another thing I feel really excited about. I had a very good eye,” she said with a laugh. “Since then, everyone's been working a lot. Zoë [Bleu Sidel], she's got two big movies coming out. Ray [Nicholson]'s been super busy, and oh, my God, Leila [George] and Elizabeth [Lail] are so busy, so it's just exciting.”

Arquette was also clear: This was not all the product of good instincts. In fact, when it came to casting Morrone in the lead role, Arquette said she had to push back against some of her own biases and see the performer in front of her.

“I had a really amazing compliment on the movie the other day from an incredible actor, and they were like, ‘Oh, my God. She won me over times a thousand,'” she said. “Honestly, she won me over in the audition. I'm embarrassed to say this, but I almost didn't hire her because I thought, ‘Oh, my God, is she too pretty? Is she too pretty, and is it too distracting?' And then I thought, ‘Wait a minute, this is not cool. What am I saying? You were given too much when you were born? You're too pretty? Stay in the pretty box over there. You're not allowed to have these other talents. You're not allowed to explore these other things.' I did have to challenge myself and my own subconscious bias about beauty and about all of that.”

 










The result speaks for itself. “She is amazing in it, and she was so committed to it, and I think she really also understood this,” Arquette said. “It was this moment in her life where she was very vulnerable; she just had her heart broken and really put it all on screen.”

And, like Arquette, Morrone embraced the constraints of indie filmmaking with gusto. “No one with a prissy attitude could have survived that,” the filmmaker said. “‘Can you go change in the closet over there? We have 10 minutes. We don't have a dressing room. We have that little area that's got flies in it. Do you mind? Is it OK?' Nothing was easy.”

That sentiment seems to extend even to today. After screening at TIFF to mostly positive (if mixed) reviews, the film didn't find a buyer. With its Tribeca premiere this week, Arquette hopes to change that.

“I do think it's definitely a reset because I think it's a pretty significant recut of the movie,” she said. “The way that the movie feels is much more polished now and finished and kind of moves faster, and it leaves the audience with a bit of a different feeling. I think, honestly, every year or every six months, there's a reset at all these companies. What is their agenda? Who's working where? What are people's appetites? How adventurous they want to be? It's always an ever-changing industry, and I feel like we're in a big change right now.”

 










One of those changes that Arquette is not squeamish about: the possibility that “Gonzo Girl” might go to a streamer, not the usual theatrical release route. 

“Streamers are making so much of the movies and the content right now, you just can't have a realistic conversation without having them in the mix,” she said. “They are picking up a lot of content, and they are getting millions of eyes all over the world to see things. It was a lifesaver during COVID, and yes, we could argue that it's also been to the detriment of in-person theaters, but I do think that there has already been a bit of a resurgence, and I think that that will continue with theaters. I think that, with streamers, there will be a hybrid where they will have things come out in theaters for a certain period of time, and they'll go to their streamer.”

Arquette's longtime friend, collaborator, and “Boyhood” filmmaker Richard Linklater is no stranger to streamers, I noted, with both his “Hit Man” and his recent Cannes pick “Nouvelle Vague” heading to Netflix. Some people might gnash their teeth or beat their fists over that, but Arquette is pragmatic.

“‘Nouvelle Vague' was always going to go to a streamer eventually,” she said. “You need people to buy these things, and you want people to support them, and you want people to also be able to afford an awards campaign with a movie like that if you are worthy, if the performances are worthy, so yeah, we've got to be realistic.”

 










All that said, where is the perfect home for “Gonzo Girl,” American cut and all? 

“I'm hoping that it's somebody who has some nerve, somebody who's bold, somebody who understands, who loved movies like ‘Hurlyburly' and movies like that, and understand that there's some value in that,” Arquette said. “I hope that we end up with a distributor who gets it, who sees how beautiful the performances are and special and celebrates those and understands and wants to get into the weeds about all the different conversations [in this film].”

As for future filmmaking endeavors, Arquette is focused on a) getting this baby out in the world and b) her many acting gigs (she was gearing up for another day on the set of Hulu's upcoming Murdaugh murders series when we spoke, in the midst of Emmy campaigning for “Severance”). Still, it sounds like she's got the directing bug.

“I still kind of feel like, until I get [‘Gonzo Girl'] out and distributed and I support it, I don't really have room on my dance card to think of something else, but little weird, obscure thoughts do come to me,” she said.

Arquette also finds the time to enthusiastically and frequently support all sorts of organizations (from her safe sanitation-focused organization GiveLove to breast cancer awareness), and is often posting on her social channels about causes ranging from abortion access and election rights to Gaza and anti-fascism (her Instagram bio: “actress. activist. troublemaker”). How, I wondered, does she stay positive and creative — about the current state of the world, about recutting her passion project, about just existing? — given everything else going on.  

 










“I just feel like I'm one of millions and millions of people watching this, shocked by this, trying to adjust, scared for their kids, trying to make a plan, scrambling around watching the collapse of multiple industries and the readjustment of things,” Arquette said. “I try not to get too deep into my fear, because the maternal part of me wants to take care of everybody, and the maternal part of me is scared for everybody. I have to say thank God I'm in the creative work, because it does give me a respite.”

She added, “I also love beauty. I love not just the art of movie-making, but I love the art of design, decor, textiles, things women have made in different cultures, like the food that people make in different cultures and communities. Sometimes, I just have to step back and appreciate some beautiful woman I'm watching make a tortilla, like, ‘OK, we have been human for a long time. We have gotten through these crazy things many times, many strange kinds of things.' I try to just have faith in the goodness of mankind.”

“Gonzo Girl” will next screen at the 2025 Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

11 years ago, Keanu Reeves hadn't had a hit movie in several years, Chad Stahelski was a stunt performer who had yet to direct a movie, and action cinema was in a bit of a rut. All that changed with the release of a little movie called “John Wick,” one that brought some much-needed spark to its genre.

Named after Reeves' taciturn lead, the original 2014 “John Wick” was on paper a relatively straightforward revenge story, following a legendary hitman who reenters the criminal underworld to get revenge on the men who killed his dog (a storyline that provided a long-lasting icon for animal lovers everywhere). What made it stand out against a sea of similar films was the care with which Stahelski and writer Derek Kolstad fleshed out this world, placing Wick's quest for vengeance in an over-the-top universe of cartoonish assassins who abide by their own rules and have centuries of history guiding their actions. Add in tightly executed fight scenes often captured in long takes and the film felt like almost nothing else in theaters at the time — a novelty that only helped it become a surprise box office hit.

Sequels soon followed, with Reeves returning and Stahelski still directing, and while action sequels are often in danger of spinning their wheels, the opposite happened here. In the three continuations released in 2017, 2019, and 2023, the John Wick films only became more ambitious, deepening its comic book-esque criminal underworld and sharpening its signature approach to action, while Reeves settled into the role to such an extent that it threatened to unseat Neo in “The Matrix” as his signature performance. Each film did better and better at the box office, from $86 million during its first go around to $447.3 million with “Chapter 4.” And, in the final movie, the film offered a rare thing in Hollywood filmmaking: a definite ending.

At least, that's how it felt at the time. While “Chapter 4” ended with a satisfying end point for Wick's journey, the fandom that's built around it and its financial success has ensured that “John Wick” the film series isn't over. A fifth film and several spinoffs are in development, but first there's “Ballerina” (or, to use it's clunky full title, “From the World of John Wick: Ballerina”), a “sidequel” set during the events of the third “John Wick” movie starring as a ballerina/assassin Eve Macarro, on a similar journey for revenge as John was in the first movie. Reeves plays a small but vital role, but the film really seems to be testing if this universe the franchise has built can be successful without the hitman that it previously orbited around.

With “Ballerina” currently in theaters, IndieWire is looking at the entire “John Wick” franchise to determine which film stands tall. This list will only include the four theatrically-released “John Wick” films as well as “Ballerina,” excluding the 2023 Peacock limited series “The Continental.” Read on for all five “John Wick” films, ranked from worst to best.

As a spinoff film of the “Wick” franchise with a new main character and a different filmmaker than Stahelski behind the camera (Len Wiseman, best known for the “Underworld” movies, took over directorial duties), there was a lot of cause for skepticism that “Ballerina” would be a worthy addition to the series. And, at least for the torturous first hour, too many of those concerns bear out in terms of what's on screen. Plodding and dour, the beginning half of “Ballerina” is far too concerned with backstory exposition, monologuing about the baroque rules these assassins live by, and action scenes that lack all of the creativity and nerve that make the films so fun. Then, main character Eva Macarro (Ana de Armas, who never quite nails the tone needed for these movies to work) embarks upon her revenge quest, and the directing — allegedly helped by some reshoots — improves 1000 percent, as the action choreography gets fun, creative, and exhilarating. The result is a massively disjointed film that fails to get us invested in Eva's quest to seek vengeance on the man who murdered her father, with plot twists that lead nowhere and emotional stakes that never pay off. Still, it's fun seeing the script flip, as Reeves plays the heavy this time around, and there's enough good setpieces in the final hour for real “John Wick” heads to still get some kick out of the overall experience. 

The four “John Wick” movies are such strong pieces of entertainment that you're really splitting hairs whichever way you rank them. “Chapter 3” (which, somewhat bizarrely, is the only one with a subtitle — “Parabellum” refers to a type of gun round as well as the Latin phrase “If you want peace, prepare for war”) is by all measures, a very well made piece of pure popcorn entertainment: the action is slick, the cast — which includes great supporting turns from Halle Berry and Anjelica Huston — is spectacular, and the stakes are incredibly high. The only things really weighing down the installment, which focuses on Wick on the run looking for a way to clear his excommunicado status in the underworld, are that the pacing is a little too slack at over two hours, and the cliffhanger ending prevents the story from successfully standing on its own as an singular film. They're small nitpicks that, in a very consistent franchise, look like glaring flaws. 

Compared to the films that would follow, the original “John Wick” feels a little small and intimate — or, as intimate as a film about a legendary hitman fighting hundreds of goons to take revenge on a gangster who wronged him can be. The mythology and world had not fully been fleshed out yet at this point, with aspects like The Continental serving as set dressing for Wick's rampage of revenge. But in terms of pure style, Stahelski nailed the tone and look of the film the first time around, with glorious action scenes (the Red Circle nightclub sequence remains a high point for the franchise) rendered in tight long shots that make every punch thrown and bullet fired connect. The not-so-secret sauce for these movies, however, has always been Keanu Reeves, and beyond his stuntwork, the gravitas he adds to the heartbroken hitman gives the film's story of seeking vengeance for his dog just the right amount of genuine pathos.

Released three years after the first “John Wick” film, “Chapter 2” was where the franchise really found its direction, deepening its world-building and heightening the tone of its baroque criminal underworld. Following the events of the first film, the sequel forces Wick back out of retirement when he's required to fulfill a blood oath he once made to crime lord Santino D'Antonio. The supporting cast — which in this film includes Common, Ruby Rose, and Riccardo Scamarcio as the deliciously evil Santino — pops more, the stakes are higher, and most importantly, the action is more creative and audacious, including a silent subway shootout and a fight in a mirror room that rank among the high points of the series. It's everything a sequel should be. 

From all accounts, the fourth “John Wick” film is not going to be the end of the franchise — it already isn't the last time we've seen Wick, although “Ballerina” was set before the events of this film. But, while there's no indication that any follow-up would be bad, one almost wishes “Chapter 4” was the final chapter for the series, because it's difficult to see any film topping it. Quite simply, the nearly 3-hour action extravaganza is near perfection from beginning to end, a perfectly made epic that moves so breathlessly that it feels about 30 minutes shorter than it actually is. Following Wick on his quest for revenge against the High Table after being left for dead, the film flies across the globe — from New York to Osaka to Paris — and from one perfectly staged setpiece to another: The Osaka Continental fight that kicks things off, the nightclub fight scene to end all nightclub fight scenes, the car fight in Paris, the standout overhead apartment shot, and the fight up the stairs that perfectly exemplifies the movie's mix of dark humor and bloodshed. The cast is easily the best in the entire franchise, with the new additions popping alongside staples like Laurence Fishbourne, Ian McShane, and Lance Reddick: Rina Sawayama shines in a small role, Shamier Anderson is incredibly charismatic as Wick's enemy-turned-ally, Bill Skarsgård hams it up as the villain, and Donnie Yen manages to out-cool Keanu Reeves as Wick's old friend Caine. What really makes “Chapter 4” so satisfying, though, is its perfect finale, which sums up the franchise's themes of vengeance and the cost of bloodshed in a poetic, bloodstained bow. It's as satisfying an ending as any film series has ever managed to reach.

David Harbour is ready to pull up the anchor on “Stranger Things.” The actor, who plays Hopper in the beloved Netflix series, told Interview magazine that he is content that the show will end after five seasons and almost 10 years onscreen. 

“When I started, I loved it so much,” Harbour said. “Buddies of mine who'd done TV shows for many years said, ‘By Season 3 or 4 you'll be running.' And I was like, ‘Never! I love all these guys so much.' And then you get to a certain point where you're like, ‘How much more story is there?'” 

 










He continued, “You're having to play a lot of the same beat, and there's a feeling where you're like, ‘I want to take a risk. I want to do something that people haven't seen me do before.' So yeah, after 10 years, it's like, ‘OK.'”

Harbour previously said during the live “Happy Sad Confused” podcast at Comic Con, via People, that the series finale is the “best episode they've ever done,” adding, “They land the plane.” 

And according to the “Thunderbolts” star, the “Stranger Things” ensemble cast (which includes Millie Bobby Brown, Winona Ryder, Joe Keery, Sadie Sink, Finn Wolfhard, Joseph Quinn, and Maya Hawke) couldn't hold back their emotions during the table read for the last episode. “The end of this [final] episode when we were reading it — just us reading it — about halfway through, people started crying,” Harbour said. “Then about the last 20 minutes, it was just uncontrollably crying, waves of different people. Noah Schnapp being my favorite.” 

Harbour added to the Comic Con audience, “I think part of that also is the fact that these kids, it was their childhood. It's 10 years later, and we examine that idea, and it's so well done and so beautiful. It's such a great episode, and it's such a great season. You guys will love it.”

Brian Wilson, the co-founder and primary songwriter of the Beach Boys, has died, his family announced. While an official cause of death was not disclosed, the beloved musical auteur, who helped pioneer the studio-as-instrument, influencing generations of musicians in pop and beyond, was revealed in early 2024 to be living with a neurocognitive disorder akin to dementia. Wilson was 82 years old.

“We are heartbroken to announce that our beloved father Brian Wilson has passed away,” his family wrote in a statement shared on Wilson's official Facebook. “We are at a loss for words right now. Please respect our privacy at this time as our family is grieving. We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world. Love & Mercy.”

Born in Inglewood, California, Wilson formed the band—then called the Pendletones—as a teenager with his brothers Dennis and Carl, their cousin Mike Love, and high school friend Al Jardine. Their first song, “Surfin',” was released by Candix Records, who changed the band's name to the Beach Boys without the members' permission. A year later, the band signed with Capitol to release its debut, Surfin' Safari; the following year, “Surfin' U.S.A.” became the Beach Boys' first U.S. Top 10 single. In 1963, the band released three albums: Surfin' U.S.A., Surfer Girl, and Little Deuce Coupe. By then, Wilson had started his career as a producer for other musicians. He worked with Jan and Dean, the Castellas, Donna Loren, Sharon Marie, and others.

In 1964, Brian Wilson decided to stop touring with the Beach Boys after experiencing a panic attack due to the band's heavy schedule. He focused on his production, and in 1965  started work on the landmark experimental pop album Pet Sounds. Wilson was the mastermind behind the Pet Sounds sessions, working alongside famed studio musicians the Wrecking Crew. At the time of its release, Pet Sounds was considered a relative commercial flop and critical failure. In 2004, it was inducted into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry due to its cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance.

“I wanted to grow musically, so I experimented,” Wilson told the Harvard Business Review in 2016. “I wasn't the type to sit around and be satisfied with an accomplishment, especially not in the studio. And I had ideas coming into my head all the time. Many had to do with using instruments as voices and voices as instruments. I would put sounds together to create something new. Some ideas didn't work, because they were too difficult to achieve at the time. But most did. And then I immediately moved to the next thing.”

Wilson planned a follow-up album called Smile, which he described as a “teenage symphony to God,” but it was scrapped after continual delays. After the album's cancellation in 1967, Wilson's role in the band receded. In 1968, he entered a psychiatric hospital for treatment. In the years after the release of Pet Sounds, Wilson briefly owned and operated a health food store called the Radiant Radish. He continued to work with the band while struggling with drug and alcohol addiction in the '70s.

After a family intervention into Wilson's deteriorating mental and physical health, he became embroiled with the controversial psychologist Eugene Landy. Their decades-long treatment later became the subject of a biographical film called Love & Mercy. The Beach Boys enjoyed a brief resurgence after their 1977 album Love You, but Wilson's health issues persisted. In 1982, Landy removed him from the band for intensive treatment and exercised increasing control over Wilson's financial and creative endeavors, prompting Wilson to release his debut solo album in 1988. In 1992, following legal action from Carl Wilson and other members of the Wilson family, Landy's psychology license was revoked and he received a restraining order from Wilson.

Wilson eventually revisited Smile, reworking the archived studio sessions with Darian Sahanaja to bring the once-scrapped project to a live concert. He released Brian Wilson: Presents Smile in 2004 to critical acclaim. He continued to release solo work in the 2000s. His last solo album of original material was 2015's No Pier Pressure, which featured contributions from Kacey Musgraves and Zooey Deschanel, while his final solo album of covers was 2021's At My Piano, in which he played a variety of the Beach Boys' songs on the instrument. He released a memoir in 2016, and the following year shared “Some Sweet Day,” a previously unreleased song recorded in the 1990s, as well as a new single called “Run James Run.”

Wilson and the Beach Boys were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Wilson won two Grammy awards (out of nine nominations), and the Beach Boys were honored in 2001 with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

Sabrina Carpenter has announced a new album. She'll follow last year's Short n' Sweet with Man's Best Friend on August 29. See the album cover below.

Carpenter released her new album's lead single, “Manchild,” last week. She co-wrote the song with frequent collaborators Jack Antonoff and Amy Allen.

While Short n' Sweet was Carpenter's sixth solo studio album (with her debut, Eyes Wide Open, arriving way back in 2015), it marked a true breakout moment for the Pennsylvania-born musician. The album housed the hit singles “Espresso” and “Please Please Please,” and became Carpenter's first full-length to summit the Billboard 200. She also earned her first six Grammy nominations, thanks to the album and its singles. Ultimately, Carpenter won the 2025 Grammy Awards for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Pop Solo Performance (for “Espresso”).

Carpenter recently performed at Primavera Sound Barcelona. After imminent shows in London and Chicago, she'll continue her Short N' Sweet Tour in the autumn. Support on the North American tour will come from Olivia Dean, Amber Mark, and Ravyn Lenae.

When Thom Wasluck was 13 years old, soon after his grandmother's sudden passing from a heart attack, he realized his grandfather was ready to die. Brokenhearted and facing a cancer diagnosis, his grandfather began making practical arrangements for his funeral, picking out a casket and refusing treatment for his illness. “At 13, that was the most impactful thing I'd seen,” he's said. “Probably still is.”

This period of watching his grandfather, who he remembers as the “hardest, toughest man [he's] ever known,” grapple with intense emotion stuck with Wasluck. He named his long-running musical project, Planning for Burial, after the experience, which also serves as a guiding ethos for the ashen intensity of his songs. Through gloomy, genre-blurring music that draws on bleary shoegaze, grayscale ambient, and virtually every strain of downcast, depressive metal, he confronts heavy emotions without succumbing to them. Building from the blown-out loner doom of early records like 2009's Leaving to the expansive, enveloping gestures of Below the House, Wasluck has elaborated his vision, but his thematic fixations have stayed consistent. He mulls over the worst life has to offer—grief, loss, addiction, mental illness. But although his music is heavy, it's never hopeless.

From the opening moments of It's Closeness, It's Easy—the first Planning for Burial full-length since 2017—the world weighs heavily on Wasluck's shoulders. Announced by a thunderous snare drum and snowblind tremolo picking, the record's first track, “You Think,” is cacophonous and unsettled, the noise and feedback parting only for Wasluck to offer mumbled meditations on the passage of time and some unsparing self-assessments: “Always a mess,” he grumbles. “Even when I'm not.” The record is littered with these cryptic moments of self-reflection and self-laceration. As he memorably mutters on “A Flowing Field of Green,” “No need to dig, everywhere is a hole,” a mantra for those who, like him, feel the burden of existence in everything they see.

But Wasluck never fully gives himself over to misery; in moments It's Closeness, It's Easy even begins to approach an uneasy optimism. “A Flowing Field of Green,” for all its melancholia, culminates in a conscious rejection of the call of the void. “Fresh Flowers for All Time,” despite its crushing instrumentation—reminiscent of the gothic, hard-edged shoegaze sound of Nothing or Cold Gawd—reads like a love song. Though the prickly guitar work nearly swallows his vocals, he sings a prayer of constancy and devotion that gives the record its title: “It's closeness, it's easy, and I wouldn't want anything more for all time.”

On It's Closeness, It's Easy, more than on Wasluck's past records, optimism and anxiety are braided together. On one song, he sings about grief and loss; on another he sings of domestic serenity. Blast beats and static give way to placid ambient interludes. Hope has always been implicit in Planning for Burial's records, as it is in all heavy music. The endurance to remember and describe the worst of what you're going through is itself proof of perseverance—even reluctantly pushing onward is pushing onward still. It's Closeness, It's Easy goes a step further, proving that if you push long enough, peace may find you, if just for a moment.

When John Fahey invented modern fingerstyle guitar as we know it, he created a paradox. His lonesome style of ghost-town music conjured a way of American life that never truly existed—a place in his mind where Delta blues, ragtime, bluegrass, and Indian raga all rose naturally from the ground. Ironically, by doing so, he ended up with a new, very real tradition: Generation after generation of artists have attempted to evoke his specific vision of the people who live on this land, fighting against the current of popular music as they chase his tumbleweed across the desert.

Perhaps even more so than the torchbearers that have inspired him, Hayden Pedigo has embraced the costume-like nature of this role. The Texas-bred fingerpicker has tended to shroud his soft, wilted music in a matrix of inside jokes and pranks. When he's not running for local office or walking for Gucci, he's making tongue-in-cheek instructional videos on how to play his songs, and posting ridiculous fit pics on his Instagram. He performs in brightly pigmented Western shirts and sky-high Stetsons, looking either the spitting image of Hank himself, or Woody from Toy Story depending how you squint. There's a long history of absurd costumes in the country world, from Gram Parsons' weed-covered Nudie suit to Robbie Basho's cowboy duds to Blaze Foley wrapping his clothes up in duct tape. Until now, Pedigo has indulged in this sense of playacting, dressing the part of the old-world troubadour even as he waxes about how inspiring the early-'10s blog days were and declares the ultimate ambient Americana record to be James Ferraro's gas-station reverie Last American Hero.

On I'll Be Waving as You Drive Away, Pedigo drops the smirk. Played with a powerful directness and dappled with rich arrangements, it's his most majestic album yet, though he doesn't accomplish it through epic, galloping melodies the way William Tyler might, nor through rugged textural exploration as Daniel Bachman would. Because Pedigo is concerned, above all, with the beauty in emptiness itself. “Even the flatness I love,” he's said of his hometown of Amarillo—a muse that he defends in interviews as if it were a frowned-upon lover. “It makes you breathe a little bit better when you feel like you can see that far.”

Pedigo's music, in turn, breathes. Building on the quiet, unflashy melancholy of 2021's Letting Go and 2023's The Happiest Times I Ever Ignored, his playing doesn't aim for the jaw-dropping splendor of the Grand Canyon, but the small pit stop towns on the drive up. Striking an airy grace halfway between ECM and Windham Hill, Pedigo and producer Scott Hirsch's arrangements are designed to create a sense of space. Piano notes trickle down the descending melody of “All the Way Across” like falling helicopter seeds, while vibraphone-like keys swirl around circular arpeggios on “Hermes,” dissolving the track into a liquid wash of color. Pedigo and Hirsch leave plenty of room for the little details to shine through, materializing as gradually as flecks of landscape passing in the window.

Written during an artist residency on a 20,000-acre ranch in Wyoming and recorded in the small, new-agey town of Ojai, Calif., these songs contain a newfound lushness, an O'Rourke-ian vibrancy that allows each instrument to express its particular tonalities to the fullest. “Long Pond Lily” commences the album on a warm, optimistic tone, decorating his autumnal riffs with phased-out electric hammer-ons beamed in straight from Up on the Sun, zipping up and down in playful jest. But the longer Pedigo plays, the more his songs descend into a misty daze. The reverbed opening notes of “Smoked” unveil a chasm of mellotron choirs that imbue Pedigo's fingerpicking with an otherworldly dread, as if the spirits haunting his strings were coming to life.

I'll Be Waving as You Drive Away takes its name from a particularly dark episode of Little House on the Prairie in which the family's eldest daughter loses her eyesight bit by bit, eventually going completely blind. For an artist whose sense of irony has always put his work at arm's length, Pedigo's latest underlines the tension between its tragedies and absurdities by playing it totally sincere. On the front porch lament of “Houndstooth,” Pedigo steadily slows his picking to clear the way for folksy brushes of fiddle, their melody tenderly caressing his guitar. They might summon images of Oklahoma!, or perhaps some lost John Ford film, though it's a little hard to put your finger on. It's a pastiche of something from long ago, or maybe something that never was. But there it is, beckoning you back.

There is a clarity to Ethiopian pianist Emahoy Tsege Mariam Gebru's music that transforms her skeletal playing into founts of emotion. It permeates every song on Éthiopiques 21, the 2006 compilation that highlighted solo piano music from four of her albums. “Mother's Love” ambles casually, frequently punctuated by circular, trilling melodies that echo the gentle and guiding hand of an attentive mother. “The Last Tears of a Deceased” traverses passages of varying turbulence, and its most emphatic moments sound like a sudden wave of tears arriving mid-reflection. These two songs, among others she composed, were dedicated to family members who passed away. It was apt that the CD began with “The Homeless Wanderer,” about a vagabond assuaging their worries through song.

Music always had this immediate, ineffable quality for Emahoy. After an arson attempt on her family home in Addis Ababa when she was 5, she was sent by her father—a political reformer and public intellectual—to live in Switzerland. It was there that she attended her first concert. Overcome with emotion, she approached the musician to share her gratitude; he encouraged her to play the piano, which she later took up and considered her “greatest friend” during adolescence. After Mussolini invaded Ethiopia in 1935, she and her family were taken to various locales throughout their home country and Italy, eventually landing at a monastery in Mercogliano. Emahoy played the organ there, singing hymns with nuns. Over the next several years, her religious fervor grew, and she became a nun herself at Ethiopia's Amba Geshen, a holy mountain said to host a fragment of the True Cross.

Emahoy's itinerant life and spirituality gave shape to a singular musical sensibility mixing the Western classical composers she loved (Beethoven, Chopin, Strauss) with the Ethiopian secular and sacred music that was around her. Mississippi Records' newest dispatch, Church of Kidane Mehret, stands out among their recent string of Emahoy reissues by focusing on her most explicitly religious batch of songs. It culls from two different LPs—the 1972 album of the same name, and 1963's Der Sang Des Meeres, which was the source for four songs on Éthiopiques—but it doesn't reach the ecstatic highs of her best-known music. Take the longest track, the 11-minute pipe-organ epic “Via Dolorosa, XIth Station of the Cross.” Its title refers to Jesus' crucifixion, but the drama that should be on display—of grief and hope, sorrow and glory—is nowhere to be found. Chords progress in a steady fashion, the dynamic range is limited, and every note congeals into a vague mush of sacrosanct verve.

Ultimately, the pipe organ isn't a potent instrument in Emahoy's hands. The melodic filigrees that characterize her work are largely absent from these pieces; those that do appear sound anonymous and inert in the middle of sustained reverberations. In the piano-based “The Garden of Gethesemanie,” which is named after the place where Jesus was betrayed, twisting melodies are suffused with sadness and solemnity, but there are sections—like when she slowly ascends chromatically—where the emotion turns fascinatingly ambiguous. Her solo piano works are musically naked, and the feelings they convey are complex; in contrast, “Via Dolorosa” is rife with sound but startlingly hollow. This is a more traditional song than we're accustomed to hearing from Emahoy; the 1972 LP, her first on a commercial record label, was positioned as a “contribution to the welfare of the Church.” (She didn't even feature on the A-side of the original LP, which was given over to field recordings of religious chant.)

“Prayer for Peace. Ps. 122 (Kyrie Eleison),” another staid pipe-organ piece, clarifies what is so jarring about this reissue. The spaciousness and grandiosity of these liturgical recordings preclude the sense of intimacy we have come to expect from Emahoy's more celebrated works. A song like “Tenkou! Why Feel Sorry?” is more capable of providing serenity. The solo piano version is quietly cheery, and the take that appeared on last year's tremendous Souvenirs was even more touching because of Emahoy's vocals. “Why those tears in your eyes? Cheer up, for you are so young,” she sang tenderly. It's the difference between reading a generic platitude and having a friend sit with you to talk through your troubles: There's greater intention, more direct communication.

The other two songs from the original Church LP aren't much better. “Ave Maria” is marred by shoddy recording quality, and the piano notes all smear together. Low fidelity isn't exactly the issue; there's a welcoming domesticity to a song like “Clouds Moving on the Sky,” and the high noise floor across Souvenirs only made the tracks seem more personal. “Ave Maria” is more about atmosphere, about a song's ghostly presence. One can imagine the thrill that could arise in passages where Emahoy plays higher notes, but all that exists in the recording is the promise of greater feeling. “Spring Ode – Meskere” also suffers, this time because Emahoy plays the harmonium. The song is repetitive to a fault, sounding less economical than her other works, and the instrument—while more affecting than the pipe organ—doesn't suit her less-is-more approach. It is hard to believe that Emahoy wanted some of her songs, like “The Jordan River Song,” to be played on harmonium or organ instead of the piano; she draws so much more meaning from the latter.

Thankfully, Church of Kidane Mehret is partly redeemed by the tracks taken from Der Sang Des Meeres. While short, “The Storm” and “Essay on Mahlet, The Prayer of Saint Yared” feature Emahoy playing the piano in typically arresting fashion. The former showcases both her love for Romantic-era composers and the way she differs from them. It's especially loose, in form and feel, which makes sense, given that she didn't put time signatures on her sheet music. “It depends on the day, on the mood, on the weather,” she once said of how to play her songs. The song recalls Zema, or Ethiopian liturgical chants, and the way their different modes don't always indicate pitch as they do in the West, but instead specify performance style. This emphasis on feeling sheds light on her practice. The four-minute “Essay” reduces the polyphonic free-verse chanting heard in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church into simple, exceedingly pretty melodies. Such comforting beauty is rare across Church of Kidane Mehret, but even hearing it in brief snatches is a reminder of Emahoy's brilliance: At her best, a few notes can cut to the core of any emotion.

Brian Wilson, who as leader of the Beach Boys and a founder of California rock invented a massively successful pop sound full of harmonies and sunshine, has died at the age of 82.


	“We are heartbroken to announce that our beloved father Brian Wilson has passed away. We are at a loss for words right now,” his family wrote in a statement posted on social media. “Please respect our privacy at this time as our family is grieving. We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world.”

A post shared by Brian Wilson (@brianwilsonlive)


	Wilson's family did not provide a cause of death, but it was revealed in February 2024 that the Beach Boys legend was battling dementia.


	“Brian gave so much to the world through his music, his spirit and his strength. He was a sweet, gentle soul as well as fierce competitor,” Wilson's longtime manager Jean Sievers said in a statement to Rolling Stone. “There will never ever be anyone like him again. God truly broke the mold when he created Brian Wilson. Besides being a creative genius, he was one the smartest and funniest people I've ever known. His message of love will live on through his music forever.”

	











	Wilson's legacy includes dozens of hit singles with the Beach Boys, including three Number One singles (“I Get Around,” “Help Me, Rhonda,” and “Good Vibrations”). In the 1960s, the Beach Boys were not only the most successful American band, but they also jockeyed for global preeminence with the Beatles. And on albums such as Pet Sounds, Wilson's lavish, orchestral production techniques dramatically expanded the sonic palette of rock & roll and showed how the recording studio could be an instrument by itself.

	Born June 20, 1942, Brian Wilson grew up in Hawthorne, California, a modest town next to the Los Angeles Airport. Brian was the eldest of three brothers; his younger brothers were Dennis and Carl. Their father, Murry, was an aspiring songwriter and a tyrant. “Although he saw himself as a loving father who guided his brood with a firm hand, he abused us psychologically and physically, creating wounds that never healed,” Wilson wrote in his 1991 autobiography, Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story.

	Wilson grew up playing sports and obsessing over music, teaching his brothers to harmonize with him. Music was his sustenance and his solace, he said: “Early on, I learned that when I tuned the world out, I was able to tune in a mysterious, God-given music. It was my gift, and it allowed me to interpret and understand emotions I couldn't articulate.”


	In 1961, Brian, Dennis, and Carl formed a band with their cousin Mike Love and their friend Al Jardine, managed by Murry Wilson; Brian played bass, took many of the lead vocals, and wrote the songs. Signed to Capitol Records and named the Beach Boys, they started to roll out hits like convertible Thunderbirds coming off an assembly line: “Surfin' U.S.A.” (with music borrowed from Chuck Berry's “Sweet Little Sixteen”), “Surfer Girl,” “Be True to Your School,” “Fun, Fun, Fun.” Those Brian Wilson compositions all sounded like insanely catchy jingles for the California teenage lifestyle — surfboards, hamburger stands, pep rallies — but on the flip side of the good times was a real sense of melancholy. Sometimes that was apparent in the lyrics — the lonesome “In My Room,” for example — and sometimes it was expressed nonverbally, with the Beach Boys' heartbreaking multipart harmonies.


	Wilson got more ambitious in his songwriting and experimented with new sounds—like the chunky surf guitar and falsetto lead on “I Get Around.” But he buckled under the stress of touring, having a nervous breakdown on the road in Europe in 1964. He decided that while the other Beach Boys toured the world, he would stay home and work on perfecting new material in the studio: When the band came back to California, they would step in and lay down their tracks. The results included gorgeous singles such as “California Girls” and the immortal 1966 album Pet Sounds.

	The album, which regularly ranks at or near the top of the best albums ever made (Rolling Stone named it Number Two in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time), was inspired by the Beatles' innovative work on Rubber Soul; in return, it inspired the Fab Four to new heights of experimentation on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Paul McCartney frequently cited Pet Sounds as a masterpiece, giving it particular credit for its innovative bass playing, and has called the aching “God Only Knows” his favorite song of all time. The album was orchestrated with instruments that included harpsichords, bicycle bells, and barking dogs. The culmination was “Wouldn't It Be Nice,” with its lyrics yearning for an adult life and love.

	











	The other Beach Boys, particularly Mike Love, were not impressed by Pet Sounds, and Wilson considered releasing it as a solo record; as a Beach Boys album, it was only a middling success in the States, although its influence was huge and it was recognized as an instant classic in the U.K. Wilson followed up with the Beach Boys' finest single, “Good Vibrations,” three-and-a-half thrilling minutes of electro-theremin and stacks of vocals, recorded over a period of six months in various studios at a cost that was reportedly, at that point, the most expensive single in history.


	Wilson returned to the studio with plans to top himself: an album called Smile, which he told friends would be a “teenage symphony to God.” Working with lyricist Van Dyke Parks, he started to assemble an elaborate collection of musical suites, intended to change the face of popular music, but the sessions fell apart, weighed down by the indifference of the other Beach Boys, Wilson's consumption of pot and LSD, and his growing mental instability. While recording “Mrs. O'Leary's Cow,” a piece of the “Elements” suite about fire, Wilson handed out plastic firemen's helmets to the orchestra and actually lit a fire in the studio to inspire them. When he found out that a building near the studio had burned down, he thought he had caused the fire through his music, freaked out, and locked the tapes in a vault.


	Wilson spent most of the next decade in his Bel Air mansion, which included both a recording studio and a sandbox in the living room (he put his piano in it so he could feel sand between his toes when he played). “He was a man so lonely and so abused and maligned, ostracized,” Van Dyke Parks told Rolling Stone in 2004. “It was an outrage what he suffered.”


	The Beach Boys continued without Brian Wilson; even as their album sales evaporated, they remained a popular oldies-oriented touring act. Over the following decades, Wilson would periodically rejoin the band and sometimes even tour with them, despite the intra-band lawsuits over songwriting credits and money. In 1988, Wilson hesitantly stepped back into the public eye and started releasing solo albums, beginning with the cult masterpiece Brian Wilson, which had a executive producer credit for Wilson's longtime therapist, Dr. Eugene Landy (who later had lost his license to practice therapy). It was outpaced commercially by Wilson's daughters, Carnie and Wendy, who formed two-thirds of Wilson Phillips, a vocal trio that sold ten million copies of their 1990 debut album. Wilson performed with his daughters on 1995's I Just Wasn't Made for These Times. That same year he released Orange Crate Art, an collaboration with Van Dyke Parks.

	











Smile‘s legend had only increased in the decades since it was abandoned; it was considered the great lost rock album and even inspired a time-travel novel (Lewis Shiner's Glimpses) where the protagonist convinces Wilson to complete the album. Although songs, including “Heroes and Villains” and “Surf's Up,” had made their way piecemeal onto Beach Boys albums, it was generally assumed that it was impossible to piece together the shards of Wilson's masterpiece. In 2004, however, against all odds, Wilson completed the album; in a five-star review, Rolling Stone said it was “beautiful and funny, goofily grand.”


	Wilson had found his way to something that once seemed impossible: a happy ending. “I'll tell you something I've learned,” he confided to Rolling Stone in 2004. “It's hard work to be happy.”

	In February 2024, just weeks after the death of Brian's second wife and longtime manager, Melinda, Brian's family revealed that the singer was suffering from dementia, and a conservatorship was sought to secure his continued care.


	“This decision was made to ensure that there will be no extreme changes to the household, and Brian and the children living at home will be taken care of and remain in the home where they are cared for,” the Wilson family statement said at the time. “Brian will be able to enjoy all of his family and friends and continue to work on current projects as well as participate in any activities he chooses.”

	Even before Donald Trump militarized his crackdown on pro-immigrant protesters in Los Angeles, a massive, nationwide demonstration was in the works for Saturday.


	The “No Kings” protests on June 14 have been imagined as a peaceful uprising to counter President Trump throwing himself a military parade on his birthday (which is also Flag Day and the 250th anniversary of the Army). Trump is organizing spectacle befitting a tin-pot tyrant, including a procession of tanks, Howitzers, mobile rocket launchers and other war machines rolling through the streets of Washington, D.C., as military aircraft, including Apache helicopters, soar overhead. 


Protest organizers have billed June 14 as a “nationwide day of defiance,” during which Americans across the country stand up to “reject authoritarianism” and reclaim patriotism in the name of democracy. “The flag doesn't belong to President Trump. It belongs to us,” the protest website declares. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Trump has menaced demonstrators planning to show up at his military procession: “If any protester wants to come out, they will be met with very big force,” he said Tuesday. Anticipating such a reaction, protest organizers specifically decided not to target the Trump parade route; there is not even a No Kings event planned in D.C. They envision, instead, demonstrators “showing up everywhere [Trump] isn't — to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.”

	











	Turnout at the nationwide demonstrations is expected to surpass the April 5 “Hands Off!” protests, which drew more than 3 million protesters to oppose the Trump government, then dominated by Elon Musk, who was imposing draconian cuts on federal services through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. 

	











	“We've been planning the No Kings day” for months, says Ezra Levin, a cofounder of the progressive grassroots giant Indivisible, which is a key partner in a protest coalition that includes grassroots groups like 50501, civil rights organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, and many labor and environmental groups. Outside of a few anchor events — a large event is planned in Philadelphia, for example — the No Kings protests are organized on a viral, distributed basis, with locals in each community calling the shots. By last week, the number of planned events had already surpassed the April total.

	Now that Trump has ordered troops into the streets of Los Angeles — to crack down on Americans exercising their First Amendment rights by protesting actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement — the reasons to demonstrate just got a lot more concrete. With the “egregious overreach” in Los Angeles “inflaming tensions,” Levin says, “suddenly all the numbers started skyrocketing.”


	The volatile situation in the Los Angeles area was provoked by ICE agents expanding arrests of community members at job sites, including at downtown garment factories and a Home Depot. Tensions were also inflamed by reports of ICE taking law-abiding individuals who showed up to mandatory check-ins with immigration officials into custody, and then locking them in the basement of a federal building.Speaking Monday with Rolling Stone, Levin described 1,800 planned No Kings events, roughly 500 more than the total for April. These include protests across America — from Nome, Alaska, to San Juan, Puerto Rico (map: here) — as well as solidarity actions around the globe. “I can guarantee you there will be millions of people out on No Kings day,” he says.


	The planning for the No Kings protest began when Trump started touting his “dictator-style birthday parade,” Levin recalls. “We didn't want to cede the narrative to him; we didn't want to allow him to portray himself as all-powerful.” The idea was to mass mobilize Americans of all walks of life — in big cities and small towns and rural communities — as a counter weight to Trump's authoritarian ambitions. (Trump's birthday bash is wildly unpopular; a new poll finds the military parade is opposed by three out of four Americans, including a majority of Republicans.)

	The federal escalation in Southern California is rocket fuel for the protest mission. “In the context of his escalation in L.A., it takes on greater import,” Levin says. “You need to have a visible demonstration that Americans are against authoritarian overreach.”


	Organizers want to turn out protesters who are ideologically diverse and geographically dispersed. “It needs to be everywhere, so that the contrast of what Trump is doing is as clear as possible,” says Levin, a former congressional staffer. “This guy stands for himself and his cronies. And the American people aren't going to stand for it.”

	











	The L.A. protests have been combustible, marked by clashes between demonstrators and the city's notoriously brutal cops and sheriff deputies, as well as with paramilitary forces from the Department of Homeland Security. The authorities have been launching tear-gas attacks and firing less-lethal projectiles into crowds, and agitators have been filmed throwing rocks and debris at law enforcement.


	Levin insists that No Kings will be a show of nonviolent resistance, adding that Trump's ugly show of force — including deploying National Guard troops and Marines in Los Angeles over the governor's objections — must be met with a combination of mass turnout and immaculate vibes. “When they crack down on peaceful protests, what you need is overwhelmingly large, peaceful protests. That's the way you respond to the authoritarian playbook.


	“We need nonviolence in the streets,” he continues. “The alternative is giving the authoritarian the excuse that he wants to crack down on yet more peaceful protesters outside of L.A.”

	With emotions running hot, that puts a special burden on protest organizers — most of whom are self-appointed volunteers. No Kings organizers are providing trainings this week for local protest marshals — emphasizing public safety and de-escalation. “We need to have everybody in the right mindset,” Levin says, explaining that the protests are a “strategic play to demonstrate exactly how outside the norm this administration is.” 


	Events this large can take on a life of their own. “Some people are going to join in because they heard it was the cool place to be,” Levin says. “It's incumbent on those who are more engaged to act as leaders and to operate under the umbrella of nonviolence, because the alternative is playing directly into Trump's hands.”

BTS members Jimin and Jungkook have completed their mandatory military service in South Korea. Tonight, Jungkook addressed fans as they completed their required time in service, just a day after RM and V were also discharged.


	“WE ARE BACK,” wrote Jungkook in an Instagram post alongside a photo of him and Jimin in uniform.

A post shared by Jungkook (@jungkook.97.official)


	Jin was the first to be discharged in June 2024. J-hope came out that October and told Rolling Stone that the time away was “invaluable.” He said, “The thoughts I had during those times have become an inseparable part of me, nurturing and shaping who I am today. Ultimately, they have influenced the stories I tell, the music I aspire to create.”


	Only Suga is left to be released later this month after completing his military service. Suga was assigned social service agent as an alternative to military service, which typically involves a shorter duration. He will be the last BTS member to return. (In South Korea, it is standard for men to begin a 21-month term by their 28th birthday.)

	Following her arrest last month for driving under the influence, four-time Olympic gold medalist Mary Lou Retton said she takes “full responsibility” for her actions.


	“What happened was completely unacceptable. I make no excuses,” she said in a statement to the Associated Press. “To my family, friends and my fans: I have let you down, and for that I am deeply sorry. I am determined to learn and grow from this experience, and I am committed to making positive changes in my life. I truly appreciate your concern, encouragement and continued support.”


	On Tuesday, Retton entered a no contest plea to driving under the influence stemming from the May incident and was fined $100, a standard for first-time, non-aggravated offenses, her attorney Edmund J. Rollo told the outlet. 


	Retton was arrested in West Virginia on May 17 after police in Fairmont pulled her over following a report of a person driving a Porsche erratically. According to a criminal complaint, the former athlete smelled of alcohol, was slurring her words, and failed a field sobriety test. Officers also allegedly saw a wine container in the passenger seat.

	Retton was charged with “driving under influence of alcohol, controlled substances, or drugs,” and released from custody after paying a $1,500 personal recognizance bond.

	At 16, Retton became the first American woman to win the all-around gold medal in gymnastics at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Retton has been retired for more than 30 years, having left after winning the American Cup all-around competition for the third time in 1985.

	











	In October 2023, the Dancing with the Stars alum was hospitalized in the ICU with a rare form of pneumonia. Retton previously detailed the severity of her illness in an interview with Today. “This is serious, and this is life, and I'm so grateful to be here. I am blessed to be here because there was a time when they were about to put me on life support,” Retton shared.

	Won't the real Pitbull please stand up? In recent months, fans of Mr. Worldwide have taken to donning bald caps, designer shades, and black suits — just like the 44-year-old rapper himself — while attending Pitbull concerts. Well, the Miami-born rapper has noticed the viral trend, especially on his U.K. and Ireland tour last week, and seeing the love makes him “very, very happy,” according to an interview he gave the BBC on Tuesday.


	“Every time I'm at a show, I let them know that when you put on a bald cap, I hope you're ready to have the time of your lives,” he said. “It feels deeper than just music.”


	People have cosplayed as their favorite artists in one form or another for more than half a century, getting moptop haircuts like the Beatles, sporting “Starchild” makeup at Kiss concerts, and wearing homemade masks to Slipknot shows. But few fan bases have gone the extra mile to put on bald caps, and Pitbull said he felt touched by seeing the special effort his fans put into their mimicry.

	“It's the ultimate trophy to be able to go on stage and see all the hard work that you put into the music,” he said. “I've been in the game for 25 years and to see every demographic, everybody [dressing up] at the shows is priceless.” (What's even more special, he said, is “people coming up to me and say ‘I learned Spanish due to your words.'”)


	Mr. 305 kicked off the tour at Ireland's 3Arena on June 5 for a two-night stand and crossed the Irish Sea to perform at arenas in Manchester and London. On Thursday, he's scheduled to perform in Paris.

Nancy Wilson‘s custom-made guitar, one of the two “irreplaceable” instruments that were stolen on the eve of Heart's tour, has been recovered, Atlantic City police announced Tuesday.


	A suspect in the theft was arrested last week, at which time authorities said they obtained surveillance footage of 57-year-old Garfield Bennett from Pleasantville, NJ, trying to sell various items he had allegedly stolen from the band on the eve of their Royal Flush summer tour on May 31.


	According to police, Bennett sold the purple Telecaster guitar made specifically for Wilson to another woman, who purchased it at a meet-up just blocks from the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino where the instruments were stolen, the Associated Press reports.


	Using automated license plate readers on the surveillance footage, police were able to identify the woman who purchased the guitar from Bennett; when contacted by police, she voluntarily returned the instrument.

	Wilson and Heart have not yet commented on the guitar's return. The band continues their Royal Flush tour Friday night in St. Louis, Missouri. Police added that the other stolen instrument, a vintage 1966 Gibson EM-50 mandolin played by band member Paul Moak for the past three decades, remains unaccounted for.

	“These instruments are more than just tools of our trade — they're extensions of our musical souls,” Nancy Wilson previously said in a statement after the instruments were first stolen. 


	“The baritone Tele was made uniquely for me, and Paul's mandolin has been with him for decades. We're heartbroken, and we're asking for their safe return—no questions asked. Their value to us is immeasurable.” She added, “We are deeply grateful to the Atlantic City Police Department, the Hard Rock organization, and everyone who came together to support us in the search for our stolen instruments. The outpouring of love and concern has been overwhelming, and we are truly touched by the strength and compassion of this community.”

Over the weekend, there were some very concerned citizens on the southwestern side of Daviess County, Kentucky. Motorists were stopped along Hwy 81 trying to figure out what in the holy X-Files they were looking at it. There appeared to be an unidentified, flying object hovering above them and no one (well, almost no one) knew what it was. For a brief moment, it looked like a case for Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully.

Now, the thought of aliens in Kentucky isn't new. There is a now legendary account that centers around an incident in Kelly, quite close to Hopkinsville, way back in 1955. It was August 21st of that year that Elmer 'Lucky' Sutton, his wife Vera, and their friend Billy Ray had a 'close encounter' with a flying saucer and a three-foot 'glowing' creature. That area of the state is now home to an annual event that commemorates that sighting. The event is the Kelly Little Green Men Days Festival.

Thankfully, there were no sightings of little green men in Daviess County over the weekend. There were only reports of what looked like a UFO. As it turns out, the object was very easily identified by Stuart Snow. He should know what it was because, well, he made it.

See, Stuart is a licensed professional fireworks and pyrotechnics expert. He was experimenting with some brand new special effects, particularly a gigantic fire and smoke ball. WATCH!

								A Journal of Analysis and News							



By Umair Khan 

The exchange of insults last week between Pakistan Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi was perhaps ordinary diplomatic sparring on the surface but more than quietly being an in-secret rebalancing of regional diplomacy. This dialogue is proof of a strategic re-think between Kabul and Islamabad on the connectivity of the region and shared economic interests. It is centered on the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) rail corridor project—a game-changing corridor that will redefine the economic and geopolitics of Central and South Asia.

The bilateral Pakistan-Afghanistan relationship has been war-, suspicion-, and security-narrative-oriented so far. Cross-border terrorism, the rise of the Taliban to power, and border-crossing refugees have all maintained a climate of suspicion of each other. But the decision to advance the relationship to the level of full ambassadorial relations itself suggests a clear attempt to move away from that old script. Both countries are eager to experiment with a more pragmatic relationship founded not on ideology or security but mutual strategic and economic interests. The UAP railroad is one actual platform for that change.

Envisioned initially in 2021, the rail link would connect the interior of resource-abundant Uzbekistan with Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar port cities via Afghanistan. It's a simple but persuasive idea: construct a fast, efficient, and inexpensive transportation route that reduces trade friction and opens up new economic opportunities for the three nations. To Central Asian landlocked nations, UAP line presents a worthy substitute for the conventional northward directions through Russia. To Pakistan, it restores its strategic worth as an entry to the Arabian Sea and crossing point between South and Central Asia.

This change of focus also aligns with a larger tendency in international politics, insofar as states increasingly seek cooperation based on converging economic interests, not ideological compatibility. The UAP project aligns with such thinking in promoting connectivity instead of confrontation. It does so in attempting to replicate a form of “functional institutionalism” for regional cooperation on infrastructure, trade, and logistics. Afghanistan, long perceived as instability and uncertainty, is instead being repackaged as not a hinderance but a transit necessity—central to the corridor's success, and regional stability more broadly.

The shift to increase diplomatic outreach isn't politic, however—it's a platform in pursuit of the long-term viability of the railway. When Foreign Minister Dar traveled to Kabul in April 2025, talks focused on outlining the parameters of UAP. The latest follow-up phone call is evidence of continuity of purpose, and this would suggest that both sides recognize long-term benefit in entrenching cooperation. These developments also coincide with growing regional investment interest from China in developing infrastructure, notably as part of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Although the UAP railway is not officially a BRI project, its strategic needs are extremely complementary to China's master plan of regional integration and therefore makes it even more geopolitically relevant.

But the path forward is fraught with difficulty. Albeit in words, assurances notwithstanding, Pakistan cannot be sure the Taliban-infested regime would be in a position to contain militancy, especially from groups such as the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Afghan security is volatile and sensitive to adversity, and it remains doubtful that long-term investment can be made in infrastructure. In addition, non-participation by India in this regional arrangement has strategic implications. While Islamabad, Kabul, and Tashkent converge towards each other, India risks being left behind in a growing connectivity matrix. As Turkiye and China have been developing deepening regional interests, Indian passive strategy can turn into isolation unless India reaffirms engagement with its neighbors in a positive way.

In these conditions, the UAP railway is more than a connectivity project—it's a power of regional transformation. It offers a forum on which economic realism can replace decades of political rigidity. The corridor does create a form of interdependency, however, that, if well managed, can cut across the political pendulum swings and ideology swings of its member states. It is no panacea for the pathologies of the region, but it is a start on the assumption that mutual prosperity can be a safer foundation for peace than mutual suspicion.

The manner in which the recent rounds of Afghan-Pakistan diplomatic negotiations are especially pressing is the nuance with which they introduce a shift towards both sides' postures. Instead of negotiating merely as an issue of security, the two nations appear to be grasping for the long-term dividends of economic membership. This is making way for more integrated diplomacy between both of them, an arena where infrastructure is crafted as a dialogue and stability tool and not necessarily development. The Muttaqi-Dar call might not have been watched in the world, but its effect is historical. It is a sign of a growing movement among regional players to opt for linkage instead of hostility. As the UAP railway project moves ever more rapidly ahead and new efforts at diplomatic normalisation are underway, a new day can be viewed to be on the horizon for Central and South Asia. A time when geography no longer means fate, but opportunity—when diplomacy flows not merely through embassies and communiqués, but through corridors linking countries, markets, and peoples together. If they are preserved, the UAP railway can also easily become a symbol of what regional cooperation can achieve in an increasingly dominated world by infrastructure and interdependence.

Carter Caves host cryptid hunt

By Charles Romans

Carter County Times

Patrons of Carter Caves State Park were treated to a special ‘hunt' last week as the park organized a search for everyone's favorite cryptid creature, Bigfoot. But why, Bigfoot? Because the legendary creature has actually been spotted inside the park, according to reports collected by event organizers and others.

“We've had several people come to us and say they have spotted Bigfoot on Box Canyon Trail,” event organizer Autumn Barnett said.

The idea for the hike was a joint effort of Barnett and Rachel McClurg, and was held on the same trail, giving patrons an opportunity to not only keep a watchful eye out for the reigning ‘hide-n-seek' champion, but also learn a little bit about the creature indigenous people named Tsul ‘Kalu, Yeaoh, and Sasquatch – among others. Barnett said the Bigfoot hunt was part of the park's efforts to come up with more creative things to inspire people to get out and visit one of the area's natural wonders.

“We knew a lot of people are really into Bigfoot, so we wanted to test it out,” Barnett said.

And the park passed the test with flying colors, seeing over 160 individuals and families turn out for the Tuesday night event. Barnett said they were surprised by the turnout, especially on a weeknight, but it was the best of surprises. The event saw local participants but also individuals and families from other parts of Kentucky, as well as West Virginia and Tennessee.

Barnett said that in the interest of attracting more people to the park, they have also been hosting similar paranormal events. For instance, Carter Caves is currently hosting a weekly Ghost and Legends Tour.

“We take people in by lantern light to Salt Peter Cave,” Barnett explained. “And we talk about local legends and ghost stories that revolve around that cave.”

The event is also an opportunity for people to share their own experiences, Barnett said.

“I have had scratches and rocks thrown at me in Salt Peter Cave,” she said, giving a personal example of a brush with the paranormal.

“We team up with a paranormal team out of Louisville called Serious Paranormal, and we have done two events with them,” Barnett continued. “They are absolutely great. We did a tour in Cascade Cave, and the one around Memorial Day at Salt Peter Cave.”

Barnett said that interest in the paranormal has proven popular in the area.

“We expected more people to be closed minded, but the exact opposite was true,” Barnett said. “Every event like this we have had has generated a lot of interest locally and throughout the region. And there are a lot of strange things that happen around the caves.”

The public isn't typically taken through most parts of the caves, she said, and it is difficult to really ‘know' what is happening in the unexplored regions.

“We are definitely going to be planning more paranormal expeditions with Serious Paranormal,” Barnett said. “We are going to try to investigate the Lodge and make the Salt Peter Cave investigation a yearly event.”

Barnett said for updates and upcoming events, patrons can visit the Carter Caves website and Facebook page.

Amanda Plummer from Flatwoods took part in the Bigfoot event with her family, and shared their impressions of the experience. Daughter Ellie said her favorite part of the experience was actually searching for Bigfoot and practicing her Bigfoot howl. Daughter Izzie didn't mention whether she had perfected her own Bigfoot howl, but said she enjoyed the hike with all the other people as they searched for the illusive cryptid.

Plummer herself said that she was impressed by the turnout and the wonderful job the staff at Carter Caves did putting on the event. She was also amazed by the amount of available Bigfoot t-shirts and bumper stickers. Husband Brennan Plummer said that being in the woods with his wife and children is always fun.

“My girls are really into legends right now, so this was an all-around fun experience,” he said. “And there were some Bigfoot enthusiasts there sharing their personal encounters,” he added, which made the experience even more enjoyable.

Among the more curious entries in alien lore, the tall whites stand out — literally.

These pale, lanky beings are said to be over 7 feet (2.1 meters) tall and were made famous by former military weather observer Charles James Hall, who detailed his alleged encounters during his time at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.

According to Hall, he was initially terrified but gradually overcame fears during his two years of working near them. In his writings, he describes walking with the tall beings and adapting to their presence through a mix of caution and curiosity.

The tall whites, as described by Hall, are allegedly humanoid aliens with long limbs, pale skin and glowing blue eyes.

Unlike the little green men of pop culture, they seem more reserved — aloof but not overtly hostile. Hall claimed they had a base on Earth and were here with the government's awareness, if not its full cooperation.

Their behavior was reportedly unpredictable. While some encounters were calm, others were stressful, especially early on when Hall was still claiming sightings without broader belief or support.

Hall's story gained attention in UFO circles and was later turned into a documentary film titled ""Walking With the Tall Whites"" based on his book series ""Millennial Hospitality."" Clips and videos online show interviews and reenactments, prompting viewers to start watching and debating what they watch.

Photos and evidence remain thin, and skeptics often point out the lack of physical proof. Still, descriptions from Hall and others have kept the story alive in UFO forums and niche media.

There's no definitive sign of an agenda. According to Hall, the tall whites seemed more interested in observing humans and exploring Earth than making contact. He even suggested they had families and a structured society.

Whether you believe the tale or not, the story taps into deeper questions about humanity, alien life and the nature of fear. From initial terror to cross-species curiosity, it's a narrative that challenges how we think about the unknown.

How can radio astronomers successfully identify extraterrestrial radio signals while discerning them from Earth-based radio signals? This is what a recent study published in The Astronomical Journal hopes to address as a team of researchers investigated how machine learning could be used to search for extraterrestrial technosignatures while simultaneously identifying radio contamination from human radio signals.

This study has the potential to help radio astronomers develop more efficient methods in searching for and identifying radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations.

The study was led by Snir Pardo from the School of Physics and Astronomy at Tel-Aviv University in Israel, whose team collaborated with the Breakthrough Listen project to obtain spectrograms from more than 300 stars less than 50 parsecs (163 light-years) from Earth. Spectrograms are data graphs that display the time and frequency of radio signals and are a common method in radio astronomy, with the researchers using the Parkes Observatory and Green Bank Observatory located in Australia and West Virginia, U.S., respectively, that are managed by the Breakthrough Listen project.

What makes this study unique is the researchers used a combination of computer models and machine learning algorithms to analyze the data with the goal of identifying candidate signals that could originate from an extraterrestrial technosignature and not from a human source radio signal.

The study notes, ""SETI [Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence] exemplifies the challenge of identifying new phenomena in vast, noisy data sets. We leveraged a minimal set of assumptions and simple operations, in order to search efficiently for technosignatures in radio observations of nearby stars.

""Of the 1,011 spectrograms of more than 300 nearby stars that we analyzed, we visually inspected about 20,000 of the most promising candidates and ruled them all out. Future work should explore incorporating adaptive multiscale techniques to further automate the vetting process and expand search efficiency.""

The Breakthrough Listen project is an astronomy project whose goal is to identify technosignatures of radio and laser communications using the aforementioned Parkes Observatory and Green Bank Observatory while being based at the Berkeley SETI Research Center. It was founded in 2016 and has surveyed more than 1 million stars, including all 43 stars located within 5 parsecs (16.3 light-years) from Earth.

While no confirmed technosignatures have yet to be received by scientists on Earth, the closest humanity has come to receiving a signal from another world happened August 15, 1977. This was when a 72-second signal was received by the Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope but went unknown for several days until astronomer Jerry R. Ehman evaluated the data and discovered the radio signal was so intense that he circled the data and wrote ""Wow!"" next to it.

Despite several attempts to obtain a similar signal from its supposed origin of the constellation Sagittarius, astronomers couldn't find another signal like it and have yet to receive anything close to the intensity of this original signal.

This study demonstrates how the SETI Institute continues to broaden its methods for using radio astronomy in searching for and identifying radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations, noted as technosignatures here.

Aside from using radio astronomy to search for technosignatures, the goal of SETI is to broaden our understanding of searching for life beyond Earth through collaborations on active and retired space missions, including Cassini, New Horizons, Opportunity, Curiosity, Kepler, and TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite).

As machine learning continues to advance, so will its ability to potentially identify technosignatures from outside Earth and demonstrate that we might not be alone in the universe.

While time ticks on at a steady pace, it doesn't always feel that way.

Ask most people getting older, and they'll tell you, time feels like it's speeding up as you gradually run out of it. The endless summers of childhood, once dragging on forever, now seem to pass in a blink. And the years? They just don't last as long as they used to.

So why does this happen? Several theories attempt to explain the phenomenon. One of the leading ideas has to do with how much new information we take in as time passes.

In a series of experiments in the 1960s outlined in his book On the Experience of Time, psychologist Robert Ornstein showed how perception of time can be shaped by how much new information our minds process. 

In one experiment, he showed volunteers diagrams of varying degrees of interest, before asking them to estimate how much time had elapsed. Though the diagrams were displayed to the subjects for the same amount of time, the subjects reported that diagrams with more interesting designs were displayed for longer than the less interesting designs. 

In a separate experiment, subjects were asked to listen to audio with varying amounts of information on them, in the form of clicking sounds and household noises, before they were again asked to estimate the amount of time they were listening to it. Where there was more information – for instance, if there were a lot more clicking noises – the subjects reported the task as having lasted longer.

So why does this lead to time seeming to slow down as we age?

""The theory goes that the older we get, the more familiar we become with our surroundings. We don't notice the detailed environments of our homes and workplaces,"" Dr Christian Yates, a senior lecturer in mathematical biology at the University of Bath, explained in a piece for The Conversation.

Everything is new to children, however. Think of how excited they are about getting on a train and seeing the sights around them, versus how little attention you pay on your commute.



""This means children must dedicate significantly more brain power re-configuring their mental ideas of the outside world,"" Yates adds. ""The theory suggests that this appears to make time run more slowly for children than for adults stuck in a routine.""

A similar idea, outlined in a 2019 paper, puts the blame on how quickly our minds process images as we age. 

""People are often amazed at how much they remember from days that seemed to last forever in their youth,"" Adrian Bejan, the J.A. Jones Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Duke, explained in a statement. ""It's not that their experiences were much deeper or more meaningful, it's just that they were being processed in rapid fire.""

As nerves and neurons age and become more complex, it takes longer for signals to take their paths than it does when you are young.

""The human mind senses time changing when the perceived images change,"" Bejan added. ""The present is different from the past because the mental viewing has changed, not because somebody's clock rings. Days seemed to last longer in your youth because the young mind receives more images during one day than the same mind in old age.""

Another idea is that a period of time (e.g. a month) seems shorter as we have experienced more time to compare it to.

""Proportional theory makes intuitive sense if we consider how a year in the lifespan of someone who is 75 years old may feel much quicker, for instance, in comparison to a year in the life of a ten-year-old,"" neuroscience researchers Muireann Irish and Claire O'Callaghan explain in a piece for The Conversation. 

""Memory may hold the key to time perception, as the clarity of our memories is believed to mould our experience of time. We mentally reflect on our past and use historic events to achieve a sense of our self existing across time.""

While the phenomenon is still being investigated by various teams, there is a suggestion that our perception of time is altered by the amount of new and interesting experiences we have as we grow older. Try to have as many as you can, before it's too late.

Local cop Melanie Scrofano gets a big scare while examining a dead body in a new Collider-exclusive sneak peek from the first episode of Revival. In addition to the dead rising from their graves in the new horror series, she's also dealing with a mysterious murder. It's a reunion between SyFy and Scrofano, who starred in the supernatural action series Wynonna Earp on the network for four seasons. Revival will premiere on SyFy on Thursday, June 12, at 10 p.m. ET; it will stream on Peacock next week.

It's an icy night in the Wisconsin woods when small-town cop Dana Cypress (Scrofano) stops to investigate a dead animal by the side of the road. It shows no sign of life...but she gets the scare of her life when local fitness enthusiast Lester (Peter Millard) pops up behind her. He almost gives her a heart attack, but the Jack LaLanne-styled Lester thinks one could be in her future anyway unless she cuts out the trans fats. Further investigation turns up a dead fox in a trap...and what appears to be several human teeth. Is there a killer on the loose...and if there is, are they among the living, or the undead? You'll have to tune in to Revival on SyFy tomorrow night to find out.

Dead bodies will be the least of Dana's problems in Revival, which is adapted from the Image Comics series of the same name by Tim Seely and Mike Norton. On one snowy day in Wausau, Wisconsin, the recently deceased suddenly cease to be deceased. The event becomes known as ""Revival Day"" and attracts national attention; meanwhile, Dana is busy tracking down a murderer. This is not a zombie series, however; the dead simply return to life, with no hunger for the brains of the living. In addition to Scrofano, the series also stars Romy Weltman (The Pradeeps of Pittsburgh) as Dana's daughter, Em; David James Elliott (JAG) as her father, Wayne; and Andy McQueen (Mrs. Davis) as Ibrahim Ramin. It also features recurring roles for Steven Ogg (The Walking Dead), Gia Sandhu (The Mysterious Benedict Society), Katherine King So (The Voyeurs), Maia Jae (Rabbit Hole), Nathan Dales (Letterkenny), Mark Little (Mr. D), Glen Gould (Tulsa King), Lara Jean Chorostecki (Hannibal), Conrad Coates (Fargo), and pro wrestler Phil ""CM Punk"" Brooks.

Canadian actor Scrofano is best known for starring in the title role of SyFy's Wynonna Earp, which concluded with the Tubi-original special Wynonna Earp: Vengeance last year. She also starred on Letterkenny as gin-and-tonic enthusiast Mrs. McMurray, and will return as Captain Marie Batel on the upcoming third season of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.

Revival will premiere on SyFy on Thursday, June 12, at 10 p.m. ET, and will stream on Peacock next week. Stay tuned to Collider for future updates.

Over the weekend, there were some very concerned citizens on the southwestern side of Daviess County, Kentucky. Motorists were stopped along Hwy 81 trying to figure out what in the holy X-Files they were looking at it. There appeared to be an unidentified, flying object hovering above them and no one (well, almost no one) knew what it was. For a brief moment, it looked like a case for Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully.

Now, the thought of aliens in Kentucky isn't new. There is a now legendary account that centers around an incident in Kelly, quite close to Hopkinsville, way back in 1955. It was August 21st of that year that Elmer 'Lucky' Sutton, his wife Vera, and their friend Billy Ray had a 'close encounter' with a flying saucer and a three-foot 'glowing' creature. That area of the state is now home to an annual event that commemorates that sighting. The event is the Kelly Little Green Men Days Festival.

Thankfully, there were no sightings of little green men in Daviess County over the weekend. There were only reports of what looked like a UFO. As it turns out, the object was very easily identified by Stuart Snow. He should know what it was because, well, he made it.

See, Stuart is a licensed professional fireworks and pyrotechnics expert. He was experimenting with some brand new special effects, particularly a gigantic fire and smoke ball. WATCH!

THR goes inside a book launch party for Day's latest book, ‘The Prism,' hosted by Kevin Huvane and Oscar nominee Demi Moore at the home of the CAA power player on a recent May evening.


							By 

	Chris Gardner



Kevin Huvane, one of Hollywood's most powerful and respected agents, happened to be in New York City about 32 years ago with client and friend Demi Moore when the movie star suggested an introduction to someone “really, really special” in her life. 


	The first name that came to Huvane's mind was the man most closely associated with Moore at the time, Bruce Willis. Nope, not him. “You had already had Rumer and I met her already,” Huvane recalled, referencing the eldest of Moore's three daughters with ex-husband Willis. Turns out it wasn't a relative, a fellow movie star or even an auteur. Over dinner at Nobu in New York, Moore introduced Huvane to that special someone, whom she described has having the credentials of an impressive multi-hyphenate: “a friend, a guidance counselor, a psychiatrist, a therapist and a healer.”

	“I fell in love with Laura Day that night,” Huvane said on a recent May evening while holding a microphone and standing next to Day and Moore on the back patio of his stunning Beverly Hills property with sweeping views of the entire city of Los Angeles. “From that moment on, she became part of our trio.”

	That three had good reason to reunite that night because in addition to her aforementioned titles, Day is also a New York Times best-selling author. Huvane opened his home to celebrate the publication of her latest tome titled The Prism: Seven Steps to Heal Your Past and Transform Your Future. Published by Spiegel & Grau, the book follows her other efforts Practical Intuition, Practical Intuition in Love, Practical Intuition for Success, The Circle, Welcome to Your Crisis and How to Rule the World From Your Couch. The Prism, described as part memoir and part self-help guide to overhauling one's life, is dedicated to “the four corners of my reality” including her writer-producer husband Stephen Schiff (The Americans), “son and sun” Samson Day, “exegete” Herschel Goldfield and Huvane, whom she dubbed “my rock.”

	











	He should also be credited for having the wittiest one-liner of the night. During his brief introduction, Huvane noted how Day wanted to write a book and Moore helped push it along, even suggesting that she promote it on Oprah Winfrey's beloved daytime talk show. The anecdote caused Day to interject, “You stole my story.” Without missing a beat, Huvane quipped, “You should have known that.” The crowd — filled with actors (Lucy Hale, Jurnee Smollett), comedians (Tig Notaro, Jack Whitehall), power players (Greg Berlanti, Robbie Rogers), agents (CAA's Tracy Brennan, Jaime Feld, Ryan Abboushi), Housewives (Kyle Richards, Erika Jayne) and authors (Gregg Hurwitz) — ate it up. 


	Despite joking about Day's ability to see the future, Huvane did say he hates the word psychic and much prefers intuitive. “The Prism is one of those things where you read this book, work it and it will change your life,” he praised. “Laura fully believes we have this in all of us, and that if you take care of it and you nurture it, you can use it and it's going to help your life.” 


	With that, Huvane handed the microphone over to Moore who then detailed just how close she's been to Day over the decades. “Laura is one of if not my oldest friend. We've known each other at this point, I think 37 or 38 years,” said the best actress Oscar nominee for The Substance. “Laura has been given and was born with an incredible gift. But what's different about Laura than others who may share in similar gifts is that she has taken the time to hone her gift — to find a way to take what she was naturally given and make it targeted and precise and utilize that for her day job with Fortune 500 companies.”

	











	Moore said Day passes that knowledge along in The Prism and she suggested that the guests at the party pick up a copy on their way home and find a small cluster of friends to workshop the book together “to share in an experience and work together truly in community” to transform “to even higher and greater states.” 


	It was a quite an endorsement from Moore, who looked glowing and relaxed at the celebration as it was filled with friends and fellow industry insiders. She and Huvane then looked on with wide smiles as Day took the microphone and read prepared remarks that began with another sidestep around the term psychic. 


	“I call myself a practicing intuitive,” Day explained. “But that's really just a polite name for a psychic. It takes a lot of courage to say, ‘This weirdo is one of my people,' so a blanket thank you to all of you who have done just that by being here tonight.”


	She then credited a group of researchers for helping firm up what would one day become her livelihood. “I didn't know over 40 years ago when I stumbled into a group of researchers who were interested in extrasensory perception that my unhealthy neurology — the brain that refused to remember the periodic table or what year it was but could travel around in space and time — would become my career. What made me weird and unpopular in the third grade has brought me all of you, and lucky me.”

	











	Day, who overcame tragedy after the respective suicides of her mother, brother and sister, did not reveal her client list or how much she charges for her services (though several at the party whispered that her hourly rate is in the range of $10,000). But what she did say is that she specializes in what she calls data points. “People ask me everything, and I don't say, you should do this or you shouldn't do this. I give pieces of data,” she told THR. “I might tell an actor, ‘I feel like your co-star may drop out in May, and I have a feeling that this isn't the first time it's happened.' Since I don't know who the co-star is, they can check it out and see if I'm right about that. But I really only work for people who know what they're doing anyway — A VC firm, producers, studios, people who know what they're doing. They use me to find out things that happen out of the blue that they couldn't have expected or just to verify that they're going in the right direction or that their calculations are correct.” 


	Those services may be pricey but The Prism is not, both the book and the practice it preaches. 


	“Intuition is a part of all of my books, but my intuition has led me to the crucial need to work on the architecture of self. I use the prism as a metaphor for our structure, the way that we take the energy we all share, refract it through our human structure or what we call the ego, to create our world. But ego has gotten at rap. If I called my book The Ego, well, no one wants to come to a party celebrating that, but you need an ego. The ego is everything that begins with ‘I.' I love. I want. I build. I create. I hold. When you heal your ego — your prism — you heal your business, your relationships and your life.” Even in Hollywood.

Barron Trump, the youngest son of U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, is reportedly in a relationship with a fellow NYU student — but you wouldn't know it from the viral rumors flooding social media. While the 19-year-old keeps a low profile at college and is said to be happily dating someone who shares his love for privacy, the internet has spun an entirely different story.

From a bizarre viral video claiming he is “secretly married” to WNBA superstar Caitlin Clark, to an AI-generated deepfake linking him romantically with Spanish royal Princess Leonor, Barron has become unexpected tabloid bait. Yet, sources close to the NYU student insist the truth is far more grounded and far more private. “Barron has a really nice girlfriend and hangs out with her a lot,” an insider told NewsNation, noting that the relationship appears serious and intentionally kept under wraps.

Despite having secret service agents nearby at all times, Barron has managed to carve out a modest social life, including dating. “He can have a girlfriend — the Secret Service knows how to manage that,” a political source told PEOPLE. “Anyone who says otherwise doesn't understand how this works.” While it may not be ideal for a teenager looking for normalcy, insiders insist that Barron's relationship has not been hindered.

Though he has been previously speculated to have dated TikToker @maddatitude, that rumor was largely debunked — she never applied to NYU, and her social media-forward lifestyle doesn't align with Barron's extremely private nature. “He's not trying to be the big man on campus,” said a fellow NYU student, adding that Barron is far more like his mother than his headline-grabbing father.

Most NYU students appear to respect Barron's space. When his enrollment was first reported, reactions were mostly supportive. “He didn't choose this life,” one student told the Daily Mail. “His dad is his dad, and he's his own person.” Kaya Walker, former NYU College Republicans president, added that Barron is largely apolitical and stays under the radar — attending classes and heading straight home afterward. Even though AI fantasies and fabricated marriage theories continue to swirl online, the real Barron Trump seems focused on something far more relatable: building a quiet, meaningful connection — and trying to live a normal college life, one that's anything but ordinary when you're a Trump.","{'href': 'https://www.financialexpress.com', 'title': 'financialexpress.com'}","other"

This story is a Media Miss by the right as only 14% is from right-leaning media.

Leland Lehrman was named executive director last month of the MAHA Institute, an advocacy group advancing Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s priorities. Lehrman's appointment comes despite his extensive history of endorsing antisemitic fabrications, including a notorious false document that claims to reveal a secret Jewish plot, as well as advancing conspiracy theories that Israel's intelligence agency was responsible for the 9/11 attacks.

The MAHA Institute, originating as a pro-Kennedy Super PAC, opposes vaccines and spreads COVID-19 conspiracies, with Lehrman leveraging insider knowledge of Kennedy's vaccine policies. Lehrman claimed that the protocols are likely genuine and characterized them as the most comprehensive exposure of Jewish supremacist ideology, suggesting they would trigger a significant political and historical realization.

A recent analysis by a social justice watchdog group specializing in monitoring extremist and far-right activities exposes Lehrman's radical beliefs and indicates that his position at MAHA signals the movement's acceptance of antisemitic conspiracy narratives.

A new species of dinosaur that was probably a princely ancestor of T. rex, the king of the dinosaurs, has been identified from fossils excavated in Mongolia.

Scientists have identified a never-before-seen species of dinosaur called the dragon prince — a prehistoric predator that set tyrannosaurs on the path to ruling Earth. This newly discovered relative of Tyrannosaurus rex came to light after researchers re-examined fossils found in Mongolia.

Its existence sheds light on the story of tyrannosaur dinosaurs and how they evolved and spread.

The scientists named the dinosaur the dragon prince of Mongolia (Khankhuuluu mongoliensis), with the genus name based on the Latinization of the Mongolian words for prince and dragon. Their findings were published Wednesday (June 11) in the journal Nature.

""They [tyrannosauroids] were the princes before they took the mantle of kingship,"" study co-author Jared Voris, a researcher at the University of Calgary in Canada, told Live Science.

Tyrannosauroids were giant apex predators that walked on two legs, had huge heads with sharp teeth and tiny arms. They are part of the larger tyrannosauroid family and were thought to have evolved from smaller species — but until now there has been little fossil evidence to support this idea.

So, Voris set out for Mongolia to examine partial tyrannosauroid skeletons that had been excavated decades ago but not yet fully examined.

""Many of us in the palaeontology community knew that these Mongolian fossils were lurking in museum drawers, waiting to be studied properly, and apt to tell their own important part of the tyrannosaur story,"" Steve Brusatte, a palaeontologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Edinburgh, U.K., who wasn't involved in the research, told Live Science.

The specimens that really caught Voris' eye were found in Mongolia in 1972 and 1973 and described in a scientific paper in 1977, when the individuals were identified as the already known genus Alectrosaurus.

But after being reexamined, ""I realized it was something completely different than anything we'd ever seen,"" Voris said. ""And it actually represented the ancestor of all of our big apex predatory tyrannosaurs that we find both here in Alberta and in Mongolia and China.""



The dragon prince lived 86 million years ago and looked much like a tyrannosaur, but it was only about 13 feet (4 meters) long, weighing in at 1,650 pounds (750 kilograms). Many later tyrannosaurs were much bigger, with T. rex reaching 41 feet (12.5 m) long and weighing up to about 23,000 pounds (10,400 kg). The dragon prince also had a smaller head and longer arms compared to later tyrannosaurs.

""It's a nice new discovery giving us a better sense of what this intermediate phase of tyrannosaur history is like,"" Thomas Holtz, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland, who wasn't part of the team, told Live Science.

Voris thinks the specimens are small adult individuals, rather than young dinosaurs. He identified a slew of features that are indicators of maturity, including fused-up vertebrae, prominently developed small horns and the nasal bone having a wrinkled texture. ""The size is representative of the actual species rather than it being a younger animal,"" Voris said.

However, until a cross-section of the bones is done to look at growth rings, which hasn't yet been permitted because of the rare status of the fossils, we can't be sure of this adult status, Holtz said.

Unlike later tyrannosaurs, K. mongoliensis probably didn't hunt sauropods, the huge herbivorous dinosaurs with the long necks and long tails, said study co-author Darla Zelenitsky, a paleontologist at the University of Calgary. ""It was probably taking down prey smaller than itself,"" Zelenitsky told Live Science.

The finding suggests that tyrannosauroids were still small at the time, and only later became giants.

""What makes the specimens so important is their age. They are about 86 million years old, a good 20 million years older than T. rex,"" Brusatte said. ""It shows that tyrannosaurs were still relatively small at this time, and only later did they become colossal.""

The researchers also compared 12 species of tyrannosaurs to figure out when and where they lived, how they were related, and when any migrations might have taken place.

They found that, about 85 million years ago, K. mongoliensis, or a closely related species, migrated out of Asia into North America across a land bridge where the Bering Strait is now and gave rise to the first true tyrannosaurs. These went on to be the dominant predators in North America in the latter part of the Cretaceous period between about 85 million and 66 million years ago.

But about 78 million years ago, a tyrannosaur migrated back across the land bridge, resulting in their first appearance in Asia.

This resulted in the evolution of two tyrannosaur subgroups in Asia: huge ones weighing several tons like Tarbosaurus bataar, and smaller, slim ones such as Qianzhousaurus sinensis, which was nicknamed ""Pinocchio rex"" because of its small size and long snout.

During a third migration, about 68 million years ago, one of the giant tyrannosaur species from Asia traveled back to North America and probably gave rise to T. rex, Zelenitsky said.

""They show that a few big migration events back and forth between Asia and North America were the drivers of much of tyrannosaur evolution,"" Brusatte said. ""The tyrannosaur family tree was shaped by migration, just like so many of our human families.""

In 1965, the 33-year-old junior Senator from Massachusetts, Edward “Ted” Kennedy, took the floor to deliver his remarks on a bill that promised the American people little change: 


This statement—unimaginable from any Democrat today—summarized both Kennedy's own thinking and his party's main argument in support of the most liberal immigration bill ever enacted in the history of the world—the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. It was passed by a New Deal congress and signed into law by a New Deal president whose positions on union organization, healthcare, antitrust, and virtually every other economic issue are to the left of today's Democratic Party, but whose opinions on immigration would be considered right wing and racist by modern progressive standards.2

What President Johnson proclaimed as “not a revolutionary bill”3 on the day of its signing, over the coming decades completely transformed this country's demographic fabric, economic identity, and cultural psyche in ways that neither Kennedy, Johnson, nor those opposed to the 1965 bill foresaw. The American immigration system they created remains fundamentally unchanged and is unlike any other in both design and consequence. Distinct from most other developed nations that prioritize skilled workers and use points-based systems to meet labor market demands, (i.e., the more skilled and well-educated the prospective immigrant, and the higher their job offer is, the more likely they are to be admitted) the United States emphasizes family reunification, granting two-thirds of green cards to relatives of citizens or permanent residents. It also offers birthright citizenship, a policy shared by only a handful of countries, and a Diversity Visa Lottery that annually grants permanent residency to 55,000 randomly selected immigrants from underrepresented nations—programs that would be unthinkable in most European systems.4 The H-1B visa program, intended to bring in foreign workers for specialty occupations, also operates as a lottery system rather than the more common points-based system favored by other countries. This means that even if an employer wants to hire a specific, highly skilled worker, that candidate can only be hired if they win an annual lottery—competing against all other applicants in the same visa category. Their chances aren't high—the number of H-1B visas granted is limited by a congressionally mandated annual cap of just 65,000. In 2024, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services received 758,994 H-1B visa applications. The sheer scale of the U.S. system—with desired quotas that exceed those of every other nation5, 6, 7—also sets it apart, making it the most expansive and complex immigration system in existence.

The United States is currently home to one fifth of the world's immigrant population.8 It draws people from virtually every country on Earth,9 recording over a million10 legal entries and estimating close to two and a half million illegal entries every year.11 This unprecedented influx has warped the national conversation into one that also fails to find a precedent. Never before has immigration polled as both the most important and polarizing political issue,12 often framing itself as binary, with individuals and politicians declaring themselves as either pro- or anti-immigration. Historically, the debate has centered around more nuanced questions of who, how many, and under what conditions.

In America today, the single greatest divide between Democrats and Republicans is education. In the most recent election, Donald Trump won the White non-college educated vote two to one.13 This matters because the same moral frameworks that divide college and non-college educated Americans also drive views on immigration.

Psychologists have identified five core human values: care, fairness, sanctity, authority, and loyalty. Across the globe, college-educated professionals consistently rank two of these above the rest—care for others, especially the vulnerable, and fairness—placing them at the heart of their worldview and moral calculus. While working-class individuals also prioritize care and fairness, these values don't dominate their framework in the same way. Instead, they are weighted alongside values that matter little to the educated class—appreciation of tradition, respect for authority, and loyalty to family and community.14 It is a divide many researchers have described as the split between “universalists” and “communalists.”

At its core, today's immigration debate is a microcosm of the broader conflict between universalist and communalist ideals. For communalists, a country should restrict entry and prioritize its own people. For universalists, patriotic loyalties are dangerous and immigration is seen as a solution for closing the gap between rich and poor nations. Polls indicate that liberals tend to be universalists who support more open-door policies while conservatives tend to be communalists who favor policies that limit the number of immigrant arrivals.15

In the past, however, the immigration debate has not split so neatly across these lines. For most of American history, communalist views were not tied to conservatism. Indeed many 20th century communalists were progressives who rooted ideas of fairness and equality in the local or national community rather than seeing the issues as global causes. A. Philip Randolph—perhaps second to only Martin Luther King Jr., as America's most prominent Black civil rights leader—for example, called for:

The conservative intellectual giant and universalist Milton Friedman, meanwhile, positioned himself firmly on the other side of the debate as a strong advocate for higher levels of immigration.17

Since 1965, however, the views of both conservatives and liberals have converged on a pro-immigration platform. The Democrats transformed themselves into a college-educated party of social and cultural elites whose universalist worldview prioritizes human rights over American rights, while at the same time Republicans remained loyal to big business and free-market philosophies that also see benefits in a higher share of immigrant labor. According to an analysis of the Congressional Record, Democrats now speak more positively about immigration than any party has at any time in our nation's history.18 And until Trump's takeover of the Republican party in 2016, the right by and large agreed. It was, after all, President George W. Bush who tried to pass a bill establishing an easier pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.19

My own research on immigration suggests that much of the backlash to decades of record-breaking immigration with little pushback from politicians in either party resulted in the surge of populist candidates on both the right with Donald Trump and on the left with Bernie Sanders.20 During the 2016 presidential campaign, both Trump and Sanders broke with their parties on the issue of immigration, with Bernie in 2015 criticizing open border policies as “right-wing proposal[s]” that “[make] people in this country more poor than they already are,”21 and Trump infamously stating that “they [illegal immigrants] are bringing drugs, they're bringing crime” in his presidential announcement speech.22

A decade later, in 2025, Donald Trump's first bill signed as president was the Laken Riley Act, making it the first piece of legislation passed on the issue of immigration in over 20 years.23 Republican backers of the new legislation hope it is the first in a series of laws that remake our immigration system for the first time since 1965. Trump has already signed executive orders to end birthright citizenship, expand expedited removals, and ban asylum claims as part of his “deport them all” agenda.24 Meanwhile, Democrats appear to have hired John Lennon as their chief immigration strategist, drafting policy straight from the lyrics of Imagine, where “there's no countries” and with “all the people sharing all the world.” During the 2020 Democratic primary, Cory Booker promised to “virtually eliminate immigration detention” and fellow candidate Julian Castro unveiled a proposal to decriminalize illegal immigration and eliminate the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.25 Admittedly, Democrats have recently been forced by public opinion to back off many of these proposals, yet they remain unable to offer a coherent immigration policy beyond vague rhetoric. Who knows how this will all shake out, but here are some things that should be considered:

There are over 100,000 peer-reviewed articles on immigration. Its inconsistent effects, unintended costs, and contradictory benefits make it one of the most complex topics for social scientists and policy makers to understand. If you are looking for an answer as to whether immigration is good or bad, stop reading now. This is not to say that there are no answers or that nothing is known, but what it does mean is that what follows is unlikely to satisfy any one side of the political debate or provide a definitive blueprint for how to fix our broken system.

The economic effects of immigration are as varied as the immigrants themselves. Research suggests that immigrants who speak better English,26, 27, 28 stay married longer,29 are more willing to relocate within the U.S.,30 and who have less immediate family in the countries from which they came,31, 32 contribute more and cost less. Conversely, those who are excessively obese,33 choose to settle in rural neighborhoods,34 are worse at making friends,35 and who avoid paying taxes36 contribute less and cost more. Most immigrants, however, straddle both sides of the ledger—offering a mix of strengths and liabilities, shaped by personal choices, circumstances, and the unpredictable forces of culture, policy, and industry change. Their economic impact is a tangle of self-interest, structural incentives, and social contingencies, producing outcomes that are neither fixed nor inevitable. Still, a fragile consensus has emerged that high-skilled workers—no matter their defects—tend to pay off and outperform their low-skilled counterparts. Reality, however, often disagrees.

Nowhere are these disagreements and the nuance of this issue clearer than when looking at the outcomes of immigrants across countries of origin. The high-skilled advantage appears ironclad when comparing Indians—the best educated (75 percent college graduates) and wealthiest ($72,000 median income) of all immigrant groups—to their next-door neighbors from Myanmar, who enter the United States as one of the least educated (23 percent college graduates) and, predictably, earn the least money among all Asian immigrants once here ($26,000 median income).37 Less predictable, however, are the economic gains of Mongolians, who are the third best educated among Asians (63 percent college graduates), yet make only slightly more than those from Myanmar ($28,000 median income) and suffer the highest rate of poverty across all Asian immigrant groups. Part of the explanation is that Mongolian immigrants' rate of married-couple households ranks near the bottom of the Asian distribution—over a full standard deviation and a half below that of immigrants from both Myanmar and India—and second to last (only ahead of China) when it comes to English proficiency among the cohort of most educated Asian countries.38

A similar dynamic is observed when comparing39 sub-Saharan Africans to Caribbean-born Blacks, where the relationship between education (i.e., high-skilled) and money also appears elusive. Although sub-Saharan Africans are among the most educated immigrants in the country, they report some of the lowest incomes and rates of homeownership. Black immigrants from the Caribbean, meanwhile, arrive as one of the least educated groups, but end up with higher incomes and higher rates of homeownership. Disparities like these complicate efforts to predict who will do best and remind us that success is not simply a product of technical expertise, but is deeply influenced by forces such as upbringing, cultural adaptability, social capital, and other variables that are far more difficult to measure.

One easy-to-measure metric, however, is age. Younger-aged immigrants almost always contribute more to the U.S. economy than older ones, regardless of skill level. One study40 showed that immigrants aged 18–24 without a bachelor's degree generate a net-fiscal impact more than twice as large as that of immigrants over 44 with a bachelor's degree. This effect is exaggerated when looking at college graduates over the age of 54, whose net contribution is even less than those who never graduated from high school but who arrived younger than 35.

Even so, the distinction between low-skilled and high-skilled immigrants remains the most salient for most researchers. It offers a clear binary—one rooted in decades of research—and illuminates broader trends, even if it fails to capture certain key nuances or industry-specific dynamics. The first important fact in this debate, however, is that low-skilled immigrants greatly outnumber high-skilled ones. Around two-thirds of all immigrants (legal and illegal) to the United States qualify as low skilled—seventy percent of whom do not even have a high school diploma41—and a handful of broadly generalizable characteristics help explain why they tend to be worse for the economy than their higher skilled counterparts.

For starters, the vast majority of illegal entries into this country are unskilled laborers.42 This means that they avoid any third-party selection process or policy oversight that allows the U.S. government to decide which immigrant category groups are needed where, and to strategize the best ways to integrate them into the economy. Strategies that might include spreading their share of labor across greater geographic distances to avoid oversupplying markets or simply mandating them to learn English. Low-skilled immigrants are also more likely to rely on social welfare,43 contribute less in taxes,44 compete more for jobs in unionized industries where they undermine collective bargaining agreements,45 and exhibit overall lower rates of upward mobility.46 High-skilled immigrants aren't always “better”—but they usually are. Exactly by how much, however, is where the research becomes less clear and defies easy quantification.

Some studies suggest that low-skilled immigrants significantly suppress wages, others suggest only marginal effects, and a few strain to make the case that there are virtually no negative economic impacts linked to importing low-skilled labor whatsoever. The usual suspect in this last category is a 1990 paper published by Berkeley economist David Card.47

Card's study48 sought to determine the effect of mass immigration on native wages by analyzing the Mariel Boatlift—a sanctioned exodus of mostly low-skilled workers from Cuba by Fidel Castro in 1980, which rapidly increased Miami's labor force by more than 125,000. Comparing Miami to cities without an immigration surge, his analysis found no significant impact on wages for native-born workers, even among those without a high school diploma. Although wages in Miami fell overall, he found that they did not drop any more for those he regarded as competing with the Cuban arrivals than for those who weren't. His conclusion ran counter to decades of previous research, but was substantiated by subsequent quasi natural experiments in Israel49 and Denmark,50 which similarly failed to find major wage suppression caused by immigration. The prevailing explanation for these counterintuitive results is that immigrants contribute to both the supply and demand for labor. That is, while they compete for jobs, they also create higher demand for goods and services, fueling employment, and thereby mitigating the expected downward pressure on wages. Card's proponents also argue that the long-term gains from immigration—such as increased entrepreneurship and labor specialization—are rarely captured by most analyses, while the immediate fiscal costs, particularly at the local level, exacerbate public perceptions of harm.51

But Card's work is not without its critics. In 2015, Harvard economist George Borjas reanalyzed52 the Mariel Boatlift, finding unreported, important results obscured by averages in the original work. He, for example, found that high school dropouts experienced a 30 percent wage decline—an outcome he attributed to direct competition between low-skilled immigrants and similarly skilled native workers. While his findings were scrutinized for methodological issues, including a small sample size and selective exclusions, they highlight how aggregate effects often obscure the uneven distribution of impacts across different groups. Research by the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford53 and others,54, 55 lend further support to the more common-sense intuition that low-skilled immigration tends to depress wages and reduce job opportunities, particularly in the short term, before labor markets have time to adjust. Not to mention Card's own findings in subsequent research,56 which predicts that, “an inflow rate of 10 percent for one occupation group would reduce relative wages for [that] occupation by 1.5 percent” and result in “a 0.5-percentage-point reduction in the employment rate of the group.” This same model projects a 3 percent wage loss when the immigrant inflow rate increases to 20 percent.

These numbers, however, are among the more conservative estimates when compared with those published by the National Academy of Sciences57 in a comprehensive 600-plus-page report produced by a committee that included both Borjas and Card. According to their summary, immigration exerts a small to moderate effect on wages, varying based on factors like regional labor supply, industry composition, and macroeconomic conditions—but never in the positive direction.*

The left's claim that immigration doesn't depress wages mirrors the same kind of speculative ideological optimism that Republicans engage in when discussing trickle-down economics and the Laffer curve. For neither group is the question empirical, and for both the flawed logic is evident even without complex data analysis.

In 2007,58 a local chicken-processing company in Stillmore, Georgia, lost 75 percent of its workforce in a single weekend after a raid by federal immigration agents. Within days, the company put up an ad in the local newspaper announcing jobs at higher wages. It's basic economics. When the supply of a good increases, the price of that good falls. When that good is labor, the cheaper price means a cheaper cost of employment (i.e., lower wages). If an abundance of immigrants are obliged to work for low wages, employers have the bargaining advantage. If immigrants are few, however, employers are forced, as the economist Sumner Slichter put it, “to adapt jobs to men rather than men to jobs.”59 And while there is some evidence to suggest that immigrants are working jobs that Americans aren't willing to do, more evidence suggests that it's not a matter of unwillingness to do the job, but rather a matter of unwillingness to do the job at that wage.60, 61

What none of this means, however, is that low-killed immigrant labor is necessarily bad for the economy at large. In fact, one of the chief benefits of immigration is low-cost goods. A broad body of economic literature suggests that immigrants, by expanding the labor force, help keep prices lower for many goods and services. Even more encouraging is the fact that their downward effect on prices is not wholly a function of paying workers less. Research62 by the United Food and Commercial Workers union indicates that, on average, pay to production workers accounts for only about four percent of the price of goods. Therefore, a 25 percent decrease in wages would cause only a one percent increase in prices.

While the majority of research suggests that immigration lowers consumer prices, there are cases where the opposite is true. For goods that cannot be easily scaled, like homes, the cost tends to increase when a market is suddenly flooded with a large influx of immigrants who drive up demand for a fixed asset where the supply cannot expand quickly. Speaking before the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability in September 2024, Steven A. Camarota, Director of Research at the Center for Immigration Studies, was asked to summarize the studied effects of immigration on the cost of living. His congressional testimony detailed how immigrant competition for housing—both rental and ownership—places upward pressure on prices, particularly in urban areas, where a five percent increase in the immigrant population costs “the average household headed by a U.S.-born person … a 12 percent increase in rent, relative to their income.”63

If we only look at macroeconomic indices like GDP, stock market performance, or consumer spending, it seems safe to say that even if low-skilled laborers suffer a reduction in wages, increased immigration is good for the overall economy. But an economy is not just a balance sheet—it exists within a society, and when social cohesion weakens, economic growth alone cannot sustain a nation.

In 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt commissioned a report on the effects of immigration. Four years later, in 1911, a bipartisan committee headed by Senator William Dillingham, published a 41-volume study on the issue.64 In it, they concluded that:

What came to be known as the Dillingham Commission—famous for its data-driven analysis—set American immigration policy over the next half-century. Observing how Gilded Age oligarchs preferred to pack their factories with a motley mix of immigrants who had no common language, no common traditions, and no common sense of solidarity, the commission laid bare something that Carnegie, Rockefeller, and the rest had long understood—social cohesion is the backbone of labor's power. Strong labor movements rely on shared identity, communication, and trust, which vanish when a workforce is fractured along linguistic and cultural lines. A factory floor where workers can't communicate is a factory floor where strikes never get off the ground. Immigration wasn't just a source of cheap labor for industrial barons—it was a strategic tool to divide, weaken, and conquer the working class.65, 66 As Friedrich Engels noted:“[the] bourgeoisie knows … how to play off one nationality against the other: Jews, Italians, Bohemians, etc., against Germans and Irish, and each one against the other.”

Last year (2024) the percentage of foreign born reached the highest levels in our nation's history (over 15 percent), surpassing those of the last massive immigration wave to the United States in the late 19th century.67 A study by the Cato Institute68 found that immigration reduced union membership by 5.7 percent between 1980 and 2020, accounting for 29.7 percent of the overall decline in unions during that period. The authors explain that because “immigrants have a lower preference for unionization and because immigrants increase diversity in the workforce that, in turn, decreases solidarity among workers and raises the transaction costs of forming unions.” Further, unions derive their power from the ability to withhold labor, forcing employers to negotiate on wages and conditions. But when a constant influx of new workers stands ready to replace those on strike, that leverage collapses. It is no coincidence, according to The New York Times columnist David Leonhardt, that union strength and participation precipitously declined after the 1965 immigration bill.69

The economy, like unions, both shapes and is shaped by human behavior. Disentangling the economic effects of immigration from its effect on our institutions, culture, and politics—each of which loop back to re-affect society in often unexpected ways—is impossible. Calculating the fiscal impact of immigrants by isolating variables, like unemployment or the price of goods, without considering broader questions like how immigration impacts who we elect to government or what we think of our neighbors is like measuring physical health without regard to the patient's mental well-being. However great the impact of immigration is on wages, it is unlikely to outweigh the impact of the elected president's tax policy or the nation's social trust. Indeed, it might be said that immigration is good for the economy if it unites Americans behind good economic policies, and it is bad for the economy if it undermines collective action in a way that leaves us vulnerable to bad politicians who exploit the discord.

The social effects of immigration might be compared to American football—“the ultimate team sport.” With a 53-man roster and the most intricate coaching bureaucracy in all of sports, the best football teams are rarely those with the richest owners or most Pro Bowl players. In football, the best teams are those with the best culture. Bill Belichick, widely considered the greatest head coach in NFL history, was notorious for cutting star players and replacing them with less talented ones who better fit the team mentality. One sign hung above all others in the Patriots locker room: “Mental toughness is doing what's right for the team even when it's not what's best for you.”70 Similarly, Sean McVay, Super Bowl winning head coach of the L.A. Rams, has said that he has only one rule for his team, “we over me.”71

Countries are in many ways like football teams. Success depends less on individual ability and more on a shared identity, unifying leadership, and the willingness to put collective interests ahead of personal gains. A team—or a nation—fractured by self-interest falls apart. The political sociologist Robert Putnam72 has argued that the single most important predictor of national prosperity—more than wealth, technology, or education—is social capital, a measure of the norms and networks that enable people to act collectively. High social capital societies produce stronger institutions, greater civic engagement, and overall increased trust among their citizens. Putnam writes:

At its core, every cooperative system—economic, political, social, or otherwise—relies on trust. Modern capitalism, for example, is built on the collective faith that a dollar bill is worth what we all agree it's worth. As Franklin D. Roosevelt explained in his first ever fireside chat74 to the American people: “There is an element in the readjustment of our financial system more important than currency, more important than gold, and that is the confidence of the people.” More famously, he proclaimed that “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” Without confidence in one another, when fear replaces trust, the very mechanisms that allow a country to function—democracy, markets, even basic public order—begin to erode. If we can't leave our doors unlocked, we are less likely to sacrifice for our neighbors at the ballot box. Here is Edmund Burke on the matter:

In his book Bowling Alone, Putnam documents the collapse of social capital in the United States since 1970. Indeed, Americans today spend less time with friends,75 have fewer friends to begin with,76 report fewer positive interactions with strangers,77 and experience less frequent human interaction in general.78 We are more distrustful of institutions79 and our fellow citizens and neighbors.80 We also take less active roles in our communities, join fewer clubs, attend fewer dinner parties, go to church less, participate less in local government and are members of fewer sports leagues—including bowling leagues.81 Meanwhile, government agencies at all three levels—local, state, and federal—have also dramatically decreased their investment in public works projects that enhance social capital such as libraries, parks, and community centers. As a result, America is suffering from a surge of what the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton have called deaths of despair—from alcohol, drugs, or suicide—but which might more accurately be described as deaths due to loneliness.82

Although there are multiple explanations and a host of complex factors contributing to the decline in social capital, one of them is high immigration rates. Putnam's most recent book, The Upswing, divides the last 150 years of American history into three distinct eras. From a hyper-individualistic “me” culture in the Gilded Age to a collective “we” culture beginning at the turn of the 20th century and then back to a new “me” era post the 1960s. Curiously, these divisions map almost exactly onto historical shifts in American immigration policy (i.e., mass immigration during the low social capital Gilded Age, strict restriction during the high social capital Progressive Era, and then again a second wave of mass immigration in the current Neoliberal Era).

Immigration's effect on social capital is well-documented. There are two main explanations for how immigration is expected to affect social capital. The first, known to researchers as the “conflict hypothesis,” requires us to distinguish between two types of social capital: bonding and bridging. Bonding social capital refers to social ties within groups that share a similar background (e.g., families or cultural or ethnic ingroups) and exclude non-members. The Jewish diamond district in New York City, for example, relies on tight networks of Hasidic Jews who sacrifice and collaborate to promote their business among their own community while tending to exclude those who are not members of the ingroup.83

Bridging social capital, on the other hand, generates social networks that transcend differences across groups with different cultural, religious, or ethnic backgrounds. The conflict hypothesis predicts that increased diversity can, under certain conditions, intensify bonding social capital and tighten ingroup networks.84 Under these conditions, collective action and pursuing the common good can become increasingly burdensome. In some cases85 increased diversity has been shown to not only reduce trust between groups but also within ingroups. In the extreme,86 this can cause such a breakdown of overall social capital that no one trusts anyone and parochialism runs riot as various factions are pitted against each other. Putnam's research supports the conflict hypothesis, describing the effect of too much immigration as a sort of “hunkering down.”87

The conflict hypothesis is also supported by evolutionary theory, which suggests that human sociality is built on “parochial altruism”88—the evolved tendency to direct altruism preferentially towards one's own group and eschew interactions with outsiders. If natural selection prefers this type of altruism, then fostering bridging social capital becomes a delicate balancing act that runs against ancient and deep-seated biases. Left unchecked, this behavior can turn hostile when there is competition for scarce resources between groups89 and helps to explain why working class Americans, who are in less of a position to “share the wealth,” hold more bigoted opinions of immigrants.90

A competing theory to the conflict hypothesis is commonly called the “contact hypothesis” of immigration. It predicts that under certain conditions, exposure to people from different backgrounds decreases prejudices and over time increases overall social capital.91 Perhaps the most foundational study supporting the contact hypothesis is research on the integration of Black and White soldiers during WWII.92 The key finding is that White soldiers who had more contact with Black soldiers were more open to serving with them in mixed race platoons. But context here is crucial. Differences between American Blacks and Whites serving in the military are trivial compared to those between immigrants and a host country's native citizens. In the case of the soldiers, both Whites and Blacks shared a common history, culture and language on top of what are probably the most important facts: They were situated in a strict and clear hierarchy (i.e., the military), shared a common enemy, and were putting their lives on the line for a common cause. Outside of these specific conditions, the literature finds little evidence for the contact hypothesis.93

My own research94 tracks the effects of low social capital on our politics, finding that increased isolation and the breakdown of social networks can radicalize voting behavior and reshape electoral coalitions. In Germany, for example, support for right-wing populist parties has been associated with individuals who perceive ethnic outgroups as competitors for scarce resources.95 Another study in Western Europe reveals that “the electoral success of right-wing populist parties among workers seems primarily due to cultural protectionism: the defense of national identity against outsiders [i.e., immigrants].”96 A low-trust society doesn't debate policy—it searches for enemies.

In summary, the dangers of too much diversity distinctly outweigh those of too much immigration. A country can absorb large numbers of immigrants, but not if their difference is their most defining characteristic. The United States, in this respect, is fortunate that the southern border is overflooded with immigrants from culturally compatible nations like Mexico and those in Central America, who, unlike the refugees and economic migrants from the Greater Middle East who overwhelmed Europe in recent years, have proven to be exceptional integrators.97

In his final speech as President of the United States, Ronald Reagan shared with the American people an excerpt from a letter recently received:

The United States is what political scientists and historians describe as an “ideological nation.”99 While most countries have been bound by shared ancestry and geographic borders (i.e., “blood and soil”), the United States is bound by a shared commitment to abstract principles—freedom, equality, opportunity, and so on. In the United States, becoming an American requires none other than that. To be American you do not have to be born here or even speak fluent English, you just have to become “one of us” and celebrate the 4th of July. And for all the accusations of xenophobia or intolerance, many of which hold truth, the evidence is clear: No other country attracts, welcomes, and ultimately integrates their foreign-born population better than the United States.

A study by the Manhattan Institute100 rates the United States as second to only Canada in its assimilation index, which measures the degree of similarity between native and foreign-born populations across various economic, cultural, and civic indicators. The primary reason for Canada's ranking over the U.S., however, results from its higher rate of naturalization. And while it is surely a great benefit, it is less a measure of how accepting and inclusive the culture is, and more a reflection of different policy design. To extend the argument, America demonstrates an unrivaled ability to absorb and assimilate immigrants whose cultural orientations differ dramatically from its own, such as individuals from Muslim societies.

The United States is a nation of immigrants. No other nation has taken in more, no other economy has given them more, and nowhere else have immigrants been so seamlessly woven into the social fabric as in the United States. America's unique ability to absorb a large proportion of newcomers is one of its greatest strengths, fueling an economic dynamism and cultural vibrancy unmatched throughout the world.

A lot of immigration is beneficial when it helps to offset the demographic crises, as countries such as China,101 Japan,102 and many in Northern Europe103 have fallen far below replacement levels. South Korea104 has a total fertility rate of 0.72 (2.1 is needed to maintain a population) and appears headed for extinction within just a few generations. But a lot of immigration works best when immigrants integrate into their new nation, when they share in the national story, embrace common ideals, and feel bound by a sense of collective purpose. In other words, when instead of adding more immigrants to the country, we add—in the case of the United States—more Americans to the country. And our immigration policy works best when it's built on reality, not ideology—when it acknowledges limits, institutes selection hierarchies, prioritizes Americans, and is willing to adapt.

Perhaps it is time to bring back that old idea of America as “the melting pot,” a national creed that has been abandoned by both the “salad bowl” Democrats—where assimilation is seen as a tool of cultural oppression—and the “build the wall” Republicans—who have embraced their own form of salad bowl separatism, treating immigrants as intruders instead of future Americans. The right must recognize that cultural assimilation is a process, not an immediate transformation, while the left must acknowledge that integration requires more than mere presence—it demands a shared commitment to American ideals. Immigrants must be willing to adopt to American values. Immigration, like any successful relationship, requires reciprocity.

Finally, if the country wishes to continue reaping the rewards of immigration, it must first reaffirm its own identity and decide whether it still believes in the promise of America itself.

What began as a call for justice has, in many cases, become an engine of conformity. In this searching conversation, Andrew Doyle (author, satirist, and cultural critic) joins Michael Shermer to unpack the trajectory of the woke movement: from its roots in anti-bigotry and awareness to its current entanglement with censorship, identitarian dogma, and ideological rigidity.

Drawing on his new book, The End of Woke, Doyle traces the intellectual history of contemporary activism, explores the authoritarian impulses emerging on both the left and the right, and makes the case for a return to classical liberalism as a defense against escalating cultural tribalism.

Together, Shermer and Doyle explore themes ranging from the legacy of Shakespeare and Milton, the tension between equality and meritocracy, and the broader sociopolitical dynamics shaping public discourse.

This episode offers a sharp, historically grounded analysis of one of the defining cultural shifts of our time—and a call to revive liberal principles in the face of rising ideological orthodoxy.

Andrew Doyle is a writer, satirist and political commentator. He was formerly a Visiting Research Fellow at Queen's University Belfast, and a lecturer at Oxford University where he completed his doctorate in Renaissance Literature. He is the creator of satirical character Titania McGrath, under whose name he has written two books: Woke: A Guide to Social Justice and My First Little Book of Intersectional Activism, both published by Little, Brown. Titania McGrath has over half a million followers on X. His previous books include Free Speech and Why it Matters and The New Puritans: How the Religion of Social Justice Captured the Western World. His new book is The End of Woke: How the Culture War Went Too Far and What to Expect from the Counter-Revolution.

A prototype of the Tesla Cybercab autonomous vehicle.

The EV maker's CEO said the service will ‘tentatively' start on June 22 but could shift due to safety reasons.

Tesla Inc. already had a lot riding on its highly anticipated robotaxi launch long before Elon Musk decided to swing a wrecking ball through his alliance with President Donald Trump — and the company's share price. Now investors are looking for a win that can help repair the brand damage and shift Tesla back into growth mode.

Musk said Tesla would start the new self-driving car service in Austin as soon as June 22, as part of the EV maker's big bet on artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. While Tesla gave the city an outline of its tentative plans, the company hadn't disclosed a launch date — either publicly or directly to Austin officials — until late on Tuesday, when Musk warned the service's debut could shift because it was “super paranoid about safety.”The proclamation came as part of an all-night series of social media messages by Musk, which included a near-apology that “I regret some of my posts” about the president, which “went too far.” The comments helped push shares up about 3% Wednesday by investors who have been urging Musk to refocus on his business empire.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

The US president has announced a rare earth supply deal with China, signaling a step forward in trade talks. The agreement also includes provisions for Chinese students in the US.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced progress in trade negotiations with China, highlighting a new agreement that would see Beijing supply the world's biggest economy with ""magnets, and any necessary rare earths.""

Rare earth elements are critical for various high-tech industries, and China is the world's dominant supplier. The agreement marks a potential de-escalation in trade tensions between the two economic powers.

The deal follows two days of talks in London, where rare earth exports were a major point of contention. Trump said the agreement — pending final approval from both him and Chinese President Xi Jinping — also includes a provision allowing Chinese students to continue studying at US colleges.

""Our deal with China is done, subject to final approval with President Xi and me,"" Trump said in an online post.

""Full magnets, and any necessary rare earths, will be supplied, upfront, by China. Likewise, we will provide to China what was agreed to, including Chinese students using our colleges and universities (which has always been good with me!).""

""We are getting a total of 55% tariffs, China is getting 10%. Relationship is excellent! Thank you for your attention to this matter!""

The announcement followed two days of talks in the British capital that ended late Tuesday. The meetings appeared to focus on finding a way to resolve disputes over mineral and technology exports that had shaken a fragile truce on trade reached in Geneva last month.

It remained initially unclear whether any progress was made on the more fundamental differences over China's sizeable trade surplus with the US.

Since then, the US and China have exchanged angry words over advanced semiconductors that power artificial intelligence, Chinese students at US universities and rare earth minerals — raw materials vital to carmakers and other industries.

Trump spoke with Xi by phone last week to try to calm the waters.

Li Chenggang, a vice minister of commerce and China's international trade representative, said the two sides had agreed in principle on a framework for implementing the consensus agreed in Geneva.

The ongoing trade dispute between Washington and Beijing has continued to intensify since Trump initiated a trade war in February. The two economic giants have exchanged multiple rounds of tariffs, creating turbulence in global markets. In a significant escalation, Trump raised import duties on Chinese goods to as high as 145% in April.

The last time U.S. President Donald Trump attended a Group of Seven (G-7) leaders' summit in Canada, in 2018, he treated it like a reality TV show. “Trump Blows Up G7 Agenda,” read the headline in Politico. Trump arrived late; called for Russia's readmission to the group (a nonstarter with the other members); described the host, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as “very dishonest and weak”; and refused at the last minute to endorse the joint statement at the end of the meeting.

This month, as leaders of the advanced industrialized democracies that make up the G-7—Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States—prepare for their annual summit, Canada is hosting once again. With Trump's tariff war in full swing and targeting the other countries in attendance, this meeting could be even more contentious than his last visit.

But it doesn't have to be. The G-7 has the potential to play a meaningful role in global governance: taking on a position the Trump administration does not want for the United States and addressing the problems of burden sharing that appear to lie at the root of many of Trump's concerns about U.S. global leadership. In previous meetings, G-7 members have made clear their interest in addressing technological advancements, public health, major wars, and other issues beyond the group's traditional mandate. With many international institutions today paralyzed by geopolitical rivalries, the world needs concerted action now more than ever.

Yet to truly turn the G-7 into a body that can sustain the rules-based order, its members need to bolster their ranks, streamline their procedures, and strengthen the group's legitimacy in the eyes of the world. Pulling off this reinvention would position the G-7 for leadership—and could even be the kind of sweeping project that appeals to Trump.

Global governance is in crisis. Wars in Europe and the Middle East, collusion among autocratic powers, and possible nuclear proliferation in Asia and the Middle East have divided members of the UN Security Council, making the once active body effectively nonfunctional. In the last five years alone, Russia has vetoed 14 draft Security Council resolutions on Gaza, Mali, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, nuclear proliferation, and human rights. China has aided this obstruction in 11 of these cases, voting down five resolutions and abstaining from the votes for six. Yet advances in artificial intelligence and synthetic biology require new standards and norms, and the need for resilient supply chains, pandemic preparedness, and clean development demands that countries work together to solve problems—none of which is possible under the current global system.

Without a functioning UN, it falls on individual countries or institutions to uphold the international order. But under Trump, the United States has abdicated its role as the underwriter of the post–World War II rules-based system. The Trump administration is not interested in promoting due process, accountability, representative governance, open capital flows, or liberal trade policies. Authoritarian governments in China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia are working together to undermine, not to support, the institutions and norms of the order. Many middle powers—such as Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey—want to use the liberal order when it helps them, but they also want to engage with the authoritarian axis. Countries in the global South, meanwhile, are not powerful enough to lead.

Many institutions are not strong candidates for leadership, either. The G-20 was a stabilizing force during the 2008 global financial crisis, but the size of the grouping and the rivalries among China, Russia, the United States, and others have since hamstrung its ability to take collective action. The World Trade Organization, with over 160 members, cannot find consensus on anything, and it has failed to stop China or the United States from weaponizing trade against each other and the world. The ten-country BRICS bloc—which includes founding members Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, as well as five newer members—seeks to diminish international institutions historically dominated by the West.

Smaller groupings have proliferated as countries search for alternative rule-making bodies. In the last decade, these have included the Quad (a diplomatic partnership among Australia, India, Japan, and the United States), AUKUS (a security partnership among Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (a U.S.-led economic initiative with 14 members), the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (a 12-country free trade agreement), and trilateral cooperation among Japan, South Korea, and the United States. But none of these groups are currently in a position to set rules that the rest of the world might sign on to.

The body that develops solutions to today's global problems must be composed of governments that trust each other, share similar values, possess significant economic and political power, and have a track record of working together. This is where the G-7 comes in. As a group of like-minded advanced industrialized democracies, it is the only institution that can meet this mandate. The United States has always been an important player in the G-7, but the group's other members will have to become more fully capable of sharing the burden of leadership in a new era of “America first” policies by Washington. Before they can play this role, however, the G-7 must be overhauled.

The origins of the G-7 lie in the global oil crisis of the early 1970s. In 1973, finance ministers from France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States convened an informal meeting to coordinate monetary policy in response to the economic shock. Italy and Japan joined the group later that year, Canada joined in 1977, and Russia joined in 1998 (but was expelled in 2014, after its invasion of Crimea). Today, the European Union is also represented in the G-7, with a seat each for the European Council and the European Commission.

For most of its history, the G-7 was a club of rich countries that met to coordinate monetary and macroeconomic policies to combat inflation and recession, and to promote free trade. The club would reach agreements such as the 1985 Plaza Accord, in which European economies agreed to allow their currencies to appreciate against the U.S. dollar for macroeconomic balance. But in the past few years, as the COVID-19 pandemic, economic disruption, climate change, and major wars have demanded global attention, the G-7 has expanded its portfolio. The statement released after the 2023 G-7 leaders' summit in Hiroshima, Japan, for instance, emphasized global governance issues that were not even on the G-7's radar five years earlier. Members prioritized topics such as the future of the Indo-Pacific, the war in Ukraine, economic resilience, food security, digital competitiveness, climate change, sustainable development, labor, and nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation. For example, the Hiroshima summit produced task forces on improving global health infrastructure, combating economic coercion, building robust cyberdefenses, and coordinating the confiscation of frozen Russian assets related to the war in Ukraine. At the 2024 G-7 summit in Italy, the leaders agreed to provide $50 billion in funds for Ukraine using interest from the frozen Russian assets.

But the G-7 faces a dilemma: it wants to play a larger role in global governance but is not currently well equipped for the part. From the 1970s to the mid-1990s, the G-7 represented as much as 67 percent of world GDP. Today, that number is now barely over 40 percent, and less than ten percent of the global population resides in G-7 countries. The group does not, and should not, harbor expectations that it could replace the UN Security Council and create mandates for all the world to comply with, as the Security Council is set up to do. But the G-7 can aim for meaningful action that sustains global order. By coordinating their economic, development, security, energy, and technology policies, its members can impose sanctions to deter conflict, set rules and norms to keep pace with technological innovation, punish predatory economic behavior, support democratic governance, combat disinformation, and help the developing world with food security and labor standards.

The G-7 must embrace reform to meet the moment. The world needs effective governance institutions, and to serve that purpose the G-7 needs to broaden its scope, enhance its capabilities, and add new voices to its deliberations. The first place to start is membership. Expanding the G-7 is not without controversy. Many of the group's representatives value its exclusiveness and worry that adding new members could make it as unwieldy as the G-20. But if the G-7 is to take on additional responsibilities, it will need additional partners with commensurate capabilities to share the work. The body today is also geographically imbalanced. European countries or institutions hold six of its nine seats. Just one country, Japan, represents the whole of Asia, and no member represents the developing world.

Australia and South Korea should be at the front of the line to join the G-7. G-7 representatives opine that any new members must be responsible stewards of the international economy, be capable of and committed to assuming this role, and, importantly, have the trust of the other G-7 members. Canberra and Seoul clearly meet this standard. Australia has a per capita GDP larger than all G-7 states except the United States; among democracies it has the 12th largest economy in the world. South Korea is a technological and cultural powerhouse and has the largest economy among non-G-7 industrialized democracies except for India and Brazil. Australia has fought on the side of democracy and a rules-based order in every major war since World War I; South Korea has done so since the Korean War.

Both countries have also taken leading roles already in addressing issues that preoccupy the G-7. Australia has shone as an example of a country standing up to economic coercion by China. In 2020, Canberra demanded an international investigation into the origins of the COVID virus and, over more than two years, withstood massive Chinese retaliatory tariffs against Australian beef, barley, and wine by diversifying its export markets away from China. Australia is also a key supplier of critical minerals to other industrialized democracies. South Korea is a major provider of economic and indirect military assistance to Ukraine, and it is a critical player, along with the United States and Japan, in protecting the lead in critical emerging semiconductor chip technology in the West's competition with China. Over the past few years, moreover, both countries have convened international summits on global health, anticorruption efforts, artificial intelligence, and a host of other pressing issues, demonstrating their commitment to providing public goods for the international system.

Australia and South Korea even outperform some current G-7 members in critical areas identified by G-7 leaders. In a 2024 study for the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Cha and Hamre analyzed more than 300 publicly available measures of country performance for all G-7 members as well as Korea and Australia, using data from 2023. We focused on performance across seven issues that the G-7 has identified as priorities: climate change; digital competitiveness; economic resilience and supply chain security; food security; global economy finance, and sustainable development; labor standards; and support for Ukraine. In each issue area, we used the relevant performance metrics to give each country a numerical rank score. Taking the average of all these issue-specific scores, Australia and South Korea ranked higher than several current G-7 members including France, Italy, and Japan. On digital competitiveness, measured across 160 rankings, South Korea performs better than every G-7 country except the United Kingdom and the United States. On economic resilience and supply chain security, measured across 20 available rankings, Australia ranks above every country except Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In aggregate, South Korea ranks eighth among G-7 members in terms of overall performance, ahead of Italy, and Australia ranks fifth, ahead of France, Japan, and Italy. By contrast, another major democracy, India, ranked below Italy in terms of aggregate performance across all the priority issue areas. Australia's and South Korea's capabilities as high performers on the very issues deemed critical to G-7 leadership would bring added value to the group.

The Indo-Pacific region now is the center of gravity in global commerce and, arguably, in global politics. Adding Australia and South Korea to the G-7 could boost the representation of the wider Indo-Pacific, giving the region's interests a stronger voice than Japan can offer alone. To further balance the G-7's configuration, the EU's two seats in the body should also be consolidated into one. If the European G-7 members demand that the open seat go to another European country—several of which perform respectably in the G-7's priority areas—Spain could be a good candidate. According to the 2024 CSIS study, Spain ranked higher than the lowest-ranked G-7 member, Italy, on four out of the seven priority issue areas—and performed better on climate change issues (33 metrics) than all G-7 countries except Germany and the United Kingdom. As a member, Spain could expand the G-7's reach by providing Spanish-speaking representation, which has been absent from the group. By extension, Spain's membership could provide a bridge between the G-7 and Latin America.

Institutional reform could also make the G-7 more effective. At present, the agenda for each summit is set by the host country in an informal process. This makes the group flexible, open to frank discussions, and able to act quickly, but the downside is that G-7 efforts lack consistency. At the close of the 2023 Hiroshima summit, for example, G-7 leaders laid out an ambitious agenda to establish a G-7 Coordination Platform on Economic Coercion by authoritarian regimes, as well as guiding principles on the development of advanced AI systems. Then, at the next meeting, in 2024, the host, Italy, chose to focus on migration from North Africa. Next week's G-7 summit in Canada focuses on energy security and accelerating the digital transition. All these issues are important. But the discontinuity in the G-7's agenda sends confusing signals to the rest of the world and results in the body not following through on its announced commitments.

To solve this problem, the structure of the G-7 must be reformed. In particular, a consultative body, or troika, composed of representatives from the past, current, and next year's G-7 hosts should set G-7 meeting agendas, replacing today's informal system. The current host would invite the previous host and the successor host together to plan out the year's conferences. Planning annual conferences in this way would give the meetings more continuity from year to year.

In addition, establishing a permanent secretariat would provide the G-7 with an administrative home, regular staff support for the troika and the related task forces, and an archive for G-7 deliverables. The politics of who should host this office are probably least complicated by locating it in Canada. Formal task forces could track member countries' commitments to G-7 goals and ensure that progress continues between summits. In the G-7 structure, host countries provide most of the technical support for the group's initiatives, but the temporary nature of the support contributes to continuity problems. The G-7 instead needs to be supported by ongoing and permanent technical expertise on priority issues such as climate change, AI, and global health. This expertise could be provided through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which could lend data and networks of experts from its AI Policy Observatory, its climate adaptation and resilience policy shop, and its health statistics group.

Emerging and middle powers and countries in the global South must also be more involved in a reimagined G-7. The list should include multilateral organizations, such as the African Union, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the G-20, as well as prominent countries outside the G-7, particularly China. Before the leaders' summits, the troika countries would host formalized consultation channels with these organizations and countries through the foreign and finance ministers' tracks to discuss the agenda and expected deliverables. After the summit, the consultation channels would link up with the same organizations and countries to discuss implementation and task forces. Institutionalizing outreach to developing economies in this way could demonstrate the G-7's commitment to inclusivity and confer more legitimacy on its decisions. In the near term, the G-7 could engage outside countries on issues of proximate concern by supporting their economic development and climate goals, fostering new norms and standards for AI and other emerging technologies, and shaping their opposition to disruption to the global order by China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.

For years, G-7 members have resisted the impetus for reform. That resistance was tolerated because global governance institutions were functioning, the United States helped underwrite world order, and there was general stability in the international system. When the leaders meet in Canada, they need to recognize that none of these conditions hold today, and that a new, reimagined G-7 needs to step up to fill the void. There is even a chance that Trump could get on board with G-7 reform, despite his general disdain for international institutions. Trump is drawn to any big policy for which he can take credit, and transforming the G-7 from a sluggish group into one that is action-oriented could qualify. According to Trump's former representatives at the G-7, expanding and reforming the body could appeal to the president's interest in getting U.S. allies to contribute more to the costs of global leadership and relieving the United States of the burden. Adding new members such as Australia, South Korea, and Spain could also deflect Trump's call, which he repeated as recently as February, for the group to readmit Russia, an idea that the rest of the G-7 countries reject. Trump might also like to see the organization's European dominance diluted by new players from the Indo-Pacific, particularly Australia and South Korea, who would owe their membership to him.

Trump's “America first” inclinations are a part of the reason for the disarray in the world today, as the United States' disenchantment with leadership creates a void in global governance. If that void is left unfilled, other actors or institutions may seek to impose less desirable and even dangerous forms of rule. It would be far better for the G-7 to serve as the champion of a rules-based system that the world so urgently needs.
