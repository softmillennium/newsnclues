                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Customs and Border Protection says it will be “suited and booted” at FIFA Club World Cup games across the country this summer. The agency, which operates under Homeland Security and its secretary, Kristi Noem, confirmed on social media that it will be present and “ready to provide security for the first round of games.” The competition's first match is scheduled for Saturday evening between Lionel Messi-led Inter Miami and Egypt's Al-Ahly in South Florida. CBP shared its statement on Tuesday but deleted it the following morning. “The first FIFA Club World Cup games start on June 14th in Miami… CBP will be suited and booted and ready to provide security for the first round of games.” DHS and CBP did not immediately respond to questions emailed by the Daily Beast. Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst at the Florida Immigrant Coalition, told NBC Miami that the presence of federal agents may keep people from attending matches, both U.S.-based fans and the tens of thousands initially expected to visit from abroad. There are already some examples of ICE tensions canceling fans' plans, as one Boston-based supporter of the Brazilian club Flamengo said his supporter group has called off its public watch parties over fears of an immigration sweep. “The messaging that CBP is using is a bit cryptic; it's sort of alluding that people should have their paperwork in order to attend the games,” Kennedy said. “It creates an environment where people are less likely to come watch the games because of just sheer intimidation.” The cheapest tickets to its opening match in Miami Gardens have been slashed from costing $349 when they first went on sale last year to as cheap as $55 last week, with more than 10,000 seats still unsold, Reuters reported. Canada Men's National Team manager Jesse Marsch, an American national, said he fears foreign tourists will not feel safe in America during MAGA 2.0. “So it's a sad thing, I think, that we have to talk about visiting the U.S. in this way, but I think everybody has to make decisions that are best for them and that fit best with what's going on in their life and their lifestyle.” Trump has acknowledged the importance of this summer's competition and even created a position to oversee it, but handed that gig to Rudy Giuliani's son, who has no background in soccer. “Of course, everyone is welcome to come and see this wonderful event,” Vance said at a White House event last month.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tyler Adams says the U.S. soccer team has tuned out criticism from former players. Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey, who share the American goals record with 57 each, are among those who have been critical of current regulars not in the struggling roster preparing for the CONCACAF Gold Cup. "We don't talk about that internally as a group," Adams said Wednesday during a Zoom interview with The Associated Press.

Watching Portugal celebrate its win over Spain in Sunday's European Nations League final, Donovan said on the Fox postgame show: "I can't help but think about our guys on vacation not wanting to play in Gold Cup." Pulisic has not spoken publicly of his decision. The U.S. has lost four straight games, its longest skid since 2007, following a 4-0 rout Tuesday night by Switzerland. "This is part of the process," Adams said. More of an overuse thing probably than anything — overload. "Progressing well right now, but just trying to be smart and manage it." Adams, who captained the U.S. at the 2022 World Cup, funded a pair of mini-pitches at Pulaski Park in Poughkeepsie, New York, near his home in Wappinger. "Before the World Cup hopefully we plan to do one more with a city unnamed yet," Adams said. "It's something that I think has real impact, continues to grow the sport, serves underserved communities." [RELATED: Projecting the USMNT's World Cup squad: Luna over Reyna? Now 26, Adams is feeling back to his old self. He had back surgery last July with Dr. Robert Watkins and returned to the field with England's Bournemouth on Oct. 26. Adams played in 28 Premier League matches this season after being limited to three in 2023-24 because of leg injuries. "It's definitely enjoyable when you're healthy," he said. "The 16-to-18 months that it was just on and off inconsistency is something I never had in my career and never had to battle. And then when it hits you and you go through that, you just learn different ways to navigate things, enjoy life, just not take things for granted, all the little things." Since Mauricio Pochettino took over as U.S. coach last fall, players have had more autonomy to break away from rigid positioning employed by his predecessor, Gregg Berhalter. "Maurizio gives the players freedom to find spots they're comfortable in and see how they can affect the game in different ways. So, yeah, I think he gives everyone freedom, but there's still structure to the way that we want to play." Adams will be with the U.S. team in Austin, Texas, next Wednesday, and following intently when the Premier League releases its 2025-26 schedule at 3 a.m. CDT. He feels improved because of his time with Leeds in 2022-23 and Bournemouth the past two seasons. "After you play in the Premier League, every game feels slow,'" he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fifa will hold a consultation about expanding the Club World Cup to 48 teams in 2029 if this summer's edition is successful, after lobbying from clubs who failed to qualify for the new $1bn (£740m) tournament. That is about £25m less than Paris Saint-Germain banked from Uefa for their 17-game Champions League-winning campaign, leading to concerns from clubs who have missed out. Barcelona, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Milan are among the big clubs with large fanbases who have not qualified and unless Fifa lifts its cap of 12 European entrants, expansion is the only way to ensure more European competitors. Fifa sources said that although serious discussions regarding expansion had yet to take place, talks with all stakeholders about the Club World Cup's format and structure would be held after this summer's tournament. Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid qualified as Champions League winners during that period, with nine European clubs qualifying through Uefa rankings because Madrid won the competition twice, in 2022 and 2024. Fifa has waived the two-per-country limit for clubs that won their continental competition in that period, leading to Brazil having four clubs from four successive Copa Libertadores victories. The US have three clubs taking part after Los Angeles beat the Mexican side Club América in a playoff triggered by the expulsion of Club León for a breach of multi-club ownership rules. In an interview with the Athletic last week Fifa's general secretary, Mattias Grafström, said all options were open for 2029. “I believe strongly in the future of this competition.” Expanding the Club World Cup would be well received in particular by European clubs, whose commercial strength and global popularity are not reflected in this year's entry list. A bigger tournament involving more of the bigger European clubs would also suit Fifa, which initially struggled to sell commercial deals for the competition. Dazn agreed to pay $1bn for global TV rights in a deal that allows it to sublicense to other broadcasters on a regional basis, with Channel 5 buying the rights for 23 matches in the UK. The longtime Fifa sponsors Adidas, Coca-Cola and Visa have also come on board after initially resisting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, such an impressive history in the competition will matter little heading into this summer's reformatted and expanded iteration of the tournament, with 32 teams from across all six continental federations fighting for world champion status. Madrid will undoubtedly be among the leading candidates to win the competition in its rebirth year, owing largely to their ludicrously talented squad. Despite a difficult 2024–25 season, there can be no doubting the immense talent Los Blancos boast. Competing clubs must travel with 26 to 35 players and Madrid submitted their official squad list on June 10 after the summer's first transfer window slammed shut. The Spanish giants will have an extra opportunity to add to their roster midway through the tournament, with another registration period spanning between June 27 and 3 July. In this time Madrid will be able to add no more than six players, including two that won't contribute to their final 35-man squad list. However, Madrid won't be able to register any players who have already competed at the tournament for another club, such as Benfica's Álvaro Carreras who is a transfer target for Los Blancos. Madrid have confirmed their 34-man squad for the Club World Cup, with a host of injured stars returning to the team, new signings featuring and a number of youngsters making the cut for clashes with Al Hilal, Pachuca and Salzburg. Madrid will not only travel to the U.S. with several new players in their squad, they will jet off under new management. Alonso's first acquisitions since taking the Madrid job have been impressive, with Trent Alexander-Arnold poached from another one of his former clubs, Liverpool. The right back is currently on international duty with England but has been named in the Club World Cup squad after an agreement was reached with the Reds, who will pocket as much as £10 million ($13.5 million) by letting the defender end his contract early. Another Premier League defender who has teamed up with Madrid is Dean Huijsen. The former Bournemouth starlet helps ease issues at center back for Alonso and will travel to the Club World Cup. Injuries threatened to be Madrid's greatest hurdle at the Club World Cup but a host of long-term absentees have been named in Alonso's squad. How much they can feature at the tournament remains to be seen, though. Despite their contracts expiring at the end of June, both Luka Modric and Lucas Vázquez will represent Madrid at the tournament for their final appearances before departures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following the U.S. Men's National Team's fourth consecutive loss on Tuesday, falling 4-0 to Switzerland, former international Alexi Lalas suggested that U.S. Soccer may be starting to panic. Just a year away from the FIFA World Cup, which will be held in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT has continued to struggle to show any form of identity or cohesive vision on the field. Losses to Panama and Canada at the CONCACAF Nations League Finals in March prompted heavy criticism from fans and former players alike, with many left questioning the desire of this generation of stars. “But, pushing all of those chips into next summer, but not only doing that, but on the other side, when we are seeing these games, I mean, there have to be panic buttons being pushed behind the scenes and certainly out there in American soccer land.” Delving deeper into the performance of Pochettino's side against Switzerland, which saw him make nine changes from their loss to Turkey in an attempt to give fresh faces a chance to shine, his side ultimately fell flat early on, going 4-0 down within 36 minutes. “The lack of energy, the lack of commitment, and in particular, because it's easy just to say, ‘spirit, energy, commitment,' I think the lack of the ability to press as a team and to be capable of doing it,” Lalas said of a team which is missing multiple presumptive starters such as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, and Antonee Robinson this summer. “And this is where I get into Mauricio Pochettino, I don't think that he should be absolved by any stretch of the imagination with what is going on here.” “And I do think that, to be fair, even though this is a criticism, these players from a pure soccer perspective, individually and collectively, this group was not up to it.” Perhaps fortunately for the USMNT, there is no time to sit and dwell on this latest gut punch, with their Gold Cup opener against Trinidad and Tobago scheduled for Sunday in San Jose. This will be followed by a trip to Austin on June 19, where they will face Saudi Arabia, before staying in Texas to take on Haiti in Arlington three days later.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen have been included in Real Madrid's squad for the Club World Cup. The 15-time European champions reached an agreement with Liverpool last month for Alexander-Arnold to join early and play in FIFA's newly-expanded tournament for his new club. Huijsen joined in a £50million ($67.7m) deal from Bournemouth and will line up in a new-look defence alongside Alexander-Arnold under head coach Xabi Alonso. The 43-year-old former midfielder was confirmed as Carlo Ancelotti's successor as Madrid head coach on May 25, signing a three-year deal with the club. Luka Modric is also included ahead of his departure from the Bernabeu. The 33-year-old, who has deputised at right-back for long periods of his Madrid career, will leave following the expiration of his contract this month. Fellow full-back Dani Carvajal, who has been sidelined since injuring his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in October, has also been selected alongside a host of youngsters including Sergio Mestre, Youssef Enriquez (Yusi), Jacobo Ramon, Jesus Fortea, Diego Aguado, Chema Andres, Mario Martin, Gonzalo Garcia and Victor Munoz. Madrid's 2024-25 season was one of the club's most difficult domestic campaigns in recent years. Defenders: Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, David Alaba, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Lucas Vazquez, Fran Garcaa, Antonio Rudiger, Ferland Mendy, Dean Huijsen, Youssef Enriquez, Jacobo Ramon, Raul Asencio, Jesus Fortea, Diego Aguado Midfielders: Jude Bellingham, Eduardo Camavinga, Fede Valverde, Luka Modric, Aurelien Tchouameni, Arda Guler, Dani Ceballos, Chema Andres, Victor Munoz, Mario Martin Forwards: Vinicius Junior, Kylian Mbappe, Rodrygo, Endrick, Brahim Diaz, Gonzalo Garcia In terms of signings, Madrid had hoped to have three available by now but so far they only have two: Huijsen and Alexander-Arnold. The third was left-back Alvaro Carreras, who Madrid are still working to sign for July but who has been included in Benfica's squad for the tournament. Strikers Garcia and Munoz, meanwhile, will be looking to impress. Club World Cup spaces were allocated based on performances in the Champions League over four seasons from 2020-21 up to and including this season. Madrid have lifted the Champions League twice during that time, in 2022 and 2024. In December 2024, FIFA agreed a deal with streaming service DAZN for the global rights to broadcast all 63 games, claiming it to be worth around $1billion. In the United States, 24 games across the group and knockout stages will be shown on TNT Sports' cable networks TNT, TBS and truTV. Every game will be shown on TNT's streaming service.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Blues kick off their tournament on Monday, June 16 as they take on Los Angeles FC at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. Djordje Petrovic has also not been included despite the Serbian goalkeeper impressing while on loan at Strasbourg. The 22-year-old striker completed a £30million move from Ipswich Town last week and he could be in line to make his Chelsea debut on Monday evening in Atlanta. Mike Penders, who has arrived from Genk this summer, is among the four goalkeepers that also include Robert Sanchez, Filip Jorgensen and Gabriel Slonina. As mentioned, Santos will take part in his first competitive action for Chelsea since signing two years ago. Tyrique George and Josh Acheampong have both been awarded with a place in the 28-man squad after fine respective breakthrough seasons. Defenders: Marc Cucurella, Tosin Adarabioyo, Benoit Badiashile, Levi Colwill, Mamadou Sarr, Trevoh Chalobah, Reece James, Malo Gusto, Aaron Anselmino, Josh Acheampong Midfielders: Moises Caicedo, Andrey Santos, Romeo Lavia, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Dario Essugo, Enzo Fernandez Attackers: Pedro Neto, Liam Delap, Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Nicolas Jackson, Christopher Nkunku, Tyrique George, Marc Guiu The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Raheem Sterling and Jack Grealish spent one season together at Manchester City Raheem Sterling, Joao Felix, Axel Disasi and Ben Chilwell have been left out of Chelsea's squad for the Fifa Club World Cup, while Jack Grealish has not been selected by Manchester City. England forward Grealish was expected to miss out, with the 29-year-old having started just seven league games in 2024-25. City's 27-man squad also does not include former captain Kyle Walker, who spent the second half of last season on loan at AC Milan, but features England defender John Stones, who has not played since February with a thigh injury. Chelsea's 28-man group does not feature a quartet which cost them about £179m in transfer fees and all ended last season out on loan. Sterling cost £50m when he arrived from Manchester City in 2022, but the 30-year-old England forward spent last season on loan with Arsenal, starting just 13 games and scoring once. Felix made a permanent move to Chelsea last summer for £45m and scored seven goals from 20 appearances before the Portugal forward, 25, ended the campaign on loan at AC Milan. Serbia goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic, 25, will not be travelling to the US either, after spending last season on loan with Strasbourg. Defenders: Marc Cucurella, Tosin Adarabioyo, Benoit Badiashile, Levi Colwill, Mamadou Sarr, Moises Caicedo, Trevoh Chalobah, Reece James, Malo Gusto, Aaron Anselmino, Josh Acheampong. Midfielders: Pedro Neto, Enzo Fernandez, Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Dario Essugo, Andrey Santos, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Romeo Lavia. Forwards: Liam Delap, Nicolas Jackson, Christopher Nkunku, Tyrique George, Marc Guiu. Why are Chelsea in the Club World Cup, but not Liverpool? Man City sign £46.5m Reijnders - but where will he fit in? Grealish's future is unclear as he has struggled for regular playing time with Manchester City over the past two seasons. Stones, 31, will return to action despite missing international duty with England over the weekend, and Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, 28, will continue his comeback from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in September. Defenders: Ruben Dias, John Stones, Nathan Ake, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Vitor Reis, Josko Gvardiol, Manuel Akanji, Abdukodir Khusanov, Rico Lewis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But before a single ball is kicked at the 2026 World Cup next summer, there remains more than 200 nations competing in hundreds of matches to try to qualify for the tournament. Even with the extra space, we've seen plenty of historically successful soccer nations miss the World Cup before (I'm looking at you, Italy), and there are bound to be a few surprises along the way. Here are the continental breakdowns for qualifying, which is already well underway. (Fair warning: This is borderline impossible, but it's a fun thought exercise.) As a result, the rankings are reflective of both form and talent, and they're forward-looking to the best prospects of qualifying. The most notable omission is Nigeria, who is currently on the outside looking in as far as qualifying in Africa. Without further ado, here are the 52 potential World Cup teams, ranked. Exactly One Year to Go Until the 2026 World Cup What Will the World Cup Stand For in an Isolationist America? FIFA's Club World Cup Is an Audacious Bet on Limitless Growth—and Greed Exactly One Year to Go Until the 2026 World Cup What Will the World Cup Stand For in an Isolationist America? FIFA's Club World Cup Is an Audacious Bet on Limitless Growth—and Greed Fact to know: New Caledonia is ranked 151st in the FIFA World Rankings, 65 spots lower than any other team on this list Fact to know: El Salvador has qualified for the World Cup twice (1970, 1982) but has lost all six of its group-stage matches El Salvador was placed into the most interesting Gold Cup group—with Canada, Honduras, and Curacao—this summer, which will give us a good look at how they stack up when the competition kicks off on June 14. The Hondurans have never won a World Cup match before, and while they're ultimately unlikely to qualify, CONCACAF is the land of opportunity in this World Cup cycle. Fact to know: Iraq has made one World Cup appearance, in 1986 Given the depth of opposition in South America and Africa, odds are this ninth Asian team will not actually make it into the final 48. Iraq was beaten twice by South Korea during qualifying, but they did pull off an upset against Japan during the Asian Cup last year, which led to them winning their group during group play. Fact to know: Then known as Zaire, DR Congo was the first sub-Saharan team to ever qualify for the World Cup in 1974 They're currently in a tough battle with Senegal for first place in their qualifying group, but DR Congo will be one of the favorites to claim the last African spot if they do fall out of the top spot. DR Congo is fresh off a solid showing in the last African Cup of Nations (AFCON), where they knocked out Egypt and Guinea before losing to eventual champion Ivory Coast in the semifinal. Venezuela is most likely to be that team, and they're coming off an impressive showing at the Copa Ámerica last summer. They won all three matches in their group against Ecuador, Mexico, and Jamaica—all teams likely to qualify for this World Cup. Club-wise, New Zealand has players scattered across the globe, but none are more renowned than Nottingham Forest striker Chris Wood. Fact to know: Costa Rica is the last CONCACAF team to advance past the round of 16 in a World Cup, as they were quarterfinalists in 2014 This is not your older brother's Costa Rica squad. Unfortunately, Costa Rica's overall talent level is headed in the wrong direction following a golden generation that brought so much success at the international level. They have had a strong start in CONCACAF qualifying thus far, but trying to figure out which teams will qualify behind the clear top four in the confederation (Panama and the three hosts) is a difficult task right now. Goalkeeper Keylor Navas, 38, once of Real Madrid and PSG fame, captained the side in a qualifying win against the Bahamas last week. Leon Bailey had a public feud with the top brass in the Jamaican soccer apparatus, but it appears they've moved on and settled their dispute. Jamaica was placed in arguably the most balanced group at Copa Ámerica (Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela) and still lost all three games. They've again been placed in a fairly even group at this summer's Gold Cup and we'll get to see if they can advance in a group with Guadeloupe, Panama, and Guatemala. Leon Bailey and Demarai Gray are two wide forwards that give Jamaica a real threat playing on the break and in transition. UAE's run at the Asian Cup last year ended earlier than expected with a round of 16 penalty shootout loss to Tajikistan. Fact to know: Hervé Renard is back as Saudi Arabia manager after leading them at the last World Cup Saudi Arabia's win against Argentina in their opening game of the 2022 World Cup is legitimately one of the biggest upsets in world soccer history. Hervé Renard's leaked halftime speech to the dressing room has become famous worldwide. Odds are Saudi Arabia won't top the win against Argentina in this World Cup, and they are still far from assured a qualifying place. Their guest Gold Cup appearance this summer will present real opportunities for Renard to mold the team in his image before the key qualifying playoff matches this fall. Fact to know: Jordan is making its World Cup debut in 2026 Jordan is in the midst of their best-ever run as a soccer-playing nation right now. It was one of the most fascinating runs in recent tournament history, as Jordan scored twice in stoppage time to beat Iraq in the round of 16, won on an own goal in the quarterfinal against Tajikistan, but then lost the final by conceding three penalties to Qatar. Jordan will hope to be just as entertaining in North America next summer. Fact to know: Uzbekistan is making its World Cup debut in 2026 Roma's Eldor Shomurodov, who captains the Uzbekistan national team, tallied four goals and four assists for Roma in Serie A this season, and Abdukodir Khusanov earned a big-money move to Manchester City in January. They played Iran to a draw in both qualifying matches, which should provide some optimism for their chances to be competitive in their debutant appearance next summer. When they were paired up with African heavyweight Nigeria in their qualifying group, they started as sizable underdogs to make this list. Mark your calendars: The most important game is in September, when South Africa hosts Nigeria. Fact to know: Panama first qualified for the World Cup in 2018 but lost all three games with a minus-9 goal differential Panama is the clear fourth-strongest team in North America right now, behind the three hosts of 2026 and ahead of challengers Costa Rica and Jamaica. Fact to know: Australia advanced from their group in the 2022 World Cup over Denmark and Tunisia before losing to eventual champions Argentina Australia won the Asian Cup in 2015 under then-manager Ange Postecoglou. Australia is a difficult team to rank because their Transfermarkt squad values would place them 71st in the world, while FIFA has them 26th in its official rankings. The breakout season from Antoine Semenyo at Bournemouth gives Ghana another attacking threat on the opposite flank from star man Mohammed Kudus. Qualifying rival Mali has underachieved thus far in their group, which leaves Ghana in first place, three points ahead of surprise package Comoros with four matches to play. Fact to know: Canadian manager Jesse Marsch is an American, and he often likes to remind the U.S. Soccer Federation of that You could make a case that Canada is actually the second-most talented North American squad from top to bottom, ahead of Mexico. They have a clear playing style and have fully adopted Marsch's high-intensity tactics, but I'm also not overreacting to Canada's run to the semifinal of the Copa América last year. Tunisia pulled off a shocking upset against France and tied Denmark at the last World Cup, but it still wasn't enough to advance because of a loss to Australia. There's not a ton of goal-scoring firepower in this squad, but it is an organized defensive outfit that has proved difficult to break down on the global stage. The last AFCON didn't go as planned, but this match will be a compelling test for them prior to next summer. Their most recent measuring-stick match was a 2-0 friendly defeat to Morocco. After a solid 2023 AFCON showing, Guinea has really underperformed in World Cup qualifying. Algeria is in first place with a three-point lead over Mozambique, and the two sides have no more head-to-head matchups left on the qualifying calendar. They have a handful of Big Five European league regulars and shouldn't be overlooked. Fact to know: Seven players on the current Egyptian squad play domestically for Al Ahly, who are in the Club World Cup this summer With the breakout season from Manchester City's Omar Marmoush, Egypt now has a secondary scoring option to add to Salah's production. The team needs both of its stars to be healthy to have any chance of reaching its potential because the depth otherwise is uninspiring. Fact to know: Since a shock quarterfinal run in 1990, Cameroon has been eliminated in the group stage of the last six World Cups it qualified for There are no top Champions League regulars in the squad, but they have enough depth to make noise next summer. Fact to know: Ivory Coast has the best goal difference of an African team in qualifying so far Bona fide legends Yaya Touré and Didier Drogba are no longer lacing their boots for the Ivory Coast, but there's still a lot of talent on this roster. This team doesn't have any major stars, but there are a lot of players at clubs in top-five leagues across Europe. That golden generation of Touré and Drogba never made a World Cup knockout stage, but this group will have a real chance to do that for the first time. If Lewandowski actually sits out, the team's chances of qualifying could be dicey. A 2-1 loss to Finland on Tuesday won't help their chances. Paraguay's collection of talent doesn't stand out in South America, and it didn't perform well in its Copa América group last summer, finishing last, behind Costa Rica, Colombia, and Brazil. Goal scoring has been an issue for them in past cycles, but the emergence of Enciso has given them a primary creator to focus their team around. Iran came up just short of advancing to the knockout stage in each of the last two World Cups, but it has gone toe-to-toe with the United States, Spain, and Portugal in past matchups. Iran feels like it's on the precipice of breaking through globally. The expanded format could finally get them a knockout game, but it's hard to see much more than that. Fact to know: El Tri has four players in Europe's top five leagues right now—Álvarez, Raúl Jiménez (Fulham), Santiago Giménez (AC Milan), and Johan Vásquez (Genoa) South Korea finished the Asian World Cup qualifiers unbeaten in 10 matches and will carry a wealth of talent from Europe's top five leagues to North America next summer. Son and Bayern's Kim-min Jae have been well-known European regulars for years now, and they will be looking to build on the late heroics that saw them reach the round of 16 at the last World Cup. The team's form under Mauricio Pochettino certainly hasn't been encouraging. The United States has shown clear regression since their quality round of 16 showing at the 2022 World Cup, and it's not obvious that the Americans have any real solutions for their lack of center back depth or goalkeeper issues. They'll be playing games at home, but is that even a huge advantage right now, given the general malaise of the national team? Is it possible for the Americans to gain some momentum between now and next June? Why can't the United States get Chris Richards, Malik Tillman, and Johnny Cardoso to replicate their quality club performances for the national team? Will goalkeeper Matt Turner be able to land a starting spot at the club level so that he can remain sharp heading into the World Cup? They are well on their way to qualification following a 3-0 demolition of Italy at home last week. Norway hasn't even been to the Euros since 2000, but they have a really talented core right now. It's not just those two powering the current squad, though. Norway starts four Premier League regulars, plus Borussia Dortmund right back Julian Ryerson and Atlético Madrid super sub Alexander Sørloth. Fact to know: Senegal is one of three African countries on this list, along with Morocco and Tunisia, that is expected to qualify for three consecutive World Cups Goal scoring has been an issue for Senegal throughout World Cup qualifying, as they have tallied just eight goals in six matches. The defense remains an excellent unit—it's allowed just one goal—but the team has registered a string of draws, putting it a point behind DR Congo in its qualifying group. This combination of attackers—Sadio Mané, Ismaila Sarr, Boulaye Dia, and Iliman Ndaiye—has goals in them, but there's a lack of creators to give them chances, which hurt Senegal in 2022 and could now put their chances of qualification in moderate danger. Fact to know: Italy lost to North Macedonia in a 2022 World Cup playoff match and missed the tournament as a result The Italians have two games in hand, but they are still nine points behind Norway and 12 goals behind them in goal difference. They equalized with Croatia in the final minute of a group stage match but were comfortably outplayed by Spain and knocked out by Switzerland in the round of 16. It seems like Italy should be happy to even just make the World Cup, and if they get in, it's hard to see them making a real run. Fact to know: Sweden's Euro 2024 qualifying play was such a disaster that they finished nine points behind Austria and 10 behind Belgium, failing to make the playoff round Sweden's Euros qualifying campaign was a calamity, but if you're simply looking at their squad on paper, they jump off the page as a really talented team. After failing to qualify for the 2022 World Cup and 2024 Euros, Sweden now has a lot of in-form club players. That means they'll probably go to the playoff, but they do have as much talent as anyone in that pool of competition. We saw the highs and lows of Türkiye in the Euros, where they lost sloppily to Portugal but beat Austria in a thriller. Consecutive dominant Nations League wins against Hungary in March portend well for a potential World Cup playoff. As always with Türkiye, the question is about defense. But with midfielders Guler and Hakan Calhanoglu and a bunch of intriguing attacking dribblers, they'll be a difficult team to beat, should they make the field. My Euro 2024 dark horse squad is back for another major tournament under manager Ralf Rangnick and his high-intensity pressing tactics. Their form has been a little less consistent in the Nations League since, but Rangnick generally has them performing above their talent level. They'll point to a 5-1 win against Norway in the Nations League to show that they remain a real threat in this second tier of European contenders. Bosnia and Herzegovina is off to a great start in the qualifying group, though, and is currently sitting in first, so there's work for Austria to do. Fact to know: It should come as no surprise that Luka Modric is Croatia's all-time leader in appearances, with 188 I thought that Croatia's aging core would be too old to run it back at the 2022 World Cup, and then they made it to the semifinals. Maybe the age of this squad finally caught up to them in the 2024 Euros, where they crashed out in the group stage, but they've given a good account of themselves in their Nations League matchups since then. During the group stage, Croatia beat Poland, drew with Portugal, and were generally competitive in each of their matches. Croatia thrashed current World Cup qualifying group leaders Czechia on Monday, 5-1, and are now the clear favorite to finish in first place, given that they have two games over the Czechs in hand. Fact to know: Christian Eriksen has appeared 143 times for Denmark, the most of any Dane in history Denmark hasn't yet begun their World Cup qualifying campaign, but they'll have to like their chances since they're in a group with Scotland, Belarus, and Greece. The Danes weren't particularly impressive at the 2024 Euros, with three draws in three games against Slovenia, England, and Serbia, but they showed that they remain a quality defensive outfit. Keep an eye out for the continued development and emergence of Brentford's Damsgaard. His creative production took a major leap in the Premier League last season, as he notched 10 assists—tied for fourth most in the league. Fact to know: Japan became the first non-hosting team to qualify for the 2026 World Cup when they beat Bahrain in March Japan still profiles as something of a scrappy, transitional team, but they'll be a pesky underdog against whichever top favorite they meet. But what if I told you that the second-best team—at least in World Cup qualifying—was actually Ecuador? Ecuador also came the closest to beating Argentina at the Copa Ámerica last year, when they lost to Emiliano Martinez in a penalty shoot-out. The Ecuadoreans aren't flashy or particularly impressive on paper. Bayer Leverkusen's Piero Hincapié, PSG's Willian Pacho, Chelsea's Caicedo, and Brighton's Pervis Estupiñán make up a really solid defensive core. Star man: Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City, for now, but probably Napoli soon) Fact to know: Romelu Lukaku has had 89 goals for Belgium in his career, which is more than double any other Belgian in history. De Bruyne's time as a Premier League star is likely coming to an end, but he's still one of the most creative and technically gifted passers in the world. The same is true for box-to-box midfielder Youri Tielemans. There will certainly be questions about how the Belgians will defend next summer—the top-level talent is lacking there—but a team with elite dribbler Jeremy Doku, De Bruyne, Tielemans, and the enigmatic Lukaku (who bagged 24 goal contributions in Serie A for title winner Napoli) will have no issues producing chances. Belgium was put in a pretty friendly qualifying group with North Macedonia, Wales, Kazakhstan, and Liechtenstein and should have no issues directly qualifying. Fact to know: Morocco made history by becoming the first African team to reach the semifinals of a World Cup in 2022 Still, Morocco's World Cup run is further proof that you don't need to dominate possessions to be successful in the international game, and having the ball is often overrated when analyzing team quality. With five wins in the first five qualifying matches, Morocco is on a path to comfortable qualification for the World Cup. Morocco is hosting AFCON 2025 in December, which will give African teams major preparation for the tournament. Fact to know: I'm still expecting Xherdan Shaqiri to show up and score his usual banger out of nowhere, but he has indeed retired from the national team Switzerland has been the pinnacle of consistency in past World Cups. Emerging winger Dan Ndoye and dynamite forward Breel Embolo provide the Swiss with a decent amount of attacking talent. They're not flashy or particularly impressive on paper, but Switzerland has always been a cohesive squad anchored by the still reliable Xhaka and Remo Freuler in midfield. Manchester City centerback Manuel Akanji gives them real pedigree on defense. Switzerland was placed in a competitive qualifying group with Sweden and Slovenia but will back themselves to finish in the top spot. After losing in the 2021 Copa Ámerica quarterfinals and following it up with a World Cup group stage exit in 2022, Uruguay brought on Marcelo Bielsa to help the proud footballing nation rediscover its identity. They lost a tightly contested Copa semifinal to Colombia last summer, but beating the United States and Brazil in that tournament was a step in the right direction. Uruguay's path through CONMEBOL qualifying has been more of a mixed bag. They began well but now have had just two wins in their 11 games since the Copa Ámerica. They have a ton of midfield quality and depth from Real Madrid's Valverde, Tottenham's Rodrigo Bentancur, and Manchester United's Manuel Ugarte, among others. It's a hardworking group that presses with relentless energy and defends well. Fact to know: James Rodríguez is second of all time in goals for Colombia, with 29, behind only Radamel Falcao After missing out on Qatar 2022, Colombia has been one of the best teams in international football for three years. Since that final, they've had a significant downturn in form. They're safe for now, but a loss at Venezuela in the final round of qualifying matches in September could see them fall to the inter-confederation playoff. Rodríguez can't run like he used to and plays club soccer in the relatively weak Mexican league, but he's still a superb dead-ball specialist, and he was the best player in the Copa Àmerica last summer. Fact to know: The Dutch have lost all three World Cup finals they've played in; they're the only nation to have reached three finals with no wins The Netherlands made it to the 2024 Euro semifinals even though their first-choice midfielders, Frenkie de Jong and Teun Koopmeiners, weren't available. Without those two, the Dutch struggled to control games. With those central midfielders now fit and attacking midfielders Tijjani Reijnders and Xavi Simons joining them in the lineup, the Dutch are a well-balanced team with a ton of defensive experience and enough attacking output to challenge the elite tier of contenders in the World Cup. Cody Gakpo has been good but not great in his time at Liverpool, but he's been a major international tournament star for the Dutch. The Dutch kicked off their qualifying campaign with a comfortable 2-0 win against Finland and are favorites to win their group and qualify directly. Fact to know: Brazil has made at least the quarterfinals in every World Cup since 1994 Don Carlo Ancelotti will be Brazil's fourth manager (including caretakers) of this World Cup cycle since Tite's departure after Qatar. It's easy to forget just how quickly everything turned for Brazil during and after the 2022 World Cup. When Neymar scored an incredible team goal in extra time against Croatia, that was supposed to set up a historic clash with Argentina in the semifinal. Brazil could probably field two different teams of players who'd be competitive in this World Cup, but it's not clear what the best 11 is. They've won just two of their last six in qualifying, and Vinicius Júnior and Raphina are the only locked-down starters among their main attackers. Fact to know: Former German striker Miroslav Klose holds the record for most goals scored in World Cup tournaments (16) Germany is spearheaded by two attacking midfield superstars, Jamal Musiala and Wirtz. The combination of Kai Havertz and Niclas Fullkrug up top was decent but not great last summer. Nagelsmann is an excellent tactician, and Germany has a sky-high ceiling. But the defense just conceded eight goals in four games against Italy (twice), Portugal, and France. Fact to know: Cristiano Ronaldo is Portugal's all-time leading goal scorer, with 138 goals. Even though they won the Nations League on Sunday in an Iberian clash with Spain, Portugal's future is uncertain. Will Cristiano Ronaldo be leading the line next summer, when he's 41? Ronaldo was detrimental to Portugal's performance in the 2024 Euros, but he's been productive in recent qualifying matches and scored the crucial equalizer on Sunday. It's a difficult decision because the squad has a lot of talented attacking players, but on the other hand … it's Ronaldo. Rumors have been flying that Roberto Martínez may not lead Portugal next summer, even though he delivered the trophy on Sunday. A new manager and tactical approach could unlock so much in this team, considering the passing range of Vitinha, Bernardo Silva, and Fernandes. They also have the rangy defending of Joao Neves, the left back marauding of Nuno Mendes, and a reliable goalkeeper in Diogo Costa. Based on its talent level, Portugal underperformed in the 2022 World Cup and 2024 Euros. They'll be back with one of the most stacked rosters again next summer, but there's a lot to iron out before then. It's a new era of English football under manager Thomas Tuchel. Or maybe it will just be more of the same. But it was easy to argue with the team's performances during his tenure. The emergence of Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly as a hyper-versatile left back could be key to fixing this issue. And will super-passer Trent Alexander-Arnold, fresh off a dream move to Real Madrid, now have a place on this team after the departure of Southgate, who never really favored him? Fact to know: France finished third in the 2025 UEFA Nations League, beating Germany on Sunday France made it to the semifinals at the 2024 Euros but was still one of the most disappointing teams: They scored only four total goals across six games—and three of them were either own goals and penalties. In the Nations League semifinal, France started a front four of Mbappé, Désiré Doué, Michael Olise, and Ousmane Dembélé. Yet France trailed 5-1 at one point in the second half. Les Bleus will enter next year's World Cup as one of the favorites because, despite their recent struggles, they have an overwhelming amount of talent at both scoring goals and defending. They should have no issues qualifying in a UEFA group with Iceland, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan, and it would surprise no one to see them lift the trophy next summer. But there is plenty to watch for between now and next June. Argentina didn't just win the 2022 World Cup final against France but bookended that historic triumph with Copa Ámerica titles in both 2021 and 2024. Argentina is currently 10 points clear of second place in the CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers, and they've beaten Brazil both home and away en route to a comfortable qualification. South America used to be Brazil, Argentina, and everyone else. They won without a ton of contributions from him at the 2024 Copa, but their creative output did suffer as a result. Fact to know: Spain has had seven penalty shoot-outs since the 2018 World Cup and lost four of them, including in Sunday's Nations League final against Portugal Spain was inarguably the best team at the 2024 Euros, winning all seven matches and beating heavyweights like Germany, France, England, Italy, and Croatia. Spain also beat France in a 5-4 thriller in the recent Nations League semifinal, and while they ended up losing the final to Portugal in a penalty shoot-out, they remain the top team on this list. The arrow for Spain continues to point upward, boosted by its ever-reliable midfield and dynamic young wingers. Mikel Oyarzabal isn't the most traditional striker option, but he's been a solid goal scorer and creator for Spain, notching three goals and two assists in the final four matches of the Nations League. It's a loaded roster with depth and superstar talent that should enter as the favorite.</p>

Preparations are now underway for the Club World Cup, which for us begins on Monday with a match against LAFC in Atlanta, with those players not involved on international duty returning from holidays and back to training at Cobham. The squad will fly out to the USA only on Friday, and it's only then that we will know exactly who all will be traveling — at least for the group stage; we will get to make changes to the squad if (when) we get to the knockout stages. But it sounds like we will be making minimal changes to the squad, and according to The Telegraph, only Andrey Santos will be added from among those who finished last season out on loan. So that means the likes of João Félix, Renato Veiga, Axel Disasi, Raheem Sterling, Ben Chilwell, Armando Broja, Alfie Gilchrist, and many others will not be involved. While part of that decision is surely to try to keep the squad size manageable, part of that is also a judgement on their futures (thus the inclusion of Santos). EXCL: Goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic has not been included in Chelsea's Club World Cup squad. Chelsea have decided not to take any players who spent the season out on loan - other than Andrey Santos - as they see the CWC as a continuation of 24/25 campaign #cfc… Perhaps most notably, Đorđe Petrović is expected to be left out as well, despite some rumors (hope?) that he will get a proper shot at the Chelsea goalkeeper job for next season. Young Mike Penders is set to make up our numbers after the exit of Marcus Bettinelli. Penders, like fellow new signings Liam Delap, Dário Essugo, and Mamadou Sarr, and unlike most of our loanees, is set to travel. One new signing who is not expected to join is Kendry Páez, who's apparently already earmarked for a Strasbourg loan. But we'll have to wait and see what the final list looks like on Friday. Player was expecting to go to the Club World Cup last week and then have his future decided. #CFC have determined he is not part of their squad, with a Strasbourg loan anticipated.
