As MCA continues to fine-tune its Nashville operation under new president/CEO Mike Harris, the company has laid off nearly 20 employees in a round of staff cuts across multiple departments. Representatives for MCA and parent company Universal Music Group (UMG) either didn't respond to a request for comment or declined to comment, but sources say the new MCA will operate as a smaller, more focused unit than the former iteration of the label previously known at UMG Nashville did under former chairman/CEO Cindy Mabe, who was let go in January. During her two-year tenure, Mabe greatly expanded UMG Nashville, including launching a comedy imprint, Capitol Comedy Network, as well a distribution and independent artist services arm, Silver Wings Records, and a TV and film production company called Sing Me Back Home Productions. She also moved the company into live production by partnering with Cirque du Soleil to present Songblazers: A Journey into Country Music. Harris, who was named president/CEO in February, will work alongside chief creative officer Dave Cobb and Rob Femia, who added COO to his duties as executive vp of business and legal affairs earlier this month, as well as executive vp/GM Katie McCartney. In April, Los Angeles-based Interscope Geffen A&M (IGA) Records announced the relaunch of the iconic Lost Highway imprint, which had previously been part of UMG Nashville until 2012, when it went dormant (though Mabe had reactivated it with producer T Bone Burnett right after Former Thirty Tigers executive Robert Knotts and Universal Music Group Nashville (UMGN) executive Jake Gear will serve as co-heads and executive vps of the resurrected label. In May, former Big Loud executive Candice Watkins was named president of Capitol Records Nashville and executive vp of Capitol Christian Music Group. MCA's imprints include EMI Records Nashville, Lucille Records, Mercury Nashville and MCA Nashville, representing artists including Eric Church, Keith Urban, Carrie Underwood, Chris Stapleton, Dierks Bentley, Alan Jackson and Little Big Town.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The devastating news that Brian Wilson has died at age 82 hit early Wednesday afternoon, and we're all in a state of shock. Wilson had been in failing health for quite a long time, and the family revealed he was suffering from dementia last year, requiring a conservatorship to handle his affairs. He was one of rock & roll's ultimate survivors, somehow outliving both of his brothers, Carl and Dennis, by more than a quarter-century. “We really wanted to do the music justice,” Wondermints multi-instrumentalist Probyn Gregory told Rolling Stone in 2024. A couple of years into the run, they started playing Pet Sounds straight through with local symphonies. It was a peak moment that was impossible to top, but Wilson and the Wondermints continued to tour heavily practically every single year throughout the 2010s and early 2020s, pausing only for the brief Beach Boys reunion in 2012, and Covid in 2020. It was a difficult time for Wilson, who often seemed distant and unengaged onstage, leaving his band — including original Beach Boy Al Jardine — to carry much of the weight. “It was a little tough,” Gregory told Rolling Stone. “We've seen that over the years, that sometimes he's really pumped and all there and ready to do a show. But when he's not engaged, it can seem really bad. The last show took place July 26, 2022, at Pine Knob Music Theatre in Clarkson, Michigan. Like every show on the tour, it was heavy on Beach Boys classics like “God Only Knows,” “Good Vibrations” and “Sloop John B.” But there were also deeper cuts, including “Long Promised Road,” “Sail On, Sailor,” and “Wild Honey.” Brian Wilson, Beach Boys Co-Founder and Architect of Pop, Dead at 82 ‘No Kings': Millions to Protest Trump's ‘Dictator-Style Birthday Parade' Check out fan-shot footage of “California Girls,” “Good Vibrations,” and several other songs from the show. It's sad on some level, since Wilson is clearly struggling, and he barely participates in “Good Vibrations.” But take a look at at the joyous crowd perched near the stage, singing along to every word of those all-time classic songs and having a blast. Brian was dealt many difficult hands in life, including a brutish father and severe mental illness. But he spent the last few decades of his life watching music that he created spark joy in thousands of people, night after night. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

However, this time, it's because he said his dad didn't go to his grandma's funeral so that he could attend a fashion show. “This man is so hungry for fame it's pathetic. “You're the lamest man to ever walk planet Earth. Honestly embarrassed to ever have considered you my idol.” Trace continued, “The best thing to come from your downfall is it made me go into beast mode. In January, Trace posted an open letter on Instagram calling for help for his dad after Billy Ray's performance at President Trump's inauguration went viral as there were many audio technical difficulties that Billy Ray appeared to have a hostile reaction to. However, after he did so, Trace said Billy Ray threatened him with legal action. You should be ashamed of yourself,” Trace said. A rep for Billy Ray declined to comment.

Jamie Lee Curtis supported her trans daughter Ruby in 2023 by saying her “Everything Everywhere All at Once” Oscar is part of the push to have genderless awards categories, much like what the Gothams pioneered. She previously had addressed non-gendered awards categories while backstage at the 2023 Oscars. “The bigger question is how do you include everyone when there are binary choices, which is very difficult, and as the mother of a trans daughter, I completely understand that,” Curtis said. “And yet to de-gender the categories, I'm concerned that will diminish the opportunities for more women, which is something I've been working hard to promote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We are heartbroken to announce that our beloved father Brian Wilson has passed away. Wilson's family did not provide a cause of death, but it was revealed in February 2024 that the Beach Boys legend was battling dementia. He was a sweet, gentle soul as well as fierce competitor,” Wilson's longtime manager Jean Sievers said in a statement to Rolling Stone. God truly broke the mold when he created Brian Wilson. Besides being a creative genius, he was one the smartest and funniest people I've ever known. Wilson's legacy includes dozens of hit singles with the Beach Boys, including three Number One singles (“I Get Around,” “Help Me, Rhonda,” and “Good Vibrations”). And on albums such as Pet Sounds, Wilson's lavish, orchestral production techniques dramatically expanded the sonic palette of rock & roll and showed how the recording studio could be an instrument by itself. Born June 20, 1942, Brian Wilson grew up in Hawthorne, California, a modest town next to the Los Angeles Airport. Their father, Murry, was an aspiring songwriter and a tyrant. “Although he saw himself as a loving father who guided his brood with a firm hand, he abused us psychologically and physically, creating wounds that never healed,” Wilson wrote in his 1991 autobiography, Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story. Wilson grew up playing sports and obsessing over music, teaching his brothers to harmonize with him. Signed to Capitol Records and named the Beach Boys, they started to roll out hits like convertible Thunderbirds coming off an assembly line: “Surfin' U.S.A.” (with music borrowed from Chuck Berry's “Sweet Little Sixteen”), “Surfer Girl,” “Be True to Your School,” “Fun, Fun, Fun.” Those Brian Wilson compositions all sounded like insanely catchy jingles for the California teenage lifestyle — surfboards, hamburger stands, pep rallies — but on the flip side of the good times was a real sense of melancholy. Wilson got more ambitious in his songwriting and experimented with new sounds—like the chunky surf guitar and falsetto lead on “I Get Around.” But he buckled under the stress of touring, having a nervous breakdown on the road in Europe in 1964. Questlove, Clairo, Earthgang, and More Remember Sly Stone: He ‘Was a Giant' Billy Jones, Baby's All Right Owner and Key Player in New York Music Scene, Dead at 45 Paul McCartney frequently cited Pet Sounds as a masterpiece, giving it particular credit for its innovative bass playing, and has called the aching “God Only Knows” his favorite song of all time. The album was orchestrated with instruments that included harpsichords, bicycle bells, and barking dogs. The culmination was “Wouldn't It Be Nice,” with its lyrics yearning for an adult life and love. The other Beach Boys, particularly Mike Love, were not impressed by Pet Sounds, and Wilson considered releasing it as a solo record; as a Beach Boys album, it was only a middling success in the States, although its influence was huge and it was recognized as an instant classic in the U.K. Wilson followed up with the Beach Boys' finest single, “Good Vibrations,” three-and-a-half thrilling minutes of electro-theremin and stacks of vocals, recorded over a period of six months in various studios at a cost that was reportedly, at that point, the most expensive single in history. Wilson returned to the studio with plans to top himself: an album called Smile, which he told friends would be a “teenage symphony to God.” Working with lyricist Van Dyke Parks, he started to assemble an elaborate collection of musical suites, intended to change the face of popular music, but the sessions fell apart, weighed down by the indifference of the other Beach Boys, Wilson's consumption of pot and LSD, and his growing mental instability. Wilson spent most of the next decade in his Bel Air mansion, which included both a recording studio and a sandbox in the living room (he put his piano in it so he could feel sand between his toes when he played). The Beach Boys continued without Brian Wilson; even as their album sales evaporated, they remained a popular oldies-oriented touring act. In 1988, Wilson hesitantly stepped back into the public eye and started releasing solo albums, beginning with the cult masterpiece Brian Wilson, which had a executive producer credit for Wilson's longtime therapist, Dr. Eugene Landy (who later had lost his license to practice therapy). It was outpaced commercially by Wilson's daughters, Carnie and Wendy, who formed two-thirds of Wilson Phillips, a vocal trio that sold ten million copies of their 1990 debut album. Wilson performed with his daughters on 1995's I Just Wasn't Made for These Times. That same year he released Orange Crate Art, an collaboration with Van Dyke Parks. Although songs, including “Heroes and Villains” and “Surf's Up,” had made their way piecemeal onto Beach Boys albums, it was generally assumed that it was impossible to piece together the shards of Wilson's masterpiece. In 2004, however, against all odds, Wilson completed the album; in a five-star review, Rolling Stone said it was “beautiful and funny, goofily grand.” Wilson had found his way to something that once seemed impossible: a happy ending. Trump Announces Plan to Honor a Bunch of Confederate Military Leaders In February 2024, just weeks after the death of Brian's second wife and longtime manager, Melinda, Brian's family revealed that the singer was suffering from dementia, and a conservatorship was sought to secure his continued care. “Brian will be able to enjoy all of his family and friends and continue to work on current projects as well as participate in any activities he chooses.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Piracy is piracy," says Disney's chief legal officer, as the studios aim to show that tools allowing personalized AI slop creations of characters like Darth Vader or Shrek run afoul of their IP. In the next chapter of Big Entertainment vs. Big Tech, Disney and Universal have filed a lawsuit against artificial intelligence company Midjourney over tools that allow users to create images and videos that can manipulate famous characters at the click of a prompt. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday by Disney Enterprises, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century, Universal City Studios Productions and DreamWorks Animation, describes the David Holz-run generative AI firm Midjourney as a “bottomless pit of plagiarism.” So far, Wall Street has bet big that AI will be a major economic driver in the future and AI companies have raised tens of billions of dollars to realize that vision. Notably, major film and TV studios have not yet inked significant deals with AI companies to license their IP to these tech giants' tools that are now used by millions of users. (The New York Times is an exception, and it has spent $10 million-plus fighting OpenAI so far.) This is commonly called “AI Slop,” and many likely already see it in their social media feeds. The complaint offers AI-generated images of Vader, Wall-E, Stormtroopers, How to Train Your Dragon characters, Minions and Shrek and many more as evidence of copyright infringement perpetuated by Midjourney. And it singles out Star Wars character Yoda with a side-by-side comparison: The Hollywood studios go on to allege that Midjourney is able to provide such outputs because its tools have already ingested copyrighted intellectual property across the web as training data. The studios also claim that Midjourney then “cleaned” and converted digital files of copyrighted intellectual property to use in its training data so that its tools could then provide outputs allowing users to create things like personalized Yoda, Vader or Shrek images. But the MPA, so far, has mostly gone after websites that show unauthorized movies and TV shows, not AI companies, despite the prevalence of users flocking to AI-powered tools. “Our world-class IP is built on decades of financial investment, creativity and innovation—investments only made possible by the incentives embodied in copyright law that give creators the exclusive right to profit from their works,” stated Disney general counsel Horacio Gutierrez. “We are bullish on the promise of AI technology and optimistic about how it can be used responsibly as a tool to further human creativity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sabrina Carpenter‘s break between her last album and next LP was short and sweet, with the pop star announcing Wednesday (June 11) that she has another full-length titled Man's Best Friend coming out this summer. Sharing the news on Instagram, Carpenter unveiled the project's sensual cover art — a photo of the Grammy winner down on her knees in black stilettos, held in place by a man gripping a fistful of her hair — and revealed that it will arrive Aug. 29. “i can't wait for it to be yours x,” she added in her caption. According to its Spotify countdown page, Man's Best Friend will feature 12 tracks, including lead single “Manchild,” which recently dropped and is gunning for a high debut on the Billboard Hot 100. The country-tinged track — co-written and produced alongside Carpenter's Short n' Sweet collaborators Jack Antonoff and Amy Allen — finds the Girl Meets World alum playfully calling out incompetent men. “Manchild, why you always come a-running to me?/ F–k my life, won't you let an innocent woman be?” she sings on the song. “Never heard of self-care/ Half your brain just ain't there.” Man's Best Friend comes close on the heels of Carpenter's breakthrough album Short n' Sweet, which dropped last August and propelled the singer to superstar status through Billboard Hot 100 top 10 singles “Espresso” and “Taste.” The LP marked her first-ever No. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix is turning to a French icon for its latest feature film. Vincent Cassel (La Haine) has been cast in the titular role. Jean-Francois Richet (Plane) is set to direct a script penned by Eric Besnard (Wrath of Man). Mediawan's Radar Films is housing the feature, with Clément Miserez and Matthieu Warter producing. Cassel, who is no stranger to starring in screen adaptations of French classics after appearing in Asterix & Obelix: The Middle Kingdom, will embody a character that has a long association with the big screen. Quasimodo was depicted by Anthony Hopkins in 1982's The Hunchback of Notre Dame, while Tom Hulce voiced the role in Disney's 1996 animation. Netflix will get cameras rolling on Quasimodo this summer in France. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kim Zolciak and Kroy Biermann have finally exited the Georgia mansion that was the backdrop for numerous fights and police calls. According to Page Six, the US Marshals intervened and removed them from the home on April 8, 2025. As per a court filing, four deputy marshals “ejected” Zolciak and Biermann from the Atlanta mansion from 3:30 p.m. to 6:45 p.m. The former reality star and the ex-NFL player finally sold their mansion in February 2025 for $2.75 million — $3 million less than the original asking price — after it was on the market for a year and a half. According to Page Six, Kroy Biermann filed for divorce from Kim in the summer of 2023, and now that the issues with their Georgia mansion have been resolved, the exes are finally able to focus on what they hope is a positive future. Kim has relocated to a rental property with their four minor children: Kroy Jr. (also known as KJ), 14, Kash, 12, and 11-year-old twins Kaia and Kane. They also share daughters Brielle, 28, and Ariana, 23, whom Biermann adopted back in 2012. According to Ariana Biermann, Kroy has stepped away from the drama and is living a quiet life by himself. The ex-reality star has also undergone a serious career change. He now oversees logistics and helps with improving workplace efficiency at Superior Rigging and Erecting Co.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Most of the characters in this decidedly grounded Australian prison drama are too young — and too many worlds removed — to know who Barry Manilow is, let alone guess his identity based on a handful of factoids. Not because they're human, and we have the natural grace to extend these murderers the courtesy of that recognition, but rather because this film wouldn't have any reason to exist if the answer to any of those questions was “no.” The abundant power of Williams' debut feature — which stems from his experience growing up in an economically dispossessed Victoria town whose jail was like a second home for several of the men in his family — is rooted in the fact that “Inside” never pretends otherwise. This is not a story that labors to earn its prisoners their humanity. On the contrary, it's a story about how their clear and inextinguishable humanity is liable to become a prison unto itself. In the borrowed words of long-time inmate Warren Murfett (a bushy and brilliant Guy Pearce): “The worst of men have a little bit of good in them, and that'll be their undoing.” Warren is quoting another inmate at the same time as he's mocking the way that some of his fellow convicts try to protect themselves with aphorisms, but some pearls of wisdom are worth carrying around in your pocket like a shiv at the ready. For a man with blood on his hands like Warren, it's that last mote of humanity that might prove to be his doom — the stubborn part of himself that still yearns for redemption, hopes for healing, and strives to make something more of himself before there's nothing left. It's the part of himself that 17-year-old Mel Blight (puppy-eyed newcomer Vincent Miller, wrenchingly credible in his first movie role) is already trying to stamp out by the time Williams' film begins to take shape around him. In his opening voiceover, which floats above the sort of glassy synth music that's meant to numb our judgment, Mel informs us that he was conceived during a conjugal visit when his father was in prison, and that his dad once told him that he was destined to wind up back behind bars. “And he was right.” A broken home gave way to juvenile detention, and the violence that followed him there saw Mel transferred to general population — not unheard of in a country where kids as young as 10 can be locked away indefinitely. Now that he's inching toward parole, Mel's doing everything in his power to fuck it up. No one does, especially inside.” By “inside” he means prison, but Williams' delicate script obviously intends for us to recognize that he means inside himself as well. If this film is able to afford such an explicit double entendre, that's because of how truthfully it grapples with the nuances of rehabilitation — with the crooked path these men are meant to walk from sin to salvation, and with the practical realities of returning to a world that may no longer have a place for them in it. “There's something broken inside of us,” he writes in one of his letters, and it's easier for him to own that spiritual dysfunction than to risk the heartache of failing to overcome it. The target's name is Mark Shepard (a slack-jawed Cosmo Jarvis, who continues to be one of the most gifted chameleons in modern cinema), he became a national sensation when he was convicted for the rape and murder of a young girl when he was only 13 years old himself, and — after earning a transfer out of maximum security — he happens to be Mel's new cellmate. What separates Mark from the other two characters in this movie's core triangle is that he's evangelically convinced of his own absolution, to the point that he delivers Pentecostal sermons to the world's most hostile congregation. Of course, Mel's dilemma isn't so black-and-white, especially because offing a “monster” of Mark's caliber might be the shortest possible route to getting right with God. “Inside” eventually builds to a clear moment of choice for the sake of its own climax, but the vast majority of this movie is spent complicating its characters' logic rather than framing their choices as some moral binary. Not only do Williams and Jarvis conspire to rescue a mottled innocence from the recesses of Mark's tortured mind (a process that hinges on a truly shocking reveal), but Pearce's layered and wrenchingly humane performance eventually reveals Warren to be the heart of the film. That isn't because Warren evolves from the diabolical manipulator that he seems to be at the start of this story, but rather because we bear witness to how the character reframes himself as his greatest mark. He might tell Mel that breaking their cycles of violence is as foolish as thinking a different song might come on when you replay a tape, but some of his actions suggest otherwise, and the surrogate father role Warren assumes while coaching Mel towards another murder starts to affect the older man after he suffers a disastrous visit with his actual son during a brief furlough (“Babyteeth” breakout Toby Wallace is outstanding in the crucial one-scene role). The Joker-like shot of Warren sticking his head out of a car window on the way back to jail, his beard blasting against his face in the wind, is an unforgettably poignant snapshot of a man who's free from everything but himself. “Inside” is a small and constrained prison drama, even by the inflexible standards of its genre, and yet Williams' debut is so replete with such moments of raw compassion that it almost invisibly accumulates a deep well of emotion — one that allows the film to feel much bigger than it looks by the time it arrives at its absolute knockout of a final scene. “Who Am I?” is a mystery that none of these characters may ever be able to solve for themselves, at least not with the certainty of a trivia game on the back of a candy wrapper, but to watch them look for the answers in each other is enough to convince us that the question is always worth asking.

During an acting career that spanned eight decades, Robinson worked alongside Burt Lancaster in The Young Savages (1961) and Birdman of Alcatraz (1962), both directed by John Frankenheimer, and with Addams Family icon Ted Cassidy in four films, all of which he directed. Jonathan Mayers, Concert Promoter and Bonnaroo Co-Founder, Dies at 51 The Florida native also starred as Vietnam vet Tim Ochopee, a Seminole with a pet rattlesnake who obeys his commands (for most of the movie, anyway), in the Everglades-set horror film Stanley (1972), from Crown International Pictures. On ABC's General Hospital, he portrayed Dr. Rick Webber (two-time husband of Denise Alexander‘s Lesley and adoptive father of Genie Francis' Laura) from 1978-86. He came back in 2002, only to have his character bludgeoned to death with a candlestick by Scotty Baldwin (Kin Shriner), Laura's former husband. Robinson also played Jack Hamilton, who enjoyed romances with Stephanie Douglas (Susan Flannery) and her rival Sally Spectra (Darlene Conley), on CBS' The Bold and the Beautiful from 1992-2002, with a final appearance in 2005. But when he encountered legal trouble related to income tax evasion, he was replaced by Peter Bergman, another TV doctor on another soap (All My Children). Two years later, he played a teenage thug in The Diary of a High School Bride and the spider-like monster in Gene Corman's Beast From Haunted Cave, wearing a costume he had designed. Robinson stayed busy after that, guest-starring on such series as Colt. 45, Hennesey, The Donna Reed Show, Sea Hunt, Death Valley Days, Ben Casey, Gunsmoke, Wagon Train and The Fugitive before landing on 12 O'Clock High. He starred as an albino slave who is on the run with his brother (Anthony Scott) from a plantation owner (Cassidy) in Catch the Black Sunshine (1974), which he also wrote and directed, then did similar triple duty on Thunder County (1974), The Intruder (1975) and The Great Balloon Race (1977). Talking about The Intruder — which also featured Mickey Rooney and Yvonne De Carlo — in a 2017 interview with Nick Thomas, Robinson said he cast it, put the crew together and shot it in a mere six weeks. Asked what became of the movie, Robinson replied: “I have no idea. I moved on to other projects and just forgot about it.” Robinson's big-screen résumé also included Because They're Young (1960), The Long Rope (1961), Shootout at Big Sag (1962), Lady in Cement (1968), The Cycle Savages (1969), The Hawaiians (1970), Revenge Is My Destiny (1971), Amy (1981), Savannah Smiles (1982) and Just for a Week (2022).

His son Chris opened a window into the family by producing and directing two documentary shorts: Bankrupt by Beanies (2009), about his dad buying many thousands of Beanie Baby plush toys with the goal of reselling them at a profit, and Bastard: An Illegitimate Film (2010), which explored his “complicated” family tree (his father had his nine kids with six women). “No matter how we came to be, all of us are connected,” Chris, talking about his siblings and half-siblings, said in closing the documentary. “And when our father is gone, even as some of us don't even consider him to be their father, we'll still have each other to look to for love and support.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tarek and Heather El Moussa's recent trip to Las Vegas was one big, happy family getaway, according to a social media post the HGTV stars shared on June 6, 2025. In the photos and videos Heather posted of the time spent with their parents, there was no mention of any drama. But on June 10, TMZ reported that Tarek, 43, was cited for battery by Las Vegas police during the trip, after getting into a physical altercation with a man at The Palazzo at the Venetian Resort. Sources say he was sticking up for his 77-year-old dad. A post shared by Heather Rae El Moussa (@theheatherraeelmoussa) On June 5, per TMZ, law enforcement got involved when Tarek and another male got into an altercation at the Venetian. People magazine later reported that the fight occurred when a man allegedly began harassing Tarek's dad. El Moussa received a citation for battery from Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officers, but was not arrested, and neither man requested medical assistance, the outlet said. and made it extra special by bringing our parents along for the ride. Grateful for these moments that we get to spend together.” On June 9, Tarek shared multiple videos in his Instagram Stories of himself at Target buying toys for his boys — two-year-old Tristan, whom he shares with Heather, and 10-year-old Brayden, whom he shares with first wife Christina Haack — as well as playing at a playground with them and doing trying virtual reality experience with Brayden. “Recap of boys weekend…” he wrote, while Heather was away on a girls' trip,. Though they later divorced, both have continued to be deeply involved in Tarek's life. His mom has appeared on his HGTV shows, including on “The Flip Off” in early 2025, and frequently appears in his and Heather's social media posts as a doting mom and grandma. In 2017, Tarek celebrated his dad's 70th birthday by posting a family photo on Facebook and writing, “Happy 70th old man!!! The relationship between a father and his children is so important. I was lucky enough to have a supportive and motivating father that made me believe I could accomplish anything in the world. For Father's Day in 2022, Tarek shared an Instagram photo of himself with his dad and sister, Angelique, and wrote, “I never realized how important a good dad was until later in my life. Looking back, I realize I've found so much of my success through the lessons my dad taught me growing up. He always taught me the importance of working hard and building one's confidence.</p>
