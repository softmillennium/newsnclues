                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled the Trump administration's openness on Wednesday to extending President Donald Trump's current 90-day tariff pause beyond July 9 for the United States' top trading partners, as long as they show "good faith" in ongoing trade negotiations. The U.S. has 18 "important trading partners," Bessent said at a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee in Washington. The Trump administration, he said, is "working toward deals" with those countries. "It is highly likely," said Bessent, that for those countries and trading blocs, like the European Union, "who are negotiating in good faith," the United States would "roll the date forward to continue good faith negotiations." "If someone is not negotiating, then we will not," he told the House's tax writing committee. Until now, Trump administration officials have not suggested that they are open to moving back the 90-day tariff pause without at least "terms of an agreement" before the pause expires. Bessent's remarks indicate that the Trump administration might be more inclined to shift the self-imposed deadline as it gets closer. President Donald Trump's 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, announced on April 9, is set to end in less than a month. Trump officials have repeatedly said that they are close to inking trade deals with half a dozen countries. But so far, the White House has only announced a formal trade agreement with the United Kingdom and a framework agreement with China.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump declared the trade war with China "done" on Wednesday, while his Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said tariffs on Chinese goods will be locked in at the current 55% rate without additional increases. Alan Baer, CEO of logistics firm OL USA, said the existing 55% tariff on Chinese goods will put hundreds, if not thousands, of companies and ultimately jobs at risk. This is the minimum rate being paid by US shippers. US importers tell CNBC the rate is still way too high to resume full orders. "A 55% tariff from China will substantially cause instability for consumer goods companies that are bringing goods in from China," said Bruce Kaminstein, a member of NY Angels and founder and former CEO of cleaning products company Casabella. "President Trump recently said he doesn't want to make t-shirts? The latest national inflation data released on Wednesday showed a smaller than expected increase in prices, though it is expected to remain volatile with tariffs policy uncertainty remaining. Kaminstein said with most companies working on a 40-60% percent gross margin, this will cause either substantial price increases or substantial cutting of expenses to survive, adding stress to the cash flow of these companies. "A reported 55% tariff on our largest supplier of American apparel and footwear, stacked on top of already high MFN and Section 301 rates is not a win for America," said Steve Lamar, CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. "We're closely watching for more details, but the reality is this: nearly all clothes and shoes sold in the U.S. are now subject to elevated tariff rates. These costs will hit American families hard, especially as they get ready for back-to-school shopping and the holiday season. New trade deals that bring lower tariffs can't come soon enough." The tariff uncertainty is also weighing on EU exports bound for the U.S. On Wednesday, Lutnick said an EU trade deal would likely come last, partially due to the need to deal with a bloc of countries rather than a single government. The current situation leaves freight carriers focused on U.S.-EU trade concerned. "The transatlantic trade has seen an increase in cargo volume in both directions during the last month, averaging 15% compared to last year" said Abbott. As a result, Abbott said many companies are choosing the "wait and see" strategy ahead of any deal being made. The trade headlines and concerns come ahead of an expected increase in orders in July and August, peak season for when containers are scheduled to arrive for the holiday shopping season. But logistics experts say there will be no Covid-level surges at U.S. ports. "Companies pulled in freight to get out of the tariff crosshairs in March, April, and May," said Dean Croke, DAT Freight & Analytics principal analyst. We are essentially in peak season now," he added. The first customers to take advantage of the tariff pause window were those with time-sensitive cargo, like medical supplies and high-value cargo, like automotive parts, luxury furniture, and fashion, according to Mike Short, president of global forwarding for CH Robinson. Robinson, told CNBC that when he was visiting one of its biggest retail customers last week, "I was only sort of surprised to see jack-o'-lantern dinner plates in their distribution center already." "We're four months out and already moving Halloween items to be ready for store delivery the next day. We're seeing the same thing in our retail consolidation centers, where we're pulling in seasonal and holiday freight from multiple retail suppliers. This is a combination of carryover inventory from last year and freight front-loaded in Q1 to avoid the higher tariffs that were coming in April," Hoffman said. After the U.S. agreed to a pause in the trade war with China, plans were made for shipping that will result in "a busy four-week period this summer," Croke said. "Domestically, we might be moving some of that freight in late June and into July. So, shoppers may have fewer back-to-school items to choose from, but at this point, glow-in-the-dark skeletons and fake vampire teeth will probably make it," he added. The trucking industry, in particular, is facing a variety of challenges. "I think the damage is done this year," Croke said. The supply chain will not recover until these trade deals are done. You have to expect the worst-case scenario, and anything better than that is an upside. I don't see how the market recovers," he added. Both the rail and trucking industries make their profits in moving containers. Historically, cargo volume has been an early U.S. consumer demand prediction tool. The National Retail Federation's forecast, based on orders and container analysis for June through October's holiday shipping season, is down 14% year over year. Jon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation, said once a deal is signed, the tariff rate on China will be critical for business decisions. "We look forward to getting more information from the administration. However, agreeing to a 55% tariff that maintains the current IEEPA, fentanyl, and Section 301 tariffs is still extremely high, particularly for small businesses that continue to struggle with the current tariffs," said Gold. Manufacturing out of Asia fell to a 17-month low, according to the latest GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index, a leading indicator tracking demand conditions, shortages, transportation costs, inventories, and backlogs, based on a monthly survey of 27,000 businesses. Another leading indicator warning of a decrease in manufacturing orders and leaner holiday inventories is empty ocean freight containers. In ITS Logistics' June U.S. Port/Rail Ramp Freight Index, empty container return issues persisted at the nation's busiest ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, "Empty container buildup continues despite higher outbound empties; congestion challenges remain," the report stated. CH Robinson expected softer conditions to persist at the Port of LA and Long Beach, with volume to rise month-over-month in early June, but remain lower than this time last year. According to North American port data analysis from ITS Logistics, the terminals which process the containers at ports nationally are running at 60-75% capacity. The U.S. export market will also continue to experience challenging conditions due to limited vessels after a pullback in sailings by ocean freight companies. At the Port of New York, a surplus of empty containers is a result of New York port terminals restricting returns and limiting some export bookings to free up vessel space and improve flow. "Ongoing blank sailings have hindered carriers' ability to reposition equipment efficiently. With limited vessel calls and mounting backlogs, this imbalance is expected to persist in the weeks ahead," C.H. At Gulf Coast ports, tariff-related demand shifts and blank sailings significantly reduced the volume of incoming containers. "As a result, exporters should expect tightening container availability, particularly at inland rail ramps and U.S. Gulf Coast ports such as Houston, starting in July or August," C.H. During Covid, the transport of empty containers back to China took precedence over U.S. exports. Manufacturers in China and Asia needed those containers so they could fill them with products quickly to keep up with the tremendous U.S. consumer demand. "With the significant reduction in vessels calling LA/LB due to the tariff activity, we are seeing significant increases in empty container dwell outside of the terminals," said Paul Brashier, vice president of global supply chain at ITS Logistics. "It is getting very difficult to find locations to terminate empties and in addition many ocean carriers are implementing laborious termination policies not seem since the post- Covid era." The UK tariff pause resulted in the restoration of more "normal" volume in that market, Abbott said, and the fear of an EU tariff pause ending in July fueled the increased EU shipments as manufacturers stocked shelves a bit more in case a UK-type deal for the EU, and deal on steel and aluminum tariffs, are not agreed to in a way that favors greater trade.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Samuel Tombs, Chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, sees a labor market struggling with softening hiring and an accelerating trend of downward revisions. In May, 139,000 jobs were added, beating the 125,000 consensus estimate, but that was overshadowed somewhat by sharp revisions to prior months' data. March's initial figure of 224,000 payrolls added has since been nearly slashed in half, down to 120,000. It's likely that May's figure is inflated, too, Tombs said. "We expect May's number to be revised down to about 100,000 by the third estimate, published in early August," Tombs wrote in a recent note. Since January 2023, downward revisions between the intial and third estimates for each month have averaged 30,000. The frequency of downward revisions could be due to reporting by small businesses filing payroll data late, Tombs said. Smaller companies are often hit the hardest by high interest rates and tariff costs. Tombs sees continued weakness in the retail, wholesale, and transport and logistics sectors, and expects employment in those parts of the economy to fall by 50,000 by year-end due to a reduction in the "pull-forward effect" from tariffs, which saw many businesses and consumers rush to spend money ahead of tariff-related price hikes. On top of the revisions, hiring also appeared poised to slow. The NFIB small business hiring intentions index slipped to its lowest level since May 2020, and regional Fed surveys suggest continued declines in service-sector employment outside healthcare and education. Tombs believes government jobs will also continue to decline after their DOGE gutting as federal employees who accepted a voluntary buyout get removed from the payroll in September — they've fallen by 59,000 this year, including by 22,000 in May. On this trajectory, Tombs expects the unemployment rate to peak at 4.8% by December. This year, the Fed has been in wait-and-see mode when it comes to cutting rates, and some strategists believe it's prioritizing bringing inflation down before turning to expansionary monetary policy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple is opening up about why your iPhone doesn't have a more personalized AI-powered Siri yet. It's a relatively rare example of the company speaking at greater length about a bruising setback months after it first issued a statement saying its development was taking "longer than we thought" and the AI feature would be delayed. The saga began a year ago at Apple's WWDC 2024 conference, where it introduced with much fanfare an overhauled version of Siri with new AI features. and Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, Craig Federighi, is speaking somewhat candidly in various interviews at this year's WWDC event about what went wrong. The short answer: Apple wants to get it right. "When you have an experience like asking Siri to do something, either it becomes something you can depend on reliably or it's something, in the end, you're just not going to use," Federighi told YouTuber iJustine. However, work continues on building a more capable Siri that can remember the name of a guy you had lunch with months prior, the kind of situation shown off in a now-deleted ad from last year with "The Last of Us" actor Bella Ramsey. That version of Siri — Federighi called it V1 — was intended to arrive in December 2024 or spring 2025, he told TechRadar. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider. Contact the reporter from a non-work device and email at jhart@businessinsider.com</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disney and Universal joined forces in a lawsuit against artificial intelligence image creator Midjourney, alleging copyright infringement. It is the first AI copyright lawsuit from Hollywood giants. Disney and Universal are demanding a jury trial, arguing that the actions threaten to "upend the bedrock incentives of U.S. copyright law." Both companies said they sent letters to Midjourney's counsel to prevent further copyright infringement, but the company continued to release new iterations of its image generator. "​​Midjourney, which has attracted millions of subscribers and made $300 million last year alone, is focused on its own bottom line and ignored Plaintiffs' demands," the suit says. CNBC has reached out to Midjourney for comment on the case. This is one of the most significant copyright legal battles to date involving AI. "Creativity is the cornerstone of our business," said Kimberley Harris, executive vice president and general counsel of NBCUniversal, in a statement. "We are bringing this action today to protect the hard work of all the artists whose work entertains and inspires us and the significant investment we make in our content." Midjourney told Disney it was reviewing the letter but never responded, according to the suit. Universal said Midjourney did not respond to its letter. "We are bullish on the promise of AI technology and optimistic about how it can be used responsibly as a tool to further human creativity," said Horacio Gutierrez, senior executive vice president and chief legal and compliance officer of The Walt Disney Company, in a statement. "But piracy is piracy, and the fact that it's done by an AI company does not make it any less infringing."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The entire Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board resigned over what it said Wednesday was meddling by the Trump administration in the board's authority to award scholarships. The 12-member board, in a statement, said the State Department, which runs the scholarship program, had denied Fulbright awards "to a substantial number of individuals who were selected for the 2025-2026 academic year." "The administration is also currently subjecting an additional 1,200 foreign Fulbright recipients to an unauthorized review process and could reject more," the board said in its statement, which was posted on Substack. Like every other member of the board, Katz was appointed to the panel by former President Joe Biden. The other board members who resign include people who served in Biden's administration, among them Mala Adiga, who was a deputy assistant to Biden, former White House deputy chief of staff Jen O'Malley Dillon, who chaired Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign, and former Biden speechwriter Vinay Reddy. CNBC has requested comment from the State Department. "Effective immediately, members of the Congressionally mandated Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board voted overwhelmingly to resign from the board, rather than endorse unprecedented actions that we believe are impermissible under the law, compromise U.S. national interests and integrity, and undermine the mission and mandates Congress established for the Fulbright program nearly 80 years ago," the board said in its statement. "At the program's inception, Congress clearly specified that the Fulbright Board has final approval authority of applicants, which occurs after an exhaustive and deliberate, year-long process led by non-partisan career staff at the State Department and Embassies around the world," the board said.

Asked on CNBC's "Money Movers" if the current U.S. tariffs on China are not going to change again, Lutnick replied, "You can definitely say that." President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post Wednesday morning that U.S. duties on China will total 55% — but a White House official told CNBC soon after that that figure is not new. Trump sent his all-caps post hours after Lutnick and other trade negotiators for the two economic superpowers concluded high-level talks in London. The president said the deal is "done," but added that it is still "subject to final approval" between himself and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump said China's tariffs on the U.S. will stay at 10%, where they have stood since both sides agreed last month to temporarily pare back retaliatory duties on each others' goods. That 90-day reprieve came after initial talks in Geneva, Switzerland, that yielded a tentative de-escalation on tariffs but left other key sticking points unclear. Trump in Wednesday's post also wrote that "full magnets, and any necessary rare earths, will be supplied, up front, by China" as a result of the London talks. Beijing was "slow-rolling" its export of rare earths, prompting retaliation from Washington — including a crackdown on visas for Chinese students at U.S. universities, Lutnick said. "We were at mutual assured annoyance," the secretary said. But Trump's one-on-one phone call with Xi last week "changed everything," Lutnick said. "They are going to approve all applications for magnets from United States companies right away," he said. But Lutnick's optimism papered over unanswered questions that importers have about China's promises. This would allow Beijing to revisit its decision to issue any given license every six months, creating uncertainty in the supply chain for U.S. companies. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Lutnick's remarks, or for additional details on the London agreement terms.

FEMA recently told Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri and Oklahoma it won't be granting funds to bolster state defenses against future natural disasters.

The Trump administration is increasingly skipping a form of federal disaster aid that helps states better prepare for future storms, flooding and wildfires. 

The Federal Emergency Management Agency rejected requests for such resiliency money, known as Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funding, for Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri and Oklahoma last week, part of a trend that started this spring.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Surviving the gruelling hours and high demands of a job in consulting isn't easy. Deloitte has a new solution to help its employees handle the stress: Lego. The Big Four professional services firm has updated its long-running well-being subsidy program to include "Legos and puzzles" on a list of items that Deloitte will reimburse, internal policy documents seen by Business Insider show. The firm has long offered eligible US staff an annual subsidy to spend on one or a combination of subscriptions, equipment, and experiences. Most partners and salaried workers are offered the benefit. Interns, contracted professionals, and employees on a leave of absence are not eligible. One Deloitte US employee told BI that people were discussing the new updates in internal team chats. or jokes about how they can now rationalize buying the coveted Millennium Falcon Star Wars Lego set," the employee said. Lego's most expensive set, the Star Wars Ultimate Collector Series Millennium Falcon, costs $850, leaving Deloitte workers with a small allowance left over to spend on other qualifying items like fencing classes or neck pillows. A second Deloitte employee told BI that they see the subsidy as a nod of appreciation from the company for dealing with the stress and frustrations of their job. They added that Lego was receiving a lot of attention in the office, as it was a departure from the basics. "Knocking out a four-hour Lego build in under two hours is a great stress reliever," the employee said. Employees can also spend the subsidy on items like office furniture, gym equipment, financial support apps, fitness classes, and gaming consoles, including the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation. Deloitte US did not respond to a request for comment from BI. Not all are as positive about the subsidy program, with one Deloitte US employee telling BI they think it is only given "because of how much this job sucks." The US division of Deloitte has faced a challenging period after its contracts with the government came under scrutiny as part of the White House Office's efforts to cut federal spending. By April, at least 127 of the firm's government contracts had been cut or modified, according to BI's analysis of data on the DOGE website. That month, Deloitte Consulting CEO Jason Salzetti said in an internal meeting that a "small percentage" of workers in the firm's government division would be laid off. Employees told BI that DOGE's actions had shifted the climate at Deloitte. The US branch of Deloitte had 172,800 employees in 2024, when it last reported head count.</p>
