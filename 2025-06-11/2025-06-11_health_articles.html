                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Herpes zoster (HZ) is common in older people, with a lifetime risk of 25%. The main risk factors are advanced age and immunosuppression. People with a rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease have an overall higher risk for shingles. EULAR - The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology - recommends that HZ vaccination be considered in high-risk patients with an autoimmune and inflammatory RMD. The abstract describes the tolerability and safety of RZV in patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (iRMD), showcasing interim data from an ongoing study. In total, 150 adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), or giant cell arteritis (GCA) who had an indication to receive RZV were prospectively included. Of these, 21.3% had a history of HZ, and everyone received RZV at Month 0; 90% also received a dose at Month 2. Most adverse events (AE) occurred within a few days after vaccination. In total, 139 (46.8%) localized and 158 (53.2%) generalized AE occurred up to Month 3. This was followed by fever (14.1%), fatigue (9.4%), musculoskeletal pain (8.1%), swelling at the injection site (6.4%) and redness at the injection site (6.4%). Infections (4.7%), worsening of the disease (3.7%) and other AEs (7.7%) were reported until Month 3. Disease flares were reported by patients at Months 2, 3, 6 and 12, but of these only 1.6-8.6% fulfilled the predefined flare criteria. Lead author Uta Kiltz said "over the observed period of 12 months, this can be interpreted as a low rate of events." Overall, 10 serious AEs were reported in 9 patients during follow-up (3 flares, 4 malignancies, and 3 comorbidities), but no patient reported an AE of special interest or a breakthrough infection. The authors concluded that the majority of patients tolerated RZV well, with only a few reports of flare and serious AEs. These findings are reassuring for rheumatologists and future vaccine recipients, and support confidence in RZV safety for patients with an iRMD. Kiltz U, et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A newly identified network of nerve cells is responsible, a research group at the Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research has discovered in mice. They discovered a direct connection from the nose to a group of nerve cells in the brain that are activated by the smell of food and, when activated, trigger a feeling of fullness. This was not the case in obese mice. This discovery suggests that treating obesity might require different advice about smelling food before a meal based on a person's weight. These nerve cells respond to food in two steps: When the mouse smells food, the nerve cells fire and create a sensation of fullness. This happens within a few seconds because the nerve cells are directly connected to the olfactory bulb. Overall, the mice ate less when these nerve cells are active before eating. We think this mechanism helps mice in the wild protect themselves from predators. By eating for shorter periods, they reduce their chances of being caught." In obese mice, the same group of nerve cells was not activated when the mice could smell food. The newly identified group of nerve cells could also be affected by obesity. Studies by other research groups have shown that smelling some specific odors before a meal can reduce people's appetite. "Our findings highlight how crucial it is to consider the sense of smell in appetite regulation and in the development of obesity. Since we discovered that the pathway only reduces appetite in lean mice, but not in obese mice, our study opens up a new way to help prevent overeating in obesity", says Sophie Steculorum, the head of the study and research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have discovered that certain immune cells — called neutrophils — can start making a protein called DUOX2 that they usually do not produce. This surprise activity may be fuelling gut inflammation in conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The international study led by Professor Ulla Knaus, UCD School of Medicine and UCD Conway Institute shows this unusual protein production might damage the intestine and make these diseases worse. These surprise findings may lead to a new target for treating inflammatory bowel disease in the future. They usually help fight infections by attacking bacteria and cleaning up damaged tissues. DUOX2 is a protein that creates chemicals to repel germs but can also damage the body if there is too much of it. Normally, neutrophils do not contain DUOX2 but in people with gut disease, some neutrophils start making this protein (called 'de novo' expression). Our findings show that the new DUOX2 protein can lead to too many reactive chemicals being produced, which causes inflammation in the gut. If we can stop neutrophils from making DUOX2 or discover inhibitors, it might help clinicians to treat gut inflammation in the future." Prof. Knaus said, "Interestingly, we have seen early indications in our research that neutrophil DUOX may also be a promising therapeutic target in acute inflammation across other organs as well. This presents a breakthrough for drug discovery in neutrophil-driven inflammatory diseases." This international collaboration included University of California; the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, U.S.A. as well as academic and clinical colleagues across Ireland.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study from Karolinska Institutet involving over a million women links difficult childhood experiences to the risk of being diagnosed with endometriosis later in life. The study shows a link between childhood exposure to violence and a twofold increase in the risk of developing this gynecological disease. These cells attach to the abdominal lining, uterus, ovaries or other organs and form endometriosis lesions. The lesions react to sex hormones and bleed during menstruation, leading to pain and inflammation that can cause adhesions between organs, which increases the pain. Although endometriosis, which affects one in ten women, is a relatively common disease, its causes are still not fully understood. A new study published in the journal Human Reproduction has now identified a link between different types of difficult childhood experiences and an increased risk of developing endometriosis. The study included more than 1.3 million women born in Sweden between 1974 and 2001. Factors such as having parents with mental illness, substance abuse, financial problems or intellectual disabilities, having a teenage parent, death in the family, and being exposed to or subjected to violence and sexual abuse were examined. Experiencing any of these risk factors was linked to a 20 per cent increased risk of endometriosis diagnosis compared to women who had not been exposed. Among those who had five or more factors, the risk increased to 60 per cent." Marika Rostvall, study's first author, physician and doctoral student at the Department of Global Public Health, Karolinska Institutet The strongest link was observed in children who had been exposed to violence. These children had more than twice the risk of developing endometriosis later in life compared to women who had not been exposed. The findings are also in line with previous research showing that difficulties in childhood have profound consequences for future health," says Marika Rostvall. Research has not yet established the link between difficult childhood experiences and endometriosis, but Marika Rostvall highlights two possible explanations. "One explanation is that stress during childhood can affect the immune system, which could prevent it from effectively eliminating endometriosis tissue. Another explanation is that trauma during childhood could affect the body's sensitivity to pain, which can lead to increased pain and thus a higher likelihood of being diagnosed with endometriosis," says Marika Rostvall, continuing: "I hope that the findings can be used to improve both preventive measures and treatment in healthcare.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Millions of people might drop or lose coverage by 2034 as a result, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. States that run their own Obamacare marketplaces and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners have also raised concerns about added costs and reduced access. But House Republicans and some conservative think tanks say the ACA needs revamping to rein in fraud, part of which they pin on certain Biden administration changes the measures would undo. Here are four key ways Trump's policies could undermine Obamacare enrollment and coverage. The House-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which runs more than 1,000 pages, would create paperwork requirements that could delay access to tax credits for some enrollees, potentially raising the cost of their insurance. More than 90% of ACA enrollees receive tax credits to defray monthly premiums for their coverage. There are two key provisions for them to watch. One would end automatic reenrollment for most ACA policyholders each year. More than 10 million people were automatically reenrolled in their coverage for the 2025 plan year, with their eligibility for tax credits confirmed via a system that allows ACA marketplaces to check government or other data sources. The House bill would instead require every new or returning policyholder each year to provide information on income, household size, immigration status, and other factors, starting in 2028. If they don't, they won't get a premium tax credit, which could put the price of coverage out of reach. She and other policy experts fear that many consumers will become uninsured because they don't understand the requirements or find them burdensome. But supporters of the House bill say the current approach needs changing because it is vulnerable to waste, fraud, and abuse. Today, people who experience life changes — losing a job, getting married or divorced, or having a baby, for instance — are considered provisionally eligible for tax credits to reduce their premiums if they sign up or change their ACA plans. That means they would be eligible to receive these subsidies for at least 90 days while their applications are checked against government data or other sources, or marketplaces follow up with requests for additional information. The House bill would end that, requiring documentation before receiving tax credits. That could create particular hardship for new parents, who can't confirm that babies are eligible for premium subsidies until they receive Social Security numbers weeks after they're born. It can take up to six weeks for the Social Security Administration to process a number for a newborn, and an additional two weeks for parents to get the card, according to a white paper that analyzed provisions of the House bill and was co-authored by Jason Levitis, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, and Christen Linke Young, a visiting fellow with Brookings' Center on Health Policy. Without a Social Security number, any application to add a newborn to an ACA policy would automatically generate a hold on premium tax credits for that family, they wrote — increasing their out-of-pocket costs, at least temporarily. Provisions in the House bill that would require ACA enrollees to provide information each year that they reenroll — or when seeking to add or change a policy due to a life circumstance — would increase the number of people without health insurance by 700,000 in 2034, according to the latest CBO estimate. But the window would be shortened by about a month, with an end date of Dec. 15. This affects people in states that use the federal marketplace as well as the 19 states and the District of Columbia that run their own, most of which offer open enrollment into at least mid-January. Also, as soon as the end of this year, a special enrollment period the Biden administration created would be done away with. It allowed people with lower incomes — those who earn up to 1.5 times the 2024 federal poverty level, or about $38,730 for a family of three — to sign up anytime during the year. Critics, including the Paragon Institute, argue that this enrollment opening led to fraud, partly blaming it for a steep increase last year in instances of insurance agents seeking commissions by enrolling or switching consumers into plans without their consent, or fudging their incomes to qualify them for tax credits so large they paid no monthly premiums at all. But supporters — including some states that run their own ACA exchange — say there are other ways to address fraud. "We anticipate that much of the improper activity can be prevented by security and integrity upgrades to the federal marketplace, which we understand the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is implementing," the National Association of Insurance Commissioners wrote in a May 29 letter to congressional leaders. Those more generous payments are credited with helping double ACA enrollment since 2020. The House bill instead funds an extension of Trump's tax cuts, which largely benefit wealthier families. If the enhanced credits are allowed to expire, not only would premium subsidies be smaller for many people, but there would also be an abrupt eligibility cutoff — an income cliff — for households above four times the federal poverty rate, or about $103,280 for a family of three for this plan year. The CBO expects that about 4.2 million more people will be uninsured in 2034 as a result.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Y chromosome-located mammalian sex-determining gene Sry, required for the formation of testis, is activated only within a narrow time window during embryogenesis. The Sry gene directs sexually undifferentiated gonads to differentiate into testes rather than ovaries. The Sry gene is initially inactive because of a modification added to DNA-wrapping proteins called histone methylation. In males, a protein called KDM3A is responsible for removing this histone methylation, allowing the Sry gene to become active. We already knew that KDM3A requires iron for its enzymatic activity. Therefore, we wanted to investigate the extent and nature of iron metabolism and histone demethylation in sex determination." The researchers established mice lacking Tfrc, a gene crucial for cellular iron incorporation. When inspecting the genitals of these mice, it was found that some XY mice developed as female, despite being genetically male. The team also established an organ culture system for gonadal cells in which they could manipulate the levels of available iron. Therefore, the reduced Sry suppression under iron-deficient conditions was caused by the failure of KDM3A to remove histone methylation. Perhaps most significantly, they then showed that maternal iron deficiency - whether induced by diet or by pharmacological intervention - could lead to altered histone methylation of the Sry gene because of reduced KDM3A activity. Some population of XY offspring derived from iron-deficient pregnant females were shown to undergo male-to-female sex reversal, potentially due to the impaired Sry activation. "Our findings indicate that iron deficiency leads to disorders of male development, at least in mice. Our study emphasizes the importance of maintaining maternal iron levels," explains senior author, Makoto Tachibana. Understanding how iron supports embryonic development underscores the importance of maternal iron intake for the healthy development of human embryos. Maternal iron deficiency causes male-to-female sex reversal in mouse embryos. Discover how microscopy revealed the influence norepinephrine has on anxiety.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) Embryo Models Working Group has released updated recommendations for the oversight and regulation of stem cell-based embryo models (SCBEM), aiming to address rapid advancements and ensure responsible scientific progress. SCBEMs are three dimensional structures that replicate key aspects of early embryonic development, offering unprecedented potential to enhance our understanding of human developmental biology and reproductive science. Stem cell-based embryo models are poised to revolutionize our understanding of early human development and improve clinical practices in assisted reproduction. However, as these models advance, it is crucial that they are studied in a framework that balances scientific progress with ethical, legal, and social considerations. These proposed recommendations are designed to foster innovation while at the same time providing regulatory guidance for key stakeholders in this vital area of biomedical research." Amander Clark, University of California, Los Angeles, USA, co-chair of the ISSCR Embryo Models Working Group and an expert in human stem cell and reproductive science Janet Rossant, CC, PhD, world-renowned expert in developmental biology and co-chair of the ISSCR Embryo Models Working Group stated, "Given the acceleration of these technologies, it was important to convene a working group to evaluate whether the existing ISSCR Guidelines should be amended to keep pace with new advances." The recommendations outlined in the paper, Stem cell-based embryo models: the 2021 ISSCR stem cell guidelines revisited, address recent scientific breakthroughs that enable the creation of increasingly complex models efficiently and without reliance on major extraembryonic lineages.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a revealing Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, Sara Poletti, PhD, senior researcher at IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele Milan, illuminates the profound connections between childhood adversity and lifelong vulnerability to psychiatric disorders through persistent neuroinflammation pathways and alterations in brain structure. Dr. Poletti's groundbreaking research has transformed understanding of how early life experiences become biologically embedded, creating lasting changes in brain structure and immune function. As the only tenure-track psychologist in psychiatry at her institute, she has pioneered multidisciplinary approaches that combine neuroimaging, genetic analysis, and immunological markers to decode the biological signatures of childhood trauma. The immune system doesn't just fight infections-it plays a crucial role in shaping our mental health throughout life. Childhood trauma can fundamentally reprogram these immune responses, creating vulnerability to depression, bipolar disorder, and other psychiatric conditions decades later." Sara Poletti, PhD, senior researcher at IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele Milan Her work raises critical questions about prevention and intervention: Can we identify biological markers of trauma early enough to prevent psychiatric disorders? Dr. Poletti's path to neuroscience began with a childhood microscope and evolved through encounters with Freud's writings and neuroimaging studies of violent criminals. This eclectic background equipped her with unique perspectives on brain-behavior relationships. Despite warnings that psychedelic and inflammation research was "career suicide" in 2006, she persisted in exploring these then-marginalized areas that have since become central to psychiatric research. Her leadership of a European Research Area Network (ERA-NET) Neuron project on the consequences of infections on mental health exemplifies her ability to foster international collaboration in advancing inflammation's role in psychiatric disorders. One defining moment in Dr. Poletti's career came when she reluctantly accepted a teaching position in human physiology-a field she knew little about. "It required extensive studying and put me to the test," she recalls. "However, I learned a great deal from this experience, both scientifically and personally." Some individuals exposed to severe childhood adversity develop psychiatric disorders while others don't-understanding these differences could revolutionize preventive psychiatry. By identifying specific inflammatory markers associated with childhood trauma, her work provides potential targets for novel interventions. This precision medicine approach could transform psychiatric treatment from symptom management to addressing underlying biological mechanisms. Following this line of reasoning she published the first paper on the use of an immunomodulatory agent (interleukin 2) to treat mood disorders. Her vision includes developing prevention strategies to reduce mental illness odds, particularly for individuals with trauma histories. This preventive focus represents a paradigm shift from reactive to proactive psychiatric care. The interview reveals how Dr. Poletti's passion for Italian mountain hiking informs her scientific approach. Standing atop Sasso Nero at 2,847 meters, she finds the clarity and renewal that fuel her research endeavors. This connection to nature reflects her holistic view of mental health, recognizing that human wellbeing extends beyond biological mechanisms to encompass environmental and experiential factors. Questions about trauma's transgenerational effects add another dimension to Dr. Poletti's work. Can childhood trauma alter genetic expression in ways that affect offspring? How do social and cultural factors modulate biological responses to adversity? These considerations expand the scope of trauma research from individual to societal levels. This integrated perspective challenges traditional boundaries between psychiatry and other medical specialties, promoting more comprehensive approaches to patient care. How can healthcare systems better integrate trauma screening and early intervention? Dr. Poletti's work provides scientific grounding for these critical policy discussions. Dr. Sara Poletti's Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today's most influential scientific breakthroughs. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Could a simple fiber supplement curb hunger and keep insulin in check? New research finds that this mineral-rich blend helps people feel fuller without raising blood sugar levels. Study: Impact of a mineral enriched, fiber complex on glycaemic response and satiation in healthy adults: a double-blind, crossover intervention study. In a recent study published in the European Journal of Nutrition, researchers investigated the effects of a mineral-enriched fiber complex on satiation and glycemic response. Excessive fat accumulation is a significant risk factor for various metabolic disorders. Weight gain in early adulthood is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and CVD mortality, compared to that in later life. This suggests the need for early interventions to support weight management and alleviate risks. Efforts to maintain a healthy weight can be challenging. Recent anti-obesity strategies have been revolutionized by glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists. However, these interventions often have undesirable effects, such as diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. In the present study, researchers investigated the impact of chromium-enriched glucomannan-fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) complex, i.e., SlimBiome (SB), intake on satiety and glycemic response in healthy adults. This randomized, crossover intervention trial recruited healthy adults aged 18–65, with normal fasting glucose levels and body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 kg/m² and 24.9 kg/m². The first was a screening and familiarization visit. Blood pressure, body fat percentage, and anthropometric indices were measured at the first visit. Participants were required to fast for 12 hours before each visit and refrain from consuming large meals and alcohol the previous day. A modified oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at visits 2 and 3. Blood was collected to measure fasting glucose and insulin levels. Participants consumed a dextrose drink at visit 2 or an SB plus dextrose (SBD) drink at visit 3, following which blood samples were collected at several time points (up to 2.5 hours) after intake. In addition, participants completed a questionnaire on subjective measures of appetite at 0 (baseline), 75, and 150 minutes post-intake; responses were recorded on the visual analog scale (VAS). A rapid viscoanalyzer was used to assess the viscosity kinetics of SB, SBD, and dextrose under gastric pH conditions. Further, insulin sensitivity was calculated using the Matsuda and Cederholm indices. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed to examine differences in insulin and glucose levels between the interventions (SBD and dextrose). Blood glucose levels remained unchanged and were not significantly different between dextrose and SBD conditions at any time during OGTT. Importantly, early insulin response (within 30 minutes) showed no significant difference between interventions. Insulin values at baseline and 150 minutes were not different with either intervention. Baseline VAS scores did not differ significantly between the dextrose and SBD conditions. However, significant increases were observed over time in the amount of food desired and hunger between baseline and 150 minutes upon dextrose intake. On the other hand, SBD intake significantly increased fullness 75 minutes post-intake. Crucially, at 150 minutes post-intake (but not earlier), subjects reported being significantly less hungry and fuller with SBD than with dextrose across all appetite metrics (including desire to eat and amount of food desired). However, there were no differences between SB and SBD. The researchers noted that chromium levels (15 µg/dose) were likely too low to drive effects, suggesting benefits primarily stem from fibers' viscosity-related mechanisms. As an acute study, long-term effects remain unexplored. In summary, SBD significantly reduced insulin levels at 45, 75, and 90 minutes, as well as AUCins at 150 minutes post-intake, compared to dextrose, without affecting glucose levels. This underscores the potential beneficial impact of SB on postprandial insulin response. SBD intake resulted in later-occurring (150 min) lower sensations of hunger and increased fullness. These findings offer valuable insights and suggest the potential use of SB in weight management strategies, though longer-term studies are needed to confirm effects.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Human metabolism is a complex web of chemical processes and interactions between our cells and the microbes living within us. Metabolites are the language that the body uses to communicate with itself and with our microbiome, and studying them can offer significant insight into the role of microbial metabolism in health and disease. It's like we've added hundreds of new words to the metabolic dictionary." Pieter Dorrestein, Ph.D., senior author, professor at UC San Diego Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Departments of Pharmacology and Pediatrics at UC San Diego School of Medicine Human metabolism is a delicate system, and imbalances in metabolism have been linked to a wide range of diseases, including diabetes, cancer and neurological disorders. For decades, much of the underlying biochemistry of human metabolism, including the role of the human microbiome, has gone unknown, making it harder to understand and treat diseases related to metabolism. The hundreds of new compounds help fill this knowledge gap. "The big surprise here was how diverse this group of compounds actually is," said first author Helena Mannochio Russo, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in Dorrestein's lab. The distribution pattern of these molecules also varied based on diet, microbial colonization, and in people with diseases that impact the microbiome, such as diabetes. The researchers also found that these microbial metabolites were associated with HIV status and cognitive impairment, suggesting a potential link between the gut microbiome and neurological function in individuals with HIV. However, it will take more research to fully understand the implications of this connection of the gut microbes language and how they affect cognition. "There's so much we can learn from existing data, and the more we utilize reverse metabolomics, the more we'll be able to learn about how the microbiome interacts with us and impacts our health, and the faster we'll be able to learn from it," added Mannochio Russo. The microbiome diversifies long- to short-chain fatty acid-derived N-acyl lipids. Discover how microscopy revealed the influence norepinephrine has on anxiety.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study from Emory University addresses the growing global crisis of antibiotic-resistant infections. The study, published in PNAS, looks at a particular bacterium called Acinetobacter baumannii, which is highly infectious, spread mostly in hospitals and typically infects immunocompromised patients. The researchers employed an entirely new strategy to identify weaknesses specific to resistant bacteria and then target these weaknesses with an alternate drug. They found that fendiline, a drug that acts as a calcium channel blocker and formerly used to treat heart arrhythmia kills the bacterium by targeting the essential lipoprotein trafficking pathway, which is weakened in antibiotic resistant bacteria. It's critical that we find more and better therapeutics that can target these antibiotic-resistant infections which affect patients on ventilators, those with deep soft tissue infections, and the immunocompromised." Philip Rather, PhD, corresponding author on the paper and professor, Emory University School of Medicine "This novel finding repurposes an existing drug, exploits a newly identified vulnerability in an antibiotic-resistant bacterium, and opens doors for developing new antibiotics targeting similar pathways," says Jennifer Colquhoun, PhD, first author and research scientist at Emory University.
