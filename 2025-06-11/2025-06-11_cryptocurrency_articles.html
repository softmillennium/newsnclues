                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strategy—the freshly rebranded MicroStrategy (MSTR)—has shifted from being an enterprise software firm that sells business-intelligence (BI) tools to the world's largest corporate owner of bitcoin. It holds about 581,000 bitcoins, worth around $63 billion, which is significantly higher than its annual software revenue of about $463 million. (All data here and below are as of early June 2025.) Founder and CEO Michael Saylor calls the company a “Bitcoin Treasury Company,” a moniker the early 2025 name change makes explicit. To fund this hoard, Strategy has issued waves of zero-coupon convertible notes and new equity, turning itself into a leveraged bet on "digital gold." Michael Saylor co-founded MicroStrategy in 1989. Through the 1990s the firm landed data-mining deals with McDonald's and others, and went public in 1998, briefly making Saylor a paper billionaire during the dot-com boom. After nearly going bankrupt because of a 2000 accounting scandal that resulted in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission settlement, the company steadily pivoted toward cloud analytics. Fast-forward to August 2020, when Saylor first deployed some $250 million of idle cash into bitcoin, citing cash-debasement fears. Multiple follow-on buys—financed first with cash, then with debt—turned the firm into “Wall Street's bitcoin proxy.” The company's metamorphosis was completed with Strategy's name change, complete with an orange palette inspired by bitcoin. Saylor champions his “infinite money glitch,” arguing that borrowing cheaply against stock to buy scarcer bitcoin offers shareholders leveraged digital gold exposure. Other high-profile companies are looking to follow Strategy's Bitcoin treasury playbook, with both Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) and GameStop Corp. (GME) announcing massive fundraising in 2025 to do so. Strategy rarely pays cash for coins anymore. Instead, MSTR prefers to issue zero-coupon convertible notes with generous conversion premiums, effectively providing free money unless the stock tanks. It had already raised billions of dollars this way, part of a pattern that Bloomberg says has made convertible-arbitrage “Wall Street's hottest trade.” Issuing equity is another lever: during the first quarter of 2025 alone, Strategy sold $7.7 billion in new shares and then bought another 22,048 BTC at an average price of about $87,000. To back this financial engineering, Strategy's slide deck often highlights the following metrics: However, the math only works if Bitcoin continues to rise. A 30% slide in March briefly saddled the company with an unrealized $5.9 billion loss, rattling MSTR's share price. Analysts warn that prolonged crypto winters would squeeze cash flow and could force asset sales or refinancings that dilute shareholder value. Its zero-coupon structure, furthermore, can let bondholders demand cash back if volatility spikes, creating a reflexive risk loop for shareholders. Still, MSTR's recent inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 has meant that passive index funds tracking it have bought its shares, which will help cushion any potential drawdowns. Investors looking to Strategy as a BTC play might be getting played themselves: At a market cap of $105.28 billion and bitcoin holdings at about $62.6 billion, that's almost a 70% premium over its BTC holdings. Compare that to most closed-end funds (where a 10% premium is pricey) or the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (BTC), where our calculations show a 3.2% discount of its share price to net asset value per share. For every $1.00 you invest, MSTR provides $0.59 worth of BTC exposure, whereas for the BTC ETF, you get $1.03. Strategy continues to sell its Strategy One analytics suite—an AI-infused business intelligence and data platform, which has sustained growth in subscriptions. The company also runs Strategy World, an annual technology conference that, in 2025, spotlighted new generative AI features rolling into its platform. Strategy has morphed from a middling BI vendor into a leveraged macro bet on Bitcoin, wrapped around its still-functioning software business. If the crypto bull run persists, shareholders will reap the gains from embedded leverage in both equity and convertibles. "MicroStrategy Full Year 2024 Earnings: Misses Expectations."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the Senate, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 (GENIUS) Act is the much-revised bill that had already garnered bipartisan approvals in multiple procedural votes and is now on what's expected to be an inevitable path Wednesday. The Senate needed to clear the high bar of 60 votes to move to the final vote, which was easily obtained as many Democrats joined Republicans in pushing forward toward stablecoin regulation. The bill would establish a system under which stablecoins can be issued in the U.S. under the watch of state or federal regulators, and leaving some avenues for non-financial corporations to launch their own coins (a point of criticism from Democrats). Regulating these assets is fundamental to the operations of the crypto markets, in which dollar-based tokens such as Circle's USDC$0.99968 and Tether's USDT$1.00 are routinely used in transactions and contracts. In the previous congressional session, what was then the Democrat-run Senate Banking Committee stood in the way of advancing crypto legislation, but its current Republican chairman, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, has become a crypto advocate. The chamber's overall pro-crypto sentiment has been growing stronger in this session and will be further cemented by Wednesday's votes. Before Wednesday's voting, the GENIUS Act's sponsor, Senator Bill Hagerty, asked his colleagues for support on the bill. "If we fail to act now, not only will these benefits slip away, we'll also fall behind in global competitiveness without a regulatory framework.But Senator Elizabeth Warren, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, took to the Senate floor to blast the GENIUS Act. "The bill permits stablecoin issuers to invest in risky assets and allows them to engage in risky non-stablecoin activities like private credit or derivatives trading. "Warren had a sharp message for fellow members of her party, many of whom were set to support the bill, that they "should show a little spine" and insist that Republicans allow some of the amendments pushed earlier by Democrats. Crypto lobbyists in Washington argue alongside their lawmakers allies that both bills are needed to properly regulate the industry in the U.S. Jesse Hamilton is CoinDesk's deputy managing editor on the Global Policy and Regulation team, based in Washington, D.C.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin enters a unique market phase as rising long-term holder dominance and compressed volatility could potentially trigger a fresh round of price discovery. A unique divergence emerged as long-term Bitcoin holders took profits, while the overall supply held by this cohort continues to rise. Bitcoin's volatility has dropped to the 10th percentile, its lowest range in a decade, despite prices trading near all-time highs. Bitcoin (BTC) price is hovering just a few percentage points below its all-time high of $111,800, and data from onchain analytics provider Glassnode reveals a “unique dynamic of this cycle,” as long-term holders continue to dominate wealth distribution, even at the later stage of the bull market. The data highlights that long-term holders (LTHs) — those holding BTC for over 155 days — are realizing significant profits, with their net realized profit/loss peaking at $930 million per day. Despite this, the overall supply held by LTHs is still rising. The report termed this a “unique duality” in market structure, where selling pressure is outweighed by ongoing accumulation. This change in holders' behavior has been largely attributed to institutional investors and US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which favor long-term custody. Further evidence of this late-cycle behavior appears in the realized profit/loss ratio, currently at 9.4, indicating that most long-term coins spent have been at substantial profit. Historically, such levels coincide with market euphoria and often precede a local or cycle top, although they can persist for months if demand sustains. Related: Michael Saylor rejects crypto winter fears, says Bitcoin ‘going to $1M' On one hand, realized supply density, which measures how concentrated Bitcoin's ownership is near the current price, has climbed in recent weeks. In such tightly clustered environments, minor price swings can trigger outsized emotional or trading responses, raising the risk of sudden volatility. At-the-money implied volatility (ATM IV) — a gauge of expected future price swings derived from Bitcoin options pricing — continues to fall across all timeframes. This suggests that traders aren't bracing for significant price dislocations soon. Likewise, data from Ecoinometrics shows Bitcoin's weekly volatility has now dropped to the 10th percentile, lower than 90% of weeks in the last 10 years, despite Bitcoin setting a new all-time high and rallying strongly in May. It could signal that Bitcoin may be entering a new regime, reflecting strong performance without erratic price swings, which is an attractive setup for institutional investors focused on risk-adjusted returns. With BTC price perched at the top of a dense supply cluster and institutional inflows anchoring demand, the market appears stable, but tightly wound. If new demand outpaces profit-taking, Bitcoin could burst through its volatility ceiling. But if sentiment cracks, the pullback may be sharper than expected.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A $1 million mansion in Kentucky owned by the crypto bros jailed for allegedly torturing a man for his digital coins was raided by authorities Tuesday. The six-bedroom waterfront home in Smithland — which appears to be styled after the White House — was bought by self-styled “Crypto King of Kentucky” John Woeltz and his business partner William Duplessie for $1 million cash in January, multiple sources told The Post. Video of the raid obtained by The Post shows armored vehicles being brought by truck into the town, which has a population of less than 300, and a series of unmarked black SUVs and trucks at the property. Authorities have yet to say if anything was recovered from the property. Woeltz, 33, and Duplessie, 37, are in jail over charges they allegedly held an associate, Michael Carturan, captive in another house they were renting in New York. They are alleged to have tortured him with a chainsaw while attempting to get him to hand over the password for his digital wallet containing $28 million in cryptocurrency over 17 days in May, according to prosecutors. “There was talk they were looking at making the mansion a venue for events. “But there were all kinds of rumors going around. At the same time there was an undercurrent that something wasn't right,” said Joshua Johnson, who lived opposite the mansion until recently. New evidence against the pair was presented at a hearing Wednesday, where prosecutors accused them of holding another two people against their will and unveiled new evidence, including a photo of them setting Carturan, an Italian national, on fire. Property deeds for the house obtained by The Post show it was bought by a Wyoming LLC, which was incorporated just weeks before the January 27 sale. A source close to the sale told The Post: “Their cash was good and that's all I know.” Carturan had raised the alarm against them after escaping from the house on Prince Street where he claimed he had been held and flagging down a traffic officer on May 23. During their time in New York, Woeltz and Duplessie, who hails from Connecticut, gained a reputation for their hard partying and lavish spending.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Not satisfied with staying confined to their own Pudgy World metaverse, Pudgy Penguins are expanding into a new virtual world, according to a press release shared with The Defiant. A core part of the partnership is a special zone in the game built for Pudgy Penguin NFT collection holders. My Neighbor Alice will feature a special Pudgy Land region in its new Snowflake Wilds, “a frosty, feel-good winter wonderland” area of the game. Holders of Pudgy Penguins and Lil Pudgys will enter the game with their NFT as an egg that hatches to become their specific NFT. Holders of Pudgy Rods, which are fishing rods created to accompany each Pudgy Penguin NFT, will be able to equip them with custom fishing rod skins and use them to catch special fish. “With this partnership we're pushing the envelope when it comes to interoperability,” said Steve Haßenpflug, vice president of games at ChromaWay and My Neighbor Alice in a statement, continuing: My Neighbor Alice is built on the Chromia blockchain, where players can own, trade and sell virtual asset NFTs. The Pudgy Penguin brand's own Pudgy World metaverse, built on ZKSync, is currently in closed beta but promises to launch “soon.” Last month, Pudgy Penguins waddled over to the TON blockchain, allowing 1 billion-plus Telegram users to play Pengu Clash, a multiplayer skill game with mini-games like darts, football and bomber with token-based incentives, tournament rules, unlockable gear, accessories and team cosmetics, according to Pudgy Penguins. It is “pay-to-win” free, the company said in a release. Also in May, Pudgy Penguins revealed that it was expanding its off-chain activities beyond physical plushies to publishing a children's book with Random House titled “The Worst Birthday Present Ever.” NFT prices have dropped dramatically since the airdrop high, which lasted through January, but could be going up if the Securities and Exchange Commission green-lights Canary Capital's proposed Pudgy Penguin ETF, which will hold PENGU tokens as well as up to 15% of its assets in Pudgy Penguin NFTs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Its seven-day gains have outpaced major altcoins as Bitcoin volatility posts record lows for the year, pushing a relatively stable trading pattern. HYPE traded at $41.31, down 0.3% on the day, yet maintaining strong momentum with 12.4% weekly gains and 67.2% monthly appreciation, according to data from CoinGecko. It has sustained this uptrend since mid-May, with recent price action pushing HYPE back toward monthly highs around the $42 range. For instance, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin posted modest gains, extending their upward momentum as the broader crypto market remains relatively stable. All three are showing signs of recovery from late-May lows, but remain well below recent local highs. Bitcoin, meanwhile, posted record lows for implied volatility, which gauges how much of its spot price could move further, based on options prices. But while the upswing "has legs short‑term, driven by liquidity, retail energy, and fresh institutional interest," Liu acknowledged how broader macro factors are still at play, citing how "tariff headlines and dollar strength" ratios add friction to the fray. The same factors could be drawn on Bitcoin, whose new highs have been “fueled by increasingly hard-to-ignore institutional participation,” and as such has “reignited optimism across the entire crypto space,” encouraging “renewed retail interest and appetite for altcoins perceived as strong projects or community favorites,” Jeth Ang, chief operating officer at modular onchain platform Sovrun, told Decrypt. "This institutional momentum creates a positive feedback loop, encouraging renewed retail interest and appetite for altcoins perceived as strong projects or community favorites," he added, saying that one of the things helping HYPE is its simple yet effective token design. Interest in Hyperliquid has resulted in "consistently high organic usage" as it competes with "centralized derivative exchanges like Binance and Bybit," analysts at investment firm Grayscale wrote last week, citing how the decentralized exchange has attracted users for its perpetual futures offerings, as fiscal risks generated broader demand for Bitcoin and other cryptos. In crypto, perpetual futures are derivatives contracts that never expire, allowing traders to speculate on price movements indefinitely without taking delivery of the underlying asset. The idea was first proposed in 1992 by American economist and Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller. It later gained traction and now accounts for roughly 93% of all derivatives trading in crypto, according to industry estimates. Last month, Hyperliquid joined a group of other top exchanges responding to the SEC's call on perpetuals, citing how "continuous, on-chain markets" such as its platform "already meet—and in several respects exceed" what the regulator requires "for resilience and customer protection."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>87 new projects coming as Ripple and Peersyst Technology lower entry barriers for developers using Ethereum tools. After years of testing, the XRP Ledger will finally launch its Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible sidechain in the second quarter of 2025. The development aims to expand XRP's utility beyond its traditional payment role by addressing alleged limitations in DeFi's programmability. Developed in a joint effort by Ripple and Peersyst Technology, the sidechain provides full EVM compatibility, allowing developers to deploy applications using established Ethereum tools like Solidity, MetaMask, and Truffle. The sidechain operates on a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, selected for performance and efficiency. Its targeted metrics are over 1,000 transactions per second and transaction costs below $0.01. To ensure network integrity, the sidechain's code underwent a security audit by Informal Systems in February 2025. The audit identified and led to the resolution of one critical issue related to a Cosmos SDK module, with other findings being of low risk. This initiative represents a strategic effort to attract developers from the larger EVM ecosystem and provide new avenues for applications on the XRP Ledger. By lowering the barrier to entry, the sidechain may foster a more diverse application environment for XRPL's user base, which holds over six million wallets. Activity on the sidechain's testnet suggests initial developer interest. According to a post from Peersyst, projects including Strobe Finance, Vertex Protocol, and Secured Labs are already building applications. The project's structure as a sidechain allows these new capabilities to be introduced without altering the XRPL mainnet's core protocol, which remains optimized for payments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TOKYO (Reuters) -Bank of Japan officials are ramping up calls to keep pace with rapid developments around digital currencies that may accelerate a shift to cashless payments in a country better known for its belief that "cash is king." Once seen as a society favouring physical currency, Japan saw the ratio of cashless payments rise to 42.8% in 2024, up from 13.2% in 2010 and hitting the government's 40% goal a year earlier than targeted, government data showed. This includes the option of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). While no decision has been made on whether to issue a digital yen, the BOJ began a pilot programme for developing a CBDC in 2023, and has been consulting with private firms and the government on its framework and design. "Although banknote issuance remains high in Japan, usage of notes could fall significantly in the future amid rapid digitalisation," BOJ Executive Director Kazushige Kamiyama told a meeting last week with private firms on the pilot programme. "As such, Japan must consider what steps it can take now to ensure its retail settlement system is convenient, efficient, accessible universally, while being safe and resilient." BOJ Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida said a CBDC may become "a critical piece of infrastructure" shaping the future of Japan's payment and settlement systems, but stressed that he did not expect demand for cash to disappear in Japan any time soon. "Looking to the future, in a society that has made significant advances in digitalization, there is no guarantee that currency issued by the central bank of a sovereign nation will continue to function as a generally acceptable payment instrument," he said. CBDCs are back in the spotlight after U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in January banning the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar, seemingly as part of a drive to promote cryptocurrencies and stablecoins instead. China is racing ahead with global ambitions to internationalise the yuan with transactions of the digital yuan more than tripling between June 2023 and June 2024.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brian Quintenz, President Donald Trump's pick for Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), stated during a nomination hearing on Tuesday that he would focus on a tech-first approach toward crypto regulations under his administration. During a nomination hearing with members of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, President Trump's CFTC nominee, Brian Quintenz, stated that the CFTC would adopt a tech-forward approach toward cryptocurrency regulations if Congress grants it oversight authority. Senator Ben Luján inquired about his plans to address anti-money laundering (AML) breaches related to cryptocurrency, citing that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has recently stepped back from enforcement. Quintenz said that crypto providers would likely be subject to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) laws, which currently regulate other financial entities. When asked about a crypto market structure bill, Quintenz shared that he views the legislation as a way to combine customer protection with innovation. "I have always viewed market structure legislation as an opportunity to be both pro-customer protection and pro-innovation at the same time," Quintenz stated. Quintenz further answered questions on prediction markets, drawing from his experience as a board member at Kalshi. "I believe the Commodity Exchange Act is very clear about the purpose of derivatives markets, the purpose of risk management and price discovery, and that events can serve a function in that mandate," he said. Before accepting the presidential nomination to be CFTC Chairman, Quintenz worked as a16z Crypto's Global Head of Policy, where he collaborated with several cryptocurrency startups. Quintenz also previously worked as a CFTC Commissioner from 2017 to 2021 and has been an advocate of innovation. If approved by the Committee, he will proceed to a full Senate vote before being inaugurated as the new CFTC Chairman by President Trump.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“As long as Gold stays sub-$3,365, we're likely going to see a sharp fall in the coming one to two weeks of anything between 4-10%, resulting into a sudden macroeconomic shift.” This is vital, as that would attract more investors towards Altcoins. But the trader warns that altcoins will likely see lower levels if gold shatters $3,365. “If it does break above that crucial level, the theory is invalidated, and we're likely open for printing new highs, which then means that we're printing new lows on altcoins. For me, this is crucial, as a correction in Gold and rally in the CNH (offshore Chinese renminbi) implies that we're going to be seeing more interest flowing into crypto after that.” At time of writing, gold is trading for $3,324, up more than 60% in the last 18 months.
