                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a historic drought that paralyzed vessel transits through the Panama Canal, the Panama Canal Authority is moving ahead with major investments in new infrastructure to mitigate future droughts and the risk of low water levels that in recent years plagued the key global trade gateway. The Panama Canal depends on fresh water for its operations and is rainfall dependent. "We use about two and a half times the amount of water a city of the size of New York uses for the canal operation," Ricaurte Vásquez, Administrator of the Panama Canal Authority, told CNBC. In a good year of rain, that means over 50 vessel transits through the canal's locks a day, but in recent years, weather has not cooperated. Severe drought conditions hit the region from late 2022 to 2024, forcing the canal to reduce transits and put in place vessel weight restrictions in an effort to conserve water. The U.S. is the largest user of the Panama Canal, with total U.S. commodity export and import containers representing about 73% of Panama Canal traffic, and 40% of all U.S. container traffic traveling through the Panama Canal every year. In April, Canal administration began the pre-qualification and selection process for concessionaires to build a land bridge, including what it describes as a flagship natural gas pipeline line to move natural gas liquids (NGLs) without relying on the canal itself. A road connecting both Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as port terminals built on either coast, would also be constructed, with the terminals also able to accommodate containers and roll-on and roll-off cargo. The Panama Canal Authority reported a 29% drop in vessel transits during fiscal year 2024, with the biggest hits in LNG and dry bulk transits. Even though water levels are back to regular operating conditions, LNG traffic has not returned to pre-drought transit activity, with carriers continuing to choose the longer route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, according to S&P Global data. Vasquez tells CNBC that U.S. energy companies are "drooling at the possibilities" of this alternative way to move the commodity. Transit time-wise, Vasquez said the pipeline would be competitive versus traversing the canal, and reliability would be higher because it is now water-dependent. "This is important because with many of these products, reliability and delivering on time are critical," he said. "We are aware that these are high-value products that have a destination in Asia," he said, noting the project was announced in Tokyo, which is the largest buyer of these energy products. The dam and tunnel project would add supplemental water for Lake Gatun, which feeds fresh water to the Panama Canal in order to operate. The older Panamax locks lose approximately 50-52 million gallons of fresh water per vessel transit. Construction for the dam is expected to begin in 2027 and would not be completed until 2032, with a cost estimated at $1.6 billion. Included in that cost is $400 million allocated for compensating and relocating about 2,500 residents from various communities whose villages would be flooded to create the dam. CNBC was the first television crew to go to one of the villages that would be impacted by the project, and villagers who spoke with CNBC said they did not want to leave. Neither project will be finished by the time the next El Niño weather phenomenon is expected, in 2027. Vasquez tells CNBC that some of the elements of the land bridge will be completed, but the pipeline is not expected to be completed until 2030-2031.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the search unfolded for conservative political activist Charlie Kirk's assassin, with the suspect identified on Friday as Tyler Robinson, law enforcement parsed every possible lead. One piece of evidence they homed in on: a forearm print taken from the sniper's position. Before Robinson's apprehension Friday morning as a result of very human methods — it has been reported that Robinson offered what may have been a form of confession to family members, who then shared the information, leading to his surrender — FBI agent Robert Bohls said investigators had collected a "footwear impression, a palm print and forearm imprints" from the crime scene for analysis. Forearm imprints are not a commonly collected piece of evidence, according to experts CNBC spoke with. "It's very unusual," said Patrick McClain, a Texas-based criminal defense attorney and retired Marine Corps military judge. McClain explained that typically, when a forearm print is mentioned, authorities have collected DNA or other skin residue from the surface against which the forearm was pressed. "It's merely a mold from an imprint left from remaining in a prone shooting position with forearms on the deck for a period of time," said Jeff Wenninger, founder and CEO of Law Enforcement Consultants, who has worked with the LAPD's elite Metropolitan Division and with the Secret Service in protecting dignitaries. Wenninger says that a forearm print can be used to corroborate identification purposes, such as unique characteristics like scarring or the imprint of known clothing worn. "Like fingerprints, a forearm print can be unique enough for identification if it's of sufficient quality," he said. It could also have a forensic value if biological material like sweat, body oils, or touch DNA can be recovered, and along with other evidence, it can corroborate or contradict witness statements or video footage. Physical impressions have been utilized in forensic investigations for years, Wenninger said, but in recent years, the methodologies for identifying and comparing specific meaningful markings have evolved, and the scanning technology for analyzing imprints has improved so much that "it seems new." 3D scanning has revolutionized this science, turning the forearm print into a reservoir of previously untapped information. An imprint alone cannot determine factors such as ethnicity and gender, and investigators would still be reliant on whether DNA or other biological evidence has been obtained from the imprint. "It's a newer exploration in forensics, including other skin prints. But it's not like a finger/palm print that is 100% unique," said Toby Braun, CEO and Founder of American Special Investigative Group, which specializes in executive protection, threat-intelligence monitoring, and complex investigations. The difficulty with forearm residue is that even in the most high-profile cases, any DNA would take a while to get results from, and that if the person is not in a known database, it won't be beneficial until there is an arrest. According to McClain, there have been cases tried with forearm prints if there is something unique, such as a tattoo or scarring pattern, "but I have never done one of those cases; they are definitely unusual," he said. "Additional evidence for the strongest possible case will be developed subsequently as the investigation is still ongoing," Braun said, adding that authorities just need probable cause for an arrest, and evidence beyond a reasonable doubt is for a trial. "But that is developed as the case progresses," he added. Dan Gerl, founder and managing attorney at Next Law, says that for a forearm's "pattern" to be lifted or photographed as evidence, the subject would have had to apply sufficient pressure upon a receptive surface area and that the prints are most useful as supporting evidence rather than primary, such as to support a request for a search warrant seeking additional evidence. "Under certain circumstances, forearm prints can also be admissible in court. Like all scientific evidence, forearm prints would have to be admitted by a qualified expert's testimony, and pass the court's tests for reliability," Gerl said. This type of forensic evidence would likely encounter more procedural hurdles to clear before being admitted at trial, he added. In the end, the arrest of Tyler Robinson came down to human rather than forensic connections, and some criminal experts say a defining feature of recent political violence is a killer's underlying desire to be caught rather than meticulously plan and evade capture. Bryanna Fox, a former FBI special agent and professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, says advances in crime technology have been notable over the past two decade, and some criminals may not be aware of the level of forensics available to law enforcement. "He may have thought, 'Oh, I can leave my forearm prints and it won't amount to anything," Fox said. But she thinks that another mindset may have been at work. Comparing the Robinson case to the case of Luigi Mangione, who assassinated a United Healthcare executive last year, Fox thinks ideologically driven criminals may care more about sending a message than about escaping consequences for their crimes. That means they may not be thinking about the trail of evidence they leave behind as much as some other criminals, whether prints, covering their face, or how they dispose of a weapon. "In a way they are sort of stipulating to the fact that they will get caught and are OK with leaving some evidence. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Saturday he is "ready to do major Sanctions on Russia" once all NATO countries have started "to do the same thing" and pause their purchases of oil from Moscow. He also urged NATO countries to impose "50% to 100% TARIFFS ON CHINA," which he said should be withdrawn after the Russia-Ukraine war has concluded. "China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia, and these powerful Tariffs will break that grip," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post, which he said was the text of a letter sent to all NATO nations and "the world." Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, but has so far held off from doing so. Earlier this month, the president said he was prepared to move towards a second phase of sanctioning Russia, but has not yet imposed the levies. Part of Trump's reluctance to impose the strict economic punishments may be in part because he hopes he can broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, analysts previously told CNBC. "The second reason ... is there is a sense that if Russia is defeated ... then it has no choice but to go even further all-in with China, and that potentially then would strengthen China's position," Chris Weafer, the chief executive of Moscow-based Macro-Advisory, told CNBC earlier this month. "As you know, NATO'S commitment to WIN has been far less than 100%, and the purchase of Russian Oil, by some, has been shocking!" "It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia," he continued. Hungary and Slovakia have continued to buy Russian fossil fuels, drawing criticism from Trump officials. "We want to displace all Russian gas. President Trump, America, and all the nations of the EU, we want to end the Russian-Ukraine war," U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said Friday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inflation has picked up since President Donald Trump announced new import tariffs in April, with the latest consumer price index data showing outsized increases in tariff-sensitive categories, including coffee, toys and televisions. That leaves inflation drifting farther from the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.4% in August, the biggest monthly gain since January, and is up 3.1% from a year earlier. Taken together, this means more pressure on everyday household spending. Although Trump's sweeping tariffs were first announced in April, the effects have shown up unevenly since goods move through supply chains at different rates and imports make up a larger share for some products than others. Even so, they still have a "significant impact on prices," according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Prices climbed 4.9% from April through August — equivalent to an annualized pace of about 15% — a notable jump for a category that rarely sees much inflation. The Fed's Beige Book survey in August said all regions were seeing tariff-related price increases, spanning sectors from food and retail to manufacturing and health care, with many businesses reporting they've started to pass those costs on to consumers. (These estimates include tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which remain in place while the court challenge is pending). To get a sense of where else inflation has been heading, here's a look at five of the most-impacted products since April, compared with their historical norms for the same time period over the last 10 years. Coffee prices jumped 9.8% from April to August, including a 3.6% spike last month. Poor harvests earlier this year had already tightened supply, but prices rose dramatically faster after new import tariffs took effect. Global tariffs that started at 10% in April were later raised sharply on major suppliers like Vietnam and Indonesia. That late move could keep coffee prices climbing in the months ahead, industry groups say. Jewelry and watch prices surged 5.5% in August, far above their historical average monthly gain of 0.8%. The U.S. relies heavily on imports for luxury jewelry and its components, and since April a 10% tariff has been broadly applied to this category. The U.S. has also extended tariffs to India, a leading supplier of cut and synthetic diamonds, and to Japan, which exports premium mechanical watches to the U.S. Those additional levies could push jewelry and watch prices higher in the coming months. Normally a stable category in the CPI, bananas saw an unusually sharp 4.9% increase between April and August. With virtually all supply imported from Central and South America, the U.S. market is directly exposed to tariffs, including the 10% across-the-board duty imposed in April. Reflective of that stability, Trader Joe's held its banana price at 19 cents each for more than two decades, only raising it to 23 cents in early 2024. Nearly all TVs sold in the U.S. are imported, mainly from Mexico, China and Vietnam. The summer run up in prices stands out as a break from the usual pattern for a product that typically gets cheaper over time. Toy prices rose 2.5% between April and August, the steepest four-month gain since 2021. Like TVs, toys are largely manufactured abroad, with roughly 70% of U.S. imports coming from China. Tariff classifications are not always clear, but many Chinese toy imports could be subject to tariffs around 30%, depending on classification, while some shipments from Vietnam may be taxed at higher rates. The increase is notable because toy prices have been on a long downward trajectory. Want to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You can sign up here to receive it every Friday in your inbox.) UnitedHealth Group shares have soared almost 30% since Berkshire Hathaway's disclosure in mid-August that it had purchased a bit more than 5 million shares between April 1 and June 30. Minutes before that SEC filing, UNH closed at $271.49. We don't know exactly when Berkshire did its buying during the second quarter, so we can only look at a range of possible purchase prices. (And, of course, it may have continued to buy in the third quarter. We won't know about that until mid-November.) At Q2's high of $606.36 per share, Berkshire would have paid $3.1 billion for its stake, putting it 42% into the red. Today's value of $1.8 billion is around 8% below that level. Berkshire & Co., however, are usually in it for the long haul, and there are some bullish signs for the stock, which is still down 30% year to date. After meeting with UNH's management, analysts at Morgan Stanley said, "We are incrementally positive following discussions with UNH [management] where it had conviction in the turnaround." On Friday, Morgan Stanley's Erin Wright raised her price target to $395 from $325. And on Tuesday's "Lightning Round," CNBC's Jim Cramer said he doesn't like to buy stocks that are under investigation, but "there are some people who seem to know that the worst is over." The outlook for a larger Berkshire stake, however, isn't as good. Kraft Heinz shares fell another 4.25% this week after dropping more than 2% last week in the wake of its plan to split back into two companies, essentially reversing the 2015 merger that Warren Buffett helped organize. In an unusual move for the normally passive investor, Buffett told CNBC he's "disappointed" the company went ahead with those plans, even though it knew he, representing KHC's largest shareholder, opposed a split. CNBC.com's Yun Li quotes Gordon Haskett's Don Bilson as saying, "Beyond any worries that investors might have with the plan itself, they must also grapple with the possibility that Buffett will now dump his stock." Because its stake is more than 10%, any sales would have to be reported publicly within two business days. That's down from #5 last year even through his estimated net worth remained unchanged at $150 billion. Last fall, his Thanksgiving gifts to the family foundations totaled $1.1 billion. If Buffett had held onto all the shares he's given away since 2006, he would now be worth approximately $350 billion. That would put him in the #2 slot behind Elon Musk's $428 billion on the annual list, which uses stock values as of Sept. 9. The next day, Oracle shares soared on a strong earnings report, adding around $100 billion to Larry Ellison's net worth. Tesla shares have also moved higher since then. As a result, Buffett would be nearly tied with Ellison's $352 billion in our hypothetical real-time ranking, with Musk still well ahead at $463 billion.

Speaking publicly for the first time since his killing, Erika Kirk said Friday that Turning Point's "American Comeback Tour" would continue over the fall and that the organization's annual "AmericaFest" conference would also go ahead in December. Spencer Cox confirmed remarks made by President Donald Trump on Friday morning that law enforcement had a suspect in custody. "Ladies and gentlemen, we got him," Cox said during a Friday morning news conference. Officials said the suspect was named Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old resident of Utah. Robinson was taken into custody in Washington County, which is roughly three and a half hours away from where Kirk was shot. Cox said that family members and a friend helped turn Robinson in. "The family member referenced a recent incident in which Robinson came to dinner prior to September 10, and in that conversation with another family member, Robinson mentioned Charlie Kirk was coming to UVU," Cox said. "The rifle had a scope mounted on top of it," Cox said. A fired casing was inscribed, "Notices bulges OWO what's this?" adding that there were arrow symbols alongside the wording. Cox said that on Thursday evening, one of Robinson's family members reached out to a family friend with information that Robinson had "confessed to them or implied to them" that he had fatally shot Charlie Kirk. Once law enforcement had Robinson's name, Cox said officers were able to connect him to the crime scene. Investigators reviewed campus security footage that showed Robinson arriving in a gray Dodge Challenger at roughly 8:29 am local time on September 10, the day Kirk was shot. In those messages, Cox said, Robinson said that he needed "to retrieve a rifle from the drop point." FBI Director Kash Patel said the suspect was taken into custody on Thursday night at 10 p.m. Utah time. Trump said that someone "very close to" the suspect had provided information to law enforcement that aided in his capture, adding the tipster was a "person involved with law enforcement, but was a person of faith. In his remarks, Cox thanked "the family members of Tyler Robinson who did the right thing in this case and were able to bring him into law enforcement." He did not specify which family members were involved. The manhunt for a suspect in Kirk's shooting extended multiple days and saw the FBI ask for the public's assistance in identifying a "person of interest" captured on camera. "We are asking for the public's help identifying this person of interest in connection with the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University," the FBI's Salt Lake City field office wrote in a Thursday afternoon post on X. On Thursday, the agency released six photos of the person of interest as well as video footage. "Around 12 p.m. Mountain Time on September 10, 2025, the subject climbed up to a rooftop; after he shot and killed Charlie Kirk, he jumped off and ran away," the agency wrote. Earlier in the day, authorities said they had recovered a "high-powered, bolt-action rifle" they believe was used to kill Kirk in a wooded area near the campus. The suspect was able to "blend in" well with the Utah Valley University crowd that had gathered to hear Kirk speak, they added. Kirk was rushed to an area hospital after being shot in the neck but died from his injuries on Wednesday afternoon. President Donald Trump and scores of political and business leaders have praised Kirk's legacy of building youth support for the conservative movement. Mason also asked people to stop harassing the two individuals who had since been released. Trump said that he would posthumously award Kirk with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. "Charlie was a giant of his generation, a champion of liberty, and an inspiration to millions and millions of people," Trump said during an event at the Pentagon marking the September 11th anniversary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Oracle's blowout earnings report, OpenAI was a key catalyst due to a massive amount of money the artificial intelligence startup expects to spend on cloud computing technology in the coming years. A week earlier, Broadcom shares popped almost 10% after the chipmaker and software vendor said it forged a $10 billion deal to build custom processors for a customer that analysts said was OpenAI. Among tech's megacaps, Microsoft has the closest link to OpenAI, having invested more than $13 billion in the company and serving as its key cloud partner for six years. Nvidia's march to becoming the world's most valuable company is intimately tied to OpenAI, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) sit at the heart of large language model development and are essential for running big AI workloads. Those four companies alone — Oracle, Broadcom, Microsoft and Nvidia — have seen their combined market caps swell by over $4.5 trillion since OpenAI burst into public view with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. And those gains are a big reason why the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have sustained sharp rallies, with both benchmarks closing at a record on Friday. OpenAI's outsized influence has some market experts understandably concerned. "While we love ChatGPT, OpenAI is still a not for profit limited in its ability to raise capital," said Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. In its quarterly earnings report late Tuesday, Oracle said it signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers during the period. One of those was with OpenAI, which said previously that it agreed to develop 4.5 gigawatts of U.S. data center capacity with Oracle. Investors knew, based on a filing with the SEC in June, that Oracle signed a $30 billion cloud contract with an unnamed company that's set to begin in two years. CNBC confirmed a Wall Street Journal report from Wednesday that OpenAI has agreed to spend $300 billion in computing power over about five years, starting in 2027. In the two trading days after its historic pop, Oracle's stock retreated, dropping more than 6% on Thursday and another 5% on Friday, as other investors began sharing Luria's concerns. The new revelations about OpenAI's massive cloud commitment provided a clearer sense of Oracle's expanding backlog. Oracle said its performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, surged 359% from a year earlier to to $455 billion. Luria said the concentration of Oracle's backlog with a single customer "significantly reduces" enthusiasm, particularly if "more than 90% came from OpenAI." Oracle didn't respond to a request for comment. OpenAI has made big commitments to several other cloud providers, including CoreWeave and Google, and reportedly plans to put $19 billion toward Stargate, a project President Donald Trump announced in January to bolster AI infrastructure investments in the U.S. Stargate is a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, which is separately leading a planned $40 billion investment in OpenAI. Luria said the takeaway is that "Sam Altman has the gumption to sign very large checks without needing to worry about whether those can ever be cashed." While OpenAI will be losing money for the foreseeable future, the company is expecting revenue growth to continue at a breakneck pace. After hitting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue in June, OpenAI is on pace for that number to reach $125 billion by 2029, CNBC confirmed. The company said its nonprofit parent will continue to have oversight over the business and will own an equity stake of more than $100 billion as the commercial entity becomes a public benefit corporation. Byron Deeter, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, told CNBC's "Money Movers" that he's still skeptical of Oracle's prospects in AI. The company has spent years trying to play catchup in cloud infrastructure, where it trails Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Deeter said Oracle remains a "B-level hyperscaler" without meaningful positions in AI software or chips. "Two days ago, we all thought Oracle was essentially nowhere in AI," Deeter said, following the earnings report. "They announce this mega-deal, people think they're the next great hyperscaler – and I don't buy that part." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What's old is new again — and, sometimes, more expensive. The resale market has reached new heights this year: One in three American luxury consumers has bought or sold on a resale platform, according to McKinsey's 2025 State of Luxury report. And some shoppers are buying with an eye toward investment. Online thrift store ThredUp found in a survey about the secondhand market that 47% of shoppers considered the resale value of clothing before making a purchase. A new report from luxury consignment shop The RealReal looks at which items have maintained their price over time. Bone Cuff or Row Margaux bag — have seen their resale prices skyrocket over the past few years, certain products are "classics" whose value "holds strong," the report said. With tariffs causing luxury price increases, there's reason to believe their value will continue to climb on the secondhand market. "The domestic closet, there's $200 billion trapped in there, and as pricing increases in the primary market, our pricing algorithms follow," The RealReal CEO Rati Sahi Levesque said on last month's earnings call. "We benefit and see pricing increase as well." While even the CEO of Rolex urges against buying luxury goods purely as an investment, if you are keen on an accessory with an ROI, these five items have "consistent resale-value growth," The RealReal determined based on sales data since 2021. Launched in 1930, the Louis Vuitton Speedy handbag — which has been made in numerous sizes and patterns over the decades — is an enduring silhouette. The Louis Vuitton retail price of a brand-new Speedy starts at $1,920. On The RealReal, they are selling for between $380 and $13,500, with pricing dependent on the model, condition, and size. Given their long-standing appeal and limited availability, the bags command, on average, 1.7 times their retail price on the resale market, Bernstein found. The RealReal's current selection ranges in price from $9,450 to $350,000. The latter is for a rare Himalayan crocodile version with diamond-encrusted hardware. It's a hefty price, but not as much as the most expensive Birkin ever sold at The RealReal: a $385,000 model sold at its West Hollywood store. The secondary watch market has become a popular asset class. While it has declined over the past few years, certain models and brands — particularly Rolex — have maintained impressive resale value. "The Datejust remains a timeless entry point, attracting both first-time buyers and seasoned collectors," Bob's Watches CEO Paul Altieri previously told Business Insider. Van Cleef & Arpels' four-leaf clover motif has been a signature of the brand for decades. Routinely called out on parent company Richemont's earnings calls, the Alhambra has become a worldwide status symbol. "It's probably one of the most important jewelry lines in the world, but we feel it's far from having reached its full potential," Richemont CEO Nicolas Bos said in May. On The RealReal, prices for Alhambra pieces have increased 20% since 2021 and range from $1,425 to $165,000.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But in a world where bullish forecasts are the consensus among Wall Street's top equity strategists, it can be prudent to heed Rosenberg's warnings. While his predictions usually don't play out, there's no denying that the economist sufficiently shows his work, providing relevant data that ought to give investors pause. In a recent note to clients, Rosenberg provided some concerning numbers on where the S&P 500's forward returns could be headed, given current valuations. The index's Shiller cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio is hovering around 37.5. The measure smooths out business cycles by comparing current stock prices to a 10-year rolling average of earnings. It's the third-most expensive level of all-time, behind peaks in 2021 and 2022. Valuations are usually reliable predictors of long-term stock market performance. Last year, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs strategists said that high valuations would lead to relatively weak returns for the market over the coming decade. Rosenberg's data, however, shows that when the market gets this historically expensive — though, granted, it has only happened twice before — one-year forward returns have been negative. "It's the only cutoff point where every single time is negative," Rosenberg said in an interview with Business Insider on Thursday. Valuations alone aren't why Rosenberg is skeptical of the rally. He pointed to initial jobless claims rising to 263,000 last week, worse than economists expected and at levels that should trigger downward pressure on payroll growth. "What we know arithmetically is that the hiring rate today is so low that once you cross above 240,000 on claims, it triggers a negative impulse on nonfarm payrolls, which I think is what we're going to see when the September data roll out early October," he said. The fact that stocks continue to punch through all-time highs despite these warning signs — showing heightened investor sentiment — is one clue that stocks are in bubble territory, Rosenberg said. "This is what a euphoric state looks like we're seeing it in real time," he added. "We are in a gigantic price bubble that is ongoing. And you know it's a price bubble when prices move up in the face of negative fundamentals."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Germany this week played host to one of the world's biggest auto shows — but in the heartland of Europe's auto industry, it was buzzy Chinese electric car companies looking to outshine some of the region's biggest brands on their home turf. The IAA Mobility conference in Munich was packed full of companies with huge stands showing off their latest cars and technology. Among some of the biggest displays were those from Chinese electric car companies, underscoring their ambitions to expand beyond China. Europe has become a focal point for the Asian firms. It's a market where the traditional automakers are seen to be lagging in the development of electric vehicles, even as they ramp up releases of new cars. "The current growth of Xpeng globally is faster than we have expected," He Xiaopeng, the CEO of Xpeng told CNBC in an interview this week. Chinese carmakers who spoke to CNBC at the IAA show signaled their ambitious expansion plans. Xpeng's He said in an interview that the company is looking to launch its mass-market Mona series in Europe next year. In China, Xpeng's Mona cars start at the equivalent of just under $17,000. Bringing this to Europe would add some serious price competition. Meanwhile, Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) is targeting rapid growth of its sales in Europe. Wei Haigang, president of GAC International, told CNBC that the company aims to sell around 3,000 cars in Europe this year and at least 50,000 units by 2027. Leapmotor was also in attendance with their own stand. There are signs that Chinese players have made early in roads into Europe. Many of the Chinese car firms have positioned themselves as technology companies, much like Tesla, and their cars highlight that. Many of the electric vehicles have big screens equipped with flashy interfaces and voice assistants. And in a bid to lure buyers, some companies have included additional gadgets. This is one way that the Chinese players sought to differentiate themselves from legacy brands. "The chances of success for Chinese automakers are strong, especially as they have an edge in terms of affordability, battery technology, and production scale," Counterpoint's Ali said. BMW, like the Chinese players, had a big focus on technology by talking up its so-called "superbrain architecture," which replaces hardware with a centralized computer system. Volkswagen and French auto firm Renault also showed off some new electric cars. BMW's new iX3 is based on the electric vehicle platform it first debuted two years ago. Meanwhile, Chinese EV makers have been quick in bringing out and launching newer models. "A commitment to legacy structures and incrementalism has slowed its ability to build and leverage a robust EV ecosystem, leaving it behind fast moving rivals," Tammy Madsen, professor of management at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University, said of BMW. While European autos have a strong brand history and their CEOs acknowledged and welcomed the competition this week in interviews with CNBC, the Chinese are not letting up. "Europe's automakers still hold significant brand value and legacy. The challenge for them lies in achieving production at scale and adopting new technologies faster," Counterpoint's Ali said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company sent out emails notifying employees that it was planning to downsize its team of generalist AI tutors, according to multiple messages viewed by Business Insider. This strategic pivot will take effect immediately," the email read. "As part of this shift in focus, we no longer need most generalist AI tutor positions and your employment with xAI will conclude." The main Slack room used by data annotators had more than 1,500 members on Friday afternoon; screenshots viewed by Business Insider Friday evening showed that number down to a little over 1,000, with that number continuing to decline over the course of reporting this story. After publication, an xAI spokesperson pointed Business Insider to a company post on X saying it plans to "surge our Specialist AI tutor team by 10x," and sent a link to open roles on its careers page. Specialist AI tutors at xAI are adding huge value. We will immediately surge our Specialist AI tutor team by 10x!We are hiring across domains like STEM, finance, medicine, safety, and many more. Come join us to help build truth-seeking AGI!https://t.co/htpc2RijLG The layoff notices were sent out only a few days after several senior-level employees, including the team's former head, recently had their Slack accounts deactivated, Business Insider reported earlier this week. In the days that followed, workers were pulled into one-on-ones to review their responsibilities, projects, and achievements, nine workers told Business Insider. XAI told workers on Thursday night to prepare for a reorganization of the data annotation team. In a team-wide announcement on Thursday night, the company asked some workers to drop everything and focus on a series of tests to determine their roles at the company going forward, asking staff to complete them by Friday morning West Coast time. The tests would be used to sort annotators and their supervisors based on their strengths and interests, according to a screenshot viewed by Business Insider. The notice for tutors to prepare for testing was posted by Diego Pasini, who ten workers said recently became the team's leader. Pasini asked workers to take at least one test by the following morning. Pasini joined xAI in January, according to his LinkedIn profile. He is "on leave" from his undergraduate studies at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, his LinkedIn shows. XAI divides its teams between STEM, coding, finance, legal, and media specialties, as well as a large pool of generalist tutors who are tasked with a wide range of assignments, from annotating video and audio to writing. Two workers said the STEM and coding tests took place on CodeSignal, a skills assessment platform, while other tests were hosted on Google Forms. One worker expressed frustration with the short time span that was given for the tests, according to a screenshot viewed by Business Insider. The worker's Slack account was deactivated shortly after, multiple workers said.Update: September 13, 2025 — This story has been updated to include a statement from xAI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Keith Rabois, cofounder and new chairman at Opendoor Technologies, says the company is so "bloated" it could cut the vast majority of its workforce. Rabois, whose return to the company's board of directors was announced Thursday, outlined several changes that are needed at Opendoor in an interview with CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Friday. We don't need more than 200 of them," Rabois said, adding, "the company is completely bloated." Opendoor, which buys and sells homes, is currently making waves as the latest meme stock beloved by retail traders. The stock got another boost on Thursday when the company announced cofounders Rabois and Eric Wu were rejoining the board and that Kaz Nejatian, COO of Shopify, was appointed CEO. At market close on Friday, the stock was up 470% year-to-date. Rabois, who is also managing director at the VC firm Khosla Ventures, told CNBC Opendoor's culture was "broken," citing remote work and diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. That doesn't work," he said, adding that the company also went down a "DEI path." We're back to merit and excellence," Rabois said. Opendoor did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Rabois's comments are part of a larger trend of tech leaders lamenting remote work and rolling out return-to-office mandates, which business leaders have also noted as a way to reduce headcounts without layoffs. Several prominent tech companies have also rolled back DEI efforts, including Amazon, Google, and Meta.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At Tesla, a long list of extracurriculars seems to pay off. Tesla's chair, Robyn Denholm, appeared on "Bloomberg Talks" on Friday to discuss the new $1 trillion compensation package its board crafted for CEO Elon Musk. Beyond the money, though, Denholm said that Musk's involvement in other ventures motivates him to deliver for Tesla. "But having worked with him now for 11 years, it actually benefits Tesla with him doing things that are not in the mission of Tesla outside of Tesla, both from a resource perspective, but also from a motivation perspective." Outside Tesla, Musk's endeavors include serving as CEO of aerospace company SpaceX, the CEO of brain-computer interface company Neuralink, the CEO of Grok maker xAI, and playing a major part in running X, alongside managing a nonprofit dedicated to renewable energy called the Musk Foundation. What's been less appealing to Tesla's board, however, is Musk's involvement in politics. In a proxy statement filed with the SEC, Tesla's board said it sought "assurances that Musk's involvement with the political sphere would wind down in a timely manner." Denholm added that Musk has the same right to be political as any private citizen, but his days in the administration are behind him. "What he does from a personal perspective in terms of his political motivations, et cetera, is up to him." Denholm's stance is more tepid than some of the company's more outspoken investors and observers — many of whom say Musk needs to rein in his focus or leave. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, known as one of Tesla's most bullish observers on Wall Street, said on X in July that Tesla's board of directors needs to establish some "ground rules" for Musk after he said he would launch a new political party called the America Party. Ross Gerber, an early Tesla backer, said in April that Musk had gone too far — another executive would be better to helm the company. It could be anybody, any CEO, somebody who's in the middle, who is a great communicator, who refocuses people on what Tesla really does," Gerber said, adding that the company needed to take measures to reorient its identity around things other than Musk. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.</p>
