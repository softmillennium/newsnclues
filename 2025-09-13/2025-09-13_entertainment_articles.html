                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Oscar winner shared a short behind-the-scenes clip of her and co-star Sandra Bullock walking away from the cameras on a sun-soaked meadow. Bullock, also an Academy Award winner, can be heard saying, “Profile shot? Let's do a profile shot,” as Kidman bursts into laughter and embraces her. 'The Conjuring: Last Rites' Review: A Frothy Return To First Film's Aesthetic Pleasures A sequel to the cult classic 1998 original about two polar opposite sisters who are descended from a long line of witches, negotiations for original stars Kidman and Bullock to return as Gillian and Sally Owens, respectively, were first reported in June 2024. Praised for its feminist themes, soundtrack and genre-bending nature, the film followed the two family members and their aunts as they reckoned with the Owens curse, which dooms any man who falls in love with them. The sequel to the spooky movie is slated for release Sept. 18, 2026, with original cast Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing also returning as Aunt Jet and Aunt Frances, the matriarchs who took in Sally and Gillian after their parents died. Meanwhile, newcomers include Joey King, Lee Pace, Maisie Williams, Xolo Maridueña and Solly McLeod. Character details for the new faces are under wraps, as Deadline exclusively reported. Susanne Bier directs the followup from a script by Akiva Goldsman, a co-writer on the original, and Georgia Pritchett (Veep, Succession). The original film, helmed by Griffin Dunne, was based on Alice Hoffman's 1995 novel of the same name, grossing more than $47 million stateside. Hoffman has since published two prequels to that book, as well as a 2021 sequel called The Book of Magic. Though plot details about Practical Magic 2 are scant, producer Denise Di Novi told Entertainment Weekly last year it would draw heavily from the source material.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the Netflix documentary aka Charlie Sheen, Director Andrew Renzi (Pepsi, Where's My Jet?) was able to chronicle the rise and fall of the Two and a Half Men actor by relying on old family films, interviews with pals like Chris Tucker and Sean Penn and an extraordinary chat with Sheen's former drug dealer Marco. “I take it very seriously that I'm making something that ultimately creates a legacy piece for somebody,” Renzi tells Deadline. “This is the Charlie Sheen documentary, and there probably can't be another one. He has been such a privilege to work with because he had no editorial control over this thing, but he's able to look at it and say, “all right, good, bad, all the things. This is an honest portrait of me that I feel like was representative of my POV, which was what I chose to do.” It's a nice feeling to be able to walk away and say, okay, he's good with it. Bill Maher Denounces People Who "Mocked" Or "Justified" Charlie Kirk's Assassination: "Very Ugly Week In America With Violence Of All Kinds" Jon Cryer Says He Was Paid "A Third" Of What Charlie Sheen Made For 'Two and a Half Men' Here, Renzi explains how long the doc was in the works, why family members didn't participate, and how Marco of all people helped Sheen to get off crack. ANDREW RENZI I wanted to enter the celebrity doc conversation through someone who felt more like me, maybe a controversial figure. We spent about eight months to a year getting to know each other before we shot a frame of the film. There was a long process of really figuring out whether this was even going to be a good idea. So from start to finish, it was about two years. I certainly didn't know eight-years-sober Charlie Sheen. That played a big role in us telling this story. DEADLINE How did you come up with the title? RENZI Everyone has their own idea of who Charlie is. Everyone has their own idea of what they remember from him or what they want him to be like. I just found that to be a really provocative concept because a lot of this documentary seemed to be him unpacking that himself. I just find it to be a really interesting detail. It's like the guy's not even Charlie Sheen, legally. DEADLINE Did you do two parts just so you can use the phrase Part Deux, a callback to Sheen's 1993 film Hot Shots! RENZI Listen, if there was three parts, I would've done the same thing. There were a lot of iterations with this project. I had a feature at one point in my head. But the two parts were really born out of the fact that I wanted part one to feel like a romanticized version of what drug addiction can look like to a drug addict, like a Hollywood rocket ship … sex, drugs, and rock & roll recreations, almost make it feel sensational to a degree. And then in part two, have it all fall apart, just really peel back what it actually looks like to be in the depths of addiction. DEADLINE You started with the Two and a Half Men theme and Jon Cryer saying, “I'm not here to build him up or tear him down.” Why was that your start? And the disarming nature of someone like Jon Cryer starting this thing felt good to me rather than just launching right into the chaos. I also really love the thematic concept of whether this a good idea. Is this a bad idea for me to be here sitting in front of you telling the story because of the cycle that has been his life? I just found that to be an urgent message for the doc. Is this going to open Pandora's box again? DEADLINE Then you kicked off the anecdote where he actually flew a plane on his honeymoon! RENZI That to me felt like the most Charlie Sheen in a nutshell that I could have possibly imagined. Here's a guy who's just married, on his honeymoon, drunk off his ass, and being given the steering wheel to a plane with 400 people behind him. That sort of power and mind fuck can't be quantified by anyone else in the world. That is such a specific experience for him to have. It was a power that no one else could experience. If anyone ever had any questions about why a guy didn't get sober sooner, there's your answer. DEADLINE You had a treasure trove of family super 8 footage to draw from. His sister was the family archivist and quite literally just had a box of undeveloped film. So I got to edit together Charlie Sheen's directorial efforts at age 8 as though he was doing it. I mean, there's Sean Penn setting up camera angles for Charlie at age 10. There was a different iteration at one point of this project that dove a lot deeper into Charlie and Chris Penn's relationship. Not everyone's a little kid though that gets to make super 8 movies because they were on the set of Apocalypse Now. DEADLINE You didn't delve into Chris Penn, but you spent some time on Charlie's friendship with Nicholas Cage. RENZI I think Nic Cage was a turning point. It was that moment in Charlie's life where he became a superstar that also was going to march to the beat of his own drum. Not many people knew they had this pocket of time together. It felt like such a fun way for the audience to be like, “well, yeah, if you're going to become a superstar, who better to party with than Nic Cage?” It just set the tone for a lot of Charlie's behaviors to come. DEADLINE It's extraordinary that you got his old drug dealer Marco to talk. I had many questions about how he cleaned up the crack at the end to help Charlie get sober. RENZI Apparently it's just extra baking soda every time. Not to give too much of an infomercial on how to cook crack, but you mix baking soda and cocaine together and you create crack. DEADLINE I can't believe you had video of the moment when Charlie found out he was fired from Two and a Half Men. Eventually Charlie was like, “listen, you're jumping out of bushes all the time on me. Just come with me.” And he ended up working for him and being a videographer for him at all times. This guy ended up with Charlie at the worst time of his life. We got to find the footage.” No one knew if it existed anymore. It turned out to be in a storage unit in Colorado or something, and this guy just handed it over to me and allowed us to use it. DEADLINE What was it like to listen to him discuss how his time on Two and a Half Men went up in flames? It was a little bit of like, “oh my God, was that me?” I think of all the things, having to look back at that moment in his life was the hardest. He really struggled with his behavior, the aggression, the sort of feeling like he was being a bully. I think that made him feel the ick probably more than anything. I think shame is a thing that will haunt anybody who has experiences they're not proud of. He didn't make this documentary as an amends because he's been living those amends for the past eight years. DEADLINE Why do you think Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez declined to participate? RENZI I actually watched the movie with them, so I got to sit next to Martin while he watched. It was one of the most intimidating moments of my life, but it was really just a function of Martin feeling as though Charlie's message to his father was so present and maybe more available than him sitting for an interview. I don't know if Martin wanted to sit down with me and relive all of that stuff. He felt like, this is Charlie's moment to tell his story. I mean, that's a dad who really wants to just look out for his son and himself. And then Emilio, it just felt like he saw this as Charlie's moment and Charlie was able to finally tell his story the way that he wanted to tell it. And so it was nice for me to know that it had nothing to do with whatever perceived rift there might be. It was because of the love they all have for each other. DEADLINE Do you think Charlie can truly explain why he's an addict? RENZI My perspective is he is arguably, at least from a public figure perspective, the biggest emblem of an addict that's still alive. For the past eight years, he was not only just figuring that out for himself, but not trying to do the thing that he had always done … that's to re-enter the public conversation, get another role. He truly went away to figure this out. I felt like when I was sitting across from him, I always thought, this is a person who's honest, who maybe isn't going to give everybody what they want, but he's here and he's present and he's telling his own truth. That to me is a very specific type of success story. For a story that could be this dark, what a gift to be able to recount some of these things, but with a tone that doesn't need to be wildly investigative and uncomfortable and unsettling.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bill Maher addressed the shooting death of right-wing activist and Trump ally Charlie Kirk during his Real Time episode on Friday. And then today in Congress, because Charlie Kirk got assassinated, [Colorado Rep.] Lauren Boebert stood up and said, ‘We need to have a prayer.' As if praying out loud gets big results,” Maher said during his monologue, via Variety. Maher also took President Trump to task for his remarks as political divisiveness continues to ramp up in the aftermath of Kirk's death. And he said, ‘I know this is going to get me in trouble, but I could care less,” Maher said, eliciting laughter from the audience. During Maher's discussion with his guests, Shapiro noted the disparity of viewpoints among Gen Z when it comes to violent reactions to speech. He said that a poll revealed “only 57 percent of Gen Z say there is no excuse for violence in response to speech.” Alberta, a self-described “sparring partner from a distance” to Kirk, commented that “the response to this has not been shock and horror and a reversal of the trend line in these polls. If anything, it seems as though — particularly to Ben's point among younger voters — that this is becoming mainstreamed and becoming acceptable.” When you read some of the comments from people, they really are in such a bubble that they don't understand that it's happening on both sides,” Maher said. “The only way this starts to get better is if both sides admit, ‘OK, let's not have this debate about who started it. Let's not debate about who's worse because, plainly, both sides do it now.' The suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old from Utah, was taken into custody on Friday. Trump announced the news Friday morning on Fox, saying that “they have the person they wanted,” and that he just heard about it “five minutes before I walked in.” On Real Time, Maher and Shapiro also debated about reporting on the speculative political viewpoints of the suspected shooter. “We do know that this kid was of the political left,” Shapiro began, citing reports from Tablet Magazine and The Guardian, which walked back its report on Sept. 12 with an editor's note. The Guardian's note reads: “Editor's note: This article was updated on 12 September 2025 to remove quotes after the verified source who attended high school with Tyler Robinson said after publication that they could not accurately remember details of their relationship.” Protest Singer Jesse Welles Laments the Death of Charlie Kirk in New Song 'Charlie' Bill Maher Decries Political Responses After Charlie Kirk's Death: ‘Let's Not Debate About Who's Worse' People Are Losing Their Jobs for Criticizing Slain ‘Free Speech' Advocate Charlie Kirk The internet is undefeated in getting it wrong to begin with.” Kirk — who was a guest on Maher's Club Random podcast in April — was the co-founder of Turning Point USA, which was formed to foster a culture of conservatism on school campuses around the nation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NFL star Joe Burrow's charitable organization has removed a board member over his remarks addressing the murder of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. Hamilton County municipal court Judge Ted Berry, who was first elected to serve Cincinnati and the surrounding areas in 2005, has faced criticism for messages that he posted to Facebook after Kirk was gunned down at a Utah Valley University event on Wednesday. Among Berry's comments were “Rest in Hatred & Division!” and “How's he feel about gun violence & gun control in Hell, now?” as published by local outlets including the Cincinnati Enquirer. TV Ratings: Cable News Spikes With Coverage of Charlie Kirk Murder “We have terminated an advisory board member that made inappropriate remarks in light of recent events and they are no longer associated with the Foundation,” read the group's statement. In a statement to the Enquirer, Berry said he does not condone violence. We remain committed to accountability and respect for all. Berry, whom the Hamilton County Democratic Party endorsed, has previously said he will retire in January when his term ends. The charity was established in 2022 to help children dealing with mental health issues and food insecurity.

The 2025 edition of Farm Aid — marking the festival's 40th anniversary — will feature headliners Willie Nelson, Neil Young, John Mellencamp, Dave Matthews, Kenny Chesney, Margo Price and Billy Strings, among others. The event is expected to draw a crowd of approximately 50,000 fans. “We look forward to celebrating that spirit on September 20 — alongside farmers, workers, advocates, artists and fans — in a day of music and community that honors this shared history,” the statement concluded. On Friday (Sept. 12), Farm Aid revealed that Nelson, the festival's co-founder and president, had personally spoken with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in an effort to help resolve the situation. “I spoke with @mngovernor, and I'm grateful that he understands what's at stake for farmers and Farm Aid,” Nelson said in a statement on Instagram. We both know that, ultimately, it's up to the University to do the right thing, and soon, so that Farm Aid 40 can go forward.” But on Sept. 4, members of Teamsters Local 320 — which represents public sector employees including custodial, maintenance, food service and sanitation staff — voted to reject a proposed contract extension. “We urge the University of Minnesota to settle this contract quickly so that Farm Aid 40 can proceed as intended — to celebrate four decades of farmers, music, and solidarity. Since being founded in 1985, Farm Aid has raised more than $85 million “to promote a strong and resilient family farm system of agriculture,” according to its website.

It's an overly didactic touch that conveys little beyond what Carmen Maura's performance as Maria, an elderly woman living alone in Tangier, already tells the audience. And, when Maria's daughter Clara (Marta Etura) arrives to drop a bombshell — that she needs to sell the family home, and Maria must either come with her to Madrid or live the remainder of her life in a nursing community — the way Maura's face flashes from devastation and horror to anger and steel makes it all too clear how hard she'll fight to maintain this life.

Touzani based the character of Maria in part on her own Spanish grandmother, and she gives Maura — a great actress best known to American audiences for her work in Pedro Almodóvar movies like “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown” and “Volver” — a wonderful part to embody. However, the movie around her proves a lot less interesting than it's main character. Frequently safe and only skimming the surface of the complicated emotions its premise raises, “Calle Malaga” is likable but never quite interesting. Warmly shot with sun-draped lenses by Virginie Surdej and soundtracked by an overbearingly sentimental score by Freya Arde, “Calle Malaga” introduces the threat on Maria's house as a tragedy before quickly pivoting to a more cheery, sentimental story, one in which the woman finds community and even love through the hardship. Crafty and resistant, Maria agrees to go to the retirement center and let Clara put the house on the market and return to her family in Madrid. It also helps her buy back her old furniture from handsome antiques dealer Abslam (Ahmed Boulane), with whom she sparks a tentative romance. The romantic subplot proves the most charming thread “Calle Malaga” has to offer, thanks to Maura and Boulane's performances. There's a wistful sense of longing between them even before things turn explicitly romantic, and for a relatively tame and breezy film it does get genuinely hot in its depiction of their relationship. Occasionally their interactions work to funny effect, like when she extolls Abslam's performance in bed to her silent friend, but the film stumbles when it tries to build real emotional stakes around their bond. Although she's introduced with very valid reasons for selling the apartment — she just went through a divorce, she's struggling financially, she needs the money to buy a new home for her kids — “Calle Malaga” has little interest in giving her real interiority or taking her concerns seriously. Her strained relationship with her mother has little nuance, and the unsatisfying, abrupt ending that leaves the two still at odds proves curiously sour for an otherwise gentle movie. Lack of nuance plagues “Calle Malaga” in general, and it's particularly apparent in how thin the neighborhood Maria loves so dearly actually is on screen. There's little sense of what her life in this city, as a Spanish woman around mostly Moroccans, looks like. Without Maura's performance, there'd be no specificity to speak of. “Calle Malaga” premiered at the Venice Film Festival.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Life coach and former MTV star Kelley Wolf is facing a new legal hurdle, according to court documents obtained by multiple outlets on September 12, 2025. According to People, the estranged wife of actor Scott Wolf, whose most recent roles have been on FOX's “Doc” and Hallmark's “A Merry Scottish Christmas,” was charged with a new misdemeanor over accusations that she tried to contact one of their three kids. Despite a temporary protective order filed on August 28 that barred Kelley from “any direct or indirect contact” with Scott or their three kids, a new court filing claims she tried to reach her 12-year-old son via a friend's phone two days later, per Us Weekly. On September 12, Kelley told People in a statement that she was “utterly shocked” by the latest charge. Scott, who was granted sole physical custody of his and Kelley's kids in late June, filed a Statement of Probable Cause, People reported, claiming that Kelley contacted him on August 30 by “using a friend's phone and attempting to contact her son through a friend's son.” A summons for Kelley to appear in court on November 7 was also filed, per Us Weekly. Regarding facing her fourth charge, Kelley said in an exclusive statement to People on September 12, “I am utterly shocked (for) the unabating aggressive use of a legal system and possibly more.” Kelley wound up going sooner, checking in on September 7, People reported. But one day later, the outlet revealed Kelley had already left and was staying at a hotel. The Wolfs then attended an emergency hearing on September 10, requested by Scott because, he said, Kelley had continued to disregard court orders. The judge also ordered that Scott pay for some of her legal fees. On September 11, Kelley returned to Instagram, posting several Stories reviewed by EntertainmentNow. She has since been placed under two involuntary holds by police, including one three days after her divorce announcement. Her August arrest stemmed from a slew of social media posts in which police said she disclosed others' personal information, including one with Scott's phone number, per Us Weekly. On August 15, Scott broke his silence after a summer of hardships, telling People that his “continued hope is to have this most difficult chapter of our family's lives remain as private as possible, however, the well being of my children is at stake, and that will always be my priority.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maybe, says Michael McKean, who plays David St. Hubbins: “If you only halfway exist, then vanishing altogether is not a big chore.” McKean, whose many other roles include Charles McGill on Better Call Saul and a recent Broadway stint in a Glengarry Glen Ross revival, recently hopped on a Zoom to talk four decades of Spinal Tap. How did that feel?We got to work on it a few years ago and met every day. We'd get into talking about old show business and prehistoric TV, part of which was Harry [Shearer, who plays Derek Smalls]. Harry's been doing it since he was eight years old — he was on The Jack Benny Show. Chris [Guest] and I for somewhat less, but still we were the first generation of TV babies. Eventually we put together an idea for the notion of one more concert. The guys aren't speaking, but they're gonna be thrown together for one more concert. Originally the idea was Ian Faith's widow. Kerry [Godliman] was obviously the best one, but she was way too young to be a widow. And she said, “How about I'm his daughter?” And we said, “Done.”How was the actual production different from the original film?It turned out to be a lot of fun. Shooting in New Orleans was a lot of fun. And we would watch dailies every single day. We went through this kind of winnowing down process and we killed a few darlings and a couple of the ugly children that we knew probably weren't gonna make it anyway. But it was just a very different process. The first time we saw any kind of assemblage of the film was when Rob [Reiner, the director] put together his 90-minute version, and there were things missing. We never wanted them to be cartoons. We really wanted 'em to be real people. The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time Did themes of aging and mortality seep into your own thinking?Oh, absolutely. There's that moment when [the character] Simon suggests that one of us die and that would really sell this thing, and we have to actually think about it. David St. Hubbins has said that rock & roll keeps you young, but only if you die young. Otherwise, you're just a regular old person. How early did you start to see the absurd side of rock & roll?Kind of immediately, when I was seven years old. I think there's probably less hubris in this film 'cause we're already a little bit defeated and ragged because we've been around so long.Did “Big Bottom” partly come from “Fat Bottomed Girls”?Absolutely, by Queen. We thought, “Yeah, it does make the rockin' world go round…” We just made it about one specific, made-up person. We really wrote that one all together. Once we got the notion that we're all playing basses and there's primarily lower-end, the song is about itself. Harry Shearer on Life as Spinal Tap's Derek Smalls — and His 'Simpsons' Future ‘Spinal Tap II: The End Continues': This Sequel Goes to Two Christopher Guest on the Birth of Spinal Tap's Nigel Tufnel What's your memory of creating the Stonehenge gag?I had read that some act had wanted to do a big Stonehenge set and they built it and couldn't get it in the venue, and I thought, maybe we do this other thing, where it doesn't work for another reason. It just seemed like a funny payoff to have this little tiny thing emerge. What does it feel like to look in the mirror when you're dressed as David St. Hubbins? It's not like this sudden jump from 1984 to now — you've been this guy many times.People mainly wanna talk to me about that. Weirdly, that was not a hit, but Clue was a big home-video thing, and people in their fifties are telling me, “That was my favorite movie when I was a kid.” But people recognize me for Tap. I think we know that he's a very lonely guy We did a lot of interview stuff that's not in the film, and I just got a chance to go wide with David's last 15, 20 years. But the bottom line is that he really missed this. He missed being part of a band, and I could see how you would if you had nothing else going on. Do you approach dramatic roles essentially the same as you do comedy?On Better Call Saul, someone else did all the writing for me. And they were really good at it. I would think that would be a little more limiting, because in the back of the brain, there's the joke gland and that can't help but be activated when you're improvising a comedy, and you're standing there with Fred Willard or Jennifer Coolidge, or these people that you know could destroy you, just because they're so funny and so remarkable. So it's just different when someone else is doing the talking for you. What stands out in your memory from working with Elton John and Paul McCartney?They were two different guys, obviously, and Elton's stuff with us really revolves around the playing. And Paul was a little bit more — the character of Paul McCartney was a little clearer. I was doing Glengarry Glen Ross on Broadway, and he came to see the show. And somebody says, “Oh, you know each other?” And he said, “Yeah, we're in a movie together.” He was just amazing. And he learned my dumb song that I wrote fortysomething years ago. You guys are apparently playing one more concert. Would you be OK with that being the end of Spinal Tap?Sure. If you only halfway exist, then vanishing altogether is not a big chore. We don't wanna ride it too long. I don't think this is the right age to be if you're gonna go out on the road and do a real tour. Christopher Guest told me he's retired from filmmaking. Does any part of you want to nudge him to do other stuff?I wouldn't nudge Chris. I think maybe his last experience [as the writer-director of the 2016 comedy Mascots] wasn't all positive. I think he'd reached the end of that. I always thought that he should have pulled what one of the Zucker brothers did, just go rogue and do something that's not a comedy. He's made his own decisions and they've all worked out really well. Retirement doesn't seem to be on your radar.I worked with Jerry Orbach when I did a Law & Order, and I said, “How is it possible that in the course of four years I saw you do six [Broadway] shows?” He said, “I love to work more than anything.” And I said, “So when actors talk about retiring…” he goes, “Fuck that. When I wrap my last day, just take me right to the cemetery unless there's a golf course on the way.” He had his priorities. Protest Singer Jesse Welles Laments the Death of Charlie Kirk in New Song 'Charlie' Bill Maher Decries Political Responses After Charlie Kirk's Death: ‘Let's Not Debate About Who's Worse' People Are Losing Their Jobs for Criticizing Slain ‘Free Speech' Advocate Charlie Kirk He's that guy, and my wife's the same way. I've done nine Broadway shows in the past 25 years. And I love working on film too, except you gotta get up earlier. It's just something I really love to do. I have to mention your courtroom breakdown scene in Better Call Saul — it's one of the greatest acting moments of the last few years.I knew this guy, even as he was discovering that he didn't know himself as well as he thought he did. I thought that was an interesting thing to play, the self-discovery that you're still trying to keep at arm's length. Usually, keeping it simple is the right thing. But this was a very complex character, and I had to keep all those plates in the air, and it just worked out. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week in Staff Picks, Staff Writer Emma Keates checks in with Big Thief post-“interpersonal issues,” and Editor-In-Chief Danette Chavez recommends a fizzy treat of a biopic. Big Thief could not have come up with a better name for their latest album than Double Infinity. That feeling is partly a function of Double Infinity‘s unusual recording process. Until 2024, the band had been an almost preternaturally close quartet—so much so, that founding bassist Max Oleartchik commented that they had almost “melted into each other” in a 2019 interview with the Los Angeles Times. That was before Oleartchik parted ways with the band last year for what both parties have attributed exclusively to “interpersonal issues,” leaving vocalist-guitarist Adrianne Lenker, guitarist Buck Meek, and drummer James Krivchenia to forge ahead as a trio. One might think that this downsizing would make the music feel smaller in turn, but Oleartchik's absence turned out to be incredibly generative for the band. The resulting album feels like community personified, captured on stereo. On Double Infinity, the band's previously tight instrumentations give way to a lush and, at times, almost otherworldly cacophony of sound and feeling. “I find you in a cafe/We proceed to only half-say,” she sings on “Words” before her voice is swallowed up by a chorus of others. It will make you want to splash in a river or run through a field at sunset or fall in love. Per (Valdemar Wahlbeck) is introduced as an introspective music nerd who breaks out of his shell after watching a single live-music performance. The music and lyrics flow quickly from there, and Per builds his band—Mats “MP” Persson (Ville Lövgren), Micke Syd Andersson (Phoenix Parnevik), Anders Herrlin (Lancelot Hedman Graaf), Göran Fritzon (Xawier Kulas)—with not much more difficulty. Unlike a lot of musician biopics, Sounds Of Summer mostly avoids heaviness, preferring to keep things as light as the songs performed by the band at its core. The Per Gessle of this film isn't so much a tortured genius as he is a somewhat lonely guy who understands better than most how music connects us. He forms a band to get the songs out of his head and into the world, and ends up making his first real friends. Gyllende Tider's success is never really in doubt, not even during a disappointing trip to Stockholm. Even now, it pops back up cyclically, like visitors returning to their favorite beach town. And Gyllende Tider reunites with similar regularity, still playing to huge crowds. Sounds Of Summer goes down like a lemonade that's on the sweeter side, but after all, it is still summer for another nine days.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jon Cryer had an extensive career before starring in CBS sitcom hit Two And A Half Men with Charlie Sheen, and he's had a pretty good career since then. But he's now once again picking up attention, not for his own life, but for the ways it's been pulled into Sheen's undeniable orbit over the years. That's courtesy of a new Netflix documentary about his old co-star, aka Charlie Sheen, which Cryer ended up sitting down for an interview for (after a number of stated reservations), and which saw him compare his old colleague to no less weird a figure than former North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il. Cryer specifically deployed this geopolitical nightmare metaphor while talking about Sheen's contract negotiations as Two And A Half Men (and his various crises) went on, which ultimately saw Sheen take home roughly three times what Cryer was making on the series. “He acted crazy all the time and thus got enormous amounts of aid from countries who were so scared of him that they would shovel money at him. [Sheen's] negotiations went off the charts because his life was falling apart. Me, whose life was pretty good at that time, I got a third of that.” (For what it's worth, this is not the first time Cryer has compared Sheen's tactics to North Korean appeasement strategy; in an interview with us last year, he compared Sheen to Kim Jong-un, instead.) Cryer points out that Sheen (who was “in the midst of falling apart in every way that I can imagine”) had CBS at least partially over a barrel because the show had been pre-renewed for multiple seasons before Sheen's struggles with addiction kicked back up. Cryer—who also wrote a lot about Sheen in his 2015 memoir—is apparently gun-shy enough about the whole thing these days that he really debated even sitting down for the aka Charlie Sheen interview. “If you wonder what it's like to work with Charlie Sheen for eight years,” he jokes in the just-released doc, “When I started, I had hair.

In the new comedy “Driver's Ed,” Sam Nivola (of “White Lotus” incest fame) plays a lovesick high school senior, Jeremy, who has a passion for movies. If you told me that “Driver's Ed” was itself made by Jeremy, I'd believe you; it has all the distracted, hurried texture of typical teenage creative output, batting at big emotions it doesn't quite understand and zigging haphazardly in various directions as it makes its way to the most obvious of conclusions. Were I his film teacher, I'd give Jeremy a solid B on the assignment but suggest maybe he consider majoring in accounting. So I'm not sure what their excuse is. “Driver's Ed” is almost shockingly generic, a boilerplate teen road-trip movie whose only distinct personality trait is having no personality at all. Were it not for the iPhones and a “lit” here and a “no cap” there, “Driver's Ed” could have been made in the early 2000s, those waning days of the last great teen cinema epoch. Its sensitivities are more evolved than those of, say, “American Pie,” but “Driver's Ed” would otherwise fit cozily alongside any of the movies that “American Pie” inspired. There are glimmers of originality in Moffett's script, flashes of idiosyncratic detail that suggest something richer, more personal that could have been had Farrelly not sanded down every edge he could. Farrelly takes broad swings at comedy, but few of his jokes land. The film concerns Jeremy's madcap adventure to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where his bitterly missed girlfriend, Samantha (Lilah Pate), is a freshman at UNC. Jeremy is pretty sure he's going to lose Samantha to the temptations of college life if he doesn't do something big. So he steals a driving instruction car and steals off into the Carolina backcountry, with three mismatched fellow students in tow. What ensues is meant to be a comically odyssean journey in pursuit of blind passion. In reality, a few minor things happen and then the movie ends exactly as we expect it to. He breathes something like real life into Moffett's bland characterization. He has able support from Aidan Laprete as an affable slacker, Mohana Krishnan as a Type A overachiever, and TikTok star Sophie Telegadis, doing very convincing Samaire Armstrong-on-“The O.C.” drag. The kids have a lively, winsome rapport and manage to register some specificity in the face of Farrelly and Moffett's myriad tired clichés. Molly Shannon does her noble best with a Bad Principal role, while Kumail Nanjiani strains for anything resembling humor as a loser substitute teacher. I'm sure both saw some value in working for one of the Farrelly brothers, even in 2025, but they maybe should have held out for something better. “Driver's Ed” is kindhearted and well-intentioned enough that one can't outright hate it. But Farrelly seriously tries that good will as the movie lurches along. “Driver's Ed” has all the arbitrary comedy of a bad improv set, seeming to figure that randomness itself is funny. There are a few laughs to be found in the film, little moments of wit or weirdness, but the film is otherwise a mirthless drag rescued only by its bright leads. “Driver's Ed” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An attorney for the pop superstar refutes Baldoni's claim that she consented to questioning in the It Ends With Us legal battle. UPDATE (Sept. 12): In an order Friday evening, Judge Lewis J. Liman denied Justin Baldoni's request to depose Taylor Swift after the current discovery deadline, stating that Baldoni's team “failed to demonstrate appropriate diligence” after only recently reaching out to Swift's camp about scheduling the deposition. This means Baldoni has lost his shot at deposing Swift, foreclosing what could have been an intense court battle over whether the pop star would be forced to sit for questioning. Baldoni's attorneys wrote in a request for a discovery schedule extension on Thursday (Sept. 11) that Swift “has agreed to appear for deposition” but cannot do so earlier than Oct. 20 because of “preexisting professional obligations” — presumably referring to the rollout of her highly anticipated twelfth album, The Life of a Showgirl, which arrives on Oct. 3. But Swift's longtime attorney Douglas Baldridge says in a Friday (Sept. 12) court filing that this is false. “My client did not agree to a deposition, but if she is forced into a deposition, we advised (after first hearing about the deposition just three days ago) that her schedule would accommodate the time required during the week of October 20 if the parties were able to work out their disputes,” wrote Baldridge. Baldoni has been saying for months that Swift's friendship with Lively makes her a key witness in the lawsuit, in which Lively alleges Baldoni sexually harassed her on the set of It Ends With Us and then orchestrated a retaliatory smear campaign after she complained. The current discovery schedule has all depositions concluding by the end of September, in anticipation of a March 2026 trial date. Swift's reps have previously slammed Baldoni for “creating tabloid clickbait” by dragging the star into the case despite her minimal involvement in It Ends With Us. Baldridge reiterated this position in his letter to the court on Friday, writing, “Since the inception of this matter we have consistently maintained that my client has no material role in this action.” Lively's lawyers have similarly lambasted Baldoni for involving Swift in the litigation, writing in their own Friday court response that the strategy is designed “to generate a media spectacle.” “The Wayfarer defendants' lack of diligence, and disrespect for Ms. Swift's privacy and schedule, is astounding,” wrote Lively's lawyer Michael Gottlieb. At any point over the past six months, the Wayfarer defendants could have noticed a deposition, served a subpoena and negotiated an agreeable time and place for this deposition. Judge Lewis J. Liman has not yet ruled on Baldoni's discovery extension request. The fiery legal battle between Lively and Baldoni has been in full force since last December, when the actress brought sexual harassment and retaliation claims against her It Ends With Us co-star and director. Baldoni vehemently denied the allegations and countersued Lively and her inner circle for defamation, though Judge Liman later dismissed Baldoni's counterclaims as legally invalid. Now, only Lively's original allegations are headed toward trial this coming spring. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>
