                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Muscular Dystrophy UK, a charity working on behalf of 110,000 children and adults living with more than 60 muscle-wasting conditions, has awarded £140,944 in funding to Dr. Rebecca Jones at Aston University for a project to understand the cause of a condition called inclusion body myopathy. The condition, also known as VCP multisystem proteinopathy type 1 (VCP MSP-1), is a rare and often overlooked condition that affects muscles, bones and nerve cells. The project is one of 13 new research projects being funded by Muscular Dystrophy UK in England and Northern Ireland, with a total investment of £2m. "Receiving this funding from Muscular Dystrophy UK means a great deal to me. I really hope that we can contribute to the growing body of research on inclusion body myopathy and ultimately make a difference to the people living with this life-changing condition." We're proud to be increasing our investment in research year after year - reaching new areas, exploring more conditions, and supporting a growing community of scientists. Our funding at Aston University reflects that ambition, supporting research into VCP MSP-1 for the first time. This project expands our reach into rare and often overlooked conditions, while also nurturing the next generation of researchers through support for Dr Rebecca Jones and her PhD student." Kate Adcock, director of research and innovation at Muscular Dystrophy UK Another project led by Professor Jordi Diaz-Manera, at Newcastle University, will also be exploring the condition further. Across more than 25 conditions, it's now supporting 51 active projects that aim to deepen understanding, explore new treatments, improve care and make a meaningful difference to the lives of those living with muscle wasting and weakening conditions. Muscle wasting and weakening conditions can affect anyone, no matter where they live. This will help to reach more people and communities. The charity has also awarded new funding to researchers in Belfast, London, Newcastle, Nottingham, Oxford and Portsmouth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For decades, amino acids have been added to medical formulations like insulin as stabilizers: these small molecules keep proteins (i.e. larger particles) from interacting in undesirable ways. And for decades, scientists have known that this works – but not why. Now, an international team of scientists, led by the Supramolecular Nano-Materials and Interfaces Laboratory in EPFL's School of Engineering, has finally explained the 'why' – and in the process, unearthed a fundamental stabilizing effect of all small molecules in solution. "When suspended in solution, proteins are constantly changing shape around a central form, and so the prevailing theory has been that amino acids help keep proteins from misfolding," explains recent EPFL PhD graduate and first author Ting Mao. "Now, we show that this is not the case. In fact, the stabilizing effect of amino acids has little to do with biology but is rather a general property of all small molecules in relation to larger particles, known as colloids, in solution." To understand this colloidal effect of small molecules, Supramolecular Nano-Materials and Interfaces Laboratory head Francesco Stellacci suggests imagining two colleagues walking toward each other on opposite sides of a hallway. If the hallway is empty, they will immediately spot each other and come together. But if the hallway suddenly becomes crowded, they may not see each other until they have already walked past, or even miss each other entirely. Interestingly, scientists have known for over a century that salts do the opposite: they screen repulsion. You can even see this in nature: it has been shown that when a plant is watered with salty water, its cells will produce more amino acids to help stabilize them as they become stressed by the increased salt concentration," says EPFL scientist and co-author Quy Ong. The researchers say that their work provides a strong argument for reporting amino acid concentrations in scientific studies going forward. "In biology, one would never do an experiment without reporting the ionic (salt) concentration of a solution. Our work shows that amino acid concentrations have just as much impact, and should therefore be reported just as rigorously," Stellacci says. With the support of our ERC grant, our goal is ultimately to predict which molecules can stabilize which proteins, and how much – something that is currently done by trial and error in biomedical research."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have identified the mechanism by which a common genetic mutation increases liver disease risk. Their findings suggest that healthy choices, such as increasing antioxidants and limiting exposure to smoke, may reduce the risk of this disease. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is an important enzyme that detoxifies harmful aldehydes produced in the body. While it is best known for metabolizing acetaldehyde –an aldehyde increased by drinking– it also plays a role in detoxifying other harmful aldehydes, including acrolein. Acrolein is a highly reactive aldehyde produced by environmental exposure to pollutants such as cigarette smoke. Some East Asians have a genetic mutation (ALDH2*2) that impairs the function of ALDH2. It is estimated that about 40% of Japanese people carry this mutation. The carriers of the mutation have an increased risk of esophageal cancer, especially among heavy drinkers and smokers. To understand how acute liver injury occurs in living organisms when aldehyde detoxification is impaired, a research group led by Associate Professor Takeshi Izawa and graduate student Yuki Takami of the Graduate School of Veterinary Science, Osaka Metropolitan University, used knock-in mice. They found that increased levels of acrolein coincided with the level of multiple aldehydes rapidly increasing in the blood, a phenomenon they named an 'aldehyde storm.' Their mechanism suggests the damage that can be caused in people after exposure to high levels of acrolein, especially in those with the ALDH2*2 gene variant. The exposure level of acrolein used in this study clearly exceeds that of smoking; therefore the risk of severe liver damage like that reported in this paper occurring by smoking only is low. Glutathione also suppresses oxidative stress and, accordingly, they found that the glutathione depletion promoted oxidative stress in the liver, leading to ferroptosis, a type of cell death. Their findings may also be relevant to people who carry the ALDH2*2 gene variant. These people typically have a reduced ability to break down aldehydes from alcohol, certain foods, and environmental chemicals. In these individuals, the liver's antioxidant defenses can be overwhelmed by sudden increases in aldehyde levels, leading to cell death and more severe liver injury. Their findings suggest that the aldehyde storm is a key part of this process. It also emphasizes the importance of people with this variant avoiding high aldehyde exposure, supporting their antioxidant system through a healthy diet, and monitoring their liver health. "Acrolein is also found in electronic cigarette smoke and as a metabolite of anticancer drugs. The results of this study suggest that ALDH2*2 carriers may be at health risk from daily exposure to aldehydes caused by smoking and in certain medications," Izawa said. "Going forward, we plan to investigate other health effects of chronic exposure to aldehydes in ALDH2*2 carriers, particularly their involvement in cancer."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>School closures during the COVID-19 pandemic imposed enormous long-term costs while other measures delivered better health outcomes for far less money, according to new research led by Oxford University's Department of Statistics and the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science analysing non-pharmaceutical interventions in the United States. The study, published in BMC Global and Public Health, examined policies implemented across US states during 2020, before vaccines became available. Researchers from Oxford and the University of Washington analysed eleven different non-pharmaceutical interventions, combining disease modelling with economic analysis to calculate both health benefits and costs to society. During this pre-vaccine period, policymakers relied entirely on non-pharmaceutical measures such as mask mandates, social distancing, testing, contact tracing, and facility closures to control the virus. School closures prevented roughly 77,200 COVID-19 deaths and reduced transmission rates by 8.2% but created £1.6 trillion ($2 trillion) in future economic losses through damaged education. In comparison, mask mandates cut transmission by 19%, making them more effective at preventing disease spread, while imposing minimal costs. Testing and contact tracing programmes also proved efficient compared to implementation costs. The pandemic posed unprecedented challenges to decision-makers at all levels. While our policy response was not optimal – and we could not have expected it to be – our study shows that many of the measures implemented mitigated economic damage in addition to suppressing transmission of the virus. 'Our study shows how using statistical methods to analyse all the sources of data could improve health outcomes and vastly reduce costs to society,' said co-author Adrian Raftery from the University of Washington. The findings provide a blueprint for future pandemic planning, offering concrete data on which interventions deliver the best health outcomes while minimising economic and social disruption. The research suggests rapid deployment of testing, contact tracing, mask mandates and social distancing, combined with targeted facility closures, could control similar future outbreaks without massive educational costs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Understanding the strategies and unmet needs of caregivers managing medications for people with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias may improve the lives of both caregivers and patients. A recent study, whose authors include Regenstrief Institute Research Scientists Noll Campbell, PharmD, M.S., and Malaz Boustani, M.D., MPH, describes the strategies and unmet needs of caregivers managing medications for people with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias. By employing a user-centered design (UCD) approach and using virtual contextual inquiry, the researchers identified three distinct caregiver personas: "Checklist Cheryl," "Social Sam," and "Responsive Rhonda." The study found that caregivers employ diverse strategies, blending technology-based with physical methods. It also determined that needs - such as better symptom tracking, clearer communication guidelines and support for self-care - are not fully addressed by current digital or non-digital interventions. These nuanced personas can guide the design of customized caregiver support and digital health tools. Each persona profile includes that caregiver's approaches to acquiring, organizing and administering medication, monitoring symptoms, communicating with care networks and seeking medication information. The research also offers recommendations for digital health interventions tailored to each persona's unique needs, such as apps with customizable reminders, symptom and side effect trackers, and platforms for social support. The methodology - virtual contextual inquiry - also serves as a practical approach for future research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Magic mushroom" edibles sold at smoke shops and convenience stores are likely to contain no psilocybin but instead a range of undisclosed active ingredients, a study led by an Oregon State University College of Pharmacy scientist shows. Neither was muscimol, a psychoactive compound found in Amanita mushrooms. Among the undisclosed ingredients found were caffeine and extracts of the botanicals hemp and kava, said OSU's Richard van Breemen, professor of pharmaceutical sciences and a researcher at the university's Linus Pauling Institute. Syndelics represent a rapidly growing area of drug design, where medicinal chemists create novel compounds inspired by known psychedelic agents like psilocybin and LSD. Although this approach offers therapeutic potential for the discovery of drugs that might be useful for treating a range of mental health conditions, any new drug entity requires years of development to evaluate human safety and efficacy, and premature exposure to these compounds poses significant public health risks due to unknown pharmacology and toxicity." Richard van Breemen, professor of pharmaceutical sciences and researcher, OSU In the United States, LSD is a schedule 1 controlled substance, meaning it has a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use. But psilocybin is under investigation for treating depression and substance use disorders and is legal for medical use in Oregon (in Colorado, it's legal for recreational use). "For safety, psilocybin products require both analytical standardization and production that follows current Good Manufacturing Practices," van Breemen said. "Advances in analytical chemistry are needed to detect new syndelics and other adulterants in consumer products, to expose misbranding, to support law enforcement and regulatory agencies, and to assist poison control centers and hospitals as they encounter overdoses caused by unknown compounds." Key to those advances, he added, are studies such as this one that foster collaboration among academia, public health and industry to develop and validate detection methods using state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation like biomedical mass spectrometry. Different types of labs have unique capabilities, and combining them is necessary for the best retrospective analyses and real-time public health surveillance. Van Breemen, whose lab at the Linus Pauling Institute specializes in dietary supplements and natural products, noted that during 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 180 emergency cases related to magic mushroom products.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Modern research is now elucidating the mechanisms behind these effects, focusing on ginseng's immunomodulatory properties, ability to improve quality of life, and potential role in cancer therapy. This review aims to consolidate recent findings on these aspects, highlighting both the promises and limitations of ginseng as a scientifically supported therapeutic agent. Ginseng's immunomodulatory properties are primarily attributed to its active compounds, ginsenosides and polysaccharides. Additionally, ginseng enhances natural killer (NK) cell activity via the TLR4/MyD88 pathway, increasing cytotoxicity by two- to threefold. Polysaccharides in ginseng, such as arabinogalactan, activate macrophage receptors and promote hematopoietic recovery, as evidenced by accelerated white blood cell regeneration in irradiated animal models. Ginseng significantly improves quality of life, particularly in individuals experiencing sub-health states-a condition characterized by chronic fatigue, cognitive decline, and emotional disturbances. A clinical study using Renshen Yuanqi (RSYQ) Drink, a ginseng extract, reported an 85% improvement in sub-health scores among young adults after 30 days. Key benefits included reduced fatigue, enhanced cognitive function, and improved mood. These effects align with ginseng's traditional use in alleviating chronic fatigue and supporting mental well-being, likely mediated by ginsenosides with antidepressant and neuroprotective properties. While direct cytotoxic effects of ginseng on tumor cells are not fully established, ginsenosides show promise in inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. For example, ginsenoside Rh2 suppresses the PI3K/AKT pathway in prostate cancer, reducing tumor proliferation and invasion. These mechanisms suggest ginseng's potential as an adjunct therapy in oncology, though clinical evidence remains preliminary. Despite its benefits, ginseng poses safety concerns, particularly at high doses or when combined with certain medications. Ginsenosides may also inhibit liver enzymes like CYP3A4, potentiating drug toxicity. Concurrent use with other herbs, such as aconite, can lead to severe reactions. Therefore, careful dosing and monitoring are essential for safe integration into clinical practice. Future research should focus on large-scale randomized controlled trials to validate these findings and explore ginseng's synergistic effects with conventional therapies. However, robust clinical evidence is still limited, and safety concerns necessitate cautious use. Future studies should prioritize high-quality trials to fully harness ginseng's potential in integrative medicine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CAR-T cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in treating hematologic malignancies and is now expanding into solid tumors. On June 1, 2025, The Lancet published positive results from the world's first randomized controlled trial of CLDN18.2 specific CAR-T in gastric cancer, led by Professor Lin Shen's team at Peking University. Recently, CAR-T has also shown great potential in treating autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis. However, CAR-T development has long faced a persistent challenge: each new CAR targeting a novel tumor antigen requires the iterative development of a fully validated detection reagent to confirm CAR surface expression. This process is not only costly and time-consuming but may also introduce data bias due to insufficient antibody specificity, significantly delaying project timelines. To address the challenge, Sino Biological has developed anti-whitlow 218 linker rabbit monoclonal antibodies, which specifically binds to the whitlow 218 linker sequence (GSTSGSGKPGSGEGSTKG). The antibodies are independent of antigen specificity, making it applicable across multiple CAR constructs and target antigens. A CAR (Chimeric Antigen Receptor) is a genetically engineered receptor that combines the antigen-binding ability of an antibody with T-cell activation capabilities. The CAR positive rate is a critical metric for evaluating CAR-T product potency, directly influencing target recognition and cytotoxic efficacy. Monitoring CAR expression in peripheral blood or tissues post-infusion provides insights into in vivo expansion and persistence, informing treatment response, durability, and potential relapse risk. Dynamic CAR expression monitoring also helps assess immunogenicity and safety. Currently, approved CAR-T products target CD19 or BCMA, making flow cytometry with recombinant BCMA or CD19 protein the standard detection method. Although highly specific, this approach is limited to single targets and is unsuitable for CAR-T screening and preclinical development. Several CAR detection methods have been developed, including Protein L (which binds immunoglobulins) or Fc-binding polyclonal antibodies. Polyclonal antibodies may cross-react with patient IgG, causing false positives. Anti-idiotype antibodies offer high specificity and sensitivity by targeting unique idiotopes in the CAR's antigen-binding region, but they are challenging to develop and produce. Anti-CAR linker monoclonal antibodies offer a universal strategy for CAR detection. Most CARs incorporate an scFv domain connected via flexible linkers such as Whitlow 218 or G4S. These standardized linker sequences provide a consistent and well-defined epitope. Regardless of the CAR's target antigen (e.g., CD19, BCMA, Claudin18.2, or CD22), anti-linker antibodies can detect CAR expression accurately, significantly improving universality and consistency compared to antigen-specific detection methods. The 218 linker, known for its good flexibility and stability, is used in nearly 90 % of scFv-based CAR constructs. First described by Whitlow et al. in 1993, its amino acid sequence (GSTSGSGKPGSGEGSTKG) promotes correct folding between VH and VL domains, enhancing scFv stability and function. Antibodies specifically targeting the linker region enable efficient and standardized CAR detection, offering five key advantages: Available conjugated to FITC or PE for flow cytometry. In-house developed rabbit monoclonal antibodies demonstrate minimal non-specific binding to PBMCs (<0.5 %). Sino Biological provides a diverse range of products and services for CAR detection, supporting CAR-based cell therapy development.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How did different countries fare in achieving a balance between infection control and economic stability during the COVID-19 pandemic? To address this question, researchers studied the temporal dynamics of number of deaths, vaccination rates, production, and economic recovery across multiple countries. The study highlights that countries differed in risk attitudes and economic preferences that shaped policy decisions, hence impacting their performance. These insights will benefit governments and citizens in forming social defense during future pandemics. While nations adopted different strategies, the central questions were the same everywhere: How should governments respond during this emerging infectious disease outbreak? Responses varied widely, with some countries prioritizing strict infection control and others moving quickly to protect economic activity. Each approach yielded different outcomes in terms of public health and socioeconomic stability, offering valuable insights for managing future crises. Their study, published online in the Journal of Policy Modeling on August 7, 2025, examined deaths, vaccination rates, production, and consumption across member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as well as Singapore and Taiwan, from early 2020 to the end of 2022. The findings reveal that infection control was rarely permanent. Eastern European countries and the United Kingdom faced the greatest challenges in containing deaths, while Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan were initially successful in keeping death rates low during 2020. However, by 2022, these countries too saw significant increases. With the exception of Norway, Finland, and Israel, all countries experienced declines in production, while consumption fell everywhere. The authors highlight that people's behavior and attitudes-such as patience, trust in government, and tolerance of risk-played a crucial role in shaping policy outcomes. Similarly, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan managed to limit deaths in the early stages while managing economic revival. In contrast, the US, which is considered less patient and less averse to risk, and Eastern Europe, with low trust levels, both experienced a higher number of deaths. Although these preferences may not be reliable and sufficient conditions for predicting fatalities, they have an impact. The United States, with relatively low patience and higher risk tolerance, managed a steady economic recovery despite higher deaths. In contrast, Japan's strong risk aversion and low confidence levels were linked to weaker economic revival. Reflecting on these findings, Prof. Masuhara notes, "To enhance public health and economic performance, it is necessary to take into account the different time preferences and attitudes toward risk that vary by country and its citizens. These insights should be recognized not only by governments but also by people themselves, and constitute an important component of social defense, including voluntary behavioral changes during future pandemics." Barring "luck," the knowledge of risk attitudes and levels of patience will help shape appropriate public health policies for future pandemics. As Prof. Masuhara concludes, "The success or failure of interventions depends on public patience and trust, and widespread cooperation with governmental interventions can contribute to building a robust social epidemic prevention system. We hope that our paper will serve as foundational material for future policy discussions." Discover how real-time Raman monitoring enhances API control and quality during hot melt extrusion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mentavi Health announced that its landmark, real-world validation study of the Mentavi Diagnostic Evaluation has been published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (JCP), a widely read and respected journal. The open-access article demonstrates that Mentavi's asynchronous, online evaluation is as accurate as a traditional face-to-face clinical interview in the diagnosis of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults and provides the first peer-reviewed evidence base for a fully digital diagnostic pathway for adult ADHD. "Publication in a top-tier peer-review journal moves this evidence base forward, for our diagnostic evaluation specifically and for telehealth in general," said Barry K. Herman, MD, MMM, Chief Medical Officer at Mentavi Health and first author of the paper. "The study shows that an online ADHD diagnosis can be accurately assessed asynchronously, closing gaps in care created by specialist shortages and long waitlists." Andrew J. Cutler, MD, Chief Medical Officer at the Neuroscience Education Institute, Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry at SUNY Upstate Medical University, and study co-author, commented: "As one of the first large peer-reviewed evaluations of a telehealth ADHD tool, this paper will shape guidelines and payer policies worldwide." Publication in JCP sets a new standard for evidence-based digital mental health. The prospective, real-world observational study compared the Mentavi Diagnostic Evaluation-a self-paced, asynchronous questionnaire interpreted by a doctorate-level psychologist-with a structured face-to-face clinical interview conducted via video. Primary endpoints were sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value relative to DSM-5 criteria. The protocol was IRB-approved and powered to detect ≥80 % sensitivity with 95 % confidence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study published in Nature Communications Medicine led by neurosurgery researchers Sima Mofakham, PhD, and Chuck Mikell, MD, of the Renaissance School of Medicine (RSOM) at Stony Brook University, provides clinicians with data about the path to consciousness after traumatic brain injury (TBI) that may help pave the way for more personalized and effective patient care strategies in critical care and rehabilitation settings. Every year, thousands of brain-injured patients are labeled as "unresponsive" in hospitals across the United States. Yet new research reveals that up to one quarter of these individuals may be conscious but just unable to show it. This disconnect, known as cognitive motor dissociation (CMD), represents one of the most urgent diagnostic blind spots in neurology and critical care. Mofakham and Mikell developed a first-of-its-kind artificial intelligence (AI) tool called SeeMe, which detects signs of covert consciousness by analyzing microscopic facial movements invisible to the naked eye. Their findings suggest that SeeMe can identify signs of awareness four-to-eight days earlier than traditional clinical exams. The work directly addresses the central dilemma outlined in a landmark 2024 study in The New England Journal of Medicine by Bodien et al., which found that 15 to 25 percent of patients diagnosed as unresponsive in the intensive care unit (ICU) may retain high-level brain function, but standard bedside tests are not sensitive enough to detect it. This misdiagnosis delays treatment and rehabilitation for patients who may otherwise recover. Our tool uncovers those hidden physical efforts by patients to show they are conscious." In a clinical study of 37 patients with acute brain injury and coma, SeeMe used high-resolution video and computer vision to measure involuntary facial reactions to verbal commands like "open your eyes" or "show me a smile." These subtle responses, typically undetectable by doctors or nurses, were recorded and analyzed using machine learning. In most of this patient cohort, SeeMe detected purposeful movement up to four days before the clinical care team recognized physical movements by the patients. With such an approach, we aim to turn complex data into tools that can help doctors make faster and better decisions for patients when every hour counts," Dr. Mofakham emphasizes. Additionally, the patients from the study with early SeeMe-detected responses were significantly more likely to regain consciousness and show better functional outcomes at discharge. "This is not just a new diagnostic tool, it's a potential prognostic marker," says Dr. Mikell, neurosurgeon, co-lead investigator, and Clinical Associate Professor and Vice Chair for the Department of Neurosurgery. "Families often ask us how long it will take for a loved one to wake up, or if they ever will. This study helps us answer those questions with more confidence, grounded in data, not just experience or instinct," explains Dr. Mikell, "We can use this information to personalize care, guide families, and optimize rehabilitation efforts." Misdiagnosis of unresponsive states can lead to inappropriate withdrawal of care, limited access to neurorehabilitation and missed windows for therapy. As SeeMe moves toward larger clinical trials and potential regulatory approval, the research team envisions integrating the tool into standard ICU practice, combining it with EEG and other data streams to create a multi-modal consciousness monitoring platform. They also believe that SeeMe stands as a powerful example of how AI can restore independence to patients by letting them speak without words. The work for both studies was funded by multiple institutional seed grants that support the ongoing collaboration between the Departments of Neurosurgery and Electrical and Computer Engineering at Stony Brook University.
