                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>News network Milenio releases public apology after US deputy secretary of state threatens to revoke Mexican visas A congressional staffer from Mexico's ruling party has resigned after being called out online for comments he made on a major Mexican television news program about Turning Point USA executive director Charlie Kirk's murder. The news network, Milenio, also released a public apology after the United States' deputy secretary of state – a former ambassador to Mexico – evidently threatened to have Donald Trump's presidential administration revoke any US visas on which it may count. The episode that unfolded at Milenio continued a trend of people losing their jobs over commentary about Kirk – a self-proclaimed free-speech advocate – deemed offensive by American conservatives, though in this instance it was outside the US. A Saturday morning tally by Reuters showed that at least 15 people had been fired or suspended. On Thursday, Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state and former US Mexican ambassador, warned on X that “foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country”. Ramírez appeared on a roundtable political analysis program with Milenio, discussing Kirk's killing. They gave a spoonful to someone who promoted the use of weapons. Ramírez added that Turning Point USA was “an anti-rights, anti-LGBT – practically anti-women – movement”. Minutes later, Landau went after Milenio itself, which is one of the most watched and read news outlets in Mexico. This is the level of ‘discourse' that you promote on your channel? I am embarrassed for having interacted with you during my tenure as United States ambassador to Mexico,” Landau wrote. Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Milenio released a public statement on Friday, apologizing for Ramirez's comments, saying the outlet does not “promote nor accept expressions of hate, violence or disqualification towards any person or group”. Ramirez then released a video on Friday afternoon apologizing for his “very unfortunate” comments, saying they were his own thoughts and not representative of the Morena party nor of Milenio. The FBI announced on Friday that Kirk's alleged killer had been arrested after a two-day manhunt.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dozens of social media posts and messages about the murder of Charlie Kirk, including some that celebrated his death, are being spotlighted by conservative activists, Republican elected officials and a doxxing website as part of an online campaign to punish the posters behind the messages. Prominent far-right influencer Laura Loomer, a US senator, and a site called “Expose Charlie's Murderers” have all drawn attention to people who have posted messages about Kirk's Wednesday assassination. The campaigns show how social media posts or personal messages — even by accounts with few followers or from people who are not public figures — could easily be surfaced and publicized, and people's personal information can be spread across the internet at a time when doxxing is easier than ever. The Charlie's Murderers site, whose domain was registered anonymously and which says it is not a doxxing site, claims it has “received nearly 30,000 submissions,” according to a message on the site's front page on midday Saturday. Currently, there are a few dozen submissions published on the site. “This website will soon be converted into a searchable database of all 30,000 submissions, filterable by general location and job industry. This is a permanent and continuously-updating archive of Radical activists calling for violence.” Most people whose messages have been posted on the site do not seem to refer to themselves as activists, nor did it seem many were calling for violence. The site also opened an X account on Friday. Loomer posted on X on Wednesday, hours after the fatal shooting, that “I will be spending my night making everyone I find online who celebrates his death Famous, so prepare to have your whole future professional aspirations ruined if you are sick enough to celebrate his death.” CNN was unable to reach Loomer for comment. And after MSNBC fired senior political analyst Matthew Dowd after he said Kirk's rhetoric might have contributed to his shooting, President Donald Trump himself weighed in. CNN has reached out to Dowd for comment. For example, Canadian independent journalist Rachel Gilmore posted that she is “terrified” about retaliation from Kirk's “far-right fans” after the shooting. That post is the first listed on the anonymous website, including a part where Gilmore said she hoped Kirk survives. She also said she received a “tsunami” of threats and called the last 48 hours of her life “a living hell.” Jones posted about Kirk on Wednesday, writing: “Save your sympathies for the innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire of MAGA's violent political messaging machine.” The website republished that post along with other pieces of Jones' personal information. “It is absolutely fair to call it a coordinated harassment campaign,” said Laura Edelson, assistant professor at Northeastern University and director of the Cybersecurity for Democracy Project. Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said a Middle Tennessee State University employee should be removed after writing they had “ZERO sympathy” for Kirk's death. The firing of this MTSU employee was the right decision, and it sends a clear message that this kind of reprehensible behavior must not be tolerated,” Blackburn said in a statement to CNN. And private companies, such as Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers and the Carolina Panthers, have also let employees go for their social media posts about Kirk. DC Comics canceled the just-released “Red Hood” comic book series after its author, Gretchen Felker-Martin, made comments about Kirk's death on social media. In since-deleted posts captured in screengrabs shared by other social media users, Felker-Martin allegedly wrote on social media after news of Kirk's death: “Hope the bullet's OK.” “At DC Comics, we place the highest value on our creators and community and affirm the right to peaceful, individual expression of personal viewpoints. Posts or public comments that can be viewed as promoting hostility or violence are inconsistent with DC's standards of conduct,” the company, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros. In most places, private companies can fire employees for any reason — and that includes crass social media posts, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a professor of labor and employment law at the University of North Carolina. It's a little trickier for public sector employees, but their firings are also justified if the speech is “so egregious it disrupts operations.” In a 1987 case, the Supreme Court decided that it was constitutionally protected speech, and not grounds for firing, for a government employee to tell her co-workers she was sorry that a would-be assassin failed to kill President Reagan. And it's extra sensitive for teachers, Hirsch said, since they work with young people, especially if the posts are applauding political violence. “The reality of the situation is, if they're getting flooded, even if it's from one political wing, with complaints, it's likely to push an employer to fire somebody,” he said. In other cases, some social media users highlighted Kirk's pro-Second Amendment stance, including past news reports that he said some gun deaths were “unfortunately” worth it to keep the Second Amendment. The highlighted social media entries span a range of responses to Kirk's shooting. One post, for example, simply noted the world continued on. It was registered through a privacy service with an address in Iceland. And the site's name already implies that the people whose information it shares are responsible for Kirk's murder, paving the way for harassment, Hank Teran, CEO at open-source threat intelligence platform Open Measures, told CNN. The website also echoes back to Kirk-founded conservative group Turning Point's “Professor Watchlist,” whose purpose was to unmask what it called “radical professors,” but often led to harassment and violent threats directed toward people named on that list. High political tensions across the country are ramping up people's emotional responses, said Edelson, the Northeastern professor, and it “creates a need to do something.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a connection to ‘trans ideology' was retracted, suspect's background and politics are being pored over Authorities revealed Kirk's suspected killer to be Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old man who grew up in Washington, Utah, along the state's south-western border. In absence of a clear motive for the slaying, reports have tried to piece together information about Robinson and his background. Now-deleted pictures on social media show Robinson and his family posing with guns. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Saturday, Utah's governor, Spencer Cox, said: “It's very clear to us and to investigators that this was a person who was deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology.” Cox cited the findings of the ongoing investigation into Robinson and his possible motive but did not provide any further details about how officials arrived at that conclusion. The FBI declined to comment about reporting on Saturday by conservative media outlets Fox News and the New York Post, citing law enforcement sources, that Robinson lived with a partner who was trans – a member of a community against whom Kirk rallied – and was cooperating with investigators. “Bad stuff happens, and for 33 hours, I was praying that if this had to happen here, it wouldn't be one of us,” Cox said. Sadly, that prayer was not answered the way I hoped for.” He went on to explain that it would have been “easier on us” if the suspect weren't from the community. After Robinson's identity was revealed, some conservatives have softened their attacks against Kirk's alleged murderer as an individual – but continue to leverage anger toward liberals as a group. Republican congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina tweeted on Wednesday that “it's time to bring back the death penalty” following Kirk's murder. On Friday, Mace said that Kirk “would want us to pray for such an evil and lost individual like Tyler Robinson to find Jesus Christ”. “We will try to do the same,” she wrote. Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning “There's one particular group that's been running around killing Americans in the name of ideology, and it's transgender activists or individuals, or those who proclaim that they are.” “This kid got radicalized, and obviously had a psychotic break … I am disturbed to see that he appears to have come from a loving, intact family,” Kelly said. Kelly noted that while authorities will be seeking the death penalty, it is ultimately a “mental health issue” that underpins the “radicalization” of young people who go to college. Meanwhile, white nationalist Nick Fuentes sought to shut down speculation that Robinson may have been a “Groyper”, a nickname for a follower of Fuentes, after reports on the engravings on the bullets of the alleged killer's gun led to theorizing on his ideology. Groypers had long criticized Kirk and trolled speakers at his events because the former perceived the latter to be too politically moderate. While Fuentes claimed in a social media post that he and his followers were “currently being framed for the murder of Charlie Kirk,” he also said in a streaming video: “I pray to God there is no further violence.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As an alderperson in northwestern Spain, Rosana Prieto tends to the running of her tiny village and is far removed from major cities, often rocked by protests over geopolitical issues. But with one of the world's biggest cycling races coursing through the bucolic hills nearby, she and hundreds of like-minded townspeople sensed a chance to make their small voices heard, denouncing Israel's military campaign in Gaza. Quebec bracing for protests with arrival of Israel-Premier Tech cycling team Israel's 23-month military grind into Palestinian territory, launched in response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, deadly attack on Israel, had already enraged many Spaniards, including its outspoken left-wing government. Israel has defended its military actions in Gaza and accused Spain of standing with Hamas. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez joined Ireland and Norway in recognizing a Palestinian state last year, and Spain became the first European country to ask a U.N. court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide. The Vuelta protesters argue that if Russian teams have been banned from international sporting events for the war in Ukraine, then Israeli teams should likewise be punished. “What we are seeing at the protests, in my opinion, is logical,” Alegría told Cadena Ser radio on Sept. 11. “Sports cannot be isolated from the world that surrounds them.” Opinion: Pro-Palestinian activists are applying a double standard at one of pro cycling's premier events For the Vuelta's security detail, it was logistically impossible to lock down the entire route through its twisting roads, much of which is lined by forest. Large groups have gathered in towns and protesters have jumped out of cover to block the path of riders, causing two athletes to crash, although it's unclear if that was the protesters' intention. But Israel Premier Tech has been endeavoring to keep a low profile. Riders have avoided speaking to the media and it took the step midrace of removing its team name from its riding uniforms. The team is owned by Israeli-Canadian businessman Sylvan Adams, who emigrated to Israel in 2016, and has played a key role in promoting Israel via sports. There have been occasional confrontations between police, security personnel, and protesters. Prieto said that she needed medical treatment for abrasions and knocks after a police officer dragged her across the ground. Joxean Fernández Matxin, the team boss of UAE Emirates, said that some of them hit riders with flag poles and tossed tacks in their path. “Everyone has a right to protest, but it's a shame that it has to happen here and in this way and that we can't finish the race,” race leader Jonas Vingegaard, a two-time Tour de France winner, said after Wednesday's stage finish was shortened. Yet cycling's biggest star was worried that the protests could spread to other races. “I think all the riders are a little scared of what could happen,” Pogačar told reporters in Quebec Thursday. Spain's prime minister chose this week to denounce Israel's operations in Gaza as “genocide” and make a nationally televised address announcing an arms embargo and blocking Israel-bound fuel deliveries from passing through Spanish ports. Israeli leaders called the Spanish government's actions “antisemitic” and a “blatant genocidal threat.” If the protests gain strength, they could become a concern for Israel, which has long prided itself on its close relations with the European Union. The European Commission's president, Ursula von der Leyen, this week called for partially suspending trade ties with Israel, and the Netherlands said it would boycott the popular Eurovision song contest next year if Israel is allowed to participate. For analyst Oriol Bartomeus, professor of political science at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, Sánchez's long campaign against Israel's incursion in Gaza is both benefiting from and fueling the grassroots protest movement at the cycling race. Sánchez is not stupid, and he has gotten right in there.” Protesters aim to take action again on Sunday, when the race concludes in Madrid.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A summit held Friday and Saturday on “human fraternity” convened Nobel prize winners to discuss everything from agriculture to the economy to sport, before culminating with an historic concert in St. Peter's Square directed by American singer-songwriter Pharrell Williams and celebrated Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli. Among those taking part in the AI discussions was Will.i.am, front man for the Black Eyed Peas, who has been involved with AI since 2012, after attending classes by the late Patrick Winston, a computer scientist from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The rapper and singer, who heads a technology company called FYI.AI and supports computer science education in Los Angeles, believes the church and Pope Leo XIV have a role to play in developing AI that serves humanity. He told CNN that the Vatican event offered a “safe haven” for brainstorming on AI. Teen gamer to become Catholic Church's first millennial saint For several years, the Vatican been pushing for a more ethical AI through meetings with leaders of tech companies, and Pope Francis called in 2023 for a “binding international treaty” to prevent harmful practices and encourage the best ones. The latest discussions, which took place in Rome's Palazzo Altieri, covered similar themes, with speakers including Geoffrey Hinton, known as “the Godfather of AI,” physicist and author Max Tegmark of MIT, Jimena Sofía Viveros Álvarez, a scholar and leading voice for ethical AI, and Marco Trombetti, founder and chief executive of Translated, which utilizes AI for translation services. Trombetti, who uses a mix of AI and human translators, told CNN that the development of AI risks creating a “digital divide” between countries which do and do not have access to the technology. He described the Vatican's role in discussions as significant because Pope Leo is a “magnet for talent” who has an “incredible power for spreading ideas.” On Saturday, a “human constitutional assembly” was presided over by Graça Machel, widow of South Africa's late President Nelson Mandela, and attended by several Nobel laureates. Ressa, who was awarded the Nobel for efforts to safeguard freedom of expression in the Philippines, told CNN that “if you don't talk about humanity at the Vatican, I don't know what else (you would talk about).” Back in 2013, Pope Francis made his first visit outside of Rome to Lampedusa. Speaking about Leo's election as the first American pope, Will.i.am said it was a “beautiful” thing given “all the things that are happening in America.” On Friday, an undocumented migrant in a suburb of Chicago was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer after resisting arrest. “I wish we treated Chicago and inner cities better going through tough times with a human, delicate approach,” Will.i.am said. “The fact that we have a pope from Chicago gives me hope.” While presenting his credentials, he  gave Leo a cake to mark the pope's 70th birthday this Sunday. According to the US Embassy to Holy See X account, during their meeting pope “underscored that our political differences can never be resolved with violence and told Ambassador Burch that he was praying for the widow of Mr. Kirk and his children.”</p>

With a growing number of countries around the world recognizing Palestinian statehood, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday declared that “there will be no Palestinian state” as he signed an agreement to develop a key settlement in the West Bank — prompting calls for the international community to hold Israel accountable for its illegal occupation and apartheid policies in Palestinian territories. At an event in the settlement of Maale Adumim, Netanyahu was joined by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Construction and Housing Minister Haim Katz as he signed an agreement with the town to develop 3,400 new housing units in the E1 settlement, which has long been stalled due to US opposition. “We are going to fulfill our promise that there will be no Palestinian state. As +972 magazine reported Friday, 7,000 Palestinians in the West Bank face forced displacement if the plan moves forward, and north-south travel could become “almost impossible,” as the proposed settlement would establish separate roads for Palestinians and Israelis and would divert Palestinian drivers from Route 1 onto a bypass. The town of Ezariyah, where many current residents travel frequently for shopping and other daily needs, “would become a geographically isolated island,” Mohammad Mattar, a member of the town's municipality, told +972. This will force many residents to leave and deal a devastating economic blow.” Mattar said that 112 demolition orders have already been issued for homes, shops, factories, and farmland. “Some businesses have already evacuated and cut their losses, while others are waiting,” he said. “It will force many residents to leave, particularly Jerusalemites who have built their lives and livelihoods around the town.” On Thursday, the Israeli anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now reported that it had prepared billboards denouncing the E1 plan to display in Maale Adumim during Netanyahu's event, but Mayor Guy Yifrah blocked them from being displayed. In addition to “burying” the possibility of a Palestinian state, as Smotrich said last month, “the annexation led by Smotrich and Netanyahu will bury Israel,” Peace Now said. Rudeineh noted that 149 United Nations member states have recognized Palestinian statehood, with the number jumping in recent months as countries including France and Ireland have announced their recognition, and called on other countries to do the same to increase pressure on Netanyahu to back off the E1 plan. “As more governments recognize a Palestinian state, it makes it harder for Netanyahu to proceed with his preferred options — mass expulsion (no Palestinians for a state) or endless apartheid (oppressive occupation with no state),” said Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch, last week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump isn't even trying to hide his authoritarianism within social acceptability. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. U.S. democracy has always been fragile, and we are now witnessing its dismantlement. The rising tide of political violence poses one threat to democracy in this country, but another quieter threat is also hard at work via the erosion of free speech and critical thinking, both of which are necessary for a flourishing democracy. These attacks are neither accidental nor incidental, but systematic and dangerously consequential to this country. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. Trump's regime is driven by a form of authoritarian control (both political and military), disinformation, and a blatant disrespect for the U.S. Constitution. He has ushered in policies rooted in forms of fascism, where the act of dominating the people is articulated and enforced as “common sense.” Hegemony, within the current U.S. context, captures what I see as an unmitigated criminal process of domination. In this exclusive interview, education scholar Stephen Brookfield offers clarity on the concept of hegemony, how it is linked to white supremacy and authoritarianism, and how critical education and educators can mount a necessary form of resistance. Brookfield is an adjunct professor at Columbia University Teachers College in New York and professor emeritus at the University of St. Thomas in Minneapolis-St. Paul. His goal is to help people (including himself) identify and challenge the dominant ideologies they have internalized. Brookfield is the author, co-author, or editor of 21 books, including Becoming a White Antiracist (with Mary Hess), Teaching Race, and The Handbook of Race and Adult Education (with Vanessa Sheared, Juanita Johnson-Bailey, Elizabeth Peterson & Scipio A. J. Colin III). The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length. Stephen Brookfield: Hegemony exists when a set of ideas that claim to explain how the world works, and the associated practices linked to these, sustain a particular social order. The question to be asked about hegemony is: Whose interests does it serve? Hegemony is always being contested as groups within a society constantly try to promote their own interests. When hegemony is most successfully in place, there is no need for paramilitary control because people have internalized the dominant ideology so completely that they police their own conduct. And, as Michel Foucault pointed out, they often take sensuous pleasure in doing so. A third is white supremacy, the belief that European settlers “tamed” and “civilized” a continent, and that their “superior intelligence” and capacity for clear decision-making helped create the greatest nation on Earth. Mixed into this combustible cocktail is authoritarianism, the belief that a strong leader is needed who brooks no dissent from their vision and policies, and whose certainty appeals strongly to those confused by the maelstrom of forces they see swirling around their individual lives. Erich Fromm's work outlined this dynamic beautifully three-quarters of a century ago. In earlier parts of my career, I had colleagues who disagreed with me on this point. Now I don't know anyone who disputes it. As the current administration hits its stride, we have revisionist history in place that erases any analysis of slavery. Add to this the targeted removal of any institutional practice or office that mentions the words diversity, equity, or inclusion (DEI); the ridicule of anything that describes itself as “anti-racist” as “woke”; and targeted lawsuits aimed at any university that resists these restrictions — and we have the clear attempt to install white supremacy as an official, state-approved ideology. Antonio Gramsci, whose work is usually associated with the term hegemony, was particularly focused on how cultural mechanisms enforce a certain picture of the world. The betrothal of the Trump administration to right-wing media is consummated by senior cabinet and advisory positions being filled by pundits drawn from these sources. The overt nature of this attempt to create hegemony is striking. There is no need to hide authoritarian control behind socially acceptable signifiers. While there was important pushback, I recall that a group of Texas educators had proposed to the Texas State Board of Education that slavery should be taught in second grade social studies as “involuntary relocation.” Or think about the Florida Board of Education and its approval to teach middle school students “that enslaved people gained a ‘personal benefit' from the skills they learned under slavery before the Civil War.” My sense is that partly undergirding this attempt to whitewash and rewrite the brutality of anti-Blackness within the U.S. is the aim to maintain a history and ideology of “white innocence.” Given your important work on whiteness, explain how the meta-narrative of white innocence is part of the core of what Trump is up to. George W. Bush said that the worst moment of his presidency was not 9/11 or leading the country into an invasion that killed hundreds of thousands in Iraq. Instead, it was being called a racist after his administration's lackluster response to Hurricane Katrina. This shows the deep-rooted belief held by many white people that we are essentially racially innocent. Sure, our ancestors may have enslaved people, but that was what was considered culturally appropriate at the time, and anyway it has no relation to who we are today. The strident rejection of white guilt is one aspect of this; as is the belief that referring to the history of slavery and settlement is a “woke” device that folks of color use to blame their situation on the past, thereby ignoring their need to take personal responsibility for their lives and work harder. A deeper sense of innocence is that which Shannon Sullivan describes as the innocence of “good white people.” This is the innocent belief in our essential humanity, in our commitment to “treating people as we find them,” in our subscription to the color-blind viewpoint, and in our belief that we act out of the best possible motivations. Under white innocence, the sincerity of our actions is what matters the most and “justifies” any unintended harm we might commit. In this worldview, the past does not matter, and structural barriers are overcome by exercising goodwill. Under white innocence, words and actions that came from a “good place” cannot be viewed as racist, owing to the purity of their intentions. In this way, innocence regards racism as an unfortunate problem of miscommunication owing to what we call “cultural differences.” As the current administration systematically defunds any institutional efforts to address racism, those who were made uncomfortable in the past by DEI programs can now breathe a sigh of relief. In their minds, we are back to “normal.” Balance has been restored after a period of whites being unfairly blamed for colluding in white supremacy. If you recall, in George Orwell's 1984, the dystopian Party can control what people think and do. In fact, in that book, the belief that “2 + 2 = 5” is taken as true and is indicative of the extent to which political power can be used to brainwash people. Fascism works to create a world where what is blatantly false has become what is deemed “common sense” and “true.” Under Trump's neo-fascist regime, we must fight against the perpetuation of systematic falsehoods and ideologies of distraction. You argue that the process of “doing ideology critique involves adults learning to become aware of how ideology lives within them as well as understanding how it buttresses the structures of the outside world that works against them.” Understanding and deploying the concept of ideology critique is indispensable at this moment. Explain ways in which teachers in schools and universities might use ideology critique to contest the attempt by the right wing to accept blatant falsehoods as “commonsense wisdom.” One of the greatest challenges in my teaching has been to work out how to get students to think structurally; that is, how they learn to realize that their individual actions are framed by their social location and that wider economic forces and dominant ideologies constrain the options they consider. I don't believe that individual choice is purely a comforting myth, and I do believe that individual consciousness is, ultimately, inexplicable. Chance, unpredictability, and serendipity are powerful elements of the human condition. But our choices are fueled by the ideological oxygen we breathe. When a government controls the flow of information and intimidates schools and media outlets into legitimizing their worldview, then hegemony becomes easier to establish. In adult education, a great deal of attention has been paid to what the transformative learning theorist Jack Mezirow called “disorienting dilemmas.” These are the moments when our settled expectations about how the world works are thrown into confusion. Examples would be facing an unexpected health crisis and finding care unavailable, being fired after a history of professionalism and assiduously working to achieve institutional goals, or being conscripted to fight in a war. “As the current administration systematically defunds any institutional efforts to address racism, those who were made uncomfortable in the past by DEI programs can now breathe a sigh of relief. In the classroom, teachers need to create disorienting dilemmas that unsettle and confound our students' expectations. Too much, and we risk them dismissing our activities as unrealistic. Too little, and we allow them to stay comfortable. In ideology critique, I present a cultural or institutional action that seems benign and desirable and then ask students to answer several questions about it: What assumptions are embedded in the practice? Why do those who benefit not recognize the harm it creates? How could the action be reimagined in ways that were fairer or socially just? As program changes are made, admissions criteria altered, and curricula revised, we need to pause very deliberately before deciding on a particular course of action and ask the ideology critique questions above. We also need teachers and institutional leaders to model the practice of critical reflection. And courses need to be taught by racially mixed teams who can model what a difficult racial conversation looks like — stilted, characterized both by periods of uncomfortable silence, and also displaying strong emotions and feelings. In my own capacity as a philosopher and a teacher, I have attempted to model what it means to engage in critical reflection. But what we are witnessing is the very opposite of critical reflection. In The Power of Critical Theory: Liberating Adult Learning and Teaching, you describe the problematic process of creating what you call “adult educators as professional ideologists.” What will education in the U.S. look like as “adult educators as professional ideologists” continue to gain traction? I have argued that critical reflection focuses on power and hegemony — on understanding how and when an elite group uses power in an authoritarian way to impose its cultural hegemony on the majority of people. It also reveals the tricks of ideological manipulation that result in people voting enthusiastically for politicians whose actions and decisions end up harming those same voters — and then continuing to do it over and over again. Adult education as political detoxification seeks to remove the addictive chemicals of white innocence from our consciousness. It demonstrates the falsity of believing that we all act on a level playing field, or the naivete of thinking that our actions are motivated solely by a humanist concern for everyone to get along.

MOSCOW, September 13. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the contributions of Muscovites to the successful conduct of the special military operation.

"Tens of thousands of Muscovites are fighting valiantly on the front lines. As has happened many times in history, Moscow has become a strong supporter of the Russian army. More than 500 Moscow enterprises are producing critical products for the front. Injured soldiers receive treatment and rehabilitation in the capital's hospitals. Hundreds of Moscow specialists, including doctors, special services employees, builders, and managers, provide daily assistance to residents of Donbass and Novorossiya," Putin said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In southern Utah, it's said there are more churches than traffic lights. “There's nothing to do out here except play golf,” said one taxi driver. College dropout Tyler Robinson, 22, was arrested on Thursday night and is expected to be charged with murder. Mr Robinson's confession brought to an end a two-day manhunt, after Kirk, an influential conservative activist and key Donald Trump ally, was shot dead on Wednesday, aged 31, while addressing a crowd of 3,000 students at Utah Valley University. The gunman fired a single lethal shot from 142 yards, before jumping off a roof overlooking the pop-up stage where Kirk was hosting one of his hugely popular “Prove Me Wrong” sessions, debating students on conservative issues. On the middle-class street where Mr Robinson grew up, 260 miles south of where Kirk was killed, the once-quiet neighbourhood was abuzz with camera crews. Reporters jostled for quotes from bewildered residents struggling to come to terms with how their peaceful suburb had become the focus of a nationwide manhunt. “For something of global impact on our nation to happen in your neighbourhood – it's wild,” said one man. The scene had become an attraction for a crop of local teenagers, excited to get a picture outside the murder suspect's house. A police car stood watch, warding off all who approached. Yet the $600,000 (£443,000) six-bedroom property itself was unremarkable, save for a back garden overrun with weeds and building equipment. The eldest of three brothers, Mr Robinson's social media shows him smiling with neatly combed hair and wearing a buttoned-up shirt: the picture of an all-American son. His mother, Amber, works in healthcare for the disabled, according to her Facebook profile. His father, Matt, was a longstanding member of the local sheriff's department. Another local, who lives across from the family, said he had spoken to Mr Robinson's father, Matthew, only “three times in the last 20 years” when collecting his mail. Clues may lie in his decision to drop out of college after one semester and instead enrol at Dixie Technical College as an electrical apprentice. A family member told the FBI that he had grown increasingly political “in recent years,” and, at a recent family dinner, had accused Kirk of “spreading hate”. Utah may be a ruby-red state, but politics is not a subject often brought up in the Latter-day Saints community, neighbours said. “We have our opinions, we keep our politics to ourselves,” Kristin Schwiermann, who has lived on the Robinsons' street for 16 years, told USA Today. Others worried that politics is becoming an insurmountable source of division in the US. Leeta Willoughby, 36, said: “Families have been torn apart by [it]. It was Mr Robinson's own father, encouraged by a church minister, who brought an end to the two-day manhunt by convincing his son to turn himself in. This looks like you,” he asked his son, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN. Robinson told his father that he would rather kill himself than turn himself in, but his father was able to persuade him to confide in a youth pastor who works with the Washington County Sheriff's Office. Melissa Tait, 55, whose children went to the same high school as Mr Robinson, said she was “so thankful” to the family for their actions. “That had to be an unbelievable decision and I hope all of us parents would do the same,” she said. Worse still, when allegations surfaced of their son's horrific crimes, the Robinsons were already grieving another tragedy. Easton Robinson, the suspect's cousin, died just weeks ago in a freak motorcycle accident, according to locals. Debbie Robinson, their grandmother, was not home on Friday, but a neighbour said she was having “a hard time with the loss of that grandson”. “She's probably very emotional right now,” the neighbour added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Teck Resources' Highland Valley Copper Mine near Logan Lake, B.C., on Thursday. Vancouver-based Teck has reached a friendly deal to be acquired by London-based Anglo.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press Ernest Oppenheimer, who founded the Anglo American mining empire in 1917, became so fabulously wealthy that he would sometimes casually slip a diamond into the palms of the wives of his business friends after dinner parties at his lavish Brenthurst estate in Johannesburg. The son of a German cigar merchant, he built a sprawling network of companies in South Africa's gold reefs and diamond fields. Today the iconic Anglo American brand is on the verge of disappearing forever, merging with Teck Resources Ltd. to become a new US$50-billion entity, Anglo Teck. The new company will be headquartered in Vancouver, with most of its top executives moving to Canada. Teck agrees to be acquired by Anglo American at crucial time for Canada's minerals industry South Africa's political and business elites seem resigned to the latest move. The government issued no statements about it this week. Anglo had already moved its headquarters to London in 1999, spinning off its gold mines into a separate company and maintaining only a secondary listing in Johannesburg. After recently spinning off its South African platinum assets, Anglo is now seeking even to divest from De Beers itself if it can find a buyer. Teck Resources' Highland Valley Copper Mine near Logan Lake, B.C. The new company will be headquartered in Vancouver, with most of its top executives moving to Canada.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press South Africa's state-owned Public Investment Corp., one of the biggest single shareholders in Anglo with a reported 8-per-cent stake, was actively opposed to an attempt by BHP to purchase the company last year. South African Mining Minister Gwede Mantashe strongly criticized the BHP takeover bid. “But it is another loss for mining in SA.” Anglo CEO Duncan Wanblad has tried to reassure South Africans by insisting that the company has “an enduring commitment” to the country and its “national priorities,” despite the planned relocation of its headquarters to British Columbia. He pledged that the new company would include South Africans on its board and executive team, and he promised financial contributions to the country's junior mining exploration fund. He also declared that Kumba Iron Ore will remain “core and pivotal” to the merged company. A century ago, foreign investors were much more intrigued by South Africa's mining prospects. Ernest Oppenheimer collected capital from British and U.S. financiers, including Herbert Hoover and J.P. Morgan, to help him create Anglo American, its name reflecting the nationalities of its main funders. (He briefly contemplated calling it “African-American Corp.” until the idea was sharply rejected by his U.S. Ernest and Harry Oppenheimer were often listed among the world's wealthiest people. In 1961, Anglo acquired a major Canadian company, Hudson Bay Mining, and then continued to expand internationally. Harry Oppenheimer was more progressive than some of his rival tycoons in South Africa. He criticized apartheid and supported the creation of trade unions at Anglo's mines. But he also benefited from apartheid, which entrenched an exploitative system of cheap labour from migrant Black mineworkers, making his mines more profitable. After moving its headquarters to London in 1999, Anglo failed to keep pace with the world's top mining conglomerates, reflecting the decline of South Africa's mining sector. And if the latest merger is approved, Anglo Teck's CEO will be Mr. Wanblad – another South African. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The special services of several countries are financing protests in Serbia, spending $4 billion on this, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said. "Four billion dollars have been spent on destroying the state. The main organizer of the color revolutions comes from outside. These are employees of various special services, and they are doing this from several countries," Vucic said in an interview with TV Informer. He explained that he had to remain silent before because doing so would have violated Serbia's neutrality toward the possible instigators of the protests. However, he noted that "these countries know that we are aware of what they are doing." Previously, Vucic reported that 9,380 people participated in protests across the country on September 5, with more than 7,000 gathering in Novi Sad. According to the Serbian president, the most serious incidents took place there: a group of people in balaclavas tried to occupy the philosophy faculty of the local university, but the police prevented this attempt. Commenting on the events, Serbian Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabic said that European officials not only support unauthorized protests but also participate in them personally. She particularly noted the presence in Novi Sad of European Parliament lawmaker Rasmus Nordqvist from Denmark and Vula Tsetsi, co-chair of the European Green Party from Greece, calling their statements about the rule of law hypocritical while supporting anarchic actions in Serbia.</p>

LONDON (Reuters) — Degraded land, polluted air and water stress pose a direct global economic threat, but using natural resources more efficiently could cut pollution by half, one of the World Bank's senior managing directors told Reuters. The damage is particularly acute for low-income countries most at threat from poverty, climate change and biodiversity loss, Axel van Trotsenburg said. Speaking alongside the publication of a new report on Sept. 1, he said around 80% of people in low-income nations were exposed to all three and the World Bank was committed to responding even as many countries cut aid budgets. “Our commitment … is ending poverty on a liveable planet, full stop. We will not waver on this,” van Trotsenburg said. Among the most impacted countries are Burundi, where 8 million people face water risk and air pollution, and 7 million face land degradation. In Malawi, 12 million people face all three risks, the report said. The report is published against a fractious political backdrop ahead of November's COP30 climate talks in Brazil. The World Bank and other multilateral lenders are also awaiting the outcome of a U.S. review of their operations ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump in February. The World Bank would provide data-backed evidence to inform discussions on environmental degradation among its member governments, van Trotsenburg said. It also means landscapes are less able to store and release moisture slowly over time. While ecological threats were often seen as being distant, the report zeroed in on economic impacts happening now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lithuania is prepared to immediately shut its border with Belarus in the event of a provocation, Lithuanian Interior Minister Vladislav Kondratovic said on Sept. 12. The minister's statement comes two days after Russia violated Polish airspace with 19 drones overnight on Sept. 10, forcing Poland to shoot down the UAVs. Following the drone breach, Lithuanian officials joined Poland in condemning Russia for the incursion and Kremlin ally Belarus for allowing Russia to use its airspace. Lithuania is keeping the border open at present out of concern for EU citizens still in Belarus, Kondratovic said. Poland temporarily closed all of its border crossings with Belarus on Sept. 12 due to the start of the Zapad-2025 military drills, joint exercises between Minsk and Moscow. Previously, Poland already closed most border crossings with Belarus, leaving only two in operation. Abbey Fenbert is a senior news editor at the Kyiv Independent.

The new guidelines, which are still being ironed out, will include general recommendations such as harsher criteria for Russians coming to the EU. Russia launched a tirade of attacks killing three people in Kostiantynivka, Donetsk Oblast, and killing one in Borova, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian authorities reported on Sept. 13. “NATO's commitment to win has been far less than 100%, and the purchase of Russian oil, by some, has been shocking,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social.

It is the third time Russian forces have used pipelines as a tactic, which they first adopted during the Battle of Avdiivka. The top European diplomat described Russia's three-step negotiation tactic: demanding what it never had, followed by ultimatums and threats, finished off by the West ready to concede to Moscow's demands. The latest reported death toll includes 36,568 volunteers, 18,261 recruited prisoners, 14,797 mobilized troops, and 2,777 mercenaries. "As of today, we can state that the Russian offensive operation on Sumy has been completely thwarted by our forces," President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 12, citing front-line reports from Commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi.</p>

Florida's Department of Education announced on Sept. 11 that it will look into public school teachers who, on social media, celebrated or justified the assassination of Turning Point USA CEO and founder Charlie Kirk.

Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas sent a letter to school district superintendents telling them that he would be investigating after it was brought to his attention that some educators had posted “despicable comments on social media regarding the horrific assassination of Charlie Kirk.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's offensive in Sumy Oblast has been "completely thwarted" by Ukrainian forces, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Sept. 12 following a briefing with Ukraine's top military command. "As of today, we can state that the Russian offensive operation on Sumy has been completely thwarted by our forces," Zelensky said in his nightly address, citing front-line reports from Commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi. In late June, Syrskyi reported that Russia's advance in Sumy Oblast had faltered, with Ukraine stabilizing the line of contact and beginning to liberate territory. Putin's order came as Russia once again rejected a U.S. and European proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine. Sumy Oblast has been a key target for Russian forces throughout the full-scale invasion due to its location on the northeastern frontier. It continues to face near-daily strikes, but Ukrainian forces have maintained control over most of the region. Earlier this week, Syrsky reported that Ukrainian troops had prevented Russian forces from launching a planned major offensive in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.
