Fox News' CB Cotton provides details on the next steps in the case against Tyler Robinson, who is accused of killing conservative activist and Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk. EXCLUSIVE: Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin lived with his transgender partner, senior-level FBI officials told Fox News Digital. Bureau officials confirmed that Tyler Robinson, 22, was in a "romantic relationship" with the unnamed person, who is a male transitioning to a female, and that they shared an apartment in Saint George, Utah. Those FBI officials told Fox News Digital that Robinson's partner is fully cooperating with the FBI's investigation. One FBI official told Fox News Digital the individual has been "extremely cooperative," and said the person "had no idea" Robinson was allegedly planning to assassinate the Turning Point USA founder. Forensic agents are seen at the apartment complex where Tyler Robinson, 22, the suspect in the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, lives in St. George, Utah, on Sept. 12, 2025. His widow pledged on Sept. 12 to continue his work after U.S. authorities announced the suspect's capture.. (Photo by Romain Fonsegrives/AFP) FBI officials told Fox News Digital that the FBI had text messages and other communications between Robinson and his partner that helped FBI agents zero in on Robinson. Officials said the FBI took evidence from their apartment, including computers, which has been sent to Quantico for review, Fox News Digital has learned. The FBI declined to comment on whether Robinson's partner would be charged with a crime. "Every connection, every group, every link will be investigated and anyone involved in this matter, anywhere in the world they might be, will be brought to justice." The apartment Robinson and his partner shared is in the same southern Utah community Robinson's parents live in. It is approximately four hours away from Utah Valley University, where Robinson allegedly shot Kirk. Kirk was killed Wednesday as he spoke to a crowd at the school's campus in Orem. Authorities believe a single shot was fired from the roof of a building some 200 yards away. Kirk was 31, and the married father of two young children. Robinson lived in this Saint George, Utah, apartment complex with his roommate and lover. Moments before Robinson allegedly shot Kirk, an audience member asked Kirk: "Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?" Kirk was then asked: "Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?" A law enforcement source told Fox News Digital that Robinson's father, who ultimately turned him in to authorities, told the FBI that he recognized his son from surveillance video images which FBI Director Kash Patel directed to be made public as the 33-hour manhunt unfolded. The source told Fox News Digital that when Robinson arrived at his father's home, he said he wanted to kill himself. Meanwhile, the rifle that the FBI believes was used to kill Kirk contained ammunition inscribed with anti-fascist messaging. Spencer Cox confirmed the messaging at a news conference Friday, saying investigators discovered inscriptions on casings found with a bolt-action rifle near the campus. One used casing and three unused casings contained the writings, Cox said. News of the ammunition inscriptions was first shared on social media Thursday morning in a preliminary bulletin attributed to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Three American veterans all working to get food to Palestinians in Gaza tell Fox News Digital about what it's like volunteering on the ground. Jason Murray, Scott Weimer and Brandon Zielinski — all U.S. military veterans — are working to ensure Palestinians in Gaza get the food they need. All three men spoke with Fox News Digital and said that they are proud of the work they're doing on the ground with GHF. "We kind of built a plane in flight … not even knowing where we were going to land," Murray said of the situation. GHF began its operations in May 2025, more than a year and a half after the war began. While facing challenges distributing aid in Gaza, Murray said he has seen parallels to his military service, which has helped him as a GHF volunteer. Weimer told Fox News Digital that when the opportunity presented itself, it seemed like a "natural fit" and that he felt he could fill a need in a way that others couldn't. He also said that his service experience, along with Murray's, worked in this type of environment where they were able to find people with the right skills and put them where they'd be most useful. When he was in the military, Zielinski said he experienced a lot of bilateral training in which he did not always speak the same language as his counterparts. He said his experience working through language barriers has helped in his interactions with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which coordinates with GHF. All three men spoke of the desperation they saw from hungry Palestinians trying to get food. They also described bad actors taking advantage of the situation – including Hamas operatives and gang members trying to harm people working with GHF, especially Palestinian locals. Murray gave Fox News Digital some insight as to how the IDF and GHF coordinate when it comes to keeping bad actors out and letting civilians in need get to the aid. We have been told through various means that, ‘Hey, Hamas was here today,'" Murray told Fox News Digital. A Palestinian woman carries a box as people seek aid supplies from the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), in the central Gaza Strip, Aug. 4, 2025. Weimer echoed Murray's sentiment, saying that the GHF personnel "absolutely see Hamas in the background," but their focus in the foreground is working to get aid to those in need. He also gave Zielinski's team credit for warding off the bad actors who try to interfere with GHF's mission. "They are amazing because the amount of people that are seeking food and seeking aid can be overwhelming at times. I have never once seen any of us overreact to what would be, I think, to anybody, a very scary situation," Weimer said of Zielinski and his team. Before Zielinski's team gets to work, they're usually given an IDF briefing on the security situation regarding the 48 hours or so prior to their shift. Zielinski told Fox News Digital that he has seen changes to the secure distribution sites (SDS) over time due to the threats that exist in the area. There's grenades that went off," Zielinski told Fox News Digital. He also said that his team looks for patterns, records them and then turns into intelligence officials information or materials that can be used to catch bad actors. "We'll see down the line that, okay, ‘Hey, we've seen this person before, he looked very suspicious,' and next thing you know, this is a guy that has a pistol on him," Zielinski said. Security contractors of the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) stand guard as Palestinians receive aid supplies from GHF, in the central Gaza Strip, Aug. 1, 2025. Weimer told Fox News Digital that the media depictions of GHF upset him because they're "so far askew." "I guess that's what I would tell the American people is, you know, these people that are here, these military veterans that lived a long honorable life, we would never be a part of something [like] what I've seen in the media," Weimer said. Gazans walk with boxes of humanitarian aid they received at a distribution center run by the U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). He said that the people he works with in the war-torn enclave strive to do whatever possible to help civilians in need. Since it began operating in May, GHF says it has delivered more than 160 million meals to Palestinians in need. "Everybody wants to help, and everybody sees the reward for doing so… We all just enjoy doing it," Zielinski said. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Erika Kirk, the widow of Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk, has lived much of her adult life in the public eye – first as Miss Arizona USA, later as a ministry leader and entrepreneur, and most recently as a wife and mother who shared her husband's outspoken Christian faith. Their love story, rooted in prayer and purpose, shaped not only their marriage but the movement he built, a legacy she now carries forward after his death. Hours before her life changed forever, Erika Kirk, posted a Bible verse, Psalm 46:1, which says: "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble." A baptized Catholic who attended Notre Dame Preparatory High School in Scottsdale, Arizona, Erika Kirk currently hosts a podcast called "Midweek Rise Up." It's described on her website as a devotional series released every Wednesday, along with Monday Meditations, "to provide you that deep breath of, ‘God's got this.'" Erika posted a selfie of her and Charlie on Sept. 5, 2023, marking five years since the two met. She wrote, "5 years ago today, we sat inside Bill's Burgers in NYC deep in conversation and banter over theology, philosophy, and politics and at the end, you paused, looked at me and said, ‘I'm going to date you.'" She captioned photos of the engagement on Instagram, "When God writes your love story, you get to marry your best friend." The two married less than a year later in May 2021. In a post with their wedding photos, Erika wrote, "To the man I've been praying for, before I ever met you. [T]o the man that I honor, respect, and deeply cherish. [T]o the man that leads in ways that remind me of the leaders before our time and [whose] confidence in God's word reminds me of Daniel... [T]o the man that I am immeasurably blessed to be able to call my husband. Charlie Kirk and his wife, Erika, appear on stage during the Turning Point USA Inaugural-Eve Ball at the Salamander Hotel in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 19, 2025. The role God played in their love story was a theme throughout Erika's posts about her husband. In February, Erika posted a video to Instagram featuring herself, Charlie and their children that was captioned: "thank you for being my love story." Charlie commented on the video: "my favorite." On Thursday, Charlie Kirk's casket was flown aboard Air Force Two along with Erika, Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance. Erika Kirk also waived to supporters from the motorcade with a cross in hand. Both the vice president and President Donald Trump were open about their relationships with Charlie Kirk and mourned him publicly, with the president ordering flags at half-staff across the nation. Erika Kirk weeps over her late husband Charlie's casket. Another image of Erika that went viral was her leaning over Charlie's open casket, seemingly hugging her late husband. The photo was included with the first post she made after his death and included a video of her holding and kissing her late husband's lifeless hands. Erika was no stranger to the limelight when she met Charlie. In 2012, she was crowned Miss Arizona USA. In addition to her pageant title, Erika was an NCAA basketball player at Regis University in Denver, Colorado, and graduated from Arizona State University after double majoring in Political Science and International Relations. She also earned a Juris Master's in American Legal Studies at Liberty University. In 2016, she started BIBLEin365, challenging others to commit to reading the Bible over the course of a year. The challenge later became a ministry program, which "seeks to help individuals engage with the scriptures daily," according to her website. Two years later, she launched Proclaim Streetwear, a faith-based clothing company that joined forces with BIBLEin356 in September 2021. With supporters gathered along the route, Erika Kirk waves as a motorcade brings the body of her husband, Charlie Kirk, to Hansen Mortuary Chapel in Phoenix on Sept. 11, 2025. (Diannie Chavez/The Republic / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images) Despite her accomplishments in the worlds of faith, fashion and pageants, Erika emphasized that her priorities in life included being a wife and mother. "Above all, Erika cherishes her role as the wife of Charlie Kirk and the mother of their precious son and daughter," her biography on her website reads. "As she continues to grow in her ministry, leadership, and entrepreneurial endeavors, Erika remains committed to inspiring others to live with purpose, rooted in faith and driven by the love of Christ in every aspect of life." Erika Kirk spoke for the first time since the assassination of her husband, Charlie Kirk, at Turning Point USA on Sept. 12, 2025. On Friday, Erika broke her silence and gave a moving statement on camera while standing next to the empty chair in which Charlie recorded his podcast. "Two days ago, my husband, Charlie, went to see the face of his savior and his God," she said through tears. "And one of the final conversations that he had on this earth, my husband witnessed for his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Now and for all eternity he will stand at his Savior's side wearing the glorious crown of a martyr." She added that Charlie's favorite Bible verse was Ephesians 5:25, which says: "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her." In her message to America, Erika made it clear that the movement her husband started would not die with him. She announced that Turning Point USA would continue its campus tour and would hold its America Fest, which is scheduled to take place in Phoenix, Ariz., in December. Charlie Kirk, who was killed during an event at Utah Valley university on Wednesday, is survived by his wife and their two young children, whose names have not been made public.

Anna Scott Marsh, friend of Charlie Kirk, joins Fox News Live to speak on his legacy and impact he had on the American youth. Tens of thousands of people took part in a "Unite the Kingdom" rally in London, England, on Saturday, where demonstrators also honored Charlie Kirk with some holding pictures and banners of the late conservative activist. Elon Musk also appeared via video link and condemned the left as "the party of murder" following Kirk's death. Supporters display a large photo of slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk as thousands marched in London at the "Unite the Kingdom" rally organized by Tommy Robinson. Robinson billed the march as a demonstration for free speech, saying it was also held in defense of British heritage and culture. "A man who inspired a generation of young men based on courage and based on faith," Robinson told the cheering crowd, which also sang Kirk's name. One demonstrator carried a sign reading, "Freedom of speech is dead. RIP Charlie Kirk," according to The Associated Press. Aerial shots showed streams of demonstrators carrying the St. George's red-and-white flag of England and the Union Jack. Many chanted, "We want our country back." Musk condemned the killing of Kirk, who was fatally shot on Wednesday at the University of Utah. Tyler Robinson, 22, has been arrested for the crime. People march with a banner honoring Charlie Kirk during the London rally, which organizers billed as a demonstration for free speech and British culture. "You see how much violence there is on the left, with our friend Charlie Kirk getting murdered in cold blood this week, and people on the left celebrating it openly," Musk said. Robinson praised Musk for purchasing Twitter and lifting bans on right-wing commentators, saying Saturday's event would not have been possible without him. He added that the British public was "telling the world they're ready to fight back," linking that directly to Musk giving them a platform. Musk warned of the dangers of stifling free speech and said the U.K. was at a critical point in its history. A poster with Charlie Kirk's image and the words "We stand together" is seen on a barricade as demonstrators rallied in London (Christopher Furlong/Getty Images) He added that the U.K. was in danger of losing its identity due to mass migration, accusing the BBC of being "complicit in the destruction of Britain." He also claimed mass migration was being used to import new voters. "I see a rapidly increasing erosion of Britain with massive, uncontrolled migration and a government that has failed in its duty to protect its citizens." "Britain is at a fork in the road — to darkness or greatness — and that will be decided only in a matter of years." Fox News' Greg Norman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The late Charlie Kirk's alleged shooter Tyler Robinson lived with a transgender-identifying partner, a source familiar confirmed to the Washington Examiner.

Robinson's roommate is a biological male who identifies as a female, and is cooperating with the FBI on their investigation. The bureau had texts between the shooter and the person that helped them confirm that Robinson is the shooter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aerial footage showed demonstrators taking to the streets of central London for a march organized by far-right activist Robinson. Counter-protests organised by groups including ‘Stand Up To Racism' were also staged in the capital, drawing significant crowds. Police officers form a line in front of demonstrators from the Tommy Robinson-led Unite the Kingdom march and rally near Westminster, London, Saturday Sept. 13, 2025. LONDON (AP) — A massive London march organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson became unruly Saturday as a small group of his supporters clashed with police who were separating them from counterprotesters. Reinforcements with helmets and riot shields were deployed to support the 1,000-plus officers on duty. “We continue to see significant aggression directed at officers by ‘Unite the Kingdom' protesters,” police posted on the X platform. At least nine people were arrested, but police indicated many other offenders had been identified and would be held accountable. Police estimated that Robinson drew about 110,000 people, while the rival “March Against Fascism” protest organized by Stand Up To Racism had about 5,000 marchers. Counterprotesters heckled a man with blood pouring down his face who was being escorted by police from the group of Robinson supporters. It wasn't immediately clear what happened to him. The larger crowd stretched from Big Ben across the River Thames and around the corner beyond Waterloo train station, a distance of about three-quarters of a mile (around a kilometer). The marches come at a time when the U.K. has been riven by debate over migrants crossing the English Channel in overcrowded inflatable boats to arrive on shore without authorization. Numerous anti-migrant protests were held this summer outside hotels housing asylum-seekers following the arrest of an Ethiopian man who was later convicted of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in a London suburb. Some of those protests became violent and led to arrests. Some Robinson supporters held signs saying “stop the boats,” “send them home,” and “enough is enough, save our children.” Robinson supporters chanted crude refrains about U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and also shouted messages of support for slain U.S. conservative activist Charlie Kirk. One demonstrator held a sign saying: “Freedom of speech is dead. Robinson had planned a “Unite the Kingdom” rally last October, but couldn't attend after being jailed for contempt of court for violating a 2021 High Court order barring him from repeating libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee who successfully sued him. He previously served jail time for assault and mortgage fraud. Robinson founded the nationalist and anti-Islamist English Defence League and is one of the most influential far-right figures in Britain. He urged followers not to wear masks, drink booze or get violent.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been happening for decades, and in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, Washington, D.C., has finally shown that it has no appetite for unity, only fight. President Donald Trump, himself an assassination target — twice — said “radicals” on both sides need to calm down. Liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) responded, “Oh, please,” as she blamed Trump for poisoning the political environment. Trump had a chance to deliver a unifying message, as predecessors Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton would have, but it's not his thing. And even if he had, as he did after his own near-death experience in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, it likely wouldn't have lasted. But perhaps it will be a turning point toward traditional values and civilized restraint,” Gurdon wrote. Charlie Kirk's death is America's turning point | @hgurdon https://t.co/TqRGRLd1NQ For our weekly White House Report Card, Democratic pollster John Zogby called out all of Washington's leaders. This week was defined by a human tragedy: the murder of a father, husband, son, and activist, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. Our hearts go out to his family, but this should not have become a springboard for hysteria, partisanship, and meltdown. The president and Congress have behaved shamefully. In other regards, it was another miserable week for President Donald Trump. Job growth was revised downward by 911,000 from April to March. Inflation ticked up again, partly due to the new tariffs imposed. Jamie Dimon of J.P. Morgan Chase warned that the economy is definitely in a slowdown. Israel hit  Doha, Qatar, an ally that has been hosting peace talks, neutralizing the president's effort to persuade Hamas to accept terms for a ceasefire. Trump insulted Tom Hanks, and Congress released his birthday message to Jeffrey Epstein — which he denied writing. Tyler Robinson had been the subject of an intense FBI manhunt. His surrender was a relief, but not to the millions who mourned Kirk. With Kirk's murder, we seem to be — thanks to the woke Democrats and Democratic judges not doing their jobs — drifting into anarchy. The Russian incursion into Polish airspace consisted of over a dozen drones. Anyone who believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is interested in peace should have their head examined. The Israeli attack on Qatar is thoroughly justified by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1343, which makes it improper for any member of the United Nations to aid, harbor, or otherwise support terrorists. Nevertheless, Trump and Arab nations condemned the raid. The small increase in inflation is almost certainly due to Trump's tariffs. The Supreme Court will decide his authority on tariffs soon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. When graphic videos go viral, like the recent fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk, it can feel impossible to protect yourself from seeing things you did not consent to see. But there are steps you can take. Social media platforms are designed to maximize engagement, not protect your peace of mind. You do not have to watch every piece of content that crosses your screen, however. Protecting your own mental state is not avoidance or denial. As a researcher who studies ways to counteract the negative effects of social media on mental health and well-being, I believe it's a way of safeguarding the bandwidth you need to stay engaged, compassionate and effective. Research shows that repeated exposure to violent or disturbing media can increase stress, heighten anxiety and contribute to feelings of helplessness. Over time, they erode the emotional resources you rely on to care for yourself and others. Protecting your attention is a form of care. Liberating your attention from harmful content is not withdrawal. Just as with food, not everything on the table is meant to be eaten. In the same way, not every piece of media laid out in your feed deserves your attention. Choosing what to consume is a matter of health. Read more: Is there any hope for the internet? And while you can choose what you keep in your own kitchen cabinets, you often have less control over what shows up in your feeds. Fortunately, there are straightforward ways to reduce your chances of being confronted with violent or disturbing videos. Its algorithms are engineered to hold your attention, even when that means amplifying harmful or sensational material. The urge to follow along in real time can be strong, especially during crises. Looking away protects your ability to act with purpose. When your attention is steady, you can choose where to invest it. Every boundary you set – whether it is turning off autoplay, filtering content or curating your feed – is a way of taking control over what enters your mind. These actions are the foundation for being able to connect with others, help people and work for meaningful change.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The union that represents tens of thousands of actors and other entertainment and media professionals has elected Sean Astin as its new president. On Friday, SAG-AFTRA elected Astin — an actor who appeared in “The Lord of the Rings,” “Stranger Things” and “Rudy” — to succeed Fran Drescher as its president. Sean Astin defeated Chuck Slavin in a 79% to 21% vote. Michelle Hurd was elected secretary-treasurer. Patty Duke, Sean Astin's mother, served as the Screen Actors Guild's president from 1985-1988. According to its website, SAG-AFTRA brings together Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. It represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, broadcast journalists, dancers, DJs, program hosts, recording artists and others. Under Drescher, the union has navigated a pair of strikes involving film and television actors and a separate one involving video game and interactive media performers. An earlier version of this story included a headline that misspelled Patty Duke's first name.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? In the early hours of Saturday morning, the California State Assembly voted 29 to 8 in favor of SB 53, a bill that would require transparency reports from the developers of highly powerful, “frontier” AI models. Gavin Newsom to either be vetoed or signed into law. The models targeted represent the cutting-edge of AI — extremely adept generative systems that require massive amounts of data and computing power, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, xAI's Grok, and Anthropic's Claude. AI can offer tremendous benefits, but as the bill is meant to address, it's not without risks. And while there is no shortage of existing risks from issues like job displacement and bias, SB 53 focuses on possible “catastrophic risks” from AI. Such risks include AI-enabled biological weapons attacks and rogue systems carrying out cyberattacks or other criminal activity that could conceivably bring down critical infrastructure. Such catastrophic risks represent widespread disasters that could plausibly threaten human civilization at local, national, and global levels. They represent risks of the kind of AI-driven disasters that have not yet occurred, rather than already-realized, more personal harms like AI deepfakes. It's hard to define catastrophic risk in law when the definition is far from settled, but doing so can help us protect against both near- and long-term consequences. By itself, a single state bill focused on increased transparency will probably not be enough to prevent devastating cyberattacks and AI-enabled chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons. But the bill represents an effort to regulate this fast-moving technology before it outpaces our efforts at oversight. SB 53 is the third state-level bill to try to specifically focus on regulating AI's catastrophic risks, after California's SB 1047, which passed the legislature only to be vetoed by the governor — and New York's Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, which recently passed the New York legislature and is now awaiting Gov. SB 53, which was introduced by state Sen. Scott Wiener in February, requires frontier AI companies to develop safety frameworks that specifically detail how they approach catastrophic risk reduction. Before deploying their models, companies would have to publish safety and security reports. The bill also gives them 15 days to report “critical safety incidents” to the California Office of Emergency Services, and establishes whistleblower protections for employees who come forward about unsafe model deployment that contributes to catastrophic risk. SB 53 aims to hold companies publicly accountable for their AI safety commitments, with a financial penalty up to $1 million per violation. “The science of how to make AI safe is rapidly evolving, and it's currently difficult for policymakers to write prescriptive technical rules for how companies should manage safety.” Both cover large models that are trained at 10^26 FLOPS, a measurement of very significant computing power used in a variety of AI legislation as a threshold for significant risk, and both bills strengthen whistleblower protections. While SB 1047 aimed to hold companies liable for catastrophic harms caused by their AI systems, SB 53 formalizes sharing safety frameworks, which many frontier AI companies, including Anthropic, already do voluntarily. It focuses squarely on the heavy-hitters, with its rules applying only to companies that generate $500 million or more in gross revenue. “The science of how to make AI safe is rapidly evolving, and it's currently difficult for policymakers to write prescriptive technical rules for how companies should manage safety,” said Thomas Woodside, the co-founder of Secure AI Project, an advocacy group that aims to reduce extreme risks from AI and is a sponsor of the bill, over email. “This light touch policy prevents backsliding on commitments and encourages a race to the top rather than a race to the bottom.” Newsom vetoed SB 1047, he commissioned a working group focusing solely on frontier models. “I would guess, with roughly 75 percent confidence, that SB 53 will be signed into law by the end of September,” said Dean Ball — former White House AI policy adviser, vocal SB 1047 critic, and SB 53 supporter — to Transformer. But several industry organizations rallied in opposition, arguing that additional compliance regulation would be expensive, given that AI companies should already be incentivized to avoid catastrophic harms. OpenAI has lobbied against it, and technology trade group Chamber of Progress argues that the bill would require companies to file unnecessary paperwork and unnecessarily stifle innovation. “The bill, if passed, would feed California regulators truckloads of company information that they will use to design a compliance industrial complex.” By contrast, Anthropic enthusiastically endorsed the bill on Monday. “The question isn't whether we need AI governance – it's whether we develop it thoughtfully today or reactively tomorrow,” the company explained in a blog post. “SB 53 offers a solid path toward the former.” (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI, while Future Perfect is funded in part by the BEMC Foundation, whose major funder was also an early investor in Anthropic. “A federally led transparency approach is far, far, far preferable to the multi-state alternative,” where a patchwork of state regulations can conflict with each other, said Cato Institute technology policy fellow Matthew Mittelsteadt in an email. But “I love that the bill has a provision that would allow companies to defer to a future alternative federal standard.” “The natural question is whether a federal approach can even happen,” Mittelsteadt continued. It's been less than 3 years since ChatGPT was released. But in a time of federal gridlock, frontier AI advancements won't wait for Washington. The bill's focus on, and framing of, catastrophic risks is not without controversy. The hope is that if these doomsday scenarios are identified and prepared for, they can be prevented or at least mitigated. There are longtermists, people focused primarily on humanity's far future, who place a premium on things like multiplanetary expansion for human survival. They're often chiefly concerned by risks from rogue AI or extremely lethal pandemics. Neartermists are more preoccupied with existing risks, like climate change, mosquito vector-borne disease, or algorithmic bias. These camps can blend into one another — neartermists would also like to avoid getting hit by asteroids that could wipe out a city, and longtermists don't dismiss risks like climate change — and the best way to think of them is like two ends of a spectrum rather than a strict binary. AI safety focuses on catastrophic risks and potential existential threats. But, as Vox's Julia Longoria reported in the Good Robot series for Unexplainable, there are inter-personal conflicts leading these two factions to work against each other, much of which has to do with emphasis. (AI ethics people argue that catastrophic risk concerns over-hype AI capabilities and ignores its impact on vulnerable people right now, while AI safety people worry that if we focus too much on the present, we won't have ways to mitigate larger-scale problems down the line.) But behind the question of near versus long-term risks lies another one: what, exactly, constitutes a catastrophic risk? While the average person might consider, say, many people driven to suicide after interacting with AI chatbots to be catastrophic, such a risk is outside of the bill's scope. (The California State Assembly just passed a separate bill to regulate AI companion chatbots by preventing them from participating in discussions about suicidal ideation or sexually explicit material.) SB 53 focuses squarely on harms from “expert-level” frontier AI model assistance in developing or deploying chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons; committing crimes like cyberattacks or fraud; and “loss of control” scenarios where AIs go rogue, behaving deceptively to avoid being shut down and replicating themselves without human oversight. For example, an AI model could be used to guide the creation of a new deadly virus that infects millions and kneecaps the global economy. I think that's like a very serious set of issues that demands policymaker attention, but I don't think it's the core of what this bill is trying to address.” Transparency is helpful in preventing such catastrophes because it can help raise the alarm before things get out of hand, allowing AI developers to correct course. And in the event that such efforts fail to prevent a mass casualty incident, enhanced safety transparency can help law enforcement and the courts figure out what went wrong. The challenge there is that it can be difficult to determine how much a model is accountable for a specific outcome, Irene Solaiman, the chief policy officer at Hugging Face, a collaboration platform for AI developers, told me over email. “These risks are coming and we should be ready for them and have transparency into what the companies are doing,” said Adam Billen, the vice president of public policy at Encode, an organization that advocates for responsible AI leadership and safety. But right now, when those things aren't happening at a large scale, it makes sense to be sort of focused on transparency.” However, a transparency-focused bill like SB 53 is insufficient for addressing already-existing harms. When we already know something is a problem, the focus should be on mitigating it. “Maybe four years ago, if we had passed some sort of transparency legislation like SB 53 but focused on those harms, we might have had some warning signs and been able to intervene before the widespread harms to kids started happening,” Billen said. “We're trying to kind of correct that mistake on these problems and get some sort of forward-facing information about what's happening before things get crazy, basically.” SB 53 risks being both overly narrow and unclearly scoped. We have not yet faced these catastrophic harms from frontier AI models, and the most devastating risks might take us entirely by surprise. It's also certainly possible that models trained below 10^26 FLOPS, which aren't covered by SB 53, have the potential to cause catastrophic harm under the bill's definition. As it stands right now, SB 53 occupies a different niche from bills focused on regulating AI use in mental healthcare or data privacy, reflecting its authors' desire not to step on the toes of other legislation or bite off more than it can reasonably chew. But Chilson, the Abundance Institute's head of AI policy, is part of a camp that sees SB 53's focus on catastrophic harm as a “distraction” from the real near-term benefits and concerns, like AI's potential to accelerate the pace of scientific research or create nonconsensual deepfake imagery, respectively. “I do think some of the lines between these things in practice can be a bit blurry, and I think in some ways…that is not necessarily a bad thing,” he told me. It could be that the ideological debate around what qualifies as catastrophic risks, and whether that's worthy of our legislative attention, is just noise. The average person isn't going to worry about the likelihood of AI sparking nuclear warfare or biological weapons attacks, but they do think about how algorithmic bias might affect their lives in the present. If they're effective, forward-facing safety provisions designed to prevent mass casualty events will also make AI safer for individuals. Newsom signs SB 53 into law, it could inspire other state attempts at AI regulation through a similar framework, and eventually encourage federal AI safety legislation to move forward.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BASKING RIDGE, N.J. (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday he believes the Russia-Ukraine war would end if all NATO countries stopped buying oil from Russia and placed tariffs on China of 50% to 100% for its purchases of Russian petroleum. Trump posted on his social media site that NATO'S commitment to winning the war “has been far less than 100%" and the purchase of Russian oil by some members of the alliance is “shocking.” As if speaking with NATO members, he said: “It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia.” Since 2023, NATO member Turkey has been the third largest buyer of Russian oil, after China and India. according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Other members of the 32-state alliance involved in purchasing Russian oil include Hungary and Slovakia. It's unclear whether Trump would want to directly confront Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan or Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. That leaves uncertain whether the threats might actually lead to new tariffs or a ban on Russian oil purchases. Trump's post arrives after the Wednesday flight of multiple Russian drones into Poland, an escalatory move by Russia as it was entering the airspace of a NATO ally. The U.S. and its allies are seeking to show a firmer degree of resolve against Russia. Ambassador Dorothy Shea said America “will defend every inch of NATO territory” and that the drones entering Poland “intentionally or otherwise show immense disrespect for good-faith U.S. efforts to bring an end to this conflict.” Britain on Friday also took steps to penalize the trading of Russian oil, including a ban on 70 vessels allegedly used in its transportation. Trump in his post Saturday said a NATO ban on Russian oil plus tariffs on China would “also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR.” The U.S. president has already imposed a 25% import tax on goods from India, specifically for its buying of Russian energy products. He has placed in total a 50% tariff on India, though Trump has indicated that negotiations with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi could help settle differences. The prospect of further import tax hikes on China and its retaliation could carry collateral damage for the U.S. and European economies. Taxes at that level were essentially a blockade on commerce between the world's two largest economies, causing worries about global growth that led to negotiations that ratcheted down the tariffs being levied by both nations. So that trade talks could proceed, America lowered its tariffs against China to a still-high 30%, while China took its rate to 10%. In his post, the Republican president said responsibility for the war fell on his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He did not include in that list Putin, who launched the invasion.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spencer Cox, left, and FBI Director Kash Patel, right, converse as they make their way to a press conference to speak to media about the shooting death of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, on Thursday, Sept. 11, 2025. FBI Director Kash Patel, center, arrives at the scene of the shooting death of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, on Thursday, Sept. 11, 2025. The two men who had been detained were quickly released, and Utah officials acknowledged that the gunman remained at large. The false assurance was more than a slip. It spotlighted the high-stakes uncertainty surrounding Patel's leadership of the bureau when its credibility — and his own — are under extraordinary pressure. Patel now approaches congressional oversight hearings this coming week facing not just questions about that investigation but broader doubts about whether he can stabilize a federal law enforcement agency fragmented by political fights and internal upheaval. Democrats are poised to press Patel on a purge of senior executives that has prompted a lawsuit, his pursuit of President Donald Trump's grievances long after the Russia investigation ended, and a realignment of resources that has prioritized the fight against illegal immigration and street crime even though the agency has for decades been defined by its work on complicated threats like counterintelligence and public corruption. That's in addition to questions about the handling of files from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case, the addition of a co-deputy director to serve alongside Dan Bongino, and the use of polygraphs on some agents in recent months to identify sources of leaks. “Because of the skepticism that some members of the Senate have had and still have, it's extremely important that he perform very well at these oversight hearings” on Tuesday and Wednesday, said Gregory Brower, a former FBI executive who served as its top congressional affairs official. Kirk's killing was always going to be a closely scrutinized investigation, not only because it was the latest burst of political violence inside the United States but also because of Kirk's friendships with Trump, Patel and other administration figures and allies. Spencer Cox said at a near-contemporaneous news conference that “Whoever did this, we will find you,” suggesting authorities were still searching. Patel soon after posted that the person in custody had been released. “That does not deliver the message that you want the public to hear,” said Chris O'Leary, a retired FBI counterterrorism executive. People start to wonder what is going in. This looks like the Keystone Cops and it continues to get worse.” The next day, a scheduled afternoon news conference was canceled for “rapid developments” as Patel and Bongino flew to Utah. As the search stretched on for over a day, Patel angrily vented to FBI personnel Thursday about what he perceived as a failure to keep him informed, including that he was not quickly shown a photograph of the suspected shooter. On Friday morning, authorities announced the arrest at a news conference where Patel claimed credit for certain investigative steps, saying, “At my direction, the FBI released the first set of FBI photos.” Patel's overall response did not go unnoticed in conservative circles. One prominent strategist, Christopher Rufo, posted on X that it was “time for Republicans to assess whether Kash Patel is the right man to run the FBI.” On the same day Kirk was killed, Patel faced a separate problem: a lawsuit from three FBI senior executives fired in an August purge that wiped away decades of institutional experience and that they characterized as a Trump administration retribution campaign. Driscoll alleged in the lawsuit that he was let go following a clash with Patel over administration demands to fire an FBI pilot who'd been wrongly identified on social media as the case agent in the classified documents investigation of Trump. The other plaintiffs are Spencer Evans, a former top agent in Las Vegas whose termination letter cited a “lack of reasonableness and overzealousness” in implementing COVID-19 policies while serving as a human resources official — a claim his lawyers call false — and Steve Jensen, who helped oversee FBI investigations into the Jan. 6. The upheaval continues a trend that began even before Patel took over, when more than a half-dozen of the bureau's most senior executives were forced out under a Justice Department rationale that they could not be “trusted” to implement Trump's agenda. There's since been significant turnover in leadership at the FBI's 55 field offices. Some left because of promotions and planned retirements, but others because of ultimatums to accept new assignments or resign. The head of the Salt Lake City office, an experienced counterterrorism investigator, was pushed out of her position weeks before Kirk was killed at a Utah college, said people familiar with the move. In July, an agent based in Norfolk, Virginia, Michael Feinberg, authored a first-person account saying he was told to brace for a demotion and a polygraph exam because of his friendship with Peter Strzok , a lead FBI agent in the investigation into ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign fired over derogatory text messages sent about Trump. Patel arrived at the FBI having been a sharp critic of its leadership, including for investigations into Trump that he says politicized the institution. Under Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, the FBI and Justice Department have become entangled in their own politically fraught inquiries, such as one into New York Attorney General Letitia James. Trump has routinely called that probe, which did not establish a criminal conspiracy between Russia and Trump's campaign, a “hoax” and “witch hunt.” The Justice Department appeared to confirm in an unusual statement that it was investigating former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan, pivotal players in the Russia saga listed by Patel in a book he authored as “members of the Executive Branch Deep State,” but did not say for what. Bondi has directed that evidence be presented to a grand jury, and agents and prosecutors have begun requesting information and interviews from former officials related to the investigation, according to multiple people familiar with the outreach. The FBI has been key to the federal government's takeover of the Washington police department, participating with partner agencies in arrests for crimes, like drunken driving, not historically thought of as central FBI priorities. The bureau makes no apologies for aggressive policing in American cities the Trump administration contends have been consumed by crime. Patel and Bongino have been promoting the number of arrests involving federal law enforcement in an initiative they dub Operation Summer Heat. Patel says the thousands of cumulative arrests, many of them immigration-related, are “what happens when you let good cops be good cops.” But some are concerned the street crime focus could draw attention from the sophisticated public corruption and national security threats for which the bureau has long been primarily, if not solely, responsible for investigating.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal appeals court ruled on Friday to allow the Trump administration to go forward with stripping protections away from around 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. “We recognize the risks of irreparable harm persuasively laid out in the district court's order: that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month — a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries,” the judges wrote. Esther Sung, the legal director of Justice Action Center and a co-counsel in the case, says the decision will “hurt everyone.” “People who came here from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela did everything the government asked of them, and the Trump administration cruelly and nonsensically failed to hold up the government's end of the bargain,” Sung said. “While we are deeply disappointed by this decision, we will continue to advocate zealously for our clients and class members as the litigation continues.” The Justice Department had argued that it has the power to revoke the temporary protections and that the Department of Homeland Security should be able to do so without court interference. But plaintiffs argued that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem needed to end protections individually and not across the board. “The district court applied the law correctly and did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Secretary Noem's action inflicted irreparable injury on the class members (among others) and that the public interest and balance of the equities tip sharply in favor of preliminary relief,” attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in a brief. President Donald Trump's administration aims to deport a record number of people. The administration has sought court rulings, more detention centers, and more immigration officers and resources for them to contribute to that goal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? If you've been paying any attention to the fractious debate over American health policy, you've probably heard this phrase: “the sickest generation in American history.” The words can be found in the third sentence of a major report released in May by a presidential commission led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but the line itself essentially sums up the ethos of his Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement. America, and especially its children, is “the sickest country in the world,” as Kennedy himself told senators in a hearing earlier this month. A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world. If it's true, then what choice do we have but to blow up the American health care system and remake it from top to bottom? Which is exactly what Kennedy aims to do. Well, I'm here with some good news: It is not true. Does this mean that Americans are as healthy as they could be, or that we aren't seeing significant new health problems arise alongside that progress, like the growth of obesity, the spread of chronic diseases, and the rise of diagnosed mental illness? But one of the goals of this newsletter is to help put the very real problems of the present into perspective by understanding how far we've come from a much darker past. On that final score, today's Americans are better off on average than virtually any who came before them. In the late 19th century, even as US cities were first being wired for electricity, life expectancy in the US was just 40 years — a sobering thought for someone like myself who is currently 47. The science writer Steven Johnson has a brilliant description for this phenomenon: it's as if Americans across the board gained “an extra life.” And while the long-term increase in US life expectancy reversed slightly during the Covid pandemic, it has since recovered. Today the average American can expect to live 78.4 years, or nearly twice as long as their great-great-great-grandparent born in the 1880s. One of the biggest factors behind all that extra life is medicine's success against infectious disease. In 1900, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and diarrheal disease caused roughly one-third of all American deaths — and 30 percent of those deaths were in children under 5. Today, just a fraction of Americans die from infectious disease. Diseases like polio are a thing of the past thanks to vaccines, and the more recent contagion of HIV — which killed nearly half a million Americans between the early 1980s and the late 1990s — has now become a manageable condition thanks to amazing advances in antiviral treatments. One of the reasons the Covid pandemic was so overwhelming was that Americans had lost any experience with a widespread new infectious disease, and even there, estimates are that mRNA vaccines developed at lightning speed prevented millions of deaths. As deaths from infectious disease dropped over the last century, Americans have increasingly begun to die from noninfectious diseases like heart attacks and cancer. In a way, this was a sign of health success — these diseases strike later in life, and living longer meant more Americans were reaching the age where cancer and cardiovascular disease become a threat. But despite some concerning data like the rise of some cancers in younger people, overall deaths from cancer have been consistently falling for decades, while heart attacks are far less fatal now than they were 50 years ago. Fire up an episode of Mad Men and tell me those guys are healthier than we are today. America in the 1960s and '70s was a highly polluted place, where environmental hazards directly harmed human health. Cars still ran on leaded gasoline, burning 200,000 tons of highly neurotoxic lead each year, with the result that an estimated half of US children at the time were exposed to adverse levels. Smog blanketed our cities, and water supplies received far less treatment. Today, water and air in America are far cleaner. Cumulative emissions of six major air pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide fell 78 percent between 1970, the baseline year for the monumental Clean Air Act, and 2023. That last bit is especially important — lead is highly toxic to children, leading to lower IQs and other developmental problems. The fact that children today have blood levels that are on average 96 percent lower than children in the late 1970s is an astounding improvement in public health. (Though not so great for me, given that I was a child in the late 1970s.) One other way in which the safety of our environment has improved: Both vehicles and workplaces are less dangerous than they used to be. The per-mile fatality rate, though still too high, is about quarter what it was in 1970, while the car crash death rate for children under 13 has fallen 81 percent since 1975. Total workplace deaths have fallen by about 60 percent since 1970, even as the size of the American workforce has increased. What about the health conditions in children, like autism and ADHD, that have really spiked in recent decades? As my Vox colleague Dylan Scott wrote this year, much of that apparent increase represents liberalizing diagnostic criteria, which have broadened to encompass many more children. The rate of US children with high-support needs autism, for instance, has only marginally grown over the past 30 years. In short, we're diagnosing more kids who previously would have been missed. That's a good thing if it gets them needed support earlier, but it does not back up the thesis that this generation of children is uniquely sick. In fact, some doctors now believe that medicine has a broader problem of overdiagnosis in everything from mental health to certain kinds of cancer, both because of social changes in how health is viewed and improved testing methods picking up milder forms of disease that would have gone undetected in the past. “The bottom line is if you screen healthy people for an illness, any illness, be it cancer or high blood pressure, diabetes, then you will be picking up borderline cases and overtreating them,” Dr. Suzanne O'Sullivan, the author of The Age of Diagnosis: How Our Obsession With Medical Labels Is Making Us Sicker, told Vox in May. But I challenge anyone to go back to a time when one in every 10 American children died before the age of one, or when HIV was a clear death sentence, or when urban air was choked with smog, and tell me that we live in a uniquely sick time. The way to address the very real health challenges we face today is not, as so much of MAHA wants, to destroy the foundation of the public health achievements we enjoy today, but rather to build on them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Manchester United and Portugal winger Luís Nani has an encouraging message of hope for the Red Devils' beleaguered fans: Things are about to get a whole lot better. United recently endured its worst ever finish to a Premier League season and already in this campaign, Ruben Amorim's men have suffered a humiliating League Cup defeat to fourth-division Grimsby Town despite the acquisition of expensive new forwards Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Šeško. And now since that loss, young Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens has been added to the squad. “Everyone is expecting the new players to shine, so the stress doesn't help,” Nani, a four-time Premier League winner with United, told CNN Sports ahead of this weekend's Manchester derby. “I believe, in a few games more, everything will settle, and we'll get the normal winning our games, really compete and be one of the best teams in the Premier League. The club's current plight is a far cry from the Alex Ferguson glory days when United won a record 13 Premier League titles and was a two-time Champions League winner. A key member of that all-conquering history was flying winger Nani – a generational talent who was part of the Red Devils team that won the Champions League in 2008, and was inducted into Liga Portugal's Hall of Fame earlier this week. A former international teammate of Amorim, Nani – who scored over 40 goals during his time in the Premier League – is well qualified to assess his compatriot's impact on United so far. He's young and obviously needs to experience much more in the Premier League. The Premier League is not easy for any coach. But we know the passion from the fans and the time is making his life even worse, giving him so much stress, so much pressure to deliver it,” Nani said. 2011 was a year to remember for Nani, especially when it came to scoring against rival Manchester City – netting twice against the Citizens in a Community Shield victory. “And last season, they didn't play well. So, I don't see them winning the title, but it's always a team who will be there to compete and then make things difficult for any team on top of the table.” In addition to his United successes, Nani made history with the Portuguese national team becoming a European champion at EURO 2016; he would go on to make over 100 appearances for his nation. Nani was an exciting, skillful winger, and in the early part of his career in England, a one-time housemate of storied compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo. “We experienced the best youth together in Man United. We have the tennis court to enjoy ourselves after our sessions at United. So, I think it was a great privilege to be part of those memories.” Despite having no food to eat on certain days, Nani nevertheless describes his childhood as a happy one. “Even with all the difficulties, having no food, not having clothes to dress in every single day – I had to sometimes wear clothes with holes in my jeans and shirts and my shoes – but even with all that, I was happy because I remember the only thing I wanted to do was to play football on the streets with my friends,” said Nani. “Me and my friends, we always challenge ourselves. We would take an orange or any other type of fruit they had there. In an emotional video, Nani announced his retirement from soccer in 2024 following a decorated career that spanned two decades, including spells in his homeland, Spain, Turkey, Italy, Australia and the US. Nani's decision to call time on his playing days was taken in part due to the passing of his father and a desire to spend more time with family. A post shared by Nani Football Academy (@nanifootballacademy_) He now has a renewed purpose in life empowering young, aspiring players at the Nani Football Academy, which opened late last year in his homeland. “I always tell them to trust in themselves and never give up. Try always to do your best in anything you're doing,” said Nani. “In my academy, that's just football and I try to teach them everything that I passed through my youth. “And I give some examples of my life because I can see a lot of kids, the mentality side is not so strong because they don't have the same difficulties we had in the past. So, I try to create different difficulties for them. “It's like when they are there, they're learning how to survive in this world, how to behave, how to be a good person but, at the same time, a strong person, strong mentality. To be prepared for this world – that's the basis of our environment.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spencer Cox's campaign to turn down the nation's political temperature has long stood out as a rarity in a Republican Party led by President Donald Trump. It also laid bare a sharp divide within the GOP over the way forward, even as prominent Democrats and some Republicans praised Cox's performance before a national audience Friday. Among those who count Cox as a close friend is Wes Moore, Maryland's Democratic governor. Moore said he thought Cox had shown “the importance of being authentic.” And that's one of the things I love about him most.” “He's just a deeply good human being,” he added, “and I'm thankful that in this moment of real tension in our country, that Spencer is helping to lead us through.” “I desperately call on every American – Republican, Democrat, liberal, progressive, conservative, MAGA, all of us – to please, please, please follow what Charlie taught me,” Cox said Friday, sharing a lesson he recounted from Kirk: “Always forgive your enemies – nothing annoys them so much.” In 2022, as Cox was about to veto a ban on transgender youth athletes playing in girls' sports, Kirk tweeted: “Utah Governor Spencer Cox should be expelled from the Republican party.” Cox wrote in his message to legislative leaders that he had tried “to err on the side of kindness, mercy and compassion.” Still, the legislature overrode his veto. Steve Bannon, the Kirk and Trump ally, alluded to that veto on his “War Room” podcast Friday and called Cox “a governor who's also known, I think, to be particularly obnoxious.” Underscoring the divisions among conservatives, Utah Sen. John Curtis, a Republican, sounded similar notes to his state's governor Friday on CNN. “Every one of us, every morning, should wake up, look in the mirror, and see what we are doing in our own personal relationships.” Cox on Friday did not directly address Trump's earlier suggestion of blaming the “radical left” for Kirk's murder. Yet his words stood in stark contrast to the president's. He built a political brand that extended beyond party labels. “Although we sit on different sides of the aisle, we are both committed to American civility and a peaceful transition of power,” Cox said in the ad. “Because of that miracle,” Cox said, “you have the opportunity to do something that no other person on earth can do right now: unify and save our country.” Jared Polis featured Cox saying the two were “here to help save your family dinners.” Another, with Moore, featured the two discussing their love for basketball and joking about their own baldness. “Politics is important, but it shouldn't define us or destroy our relationships,” Cox says in the video. Cox and Moore were together last week for a National Press Club lunch, where they discussed the inevitability of crises that governors face. Moore's came last March, when the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed. Moore said he reached out to Cox as soon as he heard about Kirk's assassination, and the two have spoken every day since. Cox on Friday also renewed his call for all Americans, particularly the nation's youth, to disengage from social media and forge a connection with whom they agree and disagree. “You are inheriting a country where politics feels like rage. It feels like rage is the only option,” Cox said. “Your generation has an opportunity to build a culture that is very different than what we are suffering through right now, not by pretending differences don't matter but by embracing our differences and having those hard conversations.” Cox described social media as “a cancer,” and urged those watching to “log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member, go out and do good in your community.” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz posted on X: “I know this guy is a Republican and all but I swear you could win all the electoral votes with this message in 28.” Curtis, the Republican senator, said Cox's urging of Americans to sign off social media was “one of the wisest things I think he said today.” Cox also drew praise from conservative media outlets for his highlighting of Utah's reaction to Kirk's death. Moore, often mentioned as a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender himself, said if Cox — who won a hard-fought 2020 gubernatorial primary — wants to run for the White House, he shouldn't be underestimated. “Anyone who thinks that his message could not resonate in the Republican Party, I think you're underestimating the hunger the country has for unified leadership — for a person who brings us together rather than tearing us apart,” Moore said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Facebook users who filed a claim in parent company Meta's $725 million settlement related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal may soon get a payment. It's been over two years since Facebook users were able to file claims in Meta's December 2022 settlement. The class-action lawsuit began after the social media giant said in 2018 that as many as 87 million Facebook users' private information was obtained by data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, which had worked with President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. Meta was accused of allowing Cambridge Analytica and other third parties, including developers, advertisers and data brokers, to access private information about Facebook users. Meta did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Following the Cambridge Analytica incident, Facebook restricted third-party access to user data and “developed more robust tools” to inform users about how data is collected and shared, according to court documents. Here's what you need to know about the settlement payments. Any US Facebook user who had an active account between May 24, 2007, and December 22, 2022, was eligible to file a claim, even if they have deleted the account. Almost 29 million claims were filed and about 18 million were validated as of September 2023, according to Meta's response in a 2024 legal document. According to the settlement site, payments would be determined by whether a claim was valid and “how long you were a user on Facebook” between May 24, 2007, and December 22, 2022. Two appeals were filed after the settlement that were not resolved until May 14, 2025, according to the settlement site. The settlement was finalized on May 22, 2025, and on August 27, the court ordered that settlement benefits be distributed. “The distribution of settlement benefits has commenced and will continue for approximately 10 weeks. We thank you in advance for your patience,” according to the site's September 3 update. Anyone who is unsure about the status of their claim can contact the settlement administrator at info@facebookuserprivacysettlement.com, with their claim ID. According to the settlement plan, a system of “allocation points” will determine payments. One allocation point is assigned for each calendar month a person had a Facebook account between May 24, 2007, and December 22, 2022. “Class members who were active on Facebook longer, and who therefore may have more valuable claims, will receive a larger share of the settlement,” Meta said in the 2024 legal document. Payments will either be sent directly to the bank account provided on the claim form, or via PayPal, a virtual prepaid Mastercard, Venmo or Zelle. Unsuccessful or expired payments will receive a “second chance email” to update the payment method.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Miller says that he will oblige with Kirk's request. “The last message that Charlie Kirk gave to me before he joined his creator in heaven was he said that we have to dismantle and take on the radical left organizations in this country that are fomenting violence. He said they could use RICO or conspiracy charges to punish chosen individuals. His alleged killer, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, has been captured by authorities and charged with aggravated murder, obstruction of justice, and felony discharge of a firearm. He wrote several messages on bullet casings, according to law enforcement and Utah Governor Spencer Cox, including on the casing of the bullet that killed Kirk: “notices bulge OwO what's this?” “Charlie was a patriot to my great fellow Americans. I am filled with grief and anger at the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk on a college campus in Utah. “My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it, as well as those who go after our judges, law enforcement officials, and everyone else who brings order to our country,” he said, going on to reference the assassination attempts against himself and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) and the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Some have mocked or celebrated Kirk's death, and the federal government has vowed to pursue those who have done so to discipline them. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon is actively searching for Kirk detractors or those who celebrated his death to impose punishment. “We are tracking all these very closely — and will address, immediately.</p>
