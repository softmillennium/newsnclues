                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fabian Dori, the chief investment officer at digital asset bank Sygnum, says that banks offering crypto-backed loans prefer crypto collateral in the form of onchain assets rather than exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and using onchain collateral can benefit borrowers. Dori said that onchain assets are more liquid, allowing lenders to execute margin calls for crypto-backed loans on demand and offer higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios to borrowers because the lender can liquidate the collateral in real-time. A higher LTV ratio means the borrower is able to access more credit in relation to their posted crypto collateral, while a lower LTV means they will get a smaller loan for the same amount of collateral. Crypto-backed loans are still in their infancy, Dori said, but he was confident that the sector would continue to grow as crypto gains widespread adoption. Financial institutions are steadily embracing loans secured by crypto as crypto lenders go public on US stock exchanges, and traditional financial (TradFi) firms warm up to the idea of accepting crypto as loan collateral. Figure Technology, a crypto-backed lending company, made its debut on the Nasdaq exchange, a tech-focused US stock exchange, on Thursday. Shares of the company surged by over 24% during intraday trading on the first day, and the company currently has a market capitalization of over $6.8 billion, according to Yahoo Finance. Financial services company JP Morgan is also considering offering crypto-backed loans to clients, a development that would take place sometime in 2026 if the legacy financial giant moves forward with the idea.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The platform will now charge 1% on NFT trades, up from 0.5%, marking a 100% increase. The adjustment, announced by Chief Marketing Officer Adam Hollander in a lengthy update on X, takes effect September 15. This pool already holds $1 million in Optimism's OP and Arbitrum's ARB tokens, along with high-value NFTs. Rewards will be distributed through a gamified system of treasure chests, designed to keep traders engaged before the SEA token launch. OpenSea introduced a mobile application it calls “AI-native.” The app integrates user portfolios across multiple chains. The company launched its Flagship Collection with over $1 million allocated to acquiring historic NFTs like CryptoPunks. These actions show that OpenSea wants to be more than just a marketplace. It also aims to act as a curator and trading assistant. With AI, unique collections, and token rewards, the company is set to stay relevant in a highly competitive world. The SEA token, expected in early October, is being promoted as more than just another marketplace currency. OpenSea's foundation has hinted at sustainable mechanics and strong reasons for long-term holding.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gemini Space Station, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, surged in its Nasdaq debut Friday after raising $425 million in an initial public offering. The company priced its IPO late Thursday at $28 a share, valuing Gemini at about $3.3 billion before trading began. That price was above the revised $24 to $26 range it set earlier in the week and well above the initial $17 to $19 range. Shares climbed as high as $45.89 during intraday trading before settling at $32, still 14% above the IPO level by the close. Gemini, headquartered in New York, operates a suite of crypto services including a spot exchange, custody solutions for institutions, a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, a crypto rewards credit card, and staking products. Filings show Gemini lost $159 million in 2024 and $283 million in the first half of 2025. Tyler Winklevoss described bitcoin as “gold 2.0” and said adoption remains in the “first inning.” He and his brother projected that bitcoin could reach $1 million within the next decade. Gemini's listing follows those of Coinbase (COIN) in April 2021 and Bullish (BLSH), which owns CoinDesk, last month. Bitcoin Climbs as Economy Cracks — Is it Bullish or Bearish?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dogecoin Price Skyrockets as DOGE Massively Outpaces Bitcoin, Ethereum Gains DOGE is having its day (again), with Dogecoin putting up enormous gains on the week amid growing corporate and institutional interest in the O.G. At a current price of $0.299, DOGE has pumped by about 40% over the last week. Other major coins have had strong weeks, as well, with Solana up 18% during that span and XRP putting up a nearly 12% jump. It's also crushing recent gains by Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are up 4.5% and about 9% over the last week, respectively. Dogecoin is finally getting some institutional attention after analysts told Decrypt that the lack of it was contributing to Dogecoin remaining well below its all-time high mark from 2021, while other major coins hit recent highs. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, DOGE hasn't had big companies loading up on it or ETFs driving investor demand. This week, publicly traded CleanCore Solutions—which trades as ZONE on the NYSE American—started amassing sizable amounts of Dogecoin, buying over 500 million DOGE now worth about $148 million. CleanCore's CIO Marco Margiotta said in a statement this week that it wants to make Dogecoin a serious reserve asset while expanding its use for payments and other financial services. It's an ambitious vision for what started as a joke cryptocurrency. There's also buzz around the first U.S. spot Dogecoin ETF from Rex-Osprey (ticker: DOJE), which will let regular investors buy into DOGE through their traditional brokers. It's been delayed multiple times now, with trading originally set to begin on Thursday, then Friday, and now expected to be sometime next week per Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas. But the delays haven't slowed Dogecoin's momentum in recent days, given the continued surge. The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pi Network has successfully upgraded its blockchain protocol to version 20 on its testnet, causing a 3% increase in the value of Pi Coin. This marks a critical step in the platform's long-term development, with more updates expected as the network moves towards version 23. Pi Network, which has millions of users worldwide, is gradually progressing with its upgrades, creating anticipation within the community. Dr. Altcoin, a Pi Network advocate, confirmed the change via social media, noting that this is an important milestone for Pi's journey. Pi Network's blockchain updates typically lead to heightened interest and engagement from both the community and investors, which is reflected in the positive price movement of Pi Coin. Following the protocol upgrade, Pi Coin has seen a modest increase in value. Over the past week, Pi Coin has shown a slight increase, although its performance over the last month and six months remains mixed. Pi Coin's price has faced significant volatility, with a decrease of nearly 10% in the last 30 days and a 75.65% drop over the past six months. However, its cumulative growth since launch is still substantial, with gains exceeding 250%. In addition to the blockchain upgrade, Pi Network is hosting a domain name auction, which runs until September 30. This auction allows Pi users to bid on domain names tied to the Pi ecosystem, further expanding its utility. This move is intended to encourage the creation of digital identities and services on Pi-powered domains, which can add value to the overall ecosystem. The domain auction represents a significant development in Pi Network's strategy to foster a broader use case for its blockchain. By allowing users to secure domain names, Pi Network is enhancing the possibilities for businesses and individuals to build on its platform.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A coalition of leading associations in the finance, tech, and digital sectors has written a letter to the UK government, urging it to include Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) as a core strand of the UK-US Tech Bridge. The US-UK Tech Bridge is a bilateral agreement between the two nations to collaborate and share resources on emerging innovations, technology, and digital policy. With Trump set to visit the UK from September 17-19, this letter comes at a crucial time as Britain looks to assert its dominance in the digital finance sector. Read on as we uncover what the letter proposes and highlight the best altcoins we think could benefit from growing government crypto adoption. The letter highlights two key sectors of DLT that the UK government must pay close attention to: tokenization and stablecoins. Amid growing competitive pressure, the letter recommends forming a joint sandbox with political backing to seize the opportunities of new technology and cement Britain's role as the world's leading hub for digital finance innovation. As the world's top financial powerhouses pivot toward digital assets such as tokenized securities and stablecoins, it's inevitable that the next few decades of global finance will be dominated by cryptocurrencies and the broader digital finance ecosystem. This is why forward-looking investors are actively identifying promising cryptocurrencies. If you want to make the most of this global shift, here are some of the top cryptos you should add to your portfolio right now. However, it still struggles with slow speeds and can only process 7 transactions per second since it handles them one by one. $HYPER, with its Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, enables parallel transaction processing, where multiple transactions can be processed simultaneously as long as they're not related to each other. This drastically increases throughput and speed while reducing transaction costs. At the core of this utility is a non-custodial, decentralized canonical bridge that locks up your L1 Bitcoin tokens to mint an equivalent amount of L2-compatible Bitcoin. This utility-driven approach has made the $HYPER presale a huge success, raising $15.5M so far. According to our $HYPER price prediction, the token could hit $0.32 in 2025, offering a massive 2,300% return from current levels. Visit Bitcoin Hyper's official website to learn how it will crank up BTC's real-world utility. Plus, there's always the lingering threat of arbitrary bans and account suspensions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump's war of words against the Federal Reserve and its chair Jerome Powell have shocked bitcoin, crypto and stock markets this year (with Trump now armed with a surprise, secret weapon). Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The row between Trump and the Fed has been brewing for years, with accusations of political bias beginning when Powell incorrectly called post-Covid lockdown inflation “transitory,” holding back from increasing interest rates in response to rising prices. The battle was turbo-charged when Powell surprised markets with a 50 basis point inflation hike in September last year, seen by some as a gift to Trump's Democratic Party election rival Kamala Harris. Earlier this year, Trump raised the possibility he could remove Powell before his term is up next year, spooking markets that fear the end of Federal Reserve political independence. Since then, Trump has tried to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook and installed Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) and a bitcoin supporter, as a temporary Fed governor.

This could end up being a far more serious issue," David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments. The bitcoin price and wider crypto market has surged over the last week, with bitcoin climbing 5% as traders feel emboldened by what's expected to be a dovish Fed pivot.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A wallet tied to the $300 million Coinbase hack bought 3,976 Ether for $18.9 million, doubling down on ETH amid its recent push above the $4,700 level. A crypto wallet linked to an infamous Coinbase hacker has bought another 3,976 Ether, worth over $18.9 million, at $4,756 per token, according to onchain data. The hacker consolidated various DAI amounts, ranging from $80,000 to $6 million, before executing multiple ETH buys. The Coinbase hacker wallet has been under surveillance by blockchain analysts since earlier this year. It's reportedly tied to a $300 million+ social engineering scam that targeted Coinbase users. In May, onchain sleuth and security analyst ZachXBT estimated that the campaign defrauded victims out of at least $330 million. “Our number is likely much lower than the actual amount stolen as our data was limited to my DMs and thefts we discovered onchain,” he said at the time.

Meanwhile, the latest Ether purchase comes as the price of ETH rose above $4,700 on Saturday to hit a local high of around $4,763, its highest level in more than two weeks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Uruguay Central Bank is researching digital currency plans, which is an indication of a change in the financial environment of the country with far-reaching consequences. This is in line with a world trend of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). This research is in light of knowing how this new money could be fitted within the economy of Uruguay. To spearhead this drive, the Central Bank has put in place a former senior-level manager who has experience in financial systems. This executive will examine the technical infrastructure, regulatory environment, and possible economic effects of a digital currency. It is an indication of a grave desire to modernize payments and money management. Digital currencies are able to provide cheaper and quicker transactions. Authorities are also concerned with the threat of security attacks, privacy matters, and financial sustainability. Uruguay will need proper protection in the event it chooses to proceed. There are various digital currency models, ranging from full replacements to cash complements. It is focused on financial inclusion. A large number of citizens do not have formal access to banking. Digital currency may introduce these people into the formal fiscal framework. This would enable easy saving and dealing in transactions. The Central Bank of Uruguay does not want to make premature decisions. He or she will make sure that it is a balanced solution, considering both positive and possible difficulties. The Uruguay exploration project is an indication that the country is open to financial innovation without compromising on conventional stability. Uruguay does not want to lag behind as countries around the world are trying digital money. It can also help in economic growth through better payment facilities. It will be announced formally after the analysis is done</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs are seeing renewed inflows as institutional appetite for crypto exposure continues to build. On Friday, spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs recorded $642.35 million in net inflows, marking the fifth straight day of gains, according to data from SoSoValue. This pushed cumulative net inflows to $56.83 billion, with total net assets now standing at $153.18 billion, roughly 6.62% of Bitcoin's total market cap. Trading volumes across all spot Bitcoin ETFs topped $3.89 billion, signaling robust activity and growing institutional positioning. Market leaders like IBIT and FBTC posted daily gains of over 2%. Related: Ether ETF inflows, explained: What they mean for traders Spot Ether (ETH) ETFs mirrored the bullish momentum, pulling in $405.55 million in daily net inflows on the same day, their fourth consecutive day of gains. “Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs keep seeing strong inflows, showing rising institutional confidence,” Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph. “If macro conditions hold, this surge could strengthen liquidity and drive momentum for both assets,” Liu added.
