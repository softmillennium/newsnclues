                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Someone has leaked a video of an unidentified anomalous phenomenon (UAP) — the military's preferred term for unidentified flying objects, better known as UFOs — to Congress. As USA Today reports, this never-before-seen video was provided anonymously to Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican and member of the House of Representative's UAP Caucus, and shows a bizarre encounter that occurred last October off the coast of Yemen. Although it's unclear what mission was occurring during the footage, it did occur the same time that the US and its allies were conducting strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen. October 30th, 2024: MQ-9 Reaper allegedly tracking orb off coast of Yemen. The strange object took the hit and was momentarily pushed off its trajectory by the missile, which also appeared to cause some debris to eject from it, before correcting course. As Military.com details, these missiles can be launched both air-to-air or air-to-ground, and are "capable of defeating any known tank in the world today." Whatever that orb was, in other words, its ability to bounce back from a Hellfire strike would suggest it was tougher than a tank. During the hearing, as USA Today notes, witnesses to the event — including three military veterans — said there is no known human technology that could survive a Hellfire hit. "That's the Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and just (bouncing) right off," Knapp said, per ABC News' write-up of the hearing. In response to ABC's requests for comment, a Department of Defense spokesperson demurred. "I have nothing for you," they said. Knapp, meanwhile, was glad that the video had been released, even if outside official channels.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bizarre flying objects are usually considered a stateside phenomena. The mysterious aerial entity was snapped outside of Shipton in Yorkshire by photographer and local man John Tunnah. Eerily, the Yorkshire resident took about 10 or 12 photographs from his vantage point but the object only appeared in one of them. Mr Tunnah said they were the 'first photos on an unfamiliar camera' that he had only just purchased. He described the phenomenon as a probable 'UFO' – an unidentified flying object. And it's remarkably similar to the classic UFO saucer shape depicted in popular culture, with a distinctive round and elongated shape. The bizarre saucer-shaped object was snapped with a Pentax Optio SVi camera by Yorkshire photographer John Tunnah The photo, shared exclusively with the Daily Mail, was taken with a Pentax Optio SVi camera one Saturday morning, according to Mr Tunnah. 'I was travelling home with it when I noticed, behind the hills beyond Silsden, a perfectly formed arch of cloud – like a cloudy rainbow,' he said. 'I'm not a "flying-saucer", or "alien visitation" freak, but whatever it was deserves the term UFO.' 'They all tended to agree that it was "real", "solid" and appeared to be travelling at speed from the dissipating "arch" on the horizon,' he said. The object is remarkably similar to the classic UFO saucer shape depicted in popular culture, with a distinctive round and elongated shape. Alternatively, it could be a fast-moving animal nearer the camera lens. 'Various theories were put forward – such as "flying saucer" and very short lived cloud.' Nick Pope, a UFO expert formerly with the UK's Ministry of Defence, offered a number of explanations for Mr Tunnah's photo. Most UFOs have been described as ‘orb', ‘round' or ‘sphere', but other reported shapes include polygon, triangle and 'Tic Tac', says the Pentagon Based on what it knows from reported sightings between 1996 and 2023, other UFO shapes include rectangle, oval, triangle, disk, cylinder, square and even polygon. Meanwhile, 16 per cent have been described as having lights, although in many cases this may have been due to their reflective qualities. An invasion of small metallic orbs has been spotted hovering over the US in recent years, leaving the Pentagon scrambling to identify these mysterious UFOs. A new report from the crowdsourced platform Enigma, which allows people to report sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs), reveals more than 8,000 sightings across the US between December 2022 and June 2025. Among these, 422 reports specifically describe metallic orbs, with the majority observed between 1am and 4am near military installations in New York, California, and Arizona. Eyewitnesses, including civilians, pilots, and military personnel, reported seeing the spheres hover silently before moving at extreme speeds, leaving no trace of their departure. Some of the sightings have been captured on video or radar, though many remain unexplained. By posting your comment you agree to our house rules. Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump's rumoured health issues have caught people's attention yet again after his face appeared to "droop" at the 9/11 memorial. But eagle-eyed observers were quick to suggest he may have had a stroke. Just last week, he was accused of badly trying cover his bruised hands when he appeared at the US Open — by using makeup that did not match his skin tone. Trump's hand has led to months of speculations about his health, but White House spin doctors have repeatedly insisted it is not a cause for concern. It has led to rumours he may need IV drips. One X, formerly Twitter, user wrote: "Trump at the 9/11 Pentagon memorial ceremony. Fox News blurred out the back of his right hand which is covered in makeup." Another said: "Just watching Trump at the Pentagon. His mouth is slanted looks very like he had a stroke." Why is the right side of his mouth so droopy." An fourth X-user, tweeting from an account with the name Adam Cochran, commented: "I believe there is growing evidence that the White House is covering up the fact that Donald Trump has been dealing with TIA strokes. "AND that he likely had a more significant ischemic stroke this week." Adam, who describes themself as an "independent investigative journalist", "investor" and "policy consultant", sought to support his claim by pointing to footage of Mr Trump dragging his right leg, his bruised hand and medications listed on the president's annual physical report. Now celebrity psychic and astrologer Inbaal Honigman has given her verdict after reading the president's tarot cards, but suggests it relates to another part of his body. "This card speaks of potential worries around the president's prostate and intestine. As this is quite a positive card, the expectation would be that Trump will receive treatment and recover well."</p>

How can the U.S. government restore public trust regarding unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) through transparency and offering whistleblower protections? Representative Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) is chair of that task force, swearing in witnesses that under oath discussed their experiences and knowledge about UAPs, a rebranded term attached, deserved or not, to unidentified flying objects (UFOs), as well as unidentified objects or phenomena in Earth's bodies of water or space. "Today, I want to state clearly: this is not science fiction or creating speculation. "Future generations will look back on this moment and ask what we did when presented with the unknown. Or did we pursue the truth with courage? A transcript of the hearing and witnesses' prepared testimonies can be read on the U.S. House of Representatives' website. Space.com asked several experts from leading research groups on UAPs/UFOs concerning the hearing and their take-away thoughts. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! "The military witness reports were very good," said Robert Powell, executive board member of the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies in Austin, Texas. While it may not be apparent to the public or congress, Powell said that anyone who has studied the history of the subject knows that there have been hundreds of such reports by military witnesses that are equally as good. "Unless Congress is willing to push for the nitty-gritty details" by obtaining full videos, interviewing pilots involved in UAP incidents, and other reported events, "we will not progress," said Powell. "That's because of their concerns for national security and whether one of our adversaries might learn something from UAP that they could use militarily against us," Powell said. "The resulting tendency to silo all information on UAP prevents moving forward with learning more. Only if Congress allocates funding to the scientific community and academia to study UAP will we make any progress," he concluded. "I find it frustrating that they, rightly, reiterate the importance of the role science can take in figuring out what is behind UAP, but do not apply it in these hearings." Rojas added that he found it also trying that the one organization that has been using science, the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), was pummeled in the hearing, without being represented. "Having worked in the UFO field for so long, I am sympathetic to their [AARO's] effort. They have shown each step of their work analyzing previous videos, and although it is unpopular to demystify some of these reports, their scientific analyses have been sound," he said. "Instead of focusing on real issues and truly championing scientific investigation, the hearing comes across as a very political back-and-forth between the Oversight Committee and the Pentagon," said Rojas. "What gets lost is what we actually need, and that is data gathering and scientific evaluation of that data." "What we need is a robust, transparent effort to analyze what we are collecting, and to build better sensor systems to gather more and better data on UAP," said Rojas. "If extraterrestrials are visiting us, it is not just the military that would be seeing them." Loeb's Galileo Project is an endeavor to bring the search for extraterrestrial technological signatures of other star folk from "accidental or anecdotal observations and legends" to the mainstream of crystal-clear, confirmed and systematic scientific research. But does such a congressional hearing restore public interest in UAP? "Once we all see credible evidence about the nature of UAP, we will be able to get to the bottom of it and everyone would agree on what it means." Scientific evidence is our best path to new knowledge." The simplest way to tell the difference between a dogmatist and a genuine scientist, Loeb said, is to flood both of them with scientific-quality data. "Whereas the dogmatist will shove anomalous data under the carpet of traditional thinking, an open-minded scientist will be thrilled to learn something new with an underlying sense of humility," advised Loeb. "Not only is nature more imaginative than we are, but it also does not care whether we figure it out. The insistence that everything in the sky is either icy rocks or human-made technologies will not rid us of cosmic neighbors, if they exist out there," he concluded. "The hearing hopefully provided more impetus to pass the crucial legislation necessary to answer questions we have about possible US government/contractor involvement with UAP that has been hidden all these years," said Rodeghier. Beyond moving Congress to pass the bills, Rodeghier advised getting witnesses into a SCIF, short for Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. "I'm not sure what can be done with it [those interviews], but having it available is important," said Rodeghier. Another Rodeghier recommendation is to have the head of AARO in a hearing this fall now that he has been on the job for a year. Michael Cifone is the founding executive director of the Society for UAP Studies, based in Los Angeles, California. The group's mission is not to promote a single narrative but to advance careful scholarship, develop educational frameworks, and advocate for standards of evidence and data transparency. That handling of the topic within the government — whose aim since at least after World War II has been increasingly obsessed with national security and maintaining US military and strategic dominance, feels Cifone, "are guiding principles that are ultimately at odds with the inner operating directives of the sciences themselves: free, open, and therefore democratic exploration of self and world." "The UAP problem is not a mystery with one answer, but rather a somewhat unstable and chaotic amalgam of many overlapping realities, complicated by the unfortunate facts of the modern bureaucratic national security state," is a view that Cifone basically endorses. "UAP reports are not a monolith," Cifone advised. Instead, they are a mixed pool consisting of: (1) misidentified U.S. black projects, where cutting-edge aerospace programs are understandably shrouded in secrecy; (2) adversarial drones and surveillance platforms, which represent a genuine national security challenge; (3) a large number of ordinary misperceptions of balloons, satellites, or atmospheric phenomena; and (4) a small but stubborn residue of anomalous cases that resist explanation. The UAP hearing, for all its frustrations, said Cifone, "at least signaled that Congress is beginning to take seriously the structural problems that have long clouded this issue." From a safety standpoint, the "mixture hypothesis" is particularly important, said Cifone. If even a fraction of UAP reports involve advanced adversarial drones or unsafe incursions into U.S. airspace, then society is faced with an aviation and national security challenge that demands systematic response, he said.

"Having worked in the UFO field for so long, I am sympathetic to their [AARO's] effort. They have shown each step of their work analyzing previous videos, and although it is unpopular to demystify some of these reports, their scientific analyses have been sound," he said. "Instead of focusing on real issues and truly championing scientific investigation, the hearing comes across as a very political back-and-forth between the Oversight Committee and the Pentagon," said Rojas. "What gets lost is what we actually need, and that is data gathering and scientific evaluation of that data." "What we need is a robust, transparent effort to analyze what we are collecting, and to build better sensor systems to gather more and better data on UAP," said Rojas. "If extraterrestrials are visiting us, it is not just the military that would be seeing them." Loeb's Galileo Project is an endeavor to bring the search for extraterrestrial technological signatures of other star folk from "accidental or anecdotal observations and legends" to the mainstream of crystal-clear, confirmed and systematic scientific research. But does such a congressional hearing restore public interest in UAP? "Once we all see credible evidence about the nature of UAP, we will be able to get to the bottom of it and everyone would agree on what it means." Scientific evidence is our best path to new knowledge." The simplest way to tell the difference between a dogmatist and a genuine scientist, Loeb said, is to flood both of them with scientific-quality data. "Whereas the dogmatist will shove anomalous data under the carpet of traditional thinking, an open-minded scientist will be thrilled to learn something new with an underlying sense of humility," advised Loeb. "Not only is nature more imaginative than we are, but it also does not care whether we figure it out. The insistence that everything in the sky is either icy rocks or human-made technologies will not rid us of cosmic neighbors, if they exist out there," he concluded. "The hearing hopefully provided more impetus to pass the crucial legislation necessary to answer questions we have about possible US government/contractor involvement with UAP that has been hidden all these years," said Rodeghier. Beyond moving Congress to pass the bills, Rodeghier advised getting witnesses into a SCIF, short for Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. "I'm not sure what can be done with it [those interviews], but having it available is important," said Rodeghier. Another Rodeghier recommendation is to have the head of AARO in a hearing this fall now that he has been on the job for a year. Michael Cifone is the founding executive director of the Society for UAP Studies, based in Los Angeles, California. The group's mission is not to promote a single narrative but to advance careful scholarship, develop educational frameworks, and advocate for standards of evidence and data transparency. That handling of the topic within the government — whose aim since at least after World War II has been increasingly obsessed with national security and maintaining US military and strategic dominance, feels Cifone, "are guiding principles that are ultimately at odds with the inner operating directives of the sciences themselves: free, open, and therefore democratic exploration of self and world." "The UAP problem is not a mystery with one answer, but rather a somewhat unstable and chaotic amalgam of many overlapping realities, complicated by the unfortunate facts of the modern bureaucratic national security state," is a view that Cifone basically endorses. "UAP reports are not a monolith," Cifone advised. Instead, they are a mixed pool consisting of: (1) misidentified U.S. black projects, where cutting-edge aerospace programs are understandably shrouded in secrecy; (2) adversarial drones and surveillance platforms, which represent a genuine national security challenge; (3) a large number of ordinary misperceptions of balloons, satellites, or atmospheric phenomena; and (4) a small but stubborn residue of anomalous cases that resist explanation. The UAP hearing, for all its frustrations, said Cifone, "at least signaled that Congress is beginning to take seriously the structural problems that have long clouded this issue." From a safety standpoint, the "mixture hypothesis" is particularly important, said Cifone. If even a fraction of UAP reports involve advanced adversarial drones or unsafe incursions into U.S. airspace, then society is faced with an aviation and national security challenge that demands systematic response, he said.

How can the U.S. government restore public trust regarding unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) through transparency and offering whistleblower protections? Representative Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) is chair of that task force, swearing in witnesses that under oath discussed their experiences and knowledge about UAPs, a rebranded term attached, deserved or not, to unidentified flying objects (UFOs), as well as unidentified objects or phenomena in Earth's bodies of water or space. "Today, I want to state clearly: this is not science fiction or creating speculation. "Future generations will look back on this moment and ask what we did when presented with the unknown. Or did we pursue the truth with courage? A transcript of the hearing and witnesses' prepared testimonies can be read on the U.S. House of Representatives' website. Space.com asked several experts from leading research groups on UAPs/UFOs concerning the hearing and their take-away thoughts. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! "The military witness reports were very good," said Robert Powell, executive board member of the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies in Austin, Texas. While it may not be apparent to the public or congress, Powell said that anyone who has studied the history of the subject knows that there have been hundreds of such reports by military witnesses that are equally as good. "Unless Congress is willing to push for the nitty-gritty details" by obtaining full videos, interviewing pilots involved in UAP incidents, and other reported events, "we will not progress," said Powell. "That's because of their concerns for national security and whether one of our adversaries might learn something from UAP that they could use militarily against us," Powell said. "The resulting tendency to silo all information on UAP prevents moving forward with learning more. Only if Congress allocates funding to the scientific community and academia to study UAP will we make any progress," he concluded. "I find it frustrating that they, rightly, reiterate the importance of the role science can take in figuring out what is behind UAP, but do not apply it in these hearings." Rojas added that he found it also trying that the one organization that has been using science, the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), was pummeled in the hearing, without being represented.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>False claims, conspiracy theories and posts naming people with no connection to the incident spread rapidly across social media in the aftermath of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing on Wednesday, some amplified and fueled by AI tools. CBS News identified 10 posts by Grok, X's AI chatbot, that misidentified the suspect before his identity, now known to be southern Utah resident Tyler Robinson, was released. Grok eventually generated a response saying it had incorrectly identified the suspect, but by then, posts featuring the wrong person's face and name were already circulating across X. One such photo was reposted by the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Utah, which later posted an update saying, "this appears to be an AI enhanced photo" that distorted the clothing and facial features. One AI-enhanced image portrayed a man appearing much older than Robinson, who is 22. An AI-generated video that smoothed out the suspect's features and jumbled his shirt design was posted by an X user with more than 2 million followers and was reposted thousands of times. Spencer Cox announced that the suspect in custody was Robinson, Grok's replies to X users' inquiries about him were contradictory. Voter registration records indicate Robinson is not affiliated with a political party. CBS News also identified a dozen instances where Grok said that Kirk was alive the day following his death. Other Grok responses gave a false assassination date, labeled the FBI's reward offer a "hoax" and said that reports about Kirk's death "remain conflicting" even after his death had been confirmed. Most generative AI tools produce results based on probability, which can make it challenging for them to provide accurate information in real time as events unfold, S. Shyam Sundar, a professor at Penn State University and the director of the university's Center for Socially Responsible Artificial Intelligence, told CBS News. It's more based on the likelihood of this event occurring, and if there's enough out there that might question his death, it might pick up on some of that." X did not respond to a request for comment about the false information Grok was posting. Perplexity's spokesperson told CBS News that "accurate AI is the core technology we are building and central to the experience in all of our products," but that "Perplexity never claims to be 100% accurate." "The vast majority of the queries seeking information on this topic return high quality and accurate responses," a Google spokesperson told CBS News. Sundar told CBS News that people tend to perceive AI as being less biased or more reliable than someone online who they don't know. "If it's just a social media friend or some somebody on the contact list that's sent something on your feed with unknown pedigree ... chances are people trust the machine more than they do the random human." Misinformation may also be coming from foreign sources, according to Cox, Utah's governor, who said in a press briefing on Thursday that foreign adversaries including Russia and China have bots that "are trying to instill disinformation and encourage violence." Cox urged listeners to spend less time on social media. "I would encourage you to ignore those and turn off those streams, and to spend a little more time with our families," he said.
