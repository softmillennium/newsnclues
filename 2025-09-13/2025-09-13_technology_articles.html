                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rainmaker Technology's bid to deploy cloud-seeding flares on small drones is being met by resistance from the airline pilots union, which has urged the Federal Aviation Administration to consider denying the startup's request unless it meets stricter safety guidelines. The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) told the FAA that Rainmaker's petition “fails to demonstrate an equivalent level of safety” and poses “an extreme safety risk.” In its filing, Rainmaker proposed using two flare types, one “burn-in-place” and the other ejectable, on its Elijah quadcopter, to disperse particles that stimulate precipitation. Elijah has a maximum altitude of 15,000 feet MSL (measured from sea level), which sits inside controlled airspace where commercial airliners routinely fly. Drones need permission from Air Traffic Control to fly inside this bubble. Rainmaker's petition says it will operate in Class G (uncontrolled) airspace unless otherwise authorized. “Regarding their objection to the use of flares, independent bodies like this administration's EPA and multiple state departments of natural resources have studied the dispersion and environmental safety of materials used in cloud seeding for over 70 years and never found any adverse effect from cloud seeding,” Doricko said. “Our use of flares in unmanned systems is solely for research purposes in a controlled flying environment and is not a part of our larger ongoing operations,” Kim added. Doricko said that a typical Rainmaker operation disperses 50-100 grams of silver iodide, and far less than that in a flight with flares, while one hour of flight of a commercial plane releases kilograms of uncombusted volatile organics, sulfur oxides, and soot – significantly more material than a Rainmaker op. “Rainmaker is interested in doing the best, responsible atmospheric research and is thus comparing flares to our proprietary aerosol dispersion system that will replace flares and exclusively emit silver iodide. ALPA's objection to this exemplifies their limited understanding of our CONOP, all of which contains extensive risk mitigations in the non-public docs that the FAA is reviewing now,” Doricko said. “Regarding ALPA's concerns about coordination with aviation authorities and airspace, our flight operations consist of broadcasting signals, intentional coordination with local ATC, certified pilots, and a collision avoidance system that involves electronic and physical observers,” he said. However, Rainmaker says the flights will occur over rural areas and over properties owned by private landlords “with whom Rainmaker has developed close working relationships.” By spraying small particles into certain clouds, scientists found they could induce precipitation. When a silver iodide particle bumps into droplets of water that are super-cooled, they cause the droplet to rapidly freeze because its water is already below the freezing point. Once the ice crystal forms, it can grow quickly if conditions are right, faster than a liquid water droplet would in similar circumstances. Plus, the rapid growth helps the crystals stick around longer than a water droplet, which might evaporate before it has a chance to fall as precipitation. Rainmaker's twist — doing this work with drones instead of pilots — could prove safer in the longer term. The company points out that the flight profiles are tightly bounded, overseen by a remote pilot and trained crews, over rural areas, with other safety checks in place. What happens next hinges on whether the FAA thinks those mitigations are sufficient. 9/13/2025: The story has been updated to include Rainmaker's comments from Augustus Doricko, founder and CEO, and Sam Kim, Rainmaker's aviation regulatory manager.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you work for Opendoor, the online real estate platform, you might consider polishing up your resume. During a recent appearance on CNBC's “Squawk on the Street,” Keith Rabois, a former member of the PayPal Mafia, told a reporter that he felt that the majority of the people at his company were expendable. We don't need more than 200 of them,” Rabois remarked. He added that “the advent of AI and other technologies” made the workforce reduction a “simple problem” to solve. Rabois' apparent disinterest in maintaining a majority of Opendoor's workforce is somewhat humorous given how well the company's been doing lately. Indeed, the company's stock is up 500 percent this year. That said, the stock performance appears to largely be the result of a wave of retail investors becoming interested in the firm due to online advice spread by a hedge fund manager. It's unclear whether Rabois's ruthless comment was just an effort to inspire confidence in the profitability of the company. The stock soared this week, but other developments also helped buoy investor confidence—namely, the appointment of former Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO. CNBC notes that “investor” pressure had spurred the exit of former Opendoor CEO Carrie Wheeler. On Thursday, the company's stock rose a whopping 78 percent, before dipping down 13 percent on Friday, the outlet notes. This company was founded on the principle of innovation and working together in person. Rabois also took the opportunity to dunk on the company's diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, noting that, under its previous leadership, the firm had gone “down this DEI path,” and that Rabois intended to “fix all that.” Gizmodo reached out to Opendoor for more information about its apparent plan to upend its workforce.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Chinese censorship sprang a major leak on September 11, when researchers confirmed that more than 500GB of internal documents, source code, work logs, and internal communications from the so-called Great Firewall were dumped online, including packaging repos and operational runbooks used to build and maintain China's national traffic filtering system. Contained in the leak are what appear to be full build systems for deep packet inspection platforms, as well as code modules that reference the identification and throttling of specific circumvention tools. Much of the stack is geared toward DPI-based VPN detection, SSL fingerprinting, and full-session logging. They describe it as a turnkey “Great Firewall in a box,” with initial deployments reportedly built on HP and Dell servers before shifting to Chinese-sourced hardware in response to sanctions. A leaked deployment sheet reveals that the system was rolled out across 26 data centers in Myanmar, with live dashboards monitoring 81 million simultaneous TCP connections. The system was reportedly operated by Myanmar's state-run telecoms company and integrated into core Internet exchange points, thereby enabling mass blocking and selective filtering. Partner reporting from WIRED and Amnesty International reveals that Geedge's DPI infrastructure has been exported to other states — Pakistan, Ethiopia, and Kazakhstan being among the recipients — where it's often used alongside lawful intercept platforms. In Pakistan, Geedge's equipment allegedly forms part of a larger system known as WMS 2.0, which is capable of conducting blanket surveillance on mobile networks in real-time. WIRED's reporting also describes how the leaked documents show Geedge's system can intercept unencrypted HTTP sessions. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. So far, researchers have only just begun to comb through the source-code archive, which remains under-evaluated mainly. However, analysts argue that the presence of build logs and dev notes could help identify protocol-level weaknesses or operational missteps that censorship circumvention tools may exploit. The entire archive is now mirrored by Enlace Hacktivista and others, with researchers urging caution for anyone downloading or examining it.

My computer engineering professors also emphasized user centered design. For one of Google's top scientists to bring this up is an admission that they won't, or can't, design a good user experience for their tools. Large organizations are especially poor at user-friendly design because the underlying structures which support that goal don't exist. Organizational science is still in its infancy. Everything you see of its character, including emphasizing tests and practice, follows from that. Talking about good UX is miles away. I mean, we had five years of English classes in high school, and by the end of high school, less than five out of 30 people in my cohort were able to string a couple of sentences together in English. And my class was made up of serious, studious young people. The issue with "learning to learn" is that it does not include the foundational skill of "how to communicate". This difficulty is then compounded by self conversation bias that negatively spins against the person seeking. That is two very high hurdles: negative self bias, and inarticulate communications while seeking guidance. It always surprises and saddens me that, despite having been an excellent student throughout my years of education, I remember practically nothing about 90% of the subjects I studied. I did not find it to be true almost at all, and I tested many other people on it. When I voiced my concerns, the usual answer was, "Yes, but when you pick up a book, you will remember". And then I asked, "Try it", and the subsequent answer was, "I have to admit you are right".The "re-absorption speed" is heavily confounded by general IQ and the kind of cognitive stimulation one receives in daily life, but the original learnings are mostly gone. This has been the case for literally my entire career and I assume most of the professional world for the last half century.Technology is continually reshaping industries and while many eschew learning and adopting, those who embrace it are the ones who succeed best IME.

I said it already in a reply to GP, but I'm going to say it again: I stopped caring about what people list on their resumes, your work history and education don't matter to me. I'd rather hire a hungry junior that finished a bootcamp, that has a drive and ability to absorb new things and adapt to changing environments, over somebody who's got 10 years of experience and can't do shit outside of their comfort zone.The number of people who aren't able to learn and adapt to changing times, new tools, new ways of working, etc. The number of people who aren't able to learn and adapt to changing times, new tools, new ways of working, etc. I can teach somebody who finished a 6-month coding bootcamp Go, all the internal tooling, go over the business with them, etc. if they have these skills and end up with a productive mid-level engineer who gets shit done in a few years. What I can't teach is the drive and ability to learn, that's a much longer process and if you don't already have it then I'm not prepared to develop it.Hell, outside of looking for signs of obvious bullshit I stopped giving a shit about resumes. Every single time I have hired somebody who has 5 years of "experience" working with technologies I bullet pointed on a JD they ended up fumbling the moment they had to do something new. Doing leetcode, pair programming sessions, take-home assignments, whiteboarding system designs, etc. for SWE positions did nothing to really improve this; for SRE/DevOps roles I tried trivia questions (how are containers implemented - like what kernel technologies do they use and what do they do, how would you go about investigating why a service is consuming 100% CPU time), throwing them at broken VM's and more take-home assignments.AI tools only make this skillset more important - I can throw Junie, Claude Code, or Copilot and small task and end up with...an implementation. But they still fuck up, constantly, and yet again, anything that's not already been done, regularly, requires a lot of guidance from an engineer in the loop. And with the god damned death of the web thanks to AI slop being posted anywhere, the ability to find answers and reason through problems is only going to become more important when these tools fail miserably for the third time in a row.

Often times they will revert back to rote memorization, highlighting, re-reading, copying notes, cramming, etc rather than use the things they are learning about learning to learn the subject of learning itself.I think you have to start with:1) Teaching learning in the first place.

If we're lucky, LLMs force people to put more effort into assignments and grading and then that would help kids learn to learn as well. There's also the fact that kids are being taught the very basics, the sorts of things increasingly intelligent models are most likely to be able to solve first. I don't think there's any level of effort that can be put into designing assignments to get around this.Similar to how teachers haven't really been able to do anything to stop kids from sticking their algebra problems into wolframalpha or other tools besides just making them do the work in class (which then cuts into teaching time).Beyond a certain point, all that can be done is for teachers to try to instill the importance of practice into students, and for parents to be more proactive in monitoring how their kid is doing their homework.Maybe we'll see an increase in after-school classes for kids to do homework in, under teacher supervision.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox. Billionaire Elon Musk is taking issue with a recent investigation by the Houston Chronicle and The Texas Newsroom that raised questions about a flood tunnel project he's pitching to address Houston's chronic flooding woes. But experts said his response, which he did not explain to the newsrooms, isn't supported by facts or data. Last month, the newsrooms reported that Musk's tunneling company, The Boring Co., has been lobbying elected officials for months to allow it to build tunnels under Houston for flood mitigation. Boring has proposed digging two 12-foot-wide tunnels beneath Buffalo Bayou — the main waterway running through central Houston — to carry stormwater out of neighborhoods and toward the Gulf of Mexico during major storms. Musk and representatives with Boring did not respond to interview requests or answer questions the newsrooms sent in advance of last month's story about whether Boring's smaller tunnels would be able to handle the scale of floodwater Houston is likely to encounter in the future. Instead, Musk waited until hours after the story published to post a response on X, the social media company he's owned since 2022. “Boring Company tunnels will work and cost <10% of alternatives,” his Aug. 28 post read. “If more flow is needed, additional tunnels can be built and furthermore they can be route water from many parts of the city, not just one.” The post was written in response to a post on X from U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt, a Houston Republican who helped arrange private meetings with government officials in Harris County and across the state to sell them on Boring's flood tunnel plan. “A lifelong Houstonian and Texas Congressman spoke to the smartest man on planet earth about solving a generational flooding issue in our city that no one else will fix,” Hunt wrote. Musk's post offered no data or engineering explanation to back up his assertions. So the newsrooms examined his statements, comparing them against flood studies, and interviewed engineering experts, some of whom pointed out key technical and logistical challenges with the Boring plan. One of Musk's claims is likely false, and the others are not yet possible to verify with certainty, according to the newsrooms' examination. But that's partly because the two are strikingly different proposals. Hunt's team has said Boring's Buffalo Bayou project would cost $760 million, according to internal communications obtained by the newsrooms through public records requests. But based on the figures available, Boring's proposal would cost closer to one-sixth of the county's estimate — not less than 10%, as Musk's post suggested. Two 12-foot tunnels would provide less than one-fifth of the volume that a single 40-foot tunnel offers. That means they would divert less water from vulnerable areas than one large tunnel. Jim Blackburn, a Houston environmental lawyer and flood policy expert, said while Musk's company deserves a fair hearing, cheaper does not automatically mean better. Emily Woodell, a spokesperson for the Harris County Flood Control District, said the agency needs more information before it can weigh in on any of Musk's claims. “We'd have to do a lot of study before anything could even potentially move forward, so I wouldn't want to speculate,” she said. Larry Dunbar, a veteran water resources engineer who has advised Houston-area governmental agencies on drainage issues, said based on size alone, it would take about 11 of Boring's tunnels to carry the same amount of water as one large tunnel. Lined up side by side, with enough room between them to keep the ground stable, the full system could span hundreds of feet. Harris County Commissioner Tom Ramsey, who has an engineering background, agreed. “It would not be simple to just add additional tunnels later,” Ramsey said. John Blount, a former Harris County engineer who retired after more than three decades with the county, similarly dismissed Musk's suggestion that Boring could just build more tunnels if the initial plan falls short. While working on other infrastructure projects, Blount said, he has come across a number of contractors capable of building tunnels large enough to handle the job properly the first time. “You don't start small and figure it out later,” he said. Musk argued that Boring's tunnels could be used in different parts of the city, not just along Buffalo Bayou. Some local officials agreed that Musk's tunnels might actually work better for smaller watersheds that do not take on as much water as Buffalo Bayou. Ramsey said he supports exploring smaller tunnels for areas like Hunting and Halls bayous, which run through other parts of the city and also need resources to strengthen their flood protection. The county commissioner publicly called for a closer look at narrower tunnels during a commissioners court meeting in April, after Hunt had pitched him on Boring's proposal in February. “It's another tool in our toolbox to help mitigate flooding. And certainly with what's happening in the Hill Country,” Ramsey said, referring to recent deadly floods in Central Texas, “and what continues to happen in Harris County, we need as many tools as we can possibly get.” However, she said smaller tunnels could be a viable solution in certain areas. Since that idea had not been a focus of research, she added, more study would be needed before any such project could move forward. Colleen Gilbert, executive director of the Greens Bayou Coalition — a nonprofit that works to protect neighborhoods near Greens Bayou, in northeast Houston — said communities in her watershed are desperate for relief as well. They would welcome the massive storm tunnel once proposed by Harris County, she said, but even smaller tunnels would be better than nothing. “We would be thrilled to have any and all possibilities looked at,” Gilbert said. Experts and officials the newsrooms interviewed, however, still took issue with Musk's sweeping statement that “Boring Company tunnels will work” because it doesn't take into account complexities of the project or that success largely depends on what kind of system the county ultimately wants. In a two-page memo Boring sent to Hunt's team in February and that was circulated among local officials in the county, the company framed the pitch as an “innovative, cost-effective solution” to Houston's chronic flooding. “We are confident in our ability to execute this project successfully,” wrote Jim Fitzgerald, Boring's global head of business development. But if the goal is to shield lives and property from another Hurricane Harvey-level flooding event, he believes the smaller-scale project simply does not measure up. Rock Owens, retired Harris County attorney for environmental affairs who represented agencies including the flood control district, said he has seen local officials repeatedly greenlighting massive projects that were not well thought out and led to costly legal battles. He pointed, for instance, to flood control issues along White Oak Bayou in northwest Houston. But Owens said even unsuccessful lawsuits are costly and the kind of challenge that could have exposed the county to a substantial damages award. Musk's ethos of moving fast and worrying about consequences later, Owens said, only heightens the risk. Yilun Cheng is an investigative reporter with the Houston Chronicle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Aviation Administration announced it's proposing $3.1 million in fines against Boeing for safety violations in late 2023 and early 2024, according to a press release from the government agency on Friday. The safety violations include an incident on January 5, 2024, when a door plug fell out of an Alaska Airlines flight traveling from Portland, Oregon. Boeing struck a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice earlier this year to avoid criminal charges in those crashes. The FAA also notes that a Boeing employee pressured a member of the FAA's Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) to sign off on a Boeing 737-MAX plane so that the plane manufacturer could meet its delivery schedule. The FAA identified hundreds of quality system violations at Boeing's 737 factory in Renton, Washington, and Boeing subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems' 737 factory in Wichita, Kansas. Reached for comment over email, a Boeing spokesperson said the company regrets the door-plug accident and continues to work on “strengthening our safety culture and improving first-time quality and accountability across our operations.” “Our team continues to implement these improvements, such as investing in workforce training, strengthening production system compliance and encouraging employees to speak up.” The agency didn't respond to questions emailed Friday evening.

Wait a second, what happens to human executive coaches in the world of AI? Mark answers that question by pointing out that while coaching apps already exist, the accountability of looking another person in the eye is something AI can't replace. Consolidating them into one platform lets AI summarize, connect ideas, and extract insights you'd never find on your own. Ask AI the “most obvious objection”: Before you send a proposal or share an idea, have AI tell you what the pushback will be. Mark uses this trick to see blind spots and strengthen his work before others point them out. Related: Leverage the true value of meetings with AI by building an ‘LLM for Leadership' Mark does this with six months of his client notes in Notion to find “key areas of growth” and has even asked his AI to summarize his entire year of work to identify opportunities for the next year. Challenge your team to rewrite their job descriptions: Instead of just encouraging general learning, give your team a specific mission: find AI tools to automate the tedious parts of their jobs so they can focus on work that requires uniquely human skills.

My computer engineering professors also emphasized user centered design. For one of Google's top scientists to bring this up is an admission that they won't, or can't, design a good user experience for their tools. It always surprises and saddens me that, despite having been an excellent student throughout my years of education, I remember practically nothing about 90% of the subjects I studied. Large organizations are especially poor at user-friendly design because the underlying structures which support that goal don't exist. Organizational science is still in its infancy. Everything you see of its character, including emphasizing tests and practice, follows from that.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hike, once one of India's most valuable startups with unicorn status, has become the latest casualty of New Delhi's recent real-money gaming ban, with the company — led by Kavin Bharti Mittal, son of Airtel founder Sunil Bharti Mittal — now shutting down. On Saturday, Hike founder Mittal (pictured above) said that the startup's U.S. business, which launched nine months ago, was “off to a strong start.” But he said scaling it globally would require “a full recap, a reset that is not the best use of capital or time.” Initially launched as an instant messaging app rivaling WhatsApp in 2012, Hike pivoted to real-money gaming in recent years, with its primary platform, Rush, offering casual games like carrom and ludo for cash prizes, following the shutdown of Hike Messenger in 2021. Storied investors including Tiger Global, SoftBank, and Tencent backed Hike's early ambition to take on WhatsApp with a youth-focused messaging app. “For the first time in 13 years, my answer is no. The federal government said the decision was aimed at addressing incidents of harm, including cases where individuals reportedly died by suicide after losing money in these games. While some started pivoting to new ventures like micro-dramas and financial services, others began exploring international markets to keep parts of their gaming businesses alive. The crackdown has also triggered a wave of layoffs, with around 2,000 job losses reported across companies like Games24x7, Head Digital Works, MPL, and Zupee. Some VC firms backing these startups have also questioned their founders on whether there had been any early signs of regulatory action — and if so, why no steps were taken to mitigate the impact, sources familiar with the conversations told TechCrunch. But I choose to look on the bright side: the learnings are invaluable, and my conviction for what's next is even stronger,” Mittal wrote.

Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Portable monitors have long occupied a niche market of small, lightweight displays that usually sacrifice features and performance on the altar of convenience. Still, it would be nice to have something of decent size to game on, maybe as a second screen for that giga-hauler gaming laptop weighing down your tech bag. Asus attempts to fill that role with its ZenScreen MB27ACF. However, it still weighs just 6.57 pounds and is 20mm thin. The panel is IPS with QHD 2560x1440 resolution, 100 Hz, FreeSync/VRR, and three internal speakers. It includes an integrated fold-out stand and a nice C-clamp arm for the desktop. The MB27ACF isn't strictly a gaming monitor; it gives you most of what's needed for decent play. The 100 Hz refresh rate is relatively low, but coupled with a decent overdrive, it delivers reasonably smooth motion processing with just moderate input lag. It includes Adaptive-Sync but only for FreeSync and VRR applications. It is not certified for G-Sync, and I was unable to use Nvidia's frame-tear-eliminating tech. However, it works fine with Radeon video cards and consoles. The image comes from an IPS panel with QHD 2560x1440 resolution. That's 109ppi in pixel density speak, enough for a nice, sharp image at close viewing distances. I also found decent off-axis quality and good reflection rejection from the screen's matte finish. The color gamut is slightly larger than sRGB; I refer to it as sRGB+. Ergonomically, the package is more complete than other portables I've encountered. There's no carrying case included, but you do get a metal fold-out stand with rubber feet to keep it from sliding around. You can quickly install it on any desk or tabletop up to around four inches thick. Should you want an aftermarket solution, there's a 75mm VESA mount. For power, you get a small external brick, or you can connect the MB27ACF via USB-C for a one-cable solution. Asus offers a solid package here for $449 at this writing. It sits in the middle between premium and budget pricing, but from what I've seen in this sparsely populated genre, the MB27ACF has no real competition. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The panel can be used without any extras, including the power supply, if you plug it into a PC or laptop equipped with USB-C. The fold-out stand has a large angle range and includes rubber feet in just the right spots to keep everything from sliding about. The arm ends in a large C-clamp with around four inches of range. A small snap-on adaptor interfaces with the arm's Z mount. HDMI and USB-C cables round out the parts bundle. Like the fold-out stand, it is also rubberized for added stability. The arm is super nice and could easily cost $100 on its own. It has a large clamp with rubber pads that protect your furniture from scratches. The panel snaps onto it using a small, round bracket, which is removable. The Z mount offers almost unlimited swivel plus fore and aft movement. The height adjustment is nearly seven inches and features a locking mechanism. You also get a DC plug for the small external power brick. If you power the MB27ACF through USB-C, brightness is limited to 85 nits. On the opposite side are control keys for power and menu navigation. Pressing one of the MB27ACF's side control keys opens a small menu with brightness, OSD, and power options. There are eight picture modes, and I was surprised to see no Racing mode. The Image menu has luminance sliders and a five-level overdrive called Trace Free. In case you were fuzzy on the MB27ACF's gaming intent, Asus has thrown in its complete GamePlus suite with six aiming points, timers, frame counter, stopwatch, and display alignment marks. I wish they'd thrown in G-Sync too, but users of consoles and Radeon cards will get Adaptive-Sync/VRR through the full 100 Hz refresh rate range. From Asus' ProArt side comes QuickFit, which is a handy set of on-screen templates for different paper sizes. It's ideal for visualizing documents that you plan to print since they can be viewed at actual size. The MB27ACF doesn't require calibration in its Standard picture mode, but I went for a grayscale adjustment anyway. The RGB sliders got me dialed in easily with a visible and measurable improvement. Gamma is spot-on whether you calibrate or not, and I was glad to see accurate presets included. Unfortunately, HDR is not supported, so there's nothing to report in that regard. The MB27ACF impressed me unexpectedly with its gaming ability. But Asus makes excellent use of every Hertz with a superb overdrive that is precisely tuned. Locking the frame rate at 100fps in QHD resolution is easy work for many video cards so the lack of G-Sync for me wasn't an issue. I could dispatch targets with very little wasted ammo. Input lag is low enough that I didn't perceive it. A 144 Hz monitor with less precise overdrive would not look this good. Color and contrast were good but after enjoying HDR and wide gamut color on other monitors, the MB27ACF came up a tad short. Warm tones show better than cooler textures which were a bit flat. If you're trooping around a forest or jungle, the image has more impact than the icy cold environments of Doom Eternal's first horde map. For casual gaming on the go, there is little to complain about. And the draw of a 27-inch monitor cannot be ignored. I would recommend using a bag or sleeve to protect the screen. However, the fold-out stand is extremely well-engineered, with firm movement. I also used the included arm, which clamps down in just a minute. Snapping the panel on creates a solid package with precise adjustment. And the Z mount allows for nearly unlimited swivel. The MB27ACF boasts its 2.1-channel sound with subwoofer, and indeed, I heard more bass than what comes from typical integrated speakers. Though it lacks HDR and wide gamut color, it games very well and comes with multiple mounting options that are well thought out. Christian Eberle is a Contributing Editor for Tom's Hardware US.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center — an organization responsible for discoveries that have fundamentally transformed cancer treatment and helped to establish the Seattle area as a biotech hub — is celebrating its founding 50 years ago this month. Appelbaum, a Fred Hutch oncologist and executive vice president, recalls the early, scrappier days of the nonprofit as it was trying to turn Dr. Donnall Thomas' bold ideas about bone marrow transplants into viable treatments. The effort ultimately worked and Fred Hutch is now a 6,000-employee institution that draws on its origins to inspire the next generation of ambitious cancer research. “That history of success tells us that we did it before, and we should be able to do it again,” Appelbaum told GeekWire. Added Dr. Robert Vonderheide, director of the Abramson Cancer Center at Penn Medicine, regarding Fred Hutch: “Its reputation and impact are so well-known and cherished that everyone in our field simply says ‘The Hutch.' But even as past accomplishments and recent breakthroughs are driving momentum, Fred Hutch faces daunting new challenges. Fred Hutch president and director Dr. Tom Lynch warned earlier this year that the administration's cuts to overhead support “would have a chilling, dramatic, horrific effect on our ability to do research.” Appelbaum struck a tone of resiliency this month, noting that Fred Hutch has survived three recessions and significant funding cuts — and the founding years themselves were a test of the researchers' mettle. In 1990, Thomas won a Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on bone marrow transplants, but the initial experiments were often harrowing for the doctors, nurses and leukemia patients alike. “[T]ime and again you'd have patients come in with hopes that they could be saved, and their family hoped that they could be saved, and unfortunately the toxicity of the transplant caused them to die or the disease came back,” he said in a 2015 interview. “They'd been brought back literally from the jaws of death.” From there, the researchers made additional discoveries, realizing that bone marrow transplants could treat certain genetic ailments, such as sickle cell disease. Fred Hutch studies helped spur CAR-T cell treatments by demonstrating the ability to genetically manipulate immune cells and create receptors that recognize malignant cancers. Fred Hutch scientists and clinicians have made essential discoveries “in diverse topics from tumor immunology to cancer virology to bone marrow transplantation,” said Sharpless, who is now professor of Cancer Policy and Innovation at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. “It would not be an exaggeration,” he added, “to say that many thousands of people who were once diagnosed with cancer are alive today because of critical discoveries at the FHCC.” With these gains, is the moonshot of curing cancer getting closer? “We are curing lots of cancers.” Appelbaum said, while acknowledging that some, such as pancreatic cancer and glioblastomas, remain difficult to treat. When it comes to those diseases, he added, “I firmly believe that we will, over the next decade, continue to unravel all the reasons why our current therapies, which should work, don't work.” But the Trump administration has proposed capping indirect cost payments at 15%, far below Fred Hutch's current 76% rate. That change would wipe out roughly $125 million in annual support for the center, whose operating budget was $2.1 billion last year. Appelbaum acknowledged that U.S. research institutions could make fiscal improvements, but the nonprofit is worried. The center has made layoffs, but declined to confirm how many. Fred Hutch also has support from philanthropic giving, which includes $710 million from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his family that's being issued over a decade, and a gift from Stuart and Molly Sloan, owners of University Village, that was recently increased to $100 million. Despite funding uncertainties, Appelbaum still can imagine how cancer care hits its moonshot.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whichever you choose, the combined CPU and GPU cooling capacity is claimed to be 250W. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Listed on China's Taobao online market (h/t FanlessTech), what makes this particular design remarkable is that an all-copper edition is being made available, limited to 10 units. Whether you opt for the majority copper or aluminum shrouded version, you will receive a 360 x 303 x 130mm case with an interior volume of 14.2 liters and an essentially copper passive cooling system inside. As per the headline, this is an ITX form factor chassis. Thus, you can equip your own choice of 170 x 170mm ITX motherboard in this quick-release system case. A half-height Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 is reportedly the most powerful option that works in this machine. That will likely contribute approximately 145W or less to the thermal budget. However, we can't be sure whether you can split that total 250W TDP budget however you like between the CPU and GPU. That's because, upon reading through the (machine-translated) specs, it appears that two separate thermal solutions are addressing these hot components. The blurb suggests that there are “a total of seventeen 8mm heat pipes to provide heat conduction for the CPU.” Meanwhile, the GPU is cooled by a trio of vapor chambers linked to a 10mm heat pipe. Both parts are also connected to the “four-sided heat dissipation structure,” which is hewn from copper fins, providing an effective 1.3 m² heat dissipation area, according to the case maker. On the Taobao retail page, we see that the aluminum shell version of this case is priced at 1,760 Chinese Yuan (~$250) for an introductory period, rising to 2,000 Yuan (~$280) upon general availability. Also, you'd need to hire an agent or use some other jiggery-pokery to purchase it for delivery outside of China. We couldn't find any price/availability details for the limited-edition all-copper version. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Now, thanks to the power of modern computers and the dramatic price drop, 4K monitors are no longer unattainable upgrades. But for my money, this is the best monitor the average person working from home should buy—especially when it's on discount. The “Ash White” color looks clean on my already-white desk. It might not look as professional as a silver or black model, but for home use, I prefer the white. The design is worth noting, too, since at this price, some monitors tend to look really cheap. Setting up this monitor is simple, with no tools required. Compared to most monitors, it does have an extra backplate that must be tightened into the stand (with a thumb screw), but it only takes a minute or so to pull the various pieces out of the box and have it ready to go. The back of the monitor has a standard VESA mount, making it perfect for connecting to a monitor arm if that's your jam. The stand gives you a full range of adjustments, including 5 inches of height, tilt, rotation, and swivel. Unfortunately, it doesn't go high enough to rotate it completely into a vertical monitor, which is a shame. (You can still use it vertically with a monitor arm.)

The lack of USB-C is annoying, as so many laptops these days ship without HDMI. If you have a MacBook Air, Dell XPS 13, Surface Laptop, or countless other laptops with limited ports, you'll be stuck using a USB hub or docking station to get them connected to this monitor. The lack of USB means you'll need to plug things like extra storage, your mouse, keyboard, or other accessories directly into your laptop or into a dock. Clearly, this is an area in which Dell compromised to get the price down. Fortunately, Dell sells the same monitor with an integrated USB-C hub, the S2725QC model, for just $50 more. If you'd rather have those ports over the resolution, Dell even sells a QHD (2K) model (2,560 x 1,440) for $245 with a built-in USB-C hub. A lot of people, especially on a desktop PC, may not need those extra ports anyway, so I like that Dell offers the option and doesn't charge outrageous prices to upgrade. You'll pay more than $100 for it, but it's one area where the Samsung 27" ViewFinity S8 has an advantage, with USB-C connectivity and more. It even comes with a KVM switch to sweeten the deal. I haven't tested that monitor myself yet, but it's on my list for that reason alone. The Dell 27 Plus has a 3,840 x 2,160 resolution, otherwise known as 4K or UHD. You definitely can't pick out pixels. It's an IPS (in-plane switching) panel, which is also standard for a work monitor of this type. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. IPS won't have the deep blacks and HDR capability of OLED (or Mini-LED), or even the improved contrast in newer IPS Black panels, like the Dell UltraSharp 32 4K U3225Q. However, the monitor goes up to 355 nits and has a contrast of 1,270:1, according to my own measurements. With quite good color accuracy as well (an average color accuracy of 1.16), it's even a decent option for content creators looking for an affordable display to match with a MacBook Pro. The Dell 27 Plus 4K does have a matte coating, which I don't prefer. It's still fairly unusual to find glossy panels, outside of OLED monitors or the Apple Studio Display (9/10, WIRED Recommends), which is 40 percent brighter than this monitor. I'll always take the crystal-clear look of a glossy display, even if it means having to deal with glare from time to time. The matte finish isn't too noticeable, but it does make the display feel slightly dimmer and less vibrant. Thanks to the 120-Hz refresh rate and AMD FreeSync Premium, the Dell 27 Plus 4K is even a decent little gaming monitor when you need it to be. No, it's not going to compete with a dedicated gaming monitor, especially one that is QHD with a 240-Hz refresh rate, for example. But if you need 4K for work, the Dell 27 Plus 4K functions well as a hybrid gaming-and-work monitor. I happily tried a few different games, including Cyberpunk 2077, Marvel Rivals, and Star Wars Outlaws. The high resolution is better-suited for slower, single-player experiences, but you can pull it down to lower resolutions and enjoy some faster-paced games with the 120-Hz refresh rate. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. That higher refresh rate isn't just for gaming, though. Dell has been among the first to introduce 120-Hz refresh rates across the board in its mainstream consumer monitors. It makes for a much smoother experience in nearly everything you do, from scrolling a webpage to even just moving the cursor. It goes a long way toward making even this affordable monitor feel premium. For internal monitor speakers, I found myself enjoying the experience. The speakers really do elevate the gaming experience, and I even found myself listening to music casually with them. (You should probably still snag some computer speakers.) The closest thing Lenovo and HP have is at least hundreds of dollars more. LG and Samsung come close with their options, but their 4K 27-inch monitors only have a 60-Hz refresh rate. If the port situation is a problem for you, which I can fully understand, I'd recommend checking out the S2725QC model. But if you've been working from home on a crusty old 1080p monitor for too long, the Dell 27 Plus 4K is the 4K upgrade you've been waiting for.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Google has accidentally leaked its new Nest security cameras and video doorbell line. Setup options appeared in the Google Home app for wired versions of the Nest Cam Indoor (3rd gen), Nest Cam Outdoor (2nd gen), and Nest Doorbell (3rd gen), as reported by Android Authority. The options now appear to have been removed, but an eagle-eyed Redditor also found the new products locked up at Home Depot, ready to go on sale. That's likely when we'll see the new hardware, too. There's also talk of a new subscription option as Nest Aware turns into Google Home Premium, and a new Google Home Premium Advanced plan. There was also a raft of performance improvements and some much-needed polish. Sony stopped selling its flagship Xperia phones in the US last year, and that seems to be continuing with the latest midrange Xperia 10 VII, announced on Friday. It'll launch in Asia, Europe, and the UK, and it debuts a fresh design language with a horizontal camera bar, much like Google's Pixel phones (and even the iPhone Air). Still, you get a 120-Hz refresh rate, and some folks will be excited to see the 3.5-mm headphone jack and microSD card slot. It's powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chip with a 5,000-mAh battery in tow, and no wireless charging. Here's more you may have missed this week: This week, Qualcomm announced the next evolution of its fast-charging technology, known as Quick Charge 5+. Qualcomm calls it its “fastest and most versatile charging solution,” which can recharge phones from 0 to 50 percent in five minutes. For example, Quick Charge 5+ doesn't just flow all that juice to the device uninhibited; instead, it “dynamically” regulates that power using a “reduced-voltage approach.” This means it can lower the voltage on the fly to prevent overheating while charging, without impacting performance or battery health. Qualcomm says its fast-charging technology powers over 1 billion devices, but we'll have to see if Quick Charge 5+ picks up more mainstream adoption in phones and accessories in the US. Qualcomm's annual Snapdragon Summit is coming up on September 23, and the company says devices announced at the conference will support Quick Charge 5+. Smart-lock brand Ultraloq is adept at adding support for the latest smart-home standards into its devices, from Matter to HomeKit. Now, Android users can share a similar experience to Apple Home Key users with an update to its Bolt NFC smart lock ($200), allowing it to work with NFC-enabled Android devices for a tap-to-unlock feature, much like how you tap to pay. It's a feature often touted for iPhones, and usually, you can't switch between ecosystems when a device is compatible with both. The Bolt NFC lock will allow for both Apple and Android devices to wirelessly unlock this smart lock with a tap. Choosing the Apple Key version of Ultraloq's Bolt NFC also allows you to use both Apple and Android devices to instantly unlock the door, so you won't have to choose a single ecosystem if you and your partner each have a different phone of choice. The lock also works with NFC cards and Ultraloq's key fobs. Smokeless firepits are mostly firepits, but with an extra layer of combustion that reduces the resulting smoke considerably. Unlike other firepits on the market, Solo Stove's new Summit Fire Pit includes a patent-pending “Quick-Strike Cone” on its bottom that looks a little like the cinder cone in a volcanic crater. Theoretically, the goal is to make lighting a firepit about as easy as lighting a can of Sterno. The napalm-like flow of fire gel in Solo's marketing video is entrancing, I'll admit. Solo promises that the Summit will create the “most advanced, most beautiful” flame of any Solo firepit, largely because of more intense flames and shorter firepit walls. This smokeless flame show can be yours for $600, around $50 more than the most similar model of Solo Stove firepit without a cinder cone. I have been a staunch advocate of xMEMS' solid-state headphone driver technology ever since I first laid ears on it in a pair of wireless earbuds a few years ago. The drivers don't act like typical pistons or moving coils in speakers, instead using silicon diaphragms and the piezoelectric effect to provide near lightning-fast response. This means perfect phase and excellent detail in your music, and it also means that the drivers are virtually bulletproof. The main issue with xMEMS drivers has been that they aren't great down low. Where previous xMEMS-equipped headphones needed a dynamic driver to handle the low end, thus somewhat defeating the purpose of their indestructibility, this new Cypress model offers 40 times the bass response and can go as low as 20 Hz. This brings listeners one step closer to the washing-machine-ready earbuds we've always wanted, though no brands have announced a pair using these new drivers yet. It's aimed at videographers and features some tech from Red, maker of high-end cinema cameras. The ZR is not a huge Red camera, though. It's in a movie-friendly 16:10 aspect ratio and supports the P3 color gamut. That means video recording up to 6K at 60 frames per second, but the ZR also offers a new RAW video codec called R3D NE1, based on RED's popular R3D RAW codec. Other nice cinema-friendly features in the ZR include support for 32-bit float audio from built-in and external mics, 7.5 stops of built-in image stabilization (IBIS), which is nice because the ZR can take advantage of the wide Z mount to support all kinds of third-party cinema lenses via adapters. You can preorder it at Amazon, B&H Photo, or Adorama. Spotify's VP of Subscriptions acknowledged the long road it's taken to get here, admitting it had “taken time to build this feature in a way that prioritizes quality, ease of use, and clarity at every step.” Spotify says that tracks can be streamed at “up to” 24-bit/44.1 kHz, with listeners able to choose between Low, Normal, High, Very High, and now Lossless quality, customizable across Wi-Fi, cellular, and downloads. Listeners will know when lossless is playing as an indicator will appear in the Now Playing view, or bar. Premium subscribers will be notified when lossless is available to them, with the feature rolling out gradually to more than 50 markets through September and October. Users in the US have already started to get access, but will need to enable it manually on each device they listen with. To do that, tap your profile icon on the top left of the app, go to Settings & Privacy, then Media Quality, and toggle it on.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence and other technological trends are smoothing the way for commercial space ventures ranging from multibillion-dollar companies to a new wave of startups. It probably comes as no surprise that Blue Origin, the space company created by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is taking advantage of AI. “You can imagine this is a favorite area of our founder,” said Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin's vice president of New Glenn strategy and business operations. “So, just generally, we are using it across the board.” For example, Rebel Space is helping satellite companies generate synthetic data that could point to a potential valve failure long before the spacecraft is launched. But capabilities that address national security concerns — for example, maneuvering a satellite out of harm's way or challenging a threatening spacecraft — are among the biggest drivers behind that interest. Portal's Supernova space mobility platform is designed to address that need, with Pentagon backing. Other companies working on in-space mobility include Blue Origin and Tukwila, Wash.-based Starfish Space. Blue Origin's Blue Ring platform is due to fly its first mission next year, with an AI-enabled sensor built by Scout Space for the Space Force as the first announced payload. Meanwhile, Starfish Space is testing its second Otter Pup prototype in orbit, in preparation for a full-scale demonstration mission that could take place next year with Space Force funding. The Trump administration's plans for a missile defense system known as Golden Dome are likely to lead to more contracts for commercial space ventures, potentially focusing on in-space sensing and data processing. “These are particularly in areas like the 200-plus billion dollars that we're going to spend on Golden Dome.” In-space data processing will be valuable in fields that go far beyond national security. Nathan Stein, co-founder and founding scientist at Matter Intelligence, said it's crucial for his company to winnow through the geospatial data that's collected by his company's space sensors while that data is still on the spacecraft. Another potential application involves shifting data centers from terrestrial locations to orbital spots where those power-intensive facilities can draw upon space-based solar power. Redmond, Wash.-based Starcloud is planning to test the concept with NVIDIA computer chips during a demonstration mission that's due for launch as early as November. Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket, which had its first launch in January and can put 45 tons of payload in orbit, will be a big contributor as well. “In terms of competing with terrestrial data centers on energy costs, we are dependent on the launch cost coming down at least one order of magnitude,” Starcloud CEO Philip Johnston said. Mike DeRosa, co-founder and chief marketing officer for Marysville, Wash.-based Gravitics, said he felt the same way about the prospects for getting its space station modules into orbit. There are also reports that SpaceX is working on a project known as Starfall, which would use Starship as a platform for in-space drug research and product development. That would represent yet another product line for SpaceX, which has already branched out from the rocket business with its Starlink satellite broadband network. Andy Lapsa, co-founder and CEO of Kent, Wash.-based Stoke Space, said he's not worried that Starship's rise will hurt his own startup. “I think a successful Starship helps this entire industry move forward. At this point in the industry, a rising tide raises all ships.” NASA's Artemis moon program is a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Blue Origin and other commercial space ventures. Blue Origin is also working on a project called Blue Alchemist, which aims to extract materials from moon dirt and turn them into solar cells, construction materials and oxygen for lunar settlements. Another Seattle-area company, Interlune, has its own plans to extract valuable materials from lunar soil. “Our vision is really big,” Interlune co-founder and CEO Rob Meyerson said. “We want to put a fleet of five electric harvesters on the moon in the 2030s that'll extract this helium-3 gas and bring it back to Earth.” “I see it going further into areas of timekeeping as well as cost tracking, really giving us very accurate models for how much things cost — which could be utilized across the board, or if you're developing satellites, or if you're actually looking at how much it would cost to change frequency bands, change the type of hardware, any of those types of things,” said Kelly Hennig, Stoke Space's chief operating officer. AI also plays a big role in Amazon's Project Kuiper satellite broadband network, which is scheduled to begin delivering service to customers by the end of the year. “Kuiper is a software-defined network, and so AI can have huge productivity gains,” said Chris Weber, Amazon's vice president of sales and marketing for Project Kuiper. Project Kuiper's main objective is to offer high-speed internet access to millions of people around the globe who are currently underserved, but Weber said he's learning about use cases that he hadn't thought about when he joined the Kuiper team 13 months ago. And you can take almost any remote sporting event, be they PGA or Formula One.
