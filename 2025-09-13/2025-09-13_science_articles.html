                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the ways that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) earn their "forever chemical" nickname and persist in the environment is their acidity. Many of these toxic chemicals are highly acidic, meaning they easily give up their protons and become negatively charged. This allows them to dissolve and spread in water more easily. Now, new research has found that some PFAS are even more acidic than previously thought -- an insight critical for predicting their mobility in the environment and potential impacts on human health. Published last month in Environmental Science & Technology Letters, their measurements of these chemicals' acid dissociation constant, or pKa, were mostly lower, in some cases dramatically, than those reported in experimental studies and predicted by computational chemistry models. In one case, the pKa of GenX, a replacement for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in the manufacturing of Teflon, was found to be about one thousand times lower than the measurement listed in a previous study. "These findings suggest that previous measurements have underestimated PFAS' acidity. A chemical's pKa could mean the difference as to whether it remains dissolved in water, sticks to soil or a biological membrane or perhaps volatilizes into the air. "If we're going to understand how these concerning chemicals spread, it's very important we have a reliable method for the accurate determination of their pKa values," says Diana Aga, PhD, director of RENEW and SUNY Distinguished Professor and Henry M. Woodburn Chair in the UB Department of Chemistry. Many of the most scrutinized PFAS have a highly acidic headgroup, making them more likely to give up a proton and exist in its charged form. Whether a PFAS exists in its neutral or charged form depends on the pH level of their surrounding environment. But there has been much disagreement about the pKa measurements of some PFAS, like PFOA, with different teams coming up with widely different values. "In other cases, too much organic solvent is used to get PFAS into solution, which similarly biases the pKa measurement." To address this challenge, the UB team used fluorine and proton (hydrogen) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy -- think MRI for molecules. Reading these atom-level signatures lets the researchers tell whether a PFAS molecule is charged or neutral -- capabilities that other methods that have been used previously cannot provide. "This unique measurement allows NMR to inherently account for PFAS losses to glass or other adsorption behaviors, so your pKa measurements don't end up way off the mark," Hoepker says. Some PFAS are so acidic (pKa of less than zero) that generating them in their neutral form would require super-acidic conditions (a pH level of less than zero) that are impractical in standard labs. "We augmented partial NMR datasets with computational predictions to arrive at more accurate pKa values," Hoepker says. "This NMR-centered hybrid approach -- integrating experimental measurements with computational analyses -- enhanced our confidence in the results and, to our knowledge, has not previously been applied to PFAS acidity." Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) -- an emerging PFAS increasingly detected in waters worldwide and likely transported through the atmosphere and deposited by rain -- was found to be far more acidic than previously reported, with a pKa of around 0.03. Notably, the team determined the pKa values for several prominent emerging PFAS that had never been measured, such as 5:3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (5:3 FTCA), and PFAS ethers like NFDHA and PFMPA that are newer PFAS but are also likely to pose challenges for regulators due to their health effects. "This new experimental approach of determining pKa values for PFAS will have wide-ranging applications, from being able to validate computationally derived values, to facilitating the development of machine learning models that can better predict pKa values of newly discovered PFAS contaminants when reference standards are not available," Aga says. "In turn, knowledge of the pKa values of emerging PFAS will allow researchers to develop appropriate analytical methods, remediation technologies, and risk assessment strategies more efficiently."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We may earn commission if you buy from a link. New research suggests that you should embrace the dark. For centuries, the dark has carried slander: sinister figures, black cats slipping across the path, ghost stories, and hellscapes. For example, families in medieval Europe slept in two acts—a “first sleep,” then a waking hour to pray, make love, or wander to a neighbor's hearth before sinking into “second sleep.” After all, we evolved near the equator, in a rhythm of 12 hours light and 12 dark. Science is now unpicking the cultural script that we should fear the darkness, that it's better to plug in a night light in the house or electrify bright lamps outside our homes. Growing research suggests darkness isn't just a casualty of the social propaganda of light, but may be actively rewriting our biology. Together, the findings show darkness doesn't just calm; it orchestrates the healing, restoration, and balance we may have lost. Also in 2025, scientists found that chamber-based restricted environmental stimulation therapy (REST)—essentially sitting in pitch-black silence—fosters mindfulness, emotional clarity, and calm. Flotation-REST pods—soundproof tanks of body-temperature saltwater—come backed by evidence too. A meta-analysis of 27 trials found that pod sessions lower cortisol, steady blood pressure, and sharpen task performance. Tim Edensor, PhD, is a cultural geographer at Manchester Metropolitan University who has spent decades mapping what he calls the nightscape. Some people feel trapped, but it didn't bother me. So you can't feel your body at all. Like being in your mother's womb, sort of? Not like anything.” Yet he is quick to point out these pods are more than therapy. They prove a larger point: light isn't neutral. In his book, From Light to Dark, he investigated how Western culture turned night into a villain. Think fear, sin, even racial stigma, while light stood for truth and salvation. “That vocabulary is so powerful it's very hard to dislodge,” Edensor says. Neuroscience backs him up: brain scans reveal that phrases like “grasping an idea” fire the same motor circuits as physical grasping, proving words don't just mirror thought—they steer it. So people invented ways to cope, and those responses remain,” Edensor says. But here's the paradox: after centuries of fearing shadow, science now warns us about too much light. A 2025 meta-analysis on artificial illumination at night (ALAN)  linked it to disrupted circadian rhythms, metabolic disease, mood disorders, and even elevated cancer risk. Cities live in “permanent noon,” erasing not just stars but perhaps pieces of our inner selves. Building on classic tactile-vision experiments, his lab developed wearable devices, like the VEST, which translates sound into patterns of vibration on the skin. Over time, users report perceiving the information almost as if they were “seeing” or “hearing” it. Dimness doesn't just change what we perceive; it redistributes the senses themselves. That sensory reshuffling may be playing out in your head right now. As you read this article, competition squeezes your brain in a primal rivalry: the inner world versus the outer. This network is that part of the brain that hums when we daydream, reflect, remember, or imagine the future, and it is in constant tug-of-war with the sensory flood outside. According to “Defensive Activation Theory”—one of the most-cited ideas in dream research—the battle between the external noise and inner soliloquy goes on continuously. When darkness falls, you can't see anymore, but you can still smell, taste, touch, and hear,” he says. And, though their ultimate purpose remains mysterious to this day, many scientists say dreams matter because they help the brain consolidate memories, regulate emotions, and keep learning systems sharp. Not all researchers believe darkness is the magic sauce of a profound inner life though. Some would rather zero in on circadian health, arguing that balance—bright days paired with truly dark nights—matters most. A sweeping 2024 study that logged 13 million hours of personal light exposure found that brighter nights and darker days were tied to higher mortality risks, tied to disruptions in circadian rhythm. Meanwhile, those basking in more daytime brightness fared better. Another 2025 meta-analysis reviewing 74 studies concluded that light exposure boosted mood, reduced fatigue, and strengthened overall well-being. The debate over day and night isn't going away, but the case for more darkness in our lives is gaining ground. The isolation float tank market alone is booming. It's worth about $150 million in 2025 and projected to triple to $450 million by 2033, growing at a blistering 12 percent annually. Meanwhile, the Dark Sky movement, a global push to dim streetlamps, shield fixtures, and curb light pollution, is spreading from Arizona to Slovenia. “Try increasing darkness or sensory deprivation and see how it feels. … If so, maybe it's working for you,” Eagleman suggests. Think of it as a DIY light-or-dark crash-test for your personality. And if you take it up in the witching hours afterward, you may get to meet the stranger living inside.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This lifeform's extraordinary biology could hold the key to anti-aging breakthroughs. Homo sapiens have remarkable regenerative abilities—wounds heal, bone fractures “thread” back together, and some organs can even regrow from devastating injury—but none of these biological bonafides compares to the healing power of the humble starlet sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis). Because of this ability to seemingly defy the aging process, these animals have figured prominently in anti-aging research. Now, in a study published in the journal Science Advances, researchers from the University of Vienna have possibly identified small, multi-potent cells in scarlet sea anemones that basically allow cnidarians to continually drink from the proverbial fountain of youth. In humans, stems cells allow limited regeneration of certain cells in our body (which is why they're central to the exploration of anti-aging therapies), however, other animals display much greater, whole-body regenerative abilities compared to us humans. Because it can reproduce asexually (though it can multiply sexually as well) and can be raised easily in laboratory conditions, N. vectensis has quickly become the go-to species for studying the immortal abilities of cnidarians more broadly (a concept known as a “model organism”). While scientists have known that the scarlet sea anemone shows little to no signs of aging, they haven't been able to identify stem cells that drive this unending youth mainly due to their extremely small size. University of Vienna's Ulrich Technau, the senior author of this new study, and his team used a new method called “single cell genomics” in the hunt for these missing stem cells. The scientists were able to discern the stem cell lineage of certain cells developed based on transcriptome profiles, which are a collection of mRNA transcripts. “By combining single-cell gene expression analyses and transgenesis,” University of Vienna's Andreas Denner, the first author of the study, said in a press statement. The team looked specifically at highly-conserved (i.e. unchanged via evolution) genes nanos and piwi, which are regulatory proteins involved in stem cell differentiation as well as gametogenesis—the process of creating germ cells and gametes (sperm and eggs). When the team mutated the nanos2 gene using CRISPR gene scissors, they discovered that this protein was necessary for forming germ cells as well as somatic cells and likely appeared in nature around  600 million years ago.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new preprint field study reveals that New York City's rats aren't just survivors—they're talkative city dwellers with their own hidden nightlife. We cohabit with a parallel society that commutes along subway rails, picnics in parks and patronizes trash cans like they're Restaurant Row. A new field study watched them the way New Yorkers often watch each other: from a respectful distance and with digital tech. “There's this kind of secret language that rats are communicating in with each other that we don't hear,” says Emily Mackevicius, a neuroscientist and a co-author of the study. “They're very social,” adds Ralph Peterson, another study co-author. They placed thermal cameras on tripods or held them by hand to record the warm bodies moving like glowing, otherworldly specters along the cooler ground. Dmitry Batenkov, a team member who works with machine learning and computational modeling, then converted the two-dimensional videos into three dimensions because 2D recordings distort the size and movement of animals, making rats closer to the camera appear larger.

Since then about 500 generations of brown rats have lived here and have developed unique genetic adaptations related to metabolism, diet, nervous system and locomotion. Even the shape of their heads has changed. And to survive, they need a single daily ounce of water and food, the latter of which we provide in abundance, often processed. Over this past summer in New York City, the research team—Mackevicius, Peterson, Batenkov and Ahmed El Hady, a neuroscientist who has studied rats and collective behavior—came together with a simple yet powerful idea: take what is known about rats from lab research and see how it holds up in the places we share with them. They wanted to do so not just to understand the animals' behavior and cognition in the urban wild but also so that city planners, building managers and public‑health teams could craft decisions with real data to make city life a little less—squeaky. If scientists can more precisely measure rats' complex habits and predilections, they can apply those data to trash pickup timing, building design, disease risk near burrows and even the question of which blocks attract big, bold rats versus skittish juveniles. Peterson, a computational neuroscientist, sums the concept up succinctly. “It's like Sun Tzu says in The Art of War: to defeat your enemy, you have to understand your enemy.” But maybe Mitchell was wrong about the soulless part. One of the rats that the team recorded even soliloquized alone inside a garbage bag—perhaps offering a Yelp review for passing comrades. The study, which was released as a preprint paper that has not yet been peer-reviewed, also revealed that the rats modulated their ultrasonic squeaking based on ambient sound. In the subway system, which was louder than parks and sidewalks, rats communicated more loudly. “They're just kind of screaming to each other, but we just don't hear it.” Peterson, who has studied rodent vocalizations in the lab, was struck by how talkative the vermin were. “Why would you vocalize if not to some end?” he asks. A rat searches for food on a subway platform as commuters look on at the Columbus Circle-59th Street station in Manhattan, NY. “The smaller ones are likely juvenile rats, so they're kind of learning how to forage, and they tend to move a bit more slowly and a bit less in coordination, with bursts of movement,” Mackevicius says. But sometimes the researchers also saw lone rats. “These are big, honking, huge rats,” Peterson says. “This seems like some sort of role that this single rat has, to go out into the environment and assay its surroundings and bring food back or relay information back to the rest of the colony. It had me asking a lot of questions about social hierarchy and delegation of roles and tasks.” Mitchell's 1944 article said exterminators called old rats “Moby Dicks,” a reference to the giant white whale in Herman Melville's classic novel. “Rats that survive to the age of four are the wisest and the most cynical beasts on earth,” Mitchell quoted an exterminator as saying—which matches Peterson's observation about the big, solo scavengers: “They kind of know what they're doing out there,” he says. In Mitchell's article, one New York exterminator argued that buildings had to be rat-proofed, that killing rodents was a waste of time. “It's like taking aspirin for a cancer,” he said. Some contemporary research concurs, noting that poison can endanger pets and the ecosystem and that rats reproduce too quickly for poisoning to work. They become sexually mature in just two to three months, with females going into heat every few days and able to conceive within a day after giving birth. Under ideal conditions, a single pair could theoretically generate thousands of descendants in a year, though survival rates keep numbers much lower. At a city rat-mitigation-training event for community gardens, she learned that rats avoid open space—a tendency confirmed by lab experiments. For instance, community gardeners in New York City often remove clutter to make use of this aversion. Similarly, trash cans tucked into an alley might look like a romantic dinner for two in a dim alcove, but the same cans in an open space could feel like a picnic on the Cross Bronx Expressway. This acute awareness that rats have of open and protected spaces was the other reason that Batenkov converted the 2D videos into 3D: to precisely measure the rats' behaviors in relationship to their settings. “I don't think putting a box with a little piece of cheese in it is going to do anything.... People underestimate how smart the species is.” He believes we should at least consider more futuristic solutions, even if they might sound zany. “We can build little robotic systems that sense [rat] movement and shine light at them or sense their movement and play certain vocalizations back at them,” he suggests, “and do this in a very dynamic way that addresses this issue of how to mitigate a smart species.” At very least, the city could use the team's surveillance system to create a low-cost network that detects rat hot spots and infestation spikes—a real-time rodent weather report that would allow city officials to target their responses. This humane, data-driven pest control would be safer for people, pets, and the ecosystem and could even be generalized to deal with other urban cotenants, from raccoons to stray dogs. Then it popped back up and started running away. It's perhaps evidence of a rat playing dead in the wild, which we know that other species do.” Mackevicius had previously been studying birds in central park, and when she started on rats, she was surprised by how friends reacted. “Then they would offer their own personal rat story,” Peterson recalls. There's this kind of childlike intrigue that everyone in the city has, which feels interesting, especially in a very divisive time. Deni Ellis Béchard is Scientific American's senior tech reporter.

"Companies have their roadmaps of where they want to be in 10 to 20 years and beyond," said Michael Tsapatsis, a Bloomberg Distinguish Professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at Johns Hopkins University. "One hurdle has been finding a process for making smaller features in a production line where you irradiate materials quickly and with absolute precision to make the process economical." The advanced lasers required for imprinting on the miniscule formats already exist, Tsapatsis added, but researchers needed new materials and new processes to accommodate ever smaller microchips. Microchips are flat pieces of silicon with imprinted circuitries that execute basic functions. However, the higher-powered radiation beams that are needed to carve out ever-smaller details on chips do not interact strongly enough with traditional resists. Previously, researchers from Tsapatsis's lab and the Fairbrother Research Group at Johns Hopkins found that resists made of a new class of metal-organics can accommodate that higher-powered radiation process, called "beyond extreme ultraviolet radiation" (B-EUV), which has the potential to make details smaller than the current standard size of 10 nanometers. Metals like zinc absorb the B-EUV light and generate electrons that cause chemical transformations needed to imprint circuit patterns on an organic material called imidazole. This research marks one of the first times scientists have been able to deposit these imidazole-based metal-organic resists from solution at silicon-wafer scale, controlling their thickness with nanometer precision. And that opens us up to creating new metal-organic pairings," Tsapatsis said. "The exciting thing is there are at least 10 different metals that can be used for this chemistry, and hundreds of organics." The researchers have started experimenting with different combinations to create pairings specifically for B-EUV radiation, which they say will likely be used in manufacturing in the next 10 years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Referring to a situation in which it is impossible to describe the physics of each photon separately, this key characteristic of quantum mechanics defies the classical expectation that each particle should have a reality of its own, which gravely concerned Einstein. Developing such technologies will require the ability to freely generate a multi-photon quantum entangled state, and then to efficiently identify what kind of entangled state is present. However, when performing conventional quantum tomography, a method commonly used for state estimation, the number of measurements required grows exponentially with the number of photons, posing a significant data collection problem. This motivated a team of researchers at Kyoto University and Hiroshima University to take on this challenge, ultimately succeeding in developing a new method of entangled measurement to identify the W state. They created a device to demonstrate the proposed method for three photons using high-stability optical quantum circuits, which allowed the device to operate stably without active control for an extended period of time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unlike conventional phases of matter, the so-called non-equilibrium quantum phases are defined by their dynamical and time-evolving properties -- a behavior that cannot be captured by traditional equilibrium thermodynamics. Using a 58 superconducting qubit quantum processor, the team from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Princeton University, and Google Quantum AI realized a Floquet topologically ordered state, a phase that had been theoretically proposed but never before observed. This allowed them to witness the dynamical "transmutation" of exotic particles - a hallmark that has been theoretically predicted for these exotic quantum states. "Our results show that quantum processors are not just computational devices - they are powerful experimental platforms for discovering and probing entirely new states of matter."
