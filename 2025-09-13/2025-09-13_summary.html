News network Milenio releases public apology after US deputy secretary of state threatens to revoke Mexican visas

A congressional staffer from Mexico's ruling party has resigned after being called out online for comments he made on a major Mexican television news program about Turning Point USA executive director Charlie Kirk's murder.

The news network, Milenio, also released a public apology after the United States' deputy secretary of state – a former ambassador to Mexico – evidently threatened to have Donald Trump's presidential administration revoke any US visas on which it may count.

The episode that unfolded at Milenio continued a trend of people losing their jobs over commentary about Kirk – a self-proclaimed free-speech advocate – deemed offensive by American conservatives, though in this instance it was outside the US.

Kirk, a close Trump ally, was shot dead Wednesday while speaking at a university in Utah. Following his death, conservative commentators, activists and public officials in the US have engaged in social media campaigns against people accused of disrespecting Kirk's memory.

A Saturday morning tally by Reuters showed that at least 15 people had been fired or suspended.

On Thursday, Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state and former US Mexican ambassador, warned on X that “foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country”.

“Please feel free to bring such comments by foreigners to my attention so that the state department can protect the American people,” said Landau, who was appointed US ambassador to Mexico and served from 2019 to 2021 during Trump's first presidency.

People began responding to Landau's post with examples of foreign nationals criticizing or making light of Kirk's death. Among those was a clip of Salvador Ramírez, a social communications coordinator for the ruling Morena party, speaking on a television news program on Milenio.

Ramírez appeared on a roundtable political analysis program with Milenio, discussing Kirk's killing.

“I think if Charlie Kirk lived, he may like what I am about to say, because what I am about to say is very ‘anti-woke',” Ramírez facetiously said. “He was given a spoonful of his own chocolate. They gave a spoonful to someone who promoted the use of weapons. They gave a spoonful to someone who was financed by the National Rifle Association – a political association that is of the extreme right, pro-Trump, of the most radical wing of the Republicans.”

Ramírez added that Turning Point USA was “an anti-rights, anti-LGBT – practically anti-women – movement”.

After a post tagging Milenio and the Morena party made Landau aware of Ramirez's comments, he responded with an image reading “El Quitavisas”, roughly meaning “the visa remover”. Minutes later, Landau went after Milenio itself, which is one of the most watched and read news outlets in Mexico.

“Really, Milenio? This is the level of ‘discourse' that you promote on your channel? I am embarrassed for having interacted with you during my tenure as United States ambassador to Mexico,” Landau wrote.

Milenio released a public statement on Friday, apologizing for Ramirez's comments, saying the outlet does not “promote nor accept expressions of hate, violence or disqualification towards any person or group”.

“We regret that the remarks made during one of our programs may have upset or offended a part of the audience, and we offer a sincere apology to those who felt offended,” the statement read.

Ramirez then released a video on Friday afternoon apologizing for his “very unfortunate” comments, saying they were his own thoughts and not representative of the Morena party nor of Milenio. Later that evening, Ramirez officially announced his resignation from the parliamentary group for the Morena party within the Mexican house of representatives.

Others who had similarly lost their jobs or been disciplined at them over commentary about Kirk's killing have included journalists, academic workers, teachers, nurses a Secret Service employee, a firefighter and a worker for an NFL team.

Previously, the Trump administration has targeted people, including students and academic workers, for expressing pro-Palestinian sentiments on social media and for participating in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.

The FBI announced on Friday that Kirk's alleged killer had been arrested after a two-day manhunt.

            Dozens of social media posts and messages about the murder of Charlie Kirk, including some that celebrated his death, are being spotlighted by conservative activists, Republican elected officials and a doxxing website as part of an online campaign to punish the posters behind the messages.
    


            Prominent far-right influencer Laura Loomer, a US senator, and a site called “Expose Charlie's Murderers” have all drawn attention to people who have posted messages about Kirk's Wednesday assassination.
    


            The campaigns show how social media posts or personal messages — even by accounts with few followers or from people who are not public figures — could easily be surfaced and publicized, and people's personal information can be spread across the internet at a time when doxxing is easier than ever.
    


            The Charlie's Murderers site, whose domain was registered anonymously and which says it is not a doxxing site, claims it has “received nearly 30,000 submissions,” according to a message on the site's front page on midday Saturday. Currently, there are a few dozen submissions published on the site. “This website will soon be converted into a searchable database of all 30,000 submissions, filterable by general location and job industry. This is a permanent and continuously-updating archive of Radical activists calling for violence.”
    


            Most people whose messages have been posted on the site do not seem to refer to themselves as activists, nor did it seem many were calling for violence. Administrators for the site did not respond to a request for comment. The site also opened an X account on Friday.
    


            Loomer posted on X on Wednesday, hours after the fatal shooting, that “I will be spending my night making everyone I find online who celebrates his death Famous, so prepare to have your whole future professional aspirations ruined if you are sick enough to celebrate his death.” CNN was unable to reach Loomer for comment.
    


            On X, one account has begun a running “Trophy Case” — a “mega-thread of all of the people Twitter gets fired, updated live as the news comes in,” with dozens of entries of people it claims have lost their jobs.
    


            And after MSNBC fired senior political analyst Matthew Dowd after he said Kirk's rhetoric might have contributed to his shooting, President Donald Trump himself weighed in.
    


            “They fired this guy, Dowd from (MSNBC), who's a terrible guy, terrible human being, but they fired him. I hear they're firing other people,” Trump said on Fox News on Friday morning. On his Substack after the firing, Dowd said the “Right Wing media mob” attacked him on several platforms. CNN has reached out to Dowd for comment.
    


            Some of the people whose posts have been highlighted say they're now receiving a barrage of harassment and are worried about becoming the victims of violence.
    


            For example, Canadian independent journalist Rachel Gilmore posted that she is “terrified” about retaliation from Kirk's “far-right fans” after the shooting. That post is the first listed on the anonymous website, including a part where Gilmore said she hoped Kirk survives. She said in a video online that she did not celebrate Kirk's death and said she hoped he survives in another post. She also said she received a “tsunami” of threats and called the last 48 hours of her life “a living hell.”
    


Rebekah Jones, a former Florida coronavirus data scientist who in 2022 claimed the state of Florida pressured her to manipulate pandemic data, said she contacted the police twice about death threats and about the “hit list,” her name for the anonymous site. Jones posted about Kirk on Wednesday, writing: “Save your sympathies for the innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire of MAGA's violent political messaging machine.” The website republished that post along with other pieces of Jones' personal information.
    


            “It is absolutely fair to call it a coordinated harassment campaign,” said Laura Edelson, assistant professor at Northeastern University and director of the Cybersecurity for Democracy Project. “That's absolutely why it exists, to coordinate and target the harassment toward the selected individuals.”
    


            Some Republican elected officials are also publicizing people who posted about Kirk's murder, including some public-sector employees like teachers.
    


            Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said a Middle Tennessee State University employee should be removed after writing they had “ZERO sympathy” for Kirk's death. The university confirmed to CNN in a statement that the employee was fired “effective immediately.”
    


            “No university employee who celebrates the assassination of Charlie Kirk should be trusted to shape the minds of the next generation in the classroom. The firing of this MTSU employee was the right decision, and it sends a clear message that this kind of reprehensible behavior must not be tolerated,” Blackburn said in a statement to CNN.
    


            GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina also encouraged the firing of a public school teacher, whom the school district later confirmed to local news was no longer employed with the district.
    


            And private companies, such as Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers and the Carolina Panthers, have also let employees go for their social media posts about Kirk.
    


            DC Comics canceled the just-released “Red Hood” comic book series after its author, Gretchen Felker-Martin, made comments about Kirk's death on social media.
    


            In since-deleted posts captured in screengrabs shared by other social media users, Felker-Martin allegedly wrote on social media after news of Kirk's death: “Hope the bullet's OK.”
    


            “At DC Comics, we place the highest value on our creators and community and affirm the right to peaceful, individual expression of personal viewpoints. Posts or public comments that can be viewed as promoting hostility or violence are inconsistent with DC's standards of conduct,” the company, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, said in a statement. CNN has reached out to representatives for Felker-Martin for comment.
    


            In most places, private companies can fire employees for any reason — and that includes crass social media posts, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a professor of labor and employment law at the University of North Carolina. It's a little trickier for public sector employees, but their firings are also justified if the speech is “so egregious it disrupts operations.”
    


            In a 1987 case, the Supreme Court decided that it was constitutionally protected speech, and not grounds for firing, for a government employee to tell her co-workers she was sorry that a would-be assassin failed to kill President Reagan.
    


            And it's extra sensitive for teachers, Hirsch said, since they work with young people, especially if the posts are applauding political violence. “The reality of the situation is, if they're getting flooded, even if it's from one political wing, with complaints, it's likely to push an employer to fire somebody,” he said.
    


            In other cases, some social media users highlighted Kirk's pro-Second Amendment stance, including past news reports that he said some gun deaths were “unfortunately” worth it to keep the Second Amendment.
    


            The highlighted social media entries span a range of responses to Kirk's shooting. One post, for example, simply noted the world continued on.
    


            The website says its explicit aim is to get the people it spotlights fired. It was registered through a privacy service with an address in Iceland.
    


            And the site's name already implies that the people whose information it shares are responsible for Kirk's murder, paving the way for harassment, Hank Teran, CEO at open-source threat intelligence platform Open Measures, told CNN. The website also echoes back to Kirk-founded conservative group Turning Point's “Professor Watchlist,” whose purpose was to unmask what it called “radical professors,” but often led to harassment and violent threats directed toward people named on that list.
    


            Altogether, “it could be reasonable to conclude that there's some intent to incite harassment,” Teran said.
    


            High political tensions across the country are ramping up people's emotional responses, said Edelson, the Northeastern professor, and it “creates a need to do something.”
    


            The blanket blame on “the left” in some cases extends the blame past the shooter into an amorphous enemy, Whitney Phillips, assistant professor of information politics and ethics at the University of Oregon, told CNN.
    


            “Attempts to call out people designated as being celebratory of Kirk's death, or merely critical of Kirk's life, work to give shape and weight to that enemy,” Philips said. That feeds into “a false culture war framing.” As a result, she said, disconnected groups can be perceived as “a downright spiritual enemy of conservatives, and by extension, of America itself.”

After a connection to ‘trans ideology' was retracted, suspect's background and politics are being pored over

Though the suspect in the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk was revealed by authorities on Friday, questions surrounding his identity and motivations have exacerbated intense US political debates in the aftermath of the shooting.

Authorities revealed Kirk's suspected killer to be Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old man who grew up in Washington, Utah, along the state's south-western border.

In absence of a clear motive for the slaying, reports have tried to piece together information about Robinson and his background. He is a third-year student in an electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in the state. Both of his parents are registered Republicans, though his personal political beliefs remain unclear. Now-deleted pictures on social media show Robinson and his family posing with guns.

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Saturday, Utah's governor, Spencer Cox, said: “It's very clear to us and to investigators that this was a person who was deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology.” Cox cited the findings of the ongoing investigation into Robinson and his possible motive but did not provide any further details about how officials arrived at that conclusion.

The FBI declined to comment about reporting on Saturday by conservative media outlets Fox News and the New York Post, citing law enforcement sources, that Robinson lived with a partner who was trans – a member of a community against whom Kirk rallied – and was cooperating with investigators.

Regardless, Cox's remarks were published a day after he delivered a speech following Robinson's arrest in which he had a candid moment about Robinson's identity as a Utahn.

“Bad stuff happens, and for 33 hours, I was praying that if this had to happen here, it wouldn't be one of us,” Cox said. “That somebody drove from another state, somebody came from another country. Sadly, that prayer was not answered the way I hoped for.”

He went on to explain that it would have been “easier on us” if the suspect weren't from the community.

“Just because I thought it would make it easier on us to say, ‘Hey, we don't do that here.' Indeed, Utah is a special place, we lead the nation in charitable giving, we lead the nation in service every year,” Cox said, tears welling in his eyes. “But it did happen here, and it was one of us.”

After Robinson's identity was revealed, some conservatives have softened their attacks against Kirk's alleged murderer as an individual – but continue to leverage anger toward liberals as a group.

Republican congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina tweeted on Wednesday that “it's time to bring back the death penalty” following Kirk's murder.

On Friday, Mace said that Kirk “would want us to pray for such an evil and lost individual like Tyler Robinson to find Jesus Christ”.

“We will try to do the same,” she wrote.

She later doubled down on the death penalty, saying: “Some crimes are so evil, the only just punishment is the death penalty.” But, referring to the way the suspect's father reportedly had a role in turning him over to authorities, she also said: “We are sending prayers and our high regards to Tyler Robinson's father for doing the right thing.”

Cox's speech has largely been praised as highlighting unity during a divisive moment, providing a stark contrast to Donald Trump, who considered Kirk a close ally. The president on Friday appeared on Fox & Friends and was asked by host Ainsley Earhardt, “How do we fix this country? How do we come back together?”

“The radicals on the right are radical because they don't want to see crime,” Trump said. “The radicals on the left are the problem – and they are vicious and horrible and politically savvy. They want men in women's sports, they want transgender people, they want open borders. The worst thing that happened to this country.”

Conservatives had latched onto reports – that have since been retracted – that the casings for bullets found with the gun that police suspect was used to kill Kirk were engraved with markings indicating “trans ideology”.

“To the surprise of literally no one,” Megyn Kelly said on her show earlier in the aftermath of Kirk's killing. “There's one particular group that's been running around killing Americans in the name of ideology, and it's transgender activists or individuals, or those who proclaim that they are.”

Once Robinson's identity was revealed, Kelly speculated that Robinson must have been radicalized after going to college.

“This kid got radicalized, and obviously had a psychotic break … I am disturbed to see that he appears to have come from a loving, intact family,” Kelly said. “If you look at the family social media profile, it looks like a happy family. It looks like a loving mom, and a loving dad. He had two younger brothers, there's lots of family photos of them going on vacations and family dinners.”

Kelly noted that while authorities will be seeking the death penalty, it is ultimately a “mental health issue” that underpins the “radicalization” of young people who go to college.

Meanwhile, white nationalist Nick Fuentes sought to shut down speculation that Robinson may have been a “Groyper”, a nickname for a follower of Fuentes, after reports on the engravings on the bullets of the alleged killer's gun led to theorizing on his ideology.

Groypers had long criticized Kirk and trolled speakers at his events because the former perceived the latter to be too politically moderate.

While Fuentes claimed in a social media post that he and his followers were “currently being framed for the murder of Charlie Kirk,” he also said in a streaming video: “I pray to God there is no further violence.”

“To all of my followers, if you take up arms, I disavow you,” Fuentes said. “I disown you in the strongest possible terms.”

As an alderperson in northwestern Spain, Rosana Prieto tends to the running of her tiny village and is far removed from major cities, often rocked by protests over geopolitical issues. But with one of the world's biggest cycling races coursing through the bucolic hills nearby, she and hundreds of like-minded townspeople sensed a chance to make their small voices heard, denouncing Israel's military campaign in Gaza.

Palestinian flags in hand, they stood precisely where they knew the television cameras would broadcast their message to the world: the last turn before the finish line of the 15th stage, as cyclists of the Spanish Vuelta whirred past. Further up the road, a protester carrying a Palestinian flag got too close to the speeding peloton and caused a pair of cyclists to crash.

Protests targeting an Israeli-owned team have repeatedly seized the limelight at the Vuelta, Spain's version of the Tour de France, in which over 180 cyclists pedal 3,100 kilometres through rural Spain's sleepy back-roads. Six of the last 10 days of racing have been either cut short or interrupted, with over 20 people detained by police.

Quebec bracing for protests with arrival of Israel-Premier Tech cycling team

Israel's 23-month military grind into Palestinian territory, launched in response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, deadly attack on Israel, had already enraged many Spaniards, including its outspoken left-wing government. The protests on the sidelines of the Vuelta have earned the government's tacit endorsement and catalyzed nudging it toward staking out one of the strongest positions against Israel of any European nation since the sustained military operation began.

“The protests were born from the idea that our only chance to defend human rights regarding Israel is the Spanish Vuelta,” Prieto, 48, told The Associated Press by phone. “It is an international spotlight for us to say that we are against what Israel is doing.”

Israel has defended its military actions in Gaza and accused Spain of standing with Hamas. 

The war has so far killed at least 64,803 people in the Gaza Strip, according to the territory's health ministry, as famine grips its largest city.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez joined Ireland and Norway in recognizing a Palestinian state last year, and Spain became the first European country to ask a U.N. court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide.

The Vuelta protesters argue that if Russian teams have been banned from international sporting events for the war in Ukraine, then Israeli teams should likewise be punished.

Spain's government agrees.

Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares said he would support the Israeli-owned team's expulsion from the race, while government spokesperson Pilar Alegría, who is also minister of sports and education, said neutrality is no longer possible in the face of the death and destruction in Gaza.

“What we are seeing at the protests, in my opinion, is logical,” Alegría told Cadena Ser radio on Sept. 11. “Sports cannot be isolated from the world that surrounds them.”

Opinion: Pro-Palestinian activists are applying a double standard at one of pro cycling's premier events

For the Vuelta's security detail, it was logistically impossible to lock down the entire route through its twisting roads, much of which is lined by forest. Large groups have gathered in towns and protesters have jumped out of cover to block the path of riders, causing two athletes to crash, although it's unclear if that was the protesters' intention. Neither of the riders who crashed was on the Israeli team. The cyclists participating in the race voted Wednesday that they would quit if their safety was again put at risk.

The team under fire, Israel Premier Tech — which only has one Israeli rider at the Vuelta — issued a statement saying that quitting the race is out of the question, as it would “set a dangerous precedent.”

But Israel Premier Tech has been endeavoring to keep a low profile. Riders have avoided speaking to the media and it took the step midrace of removing its team name from its riding uniforms.

The team is owned by Israeli-Canadian businessman Sylvan Adams, who emigrated to Israel in 2016, and has played a key role in promoting Israel via sports. He helped arrange Israel's hosting of the start of Giro d'Italia, cycling's third Grand Tour race, in 2018.

“Great job to Sylvan and Israel's cycling team for not giving in to hate and intimidation,” Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted to social media platform X on Sept. 5. “You make Israel proud!”

There have been occasional confrontations between police, security personnel, and protesters. Prieto said that she needed medical treatment for abrasions and knocks after a police officer dragged her across the ground. She said she and her cohorts behaved peacefully, and is waiting to see whether she faces charges.

Cycling teams have decried some protester actions. Joxean Fernández Matxin, the team boss of UAE Emirates, said that some of them hit riders with flag poles and tossed tacks in their path.

“Everyone has a right to protest, but it's a shame that it has to happen here and in this way and that we can't finish the race,” race leader Jonas Vingegaard, a two-time Tour de France winner, said after Wednesday's stage finish was shortened.

Reigning Tour champion Tadej Pogačar skipped the Vuelta. Yet cycling's biggest star was worried that the protests could spread to other races.

“I think all the riders are a little scared of what could happen,” Pogačar told reporters in Quebec Thursday. “When we see what's going on at the Vuelta, we talk about it and we think it could happen here or in other races between now and the end of the season.”

The next day, a few dozen protesters gathered in the Canadian city of Quebec during a one-day race Pogačar participated in.

As the protests disrupted the Vuelta, a fleet of activists' ships loaded with humanitarian aid set sail from Barcelona, aiming to break Israel's naval blockade of the Gaza Strip.

Spain's prime minister chose this week to denounce Israel's operations in Gaza as “genocide” and make a nationally televised address announcing an arms embargo and blocking Israel-bound fuel deliveries from passing through Spanish ports.

The move inflamed a diplomatic dispute that resulted in the ban of ministers from both countries. Israeli leaders called the Spanish government's actions “antisemitic” and a “blatant genocidal threat.”

If the protests gain strength, they could become a concern for Israel, which has long prided itself on its close relations with the European Union. The European Commission's president, Ursula von der Leyen, this week called for partially suspending trade ties with Israel, and the Netherlands said it would boycott the popular Eurovision song contest next year if Israel is allowed to participate.

For analyst Oriol Bartomeus, professor of political science at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, Sánchez's long campaign against Israel's incursion in Gaza is both benefiting from and fueling the grassroots protest movement at the cycling race.

“What is happening at the Vuelta is a symptom of the anger of the left over this issue,” Bartomeus told the AP. “This is poised to be a major point of cohesion of Spanish society. Sánchez is not stupid, and he has gotten right in there.”

Protesters aim to take action again on Sunday, when the race concludes in Madrid. Authorities will deploy 1,500 police for the final stage, adding to the 130 officers already traveling with the race.

            The Vatican has brought together an eclectic mix of thinkers and music artists as it seeks to influence both the development of artificial intelligence and the future of humanity.
    


            A summit held Friday and Saturday on “human fraternity” convened Nobel prize winners to discuss everything from agriculture to the economy to sport, before culminating with an historic concert in St. Peter's Square directed by American singer-songwriter Pharrell Williams and celebrated Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli.
    


            Among those taking part in the AI discussions was Will.i.am, front man for the Black Eyed Peas, who has been involved with AI since 2012, after attending classes by the late Patrick Winston, a computer scientist from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The rapper and singer, who heads a technology company called FYI.AI and supports computer science education in Los Angeles, believes the church and Pope Leo XIV have a role to play in developing AI that serves humanity.
    


            He told CNN that the Vatican event offered a “safe haven” for brainstorming on AI. It “demands that people center themselves around what's good for humanity,” he said, and “that they build systems that are for community and the improvement of society. That's the thesis of why they come to the Vatican.”
    


            He added: “I think governments need to get up to speed and put some regulations and governance in place, not to stifle growth but just to ensure that society is safe.”

            For several years, the Vatican been pushing for a more ethical AI through meetings with leaders of tech companies, and Pope Francis called in 2023 for a “binding international treaty” to prevent harmful practices and encourage the best ones.



            The latest discussions, which took place in Rome's Palazzo Altieri, covered similar themes, with speakers including Geoffrey Hinton, known as “the Godfather of AI,” physicist and author Max Tegmark of MIT, Jimena Sofía Viveros Álvarez, a scholar and leading voice for ethical AI, and Marco Trombetti, founder and chief executive of Translated, which utilizes AI for translation services.
    


            Trombetti, who uses a mix of AI and human translators, told CNN that the development of AI risks creating a “digital divide” between countries which do and do not have access to the technology. He described the Vatican's role in discussions as significant because Pope Leo is a “magnet for talent” who has an “incredible power for spreading ideas.”
    


            The latest summit was in the works before Pope Francis died in April, triggering the process to elect his successor. Organizers then scrambled to prepare the event, which included a round table on the news media in which Mark Thompson, the chief executive and chairman of CNN, took part, as did Maria Ressa, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and chief executive of the Rappler news site.
    


            On Saturday, a “human constitutional assembly” was presided over by Graça Machel, widow of South Africa's late President Nelson Mandela, and attended by several Nobel laureates.
    


            While Italian-centric and dominated by speeches, the event underlined the Vatican and the papacy's convening power. Ressa, who was awarded the Nobel for efforts to safeguard freedom of expression in the Philippines, told CNN that “if you don't talk about humanity at the Vatican, I don't know what else (you would talk about).”
    


            For her part, Machel said the event showed that leaders have the capacity to “re-design the world” to protect life and ensure people have work, food and shelter.
    


            Pope Leo addressed the participants Friday in the Vatican's apostolic palace, where he urged them to “identify local and international ways of developing new forms of social charity” and to see the “image of God in the face of the poor, the refugee and even the adversary.” Later that evening, he sent a message thanking people on the Italian island of Lampedusa, a frequent entry point for migrants from north Africa, for welcoming new arrivals and hinting that he could make a visit. Back in 2013, Pope Francis made his first visit outside of Rome to Lampedusa.
    


            Speaking about Leo's election as the first American pope, Will.i.am said it was a “beautiful” thing given “all the things that are happening in America.” On Friday, an undocumented migrant in a suburb of Chicago was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer after resisting arrest. “I wish we treated Chicago and inner cities better going through tough times with a human, delicate approach,” Will.i.am said. “The fact that we have a pope from Chicago gives me hope.”
    


            The concert in St. Peter's Square on Saturday evening, open to everyone, is the first of its kind to be held in the Vatican. The line-up includes John Legend, Teddy Swims, Karol G and features an unlikely return to performing by hip-hop duo Clipse, which includes brothers Gene and Terrence Thornton (No Malice and Pusha T). Will.i.am, who is not performing, said he hoped that the crowd might sing one of the Black Eyed Peas' best known songs – “Where Is The Love?” – because “the world needs it.”
    


            Meanwhile, as the summit was taking place, Pope Leo received the diplomatic credentials of the new US Ambassador to the Holy See, Brian Burch. Burch, who is from Chicago, was the co-founder of Catholic Vote, a political organization that backed President Donald Trump in the 2024 election. While presenting his credentials, he  gave Leo a cake to mark the pope's 70th birthday this Sunday. According to the US Embassy to Holy See X account, during their meeting pope “underscored that our political differences can never be resolved with violence and told Ambassador Burch that he was praying for the widow of Mr. Kirk and his children.”

The Israeli Prime Minister declared “there will be no Palestinian state” as he signed the plan.

With a growing number of countries around the world recognizing Palestinian statehood, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday declared that “there will be no Palestinian state” as he signed an agreement to develop a key settlement in the West Bank — prompting calls for the international community to hold Israel accountable for its illegal occupation and apartheid policies in Palestinian territories.

At an event in the settlement of Maale Adumim, Netanyahu was joined by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Construction and Housing Minister Haim Katz as he signed an agreement with the town to develop 3,400 new housing units in the E1 settlement, which has long been stalled due to US opposition.

The Trump administration has reversed that opposition, clearing the way for Israel to link thousands of illegal settlements together and cut off East Jerusalem — which Palestinians have named as the future capital of a Palestinian state — from the rest of the West Bank.

Netanyahu said Thursday that the plan will “double the population” of Israelis in Maale Adumim, which like all of Israel's settlements in the West Bank is illegal under international law. Last year, the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel's occupation of Gaza and the West Bank is illegal and said it was guilty of confiscating “large areas” of Palestinian land for Israeli settlers.

“We are going to fulfill our promise that there will be no Palestinian state. This place belongs to us,” said Netanyahu.

As +972 magazine reported Friday, 7,000 Palestinians in the West Bank face forced displacement if the plan moves forward, and north-south travel could become “almost impossible,” as the proposed settlement would establish separate roads for Palestinians and Israelis and would divert Palestinian drivers from Route 1 onto a bypass.

The town of Ezariyah, where many current residents travel frequently for shopping and other daily needs, “would become a geographically isolated island,” Mohammad Mattar, a member of the town's municipality, told +972. “The road will cut right against people's homes, leaving no room for natural expansion, and the town will lose thousands of dunams of land. This will force many residents to leave and deal a devastating economic blow.”

Mattar said that 112 demolition orders have already been issued for homes, shops, factories, and farmland.

“Some businesses have already evacuated and cut their losses, while others are waiting,” he said. “It will force many residents to leave, particularly Jerusalemites who have built their lives and livelihoods around the town.”

On Thursday, the Israeli anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now reported that it had prepared billboards denouncing the E1 plan to display in Maale Adumim during Netanyahu's event, but Mayor Guy Yifrah blocked them from being displayed.

In addition to “burying” the possibility of a Palestinian state, as Smotrich said last month, “the annexation led by Smotrich and Netanyahu will bury Israel,” Peace Now said.

The billboard in the photo was banned, but silencing protest won't hide the truth: the annexation led by Smotrich and Netanyahu will bury Israel. Only a Palestinian state alongside Israel can bring security and peace. 2/3

Nabil Abu Rudeineh, presidential spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank, told Al Jazeera that a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital is “inevitable” regardless of Netanyahu's agreement to the E1 plan.

Rudeineh noted that 149 United Nations member states have recognized Palestinian statehood, with the number jumping in recent months as countries including France and Ireland have announced their recognition, and called on other countries to do the same to increase pressure on Netanyahu to back off the E1 plan.

“As more governments recognize a Palestinian state, it makes it harder for Netanyahu to proceed with his preferred options — mass expulsion (no Palestinians for a state) or endless apartheid (oppressive occupation with no state),” said Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch, last week.

Inès Abdel Razek, executive director of the Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy, told +972 that with Israel starving the people of Gaza with its blockade on humanitarian aid and slaughtering more than 64,000 Palestinians there so far since beginning its bombardment of the exclave nearly two years ago while also stepping up violence in the West Bank, the recognition of a Palestinian state by individual countries is “increasingly irrelevant.”

“The most we can say about the fact that governments choose recognition as a measure right now, in the midst of a genocide that needs to end, is that it is really too little, too late,” she told +972. “What governments should be doing, not only as a moral obligation, but as a political and legal obligation under international law, is to end the genocide and the occupation, and to hold Israel accountable.”

“For the PA, recognition is a victory,” said Abdel Razek. “But if you look on the ground, there is little resembling a Palestinian state… What does exist are Palestinians themselves, fighting to remain on their land and to see their fundamental right to self-determination fulfilled.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Two-year attempt to prosecute opponents of police training center on criminal conspiracy charges ends in failure

Georgia prosecutors are facing what one expert called “probably the highest-profile failure of using conspiracy charges to indict a protest movement” in US history, after a two-year attempt to prosecute a criminal conspiracy in connection with opposition to the police training center known as Cop City.

Fulton county superior court Judge Kevin Farmer announced his decision to dismiss charges against the case's 61 defendants during hearings this week on a handful of defense attorney motions.

The hearings came after several years of delays in the case centered on Rico, a law created to go after the mafia and usually associated with organized crime, not protest movements. Farmer's decision responded to a motion filed on behalf of defendant Thomas Jurgens, an attorney acting as a legal observer for the National Lawyers Guild at a music festival on 5 March 2023 in a forested public park near the police training center site.

Jurgens was one of dozens arrested that day and charged in connection with damage done to construction machinery at the site.

After an hour-plus of discussion in this week's hearing, Farmer came back from a break and used only 18 words to stymie the state's prosecution, nearly three years after arrests: “At this time I do not find the attorney general had the authority to bring this Rico case.”

The decision dismisses charges in 100 pages of the state's 109–page indictment. It also covers one count of arson against five defendants, and the judge is expected to issue a separate ruling on domestic terrorism charges against the same five defendants.

Farmer said he will soon issue the orders in writing.

The state has announced its intention to appeal. “The attorney general will continue the fight against domestic terrorists and violent criminals who want to destroy life and property,” Georgia attorney general Chris Carr's office said in a statement.

Carr is running for governor of Georgia in next year's race.

Opposition to the $109m center, which opened this spring, has come from a wide range of local and national organizations and protesters, and is centered on concerns around police militarization and clearing forests in an era of climate crisis. Atlanta police say the center is needed for “world-class” training and to attract new officers.

This week's decision “exposes that the indictment was fundamentally flawed from the outset”, said Brad Thomson, one of the case's dozens of defense attorneys and a member of the People's Law Office, a Chicago-based civil rights firm.

Farmer's ruling from the bench was based on Carr's office having pursued the case after district attorneys for Dekalb and Fulton counties had declined to do so. This was an action for which the state had no authority, and for which the attorney general would have required special permission from Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, the judge said. No such permission was sought or given.

The decision shows “what critics said all along – that the state of Georgia was in such a rush and panic to stop the ‘Stop Cop City' movement that they violated their own rules,” said social movement historian Dan Berger. “They acted inappropriately and without justification, to bring what seemed from the beginning as dramatically overblown and patently absurd charges.”

Although certainly the most dramatic, the state's procedural negligence leading to the judge's decision was not the only example of prosecutorial sloppiness during the last two years.

Deputy attorney general John Fowler, the case's lead prosecutor, was found last year to have obtained emails between defendants and their attorneys, then including them in discovery materials and sharing them with police investigators, thereby violating attorney-client privilege.

Fowler also denied in court that police sent messages about Cop City using Signal, despite being presented, in another motion from defense attorneys, with evidence from the Guardian of law enforcement leadership ordering officers last year to download the encrypted phone app for that very purpose.

At one point this week, the judge noted that he had read all the defense's motions, but had received no responses from the state. “I have nothing to read from the state – and it's been two years,” Farmer said.

Representing members of Atlanta Solidarity Fund – a bail fund whose three members are mentioned more than 120 times in the indictment – veteran attorney Donald Samuel told the judge this week, “the [criminal] enterprise is defined as a movement – can you imagine that? The civil rights movement would be defined as an enterprise according to the attorney general!”

Joseph Brown, a political scientist who has written about the movement against Cop City, said that Georgia “was so hellbent on criminalizing a protest movement that was strong, resilient and popularly-supported … [it] decided to use the law as a political tool.”

Brown compared the case to the so-called J20 protesters, more than 200 of whom were arrested at a 2017 protest in Washington, targeting Donald Trump's first presidential inauguration. They faced felony riot and conspiracy charges of conspiracy. In a case drawn out over more than a year, the state was found to have withheld evidence as well as committing other irregularities. Ultimately, nearly all the cases were dismissed, and only one person served jail time.

“We see examples of prosecutorial overreach in highly politicized cases,” Brown said.

Farmer's decision makes the Cop City case “probably the highest-profile failure of using conspiracy charges to indict a protest movement”, he added.

Brown said the two cases also have in common that defendants stuck together, and didn't “point fingers” at each other for plea deals. “In a political movement” like this, he said, “people care about each other”.

Will Potter, author of the recently released Little Red Barns, a decade-long investigation of factory farms and fascism, said the lessons of the case could be important under Trump's second term, which has seen the US slide towards authoritarianism.

“The playbook–stretching laws like Rico to cast dissent as organized crime won't vanish, especially amid a surge of authoritarian and openly fascist politics,” Potter said.

Trump isn't even trying to hide his authoritarianism within social acceptability.

U.S. democracy has always been fragile, and we are now witnessing its dismantlement.

The rising tide of political violence poses one threat to democracy in this country, but another quieter threat is also hard at work via the erosion of free speech and critical thinking, both of which are necessary for a flourishing democracy.

Trump's book bans and attacks on opposing political ideas, the blocking of independent journalism, the intimidation of news organizations, and the defunding of public media are all part of this erosion. These attacks are neither accidental nor incidental, but systematic and dangerously consequential to this country. 

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Trump's regime is driven by a form of authoritarian control (both political and military), disinformation, and a blatant disrespect for the U.S. Constitution. He has ushered in policies rooted in forms of fascism, where the act of dominating the people is articulated and enforced as “common sense.”

The concept of hegemony helps to capture what this regime is attempting to accomplish — or is in fact accomplishing. Hegemony, within the current U.S. context, captures what I see as an unmitigated criminal process of domination.

In this exclusive interview, education scholar Stephen Brookfield offers clarity on the concept of hegemony, how it is linked to white supremacy and authoritarianism, and how critical education and educators can mount a necessary form of resistance. Brookfield is an adjunct professor at Columbia University Teachers College in New York and professor emeritus at the University of St. Thomas in Minneapolis-St. Paul. His goal is to help people (including himself) identify and challenge the dominant ideologies they have internalized. Brookfield is the author, co-author, or editor of 21 books, including Becoming a White Antiracist (with Mary Hess), Teaching Race, and The Handbook of Race and Adult Education (with Vanessa Sheared, Juanita Johnson-Bailey, Elizabeth Peterson & Scipio A. J. Colin III). The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

George Yancy: Define hegemony and explain how it is negatively related to processes of education and learning.

Stephen Brookfield: Hegemony exists when a set of ideas that claim to explain how the world works, and the associated practices linked to these, sustain a particular social order. The question to be asked about hegemony is: Whose interests does it serve? Is it an unrepresentative minority whose position is bolstered by the widespread acceptance of these ideas and practices? Or does this hegemony reflect and promote the interests of the wider majority? Hegemony is always being contested as groups within a society constantly try to promote their own interests. When hegemony is most successfully in place, there is no need for paramilitary control because people have internalized the dominant ideology so completely that they police their own conduct. And, as Michel Foucault pointed out, they often take sensuous pleasure in doing so.

In the United States right now, there is a clear attempt to create a hegemony based on particular ideologies. One of these is monopoly capitalism, hidden behind the valorization of free-market enterprise as the best guarantor of freedom and liberty. Another is patriarchy. A third is white supremacy, the belief that European settlers “tamed” and “civilized” a continent, and that their “superior intelligence” and capacity for clear decision-making helped create the greatest nation on Earth. Mixed into this combustible cocktail is authoritarianism, the belief that a strong leader is needed who brooks no dissent from their vision and policies, and whose certainty appeals strongly to those confused by the maelstrom of forces they see swirling around their individual lives. Erich Fromm's work outlined this dynamic beautifully three-quarters of a century ago.

At the heart of a successful state hegemony is control of what Louis Althusser called ideological state apparatuses. One of these is education. Control the curriculum and you control the range of ideas that people are exposed to. This is why schooling is inherently political. In earlier parts of my career, I had colleagues who disagreed with me on this point. Now I don't know anyone who disputes it. Early pointers of this hegemony were Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis's targeting of New College of Florida, and the federal abolition of critical race theory as a term used in federal training programs. As the current administration hits its stride, we have revisionist history in place that erases any analysis of slavery. Add to this the targeted removal of any institutional practice or office that mentions the words diversity, equity, or inclusion (DEI); the ridicule of anything that describes itself as “anti-racist” as “woke”; and targeted lawsuits aimed at any university that resists these restrictions — and we have the clear attempt to install white supremacy as an official, state-approved ideology.

Antonio Gramsci, whose work is usually associated with the term hegemony, was particularly focused on how cultural mechanisms enforce a certain picture of the world. As Fox News moved to occupy an important place in U.S. TV networks and right-wing radio and podcasts gathered steam, white supremacy, patriarchy, and authoritarianism were all fully legitimized and reinforced as “sensible” ways to order society. The betrothal of the Trump administration to right-wing media is consummated by senior cabinet and advisory positions being filled by pundits drawn from these sources.

The overt nature of this attempt to create hegemony is striking. There is no need to hide authoritarian control behind socially acceptable signifiers. The stream of billionaires traveling to kiss the ring of the president shows just how far business has caved.

Black history is under attack. Through a right-wing hegemonic retelling of Black history, where the reality of the brutality of anti-Blackness is being erased, memory is being controlled by those who would rather tell a pleasing lie than face the horrors of truth. While there was important pushback, I recall that a group of Texas educators had proposed to the Texas State Board of Education that slavery should be taught in second grade social studies as “involuntary relocation.” Or think about the Florida Board of Education and its approval to teach middle school students “that enslaved people gained a ‘personal benefit' from the skills they learned under slavery before the Civil War.” My sense is that partly undergirding this attempt to whitewash and rewrite the brutality of anti-Blackness within the U.S. is the aim to maintain a history and ideology of “white innocence.” Given your important work on whiteness, explain how the meta-narrative of white innocence is part of the core of what Trump is up to. 

George W. Bush said that the worst moment of his presidency was not 9/11 or leading the country into an invasion that killed hundreds of thousands in Iraq. Instead, it was being called a racist after his administration's lackluster response to Hurricane Katrina. This shows the deep-rooted belief held by many white people that we are essentially racially innocent. Sure, our ancestors may have enslaved people, but that was what was considered culturally appropriate at the time, and anyway it has no relation to who we are today. We treat others as we would want to be treated, we don't make judgments about the content of character based on skin color, and we treat people of color with goodwill. So how can we be racist? This act of self-congratulation is a common signifier of white innocence.

“Control the curriculum and you control the range of ideas that people are exposed to. This is why schooling is inherently political.”

Innocence is a delightfully complex term, something that is often projected as a desirable state to which we should aspire, but also something that suggests a certain childlike naivete. Recently, the protestation of white innocence has become weaponized as a response to the Black Lives Matter movement and the anti-racist momentum that built in the wake of George Floyd's murder. This weaponization has multiple dimensions. First, there is the reinterpretation of colonialism and imperialism as a generally innocent and beneficent phenomenon in which the supposed improvements conferred (instilling morality, religious conversion, and an adherence to European values) far outweigh any unfortunate mistakes such as genocide and slavery. Second, we have the contemporary claim that even if some bad things were done in the past, that has nothing to do with anything that's happening today. The strident rejection of white guilt is one aspect of this; as is the belief that referring to the history of slavery and settlement is a “woke” device that folks of color use to blame their situation on the past, thereby ignoring their need to take personal responsibility for their lives and work harder.

A deeper sense of innocence is that which Shannon Sullivan describes as the innocence of “good white people.” This is the innocent belief in our essential humanity, in our commitment to “treating people as we find them,” in our subscription to the color-blind viewpoint, and in our belief that we act out of the best possible motivations. Under white innocence, the sincerity of our actions is what matters the most and “justifies” any unintended harm we might commit.

This describes a worldview that I internalized early on in life and that still resides within me. One way that structural inequity stays in place is by the majority assuming that a level playing field exists so that we interact as equals unaffected by history. In this worldview, the past does not matter, and structural barriers are overcome by exercising goodwill. Under white innocence, words and actions that came from a “good place” cannot be viewed as racist, owing to the purity of their intentions. If we are told that we have behaved or spoken in a racist way, we apologize. But in our hearts lies the unspoken conviction that really the other person was being overly sensitive. Or, that they've misinterpreted a beneficent communication and taken offense at imagined slights that were really not there. In this way, innocence regards racism as an unfortunate problem of miscommunication owing to what we call “cultural differences.”

As the current administration systematically defunds any institutional efforts to address racism, those who were made uncomfortable in the past by DEI programs can now breathe a sigh of relief. In their minds, we are back to “normal.” Balance has been restored after a period of whites being unfairly blamed for colluding in white supremacy.

If you recall, in George Orwell's 1984, the dystopian Party can control what people think and do. In fact, in that book, the belief that “2 + 2 = 5” is taken as true and is indicative of the extent to which political power can be used to brainwash people. Fascism works to create a world where what is blatantly false has become what is deemed “common sense” and “true.” Under Trump's neo-fascist regime, we must fight against the perpetuation of systematic falsehoods and ideologies of distraction. You argue that the process of “doing ideology critique involves adults learning to become aware of how ideology lives within them as well as understanding how it buttresses the structures of the outside world that works against them.” Understanding and deploying the concept of ideology critique is indispensable at this moment. Explain ways in which teachers in schools and universities might use ideology critique to contest the attempt by the right wing to accept blatant falsehoods as “commonsense wisdom.”

One of the greatest challenges in my teaching has been to work out how to get students to think structurally; that is, how they learn to realize that their individual actions are framed by their social location and that wider economic forces and dominant ideologies constrain the options they consider. The ideology of individualism, so lauded throughout the history of the U.S., is a major barrier to this task. It posits life's journey as one of grit, determination, and struggle in the face of barriers that are unexpectedly thrown up to block the realization of our full potential.

I am not a rigid economic materialist. I don't believe that individual choice is purely a comforting myth, and I do believe that individual consciousness is, ultimately, inexplicable. Chance, unpredictability, and serendipity are powerful elements of the human condition. But our choices are fueled by the ideological oxygen we breathe. Ideological state apparatuses such as education and religion, official government policies and statements, and the daily bath in social media present the range of possibilities that we view as both desirable and realistic. When a government controls the flow of information and intimidates schools and media outlets into legitimizing their worldview, then hegemony becomes easier to establish.

The key as an educator is to find a way to interrupt this dominant ideological narrative. In adult education, a great deal of attention has been paid to what the transformative learning theorist Jack Mezirow called “disorienting dilemmas.” These are the moments when our settled expectations about how the world works are thrown into confusion. Examples would be facing an unexpected health crisis and finding care unavailable, being fired after a history of professionalism and assiduously working to achieve institutional goals, or being conscripted to fight in a war. For George W. Bush, it was being called “racist.”

“As the current administration systematically defunds any institutional efforts to address racism, those who were made uncomfortable in the past by DEI programs can now breathe a sigh of relief. In their minds, we are back to ‘normal.'”

As we negotiate our response to being caught in such dilemmas, we are brought face-to-face with our paradigmatic assumptions. As we realize that these assumptions are flawed, we are forced to examine why we believed them to be so accurate in the first place. We seek other, more satisfactory meaning schemes and perspectives that make more sense.

In the classroom, teachers need to create disorienting dilemmas that unsettle and confound our students' expectations. And, as we do so, we need to judge how much dissonance can be tolerated. Too much, and we risk them dismissing our activities as unrealistic. Too little, and we allow them to stay comfortable. In ideology critique, I present a cultural or institutional action that seems benign and desirable and then ask students to answer several questions about it: What assumptions are embedded in the practice? What is it intended to achieve? Whose interests does the practice serve? Who is most harmed by it? Why do those who benefit not recognize the harm it creates? How could the action be reimagined in ways that were fairer or socially just?

A similar approach is to institute equity pauses as a required element in decision-making across a university. As program changes are made, admissions criteria altered, and curricula revised, we need to pause very deliberately before deciding on a particular course of action and ask the ideology critique questions above.

We also need teachers and institutional leaders to model the practice of critical reflection. White leaders need to talk publicly about their own struggle to recognize that they have a racial identity, and to acknowledge the benefits this brings. This kind of disclosure needs to become normalized, so that discussions of racism are not prefaced by a collective intake of fearful inhalation. Neither should it be confessional, in which whites purge themselves of the sin of racism by asking absolution from colleagues of color. And courses need to be taught by racially mixed teams who can model what a difficult racial conversation looks like — stilted, characterized both by periods of uncomfortable silence, and also displaying strong emotions and feelings.

In my own capacity as a philosopher and a teacher, I have attempted to model what it means to engage in critical reflection. Indeed, critical reflection is inextricably linked to critical pedagogy. But what we are witnessing is the very opposite of critical reflection. In The Power of Critical Theory: Liberating Adult Learning and Teaching, you describe the problematic process of creating what you call “adult educators as professional ideologists.” What will education in the U.S. look like as “adult educators as professional ideologists” continue to gain traction? And what are the larger implications for U.S. democracy? 

I have argued that critical reflection focuses on power and hegemony — on understanding how and when an elite group uses power in an authoritarian way to impose its cultural hegemony on the majority of people. It also reveals the tricks of ideological manipulation that result in people voting enthusiastically for politicians whose actions and decisions end up harming those same voters — and then continuing to do it over and over again.

Adult education as political detoxification seeks to remove the addictive chemicals of white innocence from our consciousness. It demonstrates the falsity of believing that we all act on a level playing field, or the naivete of thinking that our actions are motivated solely by a humanist concern for everyone to get along. It unmasks power.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

MOSCOW, September 13. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the contributions of Muscovites to the successful conduct of the special military operation.

"Tens of thousands of Muscovites are fighting valiantly on the front lines. As has happened many times in history, Moscow has become a strong supporter of the Russian army. More than 500 Moscow enterprises are producing critical products for the front. Injured soldiers receive treatment and rehabilitation in the capital's hospitals. Hundreds of Moscow specialists, including doctors, special services employees, builders, and managers, provide daily assistance to residents of Donbass and Novorossiya," Putin said.

Aaron Judge walked out at Fenway Park on Friday night knowing that just one home run would see him overtake Joe DiMaggio and move into fourth outright on the New York Yankees' all-time list.
    


            He wasted no time.
    


            The two-time American League MVP jumped on the second pitch he saw – a fastball from Lucas Giolito – and crushed his 362nd career homer 468 feet over the Green Monster on the way to a 4-1 win over the Boston Red Sox.
    


            Only Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle and Lou Gehrig have hit more home runs in the pinstripes than Judge.
    


            “It's special, but just like all those guys in front of me and on those lists, they weren't playing for records. They were playing to win,” Judge said after Friday's game, per MLB.com. “So I'm just trying to follow in their footsteps. I'm here to win. I'm trying to help put this team in the best possible position every single night.”
    


            It's been quite the week for Judge. The 33-year-old only overtook Yogi Berra for home runs on Tuesday, disrupting a top five of Ruth, Mantle, Gehrig, DiMaggio and Berra which had stood since 1966.
    


            Judge's home run numbers don't lie – he is the Yankees' best slugger since the 1960s.
    


            The 33-year-old has not only cracked the franchise's top five, but he has also done so with considerably fewer at-bats than his peers. With a rate of 0.09 home runs per plate appearance, only Ruth – with the same rate – can really rival Judge in terms of slugging efficiency.
    


New York Yankees' Aaron Judge reaches 300 career home runs faster than anyone in MLB history



            Judge's career batting average of .292 is very good, but is joint 25th on the Yankees' all-time list, some way off the .349 and .340 achieved by Ruth and Gehrig, respectively.
    


            Nonetheless, his on-base percentage ranks fourth, a mark of just how scared pitchers have been of Judge during his decade at the plate.
    


            If you want to dive deeper into the statistics, Judge ranks excellently in WAR (Wins Above Replacement), the metric that estimates the number of wins a player adds to a team compared to the average “replacement-level” player.
    


            The metric has Judge in sixth place among Yankees position players, behind Ruth, Gehrig, Mantle, DiMaggio, and Derek Jeter.
    


            But to focus so much on their individual numbers is to miss one crucial detail. Nine of the top 10 players for WAR in franchise history have won at least one World Series title in the pinstripes. Yogi Berra won 10.
    


            The one who has not is Judge. That is not entirely his fault, of course – the team has only made the World Series once in his career, last year's loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games.
    


            But the California native struggled throughout the postseason and had just one hit and seven strikeouts across the first three World Series games.
    


            When the loss was eventually confirmed, Judge found himself in a reflective mood.
    


            “I think falling short in the World Series will stick with me until I die, probably,” he told reporters.
    


            “Just like every other loss, those things don't go away. They're battle scars along the way, and hopefully when my career is over we've got a lot of battle scars but hopefully a lot of victories along the way too.”
    


            While his own personal legacy may not have been at the forefront of his mind in that moment, Judge will have known that, without a World Series title to his name, it is difficult to consider him alongside Ruth, Mantle, Gehrig, DiMaggio and Jeter.
    


            He will also know, however, that his first-inning homer against the Red Sox on Friday propelled the Yankees to a 1.5-game lead over Boston, and a much better shot at home-field advantage in the Wild Card round.
    


            Win a World Series this year, and we can start to talk about Judge among the very best hitters in Yankees history.

Marina Ramazashvili says son, Giorgi Bachiashvili, was the victim of a ‘vendetta' by billionaire politician

The mother of a jailed former aide to Bidzina Ivanishvili has accused the de facto leader of Georgia of treating her son as his “personal prisoner” as she appealed to the west for help.

Marina Ramazashvili, a renowned ophthalmologist in Georgia, said Giorgi Bachiashvili, who has allegedly been beaten in his prison cell, was the victim of a “vendetta” waged by the billionaire politician.

The Georgian government, led by Ivanishvili, has been accused of slipping into autocracy, with the courts and the prosecution service increasingly under political control.

“Maybe he is evil,” Ramazashvili, 65, said of Ivanishvili. “He has no humanity, he has no empathy. My only hope is the European institutions. Giorgi is now Ivanishvili's personal prisoner. I ask, for someone to help, please”.

Bachiashvili fled Georgia earlier this year after falling out with Ivanishvili, the honorary chair of the country's ruling party, for whom he worked as a “right hand man” for a decade.

At the time that he skipped the country for Abu Dhabi, Bachiashvili was on trial for allegedly stealing $42m (£31m) in cryptocurrency from the billionaire politician.

Bachiashvili, who vehemently denied the allegations, claimed in an interview with the Guardian from his hideaway in the Gulf state that the prosecution was punishment for his outspoken criticism of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

He further claimed that Ivanishvili – who has guided a shift away from the west and towards Russia – may have concluded he was a western spy.

Transparency International has described the case against Bachiashvili as being “devoid of both legal and factual grounds”.

Soon after the interview, Bachiashvili was seized outside a hotel where he had been meeting his lawyer by men who said they were from Interpol.

He was taken to a police station in Abu Dhabi and then on to Dubai. Within 48 hours, the then 39-year-old was deported without a hearing via a Georgian Airways flight with a bag over his head, his lawyers claim.

Bachiashvili alleged that one of the five other passengers on the flight to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, was the head of Georgia's security services.

He was taunted during the flight for his belief that he could escape lvanishvili's reach, his lawyers claim.

The Georgian government subsequently issued a press statement in which it claimed it had found and arrested Bachiashvili near the border with Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Ramazashvili said that she had not been allowed to speak to her son since June but that she had learned from his lawyers that he had been badly beaten in his cell on 11 July, two days before his 40th birthday.

A man who did not appear to be a prisoner had repeatedly smashed Bachiashvili's head against the wall and bit him on the shoulder. During the altercation, he briefly lost consciousness, it is claimed.

“They are trying to break him every day,” said Ramazashvili. “They even have new rules. The parliament adopted a law that if someone is found guilty of financial misconduct the authorities can ban him from leaving the country for 16 years.”

Bachiashvili is facing 11 years in jail after being convicted of stealing the cryptocurrency but the prosecution is seeking to add further years to his sentence for absconding.

Prosecutors are also seeking a further jail term for Bachiashvili's alleged negligence in overseeing a state investment in a hydro-power station. Ivanishvili has separately launched a civil case against him.

Ramazashvili said it had been through treating Ivanishvilli and his family as patients that her son was first introduced and then began working for the businessman who at the time had companies in Russia.

She said: “As a person, he was very normal, very kind. I cannot tell anything bad about him, or of members of his family, for that. Because of this, I thought that Giorgi will be very safe … This is my greatest mistake in my life.”

Georgia continues to have aspirations to join the EU and it has recently submitted a response from Brussels demands for a series of reforms after claims that the country was sliding into autocracy.

Ramazashvili, who is now living in the US state of Alabama, said she had been left bereft and that her only hope was that international institutions, such as the European court of human rights or the UN would intervene.

“I have nothing inside,” she said.

People in at least eight states have been infected with Chagas, new report says, amid low awareness of disease

In February, Luna donated blood at her high school in Miami, with the goal of helping save others.

“She was very proud to come home and say, ‘I gave blood today,'” her mother, Valerie, said. (The Guardian is not using the mother or daughter's full names to protect their privacy.)

It turned out, she was not able to save someone else's life but potentially prevented herself from having serious health issues.

A couple months later, she received a letter from the blood donation company informing her that she could not give blood. She had tested positive for Chagas disease, which is caused by a parasite spread by triatomine bugs, otherwise known as kissing bugs.

Neither Luna nor Valerie had heard about the disease, which is most common in rural parts of Mexico and Central and South America, where their family had traveled.

“If you get a letter that tells you, you have blood cancer, you know what it is. But when you receive a letter and you hear, ‘Oh, your daughter has Chagas,' … you're like, oh, what is this?” said Valerie.

Dr Norman Beatty, who has studied the kissing bugs, said that like Valerie and Luna, most people in the US have not heard of Chagas, even though it is not just present south of the border but within the country.

Beatty, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Florida College of Medicine, is part of a group of scientists that authored a new report arguing that the United States should treat Chagas as an endemic disease, meaning that there is a constant or usual prevalence of a disease or infectious agent in a population within a geographic area.

They hope to increase public awareness of Chagas, which while rare, can cause serious health problems.

“My hope is that with more awareness of Chagas, we can build a better infrastructure around helping others understand whether or not they are at risk of this disease” and cause people to think about it similarly to other vector-borne illnesses, like from mosquitoes and ticks, said Beatty. “We need to add kissing bugs to this list.”

Bugs spread the parasite through their droppings, which can infect humans if they enter the body through a cut or via the eyes or mouth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue and eyelid swelling in the weeks or months after infection.

Some people, like Luna, do not develop any symptoms – at least initially – but about 20 to 30% of people infected can develop chronic issues later in life such as an enlarged heart and heart failure, or an enlarged esophagus or colon, leading to trouble eating or going to the bathroom.

About 8 million people, including 280,000 in the United States, have the disease, according to the CDC.

It is not a recent arrival to the US. The 1,200-year-old remains of a man buried in south Texas revealed that he had Chagas and an abnormally-enlarged colon, according to a report in the Gastroenterology journal.

More recently, human development in new areas has brought us “closer to the kissing bugs' natural environment”, Beatty said.

People in at least eight states have been infected with Chagas from local bugs, according to the new report, which was published in the CDC's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.

But the fact that it has not been declared endemic to the United States has led to “low awareness and underreporting”, the report states.

A 2010 survey conducted of some American Medical Association providers found that 19% of infectious disease doctors had never heard of Chagas and 27% said they were “not at all confident,” in their knowledge of the disease being up to date.

“If you ask physicians about Chagas, they would think that it is either something transmitted by ticks … or they would say that's something that doesn't exist in the US,” said Dr Bernardo Moreno Peniche, a physician and anthropologist who was one of the authors of the report with Beatty.

But Beatty sees people with Chagas every week at a clinic in Florida dedicated to travel medicine and tropical diseases. (Those patients were infected with Chagas in Latin America.)

Beatty said there is a misconception that tests for Chagas are not reliable or available in the United States.

“We have the infrastructure to start screening people who have had exposure to these bugs and who may be in a region where we had known transmission, so we should be thinking about this as kind of routine care,” Beatty said.

After Valerie received the letter about Luna's infection, she contacted her pediatrician who quickly responded and told them to see an infectious disease doctor.

That physician told them it was likely a “false positive” and ordered additional tests before eventually starting treatment, Valerie said.

Frustrated by the medical care, Valerie sought out a new physician and found Beatty, who prescribed a different anti-parasitic therapy.

Even among people like Luna who are not experiencing any symptoms, such treatment is often recommended, Beatty said.

The goal is to “detect early and treat early to avoid the chronic, often permanent damage that can occur”, Beatty explained.

The treatment took two months, during which Luna experienced side effects like hives and severe swelling in her hands and feet, she said.

While she is finished with the treatment, there is no definitive test to determine whether such patients will develop chronic Chagas symptoms, but it's less likely, Beatty said.

“I hope the CDC takes it seriously,” Valerie said, “and that we can move forward and have good awareness, so that people want to be tested and get tested and get the treatment they need.”

			Washington is coming to terms with the fact Tyler Robinson, the prime suspect in murder of the conservative activist, is one of its own

In southern Utah, it's said there are more churches than traffic lights. Known as “red-rock country”, hulking, ferrous mesas rise from the earth to form a Martian-looking basin, in the middle of which lies the city of Washington.

The settlement of identikit stucco houses dotted with Mormon churches feels in many ways like the edge of the earth. “There's nothing to do out here except play golf,” said one taxi driver.

Yet on Friday, this sleepy urban sprawl was transformed into the broadcasting hub of the US, after the FBI revealed that Charlie Kirk's suspected assassin was one of their own.

College dropout Tyler Robinson, 22, was arrested on Thursday night and is expected to be charged with murder.

Mr Robinson's confession brought to an end a two-day manhunt, after Kirk, an influential conservative activist and key Donald Trump ally, was shot dead on Wednesday, aged 31, while addressing a crowd of 3,000 students at Utah Valley University.

The gunman fired a single lethal shot from 142 yards, before jumping off a roof overlooking the pop-up stage where Kirk was hosting one of his hugely popular “Prove Me Wrong” sessions, debating students on conservative issues.

The killing has reverberated across the US, sparking furious online debates around freedom of speech and fears of rising Left-wing radicalism.

On the middle-class street where Mr Robinson grew up, 260 miles south of where Kirk was killed, the once-quiet neighbourhood was abuzz with camera crews. Reporters jostled for quotes from bewildered residents struggling to come to terms with how their peaceful suburb had become the focus of a nationwide manhunt.

“For something of global impact on our nation to happen in your neighbourhood – it's wild,” said one man.

The scene had become an attraction for a crop of local teenagers, excited to get a picture outside the murder suspect's house.

A police car stood watch, warding off all who approached. Yet the $600,000 (£443,000) six-bedroom property itself was unremarkable, save for a back garden overrun with weeds and building equipment.

The only sign of the trauma that lay within was a gleaming nickel Dodge Challenger parked in the driveway – the car the suspect used to make his getaway from the college campus.

The eldest of three brothers, Mr Robinson's social media shows him smiling with neatly combed hair and wearing a buttoned-up shirt: the picture of an all-American son.

His mother, Amber, works in healthcare for the disabled, according to her Facebook profile. His father, Matt, was a longstanding member of the local sheriff's department. Both were registered Republicans, voting records show.

It therefore remains something of a mystery how this young man who aced his high school exams, winning a $32,000 scholarship to Utah State University, turned into the main suspect in a high-profile murder.

Few answers were provided by neighbours, who painted a picture of a family somewhat isolated from their local community.

“They're private people,” said Gerrett Merrick, 78. The retired postal worker, who shares a back garden fence with the Robinsons, said he'd only seen the boys “three or four times in 10 years”.

The Robinsons, like many in Utah, are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with their eldest son becoming a member “at a young age”, church officials confirmed. However, neighbours said they did not attend.

Another local, who lives across from the family, said he had spoken to Mr Robinson's father, Matthew, only “three times in the last 20 years” when collecting his mail.

It is equally unclear how a man from a Republican family developed such a visceral hatred for Kirk, a Right-wing firebrand.

Clues may lie in his decision to drop out of college after one semester and instead enrol at Dixie Technical College as an electrical apprentice.

A family member told the FBI that he had grown increasingly political “in recent years,” and, at a recent family dinner, had accused Kirk of “spreading hate”.

Yet unbeknown to those around him, Mr Robinson appears to have been radicalised, engraving messages on the weapon he allegedly used to kill Kirk, such as: “Hey fascist! Catch!”

Utah may be a ruby-red state, but politics is not a subject often brought up in the Latter-day Saints community, neighbours said.

“We have our opinions, we keep our politics to ourselves,” Kristin Schwiermann, who has lived on the Robinsons' street for 16 years, told USA Today.

Others worried that politics is becoming an insurmountable source of division in the US. Leeta Willoughby, 36, said: “Families have been torn apart by [it]. Seeing everyone arguing all the time on social media, it's like the nation's in distress.”

It was Mr Robinson's own father, encouraged by a church minister, who brought an end to the two-day manhunt by convincing his son to turn himself in.

“Tyler, is this you? This looks like you,” he asked his son, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN. 

Robinson told his father that he would rather kill himself than turn himself in, but his father was able to persuade him to confide in a youth pastor who works with the Washington County Sheriff's Office.

Melissa Tait, 55, whose children went to the same high school as Mr Robinson, said she was “so thankful” to the family for their actions.

“That had to be an unbelievable decision and I hope all of us parents would do the same,” she said. “I have the utmost sympathy for his family.”

Worse still, when allegations surfaced of their son's horrific crimes, the Robinsons were already grieving another tragedy.

Easton Robinson, the suspect's cousin, died just weeks ago in a freak motorcycle accident, according to locals.

Debbie Robinson, their grandmother, was not home on Friday, but a neighbour said she was having “a hard time with the loss of that grandson”. “She's probably very emotional right now,” the neighbour added.

A short drive away at the Red Cliffs Temple – the tallest building for miles around – Latter-day Saints bishops consoled churchgoers left devastated by a killing that has frayed the fabric of their community.

“As hard as it probably was for the family, I feel they did the right thing,” said a church brother. “This horrible act that has taken place, it goes against what we teach and what we believe.

“But I pray for him too, actually, and for his family. I do.”

Ernest Oppenheimer, who founded the Anglo American mining empire in 1917, became so fabulously wealthy that he would sometimes casually slip a diamond into the palms of the wives of his business friends after dinner parties at his lavish Brenthurst estate in Johannesburg.

The son of a German cigar merchant, he built a sprawling network of companies in South Africa's gold reefs and diamond fields. He and his son Harry ruled the country's economy at a time when South Africa dominated the global mining sector, making Anglo American one of the world's biggest and most powerful corporations.

For decades, even in the depths of the apartheid era, Anglo American Corp. was the symbol of South Africa's mining might. And then, facing new struggles and losses, it became something else: a symbol of the slow decline of the country's mineral industry as costs soared, mines closed, production dropped and investors relocated.

Today the iconic Anglo American brand is on the verge of disappearing forever, merging with Teck Resources Ltd. to become a new US$50-billion entity, Anglo Teck. The new company will be headquartered in Vancouver, with most of its top executives moving to Canada.

While the Teck transaction could be a lifeline for the 108-year-old company, it represents yet another setback for South Africa, whose former mining giants are increasingly focused elsewhere in the world.

South Africa's political and business elites seem resigned to the latest move. The government issued no statements about it this week. Anglo had already moved its headquarters to London in 1999, spinning off its gold mines into a separate company and maintaining only a secondary listing in Johannesburg.

While Anglo still controls several major assets in South Africa – including the diamond mines of De Beers and the country's biggest iron ore producer, Kumba Iron Ore – the company has long preferred to chase copper projects in Latin America, a trend that will accelerate if the merger is approved. After recently spinning off its South African platinum assets, Anglo is now seeking even to divest from De Beers itself if it can find a buyer.

South Africa's state-owned Public Investment Corp., one of the biggest single shareholders in Anglo with a reported 8-per-cent stake, was actively opposed to an attempt by BHP to purchase the company last year. South African Mining Minister Gwede Mantashe strongly criticized the BHP takeover bid. But both have been muted on the latest deal, implicitly suggesting that they support the Anglo-Teck transaction.

South African media have reported the Teck deal in neutral terms, seeing it as just another example in the country's marginalization in the global mining sector. “The latest deal should benefit Anglo's SA shareholders,” the respected Business Day newspaper said in an editorial. “But it is another loss for mining in SA.”

Anglo CEO Duncan Wanblad has tried to reassure South Africans by insisting that the company has “an enduring commitment” to the country and its “national priorities,” despite the planned relocation of its headquarters to British Columbia. He pledged that the new company would include South Africans on its board and executive team, and he promised financial contributions to the country's junior mining exploration fund. He also declared that Kumba Iron Ore will remain “core and pivotal” to the merged company.

What does the massive Anglo Teck deal mean for the future of mining in Canada?

But the reality is that South Africa's mining industry is in relentless decline, and Anglo's long history in the country is fading.

Once the biggest gold producer in the world, South Africa now ranks just 12th, behind countries such as Mali and Uzbekistan, according to the World Gold Council. As a destination for mining investment, it now ranks 68th among the 82 jurisdictions covered in the latest survey of investment attractiveness by the Fraser Institute.

A century ago, foreign investors were much more intrigued by South Africa's mining prospects. Ernest Oppenheimer collected capital from British and U.S. financiers, including Herbert Hoover and J.P. Morgan, to help him create Anglo American, its name reflecting the nationalities of its main funders. (He briefly contemplated calling it “African-American Corp.” until the idea was sharply rejected by his U.S. partners.)

The company soon grew into a leviathan. Ernest and Harry Oppenheimer were often listed among the world's wealthiest people. They developed lucrative gold fields in the Orange Free State and the Witwatersrand, branched into diamond and coal mines, and then sank money into steel, insurance, banks, newspapers, pulp and paper, property development, platinum, copper, uranium and iron ore. Critics called it “the Octopus.”

Opinion: With Anglo American at its side, Teck's mission to become a pure critical metals company takes a hit

De Beers, founded by Cecil Rhodes, was acquired by Ernest Oppenheimer in the late 1920s after a protracted board battle. The Oppenheimers turned it into a global cartel, controlling the world diamond trade. In 1947, their ad agency created the slogan “A Diamond is Forever” – still considered the greatest marketing tagline of the 20th century − and the company soared into the stratosphere.

In 1961, Anglo acquired a major Canadian company, Hudson Bay Mining, and then continued to expand internationally. By the 1980s, the Oppenheimer empire contained more than 650 companies, employed more than 800,000 people and controlled the majority of all stocks traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.

Harry Oppenheimer was more progressive than some of his rival tycoons in South Africa. He criticized apartheid and supported the creation of trade unions at Anglo's mines. But he also benefited from apartheid, which entrenched an exploitative system of cheap labour from migrant Black mineworkers, making his mines more profitable. During a 1987 strike by a mineworkers union – led by Cyril Ramaphosa, today the President of South Africa − Anglo sacked about 45,000 labourers.

After moving its headquarters to London in 1999, Anglo failed to keep pace with the world's top mining conglomerates, reflecting the decline of South Africa's mining sector. But South Africa has maintained its global influence in one key area: It provides many of the geologists, managers and executives who dominate the mining sector around the world, including in Canada.

One of Canada's mining giants, Barrick Mining Corp., is headed by a South African CEO, Mark Bristow. And if the latest merger is approved, Anglo Teck's CEO will be Mr. Wanblad – another South African.

Teck Resources' Highland Valley Copper Mine near Logan Lake, B.C., in September, 2025.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

In the 21-page news release outlining the merger of Vancouver's Teck Resources TECK-B-T and London's Anglo American NGLOY, Glencore is not mentioned once. Yet the Swiss commodities giant will play a crucial role in determining whether the deal goes ahead and, if so, under which terms. 

In the global mining industry, Glencore GLNCY is famous – make that infamous – as a merciless negotiator and will no doubt employ its leverage to the hilt. Anglo and Teck, beware.

Driving the creation of Anglo Teck, as the enlarged company is to be called, are two enormous copper mines high in the Andes of Northern Chile, Quebrada Blanca (QB) and Collahuasi. They are only 11 kilometres apart, and putting the two together in the name of “synergies” – business argot for cost-cutting – is driving the proposed marriage. The companies claim that melding those operations would boost collective operating income by US$1.4-billion a year.

Opinion: With Anglo American at its side, Teck's mission to become a pure critical metals company takes a hit

Operating QB and Collahuasi as one makes perfect strategic sense; the two mines had already been co-operating in small ways (they share an airport, and QB sells desalinated water to the Collahuasi mill). But the complex ownership structure of the mines means a full-fledged merger could get bogged down in negotiations – or worse. 

QB is 60-per-cent owned by Teck, 30 per cent by Japan's Sumitomo SMMYY and 10 per cent by Coldeco, Chile's state-owned mining company. The much larger Collahuasi – its pit is 3.5 kilometres across and a kilometre deep – is 44-per-cent owned by Anglo, 44 per cent by Glencore and 12 per cent by Japan's Mitsui MITSY. In other words, Anglo and Teck will have to make nice with four other shareholders of the mines to get their deal done, and one of them, Glencore, has as much power to determine Collahuasi's future as Anglo. 

Glencore, on its own and through Collahuasi, has for years been touting the benefits of combining the mines and has even shown slides to visitors to illustrate how that could create “opportunities for industrial strategies” (I saw this presentation in January at the mine site). 

Analysis: Teck Resources justified its takeover to shareholders – but not to Canadians

Collahuasi's idea is to build a conveyor belt to take its richer ore to QB's mill, leaving QB's own ore in the ground until it's needed, perhaps decades down the road. Much of the rest of the infrastructure would be shared, including the Pacific port facilities, where the water is desalinated and ships are loaded with copper concentrate bound for refineries in Asia. 

You would think that Glencore and Mitsui would be thrilled that their Collahuasi partner wants to merge the two mines. Anglo does all the heavy lifting, and Glencore and Mitsui share the synergies – money for nothing, merger for free. 

It's not that simple. The logical merger structure would see the two mines come under one company, perhaps a joint venture, that would be owned by all the shareholders, with Anglo Teck having the single biggest piece. Or not. Putting values on the individual equity stakes of all six partners is where the negotiations could bog down.

Each of the six would want to maximize their equity stakes in QB-Collahuasi to boost their share of the profits. But Teck is, in effect, being rescued by Anglo because QB, its biggest project, has gone billions of dollars over budget and suffered endless engineering problems and production delays. Also, QB's ore grade is relatively low, making it harder for the mine to turn into a cash flow machine. The average grade, 0.52 per cent per tonne of ore mined, compares badly with Collahuasi's 0.8 per cent.

High Teck: The Canadian miner bets its future on a copper mine in the Atacama Desert

You can see where this is going. Glencore and Mitsui – especially Glencore, with its aggressive executive team, led by CEO Gary Nagle – will want to minimize the value of QB, all the better to boost its own equity stake in the new company that will hold both mines. The smaller the value assigned to QB, the higher the value assigned to Collahuasi. It's that simple. 

Of course, Glencore has to be wary of pushing its luck. If it argues that QB is worth zero, or close to it, Anglo and Teck could throw up their hands in despair and call off the whole deal. Merging QB and Collahuasi could make or break the entire merger. It is in Glencore's best interest to own as much of the merged mines as possible; it is not in Glencore's best interest to make demands so excessive that a mine merger it has wanted for years turns to dust in the Andean desert.

The World Athletics Championships Tokyo 25 kicked off in the capital on Saturday with race walker Hayato Katsuki taking home the bronze, earning Japan its first medal.

The championships are being held in Japan for the third time. Tokyo hosted the 1991 championships and Osaka hosted in 2007.

More than 2,000 athletes from about 200 countries and regions are expected to take part in 49 disciplines over nine days through Sept. 21.

For the men's and women's 35-kilometer race walks, which were the first events, competitors started and finished at Japan National Stadium in Shinjuku Ward. Spectators lined up along the ginkgo tree-lined avenue in the Meiji Jingu Gaien area, cheering along the athletes as they passed through.

In the men's event, Katsuki, 34, finished third with a time of 2 hours 29 minutes 16 seconds, marking the sixth consecutive world championships in which a Japanese athlete won a medal in race walk.

Canada's Evan Dunfee, 34, won gold with a time of 2:28:22. Masatora Kawano, 26, who led until late in the race, faded to finish in 18th place.

Yukiko Umeno, 22, who came in 15th, was the first Japanese athlete to finish in the women's race.

“I really wanted to win the race, but the world's top athletes were so much faster than I imagined,” Katsuki said after the race. “Still, I hope, at the very least, this medal gives Team Japan a boost.”

BELGRADE, September 13. /TASS/. The special services of several countries are financing protests in Serbia, spending $4 billion on this, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said.

"Four billion dollars have been spent on destroying the state. The main organizer of the color revolutions comes from outside. These are employees of various special services, and they are doing this from several countries," Vucic said in an interview with TV Informer.

He explained that he had to remain silent before because doing so would have violated Serbia's neutrality toward the possible instigators of the protests. However, he noted that "these countries know that we are aware of what they are doing."

Previously, Vucic reported that 9,380 people participated in protests across the country on September 5, with more than 7,000 gathering in Novi Sad. According to the Serbian president, the most serious incidents took place there: a group of people in balaclavas tried to occupy the philosophy faculty of the local university, but the police prevented this attempt.

Commenting on the events, Serbian Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabic said that European officials not only support unauthorized protests but also participate in them personally. She particularly noted the presence in Novi Sad of European Parliament lawmaker Rasmus Nordqvist from Denmark and Vula Tsetsi, co-chair of the European Green Party from Greece, calling their statements about the rule of law hypocritical while supporting anarchic actions in Serbia.

Reuters

12:00 JST, September 13, 2025

LONDON (Reuters) — Degraded land, polluted air and water stress pose a direct global economic threat, but using natural resources more efficiently could cut pollution by half, one of the World Bank's senior managing directors told Reuters.

The damage is particularly acute for low-income countries most at threat from poverty, climate change and biodiversity loss, Axel van Trotsenburg said.

Speaking alongside the publication of a new report on Sept. 1, he said around 80% of people in low-income nations were exposed to all three and the World Bank was committed to responding even as many countries cut aid budgets.

“Our commitment … is ending poverty on a liveable planet, full stop. We will not waver on this,” van Trotsenburg said.

Among the most impacted countries are Burundi, where 8 million people face water risk and air pollution, and 7 million face land degradation. In Malawi, 12 million people face all three risks, the report said.

More broadly, 90% of the world's population face at least one of the challenges, with the report urging countries to repurpose subsidies currently spent on harmful activities.

The report is published against a fractious political backdrop ahead of November's COP30 climate talks in Brazil. The World Bank and other multilateral lenders are also awaiting the outcome of a U.S. review of their operations ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump in February.

The World Bank would provide data-backed evidence to inform discussions on environmental degradation among its member governments, van Trotsenburg said.

The report estimated that forests help around half of the world's rain clouds form and said deforestation cut rainfall at a cost of $14 billion a year for the nine-country Amazon region alone, a material hit for the affected nations.

It also means landscapes are less able to store and release moisture slowly over time. That amplifies the effects of droughts and results in a $379 billion hit, or 8% of global agricultural economic output.

While ecological threats were often seen as being distant, the report zeroed in on economic impacts happening now.

“We've often had this mantra that we believed countries need to grow first, pollute and clean up later. What this evidence is telling you is that is simply false,” the bank's chief economist for sustainable development and report coauthor, Richard Damania, said.

Lithuania is prepared to immediately shut its border with Belarus in the event of a provocation, Lithuanian Interior Minister Vladislav Kondratovic said on Sept. 12. 

The minister's statement comes two days after Russia violated Polish airspace with 19 drones overnight on Sept. 10, forcing Poland to shoot down the UAVs. The incident marks NATO's first direct engagement with Russian drones since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine.

Following the drone breach, Lithuanian officials joined Poland in condemning Russia for the incursion and Kremlin ally Belarus for allowing Russia to use its airspace. 

Kondratovic told the outlet LRT radio that while Lithuania will keep its border with Belarus open for now, the State Border Guard has the authority to close them indefinitely if provoked in any way. 

"At any time, if there is any provocation, border guards have the option of closing the border," Kondratovic said. 

"After that, the government would decide on a longer closure period after assessing the whole situation. But if something happens — a drone, a provocation, or suspicious troop movements – we can do it."

Lithuania is keeping the border open at present out of concern for EU citizens still in Belarus, Kondratovic said. 

Poland temporarily closed all of its border crossings with Belarus on Sept. 12 due to the start of the Zapad-2025 military drills, joint exercises between Minsk and Moscow. The decision to close the border was made prior to Russia's drone incursion. 

Previously, Poland already closed most border crossings with Belarus, leaving only two in operation.

 "You need something that's going to flip a switch in the Kremlin's brain," the former U.K. Prime Minister told the Kyiv Independent. 

The new guidelines, which are still being ironed out, will include general recommendations such as harsher criteria for Russians coming to the EU. 

Russia launched a tirade of attacks killing three people in Kostiantynivka, Donetsk Oblast, and killing one in Borova, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian authorities reported on Sept. 13. 



“NATO's commitment to win has been far less than 100%, and the purchase of Russian oil, by some, has been shocking,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social. 

 In episode 3 of “Dare to Ukraine: Village,” host Masha Lavrova discovers that village life is about more than chores — it's about earning the trust of the community.

It is the third time Russian forces have used pipelines as a tactic, which they first adopted during the Battle of Avdiivka. Back in March, around 100 troops passed through a gas pipeline to reach Ukrainian positions in Sudzha, in Russia's Kursk Oblast. 

"Eastern Sentry is not just a new initiative – it is a clear signal: NATO's borders are inviolable, and the security of our citizens remains a priority," Poland's General Staff wrote on X.

Ukrainian air defense downed 137 drones in the north, south, east, and center of Ukraine, according to the Air Force. 

The top European diplomat described Russia's three-step negotiation tactic: demanding what it never had, followed by ultimatums and threats, finished off by the West ready to concede to Moscow's demands.

The number includes 950 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck near the Russian peninsula of Kamchatka overnight on Sept. 13, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reported.

"If something happens — a drone, a provocation, or suspicious troop movements — we can do it," Lithuanian Interior Minister Vladislav Kondratovic said.

The latest reported death toll includes 36,568 volunteers, 18,261 recruited prisoners, 14,797 mobilized troops, and 2,777 mercenaries.

"As of today, we can state that the Russian offensive operation on Sumy has been completely thwarted by our forces," President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 12, citing front-line reports from Commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi.

Florida's Department of Education announced on Sept. 11 that it will look into public school teachers who, on social media, celebrated or justified the assassination of Turning Point USA CEO and founder Charlie Kirk.

Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas sent a letter to school district superintendents telling them that he would be investigating after it was brought to his attention that some educators had posted “despicable comments on social media regarding the horrific assassination of Charlie Kirk.”

UNITED NATIONS, September 13. /TASS/. The Kiev regime has never strived for peace and all its actions aim to prolong the conflict, Russian Permanent Representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzya said.

"As soon as the real chance for peace emerged with the arrival of the White House leader ready to get to the crisis' root causes and seek a stable solution, Zelensky immediately began to renounce all previously voiced peace initiatives. This merely confirms what we have been saying all along: the Kiev regime has never had any aspiration for peace and everything it is doing only aims to continue the conflict, stay in power and continue to exploit its Western handlers," the diplomat said at a session of the UN Security Council.

The Russian envoy noted that as Vladimir Zelensky's popularity rating and the level of confidence in him are plummeting, "continued combat" becomes a "tool of political survival" for the Ukrainian authorities. Nebenzya reiterated that Zelensky rejected Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal to come to Moscow to discuss the Ukrainian settlement while he continues to visit European capitals demanding "arms supplies and increased military aid.".

Russia's offensive in Sumy Oblast has been "completely thwarted" by Ukrainian forces, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Sept. 12 following a briefing with Ukraine's top military command. 

Moscow launched its summer offensive in Ukraine's northeast and eastern regions in May, opening up a new front line in Sumy Oblast. Russian forces seized several villages in May and June, coming within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the regional capital of Sumy. 

"As of today, we can state that the Russian offensive operation on Sumy has been completely thwarted by our forces," Zelensky said in his nightly address, citing front-line reports from Commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi. 

"Fighting continues in the border areas of Sumy Oblast, but the Russian group in the Sumy area has lost offensive capabilities due to the losses suffered."

In late June, Syrskyi reported that Russia's advance in Sumy Oblast had faltered, with Ukraine stabilizing the line of contact and beginning to liberate territory. Ukrainian forces reported additional advances and liberated villages in July and August. 

Moscow launched the offensive in May, shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the military to create a "security buffer zone" along the northern border with Ukraine. Putin's order came as Russia once again rejected a U.S. and European proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine. 

Sumy Oblast has been a key target for Russian forces throughout the full-scale invasion due to its location on the northeastern frontier. It continues to face near-daily strikes, but Ukrainian forces have maintained control over most of the region.

Earlier this week, Syrsky reported that Ukrainian troops had prevented Russian forces from launching a planned major offensive in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. 

Russia continues to make gains in eastern Ukraine, concentrating the bulk of its forces in Donetsk Oblast in an attempt to seize the strategic logistic hub Pokrovsk. Syrskyi claimed on Sept. 7 that Ukrainian forces retook five times more territory than it lost in the Pokrovsk sector in August.

 "You need something that's going to flip a switch in the Kremlin's brain," the former U.K. Prime Minister told the Kyiv Independent. 

The new guidelines, which are still being ironed out, will include general recommendations such as harsher criteria for Russians coming to the EU. 

Russia launched a tirade of attacks killing three people in Kostiantynivka, Donetsk Oblast, and killing one in Borova, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian authorities reported on Sept. 13. 



“NATO's commitment to win has been far less than 100%, and the purchase of Russian oil, by some, has been shocking,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social. 

 In episode 3 of “Dare to Ukraine: Village,” host Masha Lavrova discovers that village life is about more than chores — it's about earning the trust of the community.

It is the third time Russian forces have used pipelines as a tactic, which they first adopted during the Battle of Avdiivka. Back in March, around 100 troops passed through a gas pipeline to reach Ukrainian positions in Sudzha, in Russia's Kursk Oblast. 

"Eastern Sentry is not just a new initiative – it is a clear signal: NATO's borders are inviolable, and the security of our citizens remains a priority," Poland's General Staff wrote on X.

Ukrainian air defense downed 137 drones in the north, south, east, and center of Ukraine, according to the Air Force. 

The top European diplomat described Russia's three-step negotiation tactic: demanding what it never had, followed by ultimatums and threats, finished off by the West ready to concede to Moscow's demands.

When Charlie Kirk was shot and killed by a sniper on Wednesday, he was sitting under a tent printed with the words “Prove me wrong” at Utah Valley University, debating a young liberal TikTok creator about mass shootings in the United States involving transgender people. The event, attended by some 3,000 people, was being livestreamed across social media. Mr. Kirk was in his natural habitat. 

The 31-year-old MAGA influencer, Trump ally and impassioned Christian had built his brand upon his unabashed views on hot-button issues including gender identity and LGBTQ rights, gun control, Black Lives Matter and immigration – relishing opportunities to debate his detractors. 

These public clashes with his critics, shared in clips on TikTok and X, propelled Mr. Kirk into the MAGA-sphere and eventually, into U.S. President Donald Trump's close orbit. With his charisma and controversial opinions, Mr. Kirk shaped the political views of a new generation of right-leaning young Americans, turning political discourse into a spectator sport. 

The widespread dissemination of these kinds of out-of-context clips and sound bites, featuring inflammatory verbal sparring, has become increasingly popular in online spaces, turning up the temperature in an already polarized political climate. 

Mr. Kirk's views, which he also espoused on his podcast The Charlie Kirk Show and on social media, were often called homophobic, racist and antisemitic. He said the U.S. Civil Rights Act was a “mistake” and that it spurred changes that are now used as an “anti-white weapon.” He also called for a ban on all gender-affirming care, and claimed that Jews control American colleges, non-profits and Hollywood. 

Opinion: Charlie Kirk is a sick nation's sacrifice

In a 2024 video titled Can 25 Liberal College Students Outsmart 1 Conservative, produced by the YouTube channel Jubilee, Mr. Kirk debates students one by one, attempting to prove statements such as “abortion is murder” and “college is a scam.” 

Since the video was posted a year ago, it has more than 32 million views. Shorter clips, spliced in a way to make viewers feel angry or excited depending on their politics, have also gone viral on X and TikTok. 

“I fear that people generally tune into this sort of thing for the reason they tune into other forms of gladiatorial combat: they want to watch their champion defeat, and ideally embarrass, ‘those idiots' on the other side,” says Eli Finkel, professor and co-director of Northwestern University's Litowitz Center for Enlightened Disagreement. 

“It feeds into a mode of conflict that's more about the satisfaction with ‘owning the libs,' or vice versa, than about serious engagement with political ideas or policies,” he says.

For young people, who mainly get their news from social media, ingesting modern politics in this manner is especially enticing. 

“If you look at people's media consumption patterns, particularly younger generations, they tend to consume media that doesn't involve so much reading as watching or listening in short clips that are easily digestible,” says Jeffrey Blevins, a politics and media professor at the University of Cincinnati. He notes that it's usually the sharpest soundbites, not the most nuanced, that go viral. 

Opinion: The assassination of Charlie Kirk has revealed the authoritarian inside all of us

In recent years, a crop of “debate me bros” have emerged in conservative online culture: political influencers who go viral for challenging their opponents to rhetoric showdowns, such as Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson or conservative commentator Ben Shapiro. 

The left has their own cohort, too, including British writer and former MSNBC commentator Mehdi Hasan (he recently appeared in a Jubliee video titled 1 Progressive vs 20 Far-Right Conservatives) and Twitch streamer Hasan Piker, who had debated Mr. Kirk in the past, and planned to do so again later this month at Dartmouth College. 

Catherine Tebaldi, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Luxembourg who has studied the rise of Mr. Kirk and the rebranding of Christian nationalism on American campuses, says his style of debate videos is a product of the hyper-masculine world of “the manosphere.”

“The debates are circulating particular well-worn tropes, arguments from the manosphere or Christian right, rebranded as killer arguments to ‘destroy the left',” says Dr. Tebaldi, adding that some conservative influencers paint colleges as “indoctrination factories.”

On Friday morning, officials identified 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as the suspect alleged to have shot Mr. Kirk. 

Who was Charlie Kirk? What to know about the Trump ally shot dead in Utah

Many internet sleuths concluded that because it appeared Mr. Robinson came from a conservative family, college must have “radicalized” him, a common talking point made by Mr. Kirk.

Officials have not announced a motive, but Utah Governor Spencer Cox said in a press conference Friday that Mr. Robinson had “become more political in recent years” and had discussed his dislike of Mr. Kirk with a family member. 

In the aftermath of the arrest, anonymous users called for vengeance and posted violent threats against Mr. Robinson, the Democratic Party and progressives as a whole. 

Dr. Blevins, the media and politics professor, says online debate culture – and the resulting viral clips – can make politics feel even more controversial. 

“It tends to make us more polarized, it tends to be more divisive because you're not trying to understand the other side. You're not trying to make any intellectual compromise,” he says. 

“It also tends to amplify the rhetoric. Already, we're seeing things like ‘We're at war' and ‘We're coming after you,'” Dr. Blevins says, referring to comments made by high-profile conservatives such as Steve Bannon and Alex Jones. “None of that is helpful.”

Bureau officials confirmed that Tyler Robinson, 22, was in a "romantic relationship" with the unnamed person, who is a male transitioning to a female, and that they shared an apartment in Saint George, Utah. Those FBI officials told Fox News Digital that Robinson's partner is fully cooperating with the FBI's investigation.

One FBI official told Fox News Digital the individual has been "extremely cooperative," and said the person "had no idea" Robinson was allegedly planning to assassinate the Turning Point USA founder. The person is not currently accused of any criminal activity in connection with the assassination.

FBI officials told Fox News Digital that the FBI had text messages and other communications between Robinson and his partner that helped FBI agents zero in on Robinson. Officials said the FBI took evidence from their apartment, including computers, which has been sent to Quantico for review, Fox News Digital has learned.

The FBI declined to comment on whether Robinson's partner would be charged with a crime.

"The FBI is investigating a record number of tips," an FBI spokesperson said. "Every connection, every group, every link will be investigated and anyone involved in this matter, anywhere in the world they might be, will be brought to justice."

The apartment Robinson and his partner shared is in the same southern Utah community Robinson's parents live in. It is approximately four hours away from Utah Valley University, where Robinson allegedly shot Kirk.

Kirk was killed Wednesday as he spoke to a crowd at the school's campus in Orem. Authorities believe a single shot was fired from the roof of a building some 200 yards away. Kirk was 31, and the married father of two young children.

Moments before Robinson allegedly shot Kirk, an audience member asked Kirk: "Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?" 

Kirk replied: "Too many." 

Kirk was then asked: "Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?" 

Kirk replied: "Counting or not counting gang violence?" 

Kirk was then assassinated. 

A law enforcement source told Fox News Digital that Robinson's father, who ultimately turned him in to authorities, told the FBI that he recognized his son from surveillance video images which FBI Director Kash Patel directed to be made public as the 33-hour manhunt unfolded.

The source told Fox News Digital that when Robinson arrived at his father's home, he said he wanted to kill himself. The source told Fox News Digital that the father spoke with a minister the family knew before turning in his son. 

Meanwhile, the rifle that the FBI believes was used to kill Kirk contained ammunition inscribed with anti-fascist messaging.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox confirmed the messaging at a news conference Friday, saying investigators discovered inscriptions on casings found with a bolt-action rifle near the campus.

One used casing and three unused casings contained the writings, Cox said.

News of the ammunition inscriptions was first shared on social media Thursday morning in a preliminary bulletin attributed to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Three American veterans all working to get food to Palestinians in Gaza tell Fox News Digital about what it's like volunteering on the ground.

American veterans working with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) want to set the record straight on what's happening on the ground nearly two years into the war.

Jason Murray, Scott Weimer and Brandon Zielinski — all U.S. military veterans — are working to ensure Palestinians in Gaza get the food they need. 

All three men spoke with Fox News Digital and said that they are proud of the work they're doing on the ground with GHF.

"We kind of built a plane in flight … not even knowing where we were going to land," Murray said of the situation. 

GHF began its operations in May 2025, more than a year and a half after the war began. While facing challenges distributing aid in Gaza, Murray said he has seen parallels to his military service, which has helped him as a GHF volunteer.

Weimer told Fox News Digital that when the opportunity presented itself, it seemed like a "natural fit" and that he felt he could fill a need in a way that others couldn't. He also said that his service experience, along with Murray's, worked in this type of environment where they were able to find people with the right skills and put them where they'd be most useful.

When he was in the military, Zielinski said he experienced a lot of bilateral training in which he did not always speak the same language as his counterparts. He said his experience working through language barriers has helped in his interactions with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which coordinates with GHF.

All three men spoke of the desperation they saw from hungry Palestinians trying to get food. They also described bad actors taking advantage of the situation – including Hamas operatives and gang members trying to harm people working with GHF, especially Palestinian locals.

Murray gave Fox News Digital some insight as to how the IDF and GHF coordinate when it comes to keeping bad actors out and letting civilians in need get to the aid.

"From a security standpoint, our goal is to provide aid in a safe and secure manner. Hamas does operate in this area. Again, we know that. We have been told through various means that, ‘Hey, Hamas was here today,'" Murray told Fox News Digital. 

He also said that the threat of Hamas is not one that GHF personnel take lightly.

HAMAS LOSING IRON GRIP ON GAZA AS US-BACKED GROUP GETS AID TO PALESTINIANS IN NEED

Weimer echoed Murray's sentiment, saying that the GHF personnel "absolutely see Hamas in the background," but their focus in the foreground is working to get aid to those in need. He also gave Zielinski's team credit for warding off the bad actors who try to interfere with GHF's mission.

"They are amazing because the amount of people that are seeking food and seeking aid can be overwhelming at times. I have never once seen any of us overreact to what would be, I think, to anybody, a very scary situation," Weimer said of Zielinski and his team.

Before Zielinski's team gets to work, they're usually given an IDF briefing on the security situation regarding the 48 hours or so prior to their shift. Zielinski told Fox News Digital that he has seen changes to the secure distribution sites (SDS) over time due to the threats that exist in the area.

"We've had pistols seen before, there's been AKs seen before. There's grenades that went off," Zielinski told Fox News Digital. 

He also said that his team looks for patterns, records them and then turns into intelligence officials information or materials that can be used to catch bad actors.

"We'll see down the line that, okay, ‘Hey, we've seen this person before, he looked very suspicious,' and next thing you know, this is a guy that has a pistol on him," Zielinski said.

US-BACKED GAZA AID GROUP LAUNCHES BOLD NEW SYSTEM TO DELIVER FOOD DIRECTLY TO FAMILIES

When asked what the American people should know about the reality on the ground in Gaza, the volunteers all said that it's important to do some research.

Weimer told Fox News Digital that the media depictions of GHF upset him because they're "so far askew." He said he has called home to tell his family that they should not "believe the hype."

"I guess that's what I would tell the American people is, you know, these people that are here, these military veterans that lived a long honorable life, we would never be a part of something [like] what I've seen in the media," Weimer said. "It really actually sickens me, it's just so far askew."

Zielinski emphasized the passion that GHF volunteers have for the work that they do. He said that the people he works with in the war-torn enclave strive to do whatever possible to help civilians in need.

Since it began operating in May, GHF says it has delivered more than 160 million meals to Palestinians in need. The organization has not operated in the smoothest environment. Despite facing terror threats and international criticism, GHF maintains its call to the international community to join its mission – to deliver food to those who need it.

"Everybody wants to help, and everybody sees the reward for doing so… We all just enjoy doing it," Zielinski said.

Erika Kirk, the widow of Charlie Kirk, made her first public remarks since her husband's death.

Erika Kirk, the widow of Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk, has lived much of her adult life in the public eye – first as Miss Arizona USA, later as a ministry leader and entrepreneur, and most recently as a wife and mother who shared her husband's outspoken Christian faith. Their love story, rooted in prayer and purpose, shaped not only their marriage but the movement he built, a legacy she now carries forward after his death.

Hours before her life changed forever, Erika Kirk, posted a Bible verse, Psalm 46:1, which says: "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble." 

A baptized Catholic who attended Notre Dame Preparatory High School in Scottsdale, Arizona, Erika Kirk currently hosts a podcast called "Midweek Rise Up." It's described on her website as a devotional series released every Wednesday, along with Monday Meditations, "to provide you that deep breath of, ‘God's got this.'" 

The website says each episode "is intentionally and prayerfully crafted with words of encouragement to push you, Biblical leadership to challenge you, and God-breathed Scripture to posture your heart for the best that's yet to come."

Erika and Charlie met in 2018 and then had a "very long dinner." Charlie said that he knew "almost immediately" that she was the one.

Erika posted a selfie of her and Charlie on Sept. 5, 2023, marking five years since the two met. She wrote, "5 years ago today, we sat inside Bill's Burgers in NYC deep in conversation and banter over theology, philosophy, and politics and at the end, you paused, looked at me and said, ‘I'm going to date you.'" 

Both Erika and Charlie spoke openly about the importance of dating with intention, something they said they did when they met.

Charlie proposed to Erika in December 2020. She captioned photos of the engagement on Instagram, "When God writes your love story, you get to marry your best friend." The two married less than a year later in May 2021.

In a post with their wedding photos, Erika wrote, "To the man I've been praying for, before I ever met you. [T]o the man that I honor, respect, and deeply cherish. [T]o the man that leads in ways that remind me of the leaders before our time and [whose] confidence in God's word reminds me of Daniel... [T]o the man that I am immeasurably blessed to be able to call my husband. My CJK. I love you, [Charlie]."

The role God played in their love story was a theme throughout Erika's posts about her husband. 

In February, Erika posted a video to Instagram featuring herself, Charlie and their children that was captioned: "thank you for being my love story." 

The post has since gone viral after the TPUSA CEO's death. Charlie commented on the video: "my favorite."

In her first Instagram post after her husband's assassination, Erika wrote, "The world is evil. But our Savior. Our Lord. Our God. Не... Не is so good. I will never have the words. Ever."

On Thursday, Charlie Kirk's casket was flown aboard Air Force Two along with Erika, Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance. The vice president was one of the people who carried Kirk's casket onto the plane.

As they exited the aircraft, Erika and Usha were seen holding hands in a viral image that showed the Kirks' closeness to the administration. Erika Kirk also waived to supporters from the motorcade with a cross in hand. 

Both the vice president and President Donald Trump were open about their relationships with Charlie Kirk and mourned him publicly, with the president ordering flags at half-staff across the nation.

Another image of Erika that went viral was her leaning over Charlie's open casket, seemingly hugging her late husband. The photo was included with the first post she made after his death and included a video of her holding and kissing her late husband's lifeless hands.

Erika was no stranger to the limelight when she met Charlie. In 2012, she was crowned Miss Arizona USA. Her Instagram has photos of her bonding with other contestants and visiting the Pentagon while wearing her Miss Arizona sash. Her website still features options for those looking to book her as a model or actress.

In addition to her pageant title, Erika was an NCAA basketball player at Regis University in Denver, Colorado, and graduated from Arizona State University after double majoring in Political Science and International Relations. She also earned a Juris Master's in American Legal Studies at Liberty University.

In 2016, she started BIBLEin365, challenging others to commit to reading the Bible over the course of a year. The challenge later became a ministry program, which "seeks to help individuals engage with the scriptures daily," according to her website.

Two years later, she launched Proclaim Streetwear, a faith-based clothing company that joined forces with BIBLEin356 in September 2021. Each month Proclaim hosts a free virtual BIBLEin365 live Q&A with Erika and Pastor James Kaddis.

AUBURN COACH BRUCE PEARL SAYS CHARLIE KIRK WAS ASSASSINATED BECAUSE 'THEY COULDN'T BEAT HIM' IN TRIBUTE

Despite her accomplishments in the worlds of faith, fashion and pageants, Erika emphasized that her priorities in life included being a wife and mother.

"Above all, Erika cherishes her role as the wife of Charlie Kirk and the mother of their precious son and daughter," her biography on her website reads. "As she continues to grow in her ministry, leadership, and entrepreneurial endeavors, Erika remains committed to inspiring others to live with purpose, rooted in faith and driven by the love of Christ in every aspect of life."

On Friday, Erika broke her silence and gave a moving statement on camera while standing next to the empty chair in which Charlie recorded his podcast.

"Two days ago, my husband, Charlie, went to see the face of his savior and his God," she said through tears. "And one of the final conversations that he had on this earth, my husband witnessed for his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Now and for all eternity he will stand at his Savior's side wearing the glorious crown of a martyr."

She added that Charlie's favorite Bible verse was Ephesians 5:25, which says: "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her."

In her message to America, Erika made it clear that the movement her husband started would not die with him. She announced that Turning Point USA would continue its campus tour and would hold its America Fest, which is scheduled to take place in Phoenix, Ariz., in December.

Charlie Kirk, who was killed during an event at Utah Valley university on Wednesday, is survived by his wife and their two young children, whose names have not been made public.

Anna Scott Marsh, friend of Charlie Kirk, joins Fox News Live to speak on his legacy and impact he had on the American youth.

Tens of thousands of people took part in a "Unite the Kingdom" rally in London, England, on Saturday, where demonstrators also honored Charlie Kirk with some holding pictures and banners of the late conservative activist. 

Organizers played a heartwarming tribute video to Kirk that included a viral clip of him giving life advice to a 13-year-old girl at a Turning Point USA event.

The rally was organized by activist Tommy Robinson, who said the video was shown to thank and "honor the life of one of our generation's greatest." Elon Musk also appeared via video link and condemned the left as "the party of murder" following Kirk's death.

YOUTH LEADERS MOURN 'THE GODFATHER OF CAMPUS CONSERVATISM' CHARLIE KIRK FOLLOWING ASSASSINATION

Robinson billed the march as a demonstration for free speech, saying it was also held in defense of British heritage and culture.

"A man who inspired a generation of young men based on courage and based on faith," Robinson told the cheering crowd, which also sang Kirk's name.

"In honor of Charlie Kirk and in honor of freedom on the 13th we march," Robinson wrote in a social media post earlier in the week.

One demonstrator carried a sign reading, "Freedom of speech is dead. RIP Charlie Kirk," according to The Associated Press.

Aerial shots showed streams of demonstrators carrying the St. George's red-and-white flag of England and the Union Jack. Many chanted, "We want our country back."

Police estimated the crowd at about 110,000 people, while organizers claimed the figure was in the "millions." A rival protest drew about 5,000 marchers.

FOX NEWS PERSONALITIES OFFER EMOTIONAL TRIBUTES TO CHARLIE KIRK: 'HE LOVED AMERICA SO MUCH'

"You see how much violence there is on the left, with our friend Charlie Kirk getting murdered in cold blood this week, and people on the left celebrating it openly," Musk said. "The left is the party of murder."

Robinson praised Musk for purchasing Twitter and lifting bans on right-wing commentators, saying Saturday's event would not have been possible without him.

He added that the British public was "telling the world they're ready to fight back," linking that directly to Musk giving them a platform.

Robinson told the crowd in a hoarse voice that migrants now had more rights in court than the "British public, the people that built this nation."

The marches come as the U.K. is riven by debate over migrants crossing the English Channel in overcrowded boats to arrive without authorization.

Musk warned of the dangers of stifling free speech and said the U.K. was at a critical point in its history.

"You can't get to the truth without freedom of speech, without active debate… the essence of democracy is a government for the people, by the people."

He added that the U.K. was in danger of losing its identity due to mass migration, accusing the BBC of being "complicit in the destruction of Britain." He also claimed mass migration was being used to import new voters.

"I see a rapidly increasing erosion of Britain with massive, uncontrolled migration and a government that has failed in its duty to protect its citizens."

"Britain is at a fork in the road — to darkness or greatness — and that will be decided only in a matter of years."

Mötley Crüe frontman Vince Neil is opening up about the major health scare that put the band on hold.

Last Christmas, Neil suffered a stroke so severe his doctors didn't believe he'd be able to walk again, he told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in a new interview.

"I had a stroke," he explained. "My whole left side went out."

The rocker said that when he went to bed on the night of Dec. 25, he felt fine. He woke up the next morning and went to get out of bed, but found that he wasn't able to do so.

"I had to learn to walk again, and that was tough," he told the outlet. "The doctors said they didn't think I'd be able to go back on stage again. I go, ‘No, no, I'm gonna do it. Watch and see.'"

Neil said the first step of his recovery involved the band, saying, "Mötley canceled the first part of the (residency) so I could get better."

In March, Mötley Crüe pushed back dates of their Las Vegas residency to this fall, explaining that the change in schedule was "due to a required medical procedure recently advised by vocalist Vince Neil's doctors."

During that time, Neil focused on physical therapy, which he did from his Nashville home.

"I went from people carrying me to the bathroom, because I couldn't walk myself, finally to a wheelchair," he said. "I graduated to a walker, and then I had a cane. Now I don't need anything. But it's like a full-time job getting back to where you feel good again."

He added, "It takes a while to get your brain to start moving your legs, for them to do what your brain wants to do. You try to walk but it doesn't come out right."

Neil said his recovery, which later involved working out with a football coach and "a lot of running," has been "tough," but he's doing well now.

"I'm back, I'm 90, 95% to where I was before, and it's going to be great," he said.

Neil first returned to the stage in August, performing at MGM Music Hall at Fenway in Boston with Bret Michaels. On Friday, he and the rest of Mötley Crüe played the first rescheduled show of their Las Vegas residency.

Ahead of the concert, Neil told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the show's set list is "extensive, with some deep cuts, but the songs that fans want to hear."

The band played hits like "Dr. Feelgood," "Kickstart My Heart" and "Girls, Girls, Girls" during the show.

"It takes you through the full Mötley Crüe lifestyle," Neil said. "I am going to push through the best I can."

The late Charlie Kirk's alleged shooter Tyler Robinson lived with a transgender-identifying partner, a source familiar confirmed to the Washington Examiner.

Robinson's roommate is a biological male who identifies as a female, and is cooperating with the FBI on their investigation. The bureau had texts between the shooter and the person that helped them confirm that Robinson is the shooter.

LONDON (AP) — A massive London march organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson became unruly Saturday as a small group of his supporters clashed with police who were separating them from counterprotesters.

Several officers were punched, kicked and struck by bottles tossed by people at the fringes of the “Unite the Kingdom” rally, Metropolitan Police said. Reinforcements with helmets and riot shields were deployed to support the 1,000-plus officers on duty.

“We continue to see significant aggression directed at officers by ‘Unite the Kingdom' protesters,” police posted on the X platform.

At least nine people were arrested, but police indicated many other offenders had been identified and would be held accountable.

Police estimated that Robinson drew about 110,000 people, while the rival “March Against Fascism” protest organized by Stand Up To Racism had about 5,000 marchers. 

The marches had been largely peaceful, but toward the late afternoon, “Unite the Kingdom” supporters threw items at the rival rally and tried to break through barriers set up to separate the groups. Officers had to use force to keep a crowd-control fence from being breached, the police said. 

Counterprotesters heckled a man with blood pouring down his face who was being escorted by police from the group of Robinson supporters. It wasn't immediately clear what happened to him.

The larger crowd stretched from Big Ben across the River Thames and around the corner beyond Waterloo train station, a distance of about three-quarters of a mile (around a kilometer). 

While the crowd was large, it fell far short of the one of the biggest recent marches when a pro-Palestinian rally drew an estimated 300,000 people in November 2023.

Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon and is known for his nationalist and anti-migrant views, billed the march as a demonstration for free speech, and also said it was in defense of British heritage and culture.

Robinson told the crowd in a hoarse voice that migrants now had more rights in court than the “British public, the people that built this nation.”

The marches come at a time when the U.K. has been riven by debate over migrants crossing the English Channel in overcrowded inflatable boats to arrive on shore without authorization. 

Numerous anti-migrant protests were held this summer outside hotels housing asylum-seekers following the arrest of an Ethiopian man who was later convicted of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in a London suburb. Some of those protests became violent and led to arrests.

Participants in the “Unite the Kingdom” march carried the St. George's red-and-white flag of England and the union jack, the state flag of the United Kingdom, and chanted “we want our country back.” U.K. flags have proliferated this summer across the U.K. — at events and on village lampposts — in what some have said is a show of national pride and others said reflects a tilt toward nationalism.

Some Robinson supporters held signs saying “stop the boats,” “send them home,” and “enough is enough, save our children.” 

At the counterprotest, the crowd held signs saying “refugees welcome” and ”smash the far right,” and shouted “stand up, fight back.”

Robinson supporters chanted crude refrains about U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and also shouted messages of support for slain U.S. conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

One demonstrator held a sign saying: “Freedom of speech is dead. RIP Charlie Kirk.” 

Robinson had planned a “Unite the Kingdom” rally last October, but couldn't attend after being jailed for contempt of court for violating a 2021 High Court order barring him from repeating libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee who successfully sued him. He previously served jail time for assault and mortgage fraud.

Robinson founded the nationalist and anti-Islamist English Defence League and is one of the most influential far-right figures in Britain. He urged followers not to wear masks, drink booze or get violent.

It's been happening for decades, and in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, Washington, D.C., has finally shown that it has no appetite for unity, only fight.

President Donald Trump, himself an assassination target — twice — said “radicals” on both sides need to calm down. But on Fox News, he added, “The radicals on the left are the problem.”

Liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) responded, “Oh, please,” as she blamed Trump for poisoning the political environment.

POLITICAL VIOLENCE ON THE RISE IN THE US: A TIMELINE OF KEY INCIDENTS

Trump had a chance to deliver a unifying message, as predecessors Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton would have, but it's not his thing. And even if he had, as he did after his own near-death experience in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, it likely wouldn't have lasted.

Our editor, Hugo Gurdon, finding symbolism in the name of Kirk's group, Turning Point USA, said the assassination of the youthful conservative organizer provided a special turning point for the nation.

“His death may have forced politicians who purport to be leaders to a turning point. It is fragile and may break down. But perhaps it will be a turning point toward traditional values and civilized restraint,” Gurdon wrote.

For our weekly White House Report Card, Democratic pollster John Zogby called out all of Washington's leaders. “The president and Congress have behaved shamefully.”

EDITORIAL: WHAT THE MURDER OF CHARLIE KIRK MEANS

John Zogby

Grade: D

This week was defined by a human tragedy: the murder of a father, husband, son, and activist, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk.

Our hearts go out to his family, but this should not have become a springboard for hysteria, partisanship, and meltdown. That dishonors a young man's life. The president and Congress have behaved shamefully.

In other regards, it was another miserable week for President Donald Trump. Job growth was revised downward by 911,000 from April to March. Unemployment claims increased sharply. Inflation ticked up again, partly due to the new tariffs imposed.

Jamie Dimon of J.P. Morgan Chase warned that the economy is definitely in a slowdown.

A Reuters poll found a sense of unease by Americans toward the president sending troops to U.S. cities, including a deep concern that he is expanding his power.

Israel hit  Doha, Qatar, an ally that has been hosting peace talks, neutralizing the president's effort to persuade Hamas to accept terms for a ceasefire.

Trump insulted Tom Hanks, and Congress released his birthday message to Jeffrey Epstein — which he denied writing.

And his polling approval is still upside down and has not moved an inch. Too much going on.

DEMOCRATS MUM ON GUN CONTROL BUT CONDEMN POLITICAL VIOLENCE AFTER CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSINATION

Jed Babbin

Grade: B-

Almost everything else in the news was overtaken by the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA. Kirk was a leader of young folks, a conservative thinker, and a confidant of President Donald Trump. Overshadowed in the news was the Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace, a slight increase in inflation, and Israel's bombing of a building in Qatar where Hamas leaders have been living in luxury for at least a decade.

Trump announced the capture of Kirk's alleged killer on Fox News on Friday. Tyler Robinson had been the subject of an intense FBI manhunt. His surrender was a relief, but not to the millions who mourned Kirk.

The August grisly murder of Ukrainian emigre Iryna Zarutska seemed to capture the media for a day. With Kirk's murder, we seem to be — thanks to the woke Democrats and Democratic judges not doing their jobs — drifting into anarchy.

The Russian incursion into Polish airspace consisted of over a dozen drones. Poland invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty, which requires consultation when any treaty member's sovereignty is threatened. Anyone who believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is interested in peace should have their head examined.

The Israeli attack on Qatar is thoroughly justified by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1343, which makes it improper for any member of the United Nations to aid, harbor, or otherwise support terrorists. Qatar has been doing all of these things for Hamas leaders for over a decade. Nevertheless, Trump and Arab nations condemned the raid.

The small increase in inflation is almost certainly due to Trump's tariffs. The Supreme Court will decide his authority on tariffs soon.

Retired NYPD inspector Paul Mauro and former FBI Assistant Director Chris Swecker discuss the capture of Charlie Kirk assassination suspect Tyler Robinson.

EXCLUSIVE: President Trump on Saturday praised FBI Director Kash Patel for the remarkable speed in which the bureau identified and captured Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin.

Tyler Robinson, 22, was nabbed in his hometown of Washington, Utah, just 33 hours after he allegedly shot Kirk from a rooftop on the campus of Utah Valley University. The capture came after a frantic manhunt that began with only grainy images of the suspect's figure fleeing the scene.

WHO IS TYLER ROBINSON? WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT CHARLIE KIRK'S SUSPECTED ASSASSIN

"I am very proud of the FBI," Trump said, speaking exclusively with Fox News Digital. "Kash—and everyone else—they have done a great job." 

Officials shared with Fox News Digital new details of the timeline of the investigation into the identification and arrest of Tyler Robinson and the unusual hands-on role Patel played in the process.

According to the FBI, Robinson was seen on the campus on Sept. 10, the day Kirk was shot, presumably conducting reconnaissance between 8:28 and 9:34 a.m. At 11:52 a.m., Robinson returned, climbed an exterior stairway to the roof of the Losee building, and took up a position at the highest level of the roof at 12:22 p.m., according to officials. He allegedly  shot Kirk just a minute later.

Robinson then lowered himself from the roof and dropped to the ground, authorities said. Two minutes after he allegedly shot Kirk, Robinson ran into a nearby wooded area, where the gun was later found.

Local FBI was on the scene immediately after the shooting, and Patel arrived at around 5:30 p.m. local time on Sept. 11.

TIMELINE OF CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSINATION 

Patel was walked through the entire crime scene, and stood where Kirk was murdered. Patel walked each step the suspect took, according to sources familiar with the investigation.

Patel also went to the rooftop where Robinson had allegedly perched and retraced his steps as he fled, including into the wooded area where the gun, a Mauser 30.06 rifle, was found.

Patel personally directed agents as they processed evidence and prepared to send it to Quantico, ATF labs, or local labs. Sources told Fox News Digital that Patel then directed the evidence to be loaded onto a plane with initial forensics and evidence collected and sent it back to the FBI labs for processing.

A law enforcement source told Fox News Digital that, typically, when evidence is collected in an investigation, an agent ships it to the labs. But the source said Patel directed that the evidence and fingerprints be sent back to Quantico via plane—traveling back and forth from Utah collecting and delivering evidence.

"The DNA was being analyzed through the night because the director was there and he was directing all of this," the source told Fox News Digital. "He directed everyone and said ‘You're going to get the evidence out now.'"

The source added: "The evidence was getting back to the labs in rapid-speed. That's why he was caught so quickly."

Fox News Digital also learned that Patel, against all recommendations, demanded the video footage of the suspect be released to the public.

A law enforcement source familiar told Fox News Digital that Robinson's father, who ultimately turned him in to authorities, told the FBI that he recognized his son in that released video.

            When graphic videos go viral, like the recent fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk, it can feel impossible to protect yourself from seeing things you did not consent to see. But there are steps you can take.
    


            Social media platforms are designed to maximize engagement, not protect your peace of mind. The major platforms have also reduced their content moderation efforts over the past year or so. That means upsetting content can reach you even when you never chose to watch it.
    


            You do not have to watch every piece of content that crosses your screen, however. Protecting your own mental state is not avoidance or denial. As a researcher who studies ways to counteract the negative effects of social media on mental health and well-being, I believe it's a way of safeguarding the bandwidth you need to stay engaged, compassionate and effective.
    


            Research shows that repeated exposure to violent or disturbing media can increase stress, heighten anxiety and contribute to feelings of helplessness. These effects are not just short-term. Over time, they erode the emotional resources you rely on to care for yourself and others.
    


            Protecting your attention is a form of care. Liberating your attention from harmful content is not withdrawal. It is reclaiming your most powerful creative force: your consciousness.
    


            Just as with food, not everything on the table is meant to be eaten. You wouldn't eat something spoiled or toxic simply because it was served to you. In the same way, not every piece of media laid out in your feed deserves your attention. Choosing what to consume is a matter of health.
    


Read more: Is there any hope for the internet?



            And while you can choose what you keep in your own kitchen cabinets, you often have less control over what shows up in your feeds. That is why it helps to take intentional steps to filter, block and set boundaries.
    


            Fortunately, there are straightforward ways to reduce your chances of being confronted with violent or disturbing videos. Here are four that I recommend:
    


            Social media is not neutral. Its algorithms are engineered to hold your attention, even when that means amplifying harmful or sensational material. Watching passively only serves the interests of the social media companies. Choosing to protect your attention is a way to reclaim your agency.
    


            The urge to follow along in real time can be strong, especially during crises. But choosing not to watch every disturbing image is not neglect; it is self-preservation. Looking away protects your ability to act with purpose. When your attention is hijacked, your energy goes into shock and outrage. When your attention is steady, you can choose where to invest it.

            You are not powerless. Every boundary you set – whether it is turning off autoplay, filtering content or curating your feed – is a way of taking control over what enters your mind. These actions are the foundation for being able to connect with others, help people and work for meaningful change.
    


            I'm the executive director of the Post-Internet Project, a nonprofit dedicated to helping people navigate the psychological and social challenges of life online. With my team, I designed the evidence-backed PRISM intervention to help people manage their social media use.

            Our research-based program emphasizes agency, intention and values alignment as the keys to developing healthier patterns of media consumption. You can try the PRISM process for yourself with an online class I am launching through Coursera in October 2025. You can find the course, Values Aligned Media Consumption, by searching for Annie Margaret at the University of Colorado Boulder on Coursera.

Fox News' Lara Trump joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the fallout from the Charlotte train stabbing as left-wing leaders face criticism for soft crime policies. 

FIRST ON FOX: People who are not proficient in English could be shut out of taking the U.S. citizenship test under a new House Republican proposal.

Rep. Randy Fine, R-Fla., plans to introduce a bill that would mandate the citizenship test be taken entirely in English, Fox News Digital has learned.

There are several different components to the U.S. citizenship exam. While most portions are English-only, the civics test — in which the applicant is asked 10 out of 100 possible questions on U.S. history and government — can currently be taken in other languages, provided that certain criteria are met.

Fine's bill would eliminate those exceptions.

"The fact that U.S. citizenship applicants can currently use an interpreter to take the naturalization test undermines the idea of assimilation into American culture. If you want to live in an English-speaking country, you should be able to speak English, period," Fine told Fox News Digital.

"My bill will require all applicants to take the naturalization test exclusively in English, because both metaphorically and literally, everyone who enters our country with the intent of staying should speak our language."

Current law states that people aged 50 or older who have lived in the U.S. as a permanent resident for at least 20 years are allowed to take the civics portion in another language.

People aged 55 or older who have been a U.S. permanent resident for at least 15 years have the same exemption.

Both groups of people are required to bring an interpreter fluent in English and their native language to the exam.

The bill would likely run into opposition from immigrant advocacy groups, however.

Fine's proposal comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March naming English as the country's official language — the first time in its history that the U.S. has done so.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The union that represents tens of thousands of actors and other entertainment and media professionals has elected Sean Astin as its new president.

On Friday, SAG-AFTRA elected Astin — an actor who appeared in “The Lord of the Rings,” “Stranger Things” and “Rudy” — to succeed Fran Drescher as its president. Astin is the son of the late Academy Award-winning actress Patty Duke and John Astin, who starred in the 1960s TV series “The Addams Family.”

Sean Astin defeated Chuck Slavin in a 79% to 21% vote. Michelle Hurd was elected secretary-treasurer. 

Patty Duke, Sean Astin's mother, served as the Screen Actors Guild's president from 1985-1988.

According to its website, SAG-AFTRA brings together Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. It represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, broadcast journalists, dancers, DJs, program hosts, recording artists and others.

Under Drescher, the union has navigated a pair of strikes involving film and television actors and a separate one involving video game and interactive media performers.

 It depends on who you ask.

When it comes to AI, as California goes, so goes the nation. The biggest state in the US by population is also the central hub of AI innovation for the entire globe, home to 32 of the world's top 50 AI companies. That size and influence have given the Golden State the weight to become a regulatory trailblazer, setting the tone for the rest of the country on environmental, labor, and consumer protection regulations — and more recently, AI as well.

Now, following the dramatic defeat of a proposed federal moratorium on states regulating AI in July, California policymakers see a limited window of opportunity to set the stage for the rest of the country's AI laws. In the early hours of Saturday morning, the California State Assembly voted 29 to 8 in favor of SB 53, a bill that would require transparency reports from the developers of highly powerful, “frontier” AI models. The bill, which has passed both parts of the state legislature, now goes to Gov. Gavin Newsom to either be vetoed or signed into law.

The models targeted represent the cutting-edge of AI — extremely adept generative systems that require massive amounts of data and computing power, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, xAI's Grok, and Anthropic's Claude.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

AI can offer tremendous benefits, but as the bill is meant to address, it's not without risks. And while there is no shortage of existing risks from issues like job displacement and bias, SB 53 focuses on possible “catastrophic risks” from AI. Such risks include AI-enabled biological weapons attacks and rogue systems carrying out cyberattacks or other criminal activity that could conceivably bring down critical infrastructure. Such catastrophic risks represent widespread disasters that could plausibly threaten human civilization at local, national, and global levels. They represent risks of the kind of AI-driven disasters that have not yet occurred, rather than already-realized, more personal harms like AI deepfakes.

Exactly what constitutes a catastrophic risk is up for debate, but SB 53 defines it as a “foreseeable and material risk” of an event that causes more than 50 casualties or over $1 billion in damages that a frontier model plays a meaningful role in contributing to. How fault is determined in practice would be up to the courts to interpret. It's hard to define catastrophic risk in law when the definition is far from settled, but doing so can help us protect against both near- and long-term consequences.

By itself, a single state bill focused on increased transparency will probably not be enough to prevent devastating cyberattacks and AI-enabled chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons. But the bill represents an effort to regulate this fast-moving technology before it outpaces our efforts at oversight.

SB 53 is the third state-level bill to try to specifically focus on regulating AI's catastrophic risks, after California's SB 1047, which passed the legislature only to be vetoed by the governor — and New York's Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, which recently passed the New York legislature and is now awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul's approval.

SB 53, which was introduced by state Sen. Scott Wiener in February, requires frontier AI companies to develop safety frameworks that specifically detail how they approach catastrophic risk reduction. Before deploying their models, companies would have to publish safety and security reports. The bill also gives them 15 days to report “critical safety incidents” to the California Office of Emergency Services, and establishes whistleblower protections for employees who come forward about unsafe model deployment that contributes to catastrophic risk. SB 53 aims to hold companies publicly accountable for their AI safety commitments, with a financial penalty up to $1 million per violation.

“The science of how to make AI safe is rapidly evolving, and it's currently difficult for policymakers to write prescriptive technical rules for how companies should manage safety.”

In many ways, SB 53 is the spiritual successor to SB 1047, also introduced by Wiener.

Both cover large models that are trained at 10^26 FLOPS, a measurement of very significant computing power used in a variety of AI legislation as a threshold for significant risk, and both bills strengthen whistleblower protections. Where SB 53 departs from SB 1047 is its focus on transparency and prevention

While SB 1047 aimed to hold companies liable for catastrophic harms caused by their AI systems, SB 53 formalizes sharing safety frameworks, which many frontier AI companies, including Anthropic, already do voluntarily. It focuses squarely on the heavy-hitters, with its rules applying only to companies that generate $500 million or more in gross revenue.

“The science of how to make AI safe is rapidly evolving, and it's currently difficult for policymakers to write prescriptive technical rules for how companies should manage safety,” said Thomas Woodside, the co-founder of Secure AI Project, an advocacy group that aims to reduce extreme risks from AI and is a sponsor of the bill, over email. “This light touch policy prevents backsliding on commitments and encourages a race to the top rather than a race to the bottom.”

Part of the logic of SB 53 is the ability to adapt the framework as AI progresses. The bill authorizes the California Attorney General to change the definition of a large developer after January 1, 2027, in response to AI advances.

Proponents of the bill were optimistic about its chances of being signed by the governor should it pass the legislature. On the same day that Gov. Newsom vetoed SB 1047, he commissioned a working group focusing solely on frontier models. The resulting report by the group provided the foundation for SB 53. “I would guess, with roughly 75 percent confidence, that SB 53 will be signed into law by the end of September,” said Dean Ball — former White House AI policy adviser, vocal SB 1047 critic, and SB 53 supporter — to Transformer.

But several industry organizations rallied in opposition, arguing that additional compliance regulation would be expensive, given that AI companies should already be incentivized to avoid catastrophic harms. OpenAI has lobbied against it, and technology trade group Chamber of Progress argues that the bill would require companies to file unnecessary paperwork and unnecessarily stifle innovation.

“Those compliance costs are merely the beginning,” Neil Chilson, head of AI policy at the Abundance Institute, told me over email. “The bill, if passed, would feed California regulators truckloads of company information that they will use to design a compliance industrial complex.”

By contrast, Anthropic enthusiastically endorsed the bill on Monday. “The question isn't whether we need AI governance – it's whether we develop it thoughtfully today or reactively tomorrow,” the company explained in a blog post. “SB 53 offers a solid path toward the former.” (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI, while Future Perfect is funded in part by the BEMC Foundation, whose major funder was also an early investor in Anthropic. Neither organization has editorial input into our content.)

The debate over SB 53 ties into broader disagreements about whether states or the federal government should drive AI safety regulation. But since the vast majority of these companies are based in California, and nearly all do business there, the state's legislation matters for the entire country.

“A federally led transparency approach is far, far, far preferable to the multi-state alternative,” where a patchwork of state regulations can conflict with each other, said Cato Institute technology policy fellow Matthew Mittelsteadt in an email. But “I love that the bill has a provision that would allow companies to defer to a future alternative federal standard.”

“The natural question is whether a federal approach can even happen,” Mittelsteadt continued. “In my opinion, the jury is out on that but the possibility is far more likely that some suggest. It's been less than 3 years since ChatGPT was released. That is hardly a lifetime in public policy.”

But in a time of federal gridlock, frontier AI advancements won't wait for Washington.

The bill's focus on, and framing of, catastrophic risks is not without controversy.

The idea of catastrophic risk comes from the fields of philosophy and quantitative risk assessment. Catastrophic risks are downstream of existential risks, which threaten humanity's actual survival or else permanently reduce our potential as a species. The hope is that if these doomsday scenarios are identified and prepared for, they can be prevented or at least mitigated.

But if existential risks are clear — the end of the world, or at least as we know it — what falls under the catastrophic risk umbrella, and the best way to prioritize those risks, depends on who you ask. There are longtermists, people focused primarily on humanity's far future, who place a premium on things like multiplanetary expansion for human survival. They're often chiefly concerned by risks from rogue AI or extremely lethal pandemics. Neartermists are more preoccupied with existing risks, like climate change, mosquito vector-borne disease, or algorithmic bias. These camps can blend into one another — neartermists would also like to avoid getting hit by asteroids that could wipe out a city, and longtermists don't dismiss risks like climate change — and the best way to think of them is like two ends of a spectrum rather than a strict binary.

You can think of the AI ethics and AI safety frameworks as the near- and longtermism of AI risk, respectively. AI ethics is about the moral implications of the ways the technology is deployed, including things like algorithmic bias and human rights, in the present. AI safety focuses on catastrophic risks and potential existential threats. But, as Vox's Julia Longoria reported in the Good Robot series for Unexplainable, there are inter-personal conflicts leading these two factions to work against each other, much of which has to do with emphasis. (AI ethics people argue that catastrophic risk concerns over-hype AI capabilities and ignores its impact on vulnerable people right now, while AI safety people worry that if we focus too much on the present, we won't have ways to mitigate larger-scale problems down the line.)

But behind the question of near versus long-term risks lies another one: what, exactly, constitutes a catastrophic risk?

SB 53 initially set the standard for catastrophic risk at 100 rather than 50 casualties — similar to New York's RAISE Act — before halving the threshold in an amendment to the bill. While the average person might consider, say, many people driven to suicide after interacting with AI chatbots to be catastrophic, such a risk is outside of the bill's scope. (The California State Assembly just passed a separate bill to regulate AI companion chatbots by preventing them from participating in discussions about suicidal ideation or sexually explicit material.)

SB 53 focuses squarely on harms from “expert-level” frontier AI model assistance in developing or deploying chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons; committing crimes like cyberattacks or fraud; and “loss of control” scenarios where AIs go rogue, behaving deceptively to avoid being shut down and replicating themselves without human oversight. For example, an AI model could be used to guide the creation of a new deadly virus that infects millions and kneecaps the global economy.

“The 50 to 100 deaths or a billion dollars in property damage is just a proxy to capture really widespread and substantial impact,” said Scott Singer, lead author of the California Report for Frontier AI Policy, which helped inform the basis of the bill. “We do look at like AI-enabled or AI potentially [caused] or correlated suicide. I think that's like a very serious set of issues that demands policymaker attention, but I don't think it's the core of what this bill is trying to address.”

Transparency is helpful in preventing such catastrophes because it can help raise the alarm before things get out of hand, allowing AI developers to correct course. And in the event that such efforts fail to prevent a mass casualty incident, enhanced safety transparency can help law enforcement and the courts figure out what went wrong. The challenge there is that it can be difficult to determine how much a model is accountable for a specific outcome, Irene Solaiman, the chief policy officer at Hugging Face, a collaboration platform for AI developers, told me over email.

“These risks are coming and we should be ready for them and have transparency into what the companies are doing,” said Adam Billen, the vice president of public policy at Encode, an organization that advocates for responsible AI leadership and safety. (Encode is another sponsor of SB 53.) “But we don't know exactly what we're going to need to do once the risks themselves appear. But right now, when those things aren't happening at a large scale, it makes sense to be sort of focused on transparency.”

However, a transparency-focused bill like SB 53 is insufficient for addressing already-existing harms. When we already know something is a problem, the focus should be on mitigating it.

“Maybe four years ago, if we had passed some sort of transparency legislation like SB 53 but focused on those harms, we might have had some warning signs and been able to intervene before the widespread harms to kids started happening,” Billen said. “We're trying to kind of correct that mistake on these problems and get some sort of forward-facing information about what's happening before things get crazy, basically.”

SB 53 risks being both overly narrow and unclearly scoped. We have not yet faced these catastrophic harms from frontier AI models, and the most devastating risks might take us entirely by surprise. We don't know what we don't know.

It's also certainly possible that models trained below 10^26 FLOPS, which aren't covered by SB 53, have the potential to cause catastrophic harm under the bill's definition. The EU AI Act sets the threshold for “systemic risk” at the smaller 10^25 FLOPS, and there's disagreement about the utility of computational power as a regulatory standard at all, especially as models become more efficient.

As it stands right now, SB 53 occupies a different niche from bills focused on regulating AI use in mental healthcare or data privacy, reflecting its authors' desire not to step on the toes of other legislation or bite off more than it can reasonably chew. But Chilson, the Abundance Institute's head of AI policy, is part of a camp that sees SB 53's focus on catastrophic harm as a “distraction” from the real near-term benefits and concerns, like AI's potential to accelerate the pace of scientific research or create nonconsensual deepfake imagery, respectively.

That said, deepfakes could certainly cause catastrophic harm. For instance, imagine a hyper-realistic deepfake impersonating a bank employee to commit fraud at a multibillion-dollar scale, said Nathan Calvin, the vice president of state affairs and general counsel at Encode. “I do think some of the lines between these things in practice can be a bit blurry, and I think in some ways…that is not necessarily a bad thing,” he told me.

It could be that the ideological debate around what qualifies as catastrophic risks, and whether that's worthy of our legislative attention, is just noise. The bill is intended to regulate AI before the proverbial horse is out of the barn. The average person isn't going to worry about the likelihood of AI sparking nuclear warfare or biological weapons attacks, but they do think about how algorithmic bias might affect their lives in the present. But in trying to prevent the worst-case scenarios, perhaps we can also avoid the “smaller,” nearer harms. If they're effective, forward-facing safety provisions designed to prevent mass casualty events will also make AI safer for individuals.

If Gov. Newsom signs SB 53 into law, it could inspire other state attempts at AI regulation through a similar framework, and eventually encourage federal AI safety legislation to move forward.

How we think about risk matters because it determines where we focus our efforts on prevention. I'm a firm believer in the value of defining your terms, in law and debate. If we're not on the same page about what we mean when we talk about risk, we can't have a real conversation.

BASKING RIDGE, N.J. (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday he believes the Russia-Ukraine war would end if all NATO countries stopped buying oil from Russia and placed tariffs on China of 50% to 100% for its purchases of Russian petroleum.

Trump posted on his social media site that NATO'S commitment to winning the war “has been far less than 100%" and the purchase of Russian oil by some members of the alliance is “shocking.” As if speaking with NATO members, he said: “It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia.”

Since 2023, NATO member Turkey has been the third largest buyer of Russian oil, after China and India. according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Other members of the 32-state alliance involved in purchasing Russian oil include Hungary and Slovakia. It's unclear whether Trump would want to directly confront Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan or Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. That leaves uncertain whether the threats might actually lead to new tariffs or a ban on Russian oil purchases.

Trump's post arrives after the Wednesday flight of multiple Russian drones into Poland, an escalatory move by Russia as it was entering the airspace of a NATO ally. Poland shot down the drones, yet Trump played down the severity of the incursion and Russia's motives by saying it “could have been a mistake.”

While Trump as a candidate promised to end the war quickly, he has yet to hit the pressure points needed to end the violence and has at times been seen as reluctant to confront Russian President Vladimir Putin. Congress is currently trying to get the U.S. president to back a bill toughening sanctions, after Trump last month hosted Putin in Alaska for talks that failed to deliver on progress toward peace.

The U.S. and its allies are seeking to show a firmer degree of resolve against Russia. At an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting Friday, acting U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea said America “will defend every inch of NATO territory” and that the drones entering Poland “intentionally or otherwise show immense disrespect for good-faith U.S. efforts to bring an end to this conflict.”




Britain on Friday also took steps to penalize the trading of Russian oil, including a ban on 70 vessels allegedly used in its transportation. The United Kingdom also sanctioned 30 individuals and companies, included businesses based in China and Turkey, that have supplied Russia with electronics, chemicals, explosives and other weapons components.

Trump in his post Saturday said a NATO ban on Russian oil plus tariffs on China would “also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR.”

The president said that NATO members should put the 50% to 100% tariffs on China and withdraw them if the war that launched with Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine ends.

“China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia,” he posted, and powerful tariffs “will break that grip.”

The U.S. president has already imposed a 25% import tax on goods from India, specifically for its buying of Russian energy products. He has placed in total a 50% tariff on India, though Trump has indicated that negotiations with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi could help settle differences.

The prospect of further import tax hikes on China and its retaliation could carry collateral damage for the U.S. and European economies.

Earlier this year, Trump hit Chinese goods with new tariffs totaling 145%, prompting China to respond with 125% import taxes on American goods. Taxes at that level were essentially a blockade on commerce between the world's two largest economies, causing worries about global growth that led to negotiations that ratcheted down the tariffs being levied by both nations.

So that trade talks could proceed, America lowered its tariffs against China to a still-high 30%, while China took its rate to 10%.

In his post, the Republican president said responsibility for the war fell on his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He did not include in that list Putin, who launched the invasion.

Trump's post builds on a call Friday with finance ministers in the Group of Seven, a forum of industrialized democracies. During the call, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called on their counterparts to have a “unified front” to cut off “the revenues funding Putin's war machine,” according to Greer's office.

"Dukes of Hazzard" star John Schneider told Fox News Digital that disagreements should be solved through debate, not violence. 

Jason Aldean is paying tribute to Charlie Kirk in a special way.

The country singer performed a show in Detroit, Michigan, on Sept. 11, the day after Kirk was assassinated during a speaking engagement in Orem, Utah. At one point during the concert, he took a moment to speak about Kirk and the impact he had on his life and career.

"An amazing person by the name of Charlie Kirk was murdered yesterday in Utah," he told fans, as seen in video captured by an audience member.

Cheers erupted at the mention of Kirk's name, and Aldean continued to explain that he knew Kirk personally and had the opportunity to meet with him multiple times over the past few years.

"One of the best people ever," he said of the late Turning Point USA founder. "This is not the guy you go after, is what I'm trying to say."

He continued, "And it's a weird country that we live in when you start taking people out because you disagree with their opinions. That's not what we're about here."

Aldean went on to talk about his 2023 single, "Try That in a Small Town." At the time of its release, the song and its accompanying music video earned a bit of backlash, enough that the video was pulled out of the Country Music Television (CMT) network's rotation.

"I remember when we put this song out, people like Charlie Kirk were some of the first people to come up and go, ‘That's what it's about. This country coming together, calling out the bulls--- when we see it, trying to get everything back on track,'" Aldean said Thursday.

"This guy wanted nothing more than what was best for all of us, and for our kids moving forward," he continued.

"Charlie is a guy that's going to be very, very much missed, and this is something that his legacy is going to live on forever with Turning Point [USA] and what he's done with only 31 years on this planet, it's amazing."

He went on to play "Try That in a Small Town" in honor of Kirk.

Following Kirk's death Wednesday, Aldean also paid tribute to him with an Instagram post. He shared a photo of himself and wife Brittany Aldean with Kirk, and in his caption he wrote, "It's been a hard day not only in our family, but all over the country."

He continued, "Charlie Kirk was one of the kindest, smartest and bravest people I've ever met. I'm honored to have met and spoke with him on a few occasions. He was a man of peace and wanted nothing but the best for our country and its youth. We might have lost Charlie today but what he has done will live on forever. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, kids and the entire Kirk family."

In 2023, Aldean told Fox News Digital that his controversial song resonated with many people, apparently including Kirk, because they were "tired" of living in a country that, in his opinion, has turned into the "Wild West."

"I just think there's a lot of people out there that just want to go to work and come home, raise their kids, feel comfortable about sending their kids to school and knowing that they're going to come home," Aldean said. "Or let their kids go to a movie on a weekend and not worry about something crazy happening to them in the parking lot or inside a movie theater."

He continued, "It's just we're kind of living in the Wild West right now, and I think people are just kind of tired of it. There's just constant chaos and something going on. Somebody is always pissed off about something, and it's just one of those songs where there's a lot of people that could relate to that because they're just sick of it."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Hours after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, FBI Director Kash Patel declared online that “the subject” in the killing was in custody. The shooter was not. The two men who had been detained were quickly released, and Utah officials acknowledged that the gunman remained at large.

The false assurance was more than a slip. It spotlighted the high-stakes uncertainty surrounding Patel's leadership of the bureau when its credibility — and his own — are under extraordinary pressure. 

Patel now approaches congressional oversight hearings this coming week facing not just questions about that investigation but broader doubts about whether he can stabilize a federal law enforcement agency fragmented by political fights and internal upheaval.

Democrats are poised to press Patel on a purge of senior executives that has prompted a lawsuit, his pursuit of President Donald Trump's grievances long after the Russia investigation ended, and a realignment of resources that has prioritized the fight against illegal immigration and street crime even though the agency has for decades been defined by its work on complicated threats like counterintelligence and public corruption.

That's in addition to questions about the handling of files from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case, the addition of a co-deputy director to serve alongside Dan Bongino, and the use of polygraphs on some agents in recent months to identify sources of leaks. Republicans, meanwhile, are likely to rally to his defense or redirect the spotlight toward the bureau's critics.

The hearings will offer Patel his most consequential stage yet, and perhaps the clearest test of whether he can convince the country that the FBI, under his watch, can avoid compounding its mistakes in a time of political violence and deepening distrust.




“Because of the skepticism that some members of the Senate have had and still have, it's extremely important that he perform very well at these oversight hearings” on Tuesday and Wednesday, said Gregory Brower, a former FBI executive who served as its top congressional affairs official.

The FBI declined to comment about Patel's coming testimony to the committee. 

Kirk's killing was always going to be a closely scrutinized investigation, not only because it was the latest burst of political violence inside the United States but also because of Kirk's friendships with Trump, Patel and other administration figures and allies.

While agents from Salt Lake City investigated, Patel's account on the social media platform X posted that “the subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody.” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said at a near-contemporaneous news conference that “Whoever did this, we will find you,” suggesting authorities were still searching. Patel soon after posted that the person in custody had been released.

“That does not deliver the message that you want the public to hear,” said Chris O'Leary, a retired FBI counterterrorism executive. “It had the opposite effect. People start to wonder what is going in. This looks like the Keystone Cops and it continues to get worse.”

The next day, a scheduled afternoon news conference was canceled for “rapid developments” as Patel and Bongino flew to Utah. It was held instead in the evening. Patel appeared but did not speak.

As the search stretched on for over a day, Patel angrily vented to FBI personnel Thursday about what he perceived as a failure to keep him informed, including that he was not quickly shown a photograph of the suspected shooter. That's according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to discuss it by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press. The New York Times earlier reported details of the call.

On Friday morning, authorities announced the arrest at a news conference where Patel claimed credit for certain investigative steps, saying, “At my direction, the FBI released the first set of FBI photos.”

Asked about the scrutiny of his performance, the FBI issued a statement saying that it had worked with local law enforcement to bring the suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, to justice and “will continue to be transparent with the American people.”

Patel's overall response did not go unnoticed in conservative circles. One prominent strategist, Christopher Rufo, posted on X that it was “time for Republicans to assess whether Kash Patel is the right man to run the FBI.”

On the same day Kirk was killed, Patel faced a separate problem: a lawsuit from three FBI senior executives fired in an August purge that wiped away decades of institutional experience and that they characterized as a Trump administration retribution campaign.

Among them was Brian Driscoll, who as acting FBI director in the early days of the Trump administration resisted Justice Department demands for names of agents who investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Driscoll alleged in the lawsuit that he was let go following a clash with Patel over administration demands to fire an FBI pilot who'd been wrongly identified on social media as the case agent in the classified documents investigation of Trump. 

The lawsuit quotes Patel as having told Driscoll his job depended on firing people the White House wanted gone. The FBI has declined to comment on the lawsuit.

The other plaintiffs are Spencer Evans, a former top agent in Las Vegas whose termination letter cited a “lack of reasonableness and overzealousness” in implementing COVID-19 policies while serving as a human resources official — a claim his lawyers call false — and Steve Jensen, who helped oversee FBI investigations into the Jan. 6. Capitol riot.

The upheaval continues a trend that began even before Patel took over, when more than a half-dozen of the bureau's most senior executives were forced out under a Justice Department rationale that they could not be “trusted” to implement Trump's agenda.

There's since been significant turnover in leadership at the FBI's 55 field offices. Some left because of promotions and planned retirements, but others because of ultimatums to accept new assignments or resign. The head of the Salt Lake City office, an experienced counterterrorism investigator, was pushed out of her position weeks before Kirk was killed at a Utah college, said people familiar with the move. 

In July, an agent based in Norfolk, Virginia, Michael Feinberg, authored a first-person account saying he was told to brace for a demotion and a polygraph exam because of his friendship with Peter Strzok , a lead FBI agent in the investigation into ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign fired over derogatory text messages sent about Trump. Feinberg resigned instead.

Patel arrived at the FBI having been a sharp critic of its leadership, including for investigations into Trump that he says politicized the institution. Under Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, the FBI and Justice Department have become entangled in their own politically fraught inquiries, such as one into New York Attorney General Letitia James.

He's moved quickly to remake the bureau, with the FBI and Justice Department working to investigate one of the Republican president's chief grievances — the years-old Trump-Russia investigation. Trump has routinely called that probe, which did not establish a criminal conspiracy between Russia and Trump's campaign, a “hoax” and “witch hunt.”

The Justice Department appeared to confirm in an unusual statement that it was investigating former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan, pivotal players in the Russia saga listed by Patel in a book he authored as “members of the Executive Branch Deep State,” but did not say for what. Bondi has directed that evidence be presented to a grand jury, and agents and prosecutors have begun requesting information and interviews from former officials related to the investigation, according to multiple people familiar with the outreach.

Critics of the fresh Russia inquiry consider it a transparent attempt to turn the page from the fierce backlash the FBI and Justice Department endured from elements of Trump's base following their July announcement that they would not be releasing any additional documents from the Epstein investigation.

Patel has meanwhile elevated the fight against street crime, drug trafficking and illegal immigration to the top of the FBI's agenda, in alignment with Trump's agenda.

The FBI has been key to the federal government's takeover of the Washington police department, participating with partner agencies in arrests for crimes, like drunken driving, not historically thought of as central FBI priorities.

The bureau makes no apologies for aggressive policing in American cities the Trump administration contends have been consumed by crime. Patel and Bongino have been promoting the number of arrests involving federal law enforcement in an initiative they dub Operation Summer Heat. Patel says the thousands of cumulative arrests, many of them immigration-related, are “what happens when you let good cops be good cops.”

But some are concerned the street crime focus could draw attention from the sophisticated public corruption and national security threats for which the bureau has long been primarily, if not solely, responsible for investigating. In one example, a federal corruption squad in Washington was disbanded this past spring.

“One of the big problems that I see is that the investigative programs that have been hurt the most this year are the ones that really only the FBI does, or the FBI does better than anybody else,” said Matt DeSarno, who retired in 2022 as head of the Dallas field office.

Nearly five months after Frisco, Texas, track star Austin Metcalf was stabbed to death at a high school competition, members of the public are continuing to pressure local authorities to release video of the attack. 

In a post on X on Wednesday, Elon Musk implored authorities to "release the video," as the topic began trending online following this week's stabbing death of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a commuter train in Charlotte, North Carolina. The attack on Zarutska was captured on surveillance video, which was released after the stabbing.

The Frisco Independent School District previously confirmed to Fox News Digital that it possesses surveillance video of the stabbing at Kuykendall Stadium but will not be publicly releasing it.

The outrage comes as Karmelo Anthony, 18, is charged with first-degree murder in the killing of Metcalf while at an April 2 track meet. 

The altercation allegedly unfolded during a rain delay at the district track and field championship, when Metcalf, a student at Memorial High School, told Anthony, of Frisco Centennial High School, he needed to move out of the Memorial team's tent, police said. 

The incident quickly escalated as Anthony "grabbed his bag, opened it and reached inside it" while telling Metcalf, "Touch me and see what happens," according to the police report.

"[Metcalf] stood up and pushed the male to get him out of the tent," the arrest report said.

A witness told police that Anthony then "reached into his bag and the male took a knife out of the bag and stabbed Austin," according to the report. The witness then told the officer that Anthony left the scene after the stabbing. Metcalf died in his twin brother's arms. He and Anthony were both 17 at the time.

Police arrested Anthony afterward, with his supporters insisting he acted in self-defense after Metcalf pushed him out of the tent.

Anthony's bond was initially set at $1 million, but was subsequently reduced to $250,000. He was released to home confinement and his trial was set for June 1, 2026. 

The Frisco Independent School District and Anthony's attorney did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Fox News Digital spoke to NYC Councilwoman Inna Vernikov about how Zohran Mamdani's anti-Israel rhetoric has stoked fear in the Jewish community.

A poll released this week showing socialist New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani with a commanding lead in the race also showed him leading the pack when it comes to messaging on the issue of Israel and Palestinians.

The New York Times/Siena College survey — which was conducted from Sept. 2 to 6 — found that the survey — which was conducted from Sept. 2 to 6 — asked likely New York City voters, regardless of which candidate they support, "which of the following mayoral candidates do you think has best addressed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during the campaign."

Mamdani led the field with 43%, followed by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo at 16%, Mayor Eric Adams at 11%, and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa at 8%.

The poll also showed that 46% of likely voters sympathized with Palestinians compared to 29% with Israel.

FLASHBACK: ZOHRAN MAMDANI SAYS ‘ISRAEL IS NOT A PLACE' AND ‘NOT A COUNTRY'

Mamdani's positions and past comments on Israel have been a hot button issue in the race as he has faced criticism from many in the Jewish community for refusing to explicitly denounce the phrase "globalize the intifada," supporting economic boycotts of Israel, surrounding himself with advisers that hold anti-Israel views, and a social media post last year that critics say was mocking Jewish people. 

Human rights attorney Brooke Goldstein told Fox News Digital the term "Israeli-Palestinian conflict" is a "misnomer in itself" and called the poll results "deeply troubling."

"In reality, his record is clear: he is an anti-Israel radical, a pro-Hamas sympathizer in a suit, running for office to undermine the very fabric of what this country stands for," Goldstein said.

"The fact that this has even become a campaign issue reflects just how poisoned our political system has become. Foreign agendas and blood-soaked ideologies have seeped into our politics, shaping them in hateful ways."

Goldstein continued, "Our education system, from K-12 through college, is radicalizing students at an alarming rate. If we do not take this seriously, and if figures like Mr. Mamdani are elevated to office, the consequences for America's future will be dire."

A spokesperson for StopAntisemitism also told Fox News Digital the poll results are "deeply troubling" and "underscores the growing hostility toward Israel we are seeing in New York", adding that a Mamdani victory would be "disastrous" for the city.

"The fact that so many New Yorkers view Mamdani as the best voice on Israel and Palestine is a sign of how deeply antisemitism has taken root in the city," the spokesperson told Fox News Digital. 

"His rise is not about thoughtful policy but about the normalization of antisemitism through extremist groups, such as the red-green alliance. New Yorkers deserve leadership that unites, not one that scapegoats Israel and emboldens violence toward Jews in America."

In addition to his positions on Israel, Mamdani has been heavily criticized on the issue of crime due to his past calls to defund the police and hostile comments about the New York Police Department. 

While the majority of likely NYC voters said crime and safety are their top concern, 30%, when asked regardless of who they support, which candidate would do the "best" job on crime, said Mamdani.

Cuomo followed with 29%, Sliwa with 23%, and Adams with 15%. The poll showed that a head-to-head race between Cuomo and Mamdani would significantly narrow Mamdani's lead to just four points. 

Rafael Mangual, senior fellow and head of research for policing and public safety at the Manhattan Institute, told Fox News Digital Mamdani's numbers in that category are due to having three opponents in the race.

"I read that as 70% don't trust him on crime," Mangual said. "The problem is that those skeptical of Mamdani's approach to public safety are split between three candidates."

Overall, the survey found that on the question of who people would support if the contest "were held today," a whopping 46% of likely New York City voters chose Mamdani, compared to just 24% who selected Cuomo.

Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa scored only 15%, while incumbent Mayor Eric Adams earned just 9%.

"New York City is not for sale. The backroom scheming from Donald Trump and the billionaire class is backfiring, as New Yorkers see Zohran Mamdani is the only candidate who will fight to make the most expensive city in the country more affordable," Mamdani campaign spokesperson Dora Pekec said in a statement. 

"Our campaign is busy building a movement that puts working people first – mobilizing thousands to get involved in the democratic process and fight for a new kind of politics," Pekec added.

A federal appeals court ruled on Friday to allow the Trump administration to go forward with stripping protections away from around 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.

A stay had been issued by a district court.

“We recognize the risks of irreparable harm persuasively laid out in the district court's order: that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month — a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries,” the judges wrote.

“But absent a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of such irreparable harms cannot, by itself, support a stay,” they added.With the ruling, the appeals court will lift the stay issued by the district court and allow the Trump administration to target thousands of migrants for deportation.

Esther Sung, the legal director of Justice Action Center and a co-counsel in the case, says the decision will “hurt everyone.”

“People who came here from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela did everything the government asked of them, and the Trump administration cruelly and nonsensically failed to hold up the government's end of the bargain,” Sung said. “While we are deeply disappointed by this decision, we will continue to advocate zealously for our clients and class members as the litigation continues.”

The Justice Department had argued that it has the power to revoke the temporary protections and that the Department of Homeland Security should be able to do so without court interference.

“The Secretary's discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter,” lawyers for the government wrote in their brief.

But plaintiffs argued that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem needed to end protections individually and not across the board.

“The district court applied the law correctly and did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Secretary Noem's action inflicted irreparable injury on the class members (among others) and that the public interest and balance of the equities tip sharply in favor of preliminary relief,” attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in a brief.

President Donald Trump's administration aims to deport a record number of people. The administration has sought court rulings, more detention centers, and more immigration officers and resources for them to contribute to that goal.

A flood of false and misleading claims filled social media in the two days it took officials to arrest and publicly identify 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as the suspect in Wednesday's assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University.

The reaction followed a well-worn pattern of misinformation and conspiracy theories that often come after breaking news events when facts can be fluid. Those kinds of posts appeared within hours of the shooting, with some of the earliest incorrectly identifying the gunman before officials had released any information about a suspect. More claims spawned on Thursday and Friday, presenting old videos and photos as recent footage of the shooter and erroneously reporting on Robinson's background.

Here's a look at the facts.

CLAIM: Robinson is a registered Republican.

THE FACTS: This is false. Utah records say Robinson was registered as a voter, but not affiliated with either political party. His voter status is inactive, meaning he did not vote in two regular general elections after receiving a notice from his county clerk. According to Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, Robinson's family said he had become “more political in recent years” and had criticized Kirk, mentioning that he was due to appear at an event in Utah and saying “Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate.” Cox stated that ammunition found at the scene was engraved with taunting, anti-fascist and meme culture messaging.

___

CLAIM: Robinson is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.

THE FACTS: This is false. Priscilla Yeverino, spokesperson for the group, confirmed that “we have no members in DSA named Tyler Robinson anywhere in the country.” A photo of a person who bears a resemblance to Robinson wearing a Salt Lake City DSA shirt with the slogan “bee the change” has been used to support this claim. Yeverino declined to confirm that person's identity “for this person's privacy and safety.” Prior to Robinson's arrest, many on social media were quick to assume the shooter was a Democrat and prominent conservative figures, including President Donald Trump, blamed liberal politics for Kirk's death.




__

CLAIM: A video of a man running toward a parking lot shows the shooter escaping.

THE FACTS: This is false. The video was filmed on July 28, more than a month before Kirk was shot and began spreading before Robinson was arrested. It shows Dakota Hawver, the suspected gunman who killed three people and injured three others at the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno, Nevada, running from the front of the resort in the direction of its front parking lot. Multiple local news networks published the footage after the Reno shooting. Hawver was shot by police and died in the hospital days later. A version of the misrepresented video included a caption falsely stating: “video shows Charlie Kirk's real shooter escaping.”

___

CLAIM: Democrats opposed a moment of prayer for Kirk in the House.

THE FACTS: This is misleading. On Wednesday, the House observed a “moment of prayer for Charlie Kirk and his family” at the request of Speaker Mike Johnson. A subsequent request for a “moment of prayer out loud” elicited vocal objections and chaos on the House floor. Footage shows members standing silently for about 30 seconds. Johnson then bangs his gavel and Rep. Lauren Boebert says that “silent prayers get silent results” before requesting that someone lead a spoken prayer as well. An audible “no” can be heard in response, among other protests. Shouting continues for about a minute, requiring Johnson to bang his gavel and state, “the House will be in order” several times. In the commotion, Johnson also says: “We will join for prayer right after this, OK?” Many posts claiming that Democrats had opposed a moment of prayer for Kirk shared clips that omitted Johnson's initial request and the ensuing silence.

___

CLAIM: The shooter was identified as Michael Mallinson or George Zinn. 

THE FACTS: This is false. Robinson was named as the suspected shooter on Friday. Others, including Mallinson and Zinn, were misidentified as the shooter as authorities searched for a suspect. Mallinson is a 77-year-old Toronto resident who told the CBC that he found out he had been wrongly accused after waking up from a nap and receiving a panicked call from his daughter telling him to delete his social media accounts. He said that before the shooting he had “never heard of Charlie Kirk.” Mallinson bears a resemblance to a man named George Zinn, who was filmed being dragged away handcuffed by two officers. The video spread widely on social media after the shooting. The Utah Public Safety Department said in a statement that it “initially took in George Zinn as a suspect,” but that he was later released and charged with obstruction. The statement said Zinn, as well as a second person who was taken into custody and released after interrogation, has “no current ties to the shooting.”

How MAHA gets American history wrong.

If you've been paying any attention to the fractious debate over American health policy, you've probably heard this phrase: “the sickest generation in American history.” The words can be found in the third sentence of a major report released in May by a presidential commission led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but the line itself essentially sums up the ethos of his Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement. America, and especially its children, is “the sickest country in the world,” as Kennedy himself told senators in a hearing earlier this month.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

This idea — that we are sicker than we've ever been — underpins the radicalism of the MAHA agenda. If it's true, then what choice do we have but to blow up the American health care system and remake it from top to bottom? Which is exactly what Kennedy aims to do.

Well, I'm here with some good news: It is not true. America is not, in fact, the sickest country in the world, and this generation — our kids included — is far from the sickest generation in American history. Once you gather the evidence, and once you realize the actual state of American health for much of the country's history, it's so not true that to ponder the question as it's stated feels almost absurd. Decades of progress in everything from vaccines and drugs to cleaner air and water have made Americans far healthier and longer-lived than their ancestors.

Does this mean that Americans are as healthy as they could be, or that we aren't seeing significant new health problems arise alongside that progress, like the growth of obesity, the spread of chronic diseases, and the rise of diagnosed mental illness? No. But one of the goals of this newsletter is to help put the very real problems of the present into perspective by understanding how far we've come from a much darker past. Our negativity bias, turbocharged by the maelstrom of social media, tempts us to catastrophize our present moment. In turn, we lunge for revolutionary solutions that risk destroying the foundation of the progress we've made.

Nowhere is that more the case than in our attitude toward American health, and nowhere are the risks of the blow-it-all-up approach more dangerous. So here's a reality check.

Death isn't the only enemy of medicine, but it is the last one. On that final score, today's Americans are better off on average than virtually any who came before them.

In the late 19th century, even as US cities were first being wired for electricity, life expectancy in the US was just 40 years — a sobering thought for someone like myself who is currently 47. Over the course of the 20th century alone, the average lifespan of Americans increased by more than 30 years. And nearly all of those gains came from improvements in public health, like the introduction of vaccines and antibiotics, improvements in cardiovascular care, safer roads and workplaces, and a cleaner environment and food supply. (MAHA decries the state of American food, but if you want to know what the unregulated system looked like at the turn of the 20th century, just read Upton Sinclair's stomach-turning classic The Jungle.)

The science writer Steven Johnson has a brilliant description for this phenomenon: it's as if Americans across the board gained “an extra life.” And while the long-term increase in US life expectancy reversed slightly during the Covid pandemic, it has since recovered. Today the average American can expect to live 78.4 years, or nearly twice as long as their great-great-great-grandparent born in the 1880s.

One of the biggest factors behind all that extra life is medicine's success against infectious disease. In 1900, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and diarrheal disease caused roughly one-third of all American deaths — and 30 percent of those deaths were in children under 5. In fact, as of 1915, an unimaginable one in 10 babies in the US died before their first birthday, just in case you still think today's children are the sickest ever. That is worse than Afghanistan suffers now. As late as the 1950s, some 16,000 Americans a year — most of them children — were stricken with paralytic polio.

Today, just a fraction of Americans die from infectious disease. Diseases like polio are a thing of the past thanks to vaccines, and the more recent contagion of HIV — which killed nearly half a million Americans between the early 1980s and the late 1990s — has now become a manageable condition thanks to amazing advances in antiviral treatments. One of the reasons the Covid pandemic was so overwhelming was that Americans had lost any experience with a widespread new infectious disease, and even there, estimates are that mRNA vaccines developed at lightning speed prevented millions of deaths.

As deaths from infectious disease dropped over the last century, Americans have increasingly begun to die from noninfectious diseases like heart attacks and cancer. In a way, this was a sign of health success — these diseases strike later in life, and living longer meant more Americans were reaching the age where cancer and cardiovascular disease become a threat. But despite some concerning data like the rise of some cancers in younger people, overall deaths from cancer have been consistently falling for decades, while heart attacks are far less fatal now than they were 50 years ago. One big reason for both trends: Smoking is way, way down. Fire up an episode of Mad Men and tell me those guys are healthier than we are today.

The haze wasn't just tobacco smoke. Take a look at Los Angeles circa 1979:

America in the 1960s and '70s was a highly polluted place, where environmental hazards directly harmed human health. Cars still ran on leaded gasoline, burning 200,000 tons of highly neurotoxic lead each year, with the result that an estimated half of US children at the time were exposed to adverse levels. Smog blanketed our cities, and water supplies received far less treatment. Polluted rivers literally caught on fire!

Today, water and air in America are far cleaner. Cumulative emissions of six major air pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide fell 78 percent between 1970, the baseline year for the monumental Clean Air Act, and 2023. Ambient levels of lead fell 99 percent between 1980 and 2005, and have kept falling since. That last bit is especially important — lead is highly toxic to children, leading to lower IQs and other developmental problems. The fact that children today have blood levels that are on average 96 percent lower than children in the late 1970s is an astounding improvement in public health. (Though not so great for me, given that I was a child in the late 1970s.)

One other way in which the safety of our environment has improved: Both vehicles and workplaces are less dangerous than they used to be. The per-mile fatality rate, though still too high, is about quarter what it was in 1970, while the car crash death rate for children under 13 has fallen 81 percent since 1975. Total workplace deaths have fallen by about 60 percent since 1970, even as the size of the American workforce has increased.

What about the health conditions in children, like autism and ADHD, that have really spiked in recent decades? As my Vox colleague Dylan Scott wrote this year, much of that apparent increase represents liberalizing diagnostic criteria, which have broadened to encompass many more children. The rate of US children with high-support needs autism, for instance, has only marginally grown over the past 30 years. In short, we're diagnosing more kids who previously would have been missed. That's a good thing if it gets them needed support earlier, but it does not back up the thesis that this generation of children is uniquely sick.

In fact, some doctors now believe that medicine has a broader problem of overdiagnosis in everything from mental health to certain kinds of cancer, both because of social changes in how health is viewed and improved testing methods picking up milder forms of disease that would have gone undetected in the past. “The bottom line is if you screen healthy people for an illness, any illness, be it cancer or high blood pressure, diabetes, then you will be picking up borderline cases and overtreating them,” Dr. Suzanne O'Sullivan, the author of The Age of Diagnosis: How Our Obsession With Medical Labels Is Making Us Sicker, told Vox in May.

From obesity and diabetes to youth mental health and drug overdose deaths, there is no shortage of ways in which we really are sick — and getting sicker. But I challenge anyone to go back to a time when one in every 10 American children died before the age of one, or when HIV was a clear death sentence, or when urban air was choked with smog, and tell me that we live in a uniquely sick time.

The way to address the very real health challenges we face today is not, as so much of MAHA wants, to destroy the foundation of the public health achievements we enjoy today, but rather to build on them.

            Former Manchester United and Portugal winger Luís Nani has an encouraging message of hope for the Red Devils' beleaguered fans: Things are about to get a whole lot better.
    


            United recently endured its worst ever finish to a Premier League season and already in this campaign, Ruben Amorim's men have suffered a humiliating League Cup defeat to fourth-division Grimsby Town despite the acquisition of expensive new forwards Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Šeško.
    


            And now since that loss, young Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens has been added to the squad.
    


            “Everyone is expecting the new players to shine, so the stress doesn't help,” Nani, a four-time Premier League winner with United, told CNN Sports ahead of this weekend's Manchester derby.
    


            “I believe, in a few games more, everything will settle, and we'll get the normal winning our games, really compete and be one of the best teams in the Premier League. We know we are one of the best clubs in the world, and we want to be there but what I can tell you for the moment, the expectation is so high,” he added.
    


            The club's current plight is a far cry from the Alex Ferguson glory days when United won a record 13 Premier League titles and was a two-time Champions League winner.
    


            A key member of that all-conquering history was flying winger Nani – a generational talent who was part of the Red Devils team that won the Champions League in 2008, and was inducted into Liga Portugal's Hall of Fame earlier this week.
    


‘Something has to change': Manchester United plunges to new low against fourth-division Grimsby Town



            A former international teammate of Amorim, Nani – who scored over 40 goals during his time in the Premier League – is well qualified to assess his compatriot's impact on United so far.
    


            “He's a great person, great coach. He's young and obviously needs to experience much more in the Premier League. The Premier League is not easy for any coach. But we know the passion from the fans and the time is making his life even worse, giving him so much stress, so much pressure to deliver it,” Nani said.
    


            “But I'm really confident in him.  The results will come out and Man United will be a team who will be at the top of the table fighting for the usual title.”
    


            2011 was a year to remember for Nani, especially when it came to scoring against rival Manchester City – netting twice against the Citizens in a Community Shield victory. Then in a later Premier League match, after scoring the opening goal of the game, he produced the cross for Wayne Rooney to score one of the most famous and iconic goals in the competition's history: an astonishing overhead bicycle kick that settled the derby 2-1 in United's favor.
    


            The two teams face each other again at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.
    


            “Playing in the derby is the most beautiful experience you can have in the Premier League, and especially when it's United against City. It's really nice, the team who wins the game, the next day, they can walk free in the city.  And then the colors of the team will be out, and the others will sit at home.  They will not come out,” Nani reflected.
    


            “I think Man United have a big opportunity to perform well, win the game, and get the confidence for the rest of the season because I think it will motivate all the fans, all the players. Everyone around the club will be ready for the next challenge,” he added.
    


            As far as this season's title race is concerned, Nani is already ruling out City.
    


            “They're a very consistent team, but this season, they didn't start very well,” he said. “And last season, they didn't play well. They lost the title as well. So, I don't see them winning the title, but it's always a team who will be there to compete and then make things difficult for any team on top of the table.”
    


            In addition to his United successes, Nani made history with the Portuguese national team becoming a European champion at EURO 2016; he would go on to make over 100 appearances for his nation.
    


            Nani was an exciting, skillful winger, and in the early part of his career in England, a one-time housemate of storied compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo.
    


            “For me, it's an honor today to be able to say I played on the side of the best players in the world,” said the now-38-year-old. “We experienced the best youth together in Man United. We were so young, and we had everything in our hands. Nice house, nice cars. We have the swimming pool. We have the tennis court to enjoy ourselves after our sessions at United. So, I think it was a great privilege to be part of those memories.”
    


            But the trappings of Nani's hard-earned success are a far cry from a difficult and challenging childhood in Amadora, a few miles outside of Lisbon. Despite having no food to eat on certain days, Nani nevertheless describes his childhood as a happy one.
    


            “Even with all the difficulties, having no food, not having clothes to dress in every single day – I had to sometimes wear clothes with holes in my jeans and shirts and my shoes – but even with all that, I was happy because I remember the only thing I wanted to do was to play football on the streets with my friends,” said Nani.

            In an emotional video, Nani announced his retirement from soccer in 2024 following a decorated career that spanned two decades, including spells in his homeland, Spain, Turkey, Italy, Australia and the US. Nani's decision to call time on his playing days was taken in part due to the passing of his father and a desire to spend more time with family.

Ever since a massive immigration raid on a Hyundai manufacturing site swept up nearly 500 workers in southeast Georgia, Rosie Harrison said her organization's phones have been ringing nonstop with panicked families in need of help. 

“We have individuals returning calls every day, but the list doesn't end,” Harrison said. She runs an apolitical non-profit called Grow Initiative that connects low-income families — immigrant and non-immigrant alike — with food, housing and educational resources. 

Since the raid, Harrison said, “families are experiencing a new level of crisis.” 

A majority of the 475 people who were detained in the workplace raid — which U.S. officials have called the largest in two decades — were Korean and have returned to South Korea. But lawyers and social workers say many of the non-Korean immigrants ensnared in the crackdown remain in legal limbo or are otherwise unaccounted for.

As the raid began the morning of Sept. 4, workers almost immediately started calling Migrant Equity Southeast, a local nonprofit that connects immigrants with legal and financial resources. The small organization of approximately 15 employees fielded calls regarding people from Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador and Venezuela, spokesperson Vanessa Contreras said. 

Throughout the day, people described federal agents taking cellphones from workers and putting them in long lines, Contreras said. Some workers hid for hours to avoid capture, in air ducts or remote areas of the sprawling property. The Department of Justice said some hid in a nearby sewage pond.

People off-site called the organization frantically seeking the whereabouts of loved ones who worked at the plant and were suddenly unreachable. 




Like many of the Koreans who were working at the plant, advocates and lawyers representing the non-Korean workers caught up in the raid say that some who were detained had legal authorization to work in the United States.

Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded to emailed requests for comment Friday. It is not clear how many people detained during the raid remain in custody.

Atlanta-based attorney Charles Kuck, who represents both Korean and non-Korean workers who were detained, said two of his clients were legally working under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was created by former President Barack Obama. One had been released and “should have never been arrested,” he said, while the other was still being held because he was recently charged with driving under the influence.

Another of Kuck's clients was in the process of seeking asylum, he said, and had the same documents and job as her husband who was not arrested. 

Some even had valid Georgia driver's licenses, which aren't available to people in the country illegally, said Rosario Palacios, who has been assisting Migrant Equity Southeast. Some families who called the organization were left without access to transportation because the person who had been detained was the only one who could drive. 

“It's hard to say how they chose who they were going to release and who they were going to take into custody,” Palacios said, adding that some who were arrested didn't have an alien identification number and were still unaccounted for.

Kuck said the raid is an indication of how far-reaching the crackdown by President Donald Trump's administration is, despite assurances that they are targeting criminals. 

“The redefinition of the word ‘criminal' to include everybody who is not a citizen, and even some that are, is the problem here,” Kuck said. 

Many of the families who called Harrison's initiative said their detained relatives were the sole breadwinners in the household, leaving them desperate for basics like baby formula and food.

The financial impact of the raid at the construction site for a battery factory that will be operated by HL-GA Battery Co. was compounded by the fact that another massive employer in the area — International Paper Co. — is closing at the end of the month, laying off another 800 workers, Harrison said. 

Growth Initiative doesn't check immigration status, Harrison said, but almost all families who have reached out to her have said that their detained loved ones had legal authorization to work in the United States, leaving many confused about why their relative was taken into custody in the first place. 

“The worst phone calls are the ones where you have children crying, screaming, ‘Where is my mom?'” Harrison said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — There's bipartisan support in Congress for extending tax credits that have made health insurance more affordable for millions of people since the COVID-19 pandemic. But the credits are in danger of expiring as Republicans and Democrats clash over how to do it. 

Democrats are threatening to vote to shut down the government at the end of the month if Republicans don't extend the subsidies, which were first put in place in 2021 and extended a year later when they controlled Congress and the White House. The tax credits, which are slated to expire at the end of the year, go to low- and middle-income people who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.

Some Republicans who have opposed the health care law since it was enacted under President Barack Obama are suddenly open to keeping the tax credits. They acknowledge that many of their constituents could see steep hikes in coverage if the subsidies are allowed to lapse. 

Still, the two sides are far apart. Republicans are divided, with many firmly opposed. GOP leaders in the House and Senate have been open but noncommittal on the extension, and many of those Republicans who say they support it argue that the tax credits should be reworked — potentially opening up a new health care debate that could take months to resolve. 

Democrats would be unlikely to agree to any changes in the subsidies, increasing the chances of a standoff and mounting uncertainty for health insurers, hospitals, state governments and the people who receive them. 

“In just a few weeks, unless Congress acts, millions of Americans will start getting letters in the mail telling them their health insurance costs are about to go through the roof — hundreds of dollars, thousands in some cases,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said this past week. 

Enrollment in ACA plans has surged to a record 24 million people in large part due to the billions of dollars in subsidies that have lowered costs for many people. The expanded subsidies allowed some lower income enrollees to access health plans with no premiums and capped the amount higher earners pay for premiums to 8.5% of their income. It also expanded eligibility for middle-class earners. 

With expiration now just a few months away, some of those people have already gotten notices that their premiums — the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage — are poised to spike next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50 percent. 

Lawmakers are facing pressure to act from some of the country's biggest industries, including the insurers that cover people on the marketplace and hospital executives who say they're already going to be squeezed by the Medicaid cuts in President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful” tax bill. 

“There's broad awareness that there's a real spike and premiums coming right around the corner, both Republicans and Democrats,” said David Merritt, senior vice president of external affairs at Blue Cross Blue Shield. “It's certainly lining up for Congress to have an opportunity to head off this problem.”

Companies have said they'll need to raise premiums without the subsidies because healthier and younger people are more likely to opt out of coverage when it gets more expensive, leaving insurers to cover older and sicker patients.

In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37% against a stream of angry public comments. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.

“I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,” the woman, LuAnn, wrote in a public comment published to the commissioner's website.

On Capitol Hill, the issue has become entangled in a larger fight over government funding as a shutdown looms at the end of the month. Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries have said Democrats will not vote to keep the government open unless an extension of the health care tax credits is part of the deal. Republicans have said that they want more time to look at the subsidies and potentially scale them back. They will also have to wait for a signal from Trump, who has not yet weighed in. 

Jeffries said this past week that “we will not support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to rip away health care from the American people.” 

Republican leaders are eyeing a potential stopgap bill that would keep the government open for a few weeks and are unlikely, for now, to include the extension. But GOP leaders in both the House and Senate are also under pressure from some members who worry that premium increases will be a political liability before the midterm elections. 

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has said he wants to see a proposal from Democrats on how to extend the subsidies since they are pushing the issue. “Maybe there is something we can do in the middle as a solution,” he said in a Punchbowl News interview on Thursday, adding that his members are divided on the issue. 

Still, Thune has ruled out quick action, even as he noted that premium notices will go out soon. He has said a short-term spending measure to fund the government for several weeks while Congress finishes its budget bills is not likely to include an extension of the benefits, 

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said that many of his members would oppose an extension, but has not ruled it out. 

In recent days, 15 House Republicans in competitive political districts introduced legislation to extend the tax credits for one year. “While the enhanced premium tax credit created during the pandemic was meant to be temporary, we should not let it expire without a plan in place,” said Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., who led the effort with Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y.

Middle-class and small business owners, like the ones who dot Kiggan's coastal Virginia district, will be especially vulnerable to big health insurance hikes if the subsidies are not extended. 

Several Senate Republicans also said they'd favor an extension. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley said that if Congress doesn't act, some premiums will “skyrocket, and not by a little bit. We're looking at massive increases. People will not be able to afford it.”

Texas Sen. John Cornyn said he thinks Congress should scale back the subsidies for the highest income people who receive them. “I think we all know that access to health care is important and we take it very seriously,” he said. 

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, who has jurisdiction over the tax credits, said he's working with his colleagues to figure out if there is a solution. “There are a lot of ideas being thrown out there,” Crapo said. “I'm trying to find a solution, I'm not telling you what the solution is.” 

Others were firmly against it. “It's costing us billions of dollars,” said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. 

Open enrollment begins Nov. 1 and people will begin to see “real sticker shock,” as ACA plan prices are posted next month, said Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.

“Timing is important,” Baldwin said.

            Utah Gov. Spencer Cox's campaign to turn down the nation's political temperature has long stood out as a rarity in a Republican Party led by President Donald Trump.
    


            But Cox's commanding role as the nation grapples with the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk gives his calls to end the cycle of violent division a new prominence.
    


            It also laid bare a sharp divide within the GOP over the way forward, even as prominent Democrats and some Republicans praised Cox's performance before a national audience Friday.
    


            Cox said Americans faced a decision: “Is this the end of a dark chapter of our history, or the beginning?”
    


            Among those who count Cox as a close friend is Wes Moore, Maryland's Democratic governor. Moore said he thought Cox had shown “the importance of being authentic.”
    


            “Spencer Cox is Spencer Cox,” Moore told CNN on Friday. “And he doesn't change depending on who the audience is, and he doesn't change depending on who he's standing in front of. And that's one of the things I love about him most.”
    


            “He's just a deeply good human being,” he added, “and I'm thankful that in this moment of real tension in our country, that Spencer is helping to lead us through.”
    


            Cox implored the country to dedicate themselves to end a cycle of violent division, echoing his longstanding calls for civility in the nation's political discourse and urging people to “disagree better.”
    


            “I desperately call on every American – Republican, Democrat, liberal, progressive, conservative, MAGA, all of us – to please, please, please follow what Charlie taught me,” Cox said Friday, sharing a lesson he recounted from Kirk: “Always forgive your enemies – nothing annoys them so much.”
    


            While the governor has built a strong conservative record, he has faced at times sharp criticism from Trump-aligned Republicans. The disconnect raises the question of whether there is truly an audience inside the GOP for the type of message Cox has sought to deliver.
    


            In 2022, as Cox was about to veto a ban on transgender youth athletes playing in girls' sports, Kirk tweeted: “Utah Governor Spencer Cox should be expelled from the Republican party.” Cox wrote in his message to legislative leaders that he had tried “to err on the side of kindness, mercy and compassion.” Still, the legislature overrode his veto.
    


            Steve Bannon, the Kirk and Trump ally, alluded to that veto on his “War Room” podcast Friday and called Cox “a governor who's also known, I think, to be particularly obnoxious.”
    


            “We don't need a governor to step up and give us basically a political pep talk and a rally and ‘let's just all come together,'” Bannon said.
    


            Underscoring the divisions among conservatives, Utah Sen. John Curtis, a Republican, sounded similar notes to his state's governor Friday on CNN.
    


            “Somehow, as a society, we need to figure out how to turn down the dial,” Curtis said. “Every one of us, every morning, should wake up, look in the mirror, and see what we are doing in our own personal relationships.”
    


            Cox on Friday did not directly address Trump's earlier suggestion of blaming the “radical left” for Kirk's murder. Yet his words stood in stark contrast to the president's.
    


            Despite leading one of the nation's reddest states, Cox has not followed most of the party in aligning himself closely with Trump.
    


            Cox supported Marco Rubio in 2016 before switching his endorsement to Ted Cruz in the final stretch of the Republican presidential primary. At the time, he said he could not support Trump, saying: “He does not represent neither goodness nor kindness.”
    


            A member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Cox frequently spoke out against Trump's behavior and rhetoric. He built a political brand that extended beyond party labels.
    


            In the final stretch of his 2020 campaign for governor, Cox cut an ad with his Democratic opponent in which the two vowed to respect the outcome of the presidential election, and said they wanted Utah to serve as an example for the nation.
    


            “Although we sit on different sides of the aisle, we are both committed to American civility and a peaceful transition of power,” Cox said in the ad.
    


            He didn't endorse Trump last year until after the assassination attempt on the then-former president's life in Butler, Pennsylvania.
    


            “Because of that miracle,” Cox said, “you have the opportunity to do something that no other person on earth can do right now: unify and save our country.”
    


            Cox has spent years urging Americans to embrace a more civil approach to politics and disagreement.
    


            As chairman of the National Governors Association, he launched the “Disagree Better” initiative aimed at encouraging civility. He's filmed videos with Democratic governors to encourage Americans to disagree with each other without vitriol. One alongside Colorado Gov. Jared Polis featured Cox saying the two were “here to help save your family dinners.” Another, with Moore, featured the two discussing their love for basketball and joking about their own baldness.
    


            “Politics is important, but it shouldn't define us or destroy our relationships,” Cox says in the video.
    


            Cox and Moore were together last week for a National Press Club lunch, where they discussed the inevitability of crises that governors face. Moore's came last March, when the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed. Cox's came days after that conversation.
    


            Moore said he reached out to Cox as soon as he heard about Kirk's assassination, and the two have spoken every day since.
    


            “I prayed for him,” Moore said. “And then I just told him, I said, ‘Listen, the only thing I ask is, just make sure you're taking care of yourself, because your people are going to need you right now.'”
    


            Cox on Friday also renewed his call for all Americans, particularly the nation's youth, to disengage from social media and forge a connection with whom they agree and disagree.
    


            “You are inheriting a country where politics feels like rage. It feels like rage is the only option,” Cox said. “Your generation has an opportunity to build a culture that is very different than what we are suffering through right now, not by pretending differences don't matter but by embracing our differences and having those hard conversations.”
    


            Cox described social media as “a cancer,” and urged those watching to “log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member, go out and do good in your community.”
    


            That comment won the Utah governor plaudits from one of the Senate's more liberal and online Democratic voices. Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz posted on X: “I know this guy is a Republican and all but I swear you could win all the electoral votes with this message in 28.”
    


            Curtis, the Republican senator, said Cox's urging of Americans to sign off social media was “one of the wisest things I think he said today.”
    


            Cox also drew praise from conservative media outlets for his highlighting of Utah's reaction to Kirk's death. “There was no rioting. There was no looting. There were no cars set on fire. There was no violence. There were vigils and prayers and people coming together to share the humanity,” he said.
    


            Moore, often mentioned as a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender himself, said if Cox — who won a hard-fought 2020 gubernatorial primary — wants to run for the White House, he shouldn't be underestimated.
    


            “Anyone who thinks that his message could not resonate in the Republican Party, I think you're underestimating the hunger the country has for unified leadership — for a person who brings us together rather than tearing us apart,” Moore said. “And I think you're also underestimating Spencer Cox.”

            Facebook users who filed a claim in parent company Meta's $725 million settlement related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal may soon get a payment.
    


            It's been over two years since Facebook users were able to file claims in Meta's December 2022 settlement. The class-action lawsuit began after the social media giant said in 2018 that as many as 87 million Facebook users' private information was obtained by data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, which had worked with President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.
    


            Meta was accused of allowing Cambridge Analytica and other third parties, including developers, advertisers and data brokers, to access private information about Facebook users. The social media giant was also accused of insufficiently managing third-party access to and use of user data.
    


            Meta did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Following the Cambridge Analytica incident, Facebook restricted third-party access to user data and “developed more robust tools” to inform users about how data is collected and shared, according to court documents.
    


            Here's what you need to know about the settlement payments.
    


            Any US Facebook user who had an active account between May 24, 2007, and December 22, 2022, was eligible to file a claim, even if they have deleted the account.
    


            The deadline to file was August 25, 2023. Almost 29 million claims were filed and about 18 million were validated as of September 2023, according to Meta's response in a 2024 legal document.
    


            According to the settlement site, payments would be determined by whether a claim was valid and “how long you were a user on Facebook” between May 24, 2007, and December 22, 2022. Those who did not file a claim are ineligible to receive a payment.
    


            Two appeals were filed after the settlement that were not resolved until May 14, 2025, according to the settlement site.
    


            The settlement was finalized on May 22, 2025, and on August 27, the court ordered that settlement benefits be distributed.
    


            “The distribution of settlement benefits has commenced and will continue for approximately 10 weeks. We thank you in advance for your patience,” according to the site's September 3 update.
    


            Approved claims are notified by email up to four days before their payouts are issued.
    


            Anyone who is unsure about the status of their claim can contact the settlement administrator at info@facebookuserprivacysettlement.com, with their claim ID.
    


            Of the $725 million settlement fund, roughly $540 million will cover approved settlement claims. 



            According to the settlement plan, a system of “allocation points” will determine payments. One allocation point is assigned for each calendar month a person had a Facebook account between May 24, 2007, and December 22, 2022.
    


            “Class members who were active on Facebook longer, and who therefore may have more valuable claims, will receive a larger share of the settlement,” Meta said in the 2024 legal document.
    


            Payments will either be sent directly to the bank account provided on the claim form, or via PayPal, a virtual prepaid Mastercard, Venmo or Zelle. Unsuccessful or expired payments will receive a “second chance email” to update the payment method.

White House adviser Stephen Miller says the late Charlie Kirk's last message to him was to “dismantle” the radical left.

Miller says that he will oblige with Kirk's request.

“The last message that Charlie Kirk gave to me before he joined his creator in heaven was he said that we have to dismantle and take on the radical left organizations in this country that are fomenting violence. That was the last message that he sent me … we are gonna do that,” Miller told Fox News.

Miller said he and the administration would “do what it takes” to punish the radical left. He said they could use RICO or conspiracy charges to punish chosen individuals.

An assassin shot and killed Kirk earlier this week as he spoke to a group of college students at a Utah university. His alleged killer, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, has been captured by authorities and charged with aggravated murder, obstruction of justice, and felony discharge of a firearm.

He wrote several messages on bullet casings, according to law enforcement and Utah Governor Spencer Cox, including on the casing of the bullet that killed Kirk: “notices bulge OwO what's this?”

The inscription appeared to be a reference to internet culture. Another said, “Hey fascist! Catch!”

President Donald Trump vowed to go after the radical left, among other things, in a speech from the Oval Office.

“Charlie was a patriot to my great fellow Americans. I am filled with grief and anger at the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk on a college campus in Utah. Charlie inspired millions, and tonight, all who knew him and loved him are united in shock and horror,” he began his address, later calling him a “martyr for truth and freedom.”

“My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it, as well as those who go after our judges, law enforcement officials, and everyone else who brings order to our country,” he said, going on to reference the assassination attempts against himself and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) and the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Some have mocked or celebrated Kirk's death, and the federal government has vowed to pursue those who have done so to discipline them.

Secretary of War Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon is actively searching for Kirk detractors or those who celebrated his death to impose punishment.

DEMOCRATS MUM ON GUN CONTROL BUT CONDEMN POLITICAL VIOLENCE AFTER CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSINATION

“We are tracking all these very closely — and will address, immediately. Completely unacceptable,” Hegseth said in response to Pentagon Assistant to the Secretary of Public Affairs Sean Parnell.

After a historic drought that paralyzed vessel transits through the Panama Canal, the Panama Canal Authority is moving ahead with major investments in new infrastructure to mitigate future droughts and the risk of low water levels that in recent years plagued the key global trade gateway.

The Panama Canal depends on fresh water for its operations and is rainfall dependent.

"We use about two and a half times the amount of water a city of the size of New York uses for the canal operation," Ricaurte Vásquez, Administrator of the Panama Canal Authority, told CNBC.

In a good year of rain, that means over 50 vessel transits through the canal's locks a day, but in recent years, weather has not cooperated. Severe drought conditions hit the region from late 2022 to 2024, forcing the canal to reduce transits and put in place vessel weight restrictions in an effort to conserve water.

The canal is critical to the U.S. economy and trade. The U.S. is the largest user of the Panama Canal, with total U.S. commodity export and import containers representing about 73% of Panama Canal traffic, and 40% of all U.S. container traffic traveling through the Panama Canal every year. In all, roughly $270 billion in cargo is handled annually.

In April, Canal administration began the pre-qualification and selection process for concessionaires to build a land bridge, including what it describes as a flagship natural gas pipeline line to move natural gas liquids (NGLs) without relying on the canal itself. A road connecting both Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as port terminals built on either coast, would also be constructed, with the terminals also able to accommodate containers and roll-on and roll-off cargo.

The pipeline would allow for the transport of liquified petroleum gas, ethane, butane, and propane from the Atlantic side to a Pacific-side terminal, where another vessel would be loaded and carry the product to Asia. Canal officials hope this will attract more LNG transits through the canal.

The Panama Canal Authority reported a 29% drop in vessel transits during fiscal year 2024, with the biggest hits in LNG and dry bulk transits. LNG transits were down 66 percent, while dry bulk transits were down 107 percent.

Even though water levels are back to regular operating conditions, LNG traffic has not returned to pre-drought transit activity, with carriers continuing to choose the longer route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, according to S&P Global data.

Vasquez tells CNBC that U.S. energy companies are "drooling at the possibilities" of this alternative way to move the commodity. Transit time-wise, Vasquez said the pipeline would be competitive versus traversing the canal, and reliability would be higher because it is now water-dependent. "This is important because with many of these products, reliability and delivering on time are critical," he said.

"We decided to do a land bridge to complement the waterway," Vásquez said. "We are aware that these are high-value products that have a destination in Asia," he said, noting the project was announced in Tokyo, which is the largest buyer of these energy products.

Another project approved is the building of the Rio Indo dam. The dam and tunnel project would add supplemental water for Lake Gatun, which feeds fresh water to the Panama Canal in order to operate. The older Panamax locks lose approximately 50-52 million gallons of fresh water per vessel transit. The newer, Neo-Panamax locks reclaim approximately 60% of the water per transit.

Construction for the dam is expected to begin in 2027 and would not be completed until 2032, with a cost estimated at $1.6 billion. Included in that cost is $400 million allocated for compensating and relocating about 2,500 residents from various communities whose villages would be flooded to create the dam.

CNBC was the first television crew to go to one of the villages that would be impacted by the project, and villagers who spoke with CNBC said they did not want to leave.

Neither project will be finished by the time the next El Niño weather phenomenon is expected, in 2027. Vasquez tells CNBC that some of the elements of the land bridge will be completed, but the pipeline is not expected to be completed until 2030-2031.

As the search unfolded for conservative political activist Charlie Kirk's assassin, with the suspect identified on Friday as Tyler Robinson, law enforcement parsed every possible lead. One piece of evidence they homed in on: a forearm print taken from the sniper's position.

Before Robinson's apprehension Friday morning as a result of very human methods — it has been reported that Robinson offered what may have been a form of confession to family members, who then shared the information, leading to his surrender — FBI agent Robert Bohls said investigators had collected a "footwear impression, a palm print and forearm imprints" from the crime scene for analysis.

Forearm imprints are not a commonly collected piece of evidence, according to experts CNBC spoke with.

"It's very unusual," said Patrick McClain, a Texas-based criminal defense attorney and retired Marine Corps military judge. McClain explained that typically, when a forearm print is mentioned, authorities have collected DNA or other skin residue from the surface against which the forearm was pressed.

"It's merely a mold from an imprint left from remaining in a prone shooting position with forearms on the deck for a period of time," said Jeff Wenninger, founder and CEO of Law Enforcement Consultants, who has worked with the LAPD's elite Metropolitan Division and with the Secret Service in protecting dignitaries. "It would be similar to a shoe or boot print that they lift with a mold," he added.

Wenninger says that a forearm print can be used to corroborate identification purposes, such as unique characteristics like scarring or the imprint of known clothing worn.

"Like fingerprints, a forearm print can be unique enough for identification if it's of sufficient quality," he said.

It could also have a forensic value if biological material like sweat, body oils, or touch DNA can be recovered, and along with other evidence, it can corroborate or contradict witness statements or video footage.

New technology is giving the forearm a wider window into a possible suspect. Physical impressions have been utilized in forensic investigations for years, Wenninger said, but in recent years, the methodologies for identifying and comparing specific meaningful markings have evolved, and the scanning technology for analyzing imprints has improved so much that "it seems new." 

3D scanning has revolutionized this science, turning the forearm print into a reservoir of previously untapped information. An imprint alone cannot determine factors such as ethnicity and gender, and investigators would still be reliant on whether DNA or other biological evidence has been obtained from the imprint.

"It's a newer exploration in forensics, including other skin prints. But it's not like a finger/palm print that is 100% unique," said Toby Braun, CEO and Founder of American Special Investigative Group, which specializes in executive protection, threat-intelligence monitoring, and complex investigations.

According to Braun, a forearm print won't ID a person from a database like a fingerprint would. "A forearm print is not considered a primary form of forensic evidence in the same way that a fingerprint is," he said.

A forearm print isn't a primary form of evidence because there can be ambiguity, according to Braun. For example, while the friction ridges on fingers and palms are unique to each individual, the skin on the forearm does not possess the same detailed, permanent, and individualized ridge patterns.

The difficulty with forearm residue is that even in the most high-profile cases, any DNA would take a while to get results from, and that if the person is not in a known database, it won't be beneficial until there is an arrest. "There are not going to have been too many people on the roof of the building," McClain said. "But it is not like a fingerprint; there is no unique structure to everyone's forearm."

According to McClain, there have been cases tried with forearm prints if there is something unique, such as a tattoo or scarring pattern, "but I have never done one of those cases; they are definitely unusual," he said.

As in any manhunt, in the hours after the shooting, the focus was on finding the shooter and making an arrest. "Additional evidence for the strongest possible case will be developed subsequently as the investigation is still ongoing," Braun said, adding that authorities just need probable cause for an arrest, and evidence beyond a reasonable doubt is for a trial. "But that is developed as the case progresses," he added.

Dan Gerl, founder and managing attorney at Next Law, says that for a forearm's "pattern" to be lifted or photographed as evidence, the subject would have had to apply sufficient pressure upon a receptive surface area and that the prints are most useful as supporting evidence rather than primary, such as to support a request for a search warrant seeking additional evidence.

"Under certain circumstances, forearm prints can also be admissible in court. Like all scientific evidence, forearm prints would have to be admitted by a qualified expert's testimony, and pass the court's tests for reliability," Gerl said. This type of forensic evidence would likely encounter more procedural hurdles to clear before being admitted at trial, he added.

Robinson was arrested on suspicion of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, and obstruction of justice by police. Prosecutors will ultimately decide the charges he faces before the court, which are expected to be filed on Tuesday.

In the end, the arrest of Tyler Robinson came down to human rather than forensic connections, and some criminal experts say a defining feature of recent political violence is a killer's underlying desire to be caught rather than meticulously plan and evade capture.

Bryanna Fox, a former FBI special agent and professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, says advances in crime technology have been notable over the past two decade, and some criminals may not be aware of the level of forensics available to law enforcement. "He may have thought, 'Oh, I can leave my forearm prints and it won't amount to anything," Fox said.

But she thinks that another mindset may have been at work. Comparing the Robinson case to the case of Luigi Mangione, who assassinated a United Healthcare executive last year, Fox thinks ideologically driven criminals may care more about sending a message than about escaping consequences for their crimes.

That means they may not be thinking about the trail of evidence they leave behind as much as some other criminals, whether prints, covering their face, or how they dispose of a weapon. "The attention helps give more oxygen to what an ideologue wants to say," Fox said. "In a way they are sort of stipulating to the fact that they will get caught and are OK with leaving some evidence. They don't want to get caught right away, but their main mission is to achieve the goal, which is to kill their target," she added.

President Donald Trump said Saturday he is "ready to do major Sanctions on Russia" once all NATO countries have started "to do the same thing" and pause their purchases of oil from Moscow.

He also urged NATO countries to impose "50% to 100% TARIFFS ON CHINA," which he said should be withdrawn after the Russia-Ukraine war has concluded.

"China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia, and these powerful Tariffs will break that grip," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post, which he said was the text of a letter sent to all NATO nations and "the world."

Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, but has so far held off from doing so.

Earlier this month, the president said he was prepared to move towards a second phase of sanctioning Russia, but has not yet imposed the levies.

Part of Trump's reluctance to impose the strict economic punishments may be in part because he hopes he can broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, analysts previously told CNBC.

"The second reason ... is there is a sense that if Russia is defeated ... then it has no choice but to go even further all-in with China, and that potentially then would strengthen China's position," Chris Weafer, the chief executive of Moscow-based Macro-Advisory, told CNBC earlier this month.

Trump's Saturday post underscores that he is shifting his focus to NATO nations to put pressure on Russia to end its war.

"As you know, NATO'S commitment to WIN has been far less than 100%, and the purchase of Russian Oil, by some, has been shocking!" Trump wrote in the post.

"It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia," he continued.

Hungary and Slovakia have continued to buy Russian fossil fuels, drawing criticism from Trump officials.

"We want to displace all Russian gas. President Trump, America, and all the nations of the EU, we want to end the Russian-Ukraine war," U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said Friday.

Inflation has picked up since President Donald Trump announced new import tariffs in April, with the latest consumer price index data showing outsized increases in tariff-sensitive categories, including coffee, toys and televisions.

Overall prices rose 2.9% in August from a year earlier, up from 2.7% in June and July, according to CPI data released Thursday. The CPI measures the cost of a broad basket of everyday goods and services, including groceries, rent and medical care.

That leaves inflation drifting farther from the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.4% in August, the biggest monthly gain since January, and is up 3.1% from a year earlier.

Taken together, this means more pressure on everyday household spending.

Although Trump's sweeping tariffs were first announced in April, the effects have shown up unevenly since goods move through supply chains at different rates and imports make up a larger share for some products than others.

Even so, they still have a "significant impact on prices," according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

Take bananas, for example. Prices climbed 4.9% from April through August — equivalent to an annualized pace of about 15% — a notable jump for a category that rarely sees much inflation. Virtually all U.S. supply comes from Central and South America and is now subject to a 10% tariff.

Bananas aren't the only industry affected. The Fed's Beige Book survey in August said all regions were seeing tariff-related price increases, spanning sectors from food and retail to manufacturing and health care, with many businesses reporting they've started to pass those costs on to consumers.

Overall, Americans now face an average tariff rate of 17.4% — the highest since 1935 — an increase estimated to cost households an extra $2,300 in 2025, according to the Yale Budget Lab. (These estimates include tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which remain in place while the court challenge is pending).

To get a sense of where else inflation has been heading, here's a look at five of the most-impacted products since April, compared with their historical norms for the same time period over the last 10 years.

Coffee prices jumped 9.8% from April to August, including a 3.6% spike last month. Poor harvests earlier this year had already tightened supply, but prices rose dramatically faster after new import tariffs took effect.

Since the U.S. grows less than 1% of the coffee it consumes, the market is especially exposed to import duties. Global tariffs that started at 10% in April were later raised sharply on major suppliers like Vietnam and Indonesia.

Brazil — which supplies more than a third of the U.S.'s arabica beans — was hit with a 50% duty on Aug. 6. That late move could keep coffee prices climbing in the months ahead, industry groups say.

Jewelry and watch prices surged 5.5% in August, far above their historical average monthly gain of 0.8%.

The U.S. relies heavily on imports for luxury jewelry and its components, and since April a 10% tariff has been broadly applied to this category.

But rates have gone higher still. On Aug. 7, the U.S. raised tariffs on all Swiss imports — including watches — to 39%, far above the baseline. Switzerland supplies more than 90% of the U.S.'s imported precious-metal wristwatches, per the Wall Street Journal.

The U.S. has also extended tariffs to India, a leading supplier of cut and synthetic diamonds, and to Japan, which exports premium mechanical watches to the U.S. Those additional levies could push jewelry and watch prices higher in the coming months.

Normally a stable category in the CPI, bananas saw an unusually sharp 4.9% increase between April and August. With virtually all supply imported from Central and South America, the U.S. market is directly exposed to tariffs, including the 10% across-the-board duty imposed in April.

Bananas remain cheap compared with most fruits and vegetables, with a reputation for long-running price stability. Reflective of that stability, Trader Joe's held its banana price at 19 cents each for more than two decades, only raising it to 23 cents in early 2024.

Television prices edged up 2.5% in August and are up 3.1% since April. 

While the increase might seem modest, television prices have been on a downward trajectory since the late 1990s. Manufacturing efficiencies and the rise of "smart" TVs that generate revenue from advertising and data collection have helped drive sticker prices lower.

Nearly all TVs sold in the U.S. are imported, mainly from Mexico, China and Vietnam. Imports from Mexico can face tariffs of up to 25%, depending on compliance with USMCA rules, while some shipments from China face rates as high as 30% and Vietnamese TVs generally face a 20% duty.

The summer run up in prices stands out as a break from the usual pattern for a product that typically gets cheaper over time.

Toy prices rose 2.5% between April and August, the steepest four-month gain since 2021.

Like TVs, toys are largely manufactured abroad, with roughly 70% of U.S. imports coming from China. Tariff classifications are not always clear, but many Chinese toy imports could be subject to tariffs around 30%, depending on classification, while some shipments from Vietnam may be taxed at higher rates.

The increase is notable because toy prices have been on a long downward trajectory.

In this article

(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday in your inbox.)

UnitedHealth Group shares have soared almost 30% since Berkshire Hathaway's disclosure in mid-August that it had purchased a bit more than 5 million shares between April 1 and June 30.

Minutes before that SEC filing, UNH closed at $271.49. On Friday, it ended trading at $352.51.

Although UNH had already started to bounce from its lowest close of the year of $237.77 on Aug. 1, Berkshire's endorsement of the troubled stock is responsible for at least a sizable chunk of its recent gains.

It is not clear, however, whether Berkshire's investment is profitable (on paper) at this point.

The current price is up just 13.0% since its $311.97 close at the end of Q2 on June 30.

We don't know exactly when Berkshire did its buying during the second quarter, so we can only look at a range of possible purchase prices.

(And, of course, it may have continued to buy in the third quarter. We won't know about that until mid-November.)

At Q2's high of $606.36 per share, Berkshire would have paid $3.1 billion for its stake, putting it 42% into the red.

At the low of $248.88, the 5 million shares would have cost less than $1.3 billion, giving it a 42% gain.

Using the average close for the period, the price comes in at $1.9 billion. Today's value of $1.8 billion is around 8% below that level.

Since Berkshire's buying was presumably triggered by the price slide early in the quarter, the actual purchase price is probably at the lower end of the range, but there still appears to be a significant chance the stake is the red, despite the stock's recent gains.

Berkshire & Co., however, are usually in it for the long haul, and there are some bullish signs for the stock, which is still down 30% year to date.

After meeting with UNH's management, analysts at Morgan Stanley said, "We are incrementally positive following discussions with UNH [management] where it had conviction in the turnaround."

On Friday, Morgan Stanley's Erin Wright raised her price target to $395 from $325.

And on Tuesday's "Lightning Round," CNBC's Jim Cramer said he doesn't like to buy stocks that are under investigation, but "there are some people who seem to know that the worst is over."

The outlook for a larger Berkshire stake, however, isn't as good.

Kraft Heinz shares fell another 4.25% this week after dropping more than 2% last week in the wake of its plan to split back into two companies, essentially reversing the 2015 merger that Warren Buffett helped organize.

In an unusual move for the normally passive investor, Buffett told CNBC he's "disappointed" the company went ahead with those plans, even though it knew he, representing KHC's largest shareholder, opposed a split.

CNBC.com's Yun Li quotes Gordon Haskett's Don Bilson as saying, "Beyond any worries that investors might have with the plan itself, they must also grapple with the possibility that Buffett will now dump his stock."

Because its stake is more than 10%, any sales would have to be reported publicly within two business days.

Warren Buffett is #9 on the just-released 2025 Forbes 400 list of the richest people in the United States.

That's down from #5 last year even through his estimated net worth remained unchanged at $150 billion.

While the price of Berkshire A shares, the source of almost all his net worth, increased almost 10% over the past year, Buffett donated stock then worth $6.0 billion this summer to the Gates Foundation and several family foundations.

Last fall, his Thanksgiving gifts to the family foundations totaled $1.1 billion.

If Buffett had held onto all the shares he's given away since 2006, he would now be worth approximately $350 billion.

That would put him in the #2 slot behind Elon Musk's $428 billion on the annual list, which uses stock values as of Sept. 9.

The next day, Oracle shares soared on a strong earnings report, adding around $100 billion to Larry Ellison's net worth. Tesla shares have also moved higher since then.

As a result, Buffett would be nearly tied with Ellison's $352 billion in our hypothetical real-time ranking, with Musk still well ahead at $463 billion.

Warren Buffett attended a party this week in New York to celebrate 30 years of CNBC's 'Squawk Box,' which premiered in 1995.

Jim Cramer posted a photo of himself with his "lifelong idol."

The widow of the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk has vowed to continue her husband's work following his death in Utah earlier this week.

Kirk, who cofounded the conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA, died after being shot during an event at Utah Valley University.

Speaking publicly for the first time since his killing, Erika Kirk said Friday that Turning Point's "American Comeback Tour" would continue over the fall and that the organization's annual "AmericaFest" conference would also go ahead in December.

"If you thought that my husband's mission was powerful before, you have no idea," she added. "You have no idea what you just have unleashed across this entire country."

A suspect in the fatal shooting is now in custody following a multi-day manhunt.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox confirmed remarks made by President Donald Trump on Friday morning that law enforcement had a suspect in custody.

"Ladies and gentlemen, we got him," Cox said during a Friday morning news conference.

Officials said the suspect was named Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old resident of Utah. Robinson was taken into custody in Washington County, which is roughly three and a half hours away from where Kirk was shot.

Cox said that family members and a friend helped turn Robinson in. A family member of Robinson said he had become "more political in recent years," he added.

"The family member referenced a recent incident in which Robinson came to dinner prior to September 10, and in that conversation with another family member, Robinson mentioned Charlie Kirk was coming to UVU," Cox said. "They talked about why they didn't like him and the viewpoints that he had. The family member also stated that Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate."

Investigators obtained casings near a Mauser .30-06 caliber bolt action rifle that was wrapped in a dark colored towel in a wooded area on Utah Valley University's campus. "The rifle had a scope mounted on top of it," Cox said.

A fired casing was inscribed, "Notices bulges OWO what's this?" Cox said that among the inscriptions on the unfired casing were the phrases, "Hey fascist! Catch!" adding that there were arrow symbols alongside the wording. Additional inscriptions on the unfired casings included, "If you read this you are gay LMAO."

Cox said that on Thursday evening, one of Robinson's family members reached out to a family friend with information that Robinson had "confessed to them or implied to them" that he had fatally shot Charlie Kirk. Once law enforcement had Robinson's name, Cox said officers were able to connect him to the crime scene.

Investigators reviewed campus security footage that showed Robinson arriving in a gray Dodge Challenger at roughly 8:29 am local time on September 10, the day Kirk was shot. Footage also showed Robinson wearing "a plain maroon T-shirt, light-colored shorts, a black hat with a white logo, and light-colored shoes."

"When encountered in person by investigators in Washington County on September 12 in the early morning hours, Robinson was observed in consistent clothing with those surveillance images," Cox said.

In addition to the family friend, Robinson's roommate showed law enforcement messages that the suspect had posted on the online platform Discord. In those messages, Cox said, Robinson said that he needed "to retrieve a rifle from the drop point." Other messages referred to having watched the area where the rifle was left.

FBI Director Kash Patel said the suspect was taken into custody on Thursday night at 10 p.m. Utah time.

President Donald Trump first announced on Friday during a "Fox & Friends" interview that a suspect was in custody.

Trump said that someone "very close to" the suspect had provided information to law enforcement that aided in his capture, adding the tipster was a "person involved with law enforcement, but was a person of faith. A minister."

In his remarks, Cox thanked "the family members of Tyler Robinson who did the right thing in this case and were able to bring him into law enforcement." He did not specify which family members were involved.

The manhunt for a suspect in Kirk's shooting extended multiple days and saw the FBI ask for the public's assistance in identifying a "person of interest" captured on camera.

"We are asking for the public's help identifying this person of interest in connection with the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University," the FBI's Salt Lake City field office wrote in a Thursday afternoon post on X.

The FBI also offered a $100,000 reward for information that leads to "the identification and arrest of the individual(s) responsible" for Kirk's death.

On Thursday, the agency released six photos of the person of interest as well as video footage. In the video's caption, the agency wrote that "the subject is seen jumping from the rooftop of a building after the shooting."

"Around 12 p.m. Mountain Time on September 10, 2025, the subject climbed up to a rooftop; after he shot and killed Charlie Kirk, he jumped off and ran away," the agency wrote.

The FBI added that the shooter had left a gun and ammunition in a wooded area near the university, and that officials had traced shoe impressions, a forearm imprint, and a palm print from the rooftop in the video.

Earlier in the day, authorities said they had recovered a "high-powered, bolt-action rifle" they believe was used to kill Kirk in a wooded area near the campus. The suspect was able to "blend in" well with the Utah Valley University crowd that had gathered to hear Kirk speak, they added.

Kirk was rushed to an area hospital after being shot in the neck but died from his injuries on Wednesday afternoon. President Donald Trump and scores of political and business leaders have praised Kirk's legacy of building youth support for the conservative movement.

Two persons of interest were initially taken into custody on Wednesday but were released after authorities determined they were not involved in Kirk's killing. Mason also asked people to stop harassing the two individuals who had since been released.

Trump said that he would posthumously award Kirk with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.

"Charlie was a giant of his generation, a champion of liberty, and an inspiration to millions and millions of people," Trump said during an event at the Pentagon marking the September 11th anniversary.

Oracle's historic stock surge this week marked the latest chapter in the story of a single private company that's dominated the tech landscape for almost three years: OpenAI.

In Oracle's blowout earnings report, OpenAI was a key catalyst due to a massive amount of money the artificial intelligence startup expects to spend on cloud computing technology in the coming years.

It's becoming a familiar theme.

A week earlier, Broadcom shares popped almost 10% after the chipmaker and software vendor said it forged a $10 billion deal to build custom processors for a customer that analysts said was OpenAI.

Among tech's megacaps, Microsoft has the closest link to OpenAI, having invested more than $13 billion in the company and serving as its key cloud partner for six years. Nvidia's march to becoming the world's most valuable company is intimately tied to OpenAI, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) sit at the heart of large language model development and are essential for running big AI workloads.

Those four companies alone — Oracle, Broadcom, Microsoft and Nvidia — have seen their combined market caps swell by over $4.5 trillion since OpenAI burst into public view with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. And those gains are a big reason why the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have sustained sharp rallies, with both benchmarks closing at a record on Friday.

OpenAI's outsized influence has some market experts understandably concerned. It remains a cash-burning startup that's governed by a nonprofit parent.

The company's $500 billion valuation is supported by a small number of investors betting that OpenAI will prevail in the face of hefty competition from the likes of Meta and Google as well as other highly-valued newcomers like Anthropic and any number of players out of China.

"While we love ChatGPT, OpenAI is still a not for profit limited in its ability to raise capital," said Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, in an interview with CNBC.

Luria, who recommends holding Oracle shares, dug into the company's numbers as the stock was in the midst of a 36% jump on Wednesday, its biggest gain since 1992.

In its quarterly earnings report late Tuesday, Oracle said it signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers during the period. One of those was with OpenAI, which said previously that it agreed to develop 4.5 gigawatts of U.S. data center capacity with Oracle.

Investors knew, based on a filing with the SEC in June, that Oracle signed a $30 billion cloud contract with an unnamed company that's set to begin in two years. CNBC confirmed a Wall Street Journal report from Wednesday that OpenAI has agreed to spend $300 billion in computing power over about five years, starting in 2027.

In the two trading days after its historic pop, Oracle's stock retreated, dropping more than 6% on Thursday and another 5% on Friday, as other investors began sharing Luria's concerns.

The new revelations about OpenAI's massive cloud commitment provided a clearer sense of Oracle's expanding backlog. Oracle said its performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, surged 359% from a year earlier to to $455 billion.

Luria said the concentration of Oracle's backlog with a single customer "significantly reduces" enthusiasm, particularly if "more than 90% came from OpenAI."

Oracle didn't respond to a request for comment.

OpenAI has made big commitments to several other cloud providers, including CoreWeave and Google, and reportedly plans to put $19 billion toward Stargate, a project President Donald Trump announced in January to bolster AI infrastructure investments in the U.S. Stargate is a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, which is separately leading a planned $40 billion investment in OpenAI.

Luria said the takeaway is that "Sam Altman has the gumption to sign very large checks without needing to worry about whether those can ever be cashed."

OpenAI declined to comment.

While OpenAI will be losing money for the foreseeable future, the company is expecting revenue growth to continue at a breakneck pace. After hitting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue in June, OpenAI is on pace for that number to reach $125 billion by 2029, CNBC confirmed.

And on Thursday, OpenAI got a step closer to formalizing its transition to a for-profit entity. The company said its nonprofit parent will continue to have oversight over the business and will own an equity stake of more than $100 billion as the commercial entity becomes a public benefit corporation.

OpenAI needs the restructuring to take place by year-end in order to secure the entirety of the $40 billion from its latest financing round.

For Oracle, the massive increase in OpenAI spending has landed the company within shouting distance of the trillion-dollar club, which currently includes eight tech peers. Oracle's market cap climbed to about $930 billion on Wednesday before retreating to $830 billion to close the week.

Byron Deeter, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, told CNBC's "Money Movers" that he's still skeptical of Oracle's prospects in AI. The company has spent years trying to play catchup in cloud infrastructure, where it trails Amazon, Microsoft and Google.

Deeter said Oracle remains a "B-level hyperscaler" without meaningful positions in AI software or chips.

"Two days ago, we all thought Oracle was essentially nowhere in AI," Deeter said, following the earnings report. "They announce this mega-deal, people think they're the next great hyperscaler – and I don't buy that part."

What's old is new again — and, sometimes, more expensive.

The resale market has reached new heights this year: One in three American luxury consumers has bought or sold on a resale platform, according to McKinsey's 2025 State of Luxury report.

And some shoppers are buying with an eye toward investment. Online thrift store ThredUp found in a survey about the secondhand market that 47% of shoppers considered the resale value of clothing before making a purchase.

A new report from luxury consignment shop The RealReal looks at which items have maintained their price over time.

While some trendy items — the Tiffany & Co. Bone Cuff or Row Margaux bag — have seen their resale prices skyrocket over the past few years, certain products are "classics" whose value "holds strong," the report said.

With tariffs causing luxury price increases, there's reason to believe their value will continue to climb on the secondhand market.

"The domestic closet, there's $200 billion trapped in there, and as pricing increases in the primary market, our pricing algorithms follow," The RealReal CEO Rati Sahi Levesque said on last month's earnings call. "We benefit and see pricing increase as well."

While even the CEO of Rolex urges against buying luxury goods purely as an investment, if you are keen on an accessory with an ROI, these five items have "consistent resale-value growth," The RealReal determined based on sales data since 2021.

Launched in 1930, the Louis Vuitton Speedy handbag — which has been made in numerous sizes and patterns over the decades — is an enduring silhouette.

The average sale price of a Speedy on The RealReal is up 13% since 2021.

The Louis Vuitton retail price of a brand-new Speedy starts at $1,920. On The RealReal, they are selling for between $380 and $13,500, with pricing dependent on the model, condition, and size.

Louis Vuitton is regularly among the most searched brands on The RealReal. This year it took the top spot, with searches for the Speedy, specifically, up 110%.

Birkin bags are largely considered the holy grail of luxury resale, with the handbag garnering an average of 4,000 searches a day on The RealReal.

The Birkin and its Hèrmes sister, the Kelly, represent "the most desirable — and exclusive — handbags on the market," Luca Solca, a senior analyst covering global luxury goods at Bernstein, wrote in a recent report. Given their long-standing appeal and limited availability, the bags command, on average, 1.7 times their retail price on the resale market, Bernstein found.

The average price of the Hermès Birkin 30, its most popular size, has increased 15% on The RealReal since 2021.

A new Birkin in that size starts at about $13,900 in the US if purchased from the designer. The RealReal's current selection ranges in price from $9,450 to $350,000.

The latter is for a rare Himalayan crocodile version with diamond-encrusted hardware. It's a hefty price, but not as much as the most expensive Birkin ever sold at The RealReal: a $385,000 model sold at its West Hollywood store.

The secondary watch market has become a popular asset class. While it has declined over the past few years, certain models and brands — particularly Rolex — have maintained impressive resale value.

The average resale price of the Rolex Datejust has increased 17% on The RealReal since 2021.

"The Datejust remains a timeless entry point, attracting both first-time buyers and seasoned collectors," Bob's Watches CEO Paul Altieri previously told Business Insider.

At retail, the model starts at $7,300. On The RealReal, it's available for between $4,000 — stainless steel and yellow gold — and $84,500 — white gold, mother of pearl, and diamonds.

Originally designed as a beach bag, the Goyard Saint Louis has become the status tote.

With a starting retail price of $1,890, the brand charges a pretty penny for its signature canvas product.

On The RealReal, where its average resale price has increased 18% since 2021, the bag is available for between $720 and $5,200.

Van Cleef & Arpels' four-leaf clover motif has been a signature of the brand for decades. Routinely called out on parent company Richemont's earnings calls, the Alhambra has become a worldwide status symbol.

"It's probably one of the most important jewelry lines in the world, but we feel it's far from having reached its full potential," Richemont CEO Nicolas Bos said in May.

Pieces from the line — which spans necklaces, rings, watches, earrings, and bracelets —  cost between $1,540 for a delicate bracelet with a single clover and $192,000 for a diamond necklace.

On The RealReal, prices for Alhambra pieces have increased 20% since 2021 and range from $1,425 to $165,000.

David Rosenberg isn't always right. The founder of Rosenberg Research, who rose to fame after calling the 2008 recession, regularly expresses a bearish outlook for the economy and markets that often don't come to fruition.

But in a world where bullish forecasts are the consensus among Wall Street's top equity strategists, it can be prudent to heed Rosenberg's warnings. While his predictions usually don't play out, there's no denying that the economist sufficiently shows his work, providing relevant data that ought to give investors pause.

In a recent note to clients, Rosenberg provided some concerning numbers on where the S&P 500's forward returns could be headed, given current valuations.

The index's Shiller cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio is hovering around 37.5. The measure smooths out business cycles by comparing current stock prices to a 10-year rolling average of earnings.

It's the third-most expensive level of all-time, behind peaks in 2021 and 2022.

Valuations are usually reliable predictors of long-term stock market performance. Bank of America data shows that starting valuations can explain about 80% of the market's performance over the following 10 years. Last year, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs strategists said that high valuations would lead to relatively weak returns for the market over the coming decade.

In the short term, valuations are poorer predictors of performance. Rosenberg's data, however, shows that when the market gets this historically expensive — though, granted, it has only happened twice before — one-year forward returns have been negative.

The column on the right in the table below shows forward returns over 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods when the Shiller CAPE ratio gets above 35.

"It's the only cutoff point where every single time is negative," Rosenberg said in an interview with Business Insider on Thursday.

Valuations alone aren't why Rosenberg is skeptical of the rally. It's the heightened expectations paired with a weakening economic backdrop as the labor market continues to show signs of slowing. Job growth has been below 100,000 per month over the past four months, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show. And the economy has added 911,000 fewer jobs than previously thought in the year through this March, the BLS said this week.

Rosenberg believes the outlook will continue to worsen.

He pointed to initial jobless claims rising to 263,000 last week, worse than economists expected and at levels that should trigger downward pressure on payroll growth. All of this adds up to the US economy already being in the midst of or on the precipice of a downturn, he said.

"What we know arithmetically is that the hiring rate today is so low that once you cross above 240,000 on claims, it triggers a negative impulse on nonfarm payrolls, which I think is what we're going to see when the September data roll out early October," he said.

The fact that stocks continue to punch through all-time highs despite these warning signs — showing heightened investor sentiment — is one clue that stocks are in bubble territory, Rosenberg said.

"This is what a euphoric state looks like we're seeing it in real time," he added. "We are in a gigantic price bubble that is ongoing. And you know it's a price bubble when prices move up in the face of negative fundamentals."

Germany this week played host to one of the world's biggest auto shows — but in the heartland of Europe's auto industry, it was buzzy Chinese electric car companies looking to outshine some of the region's biggest brands on their home turf.

The IAA Mobility conference in Munich was packed full of companies with huge stands showing off their latest cars and technology. Among some of the biggest displays were those from Chinese electric car companies, underscoring their ambitions to expand beyond China.

Europe has become a focal point for the Asian firms. It's a market where the traditional automakers are seen to be lagging in the development of electric vehicles, even as they ramp up releases of new cars. At the same time, Tesla, which was for so long seen as the electric vehicle market leader, has seen sales decline in the region.

Despite Chinese EV makers facing tariffs from the European Union, players from the world's second-largest economy have responded to the ramping up of competition by setting aggressive sales and expansion targets.

"The current growth of Xpeng globally is faster than we have expected," He Xiaopeng, the CEO of Xpeng told CNBC in an interview this week.

Chinese carmakers who spoke to CNBC at the IAA show signaled their ambitious expansion plans.

Xpeng's He said in an interview that the company is looking to launch its mass-market Mona series in Europe next year. In China, Xpeng's Mona cars start at the equivalent of just under $17,000. Bringing this to Europe would add some serious price competition.

Meanwhile, Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) is targeting rapid growth of its sales in Europe. Wei Haigang, president of GAC International, told CNBC that the company aims to sell around 3,000 cars in Europe this year and at least 50,000 units by 2027. GAC also announced plans to bring two EVs — the Aion V and Aion UT — to Europe. Leapmotor was also in attendance with their own stand. 

There are signs that Chinese players have made early in roads into Europe. The market share of Chinese car brands in Europe nearly doubled in the first half of the year versus the same period in 2024, though it still remains low at just over 5%, according to Jato Dynamics.

"The significant presence of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers at the IAA Mobility, signals their growing ambitions and confidence in the European market," Murtuza Ali, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.

Many of the Chinese car firms have positioned themselves as technology companies, much like Tesla, and their cars highlight that.

Many of the electric vehicles have big screens equipped with flashy interfaces and voice assistants. And in a bid to lure buyers, some companies have included additional gadgets.

For example, GAC's Aion V sported a refrigerator as well as a massage function as part of the seating.

This is one way that the Chinese players sought to differentiate themselves from legacy brands.

"The chances of success for Chinese automakers are strong, especially as they have an edge in terms of affordability, battery technology, and production scale," Counterpoint's Ali said.

Legacy carmakers sought to flex their own muscles at the IAA with Volskwagen, BMW and Mercedes having among the biggest stands at the show. Mercedes in particular had advertising displayed all across the front entrance of the event.

BMW, like the Chinese players, had a big focus on technology by talking up its so-called "superbrain architecture," which replaces hardware with a centralized computer system. BMW, which introduced the iX3 at the event, and chipmaker Qualcomm also announced assisted driving software that the two companies co-developed.

Volkswagen and French auto firm Renault also showed off some new electric cars.

Regardless of the product blitz, there are still concerns that European companies are not moving fast enough. BMW's new iX3 is based on the electric vehicle platform it first debuted two years ago. Meanwhile, Chinese EV makers have been quick in bringing out and launching newer models.

"A commitment to legacy structures and incrementalism has slowed its ability to build and leverage a robust EV ecosystem, leaving it behind fast moving rivals," Tammy Madsen, professor of management at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University, said of BMW.

While European autos have a strong brand history and their CEOs acknowledged and welcomed the competition this week in interviews with CNBC, the Chinese are not letting up.

"Europe's automakers still hold significant brand value and legacy. The challenge for them lies in achieving production at scale and adopting new technologies faster," Counterpoint's Ali said.

"The Chinese surely are not waiting for anyone to catch-up and are making significant gains."

Elon Musk's xAI laid off at least 500 workers on its data annotation team on Friday night.

The company sent out emails notifying employees that it was planning to downsize its team of generalist AI tutors, according to multiple messages viewed by Business Insider.

"After a thorough review of our Human Data efforts, we've decided to accelerate the expansion and prioritization of our specialist AI tutors, while scaling back our focus on general AI tutor roles. This strategic pivot will take effect immediately," the email read. "As part of this shift in focus, we no longer need most generalist AI tutor positions and your employment with xAI will conclude."

Workers were told that they would be paid through either the end of their contract or November 30, but their access to company systems would be terminated the day of the layoff notice.

The data annotation team is xAI's largest team. The workers play a key role in developing Grok by teaching the chatbot how to understand the world by contextualizing and categorizing raw data.

The main Slack room used by data annotators had more than 1,500 members on Friday afternoon; screenshots viewed by Business Insider Friday evening showed that number down to a little over 1,000, with that number continuing to decline over the course of reporting this story.

After publication, an xAI spokesperson pointed Business Insider to a company post on X saying it plans to "surge our Specialist AI tutor team by 10x," and sent a link to open roles on its careers page.

Specialist AI tutors at xAI are adding huge value.  We will immediately surge our Specialist AI tutor team by 10x!We are hiring across domains like STEM, finance, medicine, safety, and many more. Come join us to help build truth-seeking AGI!https://t.co/htpc2RijLG

The layoff notices were sent out only a few days after several senior-level employees, including the team's former head, recently had their Slack accounts deactivated, Business Insider reported earlier this week.

In the days that followed, workers were pulled into one-on-ones to review their responsibilities, projects, and achievements, nine workers told Business Insider. They were asked if there were any coworkers they wanted to highlight for their hard work, the workers said.

XAI told workers on Thursday night to prepare for a reorganization of the data annotation team.

In a team-wide announcement on Thursday night, the company asked some workers to drop everything and focus on a series of tests to determine their roles at the company going forward, asking staff to complete them by Friday morning West Coast time. The tests would be used to sort annotators and their supervisors based on their strengths and interests, according to a screenshot viewed by Business Insider.

The notice for tutors to prepare for testing was posted by Diego Pasini, who ten workers said recently became the team's leader. Pasini asked workers to take at least one test by the following morning. The tests covered traditional domains like STEM, coding, finance, and medicine, as well as quirkier specialties like Grok's "personality and model behavior" and "shitposters and doomscrollers."

The company also listed tests for workers aiming to improve the chatbot's safety, including by "red teaming" the bot, as well as tests dedicated to audio and video content.

Pasini joined xAI in January, according to his LinkedIn profile. He is "on leave" from his undergraduate studies at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, his LinkedIn shows.

Pasini and a representative for xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The announcement said the tests were aimed at supervisors and generalist tutors. XAI divides its teams between STEM, coding, finance, legal, and media specialties, as well as a large pool of generalist tutors who are tasked with a wide range of assignments, from annotating video and audio to writing.

Two workers said the STEM and coding tests took place on CodeSignal, a skills assessment platform, while other tests were hosted on Google Forms.

More than 200 workers responded to Pasini's message with a green check-mark emoji, and over 100 replied to the post with questions and comments, according to a screenshot viewed by Business Insider.

One worker expressed frustration with the short time span that was given for the tests, according to a screenshot viewed by Business Insider.

"Doing this after people have gone home for the day is pretty shady," the worker wrote. The worker's Slack account was deactivated shortly after, multiple workers said.Update: September 13, 2025 — This story has been updated to include a statement from xAI.

Keith Rabois, cofounder and new chairman at Opendoor Technologies, says the company is so "bloated" it could cut the vast majority of its workforce.

Rabois, whose return to the company's board of directors was announced Thursday, outlined several changes that are needed at Opendoor in an interview with CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Friday.

"There's 1,400 employees at Opendoor. I don't know what most of them do. We don't need more than 200 of them," Rabois said, adding, "the company is completely bloated."

Opendoor, which buys and sells homes, is currently making waves as the latest meme stock beloved by retail traders. The stock got another boost on Thursday when the company announced cofounders Rabois and Eric Wu were rejoining the board and that Kaz Nejatian, COO of Shopify, was appointed CEO. At market close on Friday, the stock was up 470% year-to-date.

Rabois, who is also managing director at the VC firm Khosla Ventures, told CNBC Opendoor's culture was "broken," citing remote work and diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.

"These people were working remotely. That doesn't work," he said, adding that the company also went down a "DEI path."

"We're going to fix all that. We're back to merit and excellence," Rabois said.

Opendoor did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Rabois's comments are part of a larger trend of tech leaders lamenting remote work and rolling out return-to-office mandates, which business leaders have also noted as a way to reduce headcounts without layoffs.

Several prominent tech companies have also rolled back DEI efforts, including Amazon, Google, and Meta.

At Tesla, a long list of extracurriculars seems to pay off.

Tesla's chair, Robyn Denholm, appeared on "Bloomberg Talks" on Friday to discuss the new $1 trillion compensation package its board crafted for CEO Elon Musk. The package is meant to motivate Musk to help Tesla hit 12 ambitious "operational milestones," including taking Tesla's valuation to $8.5 trillion, selling about 12 million cars in the next decade, and putting a million robotaxis on the road.

Beyond the money, though, Denholm said that Musk's involvement in other ventures motivates him to deliver for Tesla.

"Actually, having his creative energies in various endeavours that are outside of Tesla actually helps Tesla. I know that sounds perverse, and people don't really understand that," Denholm said. "But having worked with him now for 11 years, it actually benefits Tesla with him doing things that are not in the mission of Tesla outside of Tesla, both from a resource perspective, but also from a motivation perspective."

Outside Tesla, Musk's endeavors include serving as CEO of aerospace company SpaceX, the CEO of brain-computer interface company Neuralink, the CEO of Grok maker xAI, and playing a major part in running X, alongside managing a nonprofit dedicated to renewable energy called the Musk Foundation.

What's been less appealing to Tesla's board, however, is Musk's involvement in politics. In a proxy statement filed with the SEC, Tesla's board said it sought "assurances that Musk's involvement with the political sphere would wind down in a timely manner."

Denholm added that Musk has the same right to be political as any private citizen, but his days in the administration are behind him.

"And so from a politics perspective, obviously, we're in a democracy, so everybody gets to voice their points of view. I think Elon, having served as a special government employee, he obviously completed that activity, and he is back and front and center at the company these days," she said. "What he does from a personal perspective in terms of his political motivations, et cetera, is up to him."

Denholm's stance is more tepid than some of the company's more outspoken investors and observers — many of whom say Musk needs to rein in his focus or leave.

Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, known as one of Tesla's most bullish observers on Wall Street, said on X in July that Tesla's board of directors needs to establish some "ground rules" for Musk after he said he would launch a new political party called the America Party. Ross Gerber, an early Tesla backer, said in April that Musk had gone too far — another executive would be better to helm the company.

"With Tesla, it's simple. It's you get another face of Tesla. It could be anybody, any CEO, somebody who's in the middle, who is a great communicator, who refocuses people on what Tesla really does," Gerber said, adding that the company needed to take measures to reorient its identity around things other than Musk. "I've been saying this for two years. Tesla needs to be Tesla."

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Fabian Dori, the chief investment officer at digital asset bank Sygnum, says that banks offering crypto-backed loans prefer crypto collateral in the form of onchain assets rather than exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and using onchain collateral can benefit borrowers.

Dori said that onchain assets are more liquid, allowing lenders to execute margin calls for crypto-backed loans on demand and offer higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios to borrowers because the lender can liquidate the collateral in real-time. Dori told Cointelegraph:

Loan-to-value ratios in crypto refer to the total amount of a loan versus the collateral backing the loan, like Bitcoin BTCUSD, Ethereum ETHUSD, or any other tokens accepted by the lender. 

A higher LTV ratio means the borrower is able to access more credit in relation to their posted crypto collateral, while a lower LTV means they will get a smaller loan for the same amount of collateral.

Crypto-backed loans are still in their infancy, Dori said, but he was confident that the sector would continue to grow as crypto gains widespread adoption. 

Financial institutions are steadily embracing loans secured by crypto as crypto lenders go public on US stock exchanges, and traditional financial (TradFi) firms warm up to the idea of accepting crypto as loan collateral. 

Crypto lending debuts on Wall Street as TradFi warms up to crypto-backed lending 

Figure Technology, a crypto-backed lending company, made its debut on the Nasdaq exchange, a tech-focused US stock exchange, on Thursday.

Shares of the company surged by over 24% during intraday trading on the first day, and the company currently has a market capitalization of over $6.8 billion, according to Yahoo Finance.

Financial services company JP Morgan is also considering offering crypto-backed loans to clients, a development that would take place sometime in 2026 if the legacy financial giant moves forward with the idea.

OpenSea has quietly doubled its trading fees just days before launching its long-awaited SEA token. The platform will now charge 1% on NFT trades, up from 0.5%, marking a 100% increase. The adjustment, announced by Chief Marketing Officer Adam Hollander in a lengthy update on X, takes effect September 15.

According to the update, half of the new trading fees and 0.85% token swap fees will support OpenSea's pre-token rewards program. This pool already holds $1 million in Optimism's OP and Arbitrum's ARB tokens, along with high-value NFTs. Rewards will be distributed through a gamified system of treasure chests, designed to keep traders engaged before the SEA token launch.

Significantly, the company has not committed to lowering fees once the rewards campaign ends. Such uncertainty can be disinhibiting to traders, particularly with competing platforms such as Blur, Magic Eden, and LooksRare still charging zero or less. By driving up the prices, OpenSea stands to lose its market share to competitors that are aggressively attracting users with lower trading fees.

The fee increase was announced alongside several new initiatives. OpenSea introduced a mobile application it calls “AI-native.” The app integrates user portfolios across multiple chains. It also provides real-time trading suggestions. The company launched its Flagship Collection with over $1 million allocated to acquiring historic NFTs like CryptoPunks.

These actions show that OpenSea wants to be more than just a marketplace. It also aims to act as a curator and trading assistant. With AI, unique collections, and token rewards, the company is set to stay relevant in a highly competitive world.

The SEA token, expected in early October, is being promoted as more than just another marketplace currency. OpenSea's foundation has hinted at sustainable mechanics and strong reasons for long-term holding. If designed effectively, the token could attract investors and provide new liquidity for the platform.

Gemini Space Station, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, surged in its Nasdaq debut Friday after raising $425 million in an initial public offering.

The company priced its IPO late Thursday at $28 a share, valuing Gemini at about $3.3 billion before trading began. That price was above the revised $24 to $26 range it set earlier in the week and well above the initial $17 to $19 range. The offering covered 15.2 million shares.

On Friday, the stock opened at $37.01, a 32% premium to the offer price. Shares climbed as high as $45.89 during intraday trading before settling at $32, still 14% above the IPO level by the close.

Gemini, headquartered in New York, operates a suite of crypto services including a spot exchange, custody solutions for institutions, a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, a crypto rewards credit card, and staking products. As of the end of July, the company held more than $21 billion of assets on its platform. Filings show Gemini lost $159 million in 2024 and $283 million in the first half of 2025.

The Winklevoss brothers, who became the first bitcoin billionaires after early investments in the cryptocurrency, appeared on CNBC's "Squawk Box" on the morning of the IPO. Tyler Winklevoss described bitcoin as “gold 2.0” and said adoption remains in the “first inning.” He and his brother projected that bitcoin could reach $1 million within the next decade.

Gemini's listing follows those of Coinbase (COIN) in April 2021 and Bullish (BLSH), which owns CoinDesk, last month.

Bitcoin BTC$115,573.69 is about 4% higher than it was a week ago—good news for the digital asset but bad news for the economy. 

The recent negative tone of the economic data points from last week raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates on Wednesday, making riskier assets such as stocks and bitcoin more attractive.

Let's recap the data that backs up that thesis. 

The most important one, the U.S. CPI figures, came out on Thursday. The headline rate was slightly higher than expected, a sign inflation might be stickier than anticipated. 

Before that, we had Tuesday's revisions to job data. The world's largest economy created almost 1 million fewer jobs than reported in the year ended March, the largest downward revision in the country's history.

The figures followed the much-watched monthly jobs report, which was released the previous Friday. The U.S. added just 22,000 jobs in August, with unemployment rising to 4.3%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Initial jobless claims rose 27,000 to 263,000 — the highest since October 2021.

Higher inflation and fewer jobs are not great for the U.S. economy, so it's no surprise that the word "stagflation" is starting to creep back into macroeconomic commentary.

Against this backdrop, bitcoin—considered a risk asset by Wall Street—continued grinding higher, topping $116,000 on Friday and almost closing the CME futures gap at 117,300 from August. 

Not a surprise, as traders are also bidding up the biggest risk assets: equities. Just take a look at the S&P 500 index, which closed at a record for the second day on the hope of a rate cut. 

So how should traders think about BTC's price chart? 

To this chart enthusiast, price action remains constructive, with higher lows forming from the September bottom of $107,500. The 200-day moving average has climbed to $102,083, while the Short-Term Holder Realized Price — often used as support in bull markets — rose to a record $109,668.

However, bitcoin's weekly positive price action didn't help Strategy (MSTR), the largest of the bitcoin treasury companies, whose shares were about flat for the week. Its rivals performed better: MARA Holdings (MARA) 7% and XXI (CEP) 4%.

Strategy (MSTR) has underperformed bitcoin year-to-date and continues to hover below its 200-day moving average, currently $355. At Thursday's close of $326, it's testing a key long-term support level seen back in September 2024 and April 2025. 

The company's mNAV premium has compressed to below 1.5x when accounting for outstanding convertible debt and preferred stock, or roughly 1.3x based solely on equity value.

Preferred stock issuance remains muted, with only $17 million tapped across STRK and STRF this week, meaning that the bulk of at-the-money issuance is still flowing through common shares. According to the company, options are now listed and trading for all four perpetual preferred stocks, a development that could provide additional yield on the dividend.

The CME's FedWatch tool shows traders expect a 25 basis-point U.S. interest-rate cut in September and have priced in a total of three rate cuts by year-end. 

That's a sign risk sentiment could tilt back toward growth and crypto-linked equities, underlined by the 10-year U.S. Treasury briefly breaking below 4% this week.

Still, the dollar index (DXY) continues to hold multiyear support, a potential inflection point worth watching.

DOGE is having its day (again), with Dogecoin putting up enormous gains on the week amid growing corporate and institutional interest in the O.G. meme coin.

Dogecoin has surged by nearly 13% over the last day alone, topping the $0.30 mark on Saturday morning for the first time since the start of February. At a current price of $0.299, DOGE has pumped by about 40% over the last week.

Other major coins have had strong weeks, as well, with Solana up 18% during that span and XRP putting up a nearly 12% jump. But Dogecoin remains the top dog among the 10 most valuable cryptocurrencies by market cap.

It's also crushing recent gains by Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are up 4.5% and about 9% over the last week, respectively.

Dogecoin is finally getting some institutional attention after analysts told Decrypt that the lack of it was contributing to Dogecoin remaining well below its all-time high mark from 2021, while other major coins hit recent highs.

Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, DOGE hasn't had big companies loading up on it or ETFs driving investor demand. But that's changing fast.

This week, publicly traded CleanCore Solutions—which trades as ZONE on the NYSE American—started amassing sizable amounts of Dogecoin, buying over 500 million DOGE now worth about $148 million. The firm is working with House of Doge, the commercial side of the Dogecoin Foundation, and calling itself an "official" DOGE treasury company.

CleanCore's CIO Marco Margiotta said in a statement this week that it wants to make Dogecoin a serious reserve asset while expanding its use for payments and other financial services. It's an ambitious vision for what started as a joke cryptocurrency.

Update Part 3: Another delay. Launching next week. Mid week. Prob Thur. https://t.co/Lzk2pCVo0E

— Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 11, 2025



There's also buzz around the first U.S. spot Dogecoin ETF from Rex-Osprey (ticker: DOJE), which will let regular investors buy into DOGE through their traditional brokers. It's been delayed multiple times now, with trading originally set to begin on Thursday, then Friday, and now expected to be sometime next week per Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas.

But the delays haven't slowed Dogecoin's momentum in recent days, given the continued surge.

Pi Network has successfully upgraded its blockchain protocol to version 20 on its testnet, causing a 3% increase in the value of Pi Coin. This marks a critical step in the platform's long-term development, with more updates expected as the network moves towards version 23. As interest grows, the upgrade also highlights the increasing potential for Pi's future in the cryptocurrency market.

Pi Network has transitioned from version 19 to version 20 of its blockchain protocol. This upgrade is part of a series of incremental changes planned for the network, with the goal of strengthening its blockchain architecture in preparation for future Mainnet activities. Pi Network, which has millions of users worldwide, is gradually progressing with its upgrades, creating anticipation within the community.

The update to version 20 is currently live on the testnet, signaling a step forward for the network's technical development. Dr. Altcoin, a Pi Network advocate, confirmed the change via social media, noting that this is an important milestone for Pi's journey. Pi Network's blockchain updates typically lead to heightened interest and engagement from both the community and investors, which is reflected in the positive price movement of Pi Coin.

Following the protocol upgrade, Pi Coin has seen a modest increase in value. The coin's price rose by 3% to $0.3537, up from the previous close of $0.3452. While this is a short-term gain, it illustrates the market's response to the upgrade and renewed investor interest. Over the past week, Pi Coin has shown a slight increase, although its performance over the last month and six months remains mixed.

Pi Coin's price has faced significant volatility, with a decrease of nearly 10% in the last 30 days and a 75.65% drop over the past six months. However, its cumulative growth since launch is still substantial, with gains exceeding 250%. The price increase following the version 20 upgrade indicates that some market participants are optimistic about Pi's future progress.

In addition to the blockchain upgrade, Pi Network is hosting a domain name auction, which runs until September 30. This auction allows Pi users to bid on domain names tied to the Pi ecosystem, further expanding its utility. This move is intended to encourage the creation of digital identities and services on Pi-powered domains, which can add value to the overall ecosystem.

The domain auction represents a significant development in Pi Network's strategy to foster a broader use case for its blockchain. By allowing users to secure domain names, Pi Network is enhancing the possibilities for businesses and individuals to build on its platform. The auction also offers an opportunity for Pi pioneers to establish a digital presence within the growing ecosystem.

As Pi Network continues to grow and evolve, these upgrades and initiatives contribute to its ambition of becoming a more established and versatile blockchain in the digital space.

A coalition of leading associations in the finance, tech, and digital sectors has written a letter to the UK government, urging it to include Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) as a core strand of the UK-US Tech Bridge.

The US-UK Tech Bridge is a bilateral agreement between the two nations to collaborate and share resources on emerging innovations, technology, and digital policy.

With Trump set to visit the UK from September 17-19, this letter comes at a crucial time as Britain looks to assert its dominance in the digital finance sector.

Read on as we uncover what the letter proposes and highlight the best altcoins we think could benefit from growing government crypto adoption.

The signatories believe that DLT is a major driving force for the development of next-generation infrastructure and financial services, facilitating cheaper and faster payments, improving capital flows, and driving efficiencies and productivity.

The letter highlights two key sectors of DLT that the UK government must pay close attention to: tokenization and stablecoins.



The coalition stresses that this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create the world's first transatlantic framework for DLT, with both the US and UK being major global economies of strategic importance.

While the UK handles nearly 40% of global FX turnover, the US is home to the world's largest capital pool and the epicenter of digital asset innovation.

Amid growing competitive pressure, the letter recommends forming a joint sandbox with political backing to seize the opportunities of new technology and cement Britain's role as the world's leading hub for digital finance innovation.

As the world's top financial powerhouses pivot toward digital assets such as tokenized securities and stablecoins, it's inevitable that the next few decades of global finance will be dominated by cryptocurrencies and the broader digital finance ecosystem.

This is why forward-looking investors are actively identifying promising cryptocurrencies. If you want to make the most of this global shift, here are some of the top cryptos you should add to your portfolio right now.

There's no doubt that Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency in the world, with a market cap of $2.31T. However, it still struggles with slow speeds and can only process 7 transactions per second since it handles them one by one.

Enter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), the first-ever Layer 2 solution built on the Bitcoin blockchain.

$HYPER, with its Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, enables parallel transaction processing, where multiple transactions can be processed simultaneously as long as they're not related to each other.

This drastically increases throughput and speed while reducing transaction costs.

The SVM integration also allows developers to execute smart contracts and build dApps directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, opening the doors to Web3 and DeFi participation.



At the core of this utility is a non-custodial, decentralized canonical bridge that locks up your L1 Bitcoin tokens to mint an equivalent amount of L2-compatible Bitcoin.

This utility-driven approach has made the $HYPER presale a huge success, raising $15.5M so far. Each token is currently priced at just $0.012905.

According to our $HYPER price prediction, the token could hit $0.32 in 2025, offering a massive 2,300% return from current levels.

If you're wondering how to become part of this journey, here's a step-by-step guide on how to buy $HYPER.

SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) powers a revolutionary content creation platform that aims to transform the $85B content creation industry.

Right now, creators have to give up as much as 70% of their revenue in platform fees. Plus, there's always the lingering threat of arbitrary bans and account suspensions.

Enter SUBBD, which charges only a fraction of creator revenue as fees while also offering a host of AI tools.

For instance, it provides AI text generators, AI photo and video tools for striking visuals, and AI audio generators to help creators build engaging content without wasting time.

This allows creators to focus more on engaging with their audience and forming loyal fan bases through direct interaction.



Holding $SUBBD also comes with a range of benefits. You can use it to unlock exclusive content, request custom creations, and tip your favorite creators.

One of the standout features of SUBBD is its flat 20% staking return for the first year, giving you assured passive income.

What's more, staking also unlocks added perks, such as exclusive behind-the-scenes content and creator livestreams.

The $SUBBD presale has already raised $1.13M. Each token is currently priced at $0.056425, and as per our $SUBBD price prediction, it could hit $0.301 by the end of 2025 – a 400% return in just a few months.

Here's our detailed guide on how to buy $SUBBD before the next price increase.

Visit SUBBD Token's official website to learn more about how it's blending crypto, AI, and content.

MemeCore ($M) is a Layer 1 ‘meme chain' that aims to transform the best meme coins from hype-driven digital currencies into culturally relevant, utility-rich assets through governance, on-chain activity, and virality.

MemeCore rewards every form of participation – whether it's trading, staking, creating, or validating on the blockchain – since it believes each contribution is critical to strengthening the network's growth.

The project's goal is to build a participatory economy where every action is measured, verified, and rewarded. This creates a value-generating ecosystem that's sustainable in the long run.



$M has surged more than 250% since the start of September and around 37% in the last seven days.

It crossed the $1 landmark for the first time on September 4 and is now trading at around $2.37, with strong support at $1.80.

With a market cap of $2.46B, MemeCore is now among the top 50 cryptocurrencies in the world. As interest in $M continues to grow, the token could set fresh all-time highs in the coming weeks.

Donald Trump's war of words against the Federal Reserve and its chair Jerome Powell have shocked bitcoin, crypto and stock markets this year (with Trump now armed with a surprise, secret weapon).

The bitcoin price has surged alongside gold to an all-time high last month, pushing the combined crypto market to over $4 trillion as the crypto “floodgates are starting to open.”

Now, as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk issues a stark, $37 trillion warning, a close ally of Trump has predicted the president will “take the Fed over,” something that could up-end the global financial order and cause chaos for the bitcoin price, crypto and stock markets.

“Trump was furious at Powell in the first term for jacking up [interest] rates for no particular reason,” Larry Kudlow, a close ally of Trump who was a top adviser in the White House during the president's first term, told the New York Post.

“It's sort of a sad tale. If it weren't such serious business, it reads comedically to some extent; people yelling at each other. But look, the bottom line is: President Trump's going to take the Fed over, as he should.”

The row between Trump and the Fed has been brewing for years, with accusations of political bias beginning when Powell incorrectly called post-Covid lockdown inflation “transitory,” holding back from increasing interest rates in response to rising prices.

The battle was turbo-charged when Powell surprised markets with a 50 basis point inflation hike in September last year, seen by some as a gift to Trump's Democratic Party election rival Kamala Harris.

Earlier this year, Trump raised the possibility he could remove Powell before his term is up next year, spooking markets that fear the end of Federal Reserve political independence. However, the odds on Trump "removing" Powell on the crypto-powered Polymarket prediction platform have dropped to around 5% from a peak of 20% in July.

Since then, Trump has tried to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook and installed Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) and a bitcoin supporter, as a temporary Fed governor.

“What investors appear to be overlooking is president Trump's continued meddling in the [Fed's] affairs, thereby threatening its independence. This could end up being a far more serious issue," David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments.

This week, the Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates, responding to a slowing labor market that's outweighed the risk of inflationary price pressures.

Many of the most bullish bitcoin traders and investors have predicted the bitcoin price will climb at a faster rate when the Fed does begin to lower interest rates, something that encourages cash to flow more quickly through the economy.

The bitcoin price and wider crypto market has surged over the last week, with bitcoin climbing 5% as traders feel emboldened by what's expected to be a dovish Fed pivot.

A crypto wallet linked to an infamous Coinbase hacker has bought another 3,976 Ether, worth over $18.9 million, at $4,756 per token, according to onchain data.

The purchase was made on Saturday, using 18.911 million DAI (DAI), according to data from Arkham Intelligence. The hacker consolidated various DAI amounts, ranging from $80,000 to $6 million, before executing multiple ETH buys. 

The Coinbase hacker wallet has been under surveillance by blockchain analysts since earlier this year. It's reportedly tied to a $300 million+ social engineering scam that targeted Coinbase users. 

In May, onchain sleuth and security analyst ZachXBT estimated that the campaign defrauded victims out of at least $330 million. “Our number is likely much lower than the actual amount stolen as our data was limited to my DMs and thefts we discovered onchain,” he said at the time.

The latest Ether accumulation follows a series of significant trades from the same address. Last month, the wallet acquired $8 million worth of Solana (SOL) across several purchases, which has since slipped below the entry price. 

Prior to that, in July, the same wallet scooped up 4,863 ETH ($12.55 million) and 649 ETH ($2.3 million) at around $3,562 per token.

Meanwhile, the latest Ether purchase comes as the price of ETH rose above $4,700 on Saturday to hit a local high of around $4,763, its highest level in more than two weeks. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $4,718, up by 4.5% over the past day.

A crypto trader on Hyperliquid transformed a $125,000 deposit into a $303 million leveraged long on Ether, achieving a peak equity of $43 million before exiting with $6.86 million in realized profit. The position was built over four months through continuous compounding and high leverage.

The trader's approach, which was recycling all gains into a single position, was backed by favorable price action and timing. As the ETH market showed signs of cooling, the trader unwound the 66,749 ETH long just before the reversal, preserving a 55x return on the original stake.

 The Uruguay Central Bank is researching digital currency plans, which is an indication of a change in the financial environment of the country with far-reaching consequences.

The Central Bank of Uruguay officially started researching the use of a digital currency. This is in line with a world trend of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). 

This research is in light of knowing how this new money could be fitted within the economy of Uruguay. To spearhead this drive, the Central Bank has put in place a former senior-level manager who has experience in financial systems. 

This executive will examine the technical infrastructure, regulatory environment, and possible economic effects of a digital currency. The primary source of information comes in the form of El Paais Uruguay, which covered the development in very detail.

This research is a big milestone in the financial industry in Uruguay. It is an indication of a grave desire to modernize payments and money management. 

Digital currencies are able to provide cheaper and quicker transactions. They can also enhance the availability of banking services to the unbanked population.

The Central Bank is interested in estimating the monetary policy impacts. Authorities are also concerned with the threat of security attacks, privacy matters, and financial sustainability. Uruguay will need proper protection in the event it chooses to proceed.


The launch of an electronic money currency has the potential to change the way Uruguayans deal with money. 

It can ease the process of payment and lessen the use of cash. There are various digital currency models, ranging from full replacements to cash complements.

It is focused on financial inclusion. A large number of citizens do not have formal access to banking. 

Digital currency may introduce these people into the formal fiscal framework. This would enable easy saving and dealing in transactions.

The Central Bank of Uruguay does not want to make premature decisions. They intend to study all the attempts at the CBDC globally to understand the best practices and pitfalls to avoid.

The position of the manager appointed plays a decisive role. He or she will make sure that it is a balanced solution, considering both positive and possible difficulties.


The Uruguay exploration project is an indication that the country is open to financial innovation without compromising on conventional stability. 

Uruguay does not want to lag behind as countries around the world are trying digital money. A proper system would be obviously planned and would provide transparency, traceability, and efficiency. It can also help in economic growth through better payment facilities. 

The Central Bank will consult with the stakeholders, i.e., banks, businesses, and the people.

This initiative puts Uruguay at the top of Latin American leaders in terms of the implementation of digital currency. The findings of the research will inform subsequent policy-making. It will be announced formally after the analysis is done

U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins said crypto's time has come, pledging to modernize the U.S. securities rulebook and expand “Project Crypto” to bring markets on-chain.

Speaking in Paris on Sept. 10 at the OECD's inaugural Roundtable on Global Financial Markets, Atkins said the SEC is shifting away from enforcement-driven policymaking and will provide clear rules for tokens, custody, and trading platforms. “Policy will no longer be set by ad hoc enforcement actions,” he said, calling the new approach “a golden age of financial innovation on U.S. soil.”

Atkins said most tokens are not securities and promised bright-line rules for determining when crypto assets fall under SEC oversight. He said entrepreneurs must be able to raise capital on-chain without “endless legal uncertainty” and pledged a framework for platforms that integrate trading, lending, and staking under one license. Custody rules will also be updated to allow investors and intermediaries multiple options.

The SEC chair said Project Crypto would clear the way for tokenized securities, new on-chain asset classes, and decentralized finance software, while ensuring investor protections. He also highlighted the potential for “super-app” trading platforms and stressed the importance of keeping innovation in the United States.

Atkins first unveiled Project Crypto on July 31, 2025, in Washington, framing it as the SEC's “north star” in supporting President Trump's goal of making the U.S. the world's crypto hub. His Paris remarks expanded on that agenda, outlining more details on custody, capital formation, and platform rules.

Atkins' remarks came two days after Nasdaq President Tal Cohen posted on LinkedIn that tokenization is an “extraordinary opportunity” for global markets. Cohen said Nasdaq had filed with the SEC to enable trading of tokenized securities, underscoring how major institutions are moving toward blockchain adoption.

Beyond crypto, Atkins addressed foreign company listings, accounting standards, and European regulation. He raised concerns over “double materiality” in EU reporting laws, urged stable funding for the IASB, and said the SEC may revisit its 2007 decision to allow IFRS without reconciliation to U.S. GAAP if funding issues persist.

The SEC chair also highlighted artificial intelligence as a force that could fundamentally reshape financial markets. He described a shift toward “agentic finance,” where autonomous AI systems could execute trades, allocate capital, and manage risk at speeds no human can match, with compliance embedded directly into their code. 

Such systems, he said, could deliver faster and cheaper markets while opening advanced strategies to a broader set of investors. Coupled with blockchain infrastructure, these tools could empower individuals, increase competition, and unlock new growth. 

Atkins cautioned, however, that regulators must provide “commonsense guardrails” without overreacting out of fear. He argued that on-chain capital markets and AI-driven finance are on the horizon, and that America must choose leadership to ensure the next generation of financial innovation takes root at home.

Atkins concluded by saying regulators must strike a balance between innovation and investor protection. “Crypto's time has come,” he said, adding that U.S. markets should lead the next wave of financial innovation rather than watching it unfold overseas.

 Spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $642 million and Ether ETFs added $405 million on Friday amid renewed institutional demand. 

Spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs are seeing renewed inflows as institutional appetite for crypto exposure continues to build. 

On Friday, spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs recorded $642.35 million in net inflows, marking the fifth straight day of gains, according to data from SoSoValue. This pushed cumulative net inflows to $56.83 billion, with total net assets now standing at $153.18 billion, roughly 6.62% of Bitcoin's total market cap.

Fidelity's FBTC led the day with $315.18 million in fresh capital, while BlackRock's IBIT followed with $264.71 million. Trading volumes across all spot Bitcoin ETFs topped $3.89 billion, signaling robust activity and growing institutional positioning. Market leaders like IBIT and FBTC posted daily gains of over 2%.

The uptick comes after a quieter start to the month, suggesting a shift in sentiment as macroeconomic conditions stabilize and the crypto market shows signs of strength. In total, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw $2.34 billion in cumulative net inflows over the past five days.

Spot Ether (ETH) ETFs mirrored the bullish momentum, pulling in $405.55 million in daily net inflows on the same day, their fourth consecutive day of gains. Total Ether ETF inflows have now reached $13.36 billion, with net assets at $30.35 billion.

On Friday, BlackRock's ETHA brought in $165.56 million, while Fidelity's FETH was close behind at $168.23 million. ETHA alone saw $1.86 billion in value traded on the day, reflecting rising activity in Ethereum-based products.

“Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs keep seeing strong inflows, showing rising institutional confidence,” Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph. 

“If macro conditions hold, this surge could strengthen liquidity and drive momentum for both assets,” Liu added.

BlackRock is reportedly exploring the tokenization of ETFs on blockchain networks, following the success of its spot Bitcoin ETFs. The asset management giant is particularly interested in tokenizing funds tied to real-world assets (RWA), though regulatory challenges remain a key hurdle.

Tokenized ETFs could offer new functionality such as 24/7 trading and integration into decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems.

 Arthur Hayes says that Bitcoiners buying Bitcoin one day and expecting a Lamborghini the next is “not the right way to think about things.” 

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes says Bitcoin holders need to be more patient and stop worrying about stocks and gold hitting record highs, because asking why Bitcoin isn't higher misses the point.

“If you thought you were buying Bitcoin and the next day you were buying a Lamborghini, you're probably getting liquidated because it is not the right way to think about things,” Hayes told Kyle Chasse in an interview published to YouTube on Friday.

“I'm sorry that you bought Bitcoin six months ago, but anyone who bought it two, three, five, or 10 years ago, they're laughing,” Hayes said, echoing the frustrations of recent Bitcoin (BTC) buyers who are asking why Bitcoin's price isn't trading at $150,000 yet. 

“People need to readjust their perspective on this,” he said. Curvo data shows that Bitcoin has seen an average annualized return of 82.4% over the past ten years.

It comes as Bitcoin continues to trade below its all-time high of $124,100 reached on Aug. 14, currently sitting at $115,890 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap. 

Meanwhile, this week, gold reached a new all-time high of $3,674, and the S&P 500 set a record closing high of 6,587.

Hayes dismissed the significance of these highs relative to Bitcoin and pushed back on a question from Chasse, about when Bitcoin and the broader crypto market might start attracting more flows from the global M2 money supply, given that stocks and gold reached new all-time highs.

“I think the premise of that question is flawed,” Hayes said. “Bitcoin is the best performing asset when you think about currency debasement ever,” Hayes said.

Hayes said while the S&P 500 is “up in dollar terms,” it has still not recovered from 2008 when compared against the gold price. “Deflate the housing market by gold again and not anywhere close to where it was,” he added.

“Big US tech is probably one of the only things that have done well deflated by gold,” he said.

“If you deflate things by Bitcoin, you can't even see it on the chart; it is just so ridiculous about how well Bitcoin has performed,” he said.

In April 2025, Hayes projected that Bitcoin would reach $250,000 by the end of this year, and just a month later, in May, Unchained Market Research Director Joe Burnett made the same prediction.

One of the ways that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) earn their "forever chemical" nickname and persist in the environment is their acidity.

Many of these toxic chemicals are highly acidic, meaning they easily give up their protons and become negatively charged. This allows them to dissolve and spread in water more easily.

Now, new research has found that some PFAS are even more acidic than previously thought -- an insight critical for predicting their mobility in the environment and potential impacts on human health.

It comes from a University at Buffalo-led team that introduced a new and rigorous experimental method to determine the acidity of 10 types of PFAS and three of their common breakdown products.

Published last month in Environmental Science & Technology Letters, their measurements of these chemicals' acid dissociation constant, or pKa, were mostly lower, in some cases dramatically, than those reported in experimental studies and predicted by computational chemistry models. In one case, the pKa of GenX, a replacement for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in the manufacturing of Teflon, was found to be about one thousand times lower than the measurement listed in a previous study.

The lower the pKa, the more likely a chemical is to give up a proton and exist in its charged form.

"These findings suggest that previous measurements have underestimated PFAS' acidity. This means their ability to persist and spread in the environment has been mischaracterized, too," says the study's corresponding author, Alexander Hoepker, PhD, a senior research scientist with the UB RENEW Institute.

More accurate pKa measurements help efforts to understand the behavior of PFAS in the environment. A chemical's pKa could mean the difference as to whether it remains dissolved in water, sticks to soil or a biological membrane or perhaps volatilizes into the air.

"If we're going to understand how these concerning chemicals spread, it's very important we have a reliable method for the accurate determination of their pKa values," says Diana Aga, PhD, director of RENEW and SUNY Distinguished Professor and Henry M. Woodburn Chair in the UB Department of Chemistry.

The work was supported by the National Science Foundation and done in collaboration with Scott Simpson, PhD, professor and chair of the St. Bonaventure Department of Chemistry, and researchers from Spain's Institute of Environmental Assessment and Water Research.

Combining experiments with computations

PFAS are made of a highly fluorinated, water-repelling tail and a more water-loving headgroup. Many of the most scrutinized PFAS have a highly acidic headgroup, making them more likely to give up a proton and exist in its charged form.

Whether a PFAS exists in its neutral or charged form depends on the pH level of their surrounding environment. That's where pKa comes in. It tells scientists the pH level at which a given PFAS is equal to flip from neutral to charged, or vice versa.

But there has been much disagreement about the pKa measurements of some PFAS, like PFOA, with different teams coming up with widely different values. One of the reasons for this may be the glass used during their experiments.

"PFAS likes to stick to glass. When that happens, it throws off traditional, so-called bulk measurements that quantify how much PFAS is in a solution," Hoepker says. "In other cases, too much organic solvent is used to get PFAS into solution, which similarly biases the pKa measurement."

To address this challenge, the UB team used fluorine and proton (hydrogen) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy -- think MRI for molecules. NMR places a sample in a strong magnetic field and probes its atomic nuclei with radio waves.

When a PFAS headgroup is negatively charged, nearby fluorine atoms respond at a different (radio) frequency.

Reading these atom-level signatures lets the researchers tell whether a PFAS molecule is charged or neutral -- capabilities that other methods that have been used previously cannot provide.

"This unique measurement allows NMR to inherently account for PFAS losses to glass or other adsorption behaviors, so your pKa measurements don't end up way off the mark," Hoepker says.

Some PFAS are so acidic (pKa of less than zero) that generating them in their neutral form would require super-acidic conditions (a pH level of less than zero) that are impractical in standard labs. In those cases, the research team paired NMR experiments with electronic-structure calculations using density functional theory to predict the NMR shifts of the neutral and ionized forms.

"We augmented partial NMR datasets with computational predictions to arrive at more accurate pKa values," Hoepker says. "This NMR-centered hybrid approach -- integrating experimental measurements with computational analyses -- enhanced our confidence in the results and, to our knowledge, has not previously been applied to PFAS acidity."

Problem PFAS measured more accurately 

The PFAS that has been the most difficult to measure is PFOA, once commonly used in nonstick pans and deemed hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency last year.

The team found its pKa to be -0.27, meaning it will be negatively charged at practically any realistic pH level. Previous experimental studies had measured its pKa as high as 3.8 and more commonly around 1, while the computational methods COSMO-RS and OPERA had determined its pKa at 0.24 and 0.34, respectively.

Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) -- an emerging PFAS increasingly detected in waters worldwide and likely transported through the atmosphere and deposited by rain -- was found to be far more acidic than previously reported, with a pKa of around 0.03. Earlier estimates had anywhere from 0.30 to 1.1.

Notably, the team determined the pKa values for several prominent emerging PFAS that had never been measured, such as 5:3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (5:3 FTCA), and PFAS ethers like NFDHA and PFMPA that are newer PFAS but are also likely to pose challenges for regulators due to their health effects.

"This new experimental approach of determining pKa values for PFAS will have wide-ranging applications, from being able to validate computationally derived values, to facilitating the development of machine learning models that can better predict pKa values of newly discovered PFAS contaminants when reference standards are not available," Aga says. "In turn, knowledge of the pKa values of emerging PFAS will allow researchers to develop appropriate analytical methods, remediation technologies, and risk assessment strategies more efficiently."

Aside from Simpson, other co-authors include Silvia Lacorte, a senior scientist with the Spanish Institute of Environmental Assessment and Water Research; Aina Queral Beltran, a University of Barcelona PhD student and former visiting student at UB; and UB Chemistry graduate students Damalka Balasuriya and Tristan Vick.

New research suggests that you should embrace the dark.

Here's what you'll learn in this story:

Evil. Death. Danger. For centuries, the dark has carried slander: sinister figures, black cats slipping across the path, ghost stories, and hellscapes. But it wasn't always so. For most of history, the unseen darkness was part of ordinary life. For example, families in medieval Europe slept in two acts—a “first sleep,” then a waking hour to pray, make love, or wander to a neighbor's hearth before sinking into “second sleep.” After all, we evolved near the equator, in a rhythm of 12 hours light and 12 dark. Science is now unpicking the cultural script that we should fear the darkness, that it's better to plug in a night light in the house or electrify bright lamps outside our homes.

Growing research suggests darkness isn't just a casualty of the social propaganda of light, but may be actively rewriting our biology. A 2025 study found that the darker the bedroom, the lower the rates of depression and the better your mental health. Meanwhile, a narrative review published in the journal Frontiers in Sleep in June excavated how our circadian rhythms—those internal clocks tuned to light and dark—depend on natural night. Disrupt those hours, and the fallout is metabolic, psychological, and cardiovascular strain. Together, the findings show darkness doesn't just calm; it orchestrates the healing, restoration, and balance we may have lost.

Step into the dark and the body seems to know what to do. Also in 2025, scientists found that chamber-based restricted environmental stimulation therapy (REST)—essentially sitting in pitch-black silence—fosters mindfulness, emotional clarity, and calm. Another recent experiment simulated starry skies and found that the darker the sky, the greater the relaxation: participants' stress markers dropped while self-rated “healing” shot up. Flotation-REST pods—soundproof tanks of body-temperature saltwater—come backed by evidence too. A meta-analysis of 27 trials found that pod sessions lower cortisol, steady blood pressure, and sharpen task performance. 

Tim Edensor, PhD, is a cultural geographer at Manchester Metropolitan University who has spent decades mapping what he calls the nightscape. He tried a pod himself.

“I found it very relaxing. Everything's silent, you can't hear anything—complete enclosure. You lie in this capsule. Some people feel trapped, but it didn't bother me. The most significant thing—you float in liquid with the same density as your body. So you can't feel your body at all. All senses fade. It's amazingly calming,” he says. Like being in your mother's womb, sort of?

“Maybe,” Edensor says. “But some say there's actually a glow in the womb—light seeps through the mother's body. But here, it's nothing. Not like anything.” Yet he is quick to point out these pods are more than therapy. They prove a larger point: light isn't neutral. It disciplines. It orders. It erases.

In his book, From Light to Dark, he investigated how Western culture turned night into a villain. Think fear, sin, even racial stigma, while light stood for truth and salvation. Those metaphors stuck. “That vocabulary is so powerful it's very hard to dislodge,” Edensor says. Neuroscience backs him up: brain scans reveal that phrases like “grasping an idea” fire the same motor circuits as physical grasping, proving words don't just mirror thought—they steer it. “Before electricity, after the sun set, the world sank into a true obscurity. You could stumble into ditches, be attacked by animals or other people—you couldn't see very much. So people invented ways to cope, and those responses remain,” Edensor says.

But here's the paradox: after centuries of fearing shadow, science now warns us about too much light. A 2025 meta-analysis on artificial illumination at night (ALAN)  linked it to disrupted circadian rhythms, metabolic disease, mood disorders, and even elevated cancer risk. Cities live in “permanent noon,” erasing not just stars but perhaps pieces of our inner selves.

Enter David Eagleman, PhD, a Stanford neuroscientist. One of his hallmark demonstrations of sensory substitution suggested that darkness enables the brain's inner vision. Building on classic tactile-vision experiments, his lab developed wearable devices, like the VEST, which translates sound into patterns of vibration on the skin. Over time, users report perceiving the information almost as if they were “seeing” or “hearing” it. Brain scans confirm the effect: the visual cortex—the brain's sight-processing hub at the back of the head—fires in response to touch, proving that our senses are not fixed, but negotiable. When light drops away, vision recedes, and cortical real estate shifts to sound, touch, and smell. Dimness doesn't just change what we perceive; it redistributes the senses themselves. 

That sensory reshuffling may be playing out in your head right now.

As you read this article, competition squeezes your brain in a primal rivalry: the inner world versus the outer. “The brain is always trying to do two things—it's always trying to monitor the internal world and the external world. And so the default mode network is much more involved in monitoring the inside world,” Eagleman says.

This network is that part of the brain that hums when we daydream, reflect, remember, or imagine the future, and it is in constant tug-of-war with the sensory flood outside. Eagleman pushes the idea further in his paper in the journal Frontiers in Neuroscience. According to “Defensive Activation Theory”—one of the most-cited ideas in dream research—the battle between the external noise and inner soliloquy goes on continuously. Eagleman suggests that dreams themselves might be a defense project: the brain generates images to keep the visual cortex alive through the long hours of shut-eye.

“The reason we have dreams is the brain's way of defending its visual territory against takeover. When darkness falls, you can't see anymore, but you can still smell, taste, touch, and hear,” he says. The visual cortex won't back off. It's a provocative hypothesis, and it dovetails with his broader point: when the visual cortex dominates, “imagination and the inner monologue wither.” In other words, we don't just happen to dream in the dark—we absolutely need the dark, because it's the nocturnal blank itself that forces the brain to keep vision occupied. And, though their ultimate purpose remains mysterious to this day, many scientists say dreams matter because they help the brain consolidate memories, regulate emotions, and keep learning systems sharp.

Not all researchers believe darkness is the magic sauce of a profound inner life though. Some would rather zero in on circadian health, arguing that balance—bright days paired with truly dark nights—matters most.  A sweeping 2024 study that logged 13 million hours of personal light exposure found that brighter nights and darker days were tied to higher mortality risks, tied to disruptions in circadian rhythm. Meanwhile, those basking in more daytime brightness fared better. Another 2025 meta-analysis reviewing 74 studies concluded that light exposure boosted mood, reduced fatigue, and strengthened overall well-being.

The debate over day and night isn't going away, but the case for more darkness in our lives is gaining ground. The isolation float tank market alone is booming. It's worth about $150 million in 2025 and projected to triple to $450 million by 2033, growing at a blistering 12 percent annually. Meanwhile, the Dark Sky movement, a global push to dim streetlamps, shield fixtures, and curb light pollution, is spreading from Arizona to Slovenia. 

“Try increasing darkness or sensory deprivation and see how it feels. Do you have better memory? Better imagination? … If so, maybe it's working for you,” Eagleman suggests. Think of it as a DIY light-or-dark crash-test for your personality. And if you take it up in the witching hours afterward, you may get to meet the stranger living inside.

This lifeform's extraordinary biology could hold the key to anti-aging breakthroughs.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Homo sapiens have remarkable regenerative abilities—wounds heal, bone fractures “thread” back together, and some organs can even regrow from devastating injury—but none of these biological bonafides compares to the healing power of the humble starlet sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis). 

Located along the eastern coast of the U.S., with a few introduced populations scattered along the western U.S. coast and the southeast coast of Britain, this sea anemone is a member of the sea-dwelling phylum Cnidaria, which is well-known for its full-body regenerative abilities—so much so that some animals in this phylum, such as the jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, are functionally immortal. Because of this ability to seemingly defy the aging process, these animals have figured prominently in anti-aging research.

Now, in a study published in the journal Science Advances, researchers from the University of Vienna have possibly identified small, multi-potent cells in scarlet sea anemones that basically allow cnidarians to continually drink from the proverbial fountain of youth. In humans, stems cells allow limited regeneration of certain cells in our body (which is why they're central to the exploration of anti-aging therapies), however, other animals display much greater, whole-body regenerative abilities compared to us humans. 

Because it can reproduce asexually (though it can multiply sexually as well) and can be raised easily in laboratory conditions, N. vectensis has quickly become the go-to species for studying the immortal abilities of cnidarians more broadly (a concept known as a “model organism”). While scientists have known that the scarlet sea anemone shows little to no signs of aging, they haven't been able to identify stem cells that drive this unending youth mainly due to their extremely small size.

University of Vienna's Ulrich Technau, the senior author of this new study, and his team used a new method called “single cell genomics” in the hunt for these missing stem cells. The scientists were able to discern the stem cell lineage of certain cells developed based on transcriptome profiles, which are a collection of mRNA transcripts. 

“By combining single-cell gene expression analyses and transgenesis,” University of Vienna's Andreas Denner, the first author of the study, said in a press statement. “We have now been able to identify a large population of cells in the sea anemone that form differentiated cells such as nerve cells and glandular cells and are therefore candidates for multipotent stem cells.”

The team looked specifically at highly-conserved (i.e. unchanged via evolution) genes nanos and piwi, which are regulatory proteins involved in stem cell differentiation as well as gametogenesis—the process of creating germ cells and gametes (sperm and eggs). When the team mutated the nanos2 gene using CRISPR gene scissors, they discovered that this protein was necessary for forming germ cells as well as somatic cells and likely appeared in nature around  600 million years ago. 

Now that scientists have enticing stem cell candidates, future studies will delve deeper into the mechanisms that make cnidarians, such as the scarlet sea anemone, adept fighters against the ravages of aging that afflict nearly every other species on the planet.

New York City's Rats Have a Secret Nightlife—And a Language Humans Can't Hear

A new preprint field study reveals that New York City's rats aren't just survivors—they're talkative city dwellers with their own hidden nightlife. Mapping their movements and conversations could offer insights to transform urban planning and pest control

Here in New York City, we humans crown ourselves rulers of the five boroughs—but the kingdom is split. We cohabit with a parallel society that commutes along subway rails, picnics in parks and patronizes trash cans like they're Restaurant Row. A new field study watched them the way New Yorkers often watch each other: from a respectful distance and with digital tech. The findings shed light on how rats have adapted to city life—and how chatty they are. “There's this kind of secret language that rats are communicating in with each other that we don't hear,” says Emily Mackevicius, a neuroscientist and a co-author of the study. “They're very social,” adds Ralph Peterson, another study co-author. “They're rugged, and they're New Yorkers themselves: persistent and resilient and able to thrive in a very extreme environment.”

At three Manhattan locations—a park, a subway platform and a sidewalk—the team used a specialized wireless recorder to eavesdrop on the rats' ultrasonic conversations, which humans can't hear. They placed thermal cameras on tripods or held them by hand to record the warm bodies moving like glowing, otherworldly specters along the cooler ground. Dmitry Batenkov, a team member who works with machine learning and computational modeling, then converted the two-dimensional videos into three dimensions because 2D recordings distort the size and movement of animals, making rats closer to the camera appear larger.

New York City is home to an estimated three million rats—approximately one for every three humans. Virtually all of these are Rattus norvegicus—the brown rat, aka the Norway rat—a larger and more robust species than the black rat (Rattus rattus), which arrived first on ships in the 1600s but was displaced by the brown rat in the 1700s. Since then about 500 generations of brown rats have lived here and have developed unique genetic adaptations related to metabolism, diet, nervous system and locomotion. Even the shape of their heads has changed. And to survive, they need a single daily ounce of water and food, the latter of which we provide in abundance, often processed.

Over this past summer in New York City, the research team—Mackevicius, Peterson, Batenkov and Ahmed El Hady, a neuroscientist who has studied rats and collective behavior—came together with a simple yet powerful idea: take what is known about rats from lab research and see how it holds up in the places we share with them. They wanted to do so not just to understand the animals' behavior and cognition in the urban wild but also so that city planners, building managers and public‑health teams could craft decisions with real data to make city life a little less—squeaky. If scientists can more precisely measure rats' complex habits and predilections, they can apply those data to trash pickup timing, building design, disease risk near burrows and even the question of which blocks attract big, bold rats versus skittish juveniles. Peterson, a computational neuroscientist, sums the concept up succinctly. “It's like Sun Tzu says in The Art of War: to defeat your enemy, you have to understand your enemy.”

"To defeat your enemy, you have to understand your enemy."

In 1944 Joseph Mitchell, the legendary New Yorker writer who chronicled the city's overlooked characters, wrote about the metropolis's shadow mascot: “Anyone who has been confronted by a rat in the bleakness of a Manhattan dawn and has seen it whirl and slink away, its claws rasping against the pavement, thereafter understands fully why this beast has been for centuries a symbol of the Judas and the stool pigeon, of soullessness in general.”

But maybe Mitchell was wrong about the soulless part. Rats are the dolphins of the sewage system; they chatter constantly as they run along the sidewalk in packs, peeking from holes, scavenging beneath grates or slipping into human-audible squeaks during scuffles by the dumpsters. One of the rats that the team recorded even soliloquized alone inside a garbage bag—perhaps offering a Yelp review for passing comrades.

The study, which was released as a preprint paper that has not yet been peer-reviewed, also revealed that the rats modulated their ultrasonic squeaking based on ambient sound. In the subway system, which was louder than parks and sidewalks, rats communicated more loudly. But the moment that truly surprised Mackevicius was in the street. “There was an ambulance going by, and you could look at that in the spectrogram, and the rat vocalizations were louder than the ambulance,” she says. “They're just kind of screaming to each other, but we just don't hear it.” Peterson, who has studied rodent vocalizations in the lab, was struck by how talkative the vermin were. “Why would you vocalize if not to some end?” he asks. “The fact that we don't understand that yet—this is one of the questions that really keeps me up.”

The study also suggested that the city rats' size and behavior were linked. Younger rats were more likely to venture out together; the team saw groups of up to 20. “The smaller ones are likely juvenile rats, so they're kind of learning how to forage, and they tend to move a bit more slowly and a bit less in coordination, with bursts of movement,” Mackevicius says. But sometimes the researchers also saw lone rats. “These are big, honking, huge rats,” Peterson says. “This seems like some sort of role that this single rat has, to go out into the environment and assay its surroundings and bring food back or relay information back to the rest of the colony. It had me asking a lot of questions about social hierarchy and delegation of roles and tasks.” Mitchell's 1944 article said exterminators called old rats “Moby Dicks,” a reference to the giant white whale in Herman Melville's classic novel. “Rats that survive to the age of four are the wisest and the most cynical beasts on earth,” Mitchell quoted an exterminator as saying—which matches Peterson's observation about the big, solo scavengers: “They kind of know what they're doing out there,” he says.

“Rats that survive to the age of four are the wisest and the most cynical beasts on earth."

In Mitchell's article, one New York exterminator argued that buildings had to be rat-proofed, that killing rodents was a waste of time. “It's like taking aspirin for a cancer,” he said. Some contemporary research concurs, noting that poison can endanger pets and the ecosystem and that rats reproduce too quickly for poisoning to work. They become sexually mature in just two to three months, with females going into heat every few days and able to conceive within a day after giving birth. Pregnancies last only about three weeks, producing litters of six to 12 pups—and sometimes up to 20. Under ideal conditions, a single pair could theoretically generate thousands of descendants in a year, though survival rates keep numbers much lower.

“What you need to do is create environments that they don't like,” Mackevicius says. At a city rat-mitigation-training event for community gardens, she learned that rats avoid open space—a tendency confirmed by lab experiments. For instance, community gardeners in New York City often remove clutter to make use of this aversion. Similarly, trash cans tucked into an alley might look like a romantic dinner for two in a dim alcove, but the same cans in an open space could feel like a picnic on the Cross Bronx Expressway. This acute awareness that rats have of open and protected spaces was the other reason that Batenkov converted the 2D videos into 3D: to precisely measure the rats' behaviors in relationship to their settings. This data could someday even be used to generate rat's‑eye simulations to show exactly how they navigate the city.

“Rat-mitigation strategies have been the same for a long time, but the rat numbers are rising,” Peterson says. “I don't think putting a box with a little piece of cheese in it is going to do anything.... People underestimate how smart the species is.” He believes we should at least consider more futuristic solutions, even if they might sound zany. For instance, research on gerbils—another highly social rodent—has shown that they will respond to recorded gerbil vocalizations played on speakers. “We can build little robotic systems that sense [rat] movement and shine light at them or sense their movement and play certain vocalizations back at them,” he suggests, “and do this in a very dynamic way that addresses this issue of how to mitigate a smart species.” At very least, the city could use the team's surveillance system to create a low-cost network that detects rat hot spots and infestation spikes—a real-time rodent weather report that would allow city officials to target their responses. This humane, data-driven pest control would be safer for people, pets, and the ecosystem and could even be generalized to deal with other urban cotenants, from raccoons to stray dogs.

The study left the team with tantalizing questions: What are rats really saying? How smart are they? What are their burrows like? Peterson recalls watching a battle-scarred rat on the subway tracks as a train came through. “The train left... and we saw the rat flopped over in a seemingly dead posture. It must have been a minute. Then it popped back up and started running away. It's perhaps evidence of a rat playing dead in the wild, which we know that other species do.”

Mackevicius had previously been studying birds in central park, and when she started on rats, she was surprised by how friends reacted. “More people asked to go out on fieldwork with me for rats than for birds,” she says. Many passing New Yorkers also approached the researchers as they worked, asking what they were doing and getting excited upon learning they were studying rats. “Then they would offer their own personal rat story,” Peterson recalls. “‘Oh, if you want to see rats, come to this place. I see them. They're as big as cats. They do this. They do that. They chew through steel.' There's this kind of childlike intrigue that everyone in the city has, which feels interesting, especially in a very divisive time. It's like rats are bringing people together.”

Johns Hopkins researchers have discovered new materials and a new process that could advance the ever-escalating quest to make smaller, faster and affordable microchips used across modern electronics -- in everything from cellphones to cars, appliances to airplanes.

The team of scientists has discovered how to create circuits that are so small they're invisible to the naked eye using a process that is both precise and economical for manufacturing.

The findings are published on September 11 in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering.

"Companies have their roadmaps of where they want to be in 10 to 20 years and beyond," said Michael Tsapatsis, a Bloomberg Distinguish Professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at Johns Hopkins University. "One hurdle has been finding a process for making smaller features in a production line where you irradiate materials quickly and with absolute precision to make the process economical."

The advanced lasers required for imprinting on the miniscule formats already exist, Tsapatsis added, but researchers needed new materials and new processes to accommodate ever smaller microchips.

Microchips are flat pieces of silicon with imprinted circuitries that execute basic functions. During production, manufacturers coat silicon wafers with a radiation-sensitive material to create a very fine coating called a "resist." When a beam of radiation is pointed at the resist, it sparks a chemical reaction that burns details into the wafer, drawing patterns and circuitry.

However, the higher-powered radiation beams that are needed to carve out ever-smaller details on chips do not interact strongly enough with traditional resists.

Previously, researchers from Tsapatsis's lab and the Fairbrother Research Group at Johns Hopkins found that resists made of a new class of metal-organics can accommodate that higher-powered radiation process, called "beyond extreme ultraviolet radiation" (B-EUV), which has the potential to make details smaller than the current standard size of 10 nanometers. Metals like zinc absorb the B-EUV light and generate electrons that cause chemical transformations needed to imprint circuit patterns on an organic material called imidazole.

This research marks one of the first times scientists have been able to deposit these imidazole-based metal-organic resists from solution at silicon-wafer scale, controlling their thickness with nanometer precision. To develop the chemistry needed to coat the silicon wafer with the metal-organic materials, the team combined experiments and models from Johns Hopkins University, East China University of Science and Technology, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Soochow University, Brookhaven National Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The new methodology, which they call chemical liquid deposition (CLD), can be precisely engineered and lets researchers quickly explore various combinations of metals and imidazoles.

"By playing with the two components (metal and imidazole), you can change the efficiency of absorbing the light and the chemistry of the following reactions. And that opens us up to creating new metal-organic pairings," Tsapatsis said. "The exciting thing is there are at least 10 different metals that can be used for this chemistry, and hundreds of organics."

The researchers have started experimenting with different combinations to create pairings specifically for B-EUV radiation, which they say will likely be used in manufacturing in the next 10 years.

"Because different wavelengths have different interactions with different elements, a metal that is a loser in one wavelength can be a winner with the other," Tsapatsis said. "Zinc is not very good for extreme ultraviolet radiation, but it's one of the best for the B-EUV."

The concept of quantum entanglement is emblematic of the gap between classical and quantum physics. Referring to a situation in which it is impossible to describe the physics of each photon separately, this key characteristic of quantum mechanics defies the classical expectation that each particle should have a reality of its own, which gravely concerned Einstein. Understanding the potential of this concept is essential for the realization of powerful new quantum technologies.

Developing such technologies will require the ability to freely generate a multi-photon quantum entangled state, and then to efficiently identify what kind of entangled state is present. However, when performing conventional quantum tomography, a method commonly used for state estimation, the number of measurements required grows exponentially with the number of photons, posing a significant data collection problem.

If available, an entangled measurement can identify the entangled state with a one-shot approach. Such a measurement for the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger -- GHZ -- entangled quantum state has been realized, but for the W state, the other representative entangled multi-photon state, it has been neither proposed nor discovered experimentally.

This motivated a team of researchers at Kyoto University and Hiroshima University to take on this challenge, ultimately succeeding in developing a new method of entangled measurement to identify the W state.

"More than 25 years after the initial proposal concerning the entangled measurement for GHZ states, we have finally obtained the entangled measurement for the W state as well, with genuine experimental demonstration for 3-photon W states," says corresponding author Shigeki Takeuchi.

The team focused on the characteristics of the W state's cyclic shift symmetry, and theoretically proposed a method to create an entangled measurement using a photonic quantum circuit that performs quantum Fourier transformation for the W state of any number of photons.

They created a device to demonstrate the proposed method for three photons using high-stability optical quantum circuits, which allowed the device to operate stably without active control for an extended period of time. By inserting three single photons into the device in appropriate polarization states, the team was able to demonstrate that the device can distinguish different types of three-photon W states, each corresponding to a specific non-classical correlation between the three input photons. The researchers were able to evaluate the fidelity of the entangled measurement, which is equal to the probability of obtaining the correct result for a pure W-state input.

This achievement opens the door for quantum teleportation, or the transfer of quantum information. It could also lead to new quantum communication protocols, the transfer of multi-photon quantum entangled states, and new methods for measurement-based quantum computing.

"In order to accelerate the research and development of quantum technologies, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of basic concepts to come up with innovative ideas," says Takeuchi.

In the future, the team aims to apply their method to a larger-scale, more general multi-photon quantum entangled state, and plans to develop on-chip photonic quantum circuits for entangled measurements.

Unlike conventional phases of matter, the so-called non-equilibrium quantum phases are defined by their dynamical and time-evolving properties -- a behavior that cannot be captured by traditional equilibrium thermodynamics. One particularly rich class of non-equilibrium states arises in Floquet systems -- quantum systems that are periodically driven in time. This rhythmic driving can give rise to entirely new forms of order that cannot exist under any equilibrium conditions, revealing phenomena that are fundamentally beyond the reach of conventional phases of matter.

Using a 58 superconducting qubit quantum processor, the team from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Princeton University, and Google Quantum AI realized a Floquet topologically ordered state, a phase that had been theoretically proposed but never before observed. They directly imaged the characteristic directed motions at the edge and developed a novel interferometric algorithm to probe the system's underlying topological properties. This allowed them to witness the dynamical "transmutation" of exotic particles - a hallmark that has been theoretically predicted for these exotic quantum states.

Quantum computer as a laboratory

"Highly entangled non-equilibrium phases are notoriously hard to simulate with classical computers," said the first author Melissa Will, PhD student at the Physics Department of the TUM School of Natural Sciences. "Our results show that quantum processors are not just computational devices - they are powerful experimental platforms for discovering and probing entirely new states of matter."

This work opens the door to a new era of quantum simulation, where quantum computers become laboratories for studying the vast and largely unexplored landscape of out-of-equilibrium quantum matter. The insights gained from these studies could have far-reaching implications, from understanding fundamental physics to designing next-generation quantum technologies.

Rainmaker Technology's bid to deploy cloud-seeding flares on small drones is being met by resistance from the airline pilots union, which has urged the Federal Aviation Administration to consider denying the startup's request unless it meets stricter safety guidelines.

The FAA's decision will signal how the regulator views weather modification by unmanned aerial systems going forward. Rainmaker's bet on small drones hangs in the balance.

The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) told the FAA that Rainmaker's petition “fails to demonstrate an equivalent level of safety” and poses “an extreme safety risk.”

However, Rainmaker CEO Augustus Doricko said an email that all of the union's objections are based on only the public notice, rather than non-public documents submitted to the FAA that outline all of the company's safety data and risk mitigations. 

Rainmaker is seeking an exemption from rules that bar small drones from carrying hazardous materials. The startup filed in July, and the FAA has yet to rule. Instead, it issued a follow-up request for information, pressing for specifics on operations and safety.

In its filing, Rainmaker proposed using two flare types, one “burn-in-place” and the other ejectable, on its Elijah quadcopter, to disperse particles that stimulate precipitation. Elijah has a maximum altitude of 15,000 feet MSL (measured from sea level), which sits inside controlled airspace where commercial airliners routinely fly. Drones need permission from Air Traffic Control to fly inside this bubble. 

Rainmaker's petition says it will operate in Class G (uncontrolled) airspace unless otherwise authorized. ALPA notes the filing doesn't clearly state where flights would occur or what altitudes would be used. However, Doricko said the documents submitted to the FAA disclosed that in addition to the flights being constrained to a max altitude of 15,000 feet MSL, they will be conducted in airspace that is predetermined to be safe by aviation authorities, “voiding any reasonable concern about high altitude flight or airspace coordination.” ALPA did not reply to TechCrunch's requests for comment. 

The union also objects to the flares themselves, citing concerns about foreign object debris and fire safety. ALPA points out that the petition does not include trajectory modeling of the ejectable casings or analysis on the environmental impacts of chemical agents.

“Regarding their objection to the use of flares, independent bodies like this administration's EPA and multiple state departments of natural resources have studied the dispersion and environmental safety of materials used in cloud seeding for over 70 years and never found any adverse effect from cloud seeding,” Doricko said.

Sam Kim, Rainmaker's aviation regulatory manager, said the company respects the pilot's union and hopes to “continue to strengthen our relationship with the organization,” but claimed the objection “shows a lack of understanding of why Rainmaker has filed for this exemption.” 

“Our use of flares in unmanned systems is solely for research purposes in a controlled flying environment and is not a part of our larger ongoing operations,” Kim added.

Doricko said that a typical Rainmaker operation disperses 50-100 grams of silver iodide, and far less than that in a flight with flares, while one hour of flight of a commercial plane releases kilograms of uncombusted volatile organics, sulfur oxides, and soot – significantly more material than a Rainmaker op.

“Rainmaker is interested in doing the best, responsible atmospheric research and is thus comparing flares to our proprietary aerosol dispersion system that will replace flares and exclusively emit silver iodide. ALPA's objection to this exemplifies their limited understanding of our CONOP, all of which contains extensive risk mitigations in the non-public docs that the FAA is reviewing now,” Doricko said.

“Regarding ALPA's concerns about coordination with aviation authorities and airspace, our flight operations consist of broadcasting signals, intentional coordination with local ATC, certified pilots, and a collision avoidance system that involves electronic and physical observers,” he said.

However, Rainmaker says the flights will occur over rural areas and over properties owned by private landlords “with whom Rainmaker has developed close working relationships.”

Cloud-seeding already happens today, largely in the western U.S., with crewed airplanes flown in coordination with state agencies. Ski resorts commission the operations to help keep their runs white, and irrigation and water districts fly them to build snowpack in the winter to help feed their reservoirs during the spring melt.

The general practice of cloud seeding dates back to the 1950s. By spraying small particles into certain clouds, scientists found they could induce precipitation. Typically, cloud-seeding operations use silver iodide for the particles, mostly because they mimic the shape of ice crystals.

When a silver iodide particle bumps into droplets of water that are super-cooled, they cause the droplet to rapidly freeze because its water is already below the freezing point. Once the ice crystal forms, it can grow quickly if conditions are right, faster than a liquid water droplet would in similar circumstances. Plus, the rapid growth helps the crystals stick around longer than a water droplet, which might evaporate before it has a chance to fall as precipitation.

Rainmaker's twist — doing this work with drones instead of pilots — could prove safer in the longer term. The company points out that the flight profiles are tightly bounded, overseen by a remote pilot and trained crews, over rural areas, with other safety checks in place.

What happens next hinges on whether the FAA thinks those mitigations are sufficient. However it's decided, the agency's response will likely set the tone for novel cloud-seeding approaches.

9/13/2025: The story has been updated to include Rainmaker's comments from Augustus Doricko, founder and CEO, and Sam Kim, Rainmaker's aviation regulatory manager.

If you work for Opendoor, the online real estate platform, you might consider polishing up your resume. The chair of the company's board recently let it slip that he thinks the firm could stand to lose almost all of its employees.

During a recent appearance on CNBC's “Squawk on the Street,” Keith Rabois, a former member of the PayPal Mafia, told a reporter that he felt that the majority of the people at his company were expendable. “There's 1,400 employees at Opendoor. I don't know what most of them do. We don't need more than 200 of them,” Rabois remarked. He added that “the advent of AI and other technologies” made the workforce reduction a “simple problem” to solve.

Rabois' apparent disinterest in maintaining a majority of Opendoor's workforce is somewhat humorous given how well the company's been doing lately. Indeed, the company's stock is up 500 percent this year. That said, the stock performance appears to largely be the result of a wave of retail investors becoming interested in the firm due to online advice spread by a hedge fund manager. As a result, the company has been dubbed a “meme stock,” which Rabois disputes.

It's unclear whether Rabois's ruthless comment was just an effort to inspire confidence in the profitability of the company. After all, if you fire almost everybody at a firm, there's a much bigger chance you'll turn a profit.

The stock soared this week, but other developments also helped buoy investor confidence—namely, the appointment of former Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO. CNBC notes that “investor” pressure had spurred the exit of former Opendoor CEO Carrie Wheeler. On Thursday, the company's stock rose a whopping 78 percent, before dipping down 13 percent on Friday, the outlet notes.

Rabois had more to say about his efforts to transform the online real estate platform: “The culture was broken,” he said, of the firm's previous management. “These people were working remotely. That doesn't work. This company was founded on the principle of innovation and working together in person. We're going to return to our roots.”

Rabois also took the opportunity to dunk on the company's diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, noting that, under its previous leadership, the firm had gone “down this DEI path,” and that Rabois intended to “fix all that.” Gizmodo reached out to Opendoor for more information about its apparent plan to upend its workforce.

Leaks tie China's state-grade DPI gear to deployments in Myanmar, Pakistan, and beyond.

Chinese censorship sprang a major leak on September 11, when researchers confirmed that more than 500GB of internal documents, source code, work logs, and internal communications from the so-called Great Firewall were dumped online, including packaging repos and operational runbooks used to build and maintain China's national traffic filtering system.

The files appear to originate from Geedge Networks, a company that has long been linked to Fang Binxing — widely described as the “father” of the Great Firewall — and from the MESA lab at the Institute of Information Engineering, a research arm of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Contained in the leak are what appear to be full build systems for deep packet inspection platforms, as well as code modules that reference the identification and throttling of specific circumvention tools. Much of the stack is geared toward DPI-based VPN detection, SSL fingerprinting, and full-session logging.

Researchers at the Great Firewall Report, who first verified and indexed the material, say the documents outline the internal architecture of a commercial platform called ‘Tiangou', which is designed for use by ISPs and border gateways. They describe it as a turnkey “Great Firewall in a box,” with initial deployments reportedly built on HP and Dell servers before shifting to Chinese-sourced hardware in response to sanctions.

A leaked deployment sheet reveals that the system was rolled out across 26 data centers in Myanmar, with live dashboards monitoring 81 million simultaneous TCP connections. The system was reportedly operated by Myanmar's state-run telecoms company and integrated into core Internet exchange points, thereby enabling mass blocking and selective filtering.

And it doesn't stop at Myanmar. Partner reporting from WIRED and Amnesty International reveals that Geedge's DPI infrastructure has been exported to other states — Pakistan, Ethiopia, and Kazakhstan being among the recipients — where it's often used alongside lawful intercept platforms. In Pakistan, Geedge's equipment allegedly forms part of a larger system known as WMS 2.0, which is capable of conducting blanket surveillance on mobile networks in real-time.

The scale and specificity of this leak offer a rare glimpse into how China's censorship check is engineered and commercialized. WIRED's reporting also describes how the leaked documents show Geedge's system can intercept unencrypted HTTP sessions.

So far, researchers have only just begun to comb through the source-code archive, which remains under-evaluated mainly. However, analysts argue that the presence of build logs and dev notes could help identify protocol-level weaknesses or operational missteps that censorship circumvention tools may exploit.

The entire archive is now mirrored by Enlace Hacktivista and others, with researchers urging caution for anyone downloading or examining it. Air-gapped VMs or other sandboxed environments are strongly recommended.

My computer engineering professors also emphasized user centered design. For one of Google's top scientists to bring this up is an admission that they won't, or can't, design a good user experience for their tools.

reply

Same goes for user-centered design. Trying to make something user-friendly is one thing, successfully doing it is another. Large organizations are especially poor at user-friendly design because the underlying structures which support that goal don't exist. Organizational science is still in its infancy.

reply

Everything you see of its character, including emphasizing tests and practice, follows from that. Talking about good UX is miles away.

I mean, we had five years of English classes in high school, and by the end of high school, less than five out of 30 people in my cohort were able to string a couple of sentences together in English. And my class was made up of serious, studious young people. It seems to me that the time was not well spent, but did the teacher, a caring and generally competent person, reflect on the poor results? I highly doubt it.

reply

The issue with "learning to learn" is that it does not include the foundational skill of "how to communicate". Far too often it is not a lack of desire to learn, it is the inability to communicate what one is trying to learn. When seeking help, not only does the seeker have difficulty expressing their situation, those trying to help are not taught how to listen and will offer solutions to an issue only starting to be explained. This difficulty is then compounded by self conversation bias that negatively spins against the person seeking. That is two very high hurdles: negative self bias, and inarticulate communications while seeking guidance.

I did not find it to be true almost at all, and I tested many other people on it. When I voiced my concerns, the usual answer was, "Yes, but when you pick up a book, you will remember". And then I asked, "Try it", and the subsequent answer was, "I have to admit you are right".The "re-absorption speed" is heavily confounded by general IQ and the kind of cognitive stimulation one receives in daily life, but the original learnings are mostly gone.
Among other things, this is why retrieval practice is important: it slows down the "forgetting rate".

I'd rather hire a hungry junior that finished a bootcamp, that has a drive and ability to absorb new things and adapt to changing environments, over somebody who's got 10 years of experience and can't do shit outside of their comfort zone.The number of people who aren't able to learn and adapt to changing times, new tools, new ways of working, etc. is shocking.

I can teach somebody who finished a 6-month coding bootcamp Go, all the internal tooling, go over the business with them, etc. if they have these skills and end up with a productive mid-level engineer who gets shit done in a few years. What I can't teach is the drive and ability to learn, that's a much longer process and if you don't already have it then I'm not prepared to develop it.Hell, outside of looking for signs of obvious bullshit I stopped giving a shit about resumes. Your work history does me no good, your education doesn't matter to me, and your references are useless beyond making sure you aren't straight up lying to me about your employment history. Every single time I have hired somebody who has 5 years of "experience" working with technologies I bullet pointed on a JD they ended up fumbling the moment they had to do something new. Doing leetcode, pair programming sessions, take-home assignments, whiteboarding system designs, etc. for SWE positions did nothing to really improve this; for SRE/DevOps roles I tried trivia questions (how are containers implemented - like what kernel technologies do they use and what do they do, how would you go about investigating why a service is consuming 100% CPU time), throwing them at broken VM's and more take-home assignments.AI tools only make this skillset more important - I can throw Junie, Claude Code, or Copilot and small task and end up with...an implementation. But they still fuck up, constantly, and yet again, anything that's not already been done, regularly, requires a lot of guidance from an engineer in the loop. And with the god damned death of the web thanks to AI slop being posted anywhere, the ability to find answers and reason through problems is only going to become more important when these tools fail miserably for the third time in a row.

While we understand the importance of warming up for physical activity and recognize the need for a certain aptitude for running, weightlifting, or boxing, when it comes to more intellectual activities, we often leave things to chance: sometimes we are more alert and receptive, while at other times we are less so.Over the years, I have found enormous benefit in practicing autogenic training, a more Western and scientific version of meditative practices that today seem to arouse the interest of those who deal with these things. I am mentally more alert, more receptive, and learning, which is always challenging, is faster.

In practice, the problem you run into, even with intrinsically motivated learners, is that they will not use the active learning techniques they are studying. Often times they will revert back to rote memorization, highlighting, re-reading, copying notes, cramming, etc rather than use the things they are learning about learning to learn the subject of learning itself.I think you have to start with:1) Teaching learning in the first place. No one teaches learning how to learn, so we should just start there. We already have captive audiences in the form of schools, we just put the cart before the horse and teach subjects and hope the skill of learning emerges. This is poor pedagogy.2) Work with the students and ensure that they are actually using the learning techniques they are being taught on the subject of learning itself. This is the only way I've seen it work.If you try to learn how to learn using passive learning techniques, you won't learn the subject of learning, which is what I think OP was referring to. People who do not know how to learn use passive learning techniques which results in rapid forgetting. They have to use the active learning techniques they are learning on the subject of learning itself.

There's also the fact that kids are being taught the very basics, the sorts of things increasingly intelligent models are most likely to be able to solve first. I don't think there's any level of effort that can be put into designing assignments to get around this.Similar to how teachers haven't really been able to do anything to stop kids from sticking their algebra problems into wolframalpha or other tools besides just making them do the work in class (which then cuts into teaching time).Beyond a certain point, all that can be done is for teachers to try to instill the importance of practice into students, and for parents to be more proactive in monitoring how their kid is doing their homework.Maybe we'll see an increase in after-school classes for kids to do homework in, under teacher supervision.

1. Have the kids learn new things
2. Have the kids reach a desired level of competencyLearning happens where you are at, not where the teacher wants you to be. Every student is at a different place in understanding. It's impossible without 1-on-1 instruction to really maximize learning.Competency is only determined via testing. Learning doesn't require testing at all, you can just speak to a student to get a good idea if they're making some progress, any progress. Competency? That basically demands a test, because it has a particular bar in mind.Now students know they need to pass the bar, somehow, but the anxiety of that is going to cause issues with them just trying to learn. This is unfixable though, because the outside pressures demand students have some level of competency otherwise teachers are viewed as failures.

It's amazing what kids can learn if they just spent a little bit of time with a 1-on-1 instructor/advisor. The anxiety you mentioned can be crippling and something I deal with regularly. Even some of the "gifted" kids (perhaps due to the expectations) have trouble avoiding the trap of overindexing on productivity/competency metrics. They're not even self aware of it, just accepts it as normal.For most kids I have to go through the exercise of separating these two concerns, the learning part and the signaling part, early so they can put things in perspective.

Billionaire Elon Musk is taking issue with a recent investigation by the Houston Chronicle and The Texas Newsroom that raised questions about a flood tunnel project he's pitching to address Houston's chronic flooding woes. But experts said his response, which he did not explain to the newsrooms, isn't supported by facts or data.

Last month, the newsrooms reported that Musk's tunneling company, The Boring Co., has been lobbying elected officials for months to allow it to build tunnels under Houston for flood mitigation. Boring has proposed digging two 12-foot-wide tunnels beneath Buffalo Bayou — the main waterway running through central Houston — to carry stormwater out of neighborhoods and toward the Gulf of Mexico during major storms. Experts say, however, that larger tunnels, closer to 30 to 40 feet in diameter, could carry far more water and be more effective.

Musk and representatives with Boring did not respond to interview requests or answer questions the newsrooms sent in advance of last month's story about whether Boring's smaller tunnels would be able to handle the scale of floodwater Houston is likely to encounter in the future.

Instead, Musk waited until hours after the story published to post a response on X, the social media company he's owned since 2022.

“Boring Company tunnels will work and cost <10% of alternatives,” his Aug. 28 post read. “If more flow is needed, additional tunnels can be built and furthermore they can be route water from many parts of the city, not just one.”

The post was written in response to a post on X from U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt, a Houston Republican who helped arrange private meetings with government officials in Harris County and across the state to sell them on Boring's flood tunnel plan. Hunt also did not respond to questions from the newsrooms ahead of publication of the original story, but he weighed in on X after the story was published.

“A lifelong Houstonian and Texas Congressman spoke to the smartest man on planet earth about solving a generational flooding issue in our city that no one else will fix,” Hunt wrote.

Musk's post offered no data or engineering explanation to back up his assertions. So the newsrooms examined his statements, comparing them against flood studies, and interviewed engineering experts, some of whom pointed out key technical and logistical challenges with the Boring plan.

One of Musk's claims is likely false, and the others are not yet possible to verify with certainty, according to the newsrooms' examination.

Again, when the newsrooms pressed Musk and Boring representatives to explain the tech billionaire's claims, they did not respond. Nor did Hunt.

Musk's proposal carries a lower price tag than the estimated cost of the larger system the flood control district has spent years and millions of dollars studying. But that's partly because the two are strikingly different proposals.

Hunt's team has said Boring's Buffalo Bayou project would cost $760 million, according to internal communications obtained by the newsrooms through public records requests.

The county's flood control district, on the other hand, proposed in 2022 tunnels of 30 to 40 feet in diameter for that segment of the system at a price of about $4.6 billion.

Since the project is still in the research phase, the county numbers are preliminary. But based on the figures available, Boring's proposal would cost closer to one-sixth of the county's estimate — not less than 10%, as Musk's post suggested. So Musk seems to be exaggerating how much cheaper his system would be.

Flood control experts also maintained that the reduced price is somewhat proportional to the reduced capacity of Boring's narrower tunnels. Two 12-foot tunnels would provide less than one-fifth of the volume that a single 40-foot tunnel offers.

That means they would divert less water from vulnerable areas than one large tunnel.

Jim Blackburn, a Houston environmental lawyer and flood policy expert, said while Musk's company deserves a fair hearing, cheaper does not automatically mean better.

“If it's a smaller tunnel, then I would expect it to cost less,” Blackburn said. “You've got to look at how much flood mitigation you get for the dollars you spend.”

Emily Woodell, a spokesperson for the Harris County Flood Control District, said the agency needs more information before it can weigh in on any of Musk's claims.

“We'd have to do a lot of study before anything could even potentially move forward, so I wouldn't want to speculate,” she said. “Until we have a project or another study, we'd point people to our website for the reports and data we've compiled to date.”

Musk's post said if more floodwater needs to be moved, more tunnels can be added. Engineers said it is not that simple.

Larry Dunbar, a veteran water resources engineer who has advised Houston-area governmental agencies on drainage issues, said based on size alone, it would take about 11 of Boring's tunnels to carry the same amount of water as one large tunnel. Lined up side by side, with enough room between them to keep the ground stable, the full system could span hundreds of feet. That would require securing rights to more land and building more access points for maintenance, he said.

And each new phase of construction might bring another round of reviews and mobilization costs, Dunbar said, undercutting the speed and affordability that Boring has touted as key advantages of its proposal.

“The issues start to just get more and more complicated,” Dunbar said. “Not that it can't be done, but just to kind of throw out there — ‘Oh, if we need more, we'll just do more' — well, there's a lot more to it than that.”

Harris County Commissioner Tom Ramsey, who has an engineering background, agreed. More tunnels would also mean more equipment to maintain, which could drive up long-term costs, Ramsey said.

He added that the county would need to decide on the full plan at the outset so all system elements like pumps, drains and outfalls can be designed properly.

“It would not be simple to just add additional tunnels later,” Ramsey said.

John Blount, a former Harris County engineer who retired after more than three decades with the county, similarly dismissed Musk's suggestion that Boring could just build more tunnels if the initial plan falls short.

While working on other infrastructure projects, Blount said, he has come across a number of contractors capable of building tunnels large enough to handle the job properly the first time.

“You don't start small and figure it out later,” he said. “This whole concept of putting in 20% of what you need to see if it's enough makes zero sense.”

Musk argued that Boring's tunnels could be used in different parts of the city, not just along Buffalo Bayou.

Some local officials agreed that Musk's tunnels might actually work better for smaller watersheds that do not take on as much water as Buffalo Bayou.

Ramsey said he supports exploring smaller tunnels for areas like Hunting and Halls bayous, which run through other parts of the city and also need resources to strengthen their flood protection. The county commissioner publicly called for a closer look at narrower tunnels during a commissioners court meeting in April, after Hunt had pitched him on Boring's proposal in February.

“It's another tool in our toolbox to help mitigate flooding. And certainly with what's happening in the Hill Country,” Ramsey said, referring to recent deadly floods in Central Texas, “and what continues to happen in Harris County, we need as many tools as we can possibly get.”

Woodell, with the flood control district, told the newsrooms in August that the agency initially focused on large-diameter tunnels because engineering studies identified them as the most effective option for a countywide system.

However, she said smaller tunnels could be a viable solution in certain areas. Since that idea had not been a focus of research, she added, more study would be needed before any such project could move forward.

Colleen Gilbert, executive director of the Greens Bayou Coalition — a nonprofit that works to protect neighborhoods near Greens Bayou, in northeast Houston — said communities in her watershed are desperate for relief as well. They would welcome the massive storm tunnel once proposed by Harris County, she said, but even smaller tunnels would be better than nothing.

“We would be thrilled to have any and all possibilities looked at,” Gilbert said. “If Congressman Hunt and The Boring Co. are looking at this, we are delighted to hear it.”

Experts and officials the newsrooms interviewed, however, still took issue with Musk's sweeping statement that “Boring Company tunnels will work” because it doesn't take into account complexities of the project or that success largely depends on what kind of system the county ultimately wants.

In a two-page memo Boring sent to Hunt's team in February and that was circulated among local officials in the county, the company framed the pitch as an “innovative, cost-effective solution” to Houston's chronic flooding.

“We are confident in our ability to execute this project successfully,” wrote Jim Fitzgerald, Boring's global head of business development.

But Dunbar said the only way to evaluate Musk's claim is to focus on the purpose of the stormwater tunnels.

If the goal is to build as large a project as possible for the lowest price, Dunbar said, Boring's proposal might fit the bill. But if the goal is to shield lives and property from another Hurricane Harvey-level flooding event, he believes the smaller-scale project simply does not measure up.

“You have to have some underlying reason why you build this tunnel, what you're trying to accomplish,” Dunbar said. “And I have not heard that Elon has given that answer.”

Rock Owens, retired Harris County attorney for environmental affairs who represented agencies including the flood control district, said he has seen local officials repeatedly greenlighting massive projects that were not well thought out and led to costly legal battles.

He pointed, for instance, to flood control issues along White Oak Bayou in northwest Houston. In a lengthy legal battle that began in 1999, about 400 homeowners in the area blamed the county for approving upstream development without adequate flood control, which they said caused repeated flooding of their homes.

The Texas Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of the county in 2016. But Owens said even unsuccessful lawsuits are costly and the kind of challenge that could have exposed the county to a substantial damages award.

Musk's ethos of moving fast and worrying about consequences later, Owens said, only heightens the risk.

“That works fine in the private sector, but not the public sector,” he said. “We're not looking at Mr. Musk's personal fortune; we're looking at the livelihood and lifelong investments of people who live here.”

The Federal Aviation Administration announced it's proposing $3.1 million in fines against Boeing for safety violations in late 2023 and early 2024, according to a press release from the government agency on Friday.

The safety violations include an incident on January 5, 2024, when a door plug fell out of an Alaska Airlines flight traveling from Portland, Oregon. The door plug fell out of the Boeing 737 Max 9 while in flight, though thankfully nobody was hurt.

The door plug was eventually found in the backyard of a Portland schoolteacher and highlighted recent safety concerns in the wake of two deadly crashes, one in 2018 and another in 2019, that killed 346 people in total. Boeing struck a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice earlier this year to avoid criminal charges in those crashes.

The fine of just $3.1 million may not seem like much for such a large company, but the FAA touts it as the “maximum statutory civil penalty authority consistent with law.”

The FAA also notes that a Boeing employee pressured a member of the FAA's Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) to sign off on a Boeing 737-MAX plane so that the plane manufacturer could meet its delivery schedule. The FAA has faced criticism for not being independent enough from the companies it regulates.

The FAA fine also relates to various quality control problems, as the agency explains in its press release:

The FAA identified hundreds of quality system violations at Boeing's 737 factory in Renton, Washington, and Boeing subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems' 737 factory in Wichita, Kansas. Additionally, Boeing presented two unairworthy aircraft to the FAA for airworthiness certificates and failed to follow its quality system.

Reached for comment over email, a Boeing spokesperson said the company regrets the door-plug accident and continues to work on “strengthening our safety culture and improving first-time quality and accountability across our operations.”

“Last year, under the oversight of the FAA, we instituted a Safety & Quality Plan with key performance indicators to enhance safety management and quality assurance in airplane production,” the statement continued. “Our team continues to implement these improvements, such as investing in workforce training, strengthening production system compliance and encouraging employees to speak up.”

Boeing has 30 days to reply to the FAA's letter about the proposed fines. The full letter has not been made public. The agency didn't respond to questions emailed Friday evening. Gizmodo will update this post when we hear back.

This week on the GeekWire Podcast: Mark Briggs, an executive coach, AI strategist, and author from the Seattle region, explains why your “personal operating system” needs an upgrade, and how to use AI to get more time back in your day.

Wait a second, what happens to human executive coaches in the world of AI? Mark answers that question by pointing out that while coaching apps already exist, the accountability of looking another person in the eye is something AI can't replace. 

Listen below, or subscribe in any podcast app, and keep reading for takeaways from the podcast discussion and Mark's recent GeekWire columns.

Put your notes in one place: Stop scattering thoughts across Google Docs, Evernote, paper notebooks, and sticky notes. Consolidating them into one platform lets AI summarize, connect ideas, and extract insights you'd never find on your own.

Ask AI the “most obvious objection”: Before you send a proposal or share an idea, have AI tell you what the pushback will be. Mark uses this trick to see blind spots and strengthen his work before others point them out.

Create a BossGPT: Instead of waiting for a manager's feedback, train a custom GPT on their style and priorities. Use it as a stand-in to pressure-test your ideas and get instant responses that mirror how your real boss might react.

Use AI to generate meeting follow-ups: At the end of a meeting, ask three questions: What did we decide? Who's responsible? Who else needs to know? Share the answers with your team to create accountability and use the output from the meeting to build an institutional memory.

Summarize your own progress: At the end of a project or a review period, ask your personal AI to analyze your collection of notes and meeting transcripts. Mark does this with six months of his client notes in Notion to find “key areas of growth” and has even asked his AI to summarize his entire year of work to identify opportunities for the next year.

Challenge your team to rewrite their job descriptions: Instead of just encouraging general learning, give your team a specific mission: find AI tools to automate the tedious parts of their jobs so they can focus on work that requires uniquely human skills.

While we understand the importance of warming up for physical activity and recognize the need for a certain aptitude for running, weightlifting, or boxing, when it comes to more intellectual activities, we often leave things to chance: sometimes we are more alert and receptive, while at other times we are less so.Over the years, I have found enormous benefit in practicing autogenic training, a more Western and scientific version of meditative practices that today seem to arouse the interest of those who deal with these things. I am mentally more alert, more receptive, and learning, which is always challenging, is faster.

Do you have any tips for learning more and getting started? I have searched a bit, but always appreciate anecdotes of those that have found success enough to speak about it.

My computer engineering professors also emphasized user centered design. For one of Google's top scientists to bring this up is an admission that they won't, or can't, design a good user experience for their tools.

reply

It always surprises and saddens me that, despite having been an excellent student throughout my years of education, I remember practically nothing about 90% of the subjects I studied.

reply

Same goes for user-centered design. Trying to make something user-friendly is one thing, successfully doing it is another. Large organizations are especially poor at user-friendly design because the underlying structures which support that goal don't exist. Organizational science is still in its infancy.

reply

Everything you see of its character, including emphasizing tests and practice, follows from that. Talking about good UX is miles away.

1. Have the kids learn new things
2. Have the kids reach a desired level of competencyLearning happens where you are at, not where the teacher wants you to be. Every student is at a different place in understanding. It's impossible without 1-on-1 instruction to really maximize learning.Competency is only determined via testing. Learning doesn't require testing at all, you can just speak to a student to get a good idea if they're making some progress, any progress. Competency? That basically demands a test, because it has a particular bar in mind.Now students know they need to pass the bar, somehow, but the anxiety of that is going to cause issues with them just trying to learn. This is unfixable though, because the outside pressures demand students have some level of competency otherwise teachers are viewed as failures.

If we're lucky, LLMs force people to put more effort into assignments and grading and then that would help kids learn to learn as well.

C36 programs describe sequences of discrete events in time. The environment includes a primitive sampler, as a self-contained means of interpreting these events as sound. For full expressivity, though, the system is best used as a generator of data for interpretation by an external musical instrument, such as a synthesizer.The project was very directly inspired by Orca (https://100r.co/site/orca.html).

He's a friend, but I am very unbiased in saying that the sample-rate execution of the entire grid seems like an incredible technical achievement.One of the craziest (super super noisy but fascinating to watch) grids uses just a few “operators” that generate random operators and random values, and place them at random location.That grid runs - easily! in the browser!! - at 1000 bpm. Forget 60 fps :)I'll update my comment linking to this patch so you can take a listen. It's stunning, organic and very punk.

Very briefly, I contributed the CI pipeline that makes git push build the wasm and deploy it to a micro server that sets the specific required headers. I used the deployment tool I've been working on with a friend, which is called Disco.There was something about wasm/the audio worklet requiring super specific headers - `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` … Nothing too complicated.The other part I contributed is the loading/saving patches to Firebase, which lets people share compositions.But all of the audio, grid, ui is all River's!

Hike, once one of India's most valuable startups with unicorn status, has become the latest casualty of New Delhi's recent real-money gaming ban, with the company — led by Kavin Bharti Mittal, son of Airtel founder Sunil Bharti Mittal — now shutting down.

On Saturday, Hike founder Mittal (pictured above) said that the startup's U.S. business, which launched nine months ago, was “off to a strong start.” But he said scaling it globally would require “a full recap, a reset that is not the best use of capital or time.”

Initially launched as an instant messaging app rivaling WhatsApp in 2012, Hike pivoted to real-money gaming in recent years, with its primary platform, Rush, offering casual games like carrom and ludo for cash prizes, following the shutdown of Hike Messenger in 2021. Rush attracted over 10 million users and generated more than $500 million in gross revenue over its four-year run, Mittal said.

Storied investors including Tiger Global, SoftBank, and Tencent backed Hike's early ambition to take on WhatsApp with a youth-focused messaging app. The startup was valued at $1.4 billion in 2016.

“We could raise the capital, but the real question is: is it worth it? Is this a climb worth pivoting for?” Mittal wrote in a Substack post. “For the first time in 13 years, my answer is no. Not for me, not for my team, and not for our investors.” 

Last month, the Indian government shocked the $23-billion real-money gaming industry by introducing the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025, which imposed a blanket ban on such platforms. The federal government said the decision was aimed at addressing incidents of harm, including cases where individuals reportedly died by suicide after losing money in these games.

In response, top industry players including Dream Sports and Mobile Premier League (MPL) began shutting down their real-money gaming operations in India. While some started pivoting to new ventures like micro-dramas and financial services, others began exploring international markets to keep parts of their gaming businesses alive.

The crackdown has also triggered a wave of layoffs, with around 2,000 job losses reported across companies like Games24x7, Head Digital Works, MPL, and Zupee. Some of them are planning to cut up to 90% of their workforce as they attempt to adapt or exit the space, sources told TechCrunch.

Some VC firms backing these startups have also questioned their founders on whether there had been any early signs of regulatory action — and if so, why no steps were taken to mitigate the impact, sources familiar with the conversations told TechCrunch.

Earlier this week, the Indian Supreme Court transferred all petitions challenging the new law — the rules of which are yet to be notified — from multiple state courts across the country. However, the top court has yet to begin hearing the matter.

“This is both a disappointment and a hard outcome. But I choose to look on the bright side: the learnings are invaluable, and my conviction for what's next is even stronger,” Mittal wrote.

Portable monitors have long occupied a niche market of small, lightweight displays that usually sacrifice features and performance on the altar of convenience. And rightly so, because if you loaded them up with tech and cred, they wouldn't be very portable. Still, it would be nice to have something of decent size to game on, maybe as a second screen for that giga-hauler gaming laptop weighing down your tech bag.

Asus attempts to fill that role with its ZenScreen MB27ACF. Most of the portables I've interacted with are 15 inches at best, but this one is 27 inches in size. However, it still weighs just 6.57 pounds and is 20mm thin. The panel is IPS with QHD 2560x1440 resolution, 100 Hz, FreeSync/VRR, and three internal speakers. It includes an integrated fold-out stand and a nice C-clamp arm for the desktop. Let's take a look.

The MB27ACF isn't strictly a gaming monitor; it gives you most of what's needed for decent play. The 100 Hz refresh rate is relatively low, but coupled with a decent overdrive, it delivers reasonably smooth motion processing with just moderate input lag. It includes Adaptive-Sync but only for FreeSync and VRR applications. It is not certified for G-Sync, and I was unable to use Nvidia's frame-tear-eliminating tech. However, it works fine with Radeon video cards and consoles.

The image comes from an IPS panel with QHD 2560x1440 resolution. That's 109ppi in pixel density speak, enough for a nice, sharp image at close viewing distances. I also found decent off-axis quality and good reflection rejection from the screen's matte finish. The color gamut is slightly larger than sRGB; I refer to it as sRGB+. I missed the greater volume offered by many gaming monitors, but in typical Asus fashion, it is accurate, and the MB27ACF makes the most of its capabilities. Calibration isn't required, but you can make a few tweaks for a slight improvement.

Ergonomically, the package is more complete than other portables I've encountered. There's no carrying case included, but you do get a metal fold-out stand with rubber feet to keep it from sliding around. The stand doubles as a handle. A snap-on fixture in the back interfaces with a high-quality arm terminated in a large C-clamp. You can quickly install it on any desk or tabletop up to around four inches thick. And it comes with brackets to hang it from a cubicle partition. Should you want an aftermarket solution, there's a 75mm VESA mount.

For power, you get a small external brick, or you can connect the MB27ACF via USB-C for a one-cable solution. The only limitation is an 85-nit brightness cap. A 3.5mm headphone jack provides audio, and there are three internal speakers, one of which is called a subwoofer. My idea of a subwoofer is around a thousand times the size and volume of a computer monitor, but in practice, the MB27ACF puts out more bass than other desktop displays with internal speakers, so it is a definite improvement over the norm.

Asus offers a solid package here for $449 at this writing. It sits in the middle between premium and budget pricing, but from what I've seen in this sparsely populated genre, the MB27ACF has no real competition.

The MB27ACF's diminutive box is brimming with accessories. The panel can be used without any extras, including the power supply, if you plug it into a PC or laptop equipped with USB-C. The fold-out stand has a large angle range and includes rubber feet in just the right spots to keep everything from sliding about. The arm ends in a large C-clamp with around four inches of range. A small snap-on adaptor interfaces with the arm's Z mount. Also included in the box are brackets for cubicle partitions, allowing you to hang the MB27ACF like a picture. HDMI and USB-C cables round out the parts bundle.

From the front, the MB27ACF is all screen with a 7mm bezel around the top and sides. The bottom trim says “Asus” and is capped underneath by a clear plastic strip that floats the panel about 12mm off the desktop. Like the fold-out stand, it is also rubberized for added stability.

The arm is super nice and could easily cost $100 on its own. It has a large clamp with rubber pads that protect your furniture from scratches. The panel snaps onto it using a small, round bracket, which is removable. The Z mount offers almost unlimited swivel plus fore and aft movement. The height adjustment is nearly seven inches and features a locking mechanism. The mount also includes a 90-degree portrait mode.

The inputs are on the left side and include one HDMI 2.0 and a USB-C with DisplayPort function. You also get a DC plug for the small external power brick. A 3.5mm jack provides headphone support. If you power the MB27ACF through USB-C, brightness is limited to 85 nits. On the opposite side are control keys for power and menu navigation.

Pressing one of the MB27ACF's side control keys opens a small menu with brightness, OSD, and power options. The user can change these shortcuts. The full OSD resembles a typical Asus menu, except that the background is white instead of black.

There are eight picture modes, and I was surprised to see no Racing mode. Standard is the default, and it is fairly close to standard, so calibration is optional. Next up is the blue light filter and color adjustments for different states of color blindness, called Color Augmentation. The Image menu has luminance sliders and a five-level overdrive called Trace Free. You can also toggle VRR here.

In the Color menu are five gamma presets and three fixed color temps plus a set of RGB sliders. You can achieve a very precise calibration if you wish. In My Favorite, you can program the shortcut keys that appear on the right side of the screen to the settings you use most often.

In case you were fuzzy on the MB27ACF's gaming intent, Asus has thrown in its complete GamePlus suite with six aiming points, timers, frame counter, stopwatch, and display alignment marks. I wish they'd thrown in G-Sync too, but users of consoles and Radeon cards will get Adaptive-Sync/VRR through the full 100 Hz refresh rate range.

From Asus' ProArt side comes QuickFit, which is a handy set of on-screen templates for different paper sizes. It's ideal for visualizing documents that you plan to print since they can be viewed at actual size.

The MB27ACF doesn't require calibration in its Standard picture mode, but I went for a grayscale adjustment anyway. The RGB sliders got me dialed in easily with a visible and measurable improvement. Gamma is spot-on whether you calibrate or not, and I was glad to see accurate presets included. Choices are always welcome. Unfortunately, HDR is not supported, so there's nothing to report in that regard. My SDR settings are below.

The MB27ACF impressed me unexpectedly with its gaming ability. I've said for years that 144 Hz is a starting point, and I'm not changing that mantra. But Asus makes excellent use of every Hertz with a superb overdrive that is precisely tuned. Locking the frame rate at 100fps in QHD resolution is easy work for many video cards so the lack of G-Sync for me wasn't an issue.

Motion blur wasn't invisible, but it didn't distract me from precise aiming. I could dispatch targets with very little wasted ammo. Input lag is low enough that I didn't perceive it. The MB27ACF is only 40 Hz quicker than an enterprise display but it feels like more than that. A 144 Hz monitor with less precise overdrive would not look this good.

Color and contrast were good but after enjoying HDR and wide gamut color on other monitors, the MB27ACF came up a tad short. Warm tones show better than cooler textures which were a bit flat. If you're trooping around a forest or jungle, the image has more impact than the icy cold environments of Doom Eternal's first horde map. For casual gaming on the go, there is little to complain about. And the draw of a 27-inch monitor cannot be ignored. Most portables are 15 or 16 inches. The MB27ACF's extra area more than makes up for the missing HDR and wide gamut.

From a usability standpoint, the MB27ACF shines. It's thin and light and slips easily into a tech pack or large briefcase. I would recommend using a bag or sleeve to protect the screen. That's one thing Asus left out. However, the fold-out stand is extremely well-engineered, with firm movement. The monitor feels very secure on it thanks to the rubberized bits. I also used the included arm, which clamps down in just a minute. Snapping the panel on creates a solid package with precise adjustment. The locking height movement is convenient. And the Z mount allows for nearly unlimited swivel.

The MB27ACF boasts its 2.1-channel sound with subwoofer, and indeed, I heard more bass than what comes from typical integrated speakers. The sound is a bit thin in the midrange, but upper frequencies were clear and precise. When playing on the go, you'll be using the headphone jack more often, and I appreciate its convenient location on the side.

Takeaway: The MB27ACF is a complete package, not just as a portable monitor, but also as a desktop display. Though it lacks HDR and wide gamut color, it games very well and comes with multiple mounting options that are well thought out. It's thin and light as a portable should be, but the build quality is rugged and befitting its price. It has no real competition at present.

Some people need a little bit more size on their laptops. Maybe you have eyesight that requires a larger screen, maybe you do something for work that means you need a big enough screen to work on, or maybe it's just your preference. No matter what your reasoning is, if you want a big laptop, we've got a great deal for you today.

Right now, you can get your hands on this HP 17-Inch Laptop at 74% off. The listed price for this is currently $3,600, which means it's currently on sale for $940, which is an amazing amount of money off. This is the lowest the price has been in the last 30 days, so you're getting a good deal.

See at Amazon

A 17-inch laptop is noticeably larger than many options out there. It means that you've got more screen space to work with when you're building reports, writing up an essay, or just enjoying a good TV show. It's just a little bit more comfortable for a large number of people, although it's worth noting that these laptops do tend to be heavier because they're larger, which might be an issue for some people who don't want the strain.

This laptop has a fair amount of power inside of it, which means it's good for a lot of people. The biggest appeal here, outside of the HD screen, is the sheer volume of memory it has. It packs in a massive 64GB of RAM, which means you'll be able to multitask so smoothly it'll feel like a dream, and a lot of programs will feel like they're loading just because you've started thinking about them.

Along with that, it comes with Windows 11 Pro installed, and it even comes with some accessories to help keep your laptop feeling that little bit fancier. This laptop is an absolutely excellent choice for working professionals and students who are doing something that requires a bit more power than standard laptops can manage.

While the price is normally very high, the sale price of $940 is a lot more reasonable. You're getting a big laptop with a huge amount of memory and processing speed, and that's going to do wonders no matter what you're using it for. If you do want to get it while it's at this price though, we do recommend being quick, because there's no telling when this reduction will end.

Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center — an organization responsible for discoveries that have fundamentally transformed cancer treatment and helped to establish the Seattle area as a biotech hub — is celebrating its founding 50 years ago this month.

Dr. Fred Appelbaum has been there since nearly day one.

Appelbaum, a Fred Hutch oncologist and executive vice president, recalls the early, scrappier days of the nonprofit as it was trying to turn Dr. Donnall Thomas' bold ideas about bone marrow transplants into viable treatments. The effort ultimately worked and Fred Hutch is now a 6,000-employee institution that draws on its origins to inspire the next generation of ambitious cancer research.

“That history of success tells us that we did it before, and we should be able to do it again,” Appelbaum told GeekWire. “That's embedded in the personality of the Hutch.”

The organization's discoveries have led to 50 spinoff companies including Juno Therapeutics, Adaptive Biotechnologies and Affini-T Therapeutics.

“The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center is a storied research institution that has been key to the progress for patients with cancer,” said Dr. Norman Sharpless, a past director of the National Cancer Institute and former acting commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, via email.

Added Dr. Robert Vonderheide, director of the Abramson Cancer Center at Penn Medicine, regarding Fred Hutch: “Its reputation and impact are so well-known and cherished that everyone in our field simply says ‘The Hutch.' We know what that means: Nobel-winning discovery and innovation, and science and treatments that make a difference for patients with cancer.”

But even as past accomplishments and recent breakthroughs are driving momentum, Fred Hutch faces daunting new challenges. The Trump administration is working to slash research dollars in an effort to boost government efficiency. Federal leaders have canceled grants and want to cap overhead funding that pays for utilities, rent and other so-called indirect costs.

Fred Hutch president and director Dr. Tom Lynch warned earlier this year that the administration's cuts to overhead support “would have a chilling, dramatic, horrific effect on our ability to do research.”

Appelbaum struck a tone of resiliency this month, noting that Fred Hutch has survived three recessions and significant funding cuts — and the founding years themselves were a test of the researchers' mettle.

In 1990, Thomas won a Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on bone marrow transplants, but the initial experiments were often harrowing for the doctors, nurses and leukemia patients alike. Only very sick patients with limited alternatives enrolled in the studies, which included radiation treatments delivered in underground bunkers from World War II. Cure rates were around 15%, Appelbaum previously recounted.

“[T]ime and again you'd have patients come in with hopes that they could be saved, and their family hoped that they could be saved, and unfortunately the toxicity of the transplant caused them to die or the disease came back,” he said in a 2015 interview. 

But as the therapy was fine-tuned, outcomes improved and the patients beat their cancer. 

“That was incredibly exhilarating,” Appelbaum said. “They'd been brought back literally from the jaws of death.”

From there, the researchers made additional discoveries, realizing that bone marrow transplants could treat certain genetic ailments, such as sickle cell disease. Fred Hutch studies helped spur CAR-T cell treatments by demonstrating the ability to genetically manipulate immune cells and create receptors that recognize malignant cancers.

“This whole revolution in gene therapy,” said Appelbaum, was derived from Thomas' initial observations in marrow transplantation.

Over the decades, the center has gone from treating a 100 patients annually to serving 50,000 patients this year for wide-ranging cancers.

Fred Hutch scientists and clinicians have made essential discoveries “in diverse topics from tumor immunology to cancer virology to bone marrow transplantation,” said Sharpless, who is now professor of Cancer Policy and Innovation at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. 

“It would not be an exaggeration,” he added, “to say that many thousands of people who were once diagnosed with cancer are alive today because of critical discoveries at the FHCC.”

As cancer care has evolved the nature of the work has likewise progressed, Appelbaum said. That includes a variety of changes:  

With these gains, is the moonshot of curing cancer getting closer? 

“We are curing lots of cancers.” Appelbaum said, while acknowledging that some, such as pancreatic cancer and glioblastomas, remain difficult to treat.  

“But that doesn't mean that they are insurmountable,” he said. When it comes to those diseases, he added, “I firmly believe that we will, over the next decade, continue to unravel all the reasons why our current therapies, which should work, don't work.”

The question now is how the work will be funded. Fred Hutch received $305 million of National Institutes of Health funding last year — second only to the University of Washington among NIH recipients in the state.

But the Trump administration has proposed capping indirect cost payments at 15%, far below Fred Hutch's current 76% rate. That change would wipe out roughly $125 million in annual support for the center, whose operating budget was $2.1 billion last year.

Appelbaum acknowledged that U.S. research institutions could make fiscal improvements, but the nonprofit is worried. While the cuts are being fought in court and Congress is still weighing in, impacts are already being felt. 

Hiring is being delayed and the organization is investing time and energy exploring different potential outcomes, Appelbaum said. The center has made layoffs, but declined to confirm how many.

“We're very, very, very concerned, but we don't know right now what is going to happen,” he added.

Fred Hutch also has support from philanthropic giving, which includes $710 million from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his family that's being issued over a decade, and a gift from Stuart and Molly Sloan, owners of University Village, that was recently increased to $100 million.

Despite funding uncertainties, Appelbaum still can imagine how cancer care hits its moonshot. He envisions people coming in for their annual physical, having a painless blood sample taken, and providers looking for any hints of cancer.

If something is detected, “we'll remove that early tumor, and we'll vaccinate you,” he said. “The tumor will never come back. That's how we'll cure cancer.”

Whichever you choose, the combined CPU and GPU cooling capacity is claimed to be 250W.

There's a compact new fanless chassis on the block, dubbed the FanlessVC2300S DT (machine translation). Listed on China's Taobao online market (h/t FanlessTech), what makes this particular design remarkable is that an all-copper edition is being made available, limited to 10 units. It is going to be extremely tricky to snag one of those, we expect. Still, the aluminum-clad version in the image appears to have the same total passive cooling capacity of 250W.

The physical presence of the FanlessVC2300S DT is certainly its raison d'être, so let's consider this aspect of the design first. Whether you opt for the majority copper or aluminum shrouded version, you will receive a 360 x 303 x 130mm case with an interior volume of 14.2 liters and an essentially copper passive cooling system inside. The limited-edition copper-encased version weighs in at a hefty 21.5kg (47.4 pounds), according to the specifications, while the aluminum alloy model is approximately half the mass at 11.2 kg (24.7 pounds).

As per the headline, this is an ITX form factor chassis. Thus, you can equip your own choice of 170 x 170mm ITX motherboard in this quick-release system case. On the topic of max compatibility, there is room for a Flex ATX PSU, with a Platinum-rated model recommended. You will also have room for a pair of memory modules with a maximum height of 44mm, and a single 2.5-inch storage device.

Moving on to the technical details, according to the chassis maker, you can fit a CPU and GPU, adding up to a TDP of as much as 250W. A half-height Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 is reportedly the most powerful option that works in this machine. That will likely contribute approximately 145W or less to the thermal budget. So, you'll have 105W cooling capacity left for your CPU if you want to push your luck.

However, we can't be sure whether you can split that total 250W TDP budget however you like between the CPU and GPU. That's because, upon reading through the (machine-translated) specs, it appears that two separate thermal solutions are addressing these hot components. The blurb suggests that there are “a total of seventeen 8mm heat pipes to provide heat conduction for the CPU.” Meanwhile, the GPU is cooled by a trio of vapor chambers linked to a 10mm heat pipe. Both parts are also connected to the “four-sided heat dissipation structure,” which is hewn from copper fins, providing an effective 1.3 m² heat dissipation area, according to the case maker.

On the Taobao retail page, we see that the aluminum shell version of this case is priced at 1,760 Chinese Yuan (~$250) for an introductory period, rising to 2,000 Yuan (~$280) upon general availability. Also, you'd need to hire an agent or use some other jiggery-pokery to purchase it for delivery outside of China.

We couldn't find any price/availability details for the limited-edition all-copper version.

Around 35 million years ago, a small asteroid traveling at 40,000 miles per hour (64,373 kilometers per hour) struck Earth, crashing into the Atlantic Ocean near the modern-day town of Cape Charles, Virginia. The approximately 3-mile-wide (5-kilometer) object created a large impact crater that's buried half a mile beneath Chesapeake Bay. Hundreds of miles south of the crater, scientists have found new evidence of the asteroid impact and the tsunami that followed the shattering event.

Hidden beneath the waters of the Chesapeake, the impact crater in Virginia is among the largest and most preserved craters found on Earth. The Chesapeake Bay crater was first discovered in 1990, and scientists are still trying to piece together the trail of destruction left by the asteroid. A team of geologists investigating fossils in Moore County, North Carolina, uncovered layers of rock they determined were forged by the asteroid impact and the tsunami that followed.

In a recently published study in Southeastern Geology, scientists document the far-reaching impact of the asteroid collision, detailing the discovery of a site found approximately 240 miles (386 km) away from the Virginia crater in the Sandhills of North Carolina.

The team of geologists behind the new study found four distinct beds of rock within a one-yard-thick layer formation at the site in Moore County. The first bed of rock is around 17 inches thick (43 centimeters) and contains sandy clay rich in carbon glass and rock fragments. The researchers also measured 14 to 18 parts per billion of iridium, a rare chemical element that's often found in meteorites that land on Earth.

The second bed of rock, measuring at only about 3 inches thick (9 centimeters), contained silt and loosely bound masses of quartz and carbon, as well as 2 to 6 parts per billion of iridium. Bed number 3 is a mix of soil and seafloor fragments and measures at around 2 inches thick (6 centimeters), while the fourth bed of rock is around 6 inches (15 centimeters) of coarse sand that may have been deposited by a tsunami.

The geological makeup of the different rock beds made no sense when examined on its own, but the researchers behind the study traced it to the ancient asteroid that struck Virginia millions of years ago.

Around 35 million years ago, when the asteroid struck Earth, the impact created a hypersonic shock wave that destroyed plants and animals for hundreds of miles in each direction and rained huge amounts of molten debris in the area that stretches from Massachusetts to Barbados.

When it was first discovered, scientists speculated that the impact that hit the Atlantic Ocean also likely caused a massive, far-reaching tsunami, but they had not found actual remains of it. The new study suggests that the strange rock formation in North Carolina traces all the way back to that fateful day when the asteroid struck Earth millions of years ago.

The first rock bed records the initial impact, rich with ejecta and carbon-rich debris that had settled into the channel within the first minutes. Rock bed number two is an accumulation of the finer particles that were ejected as the plume thinned, while the third rock bed is a record of the inland surge of seawater and sediment. Finally, the fourth rock bed is when water refilled the channel with clean sand and gravel.

The new finding adds further clarity to the Chesapeake Bay impact and how far-reaching it really was. As we're learning, this lone asteroid, through this single cataclysmic encounter, reshaped an entire region so many million years ago.

At one time, having a 4K monitor felt like a luxury. Now, thanks to the power of modern computers and the dramatic price drop, 4K monitors are no longer unattainable upgrades. They're becoming the standard.

The Dell 27 Plus 4K is the best example of this trend I've seen so far. It might not have all the bells and whistles of a Dell UltraSharp monitor, nor the mind-blowing image quality of the Dell 32 Plus OLED. But for my money, this is the best monitor the average person working from home should buy—especially when it's on discount. I've seen it dip as low as $254, and that's a steal for what you get.

Dell monitors have always been pretty, and the Dell 27 Plus 4K is no different. The bezels are thin, and the base and stand aren't overly large. The “Ash White” color looks clean on my already-white desk. It might not look as professional as a silver or black model, but for home use, I prefer the white. The design is worth noting, too, since at this price, some monitors tend to look really cheap. Despite the plastic exterior on the Dell 27 Plus 4K, the stand and base have metal inside, so they feel sturdy.

Setting up this monitor is simple, with no tools required. Compared to most monitors, it does have an extra backplate that must be tightened into the stand (with a thumb screw), but it only takes a minute or so to pull the various pieces out of the box and have it ready to go.

The back of the monitor has a standard VESA mount, making it perfect for connecting to a monitor arm if that's your jam. The stand gives you a full range of adjustments, including 5 inches of height, tilt, rotation, and swivel. Unfortunately, it doesn't go high enough to rotate it completely into a vertical monitor, which is a shame. (You can still use it vertically with a monitor arm.)

The one truly old-school thing about the Dell 27 Plus 4K is the port selection. All you've got is two HDMI 2.1 ports and a DisplayPort 1.4 port. That's it. No USB-C for single-cable connections. No headphone jack. No upstream USB ports. The lack of USB-C is annoying, as so many laptops these days ship without HDMI. If you have a MacBook Air, Dell XPS 13, Surface Laptop, or countless other laptops with limited ports, you'll be stuck using a USB hub or docking station to get them connected to this monitor. That's not the end of the world, but it's one of the missing features that keeps this specific model from perfection.

The lack of USB means you'll need to plug things like extra storage, your mouse, keyboard, or other accessories directly into your laptop or into a dock. Clearly, this is an area in which Dell compromised to get the price down. Fortunately, Dell sells the same monitor with an integrated USB-C hub, the S2725QC model, for just $50 more. That's well worth the money. If you'd rather have those ports over the resolution, Dell even sells a QHD (2K) model (2,560 x 1,440) for $245 with a built-in USB-C hub. This model's refresh rate is only 75 Hz instead of 120 Hz, though.

A lot of people, especially on a desktop PC, may not need those extra ports anyway, so I like that Dell offers the option and doesn't charge outrageous prices to upgrade. You'll pay more than $100 for it, but it's one area where the Samsung 27" ViewFinity S8 has an advantage, with USB-C connectivity and more. It even comes with a KVM switch to sweeten the deal. I haven't tested that monitor myself yet, but it's on my list for that reason alone.

The Dell 27 Plus has a 3,840 x 2,160 resolution, otherwise known as 4K or UHD. This is a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is standard, and at this size, the resolution is incredibly sharp. You definitely can't pick out pixels. It's an IPS (in-plane switching) panel, which is also standard for a work monitor of this type.

IPS won't have the deep blacks and HDR capability of OLED (or Mini-LED), or even the improved contrast in newer IPS Black panels, like the Dell UltraSharp 32 4K U3225Q. However, the monitor goes up to 355 nits and has a contrast of 1,270:1, according to my own measurements. The colors surprised me as well. It covers 100 percent of the sRGB color space and 79 percent of AdobeRGB. With quite good color accuracy as well (an average color accuracy of 1.16), it's even a decent option for content creators looking for an affordable display to match with a MacBook Pro.

The Dell 27 Plus 4K does have a matte coating, which I don't prefer. It's still fairly unusual to find glossy panels, outside of OLED monitors or the Apple Studio Display (9/10, WIRED Recommends), which is 40 percent brighter than this monitor. I'll always take the crystal-clear look of a glossy display, even if it means having to deal with glare from time to time. The matte finish isn't too noticeable, but it does make the display feel slightly dimmer and less vibrant. The good news is that it does a good job of resisting reflections and glare.

Thanks to the 120-Hz refresh rate and AMD FreeSync Premium, the Dell 27 Plus 4K is even a decent little gaming monitor when you need it to be. No, it's not going to compete with a dedicated gaming monitor, especially one that is QHD with a 240-Hz refresh rate, for example. But if you need 4K for work, the Dell 27 Plus 4K functions well as a hybrid gaming-and-work monitor. I happily tried a few different games, including Cyberpunk 2077, Marvel Rivals, and Star Wars Outlaws. The high resolution is better-suited for slower, single-player experiences, but you can pull it down to lower resolutions and enjoy some faster-paced games with the 120-Hz refresh rate.

That higher refresh rate isn't just for gaming, though. Dell has been among the first to introduce 120-Hz refresh rates across the board in its mainstream consumer monitors. It makes for a much smoother experience in nearly everything you do, from scrolling a webpage to even just moving the cursor. Trust me, once you go to 120 Hz, you won't want to go back to 60 Hz. It goes a long way toward making even this affordable monitor feel premium.

I let the pair of integrated 5-watt speakers ring out, and again, I found myself surprised. For internal monitor speakers, I found myself enjoying the experience. There's some bass that can be heard, and overall, I've heard far worse. The speakers really do elevate the gaming experience, and I even found myself listening to music casually with them. (You should probably still snag some computer speakers.)

There are areas where the Dell 27 Plus 4K feels bare-bones, especially the ports. And there are other areas where it goes above and beyond, such as in the refresh rate and speakers. But this all has to be considered within the context of this monitor's price. There aren't many other name-brand 27-inch 4K monitors out there for less than $300. The closest thing Lenovo and HP have is at least hundreds of dollars more. LG and Samsung come close with their options, but their 4K 27-inch monitors only have a 60-Hz refresh rate.

If the port situation is a problem for you, which I can fully understand, I'd recommend checking out the S2725QC model. But if you've been working from home on a crusty old 1080p monitor for too long, the Dell 27 Plus 4K is the 4K upgrade you've been waiting for.

Dust and grime doesn't take the shine off this system, which also came with an AiO cooler, 16GB RAM, and a 500GB SSD.

A Redditor thanked his father for gifting him something that he plucked out of the trash. Alternative-Run363 claims that his dad enjoyed a big ‘W' by fishing out a PC packing an Intel Core i5-9400F, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660, and more. That's a ‘W' indeed, since it all seems to work, and Windows 11 is installed and activated. It's certainly better than the kipper bones, tin cans, or old boots that Thomas Jasper Cat Sr. usually found in the trash.

In this latest case of finding computer treasure in the trash, we don't get much of a backstory regarding the find. However, it certainly looks like the PC system in the picture has seen better days. You can clearly see dust and grime has built up in this machine over the years. From the single picture, it is difficult to determine if there are dust filters missing or if they were just unmaintained. According to the social media posting, there's a glass side panel that was removed for the photo.

So, let's take a closer look at what Alternative-Run363 managed to snag for the grand total of zero dollars and zero cents:

In summary, we have here a mid-range gaming PC that was probably put together between 2018 and 2020. As it stands, it should perform respectably at 1080p in PC titles of that era (and older), and it will also be fine for daily office and web-based activities. We'd still recommend a thorough de-dusting of the system and would be tempted to throw in a fresh PSU (we can't see any condition indicators for the existing top-mounted unit).

Depending on Alternative-Run363's intended purpose for this system, the platform could be upgraded to a higher-tier 9th Gen Intel Core processor. Right now, the system packs a modest hexa-core CPU without hyperthreading. The B360 board could be upgraded with a Core i9-9900 to deliver 8 cores and 16 threads of processing, for example.

Meanwhile, there are oodles of GPU upgrades possible thanks to the enduring PCIe standard. But in the context of this system, and its PCIe 3.0 x16 slot, you would probably look for bargains from the old Nvidia RTX20 or AMD RX5000 series.

We note that the freshly unleashed Borderlands 4 official system requirements mention an Intel Core i7-9700 and RTX 2070 / RX 5700 XT in its minimum specifications column. So, in theory, this trash find could be dragged up to a level to enjoy the newest episode of this looter shooter. Don't blame us if Borderlands 4 runs horribly, though; that seems to be a trend.

Google has accidentally leaked its new Nest security cameras and video doorbell line. Setup options appeared in the Google Home app for wired versions of the Nest Cam Indoor (3rd gen), Nest Cam Outdoor (2nd gen), and Nest Doorbell (3rd gen), as reported by Android Authority. The options now appear to have been removed, but an eagle-eyed Redditor also found the new products locked up at Home Depot, ready to go on sale.

Google has already confirmed that it plans to unveil new information about the infusion of its Gemini voice assistant into Google Home on October 1, replacing Google Assistant. That's likely when we'll see the new hardware, too. These overdue updates are rumored to include a resolution bump to 2K, a new zoom and crop feature, fresh colors, and a switch to Gemini for Home. There's also talk of a new subscription option as Nest Aware turns into Google Home Premium, and a new Google Home Premium Advanced plan. Details haven't been confirmed, so take all of this with a pinch of salt.

As for the design of the new lineup, they look almost identical to the existing range, aside from the colors, which include an eye-catching red. Perhaps in preparation for the new releases, the Nest team recently updated the Home app to provide preview images from the last event before the live view loads, swiping between timeline and events, and better notifications with a static thumbnail expandable to a large animated preview. There was also a raft of performance improvements and some much-needed polish. —Simon Hill

Sony stopped selling its flagship Xperia phones in the US last year, and that seems to be continuing with the latest midrange Xperia 10 VII, announced on Friday. It'll launch in Asia, Europe, and the UK, and it debuts a fresh design language with a horizontal camera bar, much like Google's Pixel phones (and even the iPhone Air).

It has a 6.1-inch screen, which may sound nice and compact, but it's slightly bigger than the 6.1-inch iPhone 16. That's probably because the bezels at the top and bottom of the screen are a little chunky for a modern phone. Still, you get a 120-Hz refresh rate, and some folks will be excited to see the 3.5-mm headphone jack and microSD card slot. It's powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chip with a 5,000-mAh battery in tow, and no wireless charging.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

As for the cameras, Sony has a 50-megapixel main camera paired with a 13-MP ultrawide, and you can use the dedicated shutter button on the side to snap pics. It'll cost £399 or €449 in the UK and Europe and goes on sale September 19, the same day as the latest iPhone 17 lineup.

This week, Qualcomm announced the next evolution of its fast-charging technology, known as Quick Charge 5+. Qualcomm calls it its “fastest and most versatile charging solution,” which can recharge phones from 0 to 50 percent in five minutes. That was true of the original version of Quick Charge 5, though, which is now more than 5 years old. The advances in Quick Charge 5+ revolve around “advanced thermal control” and “intelligent power delivery” to the standard. It's less about increasing charging speed and more about maintaining that speed sustainably.

For example, Quick Charge 5+ doesn't just flow all that juice to the device uninhibited; instead, it “dynamically” regulates that power using a “reduced-voltage approach.” This means it can lower the voltage on the fly to prevent overheating while charging, without impacting performance or battery health.

Qualcomm says its fast-charging technology powers over 1 billion devices, but we'll have to see if Quick Charge 5+ picks up more mainstream adoption in phones and accessories in the US. Qualcomm's annual Snapdragon Summit is coming up on September 23, and the company says devices announced at the conference will support Quick Charge 5+. —Luke Larsen

Smart-lock brand Ultraloq is adept at adding support for the latest smart-home standards into its devices, from Matter to HomeKit. Now, Android users can share a similar experience to Apple Home Key users with an update to its Bolt NFC smart lock ($200), allowing it to work with NFC-enabled Android devices for a tap-to-unlock feature, much like how you tap to pay. It's a feature often touted for iPhones, and usually, you can't switch between ecosystems when a device is compatible with both. The Bolt NFC lock will allow for both Apple and Android devices to wirelessly unlock this smart lock with a tap.

The Android tap-to-unlock feature will work with both the Apple Key version of the lock and the slightly cheaper non-Apple Key version, but only the Apple Key version of the lock will have a true tap-to-unlock experience with no background app or other steps. The cheaper lock will require you to install the company's U Home app to run in the background. Choosing the Apple Key version of Ultraloq's Bolt NFC also allows you to use both Apple and Android devices to instantly unlock the door, so you won't have to choose a single ecosystem if you and your partner each have a different phone of choice. The lock also works with NFC cards and Ultraloq's key fobs. The free update is available through Ultraloq's U home app for anyone who already owns the Bolt NFC. —Nena Farrell

Smokeless firepits are mostly firepits, but with an extra layer of combustion that reduces the resulting smoke considerably. But smokeless firepits still involve, essentially, building a campfire inside a steel canister. The maker of WIRED's favorite smokeless firepit, the Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0, has launched an innovation this week designed to make this process easier for the intimidated. No tinder needed.

Unlike other firepits on the market, Solo Stove's new Summit Fire Pit includes a patent-pending “Quick-Strike Cone” on its bottom that looks a little like the cinder cone in a volcanic crater. Drop some logs into the pit around the metallic cone. Then pour some fire-starting gel on the top of the cone, which has ramps to funnel the gel into reservoirs on the firepit's base. Light the gel, and the gel will light the logs. Theoretically, the goal is to make lighting a firepit about as easy as lighting a can of Sterno.

The napalm-like flow of fire gel in Solo's marketing video is entrancing, I'll admit. Solo promises that the Summit will create the “most advanced, most beautiful” flame of any Solo firepit, largely because of more intense flames and shorter firepit walls. This smokeless flame show can be yours for $600, around $50 more than the most similar model of Solo Stove firepit without a cinder cone. —Matthew Korfhage

I have been a staunch advocate of xMEMS' solid-state headphone driver technology ever since I first laid ears on it in a pair of wireless earbuds a few years ago. The drivers don't act like typical pistons or moving coils in speakers, instead using silicon diaphragms and the piezoelectric effect to provide near lightning-fast response. This means perfect phase and excellent detail in your music, and it also means that the drivers are virtually bulletproof.

The main issue with xMEMS drivers has been that they aren't great down low. That's now been solved with a new full-range driver the brand calls the Cypress. Where previous xMEMS-equipped headphones needed a dynamic driver to handle the low end, thus somewhat defeating the purpose of their indestructibility, this new Cypress model offers 40 times the bass response and can go as low as 20 Hz. This brings listeners one step closer to the washing-machine-ready earbuds we've always wanted, though no brands have announced a pair using these new drivers yet. Mass production shipments are expected in 2026. —Parker Hall

Nikon announced its first cinema camera this week, the Nikon ZR. It's aimed at videographers and features some tech from Red, maker of high-end cinema cameras. (Nikon acquired Red last year.) The ZR is not a huge Red camera, though. The body is compact, so much so that it lacks a viewfinder. Instead, the ZR uses a huge 4-inch display that takes up most of the back of the camera. It's in a movie-friendly 16:10 aspect ratio and supports the P3 color gamut.

Inside, the ZR uses the same 24.5-MP partially stacked sensor we saw in the Nikon Z6 III last year. That means video recording up to 6K at 60 frames per second, but the ZR also offers a new RAW video codec called R3D NE1, based on RED's popular R3D RAW codec. It's not the same, but it uses the same Log curve and color gamut, so you can use any LUT file and the results should look the same as what you get from the Red (at least in color terms).

Other nice cinema-friendly features in the ZR include support for 32-bit float audio from built-in and external mics, 7.5 stops of built-in image stabilization (IBIS), which is nice because the ZR can take advantage of the wide Z mount to support all kinds of third-party cinema lenses via adapters. The ZR goes on sale on October 20 for $2,199, which is $500 cheaper than the Z6 III. You can preorder it at Amazon, B&H Photo, or Adorama.

It may have taken 8 years of teasing and the arrival of many more features ahead of it, but high-resolution music on Spotify Premium is finally here. Spotify's VP of Subscriptions acknowledged the long road it's taken to get here, admitting it had “taken time to build this feature in a way that prioritizes quality, ease of use, and clarity at every step.”

Spotify says that tracks can be streamed at “up to” 24-bit/44.1 kHz, with listeners able to choose between Low, Normal, High, Very High, and now Lossless quality, customizable across Wi-Fi, cellular, and downloads. Listeners will know when lossless is playing as an indicator will appear in the Now Playing view, or bar.

Premium subscribers will be notified when lossless is available to them, with the feature rolling out gradually to more than 50 markets through September and October. Users in the US have already started to get access, but will need to enable it manually on each device they listen with. To do that, tap your profile icon on the top left of the app, go to Settings & Privacy, then Media Quality, and toggle it on. —Verity Burns

Police in Utah have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with Wednesday's shooting death of MAGA influencer Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, according to a press conference held Friday by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox and FBI Director Kash Patel.

Robinson allegedly confessed to a family member that he had been the shooter, and a family friend called the police before he was arrested in the early morning hours of Friday.

“Tyler Robinson reached out to a family friend who contacted the Washington County Sheriff's Office with information that Robinson had confessed to them or implied that he had committed the incident,” Cox said during the press conference.

Kirk's death was captured from several angles and posted to social media platforms like X, TikTok, and Instagram. Many of the videos were very graphic and bloody, sparking a discussion about what kind of violence should be permitted on some of the internet's largest platforms.

Many social media users ran wild with speculation about who may have been behind the killing, with several allies of Kirk insisting the person must have been trans or a far-left radical. But Robinson isn't trans, and his exact politics are unclear at this point.

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that markings on the bullet casings found at the scene were in some way “expressing transgender and anti-fascist ideology,” citing a bulletin from the ATF. But the newspaper edited its article late Thursday to hedge on that claim, noting that experts urged caution in drawing conclusions from early internal reports.

What do the bullet casings actually say? Images of the casings haven't been released, but Gov. Cox read out loud what he said were the messages at the press conference on Friday. The capitalization of each word is unknown.

Fired casing:

Unfired casings:

Officials said the inscriptions had been “engraved on casings,” but didn't explain whether they were hand-etched or relied on some kind of technology.

The message on the fired casing, “Notices bulges OWO what's this?” is a meme that dates to at least 2013, according to Know Your Meme, and was used to mock furry romantic roleplay. The “OWO” is an emoticon that's meant to resemble someone dressed as an animal while looking seductive. There's no evidence that's emerged showing Robinson was associated with furries, and the meme has spread over the years to be included in many different contexts.

The directional arrows “up, right, down down down,” likely refer to the video game Helldivers 2, where pressing that sequence of buttons brings Hellfire missiles down on the target.

The subreddits for Helldivers and Helldivers 2 include a lot of discussion about the shooting right now, including someone who wrote, “Damn. Not for nothing, but it's gonna be weird to have one of these tattoos.” The tattoo shows the “up, right, down down down” sequence.

Damn. Not for nothing, but it's gonna be weird to have one of these tattoos byu/ChildhoodSea7062 inhelldivers2



The Helldivers subreddit has been locked temporarily by moderators. “Due to recent events and the high amount of posts about the topic, we will be locking the subreddit temporarily. We're aware of what happened, our modteam doesn't condone it,” a message on the subreddit reads.

“Bella Ciao” is an old anti-fascist song dedicated to anti-Nazi resistance fighters in Italy during World War II.

The casing that reads “If you read this you are gay LMAO” is likely a reference to a broad category of juvenile and homophobic jokes that are popular online. One version includes six tests for color-blindness. The meme reads “If you can't see these numbers, you are/have:” and includes six circles that read things like “depressed,” and “autistic,” among others. The circle for “gay” is not a real colorblind test, implying that the reader is homosexual.

Other versions of this meme have more recently appeared on TikTok and Instagram, where people claim they've written a song or are speaking words that “only straight people can hear.” The videos don't actually have any sound and again imply that the person watching the video is gay.

Social media users continue to pick apart unverified information gleaned from the social media accounts of the alleged shooter's family. But it's still too early to definitively say what Robinson believed.

Groypers, the term for far-right and white nationalist social media users who are terminally online and follow white supremacist Nick Fuentes, seemed uneasy in their discussions on 4Chan Friday, with some seeing overlap in the etched messages and typical Groyper humor.

Fuentes himself wrote in the aftermath of Kirk's shooting that it was “one of the most horrific things I've ever seen,” and asked people to pray for the influencer. “The violence and hatred has to stop. Our country needs Christ now more than ever,” Fuentes tweeted.

But other MAGA fans seemed less convinced that Robinson had Groyper sympathies. Tim Pool only highlighted the “hey fascist” bullet casing in a tweet on Friday, leaving out the casing that included a gay joke.

President Donald Trump appeared on Fox & Friends before the FBI press conference on Friday, rejecting the idea that the “radical right” was a problem.

“I'll tell you something that's going to get me in trouble, but I couldn't care less,” Trump said about right-wing radicals. “The radicals on the right oftentimes are radical because they don't want to see crime. They don't want to see crime.”

“They're saying, we don't want these people coming in,” Trump said, presumably referring to immigrants. “We don't want you burning our shopping centers. We don't want you shooting our people in the middle of the street. The radicals on the left are the problem, and they're vicious, and they're horrible, and they're politically savvy.”

EARHARDT: We have radicals on the right as well. How do we fix this country?

TRUMP: I'll tell you something that's gonna get me in trouble but I couldn't care less. The radicals on the right oftentimes are radical because they don't want to see crime. The radicals on the left are the problem.

Far-right commentator Matt Walsh also still insisted Friday that the alleged shooter was a “leftist militant.”

“There is now no doubt (as if there was any doubt) that this was a targeted political assassination by a leftist militant who had been radicalized by left wing propaganda,” wrote Walsh. “Political violence is nearly exclusively a left wing problem. It is a tool of their trade.”

Robinson was arrested on aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily harm, and obstruction of justice, according to court documents seen by the New York Times.

Kash Patel addressed Kirk during the press conference, saying, “To my friend Charlie Kirk, rest now brother. We have the watch. And I'll see you in Valhalla.”

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

Artificial intelligence and other technological trends are smoothing the way for commercial space ventures ranging from multibillion-dollar companies to a new wave of startups.

It probably comes as no surprise that Blue Origin, the space company created by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is taking advantage of AI. “You can imagine this is a favorite area of our founder,” said Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin's vice president of New Glenn strategy and business operations. “So, just generally, we are using it across the board.”

But other AI-fueled applications might raise an eyebrow. For example, Rebel Space is helping satellite companies generate synthetic data that could point to a potential valve failure long before the spacecraft is launched.

“The AI you trained would see it, and you would prevent a massive mission failure in the future,” said Carrie Marshall, the startup's co-founder and CEO.

Cornell, Marshall and other executives reflected on the trends accelerating the space industry this week during the Seattle Space Superiority Summit, presented on Thursday by FUSE VC at the Museum of Flight. AI figures in several of those trends. Here's a breakdown:

There's a rising tide of interest in orbital transfer vehicles for a variety of applications, including satellite servicing and multi-satellite deployment. But capabilities that address national security concerns — for example, maneuvering a satellite out of harm's way or challenging a threatening spacecraft — are among the biggest drivers behind that interest.

“There is a need to move over long ranges quickly in space that did not exist when space was not being considered a contested domain,” said Ian Vorbach, co-founder and chief operating officer of Bothell, Wash.-based Portal Space Systems. Portal's Supernova space mobility platform is designed to address that need, with Pentagon backing.

Other companies working on in-space mobility include Blue Origin and Tukwila, Wash.-based Starfish Space. Blue Origin's Blue Ring platform is due to fly its first mission next year, with an AI-enabled sensor built by Scout Space for the Space Force as the first announced payload. Meanwhile, Starfish Space is testing its second Otter Pup prototype in orbit, in preparation for a full-scale demonstration mission that could take place next year with Space Force funding.

The Trump administration's plans for a missile defense system known as Golden Dome are likely to lead to more contracts for commercial space ventures, potentially focusing on in-space sensing and data processing.

“There are certain cases where the latency of sending stuff down, making a decision and going back out is probably not a very healthy or a very safe thing to have,” said Gareth Keane, a partner at the IQT venture capital firm (a.k.a. In-Q-Tel), which focuses on national security applications. “These are particularly in areas like the 200-plus billion dollars that we're going to spend on Golden Dome.”

In-space data processing will be valuable in fields that go far beyond national security. Nathan Stein, co-founder and founding scientist at Matter Intelligence, said it's crucial for his company to winnow through the geospatial data that's collected by his company's space sensors while that data is still on the spacecraft.

“Instead of having to downlink hundreds of gigabytes of data for a single collect, can we produce Level 3 analytics products and directly downlink those, saving both cost and time?” he said. “For us, there's just a direct correlation between how many images we collect and how much revenue you get.”

Another potential application involves shifting data centers from terrestrial locations to orbital spots where those power-intensive facilities can draw upon space-based solar power. Redmond, Wash.-based Starcloud is planning to test the concept with NVIDIA computer chips during a demonstration mission that's due for launch as early as November.

Lots of space startups are looking forward to the ascendancy of SpaceX's Starship super-rocket, which is currently under development and should be capable of sending more than 100 tons of payload into low Earth orbit. Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket, which had its first launch in January and can put 45 tons of payload in orbit, will be a big contributor as well.

“In terms of competing with terrestrial data centers on energy costs, we are dependent on the launch cost coming down at least one order of magnitude,” Starcloud CEO Philip Johnston said. “When Starship or New Glenn or other launch vehicles come online, then we're in a position to be able to move.”

Mike DeRosa, co-founder and chief marketing officer for Marysville, Wash.-based Gravitics, said he felt the same way about the prospects for getting its space station modules into orbit. “I'm so excited about the new vehicles that are coming online, and Stoke and [Rocket Lab's] Neutron and New Glenn,” he said. “We're in that fun place where we don't want to leap forward, but we're also like, ‘Oh, let's get to next year when we can actually book a Starship launch.'”

There are also reports that SpaceX is working on a project known as Starfall, which would use Starship as a platform for in-space drug research and product development. That would represent yet another product line for SpaceX, which has already branched out from the rocket business with its Starlink satellite broadband network. 

Andy Lapsa, co-founder and CEO of Kent, Wash.-based Stoke Space, said he's not worried that Starship's rise will hurt his own startup. “I'm excited about Starship,” he said. “I think a successful Starship helps this entire industry move forward. And I think it's not a zero-sum game. At this point in the industry, a rising tide raises all ships.”

NASA's Artemis moon program is a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Blue Origin and other commercial space ventures. In 2023, a team led by Bezos' space venture won a $3.4 billion contract from NASA to build a lunar landing system for crewed moon missions beginning as early as 2029. An uncrewed demonstration mission, involving Blue Origin's Blue Moon Mark 1 lander, is said to be scheduled for next year.

Blue Origin is also working on a project called Blue Alchemist, which aims to extract materials from moon dirt and turn them into solar cells, construction materials and oxygen for lunar settlements. This week, Blue Origin said that the Blue Alchemist system successfully completed its critical design review.

Another Seattle-area company, Interlune, has its own plans to extract valuable materials from lunar soil. The startup's first target is helium-3, which is more plentiful on the moon than it is on Earth and can be used in applications ranging from quantum computing to nuclear fusion.

“Our vision is really big,” Interlune co-founder and CEO Rob Meyerson said. “We want to put a fleet of five electric harvesters on the moon in the 2030s that'll extract this helium-3 gas and bring it back to Earth.”

Some space-centric companies plan to make at least some of their money down here on Earth. For example, Stoke Space has spawned a venture called BoltLine to commercialize the software platform it uses to track timelines for product development.

“I see it going further into areas of timekeeping as well as cost tracking, really giving us very accurate models for how much things cost — which could be utilized across the board, or if you're developing satellites, or if you're actually looking at how much it would cost to change frequency bands, change the type of hardware, any of those types of things,” said Kelly Hennig, Stoke Space's chief operating officer. “And so I see that as being a very, very good opportunity for us to incorporate AI.”

AI also plays a big role in Amazon's Project Kuiper satellite broadband network, which is scheduled to begin delivering service to customers by the end of the year.

“Kuiper is a software-defined network, and so AI can have huge productivity gains,” said Chris Weber, Amazon's vice president of sales and marketing for Project Kuiper. “I'd say the single biggest thing outside engineering, software, etc., is the way we manage the network and manage capacity to provide a superior experience to customers.”

Project Kuiper's main objective is to offer high-speed internet access to millions of people around the globe who are currently underserved, but Weber said he's learning about use cases that he hadn't thought about when he joined the Kuiper team 13 months ago.

“We just announced a deal with JetBlue,” he noted. “We're very excited about how that's going to be game-changing for anybody who's had poor connectivity or inefficient connectivity on a plane. A couple of the new ones that I'm learning about, I'm still very clueless.”

For example, low-latency broadband access is a big deal for high-frequency market trading. “The amount of money people are willing to pay for every millisecond of performance advantage is huge,” Weber said.

Then there's the golf circuit. “PGA Tour was interesting,” Weber said. “For every tournament, they lay down 40 miles of fiber. … So whether it's us or others they look at, they can do a massive reduction in the efforts to get those tournaments. And you can take almost any remote sporting event, be they PGA or Formula One. All of them have the same issue.”

Muscular Dystrophy UK, a charity working on behalf of 110,000 children and adults living with more than 60 muscle-wasting conditions, has awarded £140,944 in funding to Dr. Rebecca Jones at Aston University for a project to understand the cause of a condition called inclusion body myopathy.

The condition, also known as VCP multisystem proteinopathy type 1 (VCP MSP-1), is a rare and often overlooked condition that affects muscles, bones and nerve cells. Symptoms can vary widely from person to person, but include muscle weakness, bone disease and memory issues. There are currently no effective treatments and scientists still don't fully understand all the processes that lead to this damage or the reasons behind the differing symptoms.

The four-year project led by Dr. Jones, who is a lecturer in the School of Biosciences, will explore how changes in a protein called VCP cause muscles to become weak in people with VCP MSP-1. Dr Jones and her PhD student will focus on how these changes impact how muscles repair themselves, how the structure of muscle cells is affected, and how muscle fibres are formed.

By understanding what goes wrong in these processes, scientists hope to find ways to slow down or stop the condition - potentially leading to the first targeted treatments.

The project is one of 13 new research projects being funded by Muscular Dystrophy UK in England and Northern Ireland, with a total investment of £2m. It is the first time the charity has funded research at Aston University and the first time it has funded research into inclusion body myopathy.

Dr. Jones said:

"Receiving this funding from Muscular Dystrophy UK means a great deal to me. It's the first substantial grant I've received. It means I can now explore the translational aspect of my research interests in DNA replication and the nuclear membrane. I really hope that we can contribute to the growing body of research on inclusion body myopathy and ultimately make a difference to the people living with this life-changing condition."

We're proud to be increasing our investment in research year after year - reaching new areas, exploring more conditions, and supporting a growing community of scientists. Our funding at Aston University reflects that ambition, supporting research into VCP MSP-1 for the first time. This project expands our reach into rare and often overlooked conditions, while also nurturing the next generation of researchers through support for Dr Rebecca Jones and her PhD student."

Kate Adcock, director of research and innovation at Muscular Dystrophy UK

Another project led by Professor Jordi Diaz-Manera, at Newcastle University, will also be exploring the condition further. With the latest investment, this brings the charity's total research commitment to almost £10m. Across more than 25 conditions, it's now supporting 51 active projects that aim to deepen understanding, explore new treatments, improve care and make a meaningful difference to the lives of those living with muscle wasting and weakening conditions.

Muscle wasting and weakening conditions can affect anyone, no matter where they live. The charity is adding to its portfolio of research that now spans the UK. This will help to reach more people and communities. The charity has also awarded new funding to researchers in Belfast, London, Newcastle, Nottingham, Oxford and Portsmouth.

For decades, amino acids have been added to medical formulations like insulin as stabilizers: these small molecules keep proteins (i.e. larger particles) from interacting in undesirable ways. And for decades, scientists have known that this works – but not why.

Now, an international team of scientists, led by the Supramolecular Nano-Materials and Interfaces Laboratory in EPFL's School of Engineering, has finally explained the 'why' – and in the process, unearthed a fundamental stabilizing effect of all small molecules in solution. The discovery has been published in Nature in collaboration with Alfredo Alexander-Katz at MIT and researchers at the Southern University of Science and Technology in China, including EPFL alumnus Zhi Luo.

"When suspended in solution, proteins are constantly changing shape around a central form, and so the prevailing theory has been that amino acids help keep proteins from misfolding," explains recent EPFL PhD graduate and first author Ting Mao.

"Now, we show that this is not the case. In fact, the stabilizing effect of amino acids has little to do with biology but is rather a general property of all small molecules in relation to larger particles, known as colloids, in solution."

To understand this colloidal effect of small molecules, Supramolecular Nano-Materials and Interfaces Laboratory head Francesco Stellacci suggests imagining two colleagues walking toward each other on opposite sides of a hallway.

Imagine these two colleagues get along really well and always want to stop and chat. If the hallway is empty, they will immediately spot each other and come together. But if the hallway suddenly becomes crowded, they may not see each other until they have already walked past, or even miss each other entirely. This phenomenon, called screening attraction, is how amino acids affect larger particles: they play the role of the crowd in the hallway, discouraging passing interactions."

Francesco Stellacci, Head, Supramolecular Nano-Materials and Interfaces Laboratory

Interestingly, scientists have known for over a century that salts do the opposite: they screen repulsion. In the hallway example, salt also plays the role of the crowd, only in this case it prevents two unfriendly colleagues from avoiding an awkward interaction.

"What we have discovered is that amino acids are essentially the anti-salt, because they have an opposite 'screening' effect. You can even see this in nature: it has been shown that when a plant is watered with salty water, its cells will produce more amino acids to help stabilize them as they become stressed by the increased salt concentration," says EPFL scientist and co-author Quy Ong.

The researchers say that their work provides a strong argument for reporting amino acid concentrations in scientific studies going forward. "In biology, one would never do an experiment without reporting the ionic (salt) concentration of a solution. Our work shows that amino acid concentrations have just as much impact, and should therefore be reported just as rigorously," Stellacci says.

Indeed, Stellacci is already pursuing the untapped potential of these molecular effects as part of his recently funded ERC Advanced Grant. "We want to understand how small molecules like amino acids are central to healthy biological function. With the support of our ERC grant, our goal is ultimately to predict which molecules can stabilize which proteins, and how much – something that is currently done by trial and error in biomedical research."

Researchers have identified the mechanism by which a common genetic mutation increases liver disease risk. Their findings suggest that healthy choices, such as increasing antioxidants and limiting exposure to smoke, may reduce the risk of this disease.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is an important enzyme that detoxifies harmful aldehydes produced in the body. While it is best known for metabolizing acetaldehyde –an aldehyde increased by drinking– it also plays a role in detoxifying other harmful aldehydes, including acrolein. Acrolein is a highly reactive aldehyde produced by environmental exposure to pollutants such as cigarette smoke. It damages proteins, DNA, and lipids, contributing to cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, and other conditions.

Some East Asians have a genetic mutation (ALDH2*2) that impairs the function of ALDH2. It is estimated that about 40% of Japanese people carry this mutation. The carriers of the mutation have an increased risk of esophageal cancer, especially among heavy drinkers and smokers.

To understand how acute liver injury occurs in living organisms when aldehyde detoxification is impaired, a research group led by Associate Professor Takeshi Izawa and graduate student Yuki Takami of the Graduate School of Veterinary Science, Osaka Metropolitan University, used knock-in mice. These mice are bred to reproduce the dysfunction of the ALDH2 enzyme seen in human ALDH2*2 carriers, making them useful for modeling the processes that lead to liver disease in humans and studying the changes that occur when aldehydes are rapidly produced in the body.

The researchers used allyl alcohol, an alcohol that is metabolized into acrolein in the liver. They found that increased levels of acrolein coincided with the level of multiple aldehydes rapidly increasing in the blood, a phenomenon they named an 'aldehyde storm.' This subsequently causes aldehydes to accumulate in the liver, causing severe liver damage. Their mechanism suggests the damage that can be caused in people after exposure to high levels of acrolein, especially in those with the ALDH2*2 gene variant.

The exposure level of acrolein used in this study clearly exceeds that of smoking; therefore the risk of severe liver damage like that reported in this paper occurring by smoking only is low. Instead, it is likely that the risk is higher in patients receiving anticancer drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, which is metabolized to acrolein in the body."

Takeshi Izawa, Associate Professor, Osaka Metropolitan University

Typically, acrolein is detoxified by the antioxidant glutathione; however, this did not happen in the mice. Instead, the researchers found that the levels of glutathione in the liver were severely depleted, indicating an inverse association with the aldehyde storm. Glutathione also suppresses oxidative stress and, accordingly, they found that the glutathione depletion promoted oxidative stress in the liver, leading to ferroptosis, a type of cell death. The researchers found evidence of tissue damage across organs, with the liver being the most severely affected.

"We identified for the first time the close relationship among aldehyde metabolism, redox balance, and the ferroptosis pathway," Takami said.

Their findings may also be relevant to people who carry the ALDH2*2 gene variant. These people typically have a reduced ability to break down aldehydes from alcohol, certain foods, and environmental chemicals. In these individuals, the liver's antioxidant defenses can be overwhelmed by sudden increases in aldehyde levels, leading to cell death and more severe liver injury. Their findings suggest that the aldehyde storm is a key part of this process. It also emphasizes the importance of people with this variant avoiding high aldehyde exposure, supporting their antioxidant system through a healthy diet, and monitoring their liver health.

"Acrolein is also found in electronic cigarette smoke and as a metabolite of anticancer drugs. The results of this study suggest that ALDH2*2 carriers may be at health risk from daily exposure to aldehydes caused by smoking and in certain medications," Izawa said. "Going forward, we plan to investigate other health effects of chronic exposure to aldehydes in ALDH2*2 carriers, particularly their involvement in cancer."

The study was published in Free Radical Biology and Medicine.

School closures during the COVID-19 pandemic imposed enormous long-term costs while other measures delivered better health outcomes for far less money, according to new research led by Oxford University's Department of Statistics and the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science analysing non-pharmaceutical interventions in the United States.

The study, published in BMC Global and Public Health, examined policies implemented across US states during 2020, before vaccines became available. Researchers from Oxford and the University of Washington analysed eleven different non-pharmaceutical interventions, combining disease modelling with economic analysis to calculate both health benefits and costs to society.

During this pre-vaccine period, policymakers relied entirely on non-pharmaceutical measures such as mask mandates, social distancing, testing, contact tracing, and facility closures to control the virus.

School closures prevented roughly 77,200 COVID-19 deaths and reduced transmission rates by 8.2% but created £1.6 trillion ($2 trillion) in future economic losses through damaged education. Students lost upwards of 0.35 schoolyears of learning, with some states keeping schools closed for nearly the entire 2020-2021 academic year.

In comparison, mask mandates cut transmission by 19%, making them more effective at preventing disease spread, while imposing minimal costs. Testing and contact tracing programmes also proved efficient compared to implementation costs.

The pandemic posed unprecedented challenges to decision-makers at all levels. While our policy response was not optimal – and we could not have expected it to be – our study shows that many of the measures implemented mitigated economic damage in addition to suppressing transmission of the virus. School closures were a notable exception."

Nicholas Irons, Lead Author 

An optimal combination of interventions could have cut the pandemic's total US impact from £3.7 trillion ($4.6 trillion) to £1.5 trillion ($1.9 trillion) while saving over 100,000 additional lives.

'Our study shows how using statistical methods to analyse all the sources of data could improve health outcomes and vastly reduce costs to society,' said co-author Adrian Raftery from the University of Washington. 'Going forward, better national surveillance data needs to be collected regularly in the US, as was done in the UK during the pandemic.'

The findings provide a blueprint for future pandemic planning, offering concrete data on which interventions deliver the best health outcomes while minimising economic and social disruption. The research suggests rapid deployment of testing, contact tracing, mask mandates and social distancing, combined with targeted facility closures, could control similar future outbreaks without massive educational costs.

The full paper, 'Optimal pandemic control strategies and cost‑effectiveness of COVID‑19 non‑pharmaceutical interventions in the United States,' is available in the journal BMC Global and Public Health.

Understanding the strategies and unmet needs of caregivers managing medications for people with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias may improve the lives of both caregivers and patients. A recent study, whose authors include Regenstrief Institute Research Scientists Noll Campbell, PharmD, M.S., and Malaz Boustani, M.D., MPH, describes the strategies and unmet needs of caregivers managing medications for people with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias.

By employing a user-centered design (UCD) approach and using virtual contextual inquiry, the researchers identified three distinct caregiver personas: "Checklist Cheryl," "Social Sam," and "Responsive Rhonda." Each persona embodies a different approach to medication management, varying in organization, technology use, collaboration and response to challenges.

The study found that caregivers employ diverse strategies, blending technology-based with physical methods. It also determined that needs - such as better symptom tracking, clearer communication guidelines and support for self-care - are not fully addressed by current digital or non-digital interventions. These nuanced personas can guide the design of customized caregiver support and digital health tools.

The primary resource provided by the study is the set of three detailed, empirically developed caregiver personas. Each persona profile includes that caregiver's approaches to acquiring, organizing and administering medication, monitoring symptoms, communicating with care networks and seeking medication information. The research also offers recommendations for digital health interventions tailored to each persona's unique needs, such as apps with customizable reminders, symptom and side effect trackers, and platforms for social support. The methodology - virtual contextual inquiry - also serves as a practical approach for future research.

These resources are intended for multiple audiences:

"Magic mushroom" edibles sold at smoke shops and convenience stores are likely to contain no psilocybin but instead a range of undisclosed active ingredients, a study led by an Oregon State University College of Pharmacy scientist shows.

The research collaboration, which included a state-certified testing laboratory and a scientific instrument manufacturer, published its findings today in JAMA Network Open, a journal of the American Medical Association.

In Portland, the scientists purchased 12 gummies and chocolates labeled as magic mushrooms and analyzed their contents. Psilocybin, the hallucinogenic compound produced by Psilocybe species of mushroom, was not detected in any of them. Neither was muscimol, a psychoactive compound found in Amanita mushrooms.

Among the undisclosed ingredients found were caffeine and extracts of the botanicals hemp and kava, said OSU's Richard van Breemen, professor of pharmaceutical sciences and a researcher at the university's Linus Pauling Institute. Also detected among the adulterants was a class of chemicals the collaboration coined "syndelics," shorthand for synthetic psychedelics. 

Syndelics represent a rapidly growing area of drug design, where medicinal chemists create novel compounds inspired by known psychedelic agents like psilocybin and LSD. Although this approach offers therapeutic potential for the discovery of drugs that might be useful for treating a range of mental health conditions, any new drug entity requires years of development to evaluate human safety and efficacy, and premature exposure to these compounds poses significant public health risks due to unknown pharmacology and toxicity."

Richard van Breemen, professor of pharmaceutical sciences and researcher, OSU

In the United States, LSD is a schedule 1 controlled substance, meaning it has a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use. But psilocybin is under investigation for treating depression and substance use disorders and is legal for medical use in Oregon (in Colorado, it's legal for recreational use).

"For safety, psilocybin products require both analytical standardization and production that follows current Good Manufacturing Practices," van Breemen said. "Advances in analytical chemistry are needed to detect new syndelics and other adulterants in consumer products, to expose misbranding, to support law enforcement and regulatory agencies, and to assist poison control centers and hospitals as they encounter overdoses caused by unknown compounds."

Key to those advances, he added, are studies such as this one that foster collaboration among academia, public health and industry to develop and validate detection methods using state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation like biomedical mass spectrometry. Different types of labs have unique capabilities, and combining them is necessary for the best retrospective analyses and real-time public health surveillance.

Van Breemen, whose lab at the Linus Pauling Institute specializes in dietary supplements and natural products, noted that during 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 180 emergency cases related to magic mushroom products. The cases spanned 34 states and included 73 hospitalizations and three deaths.

Collaborating with van Breemen on the study were pharmaceutical sciences graduate student Daniel Simchuk of Oregon State, Bjorn Fritzsche and Daniel Huson of Rose City Laboratories in Portland, and Scott Kuzdzal and Jonathan Ferguson of Shimadzu Scientific Instruments of Columbia, Maryland.

Ginseng has long been used in traditional medicine to replenish Qi and address deficiency syndromes, often manifesting as fatigue and immune compromise. Modern research is now elucidating the mechanisms behind these effects, focusing on ginseng's immunomodulatory properties, ability to improve quality of life, and potential role in cancer therapy. This review aims to consolidate recent findings on these aspects, highlighting both the promises and limitations of ginseng as a scientifically supported therapeutic agent.

Ginseng's immunomodulatory properties are primarily attributed to its active compounds, ginsenosides and polysaccharides. Ginsenosides Rg1 and Rb1 regulate cytokine production by inhibiting pro-inflammatory factors like TNF-α and IL-6 while promoting anti-inflammatory IL-10. This bidirectional modulation helps maintain immune homeostasis. Additionally, ginseng enhances natural killer (NK) cell activity via the TLR4/MyD88 pathway, increasing cytotoxicity by two- to threefold. Polysaccharides in ginseng, such as arabinogalactan, activate macrophage receptors and promote hematopoietic recovery, as evidenced by accelerated white blood cell regeneration in irradiated animal models.

Ginseng significantly improves quality of life, particularly in individuals experiencing sub-health states-a condition characterized by chronic fatigue, cognitive decline, and emotional disturbances. A clinical study using Renshen Yuanqi (RSYQ) Drink, a ginseng extract, reported an 85% improvement in sub-health scores among young adults after 30 days. Key benefits included reduced fatigue, enhanced cognitive function, and improved mood. These effects align with ginseng's traditional use in alleviating chronic fatigue and supporting mental well-being, likely mediated by ginsenosides with antidepressant and neuroprotective properties.

While direct cytotoxic effects of ginseng on tumor cells are not fully established, ginsenosides show promise in inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. For example, ginsenoside Rh2 suppresses the PI3K/AKT pathway in prostate cancer, reducing tumor proliferation and invasion. Other ginsenosides, such as Rg3 and Compound K, exhibit neuroprotective effects and ameliorate cancer-related fatigue by activating AMPK signaling. These mechanisms suggest ginseng's potential as an adjunct therapy in oncology, though clinical evidence remains preliminary.

Despite its benefits, ginseng poses safety concerns, particularly at high doses or when combined with certain medications. Adverse effects include nervous system disturbances, gastrointestinal issues, and interactions with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) and beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol). Ginsenosides may also inhibit liver enzymes like CYP3A4, potentiating drug toxicity. Concurrent use with other herbs, such as aconite, can lead to severe reactions. Therefore, careful dosing and monitoring are essential for safe integration into clinical practice.

A case study involving a 62-year-old female cancer patient demonstrated a significant reduction in sub-health scores after 30 days of RSYQ Drink intervention. Future research should focus on large-scale randomized controlled trials to validate these findings and explore ginseng's synergistic effects with conventional therapies. Optimized assessment tools for sub-health and mechanistic studies on immunomodulation and antitumor pathways are also needed.

Ginseng and its extracts offer compelling benefits for immune support, quality of life enhancement, and potential antitumor applications. However, robust clinical evidence is still limited, and safety concerns necessitate cautious use. Future studies should prioritize high-quality trials to fully harness ginseng's potential in integrative medicine.

CAR-T cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in treating hematologic malignancies and is now expanding into solid tumors. On June 1, 2025, The Lancet published positive results from the world's first randomized controlled trial of CLDN18.2 specific CAR-T in gastric cancer, led by Professor Lin Shen's team at Peking University. The study reported significantly prolonged progression-free survival and a 44 % improvement in overall survival. Recently, CAR-T has also shown great potential in treating autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis.



However, CAR-T development has long faced a persistent challenge: each new CAR targeting a novel tumor antigen requires the iterative development of a fully validated detection reagent to confirm CAR surface expression. This process is not only costly and time-consuming but may also introduce data bias due to insufficient antibody specificity, significantly delaying project timelines.

To address the challenge, Sino Biological has developed anti-whitlow 218 linker rabbit monoclonal antibodies, which specifically binds to the whitlow 218 linker sequence (GSTSGSGKPGSGEGSTKG). The antibodies are independent of antigen specificity, making it applicable across multiple CAR constructs and target antigens.

A CAR (Chimeric Antigen Receptor) is a genetically engineered receptor that combines the antigen-binding ability of an antibody with T-cell activation capabilities. The CAR structure comprises four main components:

The CAR positive rate is a critical metric for evaluating CAR-T product potency, directly influencing target recognition and cytotoxic efficacy. Monitoring CAR expression in peripheral blood or tissues post-infusion provides insights into in vivo expansion and persistence, informing treatment response, durability, and potential relapse risk. Dynamic CAR expression monitoring also helps assess immunogenicity and safety. Thus, a sensitive, reliable, and universal CAR detection system is vital for developing and evaluating CAR-T cell therapies.

Currently, approved CAR-T products target CD19 or BCMA, making flow cytometry with recombinant BCMA or CD19 protein the standard detection method. Although highly specific, this approach is limited to single targets and is unsuitable for CAR-T screening and preclinical development.

Several CAR detection methods have been developed, including Protein L (which binds immunoglobulins) or Fc-binding polyclonal antibodies. Protein L binds only to kappa light chains and fails to detect CARs containing lambda chains. Polyclonal antibodies may cross-react with patient IgG, causing false positives. Anti-idiotype antibodies offer high specificity and sensitivity by targeting unique idiotopes in the CAR's antigen-binding region, but they are challenging to develop and produce.

Anti-CAR linker monoclonal antibodies offer a universal strategy for CAR detection. Most CARs incorporate an scFv domain connected via flexible linkers such as Whitlow 218 or G4S. These standardized linker sequences provide a consistent and well-defined epitope. Regardless of the CAR's target antigen (e.g., CD19, BCMA, Claudin18.2, or CD22), anti-linker antibodies can detect CAR expression accurately, significantly improving universality and consistency compared to antigen-specific detection methods.

The 218 linker, known for its good flexibility and stability, is used in nearly 90 % of scFv-based CAR constructs. First described by Whitlow et al. in 1993, its amino acid sequence (GSTSGSGKPGSGEGSTKG) promotes correct folding between VH and VL domains, enhancing scFv stability and function.

Antibodies specifically targeting the linker region enable efficient and standardized CAR detection, offering five key advantages:

Detects any CAR construct containing the Whitlow 218 Linker, eliminating the need for target-specific reagents.

Available conjugated to FITC or PE for flow cytometry. Additional conjugates (APC, AF488, AF647, Biotin) are in development.

In-house developed rabbit monoclonal antibodies demonstrate minimal non-specific binding to PBMCs (<0.5 %).

Suitable for assessing transfection efficiency in vitro and monitoring CAR-T expansion dynamically in vivo.

Reduces time and resources needed for custom reagent development and validation.



Sino Biological provides a diverse range of products and services for CAR detection, supporting CAR-based cell therapy development.

How did different countries fare in achieving a balance between infection control and economic stability during the COVID-19 pandemic? To address this question, researchers studied the temporal dynamics of number of deaths, vaccination rates, production, and economic recovery across multiple countries. The study highlights that countries differed in risk attitudes and economic preferences that shaped policy decisions, hence impacting their performance. These insights will benefit governments and citizens in forming social defense during future pandemics.

The COVID-19 pandemic took the world by surprise, spreading rapidly and forcing governments to respond with unprecedented measures. While nations adopted different strategies, the central questions were the same everywhere: How should governments respond during this emerging infectious disease outbreak? How should people cooperate with their governments?

Responses varied widely, with some countries prioritizing strict infection control and others moving quickly to protect economic activity. Each approach yielded different outcomes in terms of public health and socioeconomic stability, offering valuable insights for managing future crises.

In this context, Professor Hiroaki Masuhara from the Faculty of Economics and Law at Shinshu University, Japan, and Professor Kei Hosoya from the Faculty of Economics at Kokugakuin University, Japan, conducted a cross-country analysis of the temporal dynamics of COVID-19. Their study, published online in the Journal of Policy Modeling on August 7, 2025, examined deaths, vaccination rates, production, and consumption across member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as well as Singapore and Taiwan, from early 2020 to the end of 2022.

The findings reveal that infection control was rarely permanent. Eastern European countries and the United Kingdom faced the greatest challenges in containing deaths, while Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan were initially successful in keeping death rates low during 2020. However, by 2022, these countries too saw significant increases.

On the economic side, efforts to suppress infection often came at the cost of reduced production and consumption. With the exception of Norway, Finland, and Israel, all countries experienced declines in production, while consumption fell everywhere. The authors highlight that people's behavior and attitudes-such as patience, trust in government, and tolerance of risk-played a crucial role in shaping policy outcomes.

Norway was most effective in achieving a balance between limiting deaths and resuming production and consumption. Similarly, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan managed to limit deaths in the early stages while managing economic revival. The Nordic countries and those bordering the Pacific Ocean share features of patience and risk-aversion, and have high levels of trust. In contrast, the US, which is considered less patient and less averse to risk, and Eastern Europe, with low trust levels, both experienced a higher number of deaths. Although these preferences may not be reliable and sufficient conditions for predicting fatalities, they have an impact. The influence of neighbouring countries is also noted to influence decisions.

The analysis also underscores the role of risk tolerance in reopening economies. The United States, with relatively low patience and higher risk tolerance, managed a steady economic recovery despite higher deaths. In contrast, Japan's strong risk aversion and low confidence levels were linked to weaker economic revival.

Reflecting on these findings, Prof. Masuhara notes, "To enhance public health and economic performance, it is necessary to take into account the different time preferences and attitudes toward risk that vary by country and its citizens. These insights should be recognized not only by governments but also by people themselves, and constitute an important component of social defense, including voluntary behavioral changes during future pandemics."

It is evident from these results that achieving both long-term infection control and stable economic performance is not simple. Barring "luck," the knowledge of risk attitudes and levels of patience will help shape appropriate public health policies for future pandemics. In the future, identifying the appropriate social measures that limit the spread of infectious diseases while sustaining the economy is likely to enhance societal performance as a whole.

As Prof. Masuhara concludes, "The success or failure of interventions depends on public patience and trust, and widespread cooperation with governmental interventions can contribute to building a robust social epidemic prevention system. We hope that our paper will serve as foundational material for future policy discussions."

Mentavi Health announced that its landmark, real-world validation study of the Mentavi Diagnostic Evaluation has been published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (JCP), a widely read and respected journal. The open-access article demonstrates that Mentavi's asynchronous, online evaluation is as accurate as a traditional face-to-face clinical interview in the diagnosis of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults and provides the first peer-reviewed evidence base for a fully digital diagnostic pathway for adult ADHD. The article posted on Psychiatrist.com at 8:00 am Central time on September 8, 2025 (see link and DOI below).

"Publication in a top-tier peer-review journal moves this evidence base forward, for our diagnostic evaluation specifically and for telehealth in general," said Barry K. Herman, MD, MMM, Chief Medical Officer at Mentavi Health and first author of the paper. "The study shows that an online ADHD diagnosis can be accurately assessed asynchronously, closing gaps in care created by specialist shortages and long waitlists."

Andrew J. Cutler, MD, Chief Medical Officer at the Neuroscience Education Institute, Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry at SUNY Upstate Medical University, and study co-author, commented: "As one of the first large peer-reviewed evaluations of a telehealth ADHD tool, this paper will shape guidelines and payer policies worldwide."

Publication in JCP sets a new standard for evidence-based digital mental health. It validates years of work to build the most rigorous online diagnostic platform and expands our mission to remove barriers of access to accurate mental-health assessments."

Keith Brophy, CEO of Mentavi Health

The prospective, real-world observational study compared the Mentavi Diagnostic Evaluation-a self-paced, asynchronous questionnaire interpreted by a doctorate-level psychologist-with a structured face-to-face clinical interview conducted via video. Primary endpoints were sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value relative to DSM-5 criteria. The protocol was IRB-approved and powered to detect ≥80 % sensitivity with 95 % confidence.

A new study published in Nature Communications Medicine led by neurosurgery researchers Sima Mofakham, PhD, and Chuck Mikell, MD, of the Renaissance School of Medicine (RSOM) at Stony Brook University, provides clinicians with data about the path to consciousness after traumatic brain injury (TBI) that may help pave the way for more personalized and effective patient care strategies in critical care and rehabilitation settings.

Every year, thousands of brain-injured patients are labeled as "unresponsive" in hospitals across the United States. Yet new research reveals that up to one quarter of these individuals may be conscious but just unable to show it. This disconnect, known as cognitive motor dissociation (CMD), represents one of the most urgent diagnostic blind spots in neurology and critical care.

To address this problem, Drs. Mofakham and Mikell developed a first-of-its-kind artificial intelligence (AI) tool called SeeMe, which detects signs of covert consciousness by analyzing microscopic facial movements invisible to the naked eye. Their findings suggest that SeeMe can identify signs of awareness four-to-eight days earlier than traditional clinical exams.

The work directly addresses the central dilemma outlined in a landmark 2024 study in The New England Journal of Medicine by Bodien et al., which found that 15 to 25 percent of patients diagnosed as unresponsive in the intensive care unit (ICU) may retain high-level brain function, but standard bedside tests are not sensitive enough to detect it. This misdiagnosis delays treatment and rehabilitation for patients who may otherwise recover.

We developed SeeMe to fill the gap between what patients can do and what clinicians can observe. Just because someone can't move their limbs or speak doesn't mean they aren't conscious. Our tool uncovers those hidden physical efforts by patients to show they are conscious."

Dr. Sima Mofakham, senior author of the study, Associate Professor and Vice Chair of Research for the Department of Neurosurgery, and Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

In a clinical study of 37 patients with acute brain injury and coma, SeeMe used high-resolution video and computer vision to measure involuntary facial reactions to verbal commands like "open your eyes" or "show me a smile." These subtle responses, typically undetectable by doctors or nurses, were recorded and analyzed using machine learning.

In most of this patient cohort, SeeMe detected purposeful movement up to four days before the clinical care team recognized physical movements by the patients.

"This kind of work shows the future of medicine lies at the intersection of disciplines, as we begin to see more applications of AI and engineering in medicine. With such an approach, we aim to turn complex data into tools that can help doctors make faster and better decisions for patients when every hour counts," Dr. Mofakham emphasizes.

Additionally, the patients from the study with early SeeMe-detected responses were significantly more likely to regain consciousness and show better functional outcomes at discharge.

"This is not just a new diagnostic tool, it's a potential prognostic marker," says Dr. Mikell, neurosurgeon, co-lead investigator, and Clinical Associate Professor and Vice Chair for the Department of Neurosurgery.

"Families often ask us how long it will take for a loved one to wake up, or if they ever will. This study helps us answer those questions with more confidence, grounded in data, not just experience or instinct," explains Dr. Mikell, "We can use this information to personalize care, guide families, and optimize rehabilitation efforts."

The authors also suggest the ethical implications are profound with TBI patients and recovery. Misdiagnosis of unresponsive states can lead to inappropriate withdrawal of care, limited access to neurorehabilitation and missed windows for therapy.

The Bodien et al. study stressed the urgent need for objective tools to detect CMD at the bedside, tools that don't require expensive imaging or invasive procedures. SeeMe is one solution as it is noninvasive, inexpensive, and scalable, according to Drs. Mofakham and Mikell. The system requires only a camera and open-source software, making it viable even in resource-constrained hospitals and ICUs.

As SeeMe moves toward larger clinical trials and potential regulatory approval, the research team envisions integrating the tool into standard ICU practice, combining it with EEG and other data streams to create a multi-modal consciousness monitoring platform. They also believe that SeeMe stands as a powerful example of how AI can restore independence to patients by letting them speak without words.

The work for both studies was funded by multiple institutional seed grants that support the ongoing collaboration between the Departments of Neurosurgery and Electrical and Computer Engineering at Stony Brook University.

Carlo Ancelotti is well aware of his short-term situation with the Brazilian national team as they prepare for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. However, he is hopeful for a change that can see him stick around for the long term.

More news: Carlo Ancelotti Sends Clear Message On Neymar's Place With Brazil Squad

Ancelotti took over the national team's head coaching job in June, embracing his first international gig of his career. He was first an assistant with Italy during the 1994 World Cup, then embraced new chapters as he garnered respect as one of the best coaches in the sport.

He cemented his legacy with Real Madrid, winning multiple UEFA Champions League trophies while showcasing consistency with his winning formula. Trying to bring that over to Brazil, Ancelotti knows he has one year to pull that off by trying to win the World Cup. Despite the limited time, he hopes to continue beyond 2026.

"Preparing the World Cup for Brazil is something special," he said, via ESPN Brasil. "I signed the one-year contract. After the World Cup, everything is open. I believe that at that moment it was right to sign the one-year contract. I have no problem if the CBF wants to continue. There is no problem."

"As I said, I am very happy here, my family is happy too. We can think about it. We have time to talk about this, I have no problem continuing. It would be nice [to stay until 2030]."

More news: Neymar Breaks Silence on Not Getting Called Up by Brazil

Ancelotti is four matches into his coaching stint with Brazil. He has two wins, a loss and a draw so far. The team has had defensive stability, only conceding once, while scoring four goals in their June and September contests.

Brazil secured its ticket to the 2026 FIFA World Cup after beating Paraguay 1-0 in June. They have improved with their defensive quality under Ancelotti, getting three consecutive clean sheets before their 1-0 loss to Bolivia.

The next step for them will be bringing Neymar into the equation. The national team's all-time leading goalscorer has been absent since tearing his ACL in October 2023. He has since dealt with fitness issues, preventing him from returning to the pitch for Brazil aside from club matches with Santos FC. He would likely be available for the October window should he be fully healthy and in strong form.

The national team finished at the fifth spot of the CONMEBOL standings with 28 points and counting after getting eight wins, six losses and four draws. They went even with Colombia and Uruguay for the third spot while trailing Ecuador by one point and Argentina by 10 points.

Brazil will prepare for two friendly matches in October. They will first face South Korea on Oct. 10 at 7 a.m. ET before going away to face Bolivia on Oct. 14 at 6:30 a.m. ET.

FIFA forced a nation to forfeit a crucial World Cup qualifier after banning them from participating in international competition.

In the event of any government interference in a nation's football association, FIFA are forced to step in and have been known to suspend said country from playing.

It happened with both Pakistan and Congo in a similar timeframe and ahead of the 2018 World Cup, the Kuwait Football Association were banned.

In AFC qualifying for the showpiece, the Gulf State had taken 10 points after winning three and drawing one.

Advert

But the suspension , which came when they were second in Group G, meant they were prohibited from playing their remaining three fixtures - away games against Myanmar and South Korea and a home clash vs Laos.

All three games were awarded as 3-0 defeats, which meant they finished a point behind second placed Lebanon and also missed out on the 2019 Asian Cup qualifiers.

This was the third instance that FIFA suspended Kuwait due to failure to comply with regulations but in December 2017, the governing body confirmed that the suspension had been lifted thanks to the legal reforms made.

Advert

A statement confirmed that "the Kuwait Parliament has adopted a new Sports Law of Kuwait, which replaces all the previous ones and has been amended in order to be fully compliant with the FIFA Statutes and requirements."

Shortly after, Kuwait, who had a sole appearance in the World Cup in 1982, hosted the Gulf Cup shortly after they were allowed to resume.

Ahead of the 2026 World Cup, FIFA officially imposed two 3-0 forfeits to Equatorial Guinea over the use of ineligible player who is actually their record goalscorer.

Advert

Former Middlesbrough and Birmingham forward Emilio Nsue scored the winning goals in games against Namibia and Liberia but was hit by a six-month ban from international football after it was ruled the Spain youth international had not been formally cleared to play for the African side.

Nsue was cleared to play upon a successful appeal for African football governing body Feguifut, but Equatorial Guinea were not able to win back the points after Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) dismissed the case.

CAS' statement read: "Since the appeal is directed solely at FIFA and does not name the NFA and LFA as co-respondents, the panel concludes that the appeal must be dismissed."

Contributor.

The U.S. Men's National Team righted itself after an underachieving performance against the Korea Republic in Harrison, N.J. by registering a solid 2-0 triumph over Japan in Columbus, Ohio.

Whether that will put the team in the right direction as it prepares to be one of the three hosts sides for the 2026 World Cup, it remains to be seen.

But there are a couple of issues that won't go away any time soon.

Given the diverse population of the United States, the men have found themselves as the visiting side at many stadiums. When the Americans have to play Mexico, whether it is in a friendly, Concacaf Gold Cup or World Cup qualifier, the crowd has been known to be partisan to El Tri (outside of Ohio). Many Mexican fans don't get opportunities to watch their heroes play live and when the team comes to town, whether it is Los Angeles, Chicago or Charlotte, N.C., the fans will show up in droves.

In contrast to the rest of the world, the USMNT doesn't play in only one or two venues. For many teams, the preferred city is their nation's capital.

Then again, many countries are not as spread out as the USA is.

So, both national teams visit various venues to showcase the team whether it is in the Pacific Northwest, Middle America, the Southeast or Northeast.

Given their success and popularity, the U.S. women many times will play in front of pro-American audiences, many, if not most are sellouts.

The men?

Not so much.

The Midwest might be the best place for USMNT teams; specially Ohio as the U.S. has notched five historic dos a cero wins over Mexico in World Cup qualifying over the last generation. That includes victories in 2001, 2005, 2009 and 2013 in Columbus, and another one in 2021 in Cincinnati.

As for other cities and venues, modern transportation has allowed fans to get from here to there in a decent amount of time.

Like it or not, playing in front of non-partisan crowds at home will be with for the team to contend with for the foreseeable future. It has been for decades.

If there is an upside in playing in front of "enemy" spectators at home, it could toughen up the players.

The second issue is playing in the metropolitan New York/New Jersey area.

Starting with a 1-0 loss to Canada in Newark, N.J. on Nov. 28, 1885, a U.S. men's nation side has played 30 times in the region and has recorded a 9-12-9 mark.

Pretty mediocre.

But let's put the current results under a microscope.

The Americans are 1-7-3 in their last 11 matches there, including that 2-0 defeat at Sports Illustrated Stadium.

The U.S. has been shut out in eight of those matches, scoring only three times. The Americans own a 488-minute scoreless streak in Jersey, dating back to a World Cup warm-up match, a 2-1 triumph over Turkey on June 1, 2014. Clint Dempsey is the last American to find the net for the team in New Jersey, scoring in the 52nd minute.

That 11-game run also includes a devastating 2-0 defeat to Costa Rica in a vital World Cup qualifier on Sept. 1, 2017, that helped seal the Americans' fate of missing the 2018 tournament in Russia.

We don't know if U.S. Soccer will ever bring a qualifier back to the area, but they are certainly good reasons not to.

Friendlies, however, are another matter.

An interesting note: The last time the USMNT played in New York City proper was a 3-3 draw in an international friendly before 10,108 spectators at Yankee Stadium on Sept. 15, 1968. Tuesday will be the 57th anniversary of that encounter.

Not much is known about this game, but some of the names might be familiar: defender Bob Gansler, who coached the U.S. national team at the 1990 World Cup, Willy Roy, a scoring terror in the early days of modern U.S. professional soccer, who scored a goal at Yankee Stadium. Both men are in the National Soccer Hall of fame.

Here is a link to a story that this writer wrote about the history of the USMNT in the New York/New Jersey area:

NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY: How the USMNT has fared in the metro area - Front Row Soccer

Incredible as it may sound, there are no stadiums east of the Hudson River in New York that are natural venues for soccer.

Yes, New York City FC plays most of its games at Yankee Stadium and at Citi Field, when the Yankees are at home. But they are baseball parks and need to be reconfigured for soccer. And fans necessarily get the optimum view of a soccer game.

And in this day and age, with so many soccer-specific stadiums in Major League Soccer and in lower division leagues, placing a national team in a baseball stadium would not be a good idea.

But there is a solution just over the horizon.

In 2027, NYCFC is planning to unveil its new stadium in Willets Point, Queens, adjacent to Citi Field (barring building delays that New York City is well known for). It will be a state-of-the-art facility. Moreover, it will be a soccer-specific stadium, and fit for a national team, the USMNT, in the city.

Hopefully, U.S. Soccer will schedule a friendly at the new venue to play the beautiful game in the most cosmopolitan city in the world.

It certainly would be an appropriate place to host an international soccer game.

After almost six decades, it is about time.

David Datro Fofana's rollercoaster Chelsea career has taken another wild turn after the forgotten striker was shipped out on loan yet again, this time to Turkish outfit Fatih Karagumruk S.K. The Ivorian, who cost the Blues £11 million when he arrived from Molde in January 2023, has failed to nail down a place at Stamford Bridge and has been passed around Europe like unwanted baggage.

Looking to snag tickets to 2026's World Cup, where 48 nations' soccer teams will battle in stadiums around the U.S., Mexico and Canada?

FIFA, soccer's global governing body, said on its website that, due to expected high demand, tickets will be released in phases.

And Wednesday, Sept. 10, was the early-ticketing process's first day.

“With just 10 months to go until the FIFA World Cup 26 kicks off, we are excited to launch the first phase of ticket sales for the tournament,” Heimo Schirgi, FIFA World Cup 2026 chief operating officer, said in a Sept. 3 news release on FIFA's website. “This marks a momentous milestone as we build up to this historic event, and we look forward to millions of fans joining us in North America next June.”

Here's how FIFA said it works. The Sept.10-to-Sept.17 window is known as the Visa presale draw entry period. First, set up a FIFA ticket ID account, then use a Visa card to log in using the FIFA ID to enter the ticket draw, according to FIFA's website.

The presale draw is subject to rules at FIFA.com/tickets. Fans must be 18 or older to enter, and no purchase is needed to enter or win.

FIFA said timing of someone's entry in the presale draw won't affect the fan's chances of success. After a randomized selection process, successful applicants will be notified by email beginning on Sept. 29 of a day and time slot to buy tickets — subject to availability. Time slots will start Oct. 1. FIFA said a successful draw application does not guarantee tickets will be available to buy during the time slot.

The World Cup will play out at 16 stadiums from June 11 to July 19. FIFA said there will be single-match tickets to all 104 matches made available, as well as venue-specific and team-specific tickets.

According to FIFA, tickets will range from $60 for the least-expensive seats at group-stage matches to the most exclusive seat hitting $6,370 for the World Cup final. The Athletic reported that FIFA said it will use dynamic pricing, in which ticket prices will vary depending on demand and that New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has taken issue with that approach.

People who are not eligible to be part of the Visa presale draw, were not successful in getting tickets in the draw or want to make more purchases will be able to in subsequent sales phases, FIFA said.

Upcoming dates to watch:

Expected to be Oct. 27-31 is the early ticket draw. Time slots for purchase for this round are expected to be mid-November to early December. It will also involved what FIFA said is a randomized selection process in which applicants receive a time slot to buy tickets, subject to availability.

Dec. 5 is the final draw, then in mid-December there's a random-selection draw. In 2026, closer to the tournament, there can be last-minute sales.

Stadiums holding matches closest to the Lower Hudson Valley will be MetLife in New Jersey — which, among eight of the cup's matches will host the final that crowns the winner — Gillette in Massachusetts, and Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field.

Other notable venues include Mexico City's Estadio Azteca, where legends Pele of Brazil and Diego Maradona of Argentina had stand-out performances in the 1970 and 1986 World Cups, respectively. Maradona scored what was called the "goal of the century" against England there.

Among questions ahead of 2026's World Cup is whether icon Lionel Messi of Argentina — who had an astounding career playing for Spain's titans FC Barcelona — will play. He led Argentina to victory in an all-time classic nailbiter over France at 2022's World Cup in Qatar and has become a phenomenon in the U.S., filling stadiums in his career's latter years playing for Inter Miami in Major League Soccer.

Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney feels a certain former Manchester City player was one of the most underrated players of his time. The Old Trafford legend, still the top scorer in Manchester derby history, recalled the brutal 6-1 hammering by Manchester City in 2011 – and singled out one striker who, in his eyes, never got the respect he deserved.

Xabi Alonso's side scored two good goals and overcame a silly sending off to stay undefeated in La Liga.

Kylian Mbappe scored one and assisted another, and Real Madrid overcame a silly Dean Huijsen red card to grind out a 2-1 win over Real Sociedad.

Los Blancos were on it from the start. They had a goal ruled out after three minutes, when Arda Guler's clever strike was chalked off due to an offside in the build up.

VAR didn't intervene 10 minutes later. Madrid's opener was classic Mbappe, a dart in behind and drilled finish to give his side a 1-0 lead. He almost made it two shortly after, but his curled effort clipped off the post. But Los Blancos made it interesting. La Real threatened here and there, and were handed a lifeline on half an hour when Huijsen was sent off for dragging down Mikel Oyarzabal as he ran through on goal. Still, Madrid added a crucial second just before half time. Mbappe made it, beating his man and cutting back to a grateful Arda Guler, who poked home. 

Los Blanos insisted on making it difficult for themselves, though. Dani Carvajal handled the ball in the box, and Oyarzabal converted the ensuing penalty with ease. La Real never found a crucial second, though. Thibaut Courtois made a handful of impressive saves and timely interventions to maintain the lead. It wasn't pretty, but Madrid got the job done

Carlo Ancelotti was honest about Neymar's place with the Brazilian national team as they prepare for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Neymar has been absent from the squad since suffering a torn ACL in October 2023 in their 2-0 loss to Uruguay. He has missed the remainder of World Cup Qualifying as well as the 2024 Copa America, which stunted the stability of quality performances for the national team.

Ancelotti took over the reins in June but hasn't been able to bring the superstar forward back due to fitness issues. Shortly after Brazil concluded their qualifiers, he made it clear about his chances on being with the team for the World Cup.

"We are not going to observe how Neymar plays, obviously. Everyone knows his talent," Ancelotti told ESPN Brasil's Pedro Ivo Almeida. "In modern football, to take advantage of his talent, the player has to be in good physical condition. If he is in his best physical condition, he will have no problems being in the national team."

"Everyone wants Neymar in the national team in good physical condition. I spoke with him, and I said 'you have time to prepare in the best way to be there and help the team try to do their best in the World Cup.'"

Ancelotti even explained how he would use Neymar when he's fully healthy and available to play for Brazil. The manager went as much to say that he would be in the attacking midfield or be up top as a striker, taking into account his current condition at age 33.

"I spoke with him. He came to the hotel before the game against Paraguay [in June] and we talked about it," the former Real Madrid boss added, via ESPN. "Everything is clear, the idea remains the same."

"[I would select him] as an attacking midfielder or striker, he has to play centrally, he can't play on the outside because modern football needs forwards who have physical quality, it's very important. He can play as an attacking midfielder without problems."

The national team finished at the fifth spot of the CONMEBOL standings with 28 points and counting after getting eight wins, six losses and four draws. They went even with Colombia and Uruguay for the third spot while trailing Ecuador by one point and Argentina by 10 points.

Brazil will prepare for two friendly matches in October. They will first face South Korea on Oct. 10 at 7 a.m. ET before going away to face Bolivia on Oct. 14 at 6:30 a.m. ET.

Santos shared a contradictory update on Neymar's fitness after the superstar was snubbed by Brazil boss Carlo Ancelotti. The Italian suggested injury concerns were behind the decision, claiming the forward had suffered another setback. For a player desperate to make his mark at next summer's World Cup, it was a bitter pill to swallow.

Chelsea's plan for new signing Facundo Buonanotte has been revealed after signing the Argentine midfielder on a season-long loan deal from Brighton on deadline day. Buonanotte was close to sealing a temporary switch to newly-promoted Leeds United, but the Blues swept in to hijack the deal, which saw them pay a £2 million (€2.3m/$2.7m) loan fee for the Brighton sensation.

Chelsea agreed personal terms with Mohammed Kudus and planned to sign him early for the Club World Cup, but their player plus cash deal was rejected according to The Athletic.

The Blues had a busy summer in which they made six signings, five of which were attackers as the frontline underwent a major overhaul.

Joao Pedro has made the biggest impact, whilst Argentine duo Alejandro Garnacho and Facundo Buonanotte could make their debut against Brentford on Saturday.

Whilst Chelsea are happy with their business and have added some top quality attacking players to their squad it could have been different.

Chelsea were linked with Kudus earlier this summer, and reportedly had a player plus cash deal rejected by West Ham for the Ghana international.

The Blues didn't return with a straight cash offer for Kudus and he ended up joining rivals Tottenham instead in a deal worth £55m.

However, things could have been different, and The Athletic have reported the Blues had agreed personal terms with Kudus.

The report adds Chelsea planned to sign him early for the Club World Cup, but their offer of £40m plus Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall was rejected.

Chelsea seemingly then switched their attention to Xavi Simons, but despite strong interest the Blues never made an offer and he too ended up at Tottenham.

This wasn't the first time Chelsea were close to signing Kudus, and they also agreed terms with him when he was at Ajax in 2023.

Chelsea's offer wasn't deemed good enough by Ajax, and Kudus instead ended up joining West Ham, where he had a successful first season.

It wasn't all a disaster for Chelsea as they ended up signing Cole Palmer that summer, but this is now two occasions in which a deal for Kudus has been so close yet so far.

Carlo Ancelotti urged Neymar to prove he is in "good physical condition" as he believes he could be an important part of Brazil's World Cup squad.

Neymar has not played for Brazil since October 2023, when he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.

Since his recovery, the 33-year-old has moved to boyhood club Santos but has been excluded from both of Ancelotti's squads so far amid ongoing injury issues.

It was originally stated that Neymar had been left out of the September squad due to injury, which the striker disputed, and Ancelotti later confirmed he had been left out due to “technical” reasons.

Neymar, who is Brazil's all-time top scorer with 79 goals, has the second most caps for his nation (behind Cafu), with 128 appearances.

He has scored six goals and registered three assists since returning to Santos, but Ancelotti said it will be Neymar's fitness, not his talent, that determines if he will be at next year's World Cup.

"We are not going to observe how Neymar plays, obviously. Everyone knows his talent," Ancelotti told ESPN Brasil.

"In modern football, to take advantage of his talent, the player has to be in good physical condition. If he is in his best physical condition, he will have no problems being in the national team.

"Everyone wants Neymar in the national team in good physical condition. I spoke with him, and I said, 'You have time to prepare in the best way to be there and help the team try to do their best in the World Cup'."

Brazil secured their place in next year's tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada in June, but after finishing their qualifying campaign with a disappointing 1-0 loss to Bolivia, they ranked fifth in the table.

Ancelotti was not disheartened by that result, though, and is still eagerly anticipating his first World Cup as a manager.

"Preparing the World Cup for Brazil is something special," he said.

"I signed the one-year contract. After the World Cup, everything is open. I believe that at that moment it was right to sign the one-year contract. I have no problem if the CBF wants to continue. There is no problem.

"As I said, I am very happy here, my family is happy too. We can think about it. We have time to talk about this; I have no problem continuing. It would be nice [to stay until 2030]."

                The Nerazzurri look for vital away points to revive their campaign.            

In a high stakes contest that could have huge repercussions in the 2025 Serie-A title race, Italian giants Juventus and Inter Milan will lock horns on Saturday evening. While the men in black and white have been flawless in the league so far, Cristian Chivu's men dropped points prior to the international break. With both teams looking to dethrone Napoli for national supremacy, this match-up holds huge importance.

Last season, an average campaign saw Juve finish fourth in Serie-A – two spots behind Inter. However, the Turin-based side held the trump cards in their 2024-25 battles. After a thrilling 4-4 draw in October, Francisco Conceicao's solitary goal determined the return fixture in Juventus' favor. The Bianconeri and Nerazzurri are the two most decorated setups in terms of Scudetti won over the years, and will renew their rivalry at the Allianz Stadium.

Here's all you need to know about the odds for the top scorer, top assist provider and much more – as per BetMGM:

Here are the odds for the first goal-scorer and any time goal-scorer for Juventus vs Inter Milan in the 2025 Serie-A (via BetMGM):

Inter's leading marksman Lautaro Martinez is set to lead the line yet again, with +360 odds of being the first goal-scorer and favorable +170 odds of scoring a goal on Saturday. The 28-year-old has 1 goal and 1 assist so far in the 2025-26 club campaign. He is closely followed by Juve's Jonathan David – who has +400 odds of scoring first. The terrific trio of Dusan Vlahovic, Marcus Thuram and Kenan Yildiz – all of whom are ace difference makers in the final third – complete the top five.

Here are the odds to assist any time for Juventus vs Inter Milan in the 2025 Serie-A (via BetMGM):

Jonathan David's elite vision and hold-up play have given him favorable +525 odds of being the top assist provider on the money line. Kenan Yildiz matches him at +525 due to his quality deliveries in the box. While Weston McKennie (+550) and Denzel Dumfries (+575) have an innate ability to make runs and nail the deciding pass, Filip Kostic is not too far behind (+575).

Jonathan David @ +125 as per BetMGM:

David has scored 1 goal in 2 Serie-A matches so far this season, and also notched a goal for Canada during the international break. Owing to his consistently good performances for Juve and his ability to set up the play for his teammates, the 25-year-old has been given favorable odds to score or assist on Saturday.

Lautaro Martinez @ +125 as per BetMGM:

Forming one of the most formidable attacking duos alongside Marcus Thuram in Inter's 3-5-2 setup, Lautaro Martinez is the trusted veteran of the Nerazzurri. With well over 100 goals and 25 assists for Inter in his Italian league career alone, Martinez is a proven match-winner for the 2023-24 champions.

Kenan Yildiz @ +185 as per BetMGM:

Yildiz has a knack of occupying key spaces on the left, particularly when Juve are in their 3-4-2-1 shape. The 20-year-old attacker already has 2 assists to his name this season, both of which came in Le Zebre's 2-0 rout of Parma on the opening weekend. According to the odds market, he is likely to continue his form in the league.

(Odds via BetMGM):

Lautaro Martinez is the most likely player to score two goals, according to the moneyline. He is closely followed by Jonathan David, Kenan Yildiz, Marcus Thuram and Dusan Vlahovic.

by Martina Alcheva September 13, 2025

Real Madrid remains in full control of La Liga after three wins from three, but there's a bigger story looming over the Bernabeu — the possible early comeback of Jude Bellingham. While Xabi Alonso's men prepare for a tough away trip to Real Sociedad and the start of their Champions League campaign, fans are wondering when they will see the 22-year-old midfield star back on the pitch. The answer, it seems, might come sooner than expected.

Los Blancos have looked sharp to start the season, sitting top of the table alongside Athletic Bilbao, but the next few weeks will test their depth. With Champions League nights returning, Real Madrid must balance La Liga ambitions with European commitments.

One of the most pressing questions is whether Bellingham can return in time to influence some of these crucial fixtures — including the high-profile Madrid derby against Atletico and the first Champions League matches of the campaign.

Bellingham's absence has been felt keenly in the Spanish capital. The midfielder has not featured this season after undergoing surgery to repair a long-standing left shoulder injury that first flared up in November 2023 against Rayo Vallecano. For months, he soldiered on, playing with a heavy brace for both club and country, but after the Club World Cup this summer, the decision was made to operate.

The expectation back in July was that Bellingham would be sidelined for around 12 weeks, meaning an October return at the earliest. His rehabilitation, however, appears to be progressing faster than expected.

It was during his pre-match press conference that Alonso revealed the latest on Madrid's midfield engine — and his comments offered a glimmer of hope to Madridistas. “I want to be a little optimistic and hope he's ready before October,” the Spanish manager said. 

“He's doing partial training, without contact, because we are protecting him. Jude is making a great effort in his recovery. Let's see if he can take steps forward next week, and when we feel good, we'll be waiting for him.” The news will be music to the ears of supporters, as it means there is now a real chance of seeing Bellingham feature in a Madrid shirt again this month.

According to reports in Spain, Madrid has circled a few dates on the calendar as possible return matches for the England international. While the clash against Espanyol on September 20 may come too soon, the away trip to Levante three days later is seen as a more realistic comeback option. And of course, all eyes are on the derby against Atletico Madrid on September 27, which could mark his first start since surgery if recovery continues smoothly.

Portugal star will hand Gianni Infantino the perfect publicity coup if he does play in America for the first time in more than 10 years, having already begun cosying up to Donald Trump

Is it still safe to stage the World Cup in the United States? After more headline evidence this week of the extreme nature of American gun violence, some may conclude that the answer is no. Nine months out from the opening game, it is now almost impossible to ignore this. But believe it or not statistics suggest more than 300 people will have been shot in America last Wednesday alone.

The same number will also be shot on Friday, Saturday, every day next week, and every day of World Cup year. On average 127 of these unnamed, largely non-famous people not called things such as the superstar influencer Charlie Kirk will die each day. Within this, youth gun deaths will be both alarmingly high and a register of social injustice: a disproportionate 46% of all young people shot will be black.

So maybe the events of Wednesday really do suggest America isn't a fitting World Cup host. Maybe it hasn't been for a while, as members of the African media suggested while questioning Gianni Infantino in Nairobi a few days ago, expressing alarm at the hostile policies of the Fifa president's special friend Donald Trump.

Happily Infantino cleared this up on the spot. It is apparently “a misconception” that the US might be a hostile or dangerous place for non-white visitors, which is no doubt a relief for all concerned. Today I feel like a concerned black African football tourist. But you know what? With the benefit of this unique insight I, Gianni, have decided it's all fine, so carry on.

You may still have concerns, or consider Infantino's assurances are worth exactly what you might expect from a person who seems to be composed entirely from a cylinder of reconstituted human inauthenticity crammed, kebab-meat-style, into a navy blue suit. Or that Fifa is already complicit in this state of alarm. The World Cup will offer a multibillion-dollar boost and a gloss of pure sportswashing to a regime that has used immigration theatrics to alarm its inhabitants and imposed brutal visa curbs on people from the wrong kind of competing nation.

But there is at least one shaft of light here. Before anyone gets too worried about travelling to America for the World Cup there was a suggestion this week that one highly influential person may be about to buck this trend. Enter: Cristiano Ronaldo, who has the chance to demonstrate that it's finally safe to go back in the water, a year into Trump 2.0.

It has been a good couple of weeks for Ronaldo. First he was given full superstar hysteria treatment during the Saudi Super Cup in Hong Kong, which included being mobbed during a surprise visit to a museum in Tsim Sha Tsui. A museum, you say? Surely an elite fitness powder emporium, or a skyscraper made entirely from yak fur and parmesan cheese? But this was a museum devoted entirely to the works of Cristiano Ronaldo, its official title the CR7 Life Museum, which certainly sounds like the best museum, a very tall, very handsome museum.

And as of Wednesday Ronaldo is now in line for a return to the US after an unexplained 12 years away. According to a story first published in the Athletic, Portugal are in talks to play a friendly against the US next March. The last time Ronaldo played in America was a summer tour game for Real Madrid in 2014. The last time he was photographed there was in 2016.

This is a significant development. Ronaldo still has a lifetime contract with Nike and assorted big-ticket endorsement deals. He even put his name to an NFT collaboration which has now collapsed into legal chaos, with Ronaldo at one point a named party in a class action suit, which may or may not be a related factor, nobody really knows.

What is certain is his decade-long absence from the largest consumer economy in the world, no tours, no brand-building appearances, no Major League Soccer contract, has left millions of dollars on the table, for a Ronaldo-industrial complex that definitely likes millions of dollars. So presumably there must be a good reason.

Ronaldo has never commented on this. There are no charges, and certainly no convictions. In fact it all seems to have been a terrible misunderstanding. But his absence coincides directly with the appearance of allegations in 2017, always vehemently denied, that Ronaldo sexually assaulted a teacher called Kathryn Mayorga in Las Vegas in 2009, and later offered a no-admission no-guilt payoff to make the whole thing stop.

The case was reopened in 2018, ran on to 2022, and has now, it seems, died a death. None of which means Ronaldo's presence in the US wouldn't have been met with protests, bad publicity, a reigniting of some kind of action. Pre-season tours at his various clubs over this period stayed away from the States. No pics, no talkshow stuff, no temporary deal with the Kansas City Wangdoodles.

And now it seems the waters may be clearing. And it is, let's face it, hard not to associate this with a change in voice, power dynamics, names at the top. Trump likes winners. Trump likes vibey, wealthy masculine guys. Trump knows what it is to suffer historical allegations that just won't go away. Trump technically even has the power to offer a legal pardon, even to a foreign national, even before any charge is made, or likely to be made.

Either way, in June there was an overt cosying up as Trump was presented with a CR7 shirt via the Portuguese European council president, António Costa, at the G7 summit in Canada (on it Ronaldo had inscribed “To president Donald J. Trump, Playing for Peace”, pandering very obviously to the aspirant Ballon de Peace winner).

And this really is a late-career crunch time for Ronaldo, 40, still a goalscoring machine, and with a chance to dip a toe in those waters before the World Cup, where he really just needs to be present to energise both the tournament and his own brand legacy.

For those who have followed his astonishing professional existence it is also a chance understand a little more clearly what Ronaldo is, which is still slightly mysterious. In many ways football has still not really come to terms with the magnificent monster it has built.

Ronaldo is arguably the most famous person in the world, already the most followed person on Instagram ahead of Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, God, authentic human feeling and diverse Kardashians. At the Club World Cup this summer he was massively present despite not taking part, anecdotally the most high-profile, obsessively admired footballer most local people could name.

He is also deeply now, the most prominent single catalyst of a transformation of the sport into a brand-driven global platform, a nation state arm of power, an endlessly amplified celebrity content machine.

For all that, it is still hard to get your head around the basic question of why exactly Ronaldo is quite so famous. Clearly he is a magnificent footballer. But still. Why the state of outright worship? Why is he so far ahead of everyone else in this? To understand this is to understand the internet, and the strangely intimate nature of online fame.

Ronaldo is perfect for the internet. He embodies its obsessions: self-made triumph, motivational success, bodily obsession, porn-like aesthetics. Ronaldo has mastered his routines, his intake, accumulated wealth spectacularly. As a facial signifier, a human logo, he has that indefinably moreish quality of the online hyper-famous. Lots of people are handsome. Ronaldo is handsome in a way that is always him, a face, a six-pack, a flaring neck you just have to click on.

What does he look like? A perfectly glazed wedding cake figurine. A hyper-advanced robot replicant at the interstellar fleet captain's ball. An avatar of human immortality made out of marzipan, yeti-sperm and greed.

This is often couched in a weird kind of reverence. “For most of my life I've always been worried I wouldn't be able to see Ronaldo,” one member of the Saudi Cup crowd told the South China Morning Post. Another said: “I like Ronaldo because of his values, what he stands for, it's very respectable.”

Is that what it is? Orderliness in a crazed and dysfunctional world. Devotional perfection. Success, attainment, compacted into a single lighted square. Ronaldo also got there first, colonised that space, understood his own power before anyone else. And now he has a chance, should the stars align, to breach the final consumer frontier, to conquer America decisively next summer, decks finally clear and with a president on hand who will be very interested in any hint of a brand-building collab.

Call me cynical, paranoid, conspiracy-prone but it seems inconceivable there hasn't been some kind of pre-chat, a feeling-out, a focus-grouping of what it may mean, optics-wise, good and bad, finally to get Ronaldo on that stage.

There are so many strange and manipulative aspects to America's public contortions right now, so many aspects that seem out of control, leading right into a World Cup where even the logo looks mildly sinister, a strange black cancerous date stamp oozing out from beneath that iconic, throbbingly veined golden trophy. Ronaldo to America just feels like a very natural extension, the ultra-influencer, here to bring peace, and above all to spread his own version of irresistibly monetised human theatre.

A disputed line call in the second set nearly threw the Frenchman off the rails in his eventual 7-5, 6-4 win.ByTENNIS.comPublished Sep 13, 2025 copy_link

Corentin Moutet didn't just need to overcome former Grand Slam champion Marin Cilic to send France to the Final 8 of the Davis Cup Finals. He also needed to overcome thousands of Cilic's fellow Croatians, who made their presence known in full voice after they felt their man was hard done by on the clay courts of Osijek.Moutet, who made his Davis Cup debut for Les Bleus just one day prior in a three-set comeback against 20-year-old Dino Prizmic, entered Saturday's reverse singles match against Cilic with the opportunity to put the 10-time champions into the Davis Cup Finals for the first time since 2019 after Nikola Mektic and Mate Pavic got the hosts on the scoreboard with a doubles win.After an hour, despite losing leads of 3-0 and 5-3, the world No. 39 was up a set, and France was on the precipice.But drama, something that often follows the Frenchman, began early in the second set—after Cilic vehemently disagreed with both Moutet and chair umpire Alison Hughes, who determined that a shot from the Croatian's racquet missed wide of the far sideline in the third game. The former Top 10 player eventually dropped serve, and after changing sides, proceeded to voice his displeasure at the decision.

Jeers rained down from the crowd, and more than once prompted contentious scenes between the two players, officials, and team captains Ivan Dodig and Paul-Henri Mathieu. The Dvorana Gradski Vrt sports hall turned into a pressure cooker, and a fired-up Cilic proceeded to come from a break down twice after the controversy to keep the home team in it.But, as Moutet told French reporters on the eve of the tie, he's not one to shirk away from such a scene."I like playing high-stakes matches. The more pressure there is, the more I like it," he said.Eventually quieting the crowd, Moutet sealed a 7-5, 6-4 win in straight sets by winning three consecutive games. Serving down 4-3, he crucially saved three break points, and finished off victory in nearly two-and-a-half hours.

"I saw the ball out," he said afterwards while apologizing to "everybody" and saying "we don't want to see that on the court."I'm just very sorry for what happened. I have a lot of respect for my opponent, a lot of respect for you," the Frenchman told fans. "He's such a great player, he's a legend of our sport. I didn't do it on purpose. If I knew [the ball was in], I would do something different ... I'm very happy that I made it."

 Belgium stands on the brink of an impressive away win in the Davis Cup Qualifiers second round after Raphael Collignon and Zizou Bergs delivered standout performances on Saturday in Sydney. 

 The No. 91 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Collignon upset World No. 8 and hometown favourite Alex de Minaur 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 inside Ken Rosewall Arena to give his country a perfect start in its bid for a spot at November's Davis Cup Final 8. The 23-year-old Collignon appeared to have lost momentum after a bright opening set in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with De Minaur, but he dug deep and battled through cramps to earn the first Top 10 win of his career. 

 “I think when you play for your country there is no pain,” said Collignon, who also defeated Casper Ruud last month at the US Open, in his on-court interview. “We always have great players, and this is unbelievable I think for a small country like ours.” 

 Bergs later sank Jordan Thompson 7-6(4), 6-4 to cap a perfect day for Belgium. A three-time Davis Cup finalist, including in 2015 and 2017, Belgium will now look to Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen to wrap up victory on Saturday, when the experienced doubles duo takes on John Peers and Rinky Hijikata. 

 “It feels great for the team,” said Bergs after his win against Thompson. “We did a great job today but we're far from the end still."

 Rune, Moller Put Spain On Back Foot 
A momentous Sunday beckons for Danish tennis in Marbella, where Holger Rune and Elmer Moeller have brought Denmark to the brink of a debut appearance at the Davis Cup Final 8. 

 Denmark is 2-0 up on six-time Davis Cup champion Spain after Saturday's action in which Rune defeated Pablo Carreno Busta 7-5, 6-3 and Moeller overcame Jaume Munar 2-6, 6-1, 6-4. The World No. 11 Rune was full of praise for the raucous atmosphere created by travelling Danish fans. 

 “It was incredible,” said Rune after the match, according to the Davis Cup website. “It was almost like playing at home.” 

 Denmark has not reached the last eight of the Davis Cup since 1988. The country will equal that showing with just one win from the three remaining rubbers in the tie. August Holmgren and Johannes Ingildsen are the nominated Danish players for the doubles rubber, which opens Sunday's schedule in Marbella. They are set to take on Pedro Martinez and Munar.  



 Germany, Austria, Argentina, France Book Spots In Bologna 
Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz added the finishing touches to a dominant display from Germany in Tokyo, where the doubles stars defeated Yosuke Watanuki and Takeru Yuzuki 6-3, 7-6(4) to seal victory against Japan and their country's spot in the Final 8. 

After Jan-Lennard Struff and Yannick Hanfmann had earned singles victories on Friday, Krawietz and Puetz notched their 18th win in 19 Davis Cup rubbers as a team to ensure Germany will compete in Bologna, where Final 8 action takes place from 18-23 November. Justin Engel then celebrated his Davis Cup debut by prevailing in a clash of #NextGenATP stars. The 17-year-old Engel defeated 19-year-old Rei Sakamoto 6-3, 6-7(2), 10-7 to wrap a 4-0 triumph for Germany. 

A thrilling tie between Hungary and Austria in Debrecen went to a deciding rubber on Saturday afternoon, and it was Jurij Rodionov who proved the hero for the visitors. Austria entered the day with a 2-0 lead, but hosts Hungary were soon back in contention thanks to Fabian Marozsan and Zsombor Piros, who downed Alexander Erler and Lucas Miedler 7-6(4), 7-6(2) in the doubles rubber. 

 With Piros then downing Lukas Neumayer 7-5, 7-6(6), the tie was level at 2-2 and the momentum was with Hungary. Yet the World No. 158 Rodionov stunned Marton Fucsovics 6-2, 6-1 to earn his country a spot in the last eight of the Davis Cup for the first time since 2012.

 Argentina had no such trouble converting a 2-0 overnight lead against the Netherlands into a straightforward victory in Gronigen. The 2016 champion moved into an unassailable 3-0 lead after Andres Molteni and Horacio Zeballos defeated Botic van de Zandschulp and Sander Arends 6-3, 7-5. 

 In Osijek, France defeated Croatia 3-1 thanks to Corentin Moutet, who overcame Marin Cilic 7-5, 6-4. Nikola Mektic and Mate Pavic had earlier given host Croatia hope in the tie with a 6-3, 7-5 victory against Benjamin Bonzi and Pierre-Hugues Herbert.

Fritz and Mensik exchanged breaks to start the contest, with the American overhitting a routine drive volley to hand back his initial advantage. There wouldn't be many more moments like that from Fritz's end of the court, as his timing and point-building grew in confidence to emerge as the locked-in competitor.At 3-3, Fritz found a way to break from 40-15 down. After being caught late on a forehand, Mensik double-faulted to bring the American to deuce. Though he erased a break point, the world No. 17 eventually dropped serve. Fritz curled a backhand passing shot for a second ad-out point ahead of Mensik's forehand breaking down again.Mensik staved off four set points in his next service game, before Fritz comfortably served it out. A brief rain delay followed, as the players exited the court. When play resumed, the momentum stayed with the hosts.

A double fault from Mensik generated an immediate break for Fritz. Continuing to pressure the 20-year-old, Fritz opened a double-break lead after the Czech's backhand drop shot failed to clear the net.A peculiar finish then played out. Fritz reached three match points at 5-2, only to watch Mensik claw back and break to stay alive. But then it was Mensik's turn to blow a 40-0 lead on his serve, wrapping the evening's action with an erratic backhand approach shot into the open court.“We needed this one. It feels great to come out and deliver for the team,” summed up Fritz in his on-court interview.Saturday's action begins with a doubles rubber, followed by reverse singles. The first team to reach three points advances to November's Davis Cup Final 8 in Bologna as one of seven countries looking to prevent Italy from capturing a third consecutive title.

The first team to reach three points advances to November's Davis Cup Final 8 in Bologna as one of seven countries looking to prevent Italy from capturing a third consecutive title.

Argentina is on the brink of a second consecutive appearance in the Davis Cup Final 8 after Francisco Cerundolo and Tomas Martin Etcheverry secured singles victories against last year's finalists, The Netherlands, on Friday.


Etcheverry set the tone with a 6-4, 6-4 triumph over Dutchman Jesper de Jong, converting his fourth match point to clinch the victory. Then, Argentina's top-ranked player, World No. 21 Cerundolo, followed with a 7-6(4), 6-1 win against Botic van de Zandschulp.

In front of an enthusiastic crowd in Groningen, Cerundolo overcame a nervy start to capture his 33rd tour-level win of the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. The first set alone featured six breaks of serve, but the Argentine jumped to a 4/0 lead in the tie-break, which ultimately helped him gain a one-set advantage on the home favourite. 


Argentina, 2016 Davis Cup champions, will look to apply the finishing touches on Saturday.

“It feels incredible,” Etcheverry said after his win, according to DavisCup.com. “I played very well. Getting the first point is really important.


“I'm very proud because I know what I did the past few weeks and how I have been training for this. It feels amazing. I love it. Davis Cup is really fun and I love to play here.”

The Netherlands reached the Davis Cup final in 2024, but Italy triumphed 2-0.

Tjen was already the first player from Indonesia to reach a WTA quarterfinal in over two decades.ByDavid KanePublished Sep 12, 2025 copy_link

Published Sep 12, 2025

Janice Tjen continued a spectacular breakthrough onto the Hologic WTA Tour at the SP Open in Sao Paulo, stunning Alexandra Eala, 6-4, 6-1 to reach the semifinals.“It still feels unbelievable to me,” Tjen said on court after the match. “It hasn't hit yet. All I can say is I'm pretty happy with how I played today.”Tjen was already the first woman from Indonesia to make a WTA quarterfinal since Angelique Widjaja in 2004 (Bali), and the 23-year-old went one round deeper over the streaking No. 3 seed in one hour and 12 minutes on Quadra Central.

Tjen was already the first woman from Indonesia to make a WTA quarterfinal since Angelique Widjaja in 2004 (Bali), and the 23-year-old went one round deeper over the streaking No. 3 seed in one hour and 12 minutes on Quadra Central.

Born in Jakarta, Tjen burst onto the scene less than a month ago at the 2025 US Open, winning three rounds of qualifying and shocking No. 24 seed Veronika Kudermetova in her Grand Slam main draw debut. Playing at the WTA 250 event in Sao Paulo, she knocked out No. 7 seed Leolia Jeanjena in straight sets and backed up the win with a 6-1, 6-0 win over Slovak qualifier Martina Okalova to book her spot in the last eight.“I was focusing on every point, especially playing against Alex Eala,” Tjen said. “We all know that she can come back at any time, and I was just trying to focus and stay in it until the end.”Waiting for her there was an in-form Eala, fresh off her first WTA 125K title run at the Guadalajara 125 Open earlier this month. The 20-year-old from the Philippines has been one of the biggest stories of the 2025 season, reaching the Miami Open semifinals with wins over Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys, and Iga Swiatek. She made her first WTA final three months later on grass in Eastbourne and dropped just two sets en route to the title in Guadalajara, rallying from a set down to defeat Pann Udvardy in the final.

She made quick work of her SP Open opposition to reach the quarterfinals and took a quick 2-0 lead on Tjen when their match began on Friday. But Tjen quickly caught fire from there, winning 12 of the final 15 games to surge into the semifinal in just over an hour.Standing between Tjen and her first WTA final will be either No. 2 seed Solana Sierra or No. 6 seed Francesca Jones, who each won their second-round matches in straight sets.

Tiafoe, meanwhile, had fallen to No. 29—his lowest ranking since 2024.Kicking off the tie Friday evening in Delray Beach, Fla., where play was delayed for a little over an hour due to rain, Lehecka showed that two defeats in two prior meetings with Tiafoe were nonfactors and that paper was indeed correct.🖥️ Stream the 2025 Davis Cup qualifiers LIVE on Tennis Channel

Delivering bigger blows from the baseline and maintaining the steadier serve, Lehecka scored the first point for the visitors with a comprehensive 6-3, 6-2 victory. For Tiafoe, it marked his sixth loss in seven Davis Cup rubbers spanning five appearances dating back to his 2018 debut.Both competitors fought off early pressure moments, with Tiafoe erasing a pair of break points in his first service game and Lehecka holding from deuce in consecutive trips to the line.At 3-4, 40-40, the two engaged in an extended rally that ended with a set-changing misjudgment from the home favorite. Tiafoe assumed his opponent's forehand up the line was sailing long. Lehecka instead clipped the line to earn break point, where Tiafoe double-faulted for the first time on the night.

Consistent ball-striking enabled Lehecka to put together a five-game run that carried over into the early stages of set two. Tiafoe fought off a break point to avoid falling behind 3-0, but struggled to keep pace with the powerful strikes coming across the net. He conceded the double break in his next service game by yanking a forehand wide and finished without creating a break point against the 23-year-old.“Every Davis Cup win is something special for me. These matches are something different from what we are living on tour,” Lehecka said afterwards on court.The pressure now shifts to Taylor Fritz, as he looks to get the U.S. back on even footing. His opponent, Jakub Mensik, notably edged the American No. 1 7-6 in the third to clinch their Miami semifinal on his way to a maiden ATP Masters 1000 title earlier this year.

	Following the news that Ego Nwodim was leaving Saturday Night Live, the reactions started to pour in.


	Nwodim, who joined SNL in 2018, announced on social media on Friday that she was exiting the sketch comedy series after seven seasons.




	“The hardest part of a great party is knowing when to say goodnight. But after seven unforgettable seasons, I have decided to leave SNL,” she captioned an Instagram post. “I am immensely grateful to Lorne for the opportunity, to my castmates, the writers, and the crew for their brilliance, support and friendship. Week after week on that stage taught me more than I could have ever imagined, and I will carry those memories (and that laughter) with me always. Now invite me to your weddings please!!!”

	Soon after the news broke, messages came through the comments from several former and current SNL stars as well as other celebrities.


	Cecily Strong, who left the show in 2022 after 11 seasons, commented: “Just texted you but I also want to say it loud and proud here: it was an honor and total joy to get to work with you. One of the best to ever do it.”


	Chloe Fineman, who is coming back for season 51, wrote, “One of the best to ever do it my friend. GOAT.” Also returning is Bowen Yang, who took to his Instagram Story to share a photo of Nwodim, writing: “the best.”

	











	Other notable stars who shared reactions included Jack Black, who commented on Nwodim's post, “Mic drop,” Together star Alison Brie wrote, “Congrats on an incredible run!!,” while Amber Ruffin wrote, “Congratulations! As long as I can still watch you perform, I'm good!”


	The announcement came after NBC seemingly confirmed who was returning for season 51, and Nwodim was included. In addition to Nwodim, Heidi Gardner, Michael Longfellow, Emil Wakim, Devon Walker and John Higgins are not returning for the upcoming season.


	Longfellow shared a picture of himself and Nwodim on his Instagram Story, and Walker posted a video of Nwodim and him from the Kinds of Kindness red carpet premiere in New York last summer.


	Season 51 will debut Oct. 4.

	With a swish of a wand and stir of a cauldron, Practical Magic 2 has officially wrapped production, star Nicole Kidman announced today on Instagram.


	The Oscar winner shared a short behind-the-scenes clip of her and co-star Sandra Bullock walking away from the cameras on a sun-soaked meadow. Bullock, also an Academy Award winner, can be heard saying, “Profile shot? Let's do a profile shot,” as Kidman bursts into laughter and embraces her.


	“That's a wrap on #PracticalMagic2! Thank you to the cast & crew for all your magic ✨,” Kidman captioned the video.

	Kidman last commemorated the reunion of the Owens sisters on the first day of production in mid-July, posting a video of the duo filming a scene. “The witches are back,” she captioned the clip on Instagram. “Owens sisters' first day on set!”

	A sequel to the cult classic 1998 original about two polar opposite sisters who are descended from a long line of witches, negotiations for original stars Kidman and Bullock to return as Gillian and Sally Owens, respectively, were first reported in June 2024. Praised for its feminist themes, soundtrack and genre-bending nature, the film followed the two family members and their aunts as they reckoned with the Owens curse, which dooms any man who falls in love with them. At the end of the Warner Bros. pic, the sisters form a quasi-coven with the townsfolk to break the ancient spell, triumphing over the curse and finally being accepted in their community as witches.

	











	 The sequel to the spooky movie is slated for release Sept. 18, 2026, with original cast Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing also returning as Aunt Jet and Aunt Frances, the matriarchs who took in Sally and Gillian after their parents died. Meanwhile, newcomers include Joey King, Lee Pace, Maisie Williams, Xolo Maridueña and Solly McLeod. Character details for the new faces are under wraps, as Deadline exclusively reported.


	Susanne Bier directs the followup from a script by Akiva Goldsman, a co-writer on the original, and Georgia Pritchett (Veep, Succession). Bier has worked with both Bullock and Kidman before, directing 2018's Birdbox and series The Perfect Couple.


	The original film, helmed by Griffin Dunne, was based on Alice Hoffman's 1995 novel of the same name, grossing more than $47 million stateside. Hoffman has since published two prequels to that book, as well as a 2021 sequel called The Book of Magic. Though plot details about Practical Magic 2 are scant, producer Denise Di Novi told Entertainment Weekly last year it would draw heavily from the source material.

Senior TV Writer


	In the Netflix documentary aka Charlie Sheen, Director Andrew Renzi (Pepsi, Where's My Jet?) was able to chronicle the rise and fall of the Two and a Half Men actor by relying on old family films, interviews with pals like Chris Tucker and Sean Penn and an extraordinary chat with Sheen's former drug dealer Marco.


	But the hallmark of the two-parter that dropped Sept. 10 was Renzi's eye-popping interviews with the actor himself. “I take it very seriously that I'm making something that ultimately creates a legacy piece for somebody,” Renzi tells Deadline. “This is the Charlie Sheen documentary, and there probably can't be another one. He has been such a privilege to work with because he had no editorial control over this thing, but he's able to look at it and say, “all right, good, bad, all the things. This is an honest portrait of me that I feel like was representative of my POV, which was what I chose to do.” It's a nice feeling to be able to walk away and say, okay, he's good with it. I'm good with it. My hands are clean. ”

	Here, Renzi explains how long the doc was in the works, why family members didn't participate, and how Marco of all people helped Sheen to get off crack. 




			Watch on Deadline		







DEADLINE Give us the origin story. Why Charlie Sheen?


ANDREW RENZI I wanted to enter the celebrity doc conversation through someone who felt more like me, maybe a controversial figure. Maybe somebody who's not so perfect. Charlie came to mind and I was able to get connected to him. We spent about eight months to a year getting to know each other before we shot a frame of the film. There was a long process of really figuring out whether this was even going to be a good idea. So from start to finish, it was about two years. It took some convincing. I didn't know Charlie. I knew Charlie through the historical record of the internet, you know what I mean? I certainly didn't know eight-years-sober Charlie Sheen. And I think that that was an amazing thing to experience. The only Charlie that I've ever known is a Charlie who's sober. That played a big role in us telling this story. I don't think he would've been able to do this eight years ago. So yeah, there was a long process of him understanding what the value of this would be. 

	











DEADLINE How did you come up with the title? 


RENZI Everyone has their own idea of who Charlie is. Everyone has their own idea of what they remember from him or what they want him to be like. I just found that to be a really provocative concept because a lot of this documentary seemed to be him unpacking that himself. And the obvious is that [he was born with the name of] Carlos Estevez. I just find it to be a really interesting detail. It's like the guy's not even Charlie Sheen, legally. So who is this guy? It was one of those things I threw down on paper one day and I was like, that's the one. And no one argued. 


DEADLINE Did you do two parts just so you can use the phrase Part Deux, a callback to Sheen's 1993 film Hot Shots! Part Deux?


RENZI Listen, if there was three parts, I would've done the same thing. There were a lot of iterations with this project. I had a feature at one point in my head. But the two parts were really born out of the fact that I wanted part one to feel like a romanticized version of what drug addiction can look like to a drug addict, like a Hollywood rocket ship … sex, drugs, and rock & roll recreations, almost make it feel sensational to a degree. And then in part two, have it all fall apart, just really peel back what it actually looks like to be in the depths of addiction. The only natural format was two parts. 


DEADLINE You started with the Two and a Half Men theme and Jon Cryer saying, “I'm not here to build him up or tear him down.” Why was that your start?


RENZI I think it was important to ground the audience with what, perhaps, is the most iconic thing about Charlie, despite all of the iconography around him. And the disarming nature of someone like Jon Cryer starting this thing felt good to me rather than just launching right into the chaos. I also really love the thematic concept of whether this a good idea. Is this a bad idea for me to be here sitting in front of you telling the story because of the cycle that has been his life? I just found that to be an urgent message for the doc. Is this going to open Pandora's box again? Or is he truly sober and feeling better and in a different place? 


DEADLINE Then you kicked off the anecdote where he actually flew a plane on his honeymoon!


RENZI That to me felt like the most Charlie Sheen in a nutshell that I could have possibly imagined. Here's a guy who's just married, on his honeymoon, drunk off his ass, and being given the steering wheel to a plane with 400 people behind him. That sort of power and mind fuck can't be quantified by anyone else in the world. That is such a specific experience for him to have. It was a power that no one else could experience. If anyone ever had any questions about why a guy didn't get sober sooner, there's your answer. You keep getting the fucking plane. 


DEADLINE You had a treasure trove of family super 8 footage to draw from. 


RENZI It was so cool. His sister was the family archivist and quite literally just had a box of undeveloped film. No one had seen those things. So I got to edit together Charlie Sheen's directorial efforts at age 8 as though he was doing it. I had hours and hours and hours of dailies that somebody, hopefully, gets to mine again and do something more with. I mean, there's Sean Penn setting up camera angles for Charlie at age 10. There was a different iteration at one point of this project that dove a lot deeper into Charlie and Chris Penn's relationship. Everyone's a little kid at some point. Not everyone's a little kid though that gets to make super 8 movies because they were on the set of Apocalypse Now.

	











DEADLINE You didn't delve into Chris Penn, but you spent some time on Charlie's friendship with Nicholas Cage. Why? 


RENZI I think Nic Cage was a turning point. It was that moment in Charlie's life where he became a superstar that also was going to march to the beat of his own drum. I think that union, that sort of unholy union, was pretty cool. Not many people knew they had this pocket of time together. It felt like such a fun way for the audience to be like, “well, yeah, if you're going to become a superstar, who better to party with than Nic Cage?” It just set the tone for a lot of Charlie's behaviors to come.


DEADLINE It's extraordinary that you got his old drug dealer Marco to talk. I had many questions about how he cleaned up the crack at the end to help Charlie get sober.


RENZI Apparently it's just extra baking soda every time. Not to give too much of an infomercial on how to cook crack, but you mix baking soda and cocaine together and you create crack. So he just kept making more and more with baking soda. Eventually there was just no crack, no cocaine in it. Charlie was just smoking baking soda.


DEADLINE I can't believe you had video of the moment when Charlie found out he was fired from Two and a Half Men.


RENZI One of the guys who was following Charlie around a lot was a paparazzo. Eventually Charlie was like, “listen, you're jumping out of bushes all the time on me. Just come with me.” And he ended up working for him and being a videographer for him at all times. This guy ended up with Charlie at the worst time of his life. Charlie was like, “oh my God. There was a guy with a camera there the whole time. We got to find the footage.” No one knew if it existed anymore. It turned out to be in a storage unit in Colorado or something, and this guy just handed it over to me and allowed us to use it. 


DEADLINE What was it like to listen to him discuss how his time on Two and a Half Men went up in flames? 


RENZI It was a pretty unique experience. It was a little bit of like, “oh my God, was that me?” I think of all the things, having to look back at that moment in his life was the hardest. He really struggled with his behavior, the aggression, the sort of feeling like he was being a bully. He's not a bully. He's not that guy. I think it was hard for him to say how he treated Chuck Lorre, how he treated Jon Cryer, how he talked about things on the air, how he came at people. I think that made him feel the ick probably more than anything. I think shame is a thing that will haunt anybody who has experiences they're not proud of. He didn't make this documentary as an amends because he's been living those amends for the past eight years. 


DEADLINE Why do you think Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez declined to participate?


RENZI I actually watched the movie with them, so I got to sit next to Martin while he watched. It was one of the most intimidating moments of my life, but it was really just a function of Martin feeling as though Charlie's message to his father was so present and maybe more available than him sitting for an interview. I don't know if Martin wanted to sit down with me and relive all of that stuff. He felt like, this is Charlie's moment to tell his story. You don't need me. I respected the heck out of that. I mean, that's a dad who really wants to just look out for his son and himself. And then Emilio, it just felt like he saw this as Charlie's moment and Charlie was able to finally tell his story the way that he wanted to tell it. None of that ended up being controversial. Everyone was open about the communication. Those guys are minutes from each other, probably seeing each other on a weekly, daily basis. And so it was nice for me to know that it had nothing to do with whatever perceived rift there might be. It was quite the opposite. It was because of the love they all have for each other.

	











DEADLINE Do you think Charlie can truly explain why he's an addict? Do you think he's totally self-aware? 


RENZI My perspective is he is arguably, at least from a public figure perspective, the biggest emblem of an addict that's still alive. He went as deep as you can go without dying. For the past eight years, he was not only just figuring that out for himself, but not trying to do the thing that he had always done … that's to re-enter the public conversation, get another role. He truly went away to figure this out. And that's pretty rare. Eight years is a heck of a stretch for anyone to go and reconcile with those things. So I'd have to say yes. I felt like when I was sitting across from him, I always thought, this is a person who's honest, who maybe isn't going to give everybody what they want, but he's here and he's present and he's telling his own truth. That to me is a very specific type of success story.


DEADLINE Did you enjoy talking to him?


RENZI He's hilarious. For a story that could be this dark, what a gift to be able to recount some of these things, but with a tone that doesn't need to be wildly investigative and uncomfortable and unsettling. I felt privileged.

Bill Maher addressed the shooting death of right-wing activist and Trump ally Charlie Kirk during his Real Time episode on Friday. His guests, The Daily Wire founder Ben Shapiro and The Atlantic writer Tim Alberta, also discussed the topic.


	“It's a very ugly week in America with violence of all kinds: political violence, regular violence, a lot of people talking about a civil war. And then today in Congress, because Charlie Kirk got assassinated, [Colorado Rep.] Lauren Boebert stood up and said, ‘We need to have a prayer.' So, they started to have a silent prayer. And then she started screaming, ‘No! Silent prayers get silent results.' As if praying out loud gets big results,” Maher said during his monologue, via Variety. “Then the Democrats started screaming at her that there was a school shooting in her state. I tell you, so far, the civil war is not very civil.”


	Maher also took President Trump to task for his remarks as political divisiveness continues to ramp up in the aftermath of Kirk's death. “Today, they asked the President, ‘What are you going to do to bring the country together?' And he said, ‘I know this is going to get me in trouble, but I could care less,” Maher said, eliciting laughter from the audience. “He's a different kind of cat. His message is, ‘Let the healing stop.'”  

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	During Maher's discussion with his guests, Shapiro noted the disparity of viewpoints among Gen Z when it comes to violent reactions to speech. He said that a poll revealed “only 57 percent of Gen Z say there is no excuse for violence in response to speech.”

	











	“There are at least 42 percent that believe that there are some times that the violence ought to be a response to speech, which is deeply terrifying,” Shapiro continued. “I never, honest to God, thought that we were going to get to this point. Even the assassination of political figures is not the same thing as just being shot in the throat for the crime of debating issues in the public square. And I thought wrong.”

	Alberta, a self-described “sparring partner from a distance” to Kirk, commented that “the response to this has not been shock and horror and a reversal of the trend line in these polls. If anything, it seems as though — particularly to Ben's point among younger voters — that this is becoming mainstreamed and becoming acceptable.”


	“The governor of the state said, ‘Social media is a cancer,' which I think is true. When you read some of the comments from people, they really are in such a bubble that they don't understand that it's happening on both sides,” Maher said. “The only way this starts to get better is if both sides admit, ‘OK, let's not have this debate about who started it. Let's not debate about who's worse because, plainly, both sides do it now.' And the right has done it too. A lot.”


	The suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old from Utah, was taken into custody on Friday. Trump announced the news Friday morning on Fox, saying that “they have the person they wanted,” and that he just heard about it “five minutes before I walked in.” On Real Time, Maher and Shapiro also debated about reporting on the speculative political viewpoints of the suspected shooter.


	“We do know that this kid was of the political left,” Shapiro began, citing reports from Tablet Magazine and The Guardian, which walked back its report on Sept. 12 with an editor's note. The Guardian's note reads: “Editor's note: This article was updated on 12 September 2025 to remove quotes after the verified source who attended high school with Tyler Robinson said after publication that they could not accurately remember details of their relationship.”

	Maher presciently responded: “It's two days out. We don't know shit. The internet is undefeated in getting it wrong to begin with.”


	Kirk — who was a guest on Maher's Club Random podcast in April — was the co-founder of Turning Point USA, which was formed to foster a culture of conservatism on school campuses around the nation. He was fatally shot Wednesday while speaking to students at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.

The Cincinnati Bengals quarterback established the Joe Burrow Foundation in 2022.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


NFL star Joe Burrow's charitable organization has removed a board member over his remarks addressing the murder of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.


	Hamilton County municipal court Judge Ted Berry, who was first elected to serve Cincinnati and the surrounding areas in 2005, has faced criticism for messages that he posted to Facebook after Kirk was gunned down at a Utah Valley University event on Wednesday. Among Berry's comments were “Rest in Hatred & Division!” and “How's he feel about gun violence & gun control in Hell, now?” as published by local outlets including the Cincinnati Enquirer.

	The Joe Burrow Foundation announced Friday that a board member had been removed, although the individual was not named. “We have terminated an advisory board member that made inappropriate remarks in light of recent events and they are no longer associated with the Foundation,” read the group's statement. “Their comments do not reflect our values or our mission.”


	In a statement to the Enquirer, Berry said he does not condone violence. “I regret if I caused division,” he said. “That was not my intent. And I hope there can be peace.”

	The Facebook comments led State Rep. Adam Mathews, a Republican for the district that includes the Ohio cities of Lebanon and Mason, to deem the remarks “shocking and completely unacceptable” and call for Berry's resignation in a statement released Friday. Berry, whom the Hamilton County Democratic Party endorsed, has previously said he will retire in January when his term ends.

	











	Burrow, who plays quarterback for the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals, is the president and founder of the Joe Burrow Foundation. The charity was established in 2022 to help children dealing with mental health issues and food insecurity. 


	Other public figures have faced criticism over comments made following the murder of the 31-year-old conservative commentator and Turning Point USA co-founder. MSNBC fired political analyst Matthew Dowd for on-air comments about Kirk, while Stephen King has apologized for a tweet about him.

"Today's agreement is a reminder of what can be achieved when people come together in the spirit of fairness and solidarity," organizers said.

	Organizers of Farm Aid 40 have confirmed that this year's festival will proceed as planned at the University of Minnesota, following a resolution between the university's administration and striking workers.


	On Saturday (Sept. 13), Farm Aid organizers announced on social media that the annual event will be held at Minneapolis' Huntington Bank Stadium on Sept. 20, after the university and Teamsters Local 320 reached a labor agreement.

	











	“Farm Aid is grateful that the University of Minnesota and Teamsters Local 320 have reached an agreement,” organizers wrote on Instagram. “We are thrilled to confirm that Farm Aid 40 will go forward in Minneapolis as planned.”


	They continued, “For four decades, Farm Aid has stood with farmers and workers. Today's agreement is a reminder of what can be achieved when people come together in the spirit of fairness and solidarity.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The 2025 edition of Farm Aid — marking the festival's 40th anniversary — will feature headliners Willie Nelson, Neil Young, John Mellencamp, Dave Matthews, Kenny Chesney, Margo Price and Billy Strings, among others. The event is expected to draw a crowd of approximately 50,000 fans.


	“We look forward to celebrating that spirit on September 20 — alongside farmers, workers, advocates, artists and fans — in a day of music and community that honors this shared history,” the statement concluded.

	











	The labor dispute had cast uncertainty over the event in recent weeks. On Friday (Sept. 12), Farm Aid revealed that Nelson, the festival's co-founder and president, had personally spoken with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in an effort to help resolve the situation.


	“I spoke with @mngovernor, and I'm grateful that he understands what's at stake for farmers and Farm Aid,” Nelson said in a statement on Instagram. “His involvement is very appreciated. We both know that, ultimately, it's up to the University to do the right thing, and soon, so that Farm Aid 40 can go forward.”


	Farm Aid first announced the location for its 40th anniversary concert in May, naming the University of Minnesota as host. But on Sept. 4, members of Teamsters Local 320 — which represents public sector employees including custodial, maintenance, food service and sanitation staff — voted to reject a proposed contract extension. The union went on strike days later.


	Crews were set to begin building the festival infrastructure on Sept. 12. Prior to the agreement, organizers acknowledged the difficulty of relocating the event at such a late stage.


	“It is critical to understand that if Farm Aid 40 is forced to move or cancel, the financial impact could be devastating,” organizers said in a previous statement to Billboard. “The expenses already incurred to bring this historic event to Minnesota may well threaten the survival of our organization after four decades of service to family farmers.”


	“We urge the University of Minnesota to settle this contract quickly so that Farm Aid 40 can proceed as intended — to celebrate four decades of farmers, music, and solidarity. The world is watching, and together we can make sure this anniversary is remembered for unity, not division.”

	











	Since being founded in 1985, Farm Aid has raised more than $85 million “to promote a strong and resilient family farm system of agriculture,” according to its website.

“Calle Malaga” opens with title cards explaining to the audience the history of Tangier's Spanish population: How, as Spain fell to fascism under Francisco Franco's rule in the 1930s people fled to the Northwest Moroccan city, and a community of Spanish speakers blossomed and grew over the decades. It's an overly didactic touch that conveys little beyond what Carmen Maura's performance as Maria, an elderly woman living alone in Tangier, already tells the audience. 

Making her way through the streets of her neighborhood, shopping for groceries and warmly greeting her neighbors, Maura makes it obvious that Maria adores her quiet, content life in this city where she grew up. And, when Maria's daughter Clara (Marta Etura) arrives to drop a bombshell — that she needs to sell the family home, and Maria must either come with her to Madrid or live the remainder of her life in a nursing community — the way Maura's face flashes from devastation and horror to anger and steel makes it all too clear how hard she'll fight to maintain this life.

The third feature of director Maryam Touzani, “Calle Malaga” strikes chords similar to her acclaimed sophomore feature “The Blue Caftan” in its exploration of the romantic, domestic life of someone well past middle-age. Touzani based the character of Maria in part on her own Spanish grandmother, and she gives Maura — a great actress best known to American audiences for her work in Pedro Almodóvar movies like “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown” and “Volver” — a wonderful part to embody. Maria is a wonderfully textured character, at turns flinty and cold and vivacious and funny, and Maura is adept at embodying all sides to this woman. However, the movie around her proves a lot less interesting than it's main character. Frequently safe and only skimming the surface of the complicated emotions its premise raises, “Calle Malaga” is likable but never quite interesting.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Warmly shot with sun-draped lenses by Virginie Surdej and soundtracked by an overbearingly sentimental score by Freya Arde, “Calle Malaga” introduces the threat on Maria's house as a tragedy before quickly pivoting to a more cheery, sentimental story, one in which the woman finds community and even love through the hardship. Crafty and resistant, Maria agrees to go to the retirement center and let Clara put the house on the market and return to her family in Madrid. With her daughter off her back, she fakes a trip to see her to leave the center and heads back to squat in her unoccupied former home, eventually teaming up with a young neighbor to host football-viewing parties in the space as a way to scrounge up money. It also helps her buy back her old furniture from handsome antiques dealer Abslam (Ahmed Boulane), with whom she sparks a tentative romance. 

The romantic subplot proves the most charming thread “Calle Malaga” has to offer, thanks to Maura and Boulane's performances. There's a wistful sense of longing between them even before things turn explicitly romantic, and for a relatively tame and breezy film it does get genuinely hot in its depiction of their relationship. In other areas, however, the script from Touzani and her husband and producer Nabil Ayouch falters in the way it fills out the people surrounding Maria. Her best friend Josefena (María Alfonsa Rosso), a nun who has taken a vow of silence, is more a device through which Maria can spew her feelings and inner thoughts than a fully-formed person. Occasionally their interactions work to funny effect, like when she extolls Abslam's performance in bed to her silent friend, but the film stumbles when it tries to build real emotional stakes around their bond.

 










Faring even worse is Clara, thinly rendered as an ungrateful child and an obstacle for her mother. Although she's introduced with very valid reasons for selling the apartment — she just went through a divorce, she's struggling financially, she needs the money to buy a new home for her kids — “Calle Malaga” has little interest in giving her real interiority or taking her concerns seriously. Her strained relationship with her mother has little nuance, and the unsatisfying, abrupt ending that leaves the two still at odds proves curiously sour for an otherwise gentle movie.    

Lack of nuance plagues “Calle Malaga” in general, and it's particularly apparent in how thin the neighborhood Maria loves so dearly actually is on screen. The cobblestone step streets are pleasing on the eye, but the people who inhabit this community and rally to help Maria don't have much character to speak of. There's little sense of what her life in this city, as a Spanish woman around mostly Moroccans, looks like. Despite the film's introductory text, most of “Calle Malaga” could happen in any city in the world. Without Maura's performance, there'd be no specificity to speak of.

“Calle Malaga” premiered at the Venice Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Bill Maher began his monologue on Real Time with Bill Maher by denouncing a “very ugly week in America” following the assassination of far-right political activist Charlie Kirk. 


	As audiences applauded his entrance, the host thanked viewers for “coming on a somewhat difficult week” and noted at the extended clapping, “I hope that's for what I think it's for — because I've always been someone who wants to talk to people.”


	“It's a very ugly week in America with violence of all kinds: political violence, regular violence, a lot of people talking about a civil war,” Maher continued. “And then today in Congress, because Charlie Kirk got assassinated, [Colorado Representative] Lauren Boebert stood up and said, ‘We need to have a prayer.' So they started to have a silent prayer. And then she started screaming, ‘No! Silent prayers get silent results.' As if praying out loud gets big results. So then the Democrats started screaming at her that there was a school shooting in her state. I tell you, so far, the civil war is not very civil.”

	Maher went on to say that the alleged shooter, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was a “stay-at-home son.”

	“They said he acted alone,” Maher joked, “I'm sure this is not the only thing he does alone.”


	Speaking to president Donald Trump's recent comments on what should be done to bridge the stark partisan divide in the nation, the host said, “Today, they asked the president, ‘What are you going to do to bring the country together?' And he said, ‘I know this is going to get me in trouble, but I could care less.' He's a different kind of cat. His message is, ‘Let the healing stop,'” drawing wan laughs.

	











	Later in the episode, which featured guests Charlie Sheen, fellow ultra-conservative personality Ben Shapiro and The Atlantic staff writer Tim Alberta, Maher added, “I like everybody, I talk to everybody, I'm glad I took that approach. But he was shot under a banner that said, ‘Prove me wrong,' because he was a debater, and too many people think that the way to do that — to prove you wrong — is to just eliminate you from talking altogether. So the people who mocked his death or justified it, I think you're gross. I have no use for you. The people who are saying now we're at war, I've no use for you.”


	Kirk, one of the most prominent organizers on the right, particularly in collegiate life via his Turning Point USA organization, was addressing thousands of college students at an outdoor event held at Utah Valley University when he was shot in the neck. About two hours later, Trump announced his death on Truth Social. The president said on Thursday that he would award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 


	A divisive figure for his espousal of Christian Nationalism, who had called the passage of the Civil Rights Act a “huge mistake” and said that some gun-violence related deaths were “prudent” in order to secure the protection of the Second Amendment, though Kirk's death was swiftly condemned by political officials past and present — from Democratic New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani to former president Barack Obama — some online, as Maher mentioned, did not have a lot of empathy for his killing, invoking the late pundit's own words that “empathy is a made-up, new age term that … does a lot of damage.”


	Political violence has risen in the U.S. in recent years, with Kirk's shooting coming just months after the assassination of Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the shooting of a state senator and his wife and the firebombing of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence.

Life coach and former MTV star Kelley Wolf is facing a new legal hurdle, according to court documents obtained by multiple outlets on September 12, 2025. According to People, the estranged wife of actor Scott Wolf, whose most recent roles have been on FOX's “Doc” and Hallmark's “A Merry Scottish Christmas,” was charged with a new misdemeanor over accusations that she tried to contact one of their three kids. 

Despite a temporary protective order filed on August 28 that barred Kelley from “any direct or indirect contact” with Scott or their three kids, a new court filing claims she tried to reach her 12-year-old son via a friend's phone two days later, per Us Weekly. 

This new charge is on top of three misdemeanors Kelley was charged with after her August 26 arrest — “one count of electronic communication harassment and two counts of electronic disclosure of personal identifying information,” according to TMZ. On September 12, Kelley told People in a statement that she was “utterly shocked” by the latest charge. 

Scott, who was granted sole physical custody of his and Kelley's kids in late June, filed a Statement of Probable Cause, People reported, claiming that Kelley contacted him on August 30 by “using a friend's phone and attempting to contact her son through a friend's son.” A summons for Kelley to appear in court on November 7 was also filed, per Us Weekly.

Regarding facing her fourth charge, Kelley said in an exclusive statement to People on September 12, “I am utterly shocked (for) the unabating aggressive use of a legal system and possibly more.”

Kelley then wrote, “(It) has become almost intolerable to my physical body, my family's health and well-being period. I'm unclear as to how these things are allowed to be processed. I have (allegedly) been compliant with everything legal, I have said nothing disparaging about anyone at any time.” 

“I'd like to also state for anyone who doesn't seem to understand,” she continued, “that divorce can take time. Anyone who continues to put pressure on a mother when all she's doing is fighting for her children is somebody who needs to check themselves.”

After Kelley's arrest, one of the conditions of her release was that she “participate in inpatient or outpatient medical, behavior, psychological, or psychiatric treatment,” per TMZ. At her arraignment on September 2, Kelley said she was “looking forward to” entering a rehabilitation treatment center on September 12, according to People.

Kelley wound up going sooner, checking in on September 7, People reported. But one day later, the outlet revealed Kelley had already left and was staying at a hotel. 

The Wolfs then attended an emergency hearing on September 10, requested by Scott because, he said, Kelley had continued to disregard court orders. But when Kelley arrived with no legal representation, the judge refused to make any new rulings and ordered that Kelley return a few weeks later, on October 23, with a new attorney (her former lawyer dropped her as a client, per Page Six). The judge also ordered that Scott pay for some of her legal fees. 

On September 11, Kelley returned to Instagram, posting several Stories reviewed by EntertainmentNow. In one, she shared a photo of a Utah rehab facility billed as a “luxury addiction treatment center.” Above it, she wrote, “Great place for PTSD recovery.” 

Kelley also shared a video from Roar Africa, a luxury African safari company she's traveled with before. Beneath the reel, she wrote, “Goodness me @roarafrica I have been doing all I can to come to you ha ha ha Let's go my loves! The buffalo are calling to my soul!”

A post shared by Scott Wolf (@iamscottwolf)

Kelley, who was on MTV's “Real World: New Orleans” and “The Challenge,” was married to Scott for 21 years before announcing their impending divorce on June 10. 

She has since been placed under two involuntary holds by police, including one three days after her divorce announcement. Her August arrest stemmed from a slew of social media posts in which police said she disclosed others' personal information, including one with Scott's phone number, per Us Weekly.

On August 15, Scott broke his silence after a summer of hardships, telling People that his “continued hope is to have this most difficult chapter of our family's lives remain as private as possible, however, the well being of my children is at stake, and that will always be my priority.”

The actor added, “There are some significant challenges that are making our situation incredibly difficult and contentious, and it is tragic for all involved.”

SATURDAY AM: Forget about the biggest anime opening of all-time stateside, that's easy. What Sony has is their biggest opening of not just 2025 to date, but also arguably bigger than any of its hits last year in Crunchyroll's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle which stands to open to $56M-$60M+ after a massive $33M Friday.


	Given the front-loaded nature of anime movies, sources are forecasting that Saturday drops about 41% against that Friday/previews number for a $19.5M take today. That said, there are some out there who believe this castle could spiral upward to the heavens to a $70M take.

	











Infinity Castle not only outstrips this year's start of Sony's 28 Years Later ($30M), but it's bigger than last year's Venom: The Last Dance ($51M), It Ends With Us ($50M) and likely Bad Boys: Ride or Die ($56.5M). The last big opening for Sony was June 2023's Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse with $120.6M. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Talk about a secret weapon that no one noticed — and by that we mean, like, two months ago. It wasn't apparent Sony had a killer swordsman at the B.O. until advance tickets went on sale, notching an anime record (over 5 days) with $10M for the top three circuits. For those who don't know what a Demon Slayer is, such as myself, I'm told the je ne sais quoi magnetism of this movie for fans is that it stands as a pivotal point in the franchise; essentially, it's Empire Strikes Back. CinemaScore audience gave the movie a solid A, the best grade recorded by the exit poll firm for a Demon Slayer movie (the 2023 and 2024 editions receiving B+s).

	











	The other magic trick with these Crunchyroll movies is that it doesn't take much media spend to pull in this audience, with the label knowing where to reach the faithful, head on.


	iSpot shows that Sony spent very little in linear ($74K) next to Lionsgate's $3.5M shell out to promote The Long Walk and Focus Features' $5.7M spend for Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale. Sony's linear campaign reached 17M TV ad impressions, as opposed to Long Walk‘s 159M and Downton Abbey‘s 962M. Sony ran spots for Infinity Castle on TBS, Adult Swim and TNT on shows such as WWE Friday Night Smackdown, AEW Dynamite, AEW Collision, Futurama and Dragon Ball DAIMA.


	PLFs and Imax are repping a huge 44% of Infinity Castle‘s weekend with an even play across the country, but best in the West. The Regal Irvine Spectrum has already racked up close to $100K (wow). Huge turnout by Hispanic and Latino audiences at 37%, followed by 27% Caucasian, 16% Black and 14% Asian. 57% overall male skew. The movie has already broken local opening records abroad for an anime movie with an overall foreign total of $350M per The Numbers, the bulk of that from Japan.


	Together, Infinity Castle, which is pulling in 71% among 18-34 moviegoers, and the second weekend of Conjuring: Last Rites ($27M in second) are eating Long Walk‘s lunch which is pulling in 61% with 18-34 with $11M-$12.5M in fourth place. Infinity Castle also has, inside its walls, the under 25 demo at 48% as opposed to Long Walk‘s 29%. Infinity Castle planted its flag on the schedule first, quite evident in March and Lionsgate followed with The Long Walk dating its release back in April. In hindsight, Long Walk should have taken a hike to another weekend, but again, no one knew how big Demon Slayer would be. That said, the opening here for Long Walk is just below that of other recent Stephen King movie adaptations, this year's Monkey ($14M) and 2019's Doctor Sleep ($14.1M). Lionsgate calculators, which budgeted this movie at a net $20M, had to take those comps into account. Despite having the tagline “The Task Is Simple: Walk or Die,” no one is running out in Red Army numbers to watch this death walk movie about young men versus the Man. Despite having Hunger Games‘ Francis Lawrence's name on the pic as director, and rising genre scribe JT Mollner, the pic stars plenty of fresh faces and carries what looks to be an anti-military message in its trailers, which is bound to upset the middle of the country. That said, the movie's best areas of play are the East, Midwest and West. AMC Burbank is the top grossing venue at $23K. There's a handful of PLFs, but they're not doing much. Diversity demos were 55% Caucasian, 18% Latino and Hispanic, 17% Black and 7% Asian.


	That said, Focus Features' decision to open Downton Abbey: Grand Finale as counterprogramming to the young kid movies is a genius distribution release maneuver, the threequel's opening at $19.5M in third is already higher than the series previous title, New Era ($16M). The studios don't counterprogram enough to opposing demo movies: You can't just date 'em on the calendar, but you have to put some marketing heft behind such titles to open them to a respectable level like we're seeing here. Over 55 here is a great 56% with an overall heavy female skew of 72%, on par with other Downton movies. Grand Finale lands the third straight A for a Downton Abbey movie. Grand Finale isn't just a big city movie or one for the coasts, but is attracting those in the East, South, Midwest and Mountain regions with AMC Lincoln Square the top grossing venue with just over $31K. 

	











	Not doing well at all unfortunately is Bleecker Street's release of Rob Reiner's Spinal Tap II: The End Continues which is opening to around $1.55M at 1,920 theaters — not very good for a wide release with a per theater of $807. Too bad, as there was a lot of Hollywood love for this movie the other night at its Tuesday premiere with a standing ovation from Jack Black, Jay Roach, Nick Kroll, Jim Gianopulos, Billy Crystal and more. Note that this was a distribution deal for Bleecker Street, which is only on the hook for P&A. Reiner's Spinal Tap spurred the Christopher Guest 1990s-into-early aughts revolution of mockumentaries, which were always arthouse plays, mostly platform releases. The top opening for a Guest mockumentary was 2003's A Mighty Wind with $2.1M at — get this — 133 theaters. It's unfortunate that nowadays it takes more screens to get about the same size gross for a specialty release like this. The overall play here, like the original 1984 movie, This Is Spinal Tap, is home ancillary. That's where Spinal Tap cultivated its generations of followers. The few who showed up, of course fans, gave it an A-. Seventy-four percent guys, with those over 45 at 60%, meaning the franchise's core Gen X and older. Caucasians were 83% followed by 8% Latino and Hispanic, 5% Asian and 1% Black.


	The entire marketplace is coming in around $147M for all movies, +57% of the same frame a year ago when Beetlejuice Beetlejuice pulled in a second frame of $51.3M. 


FRIDAY AFTERNOON: Sony/Crunchyroll's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle is a beast with the town gonzo over box office forecasts. On the conservative side, it's looking like a $28 million Friday (including $11.4M previews) and a $45M three-day cume at 3,315 theaters, which is a definite record opening for anime movie.


	However, there are others who believe Friday is around $35M (including previews), with a $60M-plus weekend in store. 


	The lower forecasts stem from the philosophy that the audience for this movie is niche-focused, limited to Demon Slayer devotees, and that no audience expansion is possible. While the last Demon Slayer opened to north of $21M and came out when theaters were reopening from the pandemic in the spring of 2021, Dragon Ball Super: Super Broly (which posted a similar opening), saw a -46% drop in its Saturday with $5.8M next to its $10.9M Friday. Marketing has been quite thrifty on this anime movie, on par with other Crunchyroll titles. That's the other amaze-amaze about this movie.


Conjuring: Last Rites from New Line/Warner Bros, per estimates, is coming in at $29.7M at 3,802 locations, which is where we saw it. That would make it off 65% for a running 10-day total by Sunday of $134.6M, very close to topping the original movie's cume, which is the franchise's highest at $137.4M.


	Third belongs to Focus Features' Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale, which has a shot at $20M but right now is at $19.5M in third at 3,694 sites. That is higher than the bow of 2022's previous chapter New Era after a $9.2M Friday (including $2.6M previews).

	











	Fourth is Lionsgate's The Long Walk at 2,815, looking at $11M-$13.5M after a $5M Friday. The movie, which largely stars a fresh-faced cast, was made for net $20M.


	Disney's 30th anniversary rerelease of Pixar's Toy Story is eyeing $1M today for a $3.4M weekend in estimates at 2,375 theaters.


FRIDAY AM, AFTER EXCLUSIVE: Previews for Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle came in at $11.4 million. That's a record for an anime movie, beating 2022's Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero which did $4.3M in previews before a $10.9M Friday and $21.1M opening. By the way, that figure for Infinity Castle is for both Tuesday fan and Thursday night shows.


	RelishMix counts 200 million followers in the Infinity Castle social media universe across TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and X. No surprise that chatter is positive given that RT audience score Thursday night, which continues to stand at 99%. “Hype centers on animation and Zenitsu/Akaza moments; with comments exclaiming ‘The animation is peak' and ‘Zenitsu is LOCKED THE HELL IN' and ‘Absolute mf cinema.' Event behavior is strong with fans exclaiming how they've booked tickets at full capacity theaters, and calling the trailer ‘godlike' as well as shoutouts to the LiSA and Aimer theme songs.”


	Focus Features' Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale counted $2.6M in all previews from Wednesday and Thursday at 2,900 venues. Wednesday paid sneak previews alone on large-format screens were $1M.


	Lionsgate's The Long Walk came in at $1.3M. Audience reaction on RT audience score is good at 86%.


	Again, this weekend is expected to be the best mid-September frame at the box office for all movies post-Covid, exceeding $100M and besting the $93.7M from the same frame a year ago. New Line's The Conjuring: Last Rites posted $3.3M on Thursday, -23% for a first week of $104.9M.


EXCLUSIVE: Sony/Crunchyroll's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle, as we knew all along, is having a great night, with preview estimates at $10M at 2,800 sites, maybe a little more by sunrise. Showtimes, boosted by Imax and PLFs, began at 4 p.m.


	That amount of cash is about equal to the pic's first five days of advance ticket sales, which by the way, repped a record for an anime movie. 


	That Thursday night figure is almost as much as Five Nights at Freddy's previews ($10.3M in 2023), it's $500K less than Oppenheimer‘s ($10.5M, 2023) and higher than last fall's Joker: Folie à Deux ($7M). Not that those are any hard comps; it's just interesting to juxtapose the amount of cash this anime pic is racking up. Why are fans rushing to see this movie? Because it's the first in a trilogy. The record opening for anime movie belongs to Warner Bros' Pokémon: The First Movie, which debuted to $31M in 1999.


	As we mentioned, Infinity Castle‘s weekend will be very frontloaded. Sony has forecast $35M for the opening of the Haruo Sotozaki-directed movie, while other sources believe the anime title's opening lies between $45M-$60M over Friday-Sunday. Critics on Rotten Tomatoes are 96% fresh from 27 reviews, while the audience score stands at 99%.


	As we told you in the preview, it's going to be a deep bench of a weekend with New Line's The Conjuring: Last Rites banking potentially another $29M in its second frame, and newcomers Focus Features' Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale and Lionsgate's The Long Walk doing $15M-$20M and $10M, respectively. Last Rites crossed $100M on Wednesday and is bound to be the highest-grossing Conjuring movie ever at the domestic B.O., surpassing the 2013 original's $137.4M total.


	Also opening is Bleecker Street's Spinal Tap II: The End Continues with an expected $3M-$5M; critics currently 74% fresh on the Rob Reiner-directed sequel again starring Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer.


The Long Walk, based on the Stephen King tome about a group of teenage boys who compete in an annual contest where they must maintain a certain walking speed or get shot, is bound for a $1.2M-$1.5M Thursday. The Francis Lawrence-directed movie is at 94% fresh with critics.

	











Downton Abbey 3, we're hearing, is north of $1M for the night, which is about what the previous installment, 2022's Downton Abbey: The New Era did, turning into a $7.3M Friday and $16M opening. The original movie during pre-Covid September 2019 minted a $2.1M Thursday night on its way to a $13.8M Friday and $31M opening. The threequel currently has the best reviews in the trilogy with 88% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and a near-best audience score of 96%, just behind New Era's 97%.

As a GenX music fan, I've always adored Spinal Tap ever since my first view in the early 1990s. I've seen it dozens of times, BUT it was always on a second generation VHS tape on a picture tube tv. I've never even watched it on a flat screen. That was the nature of the beast back then – dubbing tapes and trading them with friends.

If only those comedians at the premiere were actually in the movie instead of a bunch of musicians who aren't funny.

It is not empire strikes back, the trilogy adapts the end of the story unlike most anime films based on a franchise, where they just tell a story unrelated to the plot of the original anime series.

Maybe Hollywood can learn from recent releases?

Cheap movies like Weapons, The Conjuring and Demon Slayer overperforming while expensive movies like Superman, Brave New World, Thunderbolts, Mission Impossible, Fantastic Four, Elio and Snow White underperform and flop in theaters.

Conjuring at $55 million and Weapons at $42 million aren't that cheap.

They are far cheaper than any Marvel/DC fare which usually budget from 150-200mil, also the MI franchise…

So what's the lesson? Is it economical or creative?

It will probably be the first movie I see in theaters in two years.   Definitely want to see it in IMAX or Dolby Cinema.   I mean what's the audience size, it's one of the most popular anime/manga.  I think it would be way more popular than any TV spin off show available now, except from another manga.  And this is the final arc and it's basically just a continuation of the show. It was an incredible build-up for this final confrontation in the last episode, last year.  So this is required viewing for fans of the show.

I can agree that there is a limit because the audience will have to be caught up with what is going on.  But don't underestimate the audience size.

Huge turnout by Hispanic and Latino audiences at 37%, followed by 27% Caucasian, 16% Black and 14% Asian. 57% overall male skew. The movie has already broken local opening records abroad for an anime movie with an overall foreign total of $350M per The Numbers, the bulk of that from Japan.


	Together, Infinity Castle, which is pulling in 71% among 18-34 moviegoers, and the second weekend of Conjuring: Last Rites ($27M in second) are eating Long Walk‘s lunch which is pulling in 61% with 18-34 with $11M-$12.5M in fourth place. Infinity Castle also has, inside its walls, the under 25 demo at 48% as opposed to Long Walk‘s 29%. Infinity Castle planted its flag on the schedule first, quite evident in March and Lionsgate followed with The Long Walk dating its release back in April. In hindsight, Long Walk should have taken a hike to another weekend, but again, no one knew how big Demon Slayer would be. That said, the opening here for Long Walk is just below that of other recent Stephen King movie adaptations, this year's Monkey ($14M) and 2019's Doctor Sleep ($14.1M). Lionsgate calculators, which budgeted this movie at a net $20M, had to take those comps into account. Despite having the tagline “The Task Is Simple: Walk or Die,” no one is running out in Red Army numbers to watch this death walk movie about young men versus the Man. Despite having Hunger Games‘ Francis Lawrence's name on the pic as director, and rising genre scribe JT Mollner, the pic stars plenty of fresh faces and carries what looks to be an anti-military message in its trailers, which is bound to upset the middle of the country. That said, the movie's best areas of play are the East, Midwest and West. AMC Burbank is the top grossing venue at $23K. There's a handful of PLFs, but they're not doing much. Diversity demos were 55% Caucasian, 18% Latino and Hispanic, 17% Black and 7% Asian.


	That said, Focus Features' decision to open Downton Abbey: Grand Finale as counterprogramming to the young kid movies is a genius distribution release maneuver, the threequel's opening at $19.5M in third is already higher than the series previous title, New Era ($16M). The studios don't counterprogram enough to opposing demo movies: You can't just date 'em on the calendar, but you have to put some marketing heft behind such titles to open them to a respectable level like we're seeing here. Over 55 here is a great 56% with an overall heavy female skew of 72%, on par with other Downton movies. Grand Finale lands the third straight A for a Downton Abbey movie. Grand Finale isn't just a big city movie or one for the coasts, but is attracting those in the East, South, Midwest and Mountain regions with AMC Lincoln Square the top grossing venue with just over $31K. 


	Not doing well at all unfortunately is Bleecker Street's release of Rob Reiner's Spinal Tap II: The End Continues which is opening to around $1.55M at 1,920 theaters — not very good for a wide release with a per theater of $807. Too bad, as there was a lot of Hollywood love for this movie the other night at its Tuesday premiere with a standing ovation from Jack Black, Jay Roach, Nick Kroll, Jim Gianopulos, Billy Crystal and more. Note that this was a distribution deal for Bleecker Street, which is only on the hook for P&A. Reiner's Spinal Tap spurred the Christopher Guest 1990s-into-early aughts revolution of mockumentaries, which were always arthouse plays, mostly platform releases. The top opening for a Guest mockumentary was 2003's A Mighty Wind with $2.1M at — get this — 133 theaters. It's unfortunate that nowadays it takes more screens to get about the same size gross for a specialty release like this. The overall play here, like the original 1984 movie, This Is Spinal Tap, is home ancillary. That's where Spinal Tap cultivated its generations of followers. The few who showed up, of course fans, gave it an A-. Seventy-four percent guys, with those over 45 at 60%, meaning the franchise's core Gen X and older. Caucasians were 83% followed by 8% Latino and Hispanic, 5% Asian and 1% Black.

	











	The entire marketplace is coming in around $147M for all movies, +57% of the same frame a year ago when Beetlejuice Beetlejuice pulled in a second frame of $51.3M. 


FRIDAY AFTERNOON: Sony/Crunchyroll's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle is a beast with the town gonzo over box office forecasts. On the conservative side, it's looking like a $28 million Friday (including $11.4M previews) and a $45M three-day cume at 3,315 theaters, which is a definite record opening for anime movie.


	However, there are others who believe Friday is around $35M (including previews), with a $60M-plus weekend in store. 


	The lower forecasts stem from the philosophy that the audience for this movie is niche-focused, limited to Demon Slayer devotees, and that no audience expansion is possible. While the last Demon Slayer opened to north of $21M and came out when theaters were reopening from the pandemic in the spring of 2021, Dragon Ball Super: Super Broly (which posted a similar opening), saw a -46% drop in its Saturday with $5.8M next to its $10.9M Friday. Marketing has been quite thrifty on this anime movie, on par with other Crunchyroll titles. That's the other amaze-amaze about this movie.


Conjuring: Last Rites from New Line/Warner Bros, per estimates, is coming in at $29.7M at 3,802 locations, which is where we saw it. That would make it off 65% for a running 10-day total by Sunday of $134.6M, very close to topping the original movie's cume, which is the franchise's highest at $137.4M.


	Third belongs to Focus Features' Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale, which has a shot at $20M but right now is at $19.5M in third at 3,694 sites. That is higher than the bow of 2022's previous chapter New Era after a $9.2M Friday (including $2.6M previews).


	Fourth is Lionsgate's The Long Walk at 2,815, looking at $11M-$13.5M after a $5M Friday. The movie, which largely stars a fresh-faced cast, was made for net $20M.


	Disney's 30th anniversary rerelease of Pixar's Toy Story is eyeing $1M today for a $3.4M weekend in estimates at 2,375 theaters.


FRIDAY AM, AFTER EXCLUSIVE: Previews for Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle came in at $11.4 million. That's a record for an anime movie, beating 2022's Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero which did $4.3M in previews before a $10.9M Friday and $21.1M opening. By the way, that figure for Infinity Castle is for both Tuesday fan and Thursday night shows.


	RelishMix counts 200 million followers in the Infinity Castle social media universe across TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and X. No surprise that chatter is positive given that RT audience score Thursday night, which continues to stand at 99%. “Hype centers on animation and Zenitsu/Akaza moments; with comments exclaiming ‘The animation is peak' and ‘Zenitsu is LOCKED THE HELL IN' and ‘Absolute mf cinema.' Event behavior is strong with fans exclaiming how they've booked tickets at full capacity theaters, and calling the trailer ‘godlike' as well as shoutouts to the LiSA and Aimer theme songs.”


	Focus Features' Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale counted $2.6M in all previews from Wednesday and Thursday at 2,900 venues. Wednesday paid sneak previews alone on large-format screens were $1M.

	











	Lionsgate's The Long Walk came in at $1.3M. Audience reaction on RT audience score is good at 86%.


	Again, this weekend is expected to be the best mid-September frame at the box office for all movies post-Covid, exceeding $100M and besting the $93.7M from the same frame a year ago. New Line's The Conjuring: Last Rites posted $3.3M on Thursday, -23% for a first week of $104.9M.


EXCLUSIVE: Sony/Crunchyroll's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle, as we knew all along, is having a great night, with preview estimates at $10M at 2,800 sites, maybe a little more by sunrise. Showtimes, boosted by Imax and PLFs, began at 4 p.m.


	That amount of cash is about equal to the pic's first five days of advance ticket sales, which by the way, repped a record for an anime movie. 


	That Thursday night figure is almost as much as Five Nights at Freddy's previews ($10.3M in 2023), it's $500K less than Oppenheimer‘s ($10.5M, 2023) and higher than last fall's Joker: Folie à Deux ($7M). Not that those are any hard comps; it's just interesting to juxtapose the amount of cash this anime pic is racking up. Why are fans rushing to see this movie? Because it's the first in a trilogy. The record opening for anime movie belongs to Warner Bros' Pokémon: The First Movie, which debuted to $31M in 1999.


	As we mentioned, Infinity Castle‘s weekend will be very frontloaded. Sony has forecast $35M for the opening of the Haruo Sotozaki-directed movie, while other sources believe the anime title's opening lies between $45M-$60M over Friday-Sunday. Critics on Rotten Tomatoes are 96% fresh from 27 reviews, while the audience score stands at 99%.


	As we told you in the preview, it's going to be a deep bench of a weekend with New Line's The Conjuring: Last Rites banking potentially another $29M in its second frame, and newcomers Focus Features' Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale and Lionsgate's The Long Walk doing $15M-$20M and $10M, respectively. Last Rites crossed $100M on Wednesday and is bound to be the highest-grossing Conjuring movie ever at the domestic B.O., surpassing the 2013 original's $137.4M total.


	Also opening is Bleecker Street's Spinal Tap II: The End Continues with an expected $3M-$5M; critics currently 74% fresh on the Rob Reiner-directed sequel again starring Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer.


The Long Walk, based on the Stephen King tome about a group of teenage boys who compete in an annual contest where they must maintain a certain walking speed or get shot, is bound for a $1.2M-$1.5M Thursday. The Francis Lawrence-directed movie is at 94% fresh with critics.


Downton Abbey 3, we're hearing, is north of $1M for the night, which is about what the previous installment, 2022's Downton Abbey: The New Era did, turning into a $7.3M Friday and $16M opening. The original movie during pre-Covid September 2019 minted a $2.1M Thursday night on its way to a $13.8M Friday and $31M opening. The threequel currently has the best reviews in the trilogy with 88% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and a near-best audience score of 96%, just behind New Era's 97%.

As a GenX music fan, I've always adored Spinal Tap ever since my first view in the early 1990s. I've seen it dozens of times, BUT it was always on a second generation VHS tape on a picture tube tv. I've never even watched it on a flat screen. That was the nature of the beast back then – dubbing tapes and trading them with friends.

If only those comedians at the premiere were actually in the movie instead of a bunch of musicians who aren't funny.

It is not empire strikes back, the trilogy adapts the end of the story unlike most anime films based on a franchise, where they just tell a story unrelated to the plot of the original anime series.

Maybe Hollywood can learn from recent releases?

Cheap movies like Weapons, The Conjuring and Demon Slayer overperforming while expensive movies like Superman, Brave New World, Thunderbolts, Mission Impossible, Fantastic Four, Elio and Snow White underperform and flop in theaters.

Conjuring at $55 million and Weapons at $42 million aren't that cheap.

They are far cheaper than any Marvel/DC fare which usually budget from 150-200mil, also the MI franchise…

So what's the lesson? Is it economical or creative?

It will probably be the first movie I see in theaters in two years.   Definitely want to see it in IMAX or Dolby Cinema.   I mean what's the audience size, it's one of the most popular anime/manga.  I think it would be way more popular than any TV spin off show available now, except from another manga.  And this is the final arc and it's basically just a continuation of the show. It was an incredible build-up for this final confrontation in the last episode, last year.  So this is required viewing for fans of the show.

I can agree that there is a limit because the audience will have to be caught up with what is going on.  But don't underestimate the audience size.

	Does the release of Spinal Tap II: The End Continues mark the actual end of England's loudest band? Maybe, says Michael McKean, who plays David St. Hubbins: “If you only halfway exist, then vanishing altogether is not a big chore.” McKean, whose many other roles include Charles McGill on Better Call Saul and a recent Broadway stint in a Glengarry Glen Ross revival, recently hopped on a Zoom to talk four decades of Spinal Tap.


This is the first time you've done a full-length movie as Spinal Tap since the original. How did that feel?We got to work on it a few years ago and met every day. Some days we would completely waste. We'd get into talking about old show business and prehistoric TV, part of which was Harry [Shearer, who plays Derek Smalls]. Harry's been doing it since he was eight years old — he was on The Jack Benny Show. Chris [Guest] and I for somewhat less, but still we were the first generation of TV babies. We would waste as much time as we could, as long as there were snacks.

	











	Eventually we put together an idea for the notion of one more concert. The guys aren't speaking, but they're gonna be thrown together for one more concert. Originally the idea was Ian Faith's widow. We spoke with a few people. Kerry [Godliman] was obviously the best one, but she was way too young to be a widow. And she said, “How about I'm his daughter?” And we said, “Done.”How was the actual production different from the original film?It turned out to be a lot of fun. Shooting in New Orleans was a lot of fun. We certainly ate well. Some old pals came. But listen, it wasn't the same as the first one. The first one was film. And we would watch dailies every single day. We all saw the four-and-a-half-hour assembly. Then we saw the two-and-three-quarter-hour assembly, and then we saw the two-hour-10. We went through this kind of winnowing down process and we killed a few darlings and a couple of the ugly children that we knew probably weren't gonna make it anyway.

	But it was just a very different process. The first time we saw any kind of assemblage of the film was when Rob [Reiner, the director] put together his 90-minute version, and there were things missing. “Maybe we could bring that back.” So we did some of that, but we never saw a four hour version.

	











	We do explore what's happening to these personalities, as odd and raggedy as they are. We never wanted them to be cartoons. We really wanted 'em to be real people.

Did themes of aging and mortality seep into your own thinking?Oh, absolutely. There's that moment when [the character] Simon suggests that one of us die and that would really sell this thing, and we have to actually think about it. David St. Hubbins has said that rock & roll keeps you young, but only if you die young. Otherwise, you're just a regular old person.


How early did you start to see the absurd side of rock & roll?Kind of immediately, when I was seven years old. Elvis was happening, and Elvis sang “Hound Dog” to a Basset Hound on TV. And even when I was seven, I knew that was pretty fucking stupid.  I saw what they were doing. It's like, man, leave it alone. Just have the guy sing.


	So it's not so much the absurdity of rock & roll, but the absurdity of the selling of it, and people's attitudes from the inside, and the view that it's something more important than it is. I think there's probably less hubris in this film 'cause we're already a little bit defeated and ragged because we've been around so long.Did “Big Bottom” partly come from “Fat Bottomed Girls”?Absolutely, by Queen. We thought, “Yeah, it does make the rockin' world go round…” We just made it about one specific, made-up person. We really wrote that one all together. T-Rob gave us the first line, “Bigger the cushion, the sweeter the pushing,” and that's something that he heard in the streets in the Bronx. Once we got the notion that we're all playing basses and there's primarily lower-end, the song is about itself.

What's your memory of creating the Stonehenge gag?I had read that some act had wanted to do a big Stonehenge set and they built it and couldn't get it in the venue, and I thought, maybe we do this other thing, where it doesn't work for another reason. It just seemed like a funny payoff to have this little tiny thing emerge.


What does it feel like to look in the mirror when you're dressed as David St. Hubbins? It's not like this sudden jump from 1984 to now — you've been this guy many times.People mainly wanna talk to me about that. People do recognize me, but they recognize me as much for Clue. Weirdly, that was not a hit, but Clue was a big home-video thing, and people in their fifties are telling me, “That was my favorite movie when I was a kid.” But people recognize me for Tap. They wanna talk about it.


	I mostly thought about what David was going through and what he was out to get. I think we know that he's a very lonely guy We did a lot of interview stuff that's not in the film, and I just got a chance to go wide with David's last 15, 20 years. So I know stuff that you don't know. But the bottom line is that he really missed this. He missed being part of a band, and I could see how you would if you had nothing else going on.


Do you approach dramatic roles essentially the same as you do comedy?On Better Call Saul, someone else did all the writing for me. And they were really good at it. That's top-line writing right there. It's a different thing, because for one thing, I've never improvised a dramatic film. I would think that would be a little more limiting, because in the back of the brain, there's the joke gland and that can't help but be activated when you're improvising a comedy, and you're standing there with Fred Willard or Jennifer Coolidge, or these people that you know could destroy you, just because they're so funny and so remarkable. So it's just different when someone else is doing the talking for you.

	











What stands out in your memory from working with Elton John and Paul McCartney?They were two different guys, obviously, and Elton's stuff with us really revolves around the playing. He was great and very funny, and very pleasant and fun to be with. And Paul was a little bit more — the character of Paul McCartney was a little clearer.


	Paul did the sweetest thing. My God. I was doing Glengarry Glen Ross on Broadway, and he came to see the show. He comes backstage and he gives me a big hug and everything. And somebody says, “Oh, you know each other?” And he said, “Yeah, we're in a movie together.” He was just amazing. He was just great. And it was great to be at odds with him emotionally in the scene and in the repercussions of the scene. He was a hundred percent real. And he learned my dumb song that I wrote fortysomething years ago.


You guys are apparently playing one more concert. Would you be OK with that being the end of Spinal Tap?Sure. If you only halfway exist, then vanishing altogether is not a big chore. We don't wanna ride it too long. I don't think this is the right age to be if you're gonna go out on the road and do a real tour. So I'd be fine. Whatever happens, really.


Christopher Guest told me he's retired from filmmaking. Does any part of you want to nudge him to do other stuff?I wouldn't nudge Chris. He does what he wants to do. I think maybe his last experience [as the writer-director of the 2016 comedy Mascots] wasn't all positive. I don't know. We've never really discussed it, but I think he felt like it was not presented well. I think he'd reached the end of that. I always thought that he should have pulled what one of the Zucker brothers did, just go rogue and do something that's not a comedy. But you don't tell Chris what to do. He's made his own decisions and they've all worked out really well. These films are very influential in how comedy stories are told. That's what he does.


Retirement doesn't seem to be on your radar.I worked with Jerry Orbach when I did a Law & Order, and I said, “How is it possible that in the course of four years I saw you do six [Broadway] shows?” He said, “I love to work more than anything.” And I said, “So when actors talk about retiring…” he goes, “Fuck that. When I wrap my last day, just take me right to the cemetery unless there's a golf course on the way.” He had his priorities.

	Six weeks before he passed, he was still working. He's that guy, and my wife's the same way. Retire? Come on. It's silly. And I don't have something as specific as Chris has to retire from. I'm just an actor. I'm a hired gun. I've done nine Broadway shows in the past 25 years. And I love it. And I love working on film too, except you gotta get up earlier. It's just something I really love to do.

	











I have to mention your courtroom breakdown scene in Better Call Saul — it's one of the greatest acting moments of the last few years.I knew this guy, even as he was discovering that he didn't know himself as well as he thought he did. I thought that was an interesting thing to play, the self-discovery that you're still trying to keep at arm's length. Usually, keeping it simple is the right thing. But this was a very complex character, and I had to keep all those plates in the air, and it just worked out. Gordon Smith wrote the script. Of course, everybody works on those scripts — Peter [Gould] and Vince [Gilligan] and Tom [Schnauz] and all these people work on these scripts and they get them perfect. It's a really special case. Those guys really are the best.

This week in Staff Picks, Staff Writer Emma Keates checks in with Big Thief post-“interpersonal issues,” and Editor-In-Chief Danette Chavez recommends a fizzy treat of a biopic.



Big Thief could not have come up with a better name for their latest album than Double Infinity. The Brooklyn folk outfit's work has always had an innate timelessness to it, but it's never felt so expansive—nor so intimate—as it does on the new record. That feeling is partly a function of Double Infinity‘s unusual recording process. Until 2024, the band had been an almost preternaturally close quartet—so much so, that founding bassist Max Oleartchik commented that they had almost “melted into each other” in a 2019 interview with the Los Angeles Times. That was before Oleartchik parted ways with the band last year for what both parties have attributed exclusively to “interpersonal issues,” leaving vocalist-guitarist Adrianne Lenker, guitarist Buck Meek, and drummer James Krivchenia to forge ahead as a trio.

One might think that this downsizing would make the music feel smaller in turn, but Oleartchik's absence turned out to be incredibly generative for the band. Instead of merely finding a new bassist, the band invited 10 musicians, including prominent new age artist Laraaji, to riff and improvise and play (in multiple senses of the word) on some basic concepts they'd previously written over the course of three weeks' worth of recording sessions. The resulting album feels like community personified, captured on stereo. On Double Infinity, the band's previously tight instrumentations give way to a lush and, at times, almost otherworldly cacophony of sound and feeling. Despite her keen lyricism, Lenker has always used her voice as an instrument—just one piece of the larger puzzle. That practice is particularly effective here as she investigates the ways words often fail to capture the strongest of emotions. “I find you in a cafe/We proceed to only half-say,” she sings on “Words” before her voice is swallowed up by a chorus of others. She doesn't need to finish the sentence; we already know—or rather, we can feel—how it ends. The next track, “Los Angeles,” begins with warm, overlapping laughter, presumably from the artists in the studio. In that moment, it's as poignant as any lyric.

This is an album that will make you want to grab a guitar or a tambourine or even one of those little egg shakers and sing around a campfire with your closest friends. It will make you want to splash in a river or run through a field at sunset or fall in love. Even for Big Thief newbies, this is one that may stick with you for what feels longer than forever. 



My watch list of late has taken me from 19th-century Hawaii to 20th-century Italy, and from 1970s Germany to present-day South Korea. The latest stop on my international virtual tour is Halmstad, a midsize city in Sweden and the setting for a sunny biopic about the formation of one of the country's most enduring pop groups. Directed by Per Simonsson, Sounds Of Summer tells the first chapter in the story of Gyllende Tider, the winsome Swedish band founded by Per Gessle (later of Roxette, and, at least once a decade since their split in the 1980s, Gyllende Tider). The film, which will be available on Viaplay beginning September 18, is fairly conventional but, like any good pop tune, is nonetheless catchy. Per (Valdemar Wahlbeck) is introduced as an introspective music nerd who breaks out of his shell after watching a single live-music performance. The music and lyrics flow quickly from there, and Per builds his band—Mats “MP” Persson (Ville Lövgren), Micke Syd Andersson (Phoenix Parnevik), Anders Herrlin (Lancelot Hedman Graaf), Göran Fritzon (Xawier Kulas)—with not much more difficulty. 

Unlike a lot of musician biopics, Sounds Of Summer mostly avoids heaviness, preferring to keep things as light as the songs performed by the band at its core. The Per Gessle of this film isn't so much a tortured genius as he is a somewhat lonely guy who understands better than most how music connects us. He forms a band to get the songs out of his head and into the world, and ends up making his first real friends. Gyllende Tider's success is never really in doubt, not even during a disappointing trip to Stockholm. But that just leaves more time to listen to flirty, now-classic tracks like “Flickorna på TV2” (“The Girls On TV2”) and the perennial hit “Sommartider.” “This song will haunt us every summer for decades,” muses a music executive at EMI about the latter song, and, apocryphal or not, the observation wasn't wrong; “Sommartider” charted in Sweden multiple times throughout the '80s. Even now, it pops back up cyclically, like visitors returning to their favorite beach town. And Gyllende Tider reunites with similar regularity, still playing to huge crowds. Sounds Of Summer goes down like a lemonade that's on the sweeter side, but after all, it is still summer for another nine days.

Jon Cryer had an extensive career before starring in CBS sitcom hit Two And A Half Men with Charlie Sheen, and he's had a pretty good career since then. (Notably having a lot of hammy fun as the Lex Luthor of the now-defunct Arrowverse.) But he's now once again picking up attention, not for his own life, but for the ways it's been pulled into Sheen's undeniable orbit over the years. That's courtesy of a new Netflix documentary about his old co-star, aka Charlie Sheen, which Cryer ended up sitting down for an interview for (after a number of stated reservations), and which saw him compare his old colleague to no less weird a figure than former North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il.

Cryer specifically deployed this geopolitical nightmare metaphor while talking about Sheen's contract negotiations as Two And A Half Men (and his various crises) went on, which ultimately saw Sheen take home roughly three times what Cryer was making on the series. “The dictator of North Korea was a guy named Kim Jong-Il,” Cryer notes in the doc (per Variety). “He acted crazy all the time and thus got enormous amounts of aid from countries who were so scared of him that they would shovel money at him. Well, that's what happened here. [Sheen's] negotiations went off the charts because his life was falling apart. Me, whose life was pretty good at that time, I got a third of that.” (For what it's worth, this is not the first time Cryer has compared Sheen's tactics to North Korean appeasement strategy; in an interview with us last year, he compared Sheen to Kim Jong-un, instead.)

Cryer points out that Sheen (who was “in the midst of falling apart in every way that I can imagine”) had CBS at least partially over a barrel because the show had been pre-renewed for multiple seasons before Sheen's struggles with addiction kicked back up. (Sheen ultimately left the series before a final season, which brought in Ashton Kutcher to replace him; the show's final episode remains a weird meta commentary on the whole situation, with the characters worried “Charlie” is coming back to kill them, and creator Chuck Lorre dropping a piano on a Sheen stand-in to end the show as a whole.)

Cryer—who also wrote a lot about Sheen in his 2015 memoir—is apparently gun-shy enough about the whole thing these days that he really debated even sitting down for the aka Charlie Sheen interview. “If you wonder what it's like to work with Charlie Sheen for eight years,” he jokes in the just-released doc, “When I started, I had hair. I had some trepidation about participating in this, partially because part of the cycle of Charlie Sheen's life has been that he messes up terribly, he hits rock bottom, and then he gets things going again. And he brings a lot of positivity in his life, and that's when he burns himself out again. He just can't help but set that house on fire, and I didn't want to be a part of that cycle. I'm not here to build him up and I'm not here to tear him down. But I sure hope this doesn't go bad.”

	As Prime Video heads south of the border with the next The Boys offshoot, franchise boss Eric Kripke has an update for fans.


	The 2x Emmy nominee recently revealed that The Boys: Mexico, which hails from executive producers Diego Luna and Gael García Bernal, is “super fun” and “a totally different tone” from its parent series.


	“The pilot of [The] Boys: Mexico is being developed right now,” Kripke told Collider. “It's very cool. I mean, who knows — obviously you never know, but I can say that the world itself meets the standard of all of our spin-offs. It's our world but a totally different tone, and it's super fun. Gael and Diego are executive producers, which is amazing and [they] really engaged with it, so — short answer is we'll see, but I think the script is good.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Back in 2023, Deadline reported that The Boys franchise was expanding with the Mexico iteration, which will be penned by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer (Blue Beetle). With the series expected to film in Mexico, no plot details have yet been revealed.


	Luna and Bernal, longtime friends who previously starred together in Alfonso Cuarón's Y Tu Mamá También (2001) will potentially star in the spin-off as well, although not in major roles.


	In July, Kripke wrapped the fifth and final season of The Boys, which premieres in 2026. Meanwhile, Season 2 of Gen V debuts Sept. 17, and the prequel series Vought Rising is currently in the works. Prime also has the animated spin-off The Boys Presents: Diabolical.

In the new comedy “Driver's Ed,” Sam Nivola (of “White Lotus” incest fame) plays a lovesick high school senior, Jeremy, who has a passion for movies. He made a short film that won some kind of prize, and he frequently pulls out a little video camera to capture a moment that strikes him as cinematic. 

If you told me that “Driver's Ed” was itself made by Jeremy, I'd believe you; it has all the distracted, hurried texture of typical teenage creative output, batting at big emotions it doesn't quite understand and zigging haphazardly in various directions as it makes its way to the most obvious of conclusions. Were I his film teacher, I'd give Jeremy a solid B on the assignment but suggest maybe he consider majoring in accounting.

Jeremy didn't make the film, though. Bobby Farrelly did, he of “Dumb and Dumber” and “There's Something About Mary” fame. Farrelly is 67, and Thomas Moffett, who wrote the film, is 47. So I'm not sure what their excuse is. “Driver's Ed” is almost shockingly generic, a boilerplate teen road-trip movie whose only distinct personality trait is having no personality at all. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Were it not for the iPhones and a “lit” here and a “no cap” there, “Driver's Ed” could have been made in the early 2000s, those waning days of the last great teen cinema epoch. It has all the requisite components: a nerdy-cute boy protagonist, a wise-beyond-her-years dream girl, a funny stoner friend. Its sensitivities are more evolved than those of, say, “American Pie,” but “Driver's Ed” would otherwise fit cozily alongside any of the movies that “American Pie” inspired. 

There are glimmers of originality in Moffett's script, flashes of idiosyncratic detail that suggest something richer, more personal that could have been had Farrelly not sanded down every edge he could. Farrelly takes broad swings at comedy, but few of his jokes land. Whatever magic he used to have has gone; his instincts have faded, his timing is off. 

The film concerns Jeremy's madcap adventure to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where his bitterly missed girlfriend, Samantha (Lilah Pate), is a freshman at UNC. Jeremy is pretty sure he's going to lose Samantha to the temptations of college life if he doesn't do something big. So he steals a driving instruction car and steals off into the Carolina backcountry, with three mismatched fellow students in tow. What ensues is meant to be a comically odyssean journey in pursuit of blind passion. In reality, a few minor things happen and then the movie ends exactly as we expect it to. 

 










At least the company is welcome. Nivola is a charming, natural actor. He breathes something like real life into Moffett's bland characterization. He has able support from Aidan Laprete as an affable slacker, Mohana Krishnan as a Type A overachiever, and TikTok star Sophie Telegadis, doing very convincing Samaire Armstrong-on-“The O.C.” drag. The kids have a lively, winsome rapport and manage to register some specificity in the face of Farrelly and Moffett's myriad tired clichés. 

The adults don't fare quite so well. Molly Shannon does her noble best with a Bad Principal role, while Kumail Nanjiani strains for anything resembling humor as a loser substitute teacher. I'm sure both saw some value in working for one of the Farrelly brothers, even in 2025, but they maybe should have held out for something better.

“Driver's Ed” is kindhearted and well-intentioned enough that one can't outright hate it. But Farrelly seriously tries that good will as the movie lurches along. Its 98 minutes feel like twice that. The expected tangents and vignettes of a road movie—in this case a meet-cute with a dog owner, a run in with a petty thief who has the whitest veneers I've ever seen, a quick trip in the back of a refrigerated truck full of fur coats (yeah I don't get it either)—are to a one fatally dull and wholly unnecessary. “Driver's Ed” has all the arbitrary comedy of a bad improv set, seeming to figure that randomness itself is funny. There are a few laughs to be found in the film, little moments of wit or weirdness, but the film is otherwise a mirthless drag rescued only by its bright leads. Maybe let them make the movie next time.

 










“Driver's Ed” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Duki's meteoric rise in Argentina's trap scene will be the focus of a new Netflix documentary. On Friday, the streaming service released the first trailer for Rockstar: Duki Desde el Fin Del Mundo, premiering Oct. 2.


	Directed by Alejandro Hartmann, the film traces Duki's evolution from freestyler to cultural phenomenon in South America and Spain. “People saw with their own eyes that I was a little kid like any other,” a young Duki says in the clip, speaking of his rise doing freestyles for El Quinto Escalón. “Before freestyling, I wanted to make music.”


	The trailer weaves together moments of acclaim and criticism, along with emotional family memories, including an interview with his mother in tears, recalling, “I couldn't believe what I was looking at!” as home videos of him as a baby play.


	“At a turning point in his career and artistic identity, Mauro finds himself shedding his skin and confronting his inner demons to carry forward the story of Duki and the movement he represents,” reads the synopsis. “Who is Mauro, and who is Duki in the end?”

	











	The teaser also features appearances by Bizarrap and Young Miko. “Duko is like putting on the superhero suit,” says Duki at the end of the video.

Rockstar: Duki Desde el Fin Del Mundo comes several months after he released his album 5202 in July, featuring “Golfista,” “5202 Type Beat,” and “Agarro La Plata.” And in 2024, Duki welcomed Myke Towers, Eladio Carrion, YG, and Lil Wayne on Ameri.

	











	“For this one, we gave ourselves a lot of time,” he told Rolling Stone when discussing the record back in December. “I'm very in the moment, so it's hard for me to make an album and hold it for a while, and then go back into the studio to re-record things, but I felt like it was worth it for this.”

Hey, quick question: What's up with all the golf comedies right now? Apple TV+ has Owen Wilson's Stick, while Netflix just mined a bunch of views out of dusting off Happy Gilmore and parading what's left of him out and around the golf course. Now, we've got new casting info on Will Ferrell's upcoming golf TV comedy for Netflix—referred to, at least initially, as just Golf—so clearly, some folks in Hollywood are obsessed with milking laughs out of the ol' good walk spoiled. (Is it just a Ted Lasso thing, but without the hassle of getting a whole soccer team assembled? Or just an acknowledgement of aging comedy demographics?)

Anyway: For the casting info itself, per Variety, the series will now become even more of a 1990s Saturday Night Live reunion than previously reported. Created by Ferrell, the series was already set to invoke some of that old Superstar energy by pairing him up with his old pal Molly Shannon, and now fellow SNL mainstay Chris Parnell has been added to the mix. The Rick And Morty and Archer voice actor (who will always be Dr. Spaceman in our hearts) joined Saturday Night Live in 1998, where he had several years of overlap with both Shannon and Ferrell. (In fact, Parnell recounted in recent years that, when he was fired from the series in 2001, Ferrell was one of a couple of co-stars who personally petitioned Lorne Michaels, ultimately successfully, to bring him back.) Now he'll co-star in the new series as Anton, “a PGA Tour board member and all around jerk.”

In addition to Parnell, the new series has also added two other performers to its roster. Katelyn Tarver (and yes, before you ask, she's Drew Tarver's sister) will join the series as a social media influencer engaged to Jimmy Tatro's character, the son of Ferrell's “legendary golfer” main character. Also a musician, Tarver came up in the kid TV mines, with starring roles on programs like Big Time Rush. (She more recently had a regular appearance on the fourth season of HBO's Ballers.) Meanwhile, the series has also cast It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia and Mythic Quest regular David Hornsby, taking a break from his usual writing and producing duties to focus on acting, in this case as “a rich southern man who is dating” Shannon's character. We'll take it.

The Golf show had a slightly messy trip to production: It was originally co-developed by Ferrell and Ramy Youssef; the younger comic actor departed the series over creative differences last month, at the same time Shannon was coming aboard. The series also stars Fortune Feimster; no word yet on when it'll air its 10-episode first season on Netflix.

	A federal judge has denied Justin Baldoni's last-minute bid to depose Taylor Swift as he prepares for an upcoming trial over Blake Lively's claims she was sexually harassed and retaliated against during the filming of It Ends With Us.


	In an order handed down Friday, U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman ruled that Baldoni and his co-defendants at Wayfarer Studios simply waited too long to seek the sit-down and missed their chance. The judge did, however, grant a 10-day extension for Lively to take the depositions of Baldoni and two others. He said the defendants dragged their feet in producing the requested documents, so Lively and her lawyers deserved the extra time to prepare. In the case of Swift, the judge said Baldoni and Wayfarer failed to show “good cause” to justify a similar reprieve.


	“The only justification [Baldoni and the Wayfarer parties] have provided for the extension is their assertion that Swift's preexisting professional obligations now prevent her from appearing for a deposition prior to October 20, 2025,” Judge Liman wrote. “Importantly, however, the Wayfarer parties have provided no discussion of when they began attempting to schedule the deposition. Discovery has been ongoing in this case for approximately six months.”

	











	The judge noted that Baldoni previously requested Swift's deposition in May 2025 before ultimately withdrawing that subpoena. “They have offered no evidence that they have served a renewed subpoena on Swift. Thus, at most, the Wayfarer parties have demonstrated that scheduling the deposition now presents logistical difficulties; that does not answer the question of why the deposition could not have been conducted earlier,” he wrote. “Having failed to demonstrate appropriate diligence, the requested extension is denied.”

	











	The judge's order followed after Baldoni's lawyer, Ellyn S. Garofalo, claimed in a letter to the court filed Thursday that Swift had “agreed” to appear for deposition but was unable to do so before Oct. 20. The letter requested an extension of the Sept. 30 discovery deadline to accommodate Swift's schedule.

	On Friday, Swift's lawyer stepped into the fray to set the record straight, refuting the claim that his client had agreed to answer questions under oath.


	“As counsel for the parties know, since the inception of this matter, we have consistently maintained that my client has no material role in this action,” Swift's lawyer J. Douglas Baldridge wrote in a letter to the judge filed in Manhattan federal court. He was clear that Swift “did not agree to a deposition,” but if she was “forced,” she had informed Baldoni's camp that her schedule was too busy to accommodate it before October 20. Baldridge didn't explain what the conflict was, but Swift has been a little busy lately, getting engaged to Travis Kelce and preparing for the release of her new album, The Life of a Showgirl, set to debut Oct. 3.


	Lively, 38, is suing Baldoni, 41, and Wayfarer Studios with claims Baldoni subjected her to “disturbing” sexual harassment during production of It Ends With Us and then engaged in a retaliatory campaign to “eviscerate” her credibility. Lively alleges the harassment included an incident during the filming of a slow dance where no sound was recorded. She says Baldoni improvised a scene where he “leaned forward and slowly dragged his lips from her ear and down her neck as he said, ‘It smells so good.'” Lively alleges Baldoni also tried to add a graphic sex scene where their characters would climax together on their wedding night. She says Baldoni then “intrusively” asked her if she and her husband, the actor Ryan Reynolds, climaxed simultaneously during intercourse.


	Swift was initially ensnared in the fight when Baldoni filed a dueling defamation lawsuit against Lively that included claims Swift was present during a pivotal meeting at Lively's Tribeca penthouse that involved Lively's efforts to make changes to the movie script.

	In a separate response letter filed Friday, before the judge's ruling, one of Lively's lawyers blasted Baldoni's camp for an “astounding” lack of respect for “Swift's privacy and schedule.” The lawyer urged the court to deny Baldoni's request for the late deposition.

	











	“The Wayfarer defendants have repeatedly sought to bring Ms. Swift into this litigation to fuel their relentless media strategy. In this latest effort, the Wayfarer defendants assert – though, notably, without evidence – that Ms. Swift has supposedly ‘agreed' to sit for a deposition sometime between October 20-25, some three weeks after the close of fact discovery in this matter,” Lively's lawyer Michael J. Gottlieb wrote in his opposition.


	“Ms. Swift is someone whose calendar should be presumed to be packed with professional obligations for months in advance,” he continued. “At any point over the past six months, the Wayfarer defendants could have noticed a deposition, served a subpoena, and negotiated an agreeable time and place for this deposition. But they did not. Instead, the Wayfarer Defendants previously noticed Ms. Swift's deposition in May 2025, accompanied by a barrage of press stories covering the same, only to withdraw that subpoena to much fanfare.”


	Gottlieb claimed Baldoni and Wayfarer did “not even attempt to explain their need for [Swift's] deposition.” He further accused them of trying “to generate a media spectacle in this matter.”


	Swift had a very public friendship with Lively prior to the legal war, but they have not been seen together in months. In his court filings, Baldoni claimed that Swift — originally identified only as “megacelebrity” — supported Lively's edits to the movie script, as did Reynolds. Baldoni said after the penthouse meeting, Lively sent him a text message referring to Swift and Reynolds as her “dragons.” Baldoni said he interpreted the message as a suggestion Lively could tap Swift to “make things very difficult for him.”


	“If you ever get around to watching Game of Thrones, you'll appreciate that I'm Khaleesi, and like her, I happen to have a few dragons,” the purported text from Lively read. “For better or worse, but usually better. Because my dragons also protect those I fight for. So really we all benefit from those gorgeous monsters of mine. You will too, I can promise you.”

	Back in May, a rep for Swift slammed Baldoni's initial attempts to subpoena the singer. “Taylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film,” the rep previously told Rolling Stone. The rep said the subpoena was “designed to use Taylor Swift's name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case.”

	











	Lively's battle with Baldoni first made headlines last year when The New York Times published a Dec. 21 story titled “‘We Can Bury Anyone': Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine.” The story revealed Lively had filed a precursor complaint against Baldoni with the California Civil Rights Department.

Sharon Osbourne posted a heartfelt message to fans on Friday, thanking them for their support following the death of her husband and metal legend Ozzy Osbourne, who died on July 22.


	“I'm still having trouble finding the words to express how grateful I am for the overwhelming love and support you've shown on social media,” she wrote in an Instagram post. “Your comments, posts, and tributes have brought me more comfort than you know. None of it has gone unnoticed, in fact, it's carried me through many nights.”


	Sharon also revealed that she has formed a newfound connection with falconry, which her daughter Kelly Osbourne had introduced her to the day before. Alongside the post, Sharon shared a video of her and Kelly with the trained birds of prey. In one clip, an owl glides toward Sharon's extended arm before gracefully perching on it.


	“Though I'm still finding my footing, I wanted to share some glorious creatures I had the chance to spend an afternoon with. The connection you make with these powerful birds is built entirely on trust and confidence,” continued Sharon. “They'll choose to perch on you only if they sense you are safe and unafraid of them. It's a bond I know all too well, and the experience was nothing short of magical.”

	She ended her note by writing, “I love you all, and I thank you deeply for the otherworldly amount of love you continue to send my way.”

A post shared by Sharon Osbourne (@sharonosbourne)


	Earlier this month, Sharon and Ozzy's son Jack Osbourne recounted his final week with his father in the first episode of his podcast since his passing. “After my dad's show in Birmingham, I stuck around, hung out for a week with the family at the house with my kids, it was a really amazing week,” Jack said. “My dad was in an amazing mood. Every day, he was opening up the newspaper and seeing different reviews and different stories from the Back to the Beginning show, and it was great.”

	











	Although Jack said his immediate reaction was a surge of “sadness and pain… so many thoughts,” he later said he was grateful for the timing of Ozzy's death so soon after Black Sabbath‘s Back to the Beginning concert: “There is almost a perfection to it. He got to say goodbye in such a profound way.”

	More than 20 years later, Marlon Wayans is ready to get back to the Shorty within as he prepares to film Scary Movie 6.


	The actor, who co-wrote and starred in the first two films of the horror parody franchise, teased a “no holds barred” installment full of “equal opportunity offenders” after the last sequel premiered in 2013.


	“It's how we always do it,” he told Entertainment Weekly. “We just want to make everybody laugh, and we don't care if you're sensitive. Even sensitive people need to laugh at themselves.”


	Wayans continued, “Just know that we're not just laughing at you, you get the chance to laugh at others. When we did White Chicks, we made fun of everybody. We made fun of Black people, we made fun of white people, we made fun of Hispanic people. That's just what we do. We make fun of the world, make light of the world. It's not to harm, it's to bring humor. You may offend people here and there, but, hey, not every joke's gonna land 100 percent, but if you tell a joke and 100 people laugh and one person walks out, that's still a good joke.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The Wayans Bros. alum says the upcoming sequel will be “a great conversation piece, that we can all sit down and laugh together, over three generations of people who haven't had great comedy in a long time.”


	“I think you have to acknowledge how comedy has changed,” explained Wayans. “Not just horror has changed, but films have changed, the audience has changed, the world has shifted. I think the way to do that is to make the generational gap part of the conversation. That's how we constructed the movie so we could talk about it all. It's a conversation with these funny characters, and they just so happen to be going through this. The more pressure you put on characters and the more horrific the situations, that's when you really get to know the characters.”

	











	Last month, Deadline exclusively reported that Anna Faris and Regina Hall are back for Scary Movie 6, with Marlon penning the script alongside brothers Shawn Wayans and Keenen Ivory Wayans. Although the brothers developed the franchise together, they were absent from the last three installments.


	“We have plans to bring a few more back,” said Wayans, noting that “no deal's been done.”

“This kind of content scars you for life.” As shock images of Charlie Kirk and Iryna Zarutska's deaths spread on social media, experts reveal how the long-term impact of such videos is more harmful than you think.


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	In the 1999 thriller 8mm, Nicolas Cage plays a private detective who watches a graphic film of a girl's murder. His character becomes obsessed with solving the crime. He watches the footage repeatedly, leaving him psychologically wrecked and prone to violence himself. As one character puts it: “There are some things you can't unsee … the devil don't change, the devil changes you.”


	This week, millions of people — many unwittingly — saw the devil: a horrific video of 31-year-old conservative activist Charlie Kirk getting shot by an assassin's bullet, his neck gushing with blood, while hosting a student event at Utah Valley University. The video instantly went viral across social media platforms, autoplaying for hours on X, in particular, to countless users casually scrolling their feeds until moderators eventually clamped down on its spread.

	The footage came on the heels of another gruesome viral moment: The death of 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska, who was stabbed on a Charlotte light rail in a random attack straight out of a horror movie. While the stabbing itself was not widely seen, the moments just before and after her murder were difficult to avoid, including shots of Zarutska's haunting, terror-filled reaction to her killer.


	The widespread and quasi-nonconsensual viewing of such content is something that's relatively new.


	The Zapruder film documenting John F. Kennedy's assassination was arguably the most famous video of a real-life event of all time. Yet for decades the footage was largely unavailable outside of the occasional TV news special. Oliver Stone's 1991 film JFK — released nearly three decades after the assassination— marked the first time many Americans watched the unedited recording of that day. 

	











	In the 1980s and ‘90s, the notorious straight-to-video film series Faces of Death featured scenes of real-life fatal calamities (along with some faked stunts). The film was an underground sensation, an endurance test for morbidly curious teens.


	Then came the World Trade Center attacks on 9/11. Journalist Daniel Pearl getting beheaded in 2002. The Boston Marathon bombings in 2013. The live-streamed Christchurch mosque shooting in 2019. George Floyd's murder in 2020. Each produced a widely seen shock horror video.


	This is doing something bad to us.


	News editors have long exercised editorial discretion over content deemed unnecessarily disturbing — not printing, for instance, paparazzi photos of Princess Diana dead inside her car crash, or not airing recordings of people leaping from the Twin Towers on 9/11. Even last week, major news outlets avoided posting the clip of Kirk getting shot. On social media, however, the guardrails are practically nonexistent. 


	Utah Governor Spencer Cox has it exactly right when he declared that the spread of the Kirk video “is not good to consume … social media is a cancer on our society.” And while details about Kirk's assassin are currently scarce, you can make one safe bet about him; a link shared by most modern-day ideologically driven killers: They tend to be chronically — if not outright radicalized — online.


	Professor Roxane Cohen Silver has authored several studies on the effects of watching real-life violence. Silver has found that while the impact of viewing a single graphic video is small, it can measurably have a negative effect on mental health for literally years. Such images get permanently stored in your long-term memory and are linked to being more fearful and anxious (if you've seen JFK, you've likely never been able to forget the president's head exploding to Kevin Costner intoning “back, and to the left…”).

	











	This effect multiplies with additional viewing of similar content, which people tend to paradoxically seek out after their initial exposure — not despite finding the tape upsetting but because they found it upsetting (it's like how if you're afraid of spiders, you tend to look for spiders, Silver notes).


	“Years ago, we thought people would habituate to violent exposure,” Silver says. “Instead, any exposure is linked to being more sensitive and seeking out the next set of graphic images. It's a very cyclical process. We see increased distress and anxiety over time, hyper-vigilance over time and actually found cardiovascular problems.” This effect is also different than watching violent movies, TV shows or video games — humans don't have the same trauma response when they know footage isn't real.


	There is a counter argument to this: That images of monstrous acts need to be seen for society to have the appropriate response. World War II concentration camp footage, for instance, has been instrumental in fighting Holocaust denialism. One might also point to Floyd's death video, which spawned a movement for racial justice and a push towards more policing oversight. Outrage over the video, however, also was blamed for riots and the Defund the Police movement, which many now consider a mistake that might have precipitated a rise in violent crime in some cities (the statistics are often debated). Similarly, the traumatic footage of 3,000 deaths on 9/11 spurred the United States to rally the world against organized terror groups yet was also used to justify the Iraq War, which resulted in an estimated 200,000 civilian deaths.

	











	And so: Watching graphic tragedies successful provokes human empathy and outrage, but our subsequent decisions — often made from anger and fear — can result in even deadlier deadly outcomes.  


	“This is an extraordinarily important point,” Silver says. “There can be both a positive for society and negative for the individual. For the individual, we have found there is no psychological benefit to exposure to graphic or gruesome images.”


	Which brings us back to Kirk's death. Dr. Sarah M. Coyne, a professor and media researcher, says throwing politics into any of these videos runs the risk of public response to traumatic footage spinning into dangerous directions. “It's horrific and I worry that it will just begat more violence,” Coyne says. “I hope the people who saw that have empathy for the individual and for his family and have the message that violence is not okay.”


	Political leaders might consider pushing social media companies to increase content moderation — a practice which declined in the wake of backlash over platforms censoring conservative stories and views during the pandemic and 2020 election. Targeting graphic imagery rather than political text could be a start but even this idea comes with a cost. Several stories have documented how moderators of violent content also become traumatized, with one former Meta staffer telling Euronews, “This kind of content scars you for life.”


	Using AI to aid moderation might be another solution. But the easiest and most practical idea might be to finally embrace and evangelize the irritating and unwelcome advice you've increasingly heard over the last decade: Quit social media and get off your damn phone.

An attorney for the pop superstar refutes Baldoni's claim that she consented to questioning in the It Ends With Us legal battle.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



UPDATE (Sept. 12): In an order Friday evening, Judge Lewis J. Liman denied Justin Baldoni's request to depose Taylor Swift after the current discovery deadline, stating that Baldoni's team “failed to demonstrate appropriate diligence” after only recently reaching out to Swift's camp about scheduling the deposition. This means Baldoni has lost his shot at deposing Swift, foreclosing what could have been an intense court battle over whether the pop star would be forced to sit for questioning.


PREVIOUSLY: Taylor Swift‘s lawyers say the pop superstar has not agreed to sit for a deposition in Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's bitter legal feud over the movie It Ends With Us, refuting claims from Baldoni's camp that the star had consented to the sit-down.


	Baldoni's attorneys wrote in a request for a discovery schedule extension on Thursday (Sept. 11) that Swift “has agreed to appear for deposition” but cannot do so earlier than Oct. 20 because of “preexisting professional obligations” — presumably referring to the rollout of her highly anticipated twelfth album, The Life of a Showgirl, which arrives on Oct. 3.




			Trending on Billboard		







	But Swift's longtime attorney Douglas Baldridge says in a Friday (Sept. 12) court filing that this is false.


	“My client did not agree to a deposition, but if she is forced into a deposition, we advised (after first hearing about the deposition just three days ago) that her schedule would accommodate the time required during the week of October 20 if the parties were able to work out their disputes,” wrote Baldridge.


	Baldoni has been saying for months that Swift's friendship with Lively makes her a key witness in the lawsuit, in which Lively alleges Baldoni sexually harassed her on the set of It Ends With Us and then orchestrated a retaliatory smear campaign after she complained.


	In June, the federal judge overseeing the legal battle granted Baldoni's request to access Swift and Lively's text messages as part of the document discovery process. Now, Baldoni wants to depose Swift.


	The current discovery schedule has all depositions concluding by the end of September, in anticipation of a March 2026 trial date. But lawyers for Baldoni and his production company, Wayfarer Studios, asked for an extension on Thursday for the Swift deposition.


	Swift's reps have previously slammed Baldoni for “creating tabloid clickbait” by dragging the star into the case despite her minimal involvement in It Ends With Us. Baldridge reiterated this position in his letter to the court on Friday, writing, “Since the inception of this matter we have consistently maintained that my client has no material role in this action.”


	Lively's lawyers have similarly lambasted Baldoni for involving Swift in the litigation, writing in their own Friday court response that the strategy is designed “to generate a media spectacle.”


	The Lively team is against extending the discovery cutoff to question Swift, saying it's Baldoni's own fault for waiting until this week to contact the singer's counsel about scheduling her deposition.


	“The Wayfarer defendants' lack of diligence, and disrespect for Ms. Swift's privacy and schedule, is astounding,” wrote Lively's lawyer Michael Gottlieb. “Ms. Swift is someone whose calendar should be presumed to be packed with professional obligations for months in advance. At any point over the past six months, the Wayfarer defendants could have noticed a deposition, served a subpoena and negotiated an agreeable time and place for this deposition. But they did not.”


	Judge Lewis J. Liman has not yet ruled on Baldoni's discovery extension request.


	The fiery legal battle between Lively and Baldoni has been in full force since last December, when the actress brought sexual harassment and retaliation claims against her It Ends With Us co-star and director.


	Baldoni vehemently denied the allegations and countersued Lively and her inner circle for defamation, though Judge Liman later dismissed Baldoni's counterclaims as legally invalid. Now, only Lively's original allegations are headed toward trial this coming spring.


	The Baldoni team has sought to involve Swift since the early days of the case, writing in court filings that Lively weaponized the “influential and wealthy celebrities” in her orbit to gain leverage over him while making It Ends With Us.


This story was updated on Sept. 12 at 2:27 p.m. ET to reflect that Swift has not agreed to a deposition.

Someone has leaked a video of an unidentified anomalous phenomenon (UAP) — the military's preferred term for unidentified flying objects, better known as UFOs — to Congress.

As USA Today reports, this never-before-seen video was provided anonymously to Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican and member of the House of Representative's UAP Caucus, and shows a bizarre encounter that occurred last October off the coast of Yemen.

In the video, an Air Force MQ-9 "Reaper" drone tracks the object that Burlison referred to as an "orb" over the water until a second Reaper fires a precision Hellfire missile at the UAP. Although it's unclear what mission was occurring during the footage, it did occur the same time that the US and its allies were conducting strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Below is the video I revealed in our @GOPoversight UAP hearing today, made available to the public for the first time.

The strange object took the hit and was momentarily pushed off its trajectory by the missile, which also appeared to cause some debris to eject from it, before correcting course. It's unclear from the video, which zoomed out just after the strike, where the debris went.

Hellfire missiles pack a punch. As Military.com details, these missiles can be launched both air-to-air or air-to-ground, and are "capable of defeating any known tank in the world today." Whatever that orb was, in other words, its ability to bounce back from a Hellfire strike would suggest it was tougher than a tank.

During the hearing, as USA Today notes, witnesses to the event — including three military veterans — said there is no known human technology that could survive a Hellfire hit.

Discussing the video, neither Burlison nor UAP journalist George Knapp chose to hypothesize on what the video showed — but still remarked at how strangely the objected acted after the missile strike.

"That's the Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and just (bouncing) right off," Knapp said, per ABC News' write-up of the hearing. "And it kept going."

 "Yeah," the reporter responded. "What the hell is that?"

In response to ABC's requests for comment, a Department of Defense spokesperson demurred.

"I have nothing for you," they said.

Knapp, meanwhile, was glad that the video had been released, even if outside official channels.

"The public should be seeing this stuff," the UAP journalist said during the hearing, and "why you're not allowed to, I don't know."

Bizarre flying objects are usually considered a stateside phenomena.

But a remarkable shot shows one brazenly flying though the hills in the north of England – and experts are baffled. 

The mysterious aerial entity was snapped outside of Shipton in Yorkshire by photographer and local man John Tunnah.

Eerily, the Yorkshire resident took about 10 or 12 photographs from his vantage point but the object only appeared in one of them. 

Mr Tunnah said they were the 'first photos on an unfamiliar camera' that he had only just purchased. 

He described the phenomenon as a probable 'UFO' – an unidentified flying object. 

And it's remarkably similar to the classic UFO saucer shape depicted in popular culture, with a distinctive round and elongated shape. 

'Why it was manoeuvring at low level over West Yorkshire was a mystery,' Mr Tunnah told the Daily Mail. 

The bizarre saucer-shaped object was snapped with a Pentax Optio SVi camera by Yorkshire photographer John Tunnah

The photo, shared exclusively with the Daily Mail, was taken with a Pentax Optio SVi camera one Saturday morning, according to Mr Tunnah. 

'I was travelling home with it when I noticed, behind the hills beyond Silsden, a perfectly formed arch of cloud – like a cloudy rainbow,' he said. 

'I pulled in, intending to take photos. By the time I'd sorted the camera out the arch had broken up as per the photo, but I took a few shots anyway.

'That evening, I was playing with the camera and deleting shots I'd taken when I came across this one showing something on the far left.

'It didn't appear on any of the other photos I'd taken at the time.

'I'm not a "flying-saucer", or "alien visitation" freak, but whatever it was deserves the term UFO.' 

Mr Tunnah, originally from Scotland, then showed the perplexing snap to some of his friends 'just out of interest'. 

'They all tended to agree that it was "real", "solid" and appeared to be travelling at speed from the dissipating "arch" on the horizon,' he said. 

The Yorkshireman's attention was drawn by a perfectly formed arch of cloud over the trees (centre) - and only later did he notice the saucer-shaped object on the left

The object is remarkably similar to the classic UFO saucer shape depicted in popular culture, with a distinctive round and elongated shape.

John Tunnah, who took the picture, speculated that it could be a Skunk Works-type aircraft close to the horizon. 

Alternatively, it could be a fast-moving animal nearer the camera lens. 

'Various theories were put forward – such as "flying saucer" and very short lived cloud.' 

The resident speculated that it could also be be a 'Skunk Works-type aircraft of previously unknown design'. 

Skunk Works is the official pseudonym for Lockheed Martin's Advanced Development Programs (ADP), responsible for developing highly classified experimental aircraft.

Nick Pope, a UFO expert formerly with the UK's Ministry of Defence, offered a number of explanations for Mr Tunnah's photo. 

'When photos show an anomaly that wasn't seen at the time, I suspect either a glitch with the camera, or a fast-moving object like a bird or an insect, close to the lens,' he told the Daily Mail. 

But the US Department of Defense – otherwise known as the Pentagon – declined to comment on the image. 

UFO stands for 'unidentified flying object' and so the term doesn't necessarily describe an object with an extraterrestrial origin. 

But some of its characteristics adhere to common descriptions of what UFOs look like. 

Most UFOs have been described as ‘orb', ‘round' or ‘sphere', but other reported shapes include polygon, triangle and 'Tic Tac', says the Pentagon 

A Pentagon document published in 2023 revealed that the typical UFO has a round shape, usually spherical or an orb, with a white or silver colour.

Based on what it knows from reported sightings between 1996 and 2023, other UFO shapes include rectangle, oval, triangle, disk, cylinder, square and even polygon. 

Meanwhile, 16 per cent have been described as having lights, although in many cases this may have been due to their reflective qualities. 

The Pentagon also released a hotspot map that reveals the location of reported UFO sightings, including Japan and the Middle East.  

An invasion of small metallic orbs has been spotted hovering over the US in recent years, leaving the Pentagon scrambling to identify these mysterious UFOs.

A new report from the crowdsourced platform Enigma, which allows people to report sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs), reveals more than 8,000 sightings across the US between December 2022 and June 2025. 

Among these, 422 reports specifically describe metallic orbs, with the majority observed between 1am and 4am near military installations in New York, California, and Arizona. 

Eyewitnesses, including civilians, pilots, and military personnel, reported seeing the spheres hover silently before moving at extreme speeds, leaving no trace of their departure. 

Some of the sightings have been captured on video or radar, though many remain unexplained.

Donald Trump's rumoured health issues have caught people's attention yet again after his face appeared to "droop" at the 9/11 memorial. The US President, accompanied by his wife Melania Trump, was seen marking the 24th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attack earlier this week

But eagle-eyed observers were quick to suggest he may have had a stroke. Just last week, he was accused of badly trying cover his bruised hands when he appeared at the US Open — by using makeup that did not match his skin tone.

Trump's hand has led to months of speculations about his health, but White House spin doctors have repeatedly insisted it is not a cause for concern. It has led to rumours he may need IV drips.

One X, formerly Twitter, user wrote: "Trump at the 9/11 Pentagon memorial ceremony. What is wrong with his face?

"Definitely has pronounced drooping on the right side of face and mouth, typical of medical condition. Fox News blurred out the back of his right hand which is covered in makeup."

Another said: "Just watching Trump at the Pentagon. His mouth is slanted looks very like he had a stroke."

A third said: "Watching 911 memorial and seeing Trump. Why is the right side of his mouth so droopy."

An fourth X-user, tweeting from an account with the name Adam Cochran, commented: "I believe there is growing evidence that the White House is covering up the fact that Donald Trump has been dealing with TIA strokes.

"AND that he likely had a more significant ischemic stroke this week."

Adam, who describes themself as an "independent investigative journalist", "investor" and "policy consultant", sought to support his claim by pointing to footage of Mr Trump dragging his right leg, his bruised hand and medications listed on the president's annual physical report.

Now celebrity psychic and astrologer Inbaal Honigman has given her verdict after reading the president's tarot cards, but suggests it relates to another part of his body.

Speaking exclusively to the Daily Star, she said: "Regarding Trump's health, the moon tarot card indicates that his problem area is around the pelvis.

"This card speaks of potential worries around the president's prostate and intestine. As long as he appears to be his usual weight, things are going well for him physically.

"Around March 2026 there could be hints of some unintentional weight loss, which will spark rumours of a hospital stay. As this is quite a positive card, the expectation would be that Trump will receive treatment and recover well."

"This is about national security, government accountability, and the American people's right to the truth."

How can the U.S. government restore public trust regarding unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) through transparency and offering whistleblower protections?

That was the core, mind-boggling question behind a Sept. 9 congressional House of Representatives hearing, held by the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets.

Representative Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) is chair of that task force, swearing in witnesses that under oath discussed their experiences and knowledge about UAPs, a rebranded term attached, deserved or not, to unidentified flying objects (UFOs), as well as unidentified objects or phenomena in Earth's bodies of water or space.

For too long, UAPs have been "shrouded in secrecy, stigma, and in some cases outright dismissal," Luna said in her opening statement.

"Today, I want to state clearly: this is not science fiction or creating speculation. This is about national security, government accountability, and the American people's right to the truth," said Luna. "Future generations will look back on this moment and ask what we did when presented with the unknown. Did we look away, embarrassed or afraid? Or did we pursue the truth with courage? I intend to be on the side of truth, transparency, and accountability," the lawmaker stated.

A transcript of the hearing and witnesses' prepared testimonies can be read on the U.S. House of Representatives' website.

Space.com asked several experts from leading research groups on UAPs/UFOs concerning the hearing and their take-away thoughts.

"The military witness reports were very good," said Robert Powell, executive board member of the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies in Austin, Texas.

While it may not be apparent to the public or congress, Powell said that anyone who has studied the history of the subject knows that there have been hundreds of such reports by military witnesses that are equally as good.

So how do we move forward?

"Unless Congress is willing to push for the nitty-gritty details" by obtaining full videos, interviewing pilots involved in UAP incidents, and other reported events, "we will not progress," said Powell.

Powell said, in his view, the military will never release the necessary information to establish the presence of a non-human intelligence.

"That's because of their concerns for national security and whether one of our adversaries might learn something from UAP that they could use militarily against us," Powell said. "The resulting tendency to silo all information on UAP prevents moving forward with learning more. Only if Congress allocates funding to the scientific community and academia to study UAP will we make any progress," he concluded.

"I find it frustrating that they, rightly, reiterate the importance of the role science can take in figuring out what is behind UAP, but do not apply it in these hearings."

That's the outlook from Alejandro Rojas, a long-time UFO journalist and a consultant to Enigma, a UAP/UFO sightings alert network.

"We have years of anecdotal sighting reports and claims of hidden government knowledge about alien visitation. What we need is evidence," Rojas said.

Rojas added that he found it also trying that the one organization that has been using science, the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), was pummeled in the hearing, without being represented.

"Having worked in the UFO field for so long, I am sympathetic to their [AARO's] effort. They have shown each step of their work analyzing previous videos, and although it is unpopular to demystify some of these reports, their scientific analyses have been sound," he said.

 




At the recent hearing, "the gripes of committee members came across as being frustrated with the organization that is using science and coming up with answers," sensed Rojas. "However, because they dislike the answers, they blame AARO, when in fact they genuinely do not want scientific analysis to dismantle their preconceived notions."

In the end, Rojas found the hearing disheartening.

"Instead of focusing on real issues and truly championing scientific investigation, the hearing comes across as a very political back-and-forth between the Oversight Committee and the Pentagon," said Rojas. "What gets lost is what we actually need, and that is data gathering and scientific evaluation of that data."

As a consultant with Enigma, Rojas said the group is collecting hundreds of reports, many with videos.

"What we need is a robust, transparent effort to analyze what we are collecting, and to build better sensor systems to gather more and better data on UAP," said Rojas. "If extraterrestrials are visiting us, it is not just the military that would be seeing them."

Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project at Harvard, and director of the Institute for Theory & Computation, said he found the first-hand testimonies at the hearing "to be credible and intriguing."

Loeb's Galileo Project is an endeavor to bring the search for extraterrestrial technological signatures of other star folk from "accidental or anecdotal observations and legends" to the mainstream of crystal-clear, confirmed and systematic scientific research.

"I salute congresswoman Luna for chairing this important discussion within the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets in the U.S. Congress," Loeb said.

But does such a congressional hearing restore public interest in UAP?

"This discussion is not a matter of public relations in a popularity contest, but instead a topic of great relevance for national security and science," responded Loeb. "Once we all see credible evidence about the nature of UAP, we will be able to get to the bottom of it and everyone would agree on what it means."

 




Data collection is the goal of the Galileo Project under Loeb's leadership.

Does the astrophysicist believe that the U.S. government is hiding information? He replied that "as a scientist I respond to evidence and not to what people tell me. Scientific evidence is our best path to new knowledge."

The simplest way to tell the difference between a dogmatist and a genuine scientist, Loeb said, is to flood both of them with scientific-quality data.

"Whereas the dogmatist will shove anomalous data under the carpet of traditional thinking, an open-minded scientist will be thrilled to learn something new with an underlying sense of humility," advised Loeb. "Not only is nature more imaginative than we are, but it also does not care whether we figure it out. The insistence that everything in the sky is either icy rocks or human-made technologies will not rid us of cosmic neighbors, if they exist out there," he concluded.

"Overall, I was pleased with the tone and testimony in the hearing from the witnesses, and the often excellent questions from the Representatives," said Mark Rodeghier, president and scientific director of the Center for UFO Studies in Chicago, Illinois.

"The hearing hopefully provided more impetus to pass the crucial legislation necessary to answer questions we have about possible US government/contractor involvement with UAP that has been hidden all these years," said Rodeghier.

Rodeghier said the witnesses added additional experiences on the record of both UAP sightings and how the aftermath of those has been handled by the military, including treatment of those wishing to speak publicly.

Beyond moving Congress to pass the bills, Rodeghier advised getting witnesses into a SCIF, short for Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. Located several levels beneath the U.S. Capitol, a SCIF is where lawmakers and witnesses hold closed interviews, far from the prying eyes of the public.

"I'm not sure what can be done with it [those interviews], but having it available is important," said Rodeghier.

Another Rodeghier recommendation is to have the head of AARO in a hearing this fall now that he has been on the job for a year. Lastly, there's need to work on getting the appropriate government agencies to provide modest funding for UAP research, which continues to be unavailable, he said.

Michael Cifone is the founding executive director of the Society for UAP Studies, based in Los Angeles, California. The group's mission is not to promote a single narrative but to advance careful scholarship, develop educational frameworks, and advocate for standards of evidence and data transparency.

The recent Congressional hearing on UAPs underscored, once again, "both the importance of the issue and the deep difficulties that have hampered its treatment for decades," said Cifone.

That handling of the topic within the government — whose aim since at least after World War II has been increasingly obsessed with national security and maintaining US military and strategic dominance, feels Cifone, "are guiding principles that are ultimately at odds with the inner operating directives of the sciences themselves: free, open, and therefore democratic exploration of self and world."

"The UAP problem is not a mystery with one answer, but rather a somewhat unstable and chaotic amalgam of many overlapping realities, complicated by the unfortunate facts of the modern bureaucratic national security state," is a view that Cifone basically endorses.

"UAP reports are not a monolith," Cifone advised.

Instead, they are a mixed pool consisting of: (1) misidentified U.S. black projects, where cutting-edge aerospace programs are understandably shrouded in secrecy; (2) adversarial drones and surveillance platforms, which represent a genuine national security challenge; (3) a large number of ordinary misperceptions of balloons, satellites, or atmospheric phenomena; and (4) a small but stubborn residue of anomalous cases that resist explanation.

"This mixture makes the phenomenon difficult to study, not because of some grand cover-up, but because of the dysfunctional way information is handled inside the government," Cifone said.

The UAP hearing, for all its frustrations, said Cifone, "at least signaled that Congress is beginning to take seriously the structural problems that have long clouded this issue."

From a safety standpoint, the "mixture hypothesis" is particularly important, said Cifone. If even a fraction of UAP reports involve advanced adversarial drones or unsafe incursions into U.S. airspace, then society is faced with an aviation and national security challenge that demands systematic response, he said.

"Let's see what data and frameworks we can establish that can handle UAP and associated phenomena/claims, and what philosophical/conceptual challenges remain, and if we're up to the task," Cifone said.

And for the other claims — crashes, bodies, and so on, Cifone concludes, "sure, but where's the beef?"

How can the U.S. government restore public trust regarding unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) through transparency and offering whistleblower protections?

That was the core, mind-boggling question behind a Sept. 9 congressional House of Representatives hearing, held by the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets.

Representative Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) is chair of that task force, swearing in witnesses that under oath discussed their experiences and knowledge about UAPs, a rebranded term attached, deserved or not, to unidentified flying objects (UFOs), as well as unidentified objects or phenomena in Earth's bodies of water or space.

For too long, UAPs have been "shrouded in secrecy, stigma, and in some cases outright dismissal," Luna said in her opening statement.

"Today, I want to state clearly: this is not science fiction or creating speculation. This is about national security, government accountability, and the American people's right to the truth," said Luna. "Future generations will look back on this moment and ask what we did when presented with the unknown. Did we look away, embarrassed or afraid? Or did we pursue the truth with courage? I intend to be on the side of truth, transparency, and accountability," the lawmaker stated.

A transcript of the hearing and witnesses' prepared testimonies can be read on the U.S. House of Representatives' website.

Space.com asked several experts from leading research groups on UAPs/UFOs concerning the hearing and their take-away thoughts.

"The military witness reports were very good," said Robert Powell, executive board member of the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies in Austin, Texas.

While it may not be apparent to the public or congress, Powell said that anyone who has studied the history of the subject knows that there have been hundreds of such reports by military witnesses that are equally as good.

So how do we move forward?

"Unless Congress is willing to push for the nitty-gritty details" by obtaining full videos, interviewing pilots involved in UAP incidents, and other reported events, "we will not progress," said Powell.

Powell said, in his view, the military will never release the necessary information to establish the presence of a non-human intelligence.

"That's because of their concerns for national security and whether one of our adversaries might learn something from UAP that they could use militarily against us," Powell said. "The resulting tendency to silo all information on UAP prevents moving forward with learning more. Only if Congress allocates funding to the scientific community and academia to study UAP will we make any progress," he concluded.

"I find it frustrating that they, rightly, reiterate the importance of the role science can take in figuring out what is behind UAP, but do not apply it in these hearings."

That's the outlook from Alejandro Rojas, a long-time UFO journalist and a consultant to Enigma, a UAP/UFO sightings alert network.

"We have years of anecdotal sighting reports and claims of hidden government knowledge about alien visitation. What we need is evidence," Rojas said.

Rojas added that he found it also trying that the one organization that has been using science, the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), was pummeled in the hearing, without being represented.

"Having worked in the UFO field for so long, I am sympathetic to their [AARO's] effort. They have shown each step of their work analyzing previous videos, and although it is unpopular to demystify some of these reports, their scientific analyses have been sound," he said.

 




At the recent hearing, "the gripes of committee members came across as being frustrated with the organization that is using science and coming up with answers," sensed Rojas. "However, because they dislike the answers, they blame AARO, when in fact they genuinely do not want scientific analysis to dismantle their preconceived notions."

In the end, Rojas found the hearing disheartening.

"Instead of focusing on real issues and truly championing scientific investigation, the hearing comes across as a very political back-and-forth between the Oversight Committee and the Pentagon," said Rojas. "What gets lost is what we actually need, and that is data gathering and scientific evaluation of that data."

As a consultant with Enigma, Rojas said the group is collecting hundreds of reports, many with videos.

"What we need is a robust, transparent effort to analyze what we are collecting, and to build better sensor systems to gather more and better data on UAP," said Rojas. "If extraterrestrials are visiting us, it is not just the military that would be seeing them."

Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project at Harvard, and director of the Institute for Theory & Computation, said he found the first-hand testimonies at the hearing "to be credible and intriguing."

Loeb's Galileo Project is an endeavor to bring the search for extraterrestrial technological signatures of other star folk from "accidental or anecdotal observations and legends" to the mainstream of crystal-clear, confirmed and systematic scientific research.

"I salute congresswoman Luna for chairing this important discussion within the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets in the U.S. Congress," Loeb said.

But does such a congressional hearing restore public interest in UAP?

"This discussion is not a matter of public relations in a popularity contest, but instead a topic of great relevance for national security and science," responded Loeb. "Once we all see credible evidence about the nature of UAP, we will be able to get to the bottom of it and everyone would agree on what it means."

 




Data collection is the goal of the Galileo Project under Loeb's leadership.

Does the astrophysicist believe that the U.S. government is hiding information? He replied that "as a scientist I respond to evidence and not to what people tell me. Scientific evidence is our best path to new knowledge."

The simplest way to tell the difference between a dogmatist and a genuine scientist, Loeb said, is to flood both of them with scientific-quality data.

"Whereas the dogmatist will shove anomalous data under the carpet of traditional thinking, an open-minded scientist will be thrilled to learn something new with an underlying sense of humility," advised Loeb. "Not only is nature more imaginative than we are, but it also does not care whether we figure it out. The insistence that everything in the sky is either icy rocks or human-made technologies will not rid us of cosmic neighbors, if they exist out there," he concluded.

"Overall, I was pleased with the tone and testimony in the hearing from the witnesses, and the often excellent questions from the Representatives," said Mark Rodeghier, president and scientific director of the Center for UFO Studies in Chicago, Illinois.

"The hearing hopefully provided more impetus to pass the crucial legislation necessary to answer questions we have about possible US government/contractor involvement with UAP that has been hidden all these years," said Rodeghier.

Rodeghier said the witnesses added additional experiences on the record of both UAP sightings and how the aftermath of those has been handled by the military, including treatment of those wishing to speak publicly.

Beyond moving Congress to pass the bills, Rodeghier advised getting witnesses into a SCIF, short for Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. Located several levels beneath the U.S. Capitol, a SCIF is where lawmakers and witnesses hold closed interviews, far from the prying eyes of the public.

"I'm not sure what can be done with it [those interviews], but having it available is important," said Rodeghier.

Another Rodeghier recommendation is to have the head of AARO in a hearing this fall now that he has been on the job for a year. Lastly, there's need to work on getting the appropriate government agencies to provide modest funding for UAP research, which continues to be unavailable, he said.

Michael Cifone is the founding executive director of the Society for UAP Studies, based in Los Angeles, California. The group's mission is not to promote a single narrative but to advance careful scholarship, develop educational frameworks, and advocate for standards of evidence and data transparency.

The recent Congressional hearing on UAPs underscored, once again, "both the importance of the issue and the deep difficulties that have hampered its treatment for decades," said Cifone.

That handling of the topic within the government — whose aim since at least after World War II has been increasingly obsessed with national security and maintaining US military and strategic dominance, feels Cifone, "are guiding principles that are ultimately at odds with the inner operating directives of the sciences themselves: free, open, and therefore democratic exploration of self and world."

"The UAP problem is not a mystery with one answer, but rather a somewhat unstable and chaotic amalgam of many overlapping realities, complicated by the unfortunate facts of the modern bureaucratic national security state," is a view that Cifone basically endorses.

"UAP reports are not a monolith," Cifone advised.

Instead, they are a mixed pool consisting of: (1) misidentified U.S. black projects, where cutting-edge aerospace programs are understandably shrouded in secrecy; (2) adversarial drones and surveillance platforms, which represent a genuine national security challenge; (3) a large number of ordinary misperceptions of balloons, satellites, or atmospheric phenomena; and (4) a small but stubborn residue of anomalous cases that resist explanation.

"This mixture makes the phenomenon difficult to study, not because of some grand cover-up, but because of the dysfunctional way information is handled inside the government," Cifone said.

The UAP hearing, for all its frustrations, said Cifone, "at least signaled that Congress is beginning to take seriously the structural problems that have long clouded this issue."

From a safety standpoint, the "mixture hypothesis" is particularly important, said Cifone. If even a fraction of UAP reports involve advanced adversarial drones or unsafe incursions into U.S. airspace, then society is faced with an aviation and national security challenge that demands systematic response, he said.

"Let's see what data and frameworks we can establish that can handle UAP and associated phenomena/claims, and what philosophical/conceptual challenges remain, and if we're up to the task," Cifone said.

And for the other claims — crashes, bodies, and so on, Cifone concludes, "sure, but where's the beef?"

          / CBS News
        

False claims, conspiracy theories and posts naming people with no connection to the incident spread rapidly across social media in the aftermath of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing on Wednesday, some amplified and fueled by AI tools.

CBS News identified 10 posts by Grok, X's AI chatbot, that misidentified the suspect before his identity, now known to be southern Utah resident Tyler Robinson, was released. Grok eventually generated a response saying it had incorrectly identified the suspect, but by then, posts featuring the wrong person's face and name were already circulating across X.

The chatbot also generated altered "enhancements" of photos released by the FBI. One such photo was reposted by the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Utah, which later posted an update saying, "this appears to be an AI enhanced photo" that distorted the clothing and facial features. 

One AI-enhanced image portrayed a man appearing much older than Robinson, who is 22. An AI-generated video that smoothed out the suspect's features and jumbled his shirt design was posted by an X user with more than 2 million followers and was reposted thousands of times.

On Friday morning, after Utah Gov. Spencer Cox announced that the suspect in custody was Robinson, Grok's replies to X users' inquiries about him were contradictory. One Grok post said Robinson was a registered Republican, while others reported he was a nonpartisan voter. Voter registration records indicate Robinson is not affiliated with a political party.	

CBS News also identified a dozen instances where Grok said that Kirk was alive the day following his death. Other Grok responses gave a false assassination date, labeled the FBI's reward offer a "hoax" and said that reports about Kirk's death "remain conflicting" even after his death had been confirmed. 

Most generative AI tools produce results based on probability, which can make it challenging for them to provide accurate information in real time as events unfold, S. Shyam Sundar, a professor at Penn State University and the director of the university's Center for Socially Responsible Artificial Intelligence, told CBS News.

"They look at what is the most likely next word or next passage," Sundar said. "It's not based on fact checking. It's not based on any kind of reportage on the scene. It's more based on the likelihood of this event occurring, and if there's enough out there that might question his death, it might pick up on some of that."

X did not respond to a request for comment about the false information Grok was posting. 

Meanwhile, the AI-powered search engine Perplexity's X bot described the shooting as a "hypothetical scenario" in a since-deleted post, and suggested a White House statement on Kirk's death was fabricated.

Perplexity's spokesperson told CBS News that "accurate AI is the core technology we are building and central to the experience in all of our products," but that "Perplexity never claims to be 100% accurate."

Another spokesperson added the X bot is not up to date with improvements the company has made to its technology, and the company has since removed the bot from X.

Google's AI Overview, a summary of search results that sometimes appears at the top of searches, also provided inaccurate information. The AI Overview for a search late Thursday evening for Hunter Kozak, the last person to ask Kirk a question before he was killed, incorrectly identified him as the person of interest the FBI was looking for. By Friday morning, the false information no longer appeared for the same search.

"The vast majority of the queries seeking information on this topic return high quality and accurate responses," a Google spokesperson told CBS News. "Given the rapidly evolving nature of this news, it's possible that our systems misinterpreted web content or missed some context, as all Search features can do given the scale of the open web."

Sundar told CBS News that people tend to perceive AI as being less biased or more reliable than someone online who they don't know. 

"We don't think of machines as being partisan or bias or wanting to sow seeds of dissent," Sundar said. "If it's just a social media friend or some somebody on the contact list that's sent something on your feed with unknown pedigree ... chances are people trust the machine more than they do the random human."

Misinformation may also be coming from foreign sources, according to Cox, Utah's governor, who said in a press briefing on Thursday that foreign adversaries including Russia and China have bots that "are trying to instill disinformation and encourage violence." Cox urged listeners to spend less time on social media. 

"I would encourage you to ignore those and turn off those streams, and to spend a little more time with our families," he said.
