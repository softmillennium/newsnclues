Carlo Ancelotti is well aware of his short-term situation with the Brazilian national team as they prepare for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. More news: Carlo Ancelotti Sends Clear Message On Neymar's Place With Brazil Squad He cemented his legacy with Real Madrid, winning multiple UEFA Champions League trophies while showcasing consistency with his winning formula. Despite the limited time, he hopes to continue beyond 2026. "Preparing the World Cup for Brazil is something special," he said, via ESPN Brasil. I have no problem if the CBF wants to continue. More news: Neymar Breaks Silence on Not Getting Called Up by Brazil Ancelotti is four matches into his coaching stint with Brazil. The team has had defensive stability, only conceding once, while scoring four goals in their June and September contests. Brazil secured its ticket to the 2026 FIFA World Cup after beating Paraguay 1-0 in June. The national team's all-time leading goalscorer has been absent since tearing his ACL in October 2023. He has since dealt with fitness issues, preventing him from returning to the pitch for Brazil aside from club matches with Santos FC. They went even with Colombia and Uruguay for the third spot while trailing Ecuador by one point and Argentina by 10 points. Brazil will prepare for two friendly matches in October. They will first face South Korea on Oct. 10 at 7 a.m. ET before going away to face Bolivia on Oct. 14 at 6:30 a.m. For all the latest Soccer news and rumors, head over to Newsweek Sports.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It happened with both Pakistan and Congo in a similar timeframe and ahead of the 2018 World Cup, the Kuwait Football Association were banned. But the suspension , which came when they were second in Group G, meant they were prohibited from playing their remaining three fixtures - away games against Myanmar and South Korea and a home clash vs Laos. All three games were awarded as 3-0 defeats, which meant they finished a point behind second placed Lebanon and also missed out on the 2019 Asian Cup qualifiers. A statement confirmed that "the Kuwait Parliament has adopted a new Sports Law of Kuwait, which replaces all the previous ones and has been amended in order to be fully compliant with the FIFA Statutes and requirements." Shortly after, Kuwait, who had a sole appearance in the World Cup in 1982, hosted the Gulf Cup shortly after they were allowed to resume. Ahead of the 2026 World Cup, FIFA officially imposed two 3-0 forfeits to Equatorial Guinea over the use of ineligible player who is actually their record goalscorer. Former Middlesbrough and Birmingham forward Emilio Nsue scored the winning goals in games against Namibia and Liberia but was hit by a six-month ban from international football after it was ruled the Spain youth international had not been formally cleared to play for the African side. Nsue was cleared to play upon a successful appeal for African football governing body Feguifut, but Equatorial Guinea were not able to win back the points after Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) dismissed the case.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Men's National Team righted itself after an underachieving performance against the Korea Republic in Harrison, N.J. by registering a solid 2-0 triumph over Japan in Columbus, Ohio. But there are a couple of issues that won't go away any time soon. When the Americans have to play Mexico, whether it is in a friendly, Concacaf Gold Cup or World Cup qualifier, the crowd has been known to be partisan to El Tri (outside of Ohio). Many Mexican fans don't get opportunities to watch their heroes play live and when the team comes to town, whether it is Los Angeles, Chicago or Charlotte, N.C., the fans will show up in droves. For many teams, the preferred city is their nation's capital. Given their success and popularity, the U.S. women many times will play in front of pro-American audiences, many, if not most are sellouts. As for other cities and venues, modern transportation has allowed fans to get from here to there in a decent amount of time. Like it or not, playing in front of non-partisan crowds at home will be with for the team to contend with for the foreseeable future. If there is an upside in playing in front of "enemy" spectators at home, it could toughen up the players. Starting with a 1-0 loss to Canada in Newark, N.J. on Nov. 28, 1885, a U.S. men's nation side has played 30 times in the region and has recorded a 9-12-9 mark. But let's put the current results under a microscope. The Americans are 1-7-3 in their last 11 matches there, including that 2-0 defeat at Sports Illustrated Stadium. The U.S. has been shut out in eight of those matches, scoring only three times. That 11-game run also includes a devastating 2-0 defeat to Costa Rica in a vital World Cup qualifier on Sept. 1, 2017, that helped seal the Americans' fate of missing the 2018 tournament in Russia. We don't know if U.S. Soccer will ever bring a qualifier back to the area, but they are certainly good reasons not to. An interesting note: The last time the USMNT played in New York City proper was a 3-3 draw in an international friendly before 10,108 spectators at Yankee Stadium on Sept. 15, 1968. Tuesday will be the 57th anniversary of that encounter. Not much is known about this game, but some of the names might be familiar: defender Bob Gansler, who coached the U.S. national team at the 1990 World Cup, Willy Roy, a scoring terror in the early days of modern U.S. professional soccer, who scored a goal at Yankee Stadium. Both men are in the National Soccer Hall of fame. NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY: How the USMNT has fared in the metro area - Front Row Soccer Incredible as it may sound, there are no stadiums east of the Hudson River in New York that are natural venues for soccer. But they are baseball parks and need to be reconfigured for soccer. And fans necessarily get the optimum view of a soccer game. And in this day and age, with so many soccer-specific stadiums in Major League Soccer and in lower division leagues, placing a national team in a baseball stadium would not be a good idea. But there is a solution just over the horizon. In 2027, NYCFC is planning to unveil its new stadium in Willets Point, Queens, adjacent to Citi Field (barring building delays that New York City is well known for). It will be a state-of-the-art facility. Moreover, it will be a soccer-specific stadium, and fit for a national team, the USMNT, in the city. After almost six decades, it is about time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Looking to snag tickets to 2026's World Cup, where 48 nations' soccer teams will battle in stadiums around the U.S., Mexico and Canada? FIFA, soccer's global governing body, said on its website that, due to expected high demand, tickets will be released in phases. And Wednesday, Sept. 10, was the early-ticketing process's first day. “With just 10 months to go until the FIFA World Cup 26 kicks off, we are excited to launch the first phase of ticket sales for the tournament,” Heimo Schirgi, FIFA World Cup 2026 chief operating officer, said in a Sept. 3 news release on FIFA's website. “This marks a momentous milestone as we build up to this historic event, and we look forward to millions of fans joining us in North America next June.” The presale draw is subject to rules at FIFA.com/tickets. After a randomized selection process, successful applicants will be notified by email beginning on Sept. 29 of a day and time slot to buy tickets — subject to availability. FIFA said a successful draw application does not guarantee tickets will be available to buy during the time slot. The World Cup will play out at 16 stadiums from June 11 to July 19. FIFA said there will be single-match tickets to all 104 matches made available, as well as venue-specific and team-specific tickets. The Athletic reported that FIFA said it will use dynamic pricing, in which ticket prices will vary depending on demand and that New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has taken issue with that approach. People who are not eligible to be part of the Visa presale draw, were not successful in getting tickets in the draw or want to make more purchases will be able to in subsequent sales phases, FIFA said. Expected to be Oct. 27-31 is the early ticket draw. It will also involved what FIFA said is a randomized selection process in which applicants receive a time slot to buy tickets, subject to availability. In 2026, closer to the tournament, there can be last-minute sales. Other notable venues include Mexico City's Estadio Azteca, where legends Pele of Brazil and Diego Maradona of Argentina had stand-out performances in the 1970 and 1986 World Cups, respectively. Among questions ahead of 2026's World Cup is whether icon Lionel Messi of Argentina — who had an astounding career playing for Spain's titans FC Barcelona — will play.</p>

He was granted the unique opportunity to report on the men's basketball team's journey to the Final Four in Houston for FAU Owls Nest during March Madness, consistently striving to grow as a sports journalist. Carlo Ancelotti was honest about Neymar's place with the Brazilian national team as they prepare for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Ancelotti took over the reins in June but hasn't been able to bring the superstar forward back due to fitness issues. Shortly after Brazil concluded their qualifiers, he made it clear about his chances on being with the team for the World Cup. "We are not going to observe how Neymar plays, obviously. Everyone knows his talent," Ancelotti told ESPN Brasil's Pedro Ivo Almeida. I spoke with him, and I said 'you have time to prepare in the best way to be there and help the team try to do their best in the World Cup.'" The manager went as much to say that he would be in the attacking midfield or be up top as a striker, taking into account his current condition at age 33. "[I would select him] as an attacking midfielder or striker, he has to play centrally, he can't play on the outside because modern football needs forwards who have physical quality, it's very important. He can play as an attacking midfielder without problems." They went even with Colombia and Uruguay for the third spot while trailing Ecuador by one point and Argentina by 10 points.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea agreed personal terms with Mohammed Kudus and planned to sign him early for the Club World Cup, but their player plus cash deal was rejected according to The Athletic. The Blues had a busy summer in which they made six signings, five of which were attackers as the frontline underwent a major overhaul. Joao Pedro has made the biggest impact, whilst Argentine duo Alejandro Garnacho and Facundo Buonanotte could make their debut against Brentford on Saturday. Chelsea were linked with Kudus earlier this summer, and reportedly had a player plus cash deal rejected by West Ham for the Ghana international. Chelsea seemingly then switched their attention to Xavi Simons, but despite strong interest the Blues never made an offer and he too ended up at Tottenham. This wasn't the first time Chelsea were close to signing Kudus, and they also agreed terms with him when he was at Ajax in 2023.

It wasn't all a disaster for Chelsea as they ended up signing Cole Palmer that summer, but this is now two occasions in which a deal for Kudus has been so close yet so far.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Neymar has not played for Brazil since October 2023, when he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Since his recovery, the 33-year-old has moved to boyhood club Santos but has been excluded from both of Ancelotti's squads so far amid ongoing injury issues. It was originally stated that Neymar had been left out of the September squad due to injury, which the striker disputed, and Ancelotti later confirmed he had been left out due to “technical” reasons. Neymar, who is Brazil's all-time top scorer with 79 goals, has the second most caps for his nation (behind Cafu), with 128 appearances. He has scored six goals and registered three assists since returning to Santos, but Ancelotti said it will be Neymar's fitness, not his talent, that determines if he will be at next year's World Cup. "We are not going to observe how Neymar plays, obviously. Everyone knows his talent," Ancelotti told ESPN Brasil. "In modern football, to take advantage of his talent, the player has to be in good physical condition. If he is in his best physical condition, he will have no problems being in the national team. I spoke with him, and I said, 'You have time to prepare in the best way to be there and help the team try to do their best in the World Cup'." Ancelotti was not disheartened by that result, though, and is still eagerly anticipating his first World Cup as a manager. "Preparing the World Cup for Brazil is something special," he said. After the World Cup, everything is open. I have no problem if the CBF wants to continue. It would be nice [to stay until 2030]."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Nerazzurri look for vital away points to revive their campaign. In a high stakes contest that could have huge repercussions in the 2025 Serie-A title race, Italian giants Juventus and Inter Milan will lock horns on Saturday evening. With both teams looking to dethrone Napoli for national supremacy, this match-up holds huge importance. Last season, an average campaign saw Juve finish fourth in Serie-A – two spots behind Inter. Here's all you need to know about the odds for the top scorer, top assist provider and much more – as per BetMGM: Inter's leading marksman Lautaro Martinez is set to lead the line yet again, with +360 odds of being the first goal-scorer and favorable +170 odds of scoring a goal on Saturday. He is closely followed by Juve's Jonathan David – who has +400 odds of scoring first. Jonathan David's elite vision and hold-up play have given him favorable +525 odds of being the top assist provider on the money line. Kenan Yildiz matches him at +525 due to his quality deliveries in the box. While Weston McKennie (+550) and Denzel Dumfries (+575) have an innate ability to make runs and nail the deciding pass, Filip Kostic is not too far behind (+575). David has scored 1 goal in 2 Serie-A matches so far this season, and also notched a goal for Canada during the international break. Owing to his consistently good performances for Juve and his ability to set up the play for his teammates, the 25-year-old has been given favorable odds to score or assist on Saturday. With well over 100 goals and 25 assists for Inter in his Italian league career alone, Martinez is a proven match-winner for the 2023-24 champions. Yildiz has a knack of occupying key spaces on the left, particularly when Juve are in their 3-4-2-1 shape. The 20-year-old attacker already has 2 assists to his name this season, both of which came in Le Zebre's 2-0 rout of Parma on the opening weekend. He is closely followed by Jonathan David, Kenan Yildiz, Marcus Thuram and Dusan Vlahovic. And if you're a fan of Roger Federer, Lionel Messi and/or Stephen Curry – I'm your guy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid remains in full control of La Liga after three wins from three, but there's a bigger story looming over the Bernabeu — the possible early comeback of Jude Bellingham. Bellingham's absence has been felt keenly in the Spanish capital. The midfielder has not featured this season after undergoing surgery to repair a long-standing left shoulder injury that first flared up in November 2023 against Rayo Vallecano. For months, he soldiered on, playing with a heavy brace for both club and country, but after the Club World Cup this summer, the decision was made to operate. His rehabilitation, however, appears to be progressing faster than expected. It was during his pre-match press conference that Alonso revealed the latest on Madrid's midfield engine — and his comments offered a glimmer of hope to Madridistas. “I want to be a little optimistic and hope he's ready before October,” the Spanish manager said. “He's doing partial training, without contact, because we are protecting him. Jude is making a great effort in his recovery. Let's see if he can take steps forward next week, and when we feel good, we'll be waiting for him.” The news will be music to the ears of supporters, as it means there is now a real chance of seeing Bellingham feature in a Madrid shirt again this month. While the clash against Espanyol on September 20 may come too soon, the away trip to Levante three days later is seen as a more realistic comeback option. And of course, all eyes are on the derby against Atletico Madrid on September 27, which could mark his first start since surgery if recovery continues smoothly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Portugal star will hand Gianni Infantino the perfect publicity coup if he does play in America for the first time in more than 10 years, having already begun cosying up to Donald Trump After more headline evidence this week of the extreme nature of American gun violence, some may conclude that the answer is no. Nine months out from the opening game, it is now almost impossible to ignore this. But believe it or not statistics suggest more than 300 people will have been shot in America last Wednesday alone. The same number will also be shot on Friday, Saturday, every day next week, and every day of World Cup year. On average 127 of these unnamed, largely non-famous people not called things such as the superstar influencer Charlie Kirk will die each day. Within this, youth gun deaths will be both alarmingly high and a register of social injustice: a disproportionate 46% of all young people shot will be black. So maybe the events of Wednesday really do suggest America isn't a fitting World Cup host. Maybe it hasn't been for a while, as members of the African media suggested while questioning Gianni Infantino in Nairobi a few days ago, expressing alarm at the hostile policies of the Fifa president's special friend Donald Trump. Happily Infantino cleared this up on the spot. Today I feel like a concerned black African football tourist. With the benefit of this unique insight I, Gianni, have decided it's all fine, so carry on. You may still have concerns, or consider Infantino's assurances are worth exactly what you might expect from a person who seems to be composed entirely from a cylinder of reconstituted human inauthenticity crammed, kebab-meat-style, into a navy blue suit. Or that Fifa is already complicit in this state of alarm. The World Cup will offer a multibillion-dollar boost and a gloss of pure sportswashing to a regime that has used immigration theatrics to alarm its inhabitants and imposed brutal visa curbs on people from the wrong kind of competing nation. But there is at least one shaft of light here. Before anyone gets too worried about travelling to America for the World Cup there was a suggestion this week that one highly influential person may be about to buck this trend. Enter: Cristiano Ronaldo, who has the chance to demonstrate that it's finally safe to go back in the water, a year into Trump 2.0. It has been a good couple of weeks for Ronaldo. First he was given full superstar hysteria treatment during the Saudi Super Cup in Hong Kong, which included being mobbed during a surprise visit to a museum in Tsim Sha Tsui. Surely an elite fitness powder emporium, or a skyscraper made entirely from yak fur and parmesan cheese? And as of Wednesday Ronaldo is now in line for a return to the US after an unexplained 12 years away. According to a story first published in the Athletic, Portugal are in talks to play a friendly against the US next March. Ronaldo still has a lifetime contract with Nike and assorted big-ticket endorsement deals. He even put his name to an NFT collaboration which has now collapsed into legal chaos, with Ronaldo at one point a named party in a class action suit, which may or may not be a related factor, nobody really knows. What is certain is his decade-long absence from the largest consumer economy in the world, no tours, no brand-building appearances, no Major League Soccer contract, has left millions of dollars on the table, for a Ronaldo-industrial complex that definitely likes millions of dollars. In fact it all seems to have been a terrible misunderstanding. But his absence coincides directly with the appearance of allegations in 2017, always vehemently denied, that Ronaldo sexually assaulted a teacher called Kathryn Mayorga in Las Vegas in 2009, and later offered a no-admission no-guilt payoff to make the whole thing stop. The case was reopened in 2018, ran on to 2022, and has now, it seems, died a death. Pre-season tours at his various clubs over this period stayed away from the States. And now it seems the waters may be clearing. And it is, let's face it, hard not to associate this with a change in voice, power dynamics, names at the top. Trump knows what it is to suffer historical allegations that just won't go away. Either way, in June there was an overt cosying up as Trump was presented with a CR7 shirt via the Portuguese European council president, António Costa, at the G7 summit in Canada (on it Ronaldo had inscribed “To president Donald J. Trump, Playing for Peace”, pandering very obviously to the aspirant Ballon de Peace winner). And this really is a late-career crunch time for Ronaldo, 40, still a goalscoring machine, and with a chance to dip a toe in those waters before the World Cup, where he really just needs to be present to energise both the tournament and his own brand legacy. At the Club World Cup this summer he was massively present despite not taking part, anecdotally the most high-profile, obsessively admired footballer most local people could name. He is also deeply now, the most prominent single catalyst of a transformation of the sport into a brand-driven global platform, a nation state arm of power, an endlessly amplified celebrity content machine. For all that, it is still hard to get your head around the basic question of why exactly Ronaldo is quite so famous. Why is he so far ahead of everyone else in this? He embodies its obsessions: self-made triumph, motivational success, bodily obsession, porn-like aesthetics. A hyper-advanced robot replicant at the interstellar fleet captain's ball. This is often couched in a weird kind of reverence. “For most of my life I've always been worried I wouldn't be able to see Ronaldo,” one member of the Saudi Cup crowd told the South China Morning Post. Another said: “I like Ronaldo because of his values, what he stands for, it's very respectable.” Success, attainment, compacted into a single lighted square. Ronaldo also got there first, colonised that space, understood his own power before anyone else. And now he has a chance, should the stars align, to breach the final consumer frontier, to conquer America decisively next summer, decks finally clear and with a president on hand who will be very interested in any hint of a brand-building collab. Call me cynical, paranoid, conspiracy-prone but it seems inconceivable there hasn't been some kind of pre-chat, a feeling-out, a focus-grouping of what it may mean, optics-wise, good and bad, finally to get Ronaldo on that stage. There are so many strange and manipulative aspects to America's public contortions right now, so many aspects that seem out of control, leading right into a World Cup where even the logo looks mildly sinister, a strange black cancerous date stamp oozing out from beneath that iconic, throbbingly veined golden trophy.</p>
