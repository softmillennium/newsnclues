The 23-year-old Collignon appeared to have lost momentum after a bright opening set in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with De Minaur, but he dug deep and battled through cramps to earn the first Top 10 win of his career. ‚ÄúI think when you play for your country there is no pain,‚Äù said Collignon, who also defeated Casper Ruud last month at the US Open, in his on-court interview. ‚ÄúWe always have great players, and this is unbelievable I think for a small country like ours.‚Äù Bergs later sank Jordan Thompson 7-6(4), 6-4 to cap a perfect day for Belgium. A three-time Davis Cup finalist, including in 2015 and 2017, Belgium will now look to Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen to wrap up victory on Saturday, when the experienced doubles duo takes on John Peers and Rinky Hijikata. ‚ÄúIt feels great for the team,‚Äù said Bergs after his win against Thompson.

Playing at the WTA 250 event in Sao Paulo, she knocked out No. 7 seed Leolia Jeanjena in straight sets and backed up the win with a 6-1, 6-0 win over Slovak qualifier Martina Okalova to book her spot in the last eight.‚ÄúI was focusing on every point, especially playing against Alex Eala,‚Äù Tjen said. ‚ÄúWe all know that she can come back at any time, and I was just trying to focus and stay in it until the end.‚ÄùWaiting for her there was an in-form Eala, fresh off her first WTA 125K title run at the Guadalajara 125 Open earlier this month.
