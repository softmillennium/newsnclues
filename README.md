This is essentially a website with daily news trends, headlines and articles in various categories. 
Its main purpose is to have an easy access to latest aggregated and summarized articles.
However, the uploaded csv files contain latest daily raw article data may also be used as input to train AI models on latest news content.
For example, such models may then used to:
<ul>
<li>calculate accurate sentiment analysis</li>
<li>find aggregated and balanced info on topics of interest</li>
<li>time based news analysis in various categories or topics</li>
</ul>

Mainly as a curiosity, I also generate daily news boradcast video on my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@news_n_clues 
Entire video content is 100% AI driven and generated without any human supervision.

If you are interested in purchasing my code (Python) for automatically generating  html, video and more - send me a note!
