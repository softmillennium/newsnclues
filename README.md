This is essentially a website with daily news trends, headlines and articles in various categories. 
Its main purpose is to have an easy access to latest aggregated and summarized articles.
However, it may also be used as input data to train AI models on latest news article data.
Such models may be used to calculate accurate sentiment analysis or find aggregated and balanced info on topics of interest - especially for those interested in scientific knowledge.

I also generate daily news boradcast video to my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@news_n_clues 
Entire video content is 100% AI driven and generated without any human supervision.

If you are a news outlet or another entity interested in purchasing or licensing my code (Python) for automatically generating  html, video and more - send me a note!
