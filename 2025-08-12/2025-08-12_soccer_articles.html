                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup saw 32 teams compete for supremacy at various sites throughout the United States. Chelsea defeated Paris St. Germain for the championship. The Panini Prizm set commemorates the event with a 200-card base set that will be covered by a variety of colorful Prizm parallels and features clubs from North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Every hobby box guarantees five numbered Prizm parallels (such as Purple Pandora /49, Multicolor Mojo /25, and hobby-exclusive Gold Vinyl /1) and eight additional Prizms. There are four autograph sets in the product: Signers include Endrick, Kylian Mbappe, Samu Aghehowa, Luiz Henrique, Savinho, and Thaigo Silva. Collectors can expect 12 inserts per hobby box, and common themes from Prizm releases in other sports can be found here as well. Color Blast Duals, Prizmatic, and En Fuego make an appearance. The Panini Prizm FIFA Club World Cup checklist and team set lists will be posted once made available by the manufacturer, likely close to the release date.

The FIFA World Cup 2026 is calling for more than 65,000 volunteers to help out in the soccer tournament's 16 host cities. New Englanders can volunteer at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, where the Boston matches will be played, organizers said. Other Boston-area volunteers might be stationed at local hotels and airports. Prospective volunteers will also have to pass a background check and attend volunteer team tryouts. All volunteers must commit to eight shifts between June 11 and July 19, 2026, organizers said. You can apply to be a volunteer on the FIFA website. Volunteers will receive an official World Cup 26 volunteer uniform, meals and refreshments, an exclusive reward and recognition items, and a volunteer certificate for their service, organizers said. More information can be found on the Boston FIFA World Cup 2026 website. Tickets to watch the matches can be purchased starting on Sept. 10.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Caicedo returned home to Ecuador over the summer and was greeted like a national hero. “People stopped me in the street,” Caicedo told Chelsea's website. “It was incredible seeing my country and how happy people were watching me win the Club World Cup. My family also are proud of me, and I enjoyed being there a lot.” Now back at Cobham, Caicedo has shifted his focus to the 2025/26 season. “I appreciate that and it's a motivation for me,” he said. Caicedo knows that the coming Premier League season will be as demanding as ever, but he is confident that Chelsea can make their mark. “I just want to start the season really well,” he said. “For sure, it will be an incredible and tough season also, because we know the Premier League is always tough, but we are going to do well.” Chelsea have been busy in the transfer market, but they're still negotiating deals for Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho and RB Leipzig forward Xavi Simons.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite playing a key role in Chelsea's Club World Cup win this summer, Robert Sánchez is still deemed the weak link in the Blues' roster. Chelsea will face competition from Manchester United if they are to sign a world-class player in that position. RMC Sport has reported (translated from French) "Gianluigi Donnarumma is not among the PSG players selected to play in the European Super Cup against Tottenham this Wednesday "The Italian goalkeeper is being urged to find a new club, following the arrival of Lucas Chevalier from Lille... Chelsea and Manchester United have inquired about the goalkeeper's situation in recent hours." Donnarumma played a key role in PSG's Champions League win last season and is regarded as one of the best keepers in the world. However, his contract expires next summer, and the French side has already signed a replacement for him. The highly rated 23-year-old, Lucas Chevalier, was signed from LOSC Lille for $47 million this summer. This has made Donnarumma surplus to requirements. United, on the other hand, finished a lowly 15th in English soccer's top flight last season. However, they lost in the final of that competition to Tottenham Hotspur. Both Chelsea and the Red Devils could do with a new keeper. Onana is also injured, which means that Altay Bayındır will likely start the season as United's first choice. Therefore, Donnarumma should hold out for a move to Stamford Bridge. The content on this site is for entertainment and educational purposes only.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The summer tournament has distorted Madrid's plans ahead of the 2025–26 season, with only one fixture arranged before their La Liga opener. The club were unsuccessful in their efforts to postpone their first game of the league season at home to Osasuna, but will have a couple of extra days to prepare with the fixture scheduled for next Tuesday. Thus, the new season will merely be a week away when they kick-off in Innsbruck. Xabi Alonso has named a strong travelling squad for their Austria trip, and here's how you can watch WSG Tirol vs. Real Madrid on TV and live stream. Supporters around the world can tune into Real Madrid's sole preseason friendly of the summer via Real Madrid TV. Real Madrid are a week away from the start of the 2025–26 season, with Osasuna, who finished ninth in La Liga last season and have proven to be tricky opposition in recent years, their first opponents. Alonso has a fairly tame start to his tenure, with his team taking on the newly-promoted Real Oviedo on Matchweek 2 before clashes against Mallorca, Real Sociedad and Espanyol.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At present, Russia remain suspended from competing in international football and instead have been playing unofficial friendly fixtures against the likes of Belarus, Nigeria, Zambia and Grenada in recent times. The suspension was announced by FIFA and UEFA in May 2022 amid the invasion of Ukraine and a number of European associations refusing to play Russia. Russia appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport but were unsuccessful in their efforts - though in March The Independent reported that "moves are currently happening to get Russia back into football". For the upcoming 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada, eight countries were banned from competing in qualifying for a multitude of reasons. But only three have been blocked from World Cup participation because of a political element. In 2022, Russia had progressed to play-offs for World Cup qualifying but their tie with Poland was cancelled and their opponents received a bye to the next round. They had finished top of their qualifying group for Euro 92 but received the suspension just 10 days before and were replaced by Denmark, who went on to win the competition. The second World Cup host, South Africa put on a memorable festival of football in 2010 but they were banned by FIFA in 1961 during the period of racial apartheid. The ban was lifted in 1963 following a visit from hen-FIFA President Stanley Rous and there was talk of South African FA proposing playing an all-white team for the 1966 World Cup and team made up of back players four years later. The idea was rejected and the South African FA was suspended by FIFA in 1965 and later expelled two years later when Joao Havelange became FIFA president.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Luis Enrique has not been given a touchline ban for the UEFA Super Cup, despite his apparent 'slap' on Joao Pedro at the Club World Cup. That means he'll be in situ in his technical area as usual when the Champions League winners face Europa League champions Spurs on Wednesday night in Italy. Enrique's 'slap' was another major flashpoint of the game in which Joao Neves was sent off for pulling the hair of Marc Cucurella. After the final whistle, players and coaches from both sides came together in an altercation, with Enrique also involved. Luis Enrique made contact with Joao Pedro's face in angry scenes at the Club World Cup final During the melee, Enrique appeared to use his hand to make contact with Pedro in what some have termed a slap. Enrique subsequently tried to explain his actions, claiming he was attempting to act as a peacekeeper. It is a situation that can be avoided by everyone,' said the PSG boss. I am going to prevent my players from going any further in that brawl and from then on there is pushing and shoving from everyone. 'I think that is not the best thing to do. When asked about the incident with Enrique after full-time, Pedro said: 'We're world champions and that's what matters. Both teams wanted to win and that happens.

Coral and Ladbrokes owner Entain has revealed a surge in online gaming as popular sporting events such as Wimbledon and the men's football Club World Cup reeled in punters. This was 6% higher than the same period a year ago, at constant currency rates. Both the volume of players and the value of sales increased, which Entain said reflected an improved experience for customers as well as previous changes to gambling rules starting to level out. The FIFA Club World Cup final, which saw Chelsea beat PSG, was the most bet-on football match of 2025 for Entain's brands, with strong engagement coming from Brazil, Spain and the US. Entain nonetheless reported a pre-tax loss of £96 million for the first half, swinging from a £13.7 million profit the prior year which the firm said was driven by one-off costs. On an underlying basis, earnings before tax, interest and other costs came in at £583.4 million for the period – 11% higher than last year. The company said it was now expecting higher sales growth for the year than its previous outlook, with online net gaming revenues forecast to rise by 7%.</p>

ATLANTA (AP) — Human rights scandals have marred World Cup tournaments for years, but FIFA is testing a new protocol requiring all host committees to develop action plans to protect human rights for the 2026 games in North America. With the games less than a year away, though, FIFA's commitment to upholding human rights is still under scrutiny. Human rights advocates who wanted more enforceable standards and clearer directions for local officials say FIFA watered down a more robust model for the plans. “Even though where we landed is very different than what we had consulted them on, the existence of the framework is in many ways unprecedented. Sports bodies have not had human rights frameworks that reflected the breadth of issues covered across so many jurisdictions. It's not self-executing,” said Jennifer Li, director of the O'Neill Institute's Center for Community Health Innovation at Georgetown Law and national coordinator of the Dignity 2026 Coalition, which is working with FIFA on human rights. Adding to advocates' unease, several U.S. host committees said they couldn't meet a March deadline for an early draft of their plans. A FIFA spokesperson said the governing body has been working closely with host cities and counties, which they say are on track to develop final action plans by the Aug. 29 deadline. Sixteen North American sites will host games, including 11 in the U.S. Human rights concerns in North America look different from those in other countries where FIFA has come under fire, which had few protections for workers and massive stadium and transportation construction projects. “The host communities are quite invested in their legacy, so they've stepped up,” said labor rights expert Deborah Greenfield, who is in an expert advisory group supporting FIFA's human rights work for 2026. U.S. President Donald Trump has ramped up immigration enforcement across the country, stirring fears that federal law enforcement officers will arrest workers and even travelers during the games. Trump imposed a travel ban on 12 countries in June, and seven face restrictions. A FIFA spokesperson said it is working with a White House task force to “bring millions of people from different nations and communities” together in the U.S. Protesters in Miami-Dade County gathered outside FIFA's offices in June to demand that the governing body protect travelers and workers and speak out against Trump's immigration moves. That came after a Club World Cup event hosted in the area by Spanish-language TV network Telemundo was canceled after an unexpected Coast Guard inspection involving at least one Border Patrol agent, local outlets reported. “There's no guarantee that you might not have ICE posted up at the World Cup,” South Florida AFL-CIO President Jeff Mitchell said. Local organizers don't seem to have their human rights plan ready and haven't agreed to meet with the union, Mitchell said. What tends to happen is everybody gets their bag and then they turn a blind eye to making sure people are getting paid properly or not being harassed.” More than 9,000 unhoused people were arrested when Atlanta prepared to host the Olympics in 1996, and a plan to eliminate homelessness downtown before the World Cup worries advocates that unhoused people will be jailed again. Atlanta officials and partners say the Downtown Rising plan is a part of the mayor's larger investments in reducing homelessness and building affordable housing. The goal is to house people, not put them in jail, officials say. Cities with impending sporting events have ramped up enforcement, including San Jose, where unhoused people who reject three offers of shelter will now be eligible for arrest on trespassing charges. “This panic rush to disappear visible signs of poverty is very concerning,” said Dr. Mark Spencer, an Atlanta hospital physician involved in local advocacy. FIFA's human rights policy published in 2017 mandates bidders for the men's 2026 World Cup to respect “international human rights and labor standards according to the United Nations' guiding principles.” A group of international lawyers filed a formal complaint to FIFA in May claiming the soccer body is failing to uphold its human rights policy with 2034 World Cup host Saudi Arabia. In North America, Greenfield said FIFA is taking the goal of having a tournament “that respects and promotes human rights” seriously and she wouldn't be participating in the effort if she didn't think that was possible. Candace Stanciel, Atlanta's chief equity officer, said the city was committed to human rights work before FIFA came in and launched efforts to combat human trafficking in airports, hotels and public transport. Officials are working on potential language tools, accessibility measures for people with disabilities and an app to report issues including human rights abuses. The International Labour Organization called FIFA's human rights framework “an important step forward in harnessing the power of sport to advance decent work globally,” adding that it aligns with international labor standards.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By keeping up with some of the world's top sides in what will be an action-packed European club season. In other countries, domestic league action is already underway. So what if the defending European champions lost decisively to Chelsea in last month's FIFA Club World Cup final? Luis Enrique's PSG is still the team to beat in 2025-26. Luis Enrique returns close to his entire squad from last season's long-awaited triumph, though keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma could leave this month. If he does, the Parisians already have Donnarumma's replacement in French international Lucas Chevalier, who arrived from Lille for $47 million. Despite the tragic death of forward Diogo Jota, Liverpool has only gotten better this summer. Arne Slot's side has been the big winner of this transfer window, dropping north of $350 million on backup keeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, defenders Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, and forwards Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz. Baca was just seconds away from reaching the UEFA Champions League final last season under first-year manager Hansi Flick. This season, the Blaugrana are looking to go at least one step further. Robert Lewandowski, who turns 37 on Aug. 21, remains an elite striker. Chelsea already have an emerging superstar in winger Cole Palmer — this season he'll be supported by new recruits like strikers Liam Delap and João Pedro, Pedro's fellow Brazilian attacker Estêvão, and English forward Jamie Gittens. The Premier League runner-up in each of the last three seasons, what Mikel Arteta's team is missing at this point are trophies. The Gunners knocked then-Champions League holders Real Madrid out of Europe's top club tournament last April, snaring a convincing 5-1 aggregate win. The record 15-time European champs are coming off what, by their standards, was a dreadful 2024-25, with no major titles secured. But Los Blancos still boast one of the deepest, most expensive squads on Planet Fútbol. And Kylian Mbappé & Co. are now led by one of the sport's great up-and-coming coaches in former Real Madrid captain Xabi Alonso, who replaced the legendary Carlo Ancelotti in June. City's unprecedented run of four consecutive Premier League titles came to a halt last season, when Pep Guardiola's side finished third, lost the FA Cup final to Crystal Palace, and were eliminated from European play before the Champions League's round of 16 even began. This team is too good not to bounce back in a big way this year, though — even without club legend Kevin de Bruyne, whose contract wasn't extended. Inter added Croatian midfielder Petar Sučić, Brazilian winger Luis Henrique and French striker Ange-Yoan Bonny this summer. Besides veteran forward Joaquín Correa, their most significant departure is manager Simone Inzaghi, who was replaced by former Inter defender Cristian Chivu in June. Things will be different this year without club legend (and new Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder) Thomas Müller, with Leroy Sané leaving, too. But the $81 million arrival of Colombian winger Luis Díaz from Liverpool will help. Occasionally, Madrid's other team outlasts Spain's double-headed monster. Longtime manager Diego Simeone will be hoping his team is due after a strong summer transfer window which saw $185 million-worth of new talent arrive — including former Villarreal attacker Álex Baena, USMNT midfielder Johnny Cardoso and Argentine World Cup-winner (and Atlanta United alum) Thiago Almada. Scudetto winners in 2023 and 2025, the Neapolitans are no doubt aiming for similar success in European play this season to celebrate the club's centennial. The arrival of Champions League winner Kevin de Bruyne on a free transfer from Manchester City can't hurt. The Magpies eked into the Champions League places last term only because UEFA granted England's top flight one additional spot. Newcastle fans aren't complaining though, though they will be if and when star forward Alexander Isak leaves for Liverpool on the eve of the new season. David replaces Randal Kolo Muani, who returned to PSG upon the completion of his loan, in manager Igor Tudor's lineup. The club that helped develop the all-world likes of Jude Bellingham and Erling Haaland in recent years has a new batch coming through — one led by midfielder Jobe Bellingham, Jude's younger brother. It's hard to believe that the 20-time English champions finished 15th last season, when they also lost the Europa League final to Premier League rivals Tottenham. But the Red Devils added forwards Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Šeško this window, and they should fare better in Ruben Amorim's first full season at the Old Trafford helm. AS Monaco added a few more this summer in former France World Cup winner Paul Pogba and Barcelona loanee Ansu Fati. The loss of star attractions Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong (both to Liverpool) and manager Xabi Alonso (to Real Madrid) hurts. Same for Odilon Kossounou and Granit Xhaka, who also left this summer. They lost Tillman, Lang and others this summer, but having USMNT pair Sergiño Dest and Ricardo Pepi back healthy this season could be a coup for coach Peter Bosz. The Champions League-bound Turkish giants made waves this summer by signing prolific 26-year-old Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen from Napoli for $87 million on a permanent deal, as well as bringing in German winger Leroy Sané for free from Bayern Munich. The Ligue 1 runner-up to PSG last year and three times overall this decade, Marseille is chasing its first domestic title since 2010. The ambition is there, with L'OM dropping almost $90 million on transfers this summer. Yet two potentially huge contributors came for free: former Arsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and USMNT veteran Tim Weah, who previously won a French title with Lille in 2020-21.
