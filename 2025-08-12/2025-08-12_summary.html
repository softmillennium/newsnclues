Trump forwarded a false narrative around DC crime stats to justify the move. Plus, funeral held in Gaza for five journalists killed by Israeli attack

Good morning.

Donald Trump has ordered the national guard to Washington DC and seized control of the city's police force, describing a “lawless” city in ways that are sharply at odds with official crime statistics.

The president's move was swiftly condemned as a “disgusting, dangerous and derogatory” assault on the political independence of a racially diverse city. The federal takeover is expected to be in effect for 30 days, the White House confirmed to the Guardian.

Speaking at a White House press conference on Monday, Trump alleged DC was “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the world”, even though violent crime is at a 30-year low.

What do the crime figures tell us? That Trump is spreading a false narrative about DC crime – just as he did with LA. Violent crime in DC is at a 30-year low. In January, the Metropolitan police department and US attorney's office released a report indicating that total violent crime in DC in 2024 was down 35% from the previous year, marking the lowest rate in over 30 years.

How are Democrats responding? Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic minority leader in the House, described Trump as a “wannabe king” and said: “We stand with the residents of the District of Columbia and reject this unjustified power grab as illegitimate.”

The death of the prominent Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif, killed along with four colleagues in an Israeli airstrike on Sunday, prompted condemnation from around the world, as hundreds of mourners carried their bodies through the streets of Gaza City.

Sharif, one of Al Jazeera's most recognisable faces in Gaza, was killed while inside a tent for journalists outside al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on Sunday night. Seven people were killed in the attack, including the Al Jazeera correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and the camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa, according to the Qatar-based broadcaster.

How deadly has the war been for journalists? Before Sunday's airstrike, the Committee to Protect Journalists recorded at least 186 journalists and media workers killed in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel and Lebanon since the war began, making it the deadliest period for journalists since it began gathering data in 1992. The CPJ accuses Israel of directly targeting and killing 20 journalists and media workers. Any deliberate attack on a civilian could constitute a war crime, experts say. Israel, which has refused to let international media into Gaza, denies the accusation.

Donald Trump has announced he is nominating EJ Antoni, the chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, as the next commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The nomination comes after Trump fired the BLS commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, earlier this month following the release of a weak jobs report.

Trump, without evidence, alleged McEntarfer “faked” employment numbers in the run-up to the 2024 election to boost Kamala Harris's chances and said that the recent data was “rigged” to make Trump and Republicans look bad.

What happens next? The Senate will have to confirm Antoni's nomination to lead the BLS, an independent agency under the labor department. Experts fear Trump's interventions will undermine the credibility of the agency's economic data, long seen as a gold standard.

Donald Trump said he and Vladimir Putin would discuss “land swapping” when they meet on Friday in Alaska for a summit on the Ukraine war, and expressed frustration with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Meanwhile, Trump again delayed implementing sweeping tariffs on China, announcing another 90-day pause hours before the last agreement expired.

An explosion at a US Steel plant in Pennsylvania killed two people and injured at least 10 on Monday. “It felt like thunder,” said one worker near the scene.

Spain's central government has ordered officials in a Spanish town to scrap a ban on religious gatherings in public sports centers, describing it as a “discriminatory” measure mainly affecting Muslims.

Villagers whose farms in Vietnam will be bulldozed to make way for a $1.5bn golf resort backed by the Trump family have reportedly been offered rice provisions and cash compensation of as little as $12 for a square meter of land by state authorities. Thousands of villagers will be offered compensation based on land size and location, according to a report by Reuters.

Anas al-Sharif, an Al Jazeera reporter, was killed by an Israeli airstrike on Sunday night. Before his killing, he prepared a message for his family, and calling for the world not to forget Gaza. “I have lived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification,” he writes.

Nurdles: they're buoyant, the size of a lentil and almost impossible to recover. Millions of these tiny plastic pellets are being washed up on the coast of Kerala in India in the latest in a series of global spills – with sea creatures thinking they're eggs – as plastic treaty talks continue in Geneva until Thursday.

Ventriloquism is back in vogue on stage and online. Its new hip practitioners explain why their vocal tricks and errant dummies are wowing audiences again. “It is very stripped back. That's why it feels fresh,” one ventriloquist says.

            Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed on Tuesday not to give eastern Ukrainian land to Russia, saying that abandoning the Donbas region would open the door for Russian President Vladimir Putin to “start a third war” in Ukraine.
    


            Zelensky's warning comes ahead of Putin's meeting with US President Donald Trump in Alaska on Friday, where the Russian president is expected to demand Ukrainian land as part of a peace deal.
    


            While there is confusion over Putin's reported conditions for a ceasefire, most versions stress that the Russian president will demand that Ukrainian forces withdraw from all parts of Ukraine's Donbas, which includes parts of the Donetsk region it still holds.
    


            “For the Russians, Donbas is a springboard for a future new offensive. If we leave Donbas of our own accord or under pressure, we will start a third war,” Zelensky said in a meeting with journalists. Russia illegally annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014, and went on to launch its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
    


            “I am not going to surrender my country because I have no right to do so,” he added. “If we leave Donbas today, our fortifications, our terrain, the heights we control, we will clearly open a bridgehead for the preparation of a Russian offensive.”

            Zelensky and Ukrainian military officials have warned that Russia is building up troops for a new offensive, ready to launch by September.
    


            “I haven't heard anything — not a single proposal that would guarantee that a new war won't start tomorrow and that Putin won't try to occupy at least Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv,” the Ukrainian president told reporters.
    


            “The exchange of territories is a very complex issue that cannot be separated from security guarantees for Ukraine, for our sovereign state and our people,” Zelensky added, noting that the European Union's involvement in peace talks is also crucial because “no one except Europe is giving us security guarantees.”
    


            A conversation between the US, Ukraine and “all of Europe” will take place on Wednesday, according to the Ukrainian president.
    


            Trump has signaled Zelensky would not participate in Friday's summit, though the US president previewed his plans to phone Kyiv immediately after the meeting, along with other European leaders, to brief them.

Trump said his goal is ultimately to get Putin and Zelensky in the same room to hash out their differences, and surmised only they would be able to find a way to end the war with some “land swapping” between them.
    


            “I'm not going to make a deal,” Trump said. “It's not up to me to make a deal. I think a deal should be made for both.”
    


            The White House on Tuesday characterized the upcoming meeting between Trump and Putin in Anchorage as a “listening exercise.”
    


            “Only one party that's involved in this war is going to be present, and so this is for the president to go and to get, again, a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.
    


            Asked by CNN's Kaitlan Collins whether the two presidents would meet one-on-one, Leavitt said that is “part of the plan.”
    


            Zelensky also gave further details on Tuesday about the diplomatic talks that have been taking place behind the scenes, as well as his take on the outcome of US special envoy Steve Witkoff's meeting with Putin.
    


            “Witkoff said that there should be territorial concessions on both sides. That's how it sounded. And that Putin probably wants us to leave Donbas. So it didn't sound like America wants us to leave,” Zelensky said. “I do not believe that Putin's proposal is Trump's proposal. I believe that Trump represents the United States of America. He acts as a mediator, he is in the middle – not on Russia's side.”

Contrary to President Trump's claims, eliminating cash bail has made Illinois safer, advocates say.

While announcing plans to send National Guard troops into the country's capital, the Trump administration spread falsehoods about crime in Washington, D.C., as well as legal system measures like Illinois's bail reform.

During his remarks at the White House, Trump claimed that “every place in the country where you have no cash bail is a disaster.” 

“Somebody murders somebody, and they're out on no cash bail before the day is out,” Trump said. “We're going to end that in Chicago.”

In 2021, the Illinois state legislature passed the Pretrial Fairness Act, which eliminated cash bail in the state and replaced it with individual assessments to determine a person's pre-trial conditions. This new system means that “people who pose a threat to their community will not be able to purchase their release,” Allie Preston, a senior policy analyst for the Center for American Progress, wrote in a report on the legislation. 

The overwhelming majority of people involved in the criminal legal system live in poverty, “[a]s a result many people are held in jail on bail amounts as low as $250 or $500,” she wrote.  

“People often must rely on family members and friends to supply bail money, thus spreading the economic impacts across families and communities,” she continued. “It is not uncommon for people to have to forgo paying for electricity, food, or rent to afford bail.” 

After Trump's remarks, the Illinois Network for Pretrial Justice, a coalition of organizations that championed the state's bail reform law, sent out a press release stating that “violent crime has actually significantly decreased since Illinois implemented the Pretrial Fairness Act.” 

“Thanks to Governor Pritzker and our state legislators, Illinois is now safer because money is no longer the primary factor determining who returns to the community and who is jailed while awaiting trial,” the group said. 

Despite Department of Justice data that shows crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low, Trump and members of his administration claimed that crime was rampant in the city, particularly offenses committed by children.

“Our secret weapon here in D.C. is [U.S.] Attorney [for the District of Columbia] Jeanine Pirro, one of the toughest prosecutors and a former judge,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters. “She is going to be talking about juvenile crime, how it's out of control here.” 

Pirro said she sees “too much violent crime being committed by young punks,” and called for harsher punishments for children, contrary to research that shows incarceration causes catastrophic harm to kids and does not make communities safer.

“[O]verwhelming evidence [shows] that incarceration is an ineffective strategy for steering youth away from delinquent behavior and that high rates of youth incarceration do not improve public safety,” according to a report from The Sentencing Project. “Incarceration harms young people's physical and mental health, impedes their educational and career success, and often exposes them to abuse.” 

In order to justify its calls to gut reforms that keep kids out of the adult legal system, the Trump administration misrepresented the prevalence of crime committed by children in the nation's capital. 

In an email to subscribers, Fwd.us, a criminal justice reform group, said: “With the White House announcing the extraordinary step of deploying the National Guard to D.C. to ‘address street crime' despite crime rates being at historic lows, some of the loudest talking points about youth crime are about to dominate headlines again.”

“Here's what the evidence says,” the group continued. “Youth crime is at a historical low. Fewer young people were arrested last summer than in any of the last forty non-pandemic years, and given the declines in crime seen this year, that will probably go down again in 2025.”

Eduardo Ferrer, a law professor at Georgetown University and policy director of the Juvenile Justice Initiative, told Courthouse News that, “youth arrests are well below where they were pre-pandemic.”

“If the federal government wants to help our capital community thrive, it should restore Medicaid cuts, allow D.C. to spend the tax revenue it raised and make us the 51st state,” he said.

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            Artificial intelligence search company Perplexity has made an unsolicited, $34.5 billion offer to purchase Google's Chrome browser, a surprise move by a Google Search challenger that's looking to upend how people find information online.
    


            Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer confirmed to CNN the details of the offer, which The Wall Street Journal first reported.
    


            The bid comes as Google awaits a court's decision after a landmark ruling last year found that the internet giant had violated US antitrust law with its search business. The US Justice Department has proposed as a remedy that Google sell its Chrome browser.
    


            Google has promised to appeal the ruling and called the idea of spinning off Chrome an “unprecedented proposal” that it says would harm consumers and security. Google declined to provide a comment to CNN regarding Perplexity's bid.
    


            Perplexity's offer — while likely a long shot, given Google's resistance to a forced sale of Chrome — marks the latest example of how new firms are taking on tech's biggest players to reshape the internet in the AI era.
    


            Perplexity is a nearly three-year-old startup whose search tool uses AI models to parse web content and curate answers. Answers are usually posted as a summary, although Perplexity does provide links to its sources. It launched an AI search engine that competes with Google's dominant offering in December 2022.
    


AI search firm Perplexity makes $34.5 billion surprise bid for Google Chrome



            Perplexity launched its own AI-powered web browser called Comet in July. The company is pitching it as a more personalized browser that connects the dots between a user's calendars, browsing tabs, social channels and more. OpenAI is also said to be developing a web browser, according to Reuters, in yet another signal that AI companies are looking to play a bigger role in how people use the web.
    


            Perplexity said it would maintain users' current browsing preferences, including Google as the default search engine, if it were to buy Chrome, Dwyer told CNN.
    


            It would also commit to “continued available and support” for Chrome for 100 months and investing $3 billion in Chromium over the next 24 months, according to Dwyer. Chromium is Google's open-source underlying technology that other tech companies – including Microsoft and Perplexity – can use to build their own browsers.
    


            Perplexity made the offer because it “believes in the open web,” Dwyer said.
    


            Perplexity was most recently valued at $18 billion following a $100 million funding round, Bloomberg said in a report last month, citing a person familiar with the matter. The company did not comment on the report.
    


            That makes Perplexity's offer for Chrome worth nearly double its own valuation. Google, meanwhile, is worth nearly $2.5 trillion; shares of the company (GOOGL) rose around 1% on Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal reported that several investors have agreed to back the purchase, including large venture capital firms.
    


            “This is a smart and opportunistic move by Perplexity given the case against Google and regulatory scrutiny,” Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told CNN, adding that he estimates Chrome is worth at least $50 billion. “This is all a game of high stakes poker and Perplexity made a good move.”
    


            Google Chrome isn't the only high profile acquisition target that Perplexity has pursued. The company said earlier this year it was making a bid to buy TikTok, after a law was passed last year requiring the social media app's parent company, ByteDance, to sell it to a non-China-based company or face a ban in the United States.
    


            Perplexity has also reportedly been eyeballed by bigger tech players — both Meta and Apple have had discussions about buying the AI search firm, according to reports from Bloomberg and The Information, although it's not clear the talks will go anywhere.

			Proposal for 600 National Guard troops stationed across Alabama and Arizona bases to be deployed at short notice

The Trump administration is reportedly weighing plans to establish a “domestic civil disturbance” force of hundreds of National Guard troops to deal with protests and unrest.

Internal Pentagon documents reportedly outline a proposal for 600 troops stationed across military bases in Alabama and Arizona, ready to go at a moment's notice.

The plan, seen by The Washington Post, suggests a rotation model using troops from units in multiple states, with personnel equipped with weapons and riot gear, and deployments lasting 90 days to “limit burnout”.

The first 100 servicemen would be ready to be deployed within one hour, according to the plans, with the second and third waves mobilised within two and 12 hours.

If military aircraft and aircrews were needed on standby, the plans could cost hundreds of millions of dollars, according to documents seen by the Post.

The proposal suggests Donald Trump plans to continue using US forces domestically.

It comes after the US president made the extraordinary move to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington DC to tackle crime in the capital.

National Guard soldiers were seen arriving in the city on Tuesday morning. Pictures showed troops, dressed in camouflage, reporting for duty in the capital.

As well as deploying 800 National Guard troops to Washington, Mr Trump said he would bring the city's police department under federal control, becoming the first president in history to do so.

Critics questioned Mr Trump's true intentions with the move, pointing to police data showing violent crimes in Washington had been in decline since 2023.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Kamala Harris's former running mate, said of the move: “The road to authoritarianism is littered with people telling you you're overreacting.”

Meanwhile, rumoured Democrat 2028 hopeful, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker warned Mr Trump that he has “absolutely no right and no legal ability” to send troops to Chicago, adding: “I have talked about the fact that the Nazis in Germany in the '30s tore down a constitutional republic in just 53 days.

“It does not take much, frankly, and we have a president who seems hell-bent on doing just that.”

Muriel Bowser, the city's mayor, called the move “unsettling and unprecedented,” although she conceded that more policing in high-crime neighbourhoods could be a good thing.

Hours after Mr Trump made the announcement, a man was shot dead close to the scene of two attacks raised by the US president during his announcement on Monday.

The suspected homicide happened within half a mile of where a congressional intern was killed by a stray bullet last month and where a former government official was killed in his car last year during a failed carjacking attempt.

The numbers floated in the Pentagon proposal amount to a fraction of the 5,000 National Guard troops and Marines Mr Trump deployed to Los Angeles after anti-ICE protests erupted across the city earlier this year.

A similar idea to the proposed “domestic civil disturbance quick reaction force” was floated following Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, with around 600 troops put on notice in Arizona and Alabama.

It is not clear whether the Pentagon proposal has been reviewed by Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary.

The documents were compiled by National Guard officials, with at least one action memo prepared by Elbridge Colby, a national security policy chief, which recommends the forces should receive extra training for this mission.

Mr Colby is said to have frustrated Mr Trump earlier this year when he reportedly froze military aid to Ukraine because US stockpiles were low. The move was rapidly reversed by Mr Trump amid criticism of government incohesion.

The proposal suggests the earliest the rapid response taskforce could be funded through the Pentagon is 2027.

Concerns highlighted in the proposal include the depleted availability of troops for local emergencies, such as wildfires and hurricanes, as well as questions over the appropriate use of the force.

The Telegraph has contacted the DoD for comment.

The leaders must now translate positive experiences from the Pan-American Congress into action in their home countries.

On the final day of the Second Pan-American Congress this month, more than 60 delegates from 12 countries made their way into the Secretary of Public Education headquarters in downtown Mexico City. As leaders from the Americas walked through the building's passages and patios, many stopped to take pictures in front of the walls lined with murals from famous artists, including Diego Rivera.

The UNESCO World Heritage Site served as the location of the final plenary of the three-day gathering aimed at uniting progressive and democratic forces in the Western hemisphere to take on rising far right authoritarianism.

Delegates representing communities from as far as Nunavut in Canada to the extreme southern tip of South America eventually took their seats in the Ibero-American Hall, a space adorned with a massive, nearly 1,500-square-foot mural, appropriately called “The Union of Latin America” by Roberto Montenegro.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

From this hall, the message from Mexico was unambiguous: The peoples and the elected representatives of this hemisphere are ready to act to confront the global threat of fascism.

“We are of course facing an authoritarian threat in the world: it is the return of fascist positions to power,” María José Pizarro, a Colombian senator from the ruling Pacto Historico coalition, told Truthout. “In the face of this, we must therefore build joint strategies that allow us to confront it in the best possible way in countries where this is already happening, and in those where it is not, to prevent the return of this type of government.” 

When it comes to hemispheric relations, U.S. President Donald Trump has pursued what has been described as a “divide and conquer” strategy, leveraging the national interests of one country against another and pitting neighbors against each other in order to squeeze out concessions from leaders. Trump has been able to follow this strategy to varying degrees of success, in part due to the lack of unity regarding the threat he represents to the entire world.

“[Fascism] is not a regional threat, it's not a threat to one country, it's a threat that's growing worldwide,” said Pizarro.

From the Atlas Network, a coalition of right-wing think tanks and advocacy groups that promote neoliberal policies globally, to Trump's open and blatant interference inside Brazil in order to back his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, in the face of charges over his effort to carry out a coup after losing the 2022 election, the far right has been successful in building trans-national links.

One aim of the Pan-American Congress is to break down barriers between progressives and anti-fascists who have historically lacked an institutional space to better coordinate their own regional response.

One standout feature of this gathering was the participation of elected representatives from the United States, including Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota), Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Illinois), Delia Ramírez (D-Illinois), and Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan); Canadian Members of Parliament (MPs), such as interim New Democratic Party leader Don Davies, Leah Gazan, and Lori Idlout; and MPs from the governing Liberals, such as Michael Coteau, also attended.

Pizarro, who is also a potential candidate for Colombia's 2026 presidential election, described the participation of U.S. and Canadian lawmakers at the Pan-American Congress as “fundamental” and expressed optimism that this would be the beginning of a closer relationship with progressives in North America.

“We don't see ourselves as isolated from North America, but rather the opposite, as part of an American continent that integrates us all,” said Pizarro. “We rarely have the opportunity to listen to each other, to talk, especially today when the United States government is speaking out strongly about its position on Latin America, its relationship with Latin America, and that conversation with progressive Democratic congressmembers, of course, must be strengthened,” she added.

The enthusiasm for building closer ties goes both ways. 

U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib said she drew inspiration from her conversations with other lawmakers fighting for their communities and the power of connecting with fellow activists across the Americas. 

“We don't see ourselves as isolated from North America, but rather the opposite, as part of an American continent that integrates us all.”

Tlaib drew parallels from her experience growing up in Detroit, Michigan, in a neighborhood impacted by corporate pollution with the stories she heard from colleagues at the congress from Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico.

“These corporations don't care about these borders. They come and extract, make us sick, and just leave us with nothing,” said Tlaib.

But now she says she feels “less alone in this fight against corporate greed, against corporate polluters, against those that don't care about our communities thriving.”

Tlaib cited her conversations with Canadian MPs about the need to collaborate in the fight against the environmental threat posed by the Line 5 pipeline that threatens water systems in both the U.S. and Canada. 

“We are now building these bridges and creating a movement that brings all of us together and understanding that connectivity,” Tlaib told Truthout.

Tlaib, the first Palestinian woman to serve in U.S. Congress and an important voice on the global stage speaking out against Israel's ongoing genocide of Palestinians, also expressed gratitude at the centering of the Palestinian people's cause at the gathering. At every event over the course of the weekend, speakers spoke up in support of Palestine in no uncertain terms, firmly expressing their solidarity.

“It's very rare that you see that in the United States Congress, but we saw it at the Pan-American Congress,” said Tlaib.

Coming on the heels of July's Emergency Conference on Palestine, which likewise saw world leaders gather to take action in an attempt to halt the genocide, delegates at the congress said recognizing the state of Palestine was only a starting point. 

“In our view, much deeper actions, much more forceful voices — and of course, the role being played by multilateral organizations, which have been stripped of their value and the ability to defend life in the face of the genocide being perpetrated against the Palestinian people — are essential,” said Pizarro.

Meanwhile, Colombian Deputy Minister of Multilateral Affairs Mauricio Jaramillo Jassir argued that countries with progressive governments have no choice but to break diplomatic relations with Israel.

In addition to calling for an end to the genocide against the Palestinian people, participants in the conference discussed Trump's human rights violations against migrants and refugees, and the need to confront climate change.

During his speech at the opening session, Mexican Senate President Gerardo Fernández Noroña said the two defining features of the rising fascist threat in the world were the suffering inflicted on Palestinians and the abuse of migrants by the U.S.

“It is an unjust, vile, incorrect persecution where, by virtue of being a migrant, or the color of your skin or your nationality, people are persecuted,” said Noroña.

The mistreatment of migrants is the clearest case study on the necessity of confronting fascism in the Americas. Trump has leaned on allies like El Salvador's far right President Nayib Bukele, who infamously agreed to detain more than 230 Venezuelan migrants sent from the U.S. in his notorious mega-prison before negotiations between Caracas and Washington eventually secured their release. 

Mexico in particular has faced enormous pressure from both U.S. political parties to crack down on migrants transiting through its territory as they try to reach the United States. More recently, the Mexican government has had to face down repeated tariff threats from Trump over the issue of migration. 

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has explicitly declined to become a third-country destination for non-Mexican asylum seekers and has resisted U.S. efforts to impose such arrangements. As a result, the Trump administration has secured agreements with Guatemala and Honduras instead, arrangements that ultimately serve to undermine efforts by any one country in the region to resist the U.S.'s mass deportation agenda.

The selection of Mexico City as the host of the Second Pan-American Congress (the first having been held last year in Bogotá, Colombia) offered delegates the opportunity to learn from the political project known locally as the “Fourth Transformation,” the leftist national political project to shift Mexico to a post-neoliberal model that began with the election of Andrés Manuel López Obrador in 2018 and continued under President Sheinbaum.

With the election of Sheinbaum in 2024, Mexico proved to be one of the few countries that bucked a trend in which voters ousted incumbents and replaced them, in many cases, with right-wing populists, such as Javier Milei in Argentina.

Sheinbaum, who has been lauded for repeatedly standing up to Trump, welcomed delegates at the National Palace, allowing representatives from throughout the hemisphere to share their experiences resisting the U.S. president — and also to share firsthand how Mexico has been able to not only navigate an intemperate neighbor, but also continue to press forward with its anti-neoliberal political agenda. 

“These corporations don't care about these borders. They come and extract, make us sick, and just leave us with nothing.”

Canadian MP Leah Gazan, a member of the Wood Mountain Lakota Nation who represents Winnipeg in Canada's House of Commons, said her time in Mexico left her feeling renewed and hopeful.

“What's happened in Mexico is so inspiring … and to see women, progressive women, strong women, leading the narrative about the importance of humanizing politics, the importance of rooting democracy and human rights, is a refreshing change from what we're witnessing in Canada right now,” Gazan told Truthout.

“I think we have a lot of lessons to learn from the Global South,” said Gazan.

The challenge facing elected representatives now is translating the positive experiences from the congress in Mexico into action in their home countries.

During a Pan-American Congress event at the Esperanza Iris Theatre in Mexico City, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar renewed her pledge to fight for marginalized communities throughout the hemisphere from her place inside the U.S. Congress, signaling to the peoples of the Global South that they have an ally in her.

“Since being in the elected office, I've made an effort to set myself apart as somebody who sees the global community as one, someone who understands our destinies and our fates are intertwined, someone who understands that being in the United States provides us with great privileges but also with responsibilities,” Omar told Truthout.

Omar has repeatedly expressed her solidarity with the Global South, especially Latin America, by participating in an on-the-ground delegation to Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in 2022, and through numerous legislative initiatives focusing on migration and human rights.

The U.S. representative also shared her view that progressives in the U.S., especially those in elected office, have an elevated duty to end U.S. policies that harm people throughout the world, saying, “It is our policies that are actively responsible for sanctions, for militarization, for exploitation, and it is up to us to make sure that we are lifting our voices collectively to say, ‘No, there is another way.'” 

Trump's aggressive approach to relations with his neighbors in the region may have caught many somewhat off guard, but more than six months into his second term, leaders from this hemisphere have now adapted and are forming new united strategies to take on Trump.

At the close of the 2025 Pan-American Congress, delegates reported the discussions and proposals from the various working groups. From efforts to advance an explicit recognition of systemic racism throughout the Americas, to calls for a new global order based on human dignity and solidarity among nations, there was widespread consensus on the need for stronger international cooperation to confront the global rise of fascism, denouncing its role in migrant persecution in the U.S., and the genocide in Gaza.

With the next Pan-American Congress set to take place in Uruguay next year, delegates such as Omar and Tlaib expressed a sense of hope and optimism that the gathering in Mexico City will serve as a turning point. 

“There is nothing like our sisters down south and what they deal with, but [they] continuously find joy in the work that they do on behalf of the communities they serve, and that is inspiring and I'll take that with me,” concluded Omar.

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            Spanish search and rescue teams have found the body of an American hiker who went missing in the Pyrenees last month.
    


            The body of Cole Henderson, 27, was located on the north face of Monte Perdido, the third-highest peak in the Pyrenees, Spain's Guardia Civil confirmed to CNN in an emailed statement on Tuesday.
    


            Authorities said the place where Henderson was found on Friday afternoon was a difficult area to access, with the specialist teams using a crane to airlift his body.
    


            On July 9, Henderson told friends he was going to hike into the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park in the province of Huesca. One of his last communications was a text to a friend saying he'd parked up and was putting his phone on airplane mode before starting his trek.
    


            He was reported missing and a search began on July 14 after failing to take his flight home to the Netherlands two days prior.
    


            Specialist mountain rescue teams and helicopters from the Air Service were deployed to assist in the search, the Guardia Civil previously told CNN.
    


            Authorities had been working on the theory that Henderson may have tried to climb Monte Perdido, which stands at 3,355 meters (11,007 feet) high.
    


            The route is rated as “Peu Difficile” (PD), meaning “somewhat difficult” by the climbing community. While PD routes are often climbed without ropes, they might involve steep sections of climbing, or crevassed glaciers, and frequently require specialized equipment, such as ice axes or crampons.
    


            The typical route from the town of Torla, where Henderson's car was located, was still covered in snow in early July, according to footage posted on social media.

The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec earned a 4.6-per-cent return in the first half of the year, beating its 4.3-per-cent benchmark as the pension fund's chief executive officer warned the full economic impact of U.S. tariffs is not yet clear.

Total assets increased $23-billion to $496-billion in the six months to June 30, and the fund also surpassed its benchmarks for five- and 10-year returns. Over the last decade, the Caisse has earned an average annual return of 7 per cent. 

Publicly-traded equities led the way with a 6-per-cent return, bolstered by a 4.5-per-cent gain from infrastructure investments. Real estate lagged, increasing by 0.1 per cent and falling short of a 1.2-per-cent benchmark, and private equity recorded a modest 3.4-per-cent increase. 

A debate is raging over Canadian pension plans' domestic investments — and Caisse's CEO is at the centre of it all

Caisse CEO Charles Emond cautioned that tariff issues stemming from U.S. policy were a “major concern” in the first half of the year as markets plunged in April before bouncing back, and could still be cause for concern in the coming months.

“Despite this overall performance, we must remain vigilant as we have yet to see the full effects of the U.S. administration's measures,” Mr. Emond said in a statement. 

One scenario on the Caisse's radar is the possibility that tariff measures could slow the U.S. economy and raise prices, driving up inflation and causing central banks to respond by holding interest rates higher. 

“The rest of the year will be interesting,” Mr. Emond said at a Tuesday press conference with reporters. “The full impact of inflation has not been felt.”

A rapid depreciation of the U.S. dollar put a dent in the Caisse's returns, as though a hedging strategy offset nearly half of the potential losses.

 A large-scale military invasion of Gaza City would force more than 900,000 people to flee.

The Israeli security cabinet approved a plan presented by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on August 8 to fully occupy the Gaza Strip and forcibly displace the residents of Gaza City from the north of the territory to the south. 

The news of the plan spread rapidly among those of us in Gaza, leaving us in a state of shock and despair. We had been following the updates in hopes of hearing about a possible ceasefire — not a full occupation and a new wave of displacement. Since the Israeli plan was announced, the Israeli army has intensified its artillery bombardment and airstrikes on the southern part of Gaza City.

The decision comes at a time when starvation has severely gripped the Gaza Strip. According to UN officials, since late May, nearly 1,400 people struggling to obtain basic food supplies have been killed through Israel's failed food distribution. In addition, more than 500,000 people in Gaza are facing starvation, and all 320,000 children under the age of 5 are at risk of severe malnutrition. 

The Israeli plan was met with condemnation from both Western and Arab countries, who warned that it would further diminish the chances of achieving a permanent ceasefire and bring nothing but more destruction and suffering. Nevertheless, Netanyahu insisted that he would press ahead with his plan, refusing to yield to rhetorical pressure from other nations.

Some reports, citing statements from Israeli officials, indicated that the plan will be implemented in phases. The first phase involves the occupation of Gaza City by displacing its roughly 1 million residents to areas Israel designates as “safe zones,” while providing what Netanyahu's office describes as humanitarian aid to civilians outside the combat zones. Israel has bombed safe zones it has designated itself repeatedly over the course of its assault on Gaza; meanwhile, the current aid scheme run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has been described by the UN as a “death trap.”

The mass forcible displacement will reportedly be followed by intensified airstrikes aimed at clearing the way for troops to encircle the city and conduct incursions into residential neighborhoods. Netanyahu has said that the military will also focus on occupying the refugee camps in the central Strip.

In Gaza City, most people view this plan as a continuation of Israel's systematic strategy to replicate the devastation seen in Gaza's northern governorate, Rafah, and Khan Younis — targeting the few remaining areas in the Strip that still have residential buildings and landmarks. This could pave the way for Israeli right-wing extremists to bring back settlements in Gaza and confine the Palestinian population to a specific area in the south, in preparation for their forced displacement outside the Strip.

During the 22-month war, most of Gaza City's neighborhoods — now marked as the first target in Israel's latest plan — have endured bloody massacres, relentless bombardment, suffocating starvation, and temporary military incursions. However, they have so far been spared the total destruction that devastated Rafah and other parts of the Strip, as the most intense fighting and incursions have, until now, been concentrated in the city's eastern areas, including Al-Tufah, Al-Shujaiya, and Al-Zaytun. 

Now, Gaza City — especially its central and western areas, which were already overcrowded with residents — has become even more congested, as thousands of evacuees have poured in from the eastern part of the city and from the northern governorate, including Beit Hanoun, Jabalia, and Beit Lahia. This influx followed the Israeli military operation called Gideon's Chariots by Israel, and known as “Markeb Jadoun” on the ground in Gaza, which launched in May. By that operation's end, Israel had seized large parts of the northern Strip and confined its population to specific areas within Gaza City.

Most people in Gaza City, including both evacuees and original residents who lost their homes, are now living in flimsy tents that lack basic necessities, crammed into makeshift camps set up in any available spaces — playgrounds, parks, and even along Gaza City's beach. Others have taken shelter in schools and public institutions that have been converted into housing for displaced families, where conditions are equally harsh; in some cases, a single classroom accommodates three or four families.

The overcrowded conditions in Gaza City mean that any large-scale military invasion would trigger a humanitarian catastrophe, forcing more than 900,000 people to flee under the looming threat of massacres and a bloody invasion. They would be pushed toward the south, where evacuation orders have already covered most areas and Israeli forces have seized two of the area's largest cities — Rafah and Khan Younis.

Ahmed Totah, 56, said that during the ceasefire in January 2025, he and his family managed to return to their home in the Jabalia refugee camp after 16 months of displacement in the south. However, Totah was only able to live in his home for two months before the Israeli military resumed the war and expanded their operations in the north, reaching his neighborhood.Refusing to move back south, Totah decided to flee to the western part of Gaza City, to an area called Al-Rimal, where he set up his tent in a public park called Al-Jundi.

“Isn't the hell we are already living through enough?” Totah said. “Now Israel wants to displace us once again to the south. We have no food or clean water, and we live in flimsy tents that offer no protection from the scorching sun or the cold of winter. On top of that, the daily bombardments terrorize us. We are exhausted and have no energy left to face the suffering of yet another displacement. We have literally reached a point where we prefer death over living this life.”

Rawan Husain Ali, 22, said she has been displaced in the heart of Gaza City since the early days of the war, after her neighborhood, Al-Shujaiya, was declared a dangerous war zone by the Israeli army. “The news of the Israeli occupation plan for Gaza City has brought back all the dark memories of destruction, killing, and displacement I endured in Al-Shujaiya,” she said. “My entire family is now consumed by worry, depression, and relentless thoughts about where we will live, where we will go, and how long our displacement will last. We have already lost our father and our home — we cannot bear to lose anything more or be displaced to the unknown. We can no longer endure such horrors.”

As hundred thousands of families in Gaza City, like those of Husain Ali and Totah, brace for yet another chapter of suffering that could end in their displacement from the Strip, Palestinians in Gaza ask an urgent question : Will the world move beyond mere words to take meaningful action that protects civilians, halt Israel's catastrophic plan, and save what remains of the devastated Strip before it is too late?

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

MOSCOW, August 12. /TASS/. European leaders will very quickly turn away from Vladimir Zelensky and try to improve relations with Russia, First Deputy Chairman of Russia's Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Vladimir Dzhabarov said on Thursday.

The senator noted that at the moment European leaders are trying to prove that they are "presenting a united front" with Zelensky but the situation may change. "I think they will very quickly turn away from Zelensky when the time comes, and will just as quickly try to run even ahead of [U.S. President Donald] Trump in an attempt to establish some sort of relations with us," he told the Rossiya-24 TV channel.

Dzhabarov also commented on the upcoming meeting between Russian and US Presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump on August 15, suggesting that, in addition to the Ukrainian issue, the two heads of state will discuss economic matters and the restoration of diplomatic relations. "Obviously, this will not happen in a single meeting – it will take time, and most importantly, patience from both sides," he added.

Dzhabarov stressed that bargaining over the lawful territories of the Russian Federation will be out of place when it comes to resolving the Ukrainian conflict. "I mean all four new regions, as well as Crimea, which has long been part of Russia. These are our constitutional lands, our constitutional territories, and no one will bargain over this issue with the Americans, let alone the Ukrainians," the senator concluded.

Trump said on August 8 that he hopes to hold a meeting with Putin in Alaska on August 15. This was later confirmed by Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov, who said that the two leaders will focus on discussing options for reaching a lasting settlement of the Ukrainian crisis.

Fake heiress denies responsibility as social media users accuse her of mistreating the three bunnies

After years of prison and conniving her way into luxury, Anna Sorokin has New York talking about her again.

This time, it is not posing as a German heiress or being jailed for four years, instead the convicted fraudster has been left “disturbed” and “horrified” after three rabbits used in her photoshoot were found dumped in a nearby park.

Sorokin, who also went by the name Anna Delvey and is the subject of Netflix's Inventing Anna, shot to infamy after a high-profile court case. The fraudster, who masqueraded as an heiress, swindled the wealthy in Manhattan with an invented trust fund.

But this latest saga involves a photograph on her Instagram account, in which she is pictured outside a Tribeca subway station with a black ankle monitor – stipulated under the terms of her 2022 prison release – and holding two leashed rabbits.

Days after posing for the photographs, social media users were quick to link the abandoned bunnies with Sorokin after the animals were spotted in Prospect Park in Brooklyn.

“I felt ashamed and embarrassed to be associated with it,” Sorokin said of the affair. The 34-year-old said she was not responsible for the rabbits and was “horrified” to learn they had been dumped.

The first bunny, a one-and-a-half-year-old Harlequin lop, was found in the bushes by Terry Chao near a cardboard box used as part of Sorokin's photoshoot last week. On Thursday, another rabbit was found near the same cardboard box, followed by a third on Sunday, near a black carrier bag, she told the New York Times.

The man who photographed Sorokin, Jasper Egan Soloff, told the newspaper through a lawyer that it was not his shoot and claimed to have no knowledge of how the animals were obtained or handled.

Another person involved in the shoot appears to have apologised and taken responsibility in a since-deleted Instagram post.

“When I realised the rabbits were being surrendered to me I panicked. At 19, with no experience caring for animals, no pet-friendly housing, and no knowledge of available resources, I felt overwhelmed and made the worst possible choice,” he reportedly wrote.

“Believing, mistakenly, that there were existing rabbits in that area, I released them there, thinking that was my best option.”

He added that they were being fostered by someone in New York, while Sorokin said she offered to help rehome the rabbits when she learned they had been abandoned.

People on social media have accused Sorokin of animal cruelty. Many commenters decried her use of the animals as props, and warned against photographing bunnies on leashes on their backs, a position known as trancing that can be harmful to the animals.

“I do not eat meat, and I had no involvement in the acquisition, transport, or return of these animals. I would never condone these actions,” Sorokin told the website Page Six. After being convicted in 2019 on multiple counts of larceny and theft, she was released after nearly four years in jail and a further 18 months in immigration detention for overstaying her visa, and was told to refrain from posting on social media.

Stand Up Alaska NGO plans to hold a protest ahead of the upcoming meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the northwestern U.S. state, according to an Aug. 11 statement.

As Washington seeks a path to end the war in Ukraine, the upcoming Aug. 15 meeting between Trump and Putin will mark their first face-to-face talks since the start of Trump's second term.

"We're here to tell Trump and Putin: Alaska opposes tyranny!" Stand Up Alaska's statement read.

The rally, scheduled for Aug. 14 in Anchorage, Alaska's largest city, is being held to protest the "presence of an international war criminal" and as a show of solidarity with Ukraine, the NGO said.

Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy previously said the state was prepared to host the upcoming meeting between Trump and Putin, calling the event "historic."

"Alaska is the most strategic location in the world, sitting at the crossroads of North America and Asia, with the Arctic to our north and the Pacific to our south," Dunvealy wrote on X on Aug. 9.

"With a mere two miles separating Russia from Alaska, no other place plays a more vital role in our national defense, energy security, and Arctic leadership," he added.

Trump announced the summit with Putin on Aug. 8 and reportedly told Ukraine and European leaders that the Kremlin is open to negotiations if "land swaps" are part of the deal.

Though it remains unclear what such a deal would entail, a source in Ukraine's Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent that Moscow seeks Kyiv's full withdrawal from partially occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in the east while offering to withdraw its forces from the limited areas it holds in the northeastern Sumy and Kharkiv oblasts.

Publicly, Putin has demanded a ban on Ukraine's NATO membership and a full Ukrainian withdrawal from partially occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts as a precondition for peace talks.

In turn, Zelensky has rejected formally ceding territory to Russia and urged a ceasefire as the first step toward peace talks, a position backed by Kyiv's European partners.

Zelensky is also expected to hold talks with European leaders and Trump two days before the summit in Alaska, on Aug. 13.

The technology provides connectivity when traditional cellular networks are unavailable, particularly during power outages from Russian strikes on critical infrastructure.

The General Staff said more than 110,000 Russian troops are concentrated in the Pokrovsk area and are attempting to penetrate defenses by sending small infantry units between Ukrainian lines.

Russian forces advanced toward the Dobropillia–Kramatorsk highway in Donetsk Oblast, seizing positions in nearby settlements to support further offensive operations.

The strike targeted a logistics hub in the village of Kizil-Yul, roughly 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from Ukraine, igniting a fire at the site. 



The proposal aims to address concerns over the country's declining student population and the growing risk of losing young talent abroad.

The move comes as gasoline prices in Russia have jumped nearly 50% since the start of the year, with Ai-95 setting record highs for five consecutive days. 



The Polish police detained more than 100 people over the weekend following an Aug. 9 concert of Belarusian rapper Max Korzh at Warsaw's National Stadium.



The statement comes as the Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState reported that Russian forces made a push toward the Dobropillia–Kramatorsk highway in Donetsk Oblast.

"The only sensible action for EU leaders is to initiate an EU-Russia summit, based on the example of the U.S.-Russia meeting," Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.

The rally, scheduled for Aug. 14 in Anchorage, is being held to protest the "presence of an international war criminal" and as a show of solidarity with Ukraine, Stand Up Alaska said.



The Financial Times identified 7 million square meters of new industrial development after tracking changes at 150 facilities across 37 companies, namely those associated with ammunition and missile production.

MOSCOW, August 12. /TASS/. Europe's leaders are painting a picture of a Russian "enemy" to offload responsibility for the severe socio-economic crisis facing their countries, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Expert magazine in an interview.

"To justify aggression and divert societal frustration against Russia, a complex campaign of defamation has been launched - fueled by constant provocations, falsehoods, and outright lies. In the midst of a profound socio-economic crisis, today's European leaders are seemingly in desperate need of an ‘enemy' to blame for their failures and troubles," she explained.

Zakharova further asserted that Euro-Atlantic capitals remain committed to achieving a "strategic defeat" of Russia, willing to go to any lengths to realize this objective. "The West has fostered and supported the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev, fixated on eradicating everything Russian. Despite failed blitzkrieg strategies, sanctions, and efforts to arm Kiev's regime, these measures have not shifted the realities on the frontlines," she said.

She also highlighted ongoing efforts to implant an "anti-Russian, Russophobic worldview" globally. "It's important to recognize that these efforts are centuries old - from 19th-century newspapers and press to 20th-century anti-Soviet propaganda and Hollywood films, and now to the orchestrated campaigns and provocations of the modern era. Today, we are witnessing the peak of these Russophobic efforts," Zakharova concluded.

YOKOHAMA — Japanese table tennis ace Tomokazu Harimoto made a strategic choice to abandon one of his strongest techniques, and it paid off by adding an impressive title to his growing resume.

Harimoto defeated reigning world champion Wang Chuqin 4-2 in the men's final of the WTT Champions Yokohama tournament on Monday, avenging a whitewash loss to the Chinese star just a month ago.

The world No. 4-ranked Harimoto stormed out of the blocks to win the first three games, then rebounded after Wang took the next two to put away the match 11-9, 11-5, 11-8, 9-11, 11-13, 11-4 before a partisan crowd at Yokohama Buntai arena.

Harimoto went into the match with just two wins over Wang in 14 career meetings, including his straight sets loss last month in the United States. Needing an edge, Harimoto decided to not use the “chiquita,” a powerful backhand return with tremendous spin that curves like a banana.

“He's the one guy who can return it with twice as much power,” Harimoto said of the No. 2-ranked Wang.

The match went according to plan, leaving Wang struggling for answers as Harimoto used for less-aggressive style and settled for winning rallies.

“I can't believe it,” Harimoto repeatedly said after the match.

Earlier, Harimoto advanced to the final with a 4-1 victory over Kanak Jha of the United States.

In an all-Chinese women's final, Chen Xingtong defeated world champion Sun Yingsha 4-2.

When Russia first launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the conflict drew comparisons to wars of the twentieth century. Tanks, armored personnel carriers, and artillery dominated the battlefield, and both sides' infantry were dug into trenches. We witnessed this old-school style of war when we made our first visit to Ukraine in September 2022. Since then, we have made regular trips to Ukraine, affording us firsthand insight into a monumental transformation: the beginning of a new kind of warfare.

In summer 2023, the commander of Ukraine's Third Assault Brigade's Drone Unit, whom we'll call Fil (not his real name), told us that a new weapon had begun to change the conflict: first-person-view drones. These small, cheap, maneuverable quadcopters transmit real-time footage to their operators and detonate kamikaze-style on their targets. That year, Ukraine flooded the field with thousands of them and Russia soon followed suit. Today, hundreds of thousands of these drones fill the Ukrainian skies.

What began as a war with drones has become a war of drones. Indeed, two years ago, a Ukrainian brigade's strength was judged mostly by its inventory of Western-supplied tanks, armored personnel carriers, and artillery. Since 2023, however, drones have become the most important weapon on the battlefield. Because of their low cost, speed, and precision, drones have now largely supplanted traditional weaponry, including antitank missiles, mortars, tanks, and even artillery and aircraft. Today, a unit's power and resilience are dictated by its number of skilled drone operators and its ability to deploy drones at scale. (One of us, Schmidt, has been a longtime investor in defense technology companies, and is currently an investor in companies supplying drones to Ukraine.)

This represents a profound shift in warfare, largely instigated by Ukraine to compensate for its shortfalls in conventional weapons and manpower. In the world's first drone war, drones determine how battles are won and how soldiers die: Ukrainian drone strikes now account for 90 percent of destroyed Russian tanks and armored vehicles and 80 percent of Russian casualties. They have also made it possible for each side to attack far past the frontlines without having to gain air superiority over the battlefield. Ukraine, for example, hit Russian airbases 5,000 miles from Kyiv in June by smuggling drones across the border and launching them from the beds of trucks.

Russia, for its part, was originally slower to field drones in large numbers. But it has dramatically increased its production of first-person-view drones, as well as those used for strategic bombardment, such as the Iranian-designed Shahed. Today, Moscow matches Kyiv's extraordinary rate of technological adaptation. It has developed equally capable models, such as the Orlan, which is used for surveillance, and the Lancet, which loiters over a target before exploding on impact.

Because Russia and Ukraine are constantly iterating on hardware, software, and tactics, the war changes at a breathtaking rate. The saturation of drone surveillance, for example, has made nearly all troop movement visible and therefore vulnerable, creating a transparent battlefield: anything that moves near the frontline is struck within a matter of minutes. Drone pilots have become prime targets, and with many traditional weapons rendered obsolete, drones are increasingly fighting other drones. Amid this cycle of innovation, the two sides are inching toward a new frontier: entirely automated warfare.

Surveillance and reconnaissance drones have become so ubiquitous that both Russian and Ukrainian forces scarcely move in the daylight. During a recent visit, we witnessed the motion of a single Russian van, five miles from the frontline, cause a sensation among drone operators, who then destroyed it. To avoid detection, movement near the frontline tends to take place during sunrise and sunset, when neither the daylight video cameras nor night-vision infrared cameras operate properly.

The fight for information advantage is always important in war, but even more so in this one, where it means the ability to form and maintain resilient drone-based sensor networks over the battlefield. If a unit is “blinded”—unable to maintain surveillance drones overhead—it becomes exceedingly vulnerable. For that reason, roughly 3,000 Ukrainian troops work around the clock to operate reconnaissance drones, mostly Chinese-made DJI Mavics, along the entire 750-mile frontline. Ukrainian brigade command centers display as many as 60 of these drone feeds around the clock.

This transparency means that the military maxim “what can be seen can be hit” is truer on today's battlefield than at any point in history. It is nearly impossible for either side to mass and maneuver forces along the frontline, as troops are now easily spotted forming up for attack. The Russian army has historically relied on its ability to deliver impressive firepower through concentrated tube and rocket artillery fire, but these tactics are useless when any attempt to amass forces is identified within minutes. Russian guns are now widely dispersed, deeply dug in, and operate primarily at night.



Fil says his team has expanded from 400 troops in 2023 to over 1,000 now, and he expects it to continue to grow in the coming months. The brigade's frontline operations are driven by data, of which there is more every day. Fil's brigade, for example, tracks every engagement, drone mission, and vehicle or piece of equipment hit. That data, in turn, drives decision-making, including over the kinds and quantities of drones to procure. Fil's team spends nearly $2 million each month on small quadcopters, mostly Mavics, for frontline reconnaissance and more than $500,000 per month for longer-range fixed-wing surveillance drones, such as Sharks or Lelekas, that can be used to see much farther from the frontline.

This is expensive, but one new battle tank costs more than $10 million. A tank was long regarded as the best weapon to defeat another tank; now, a first-person-view drone costing less than $800 is, thanks to its ability to strike with precision and move much faster than any ground vehicle. No armored vehicle—no matter its camouflage or anti-drone barriers—can survive for long on the modern, drone-swept battlefield. As a result, Ukrainian soldiers believe tank-led assaults to be suicidal. Russia still launches them occasionally, but most do not make it to the front line.

In response, Russia has shifted primarily to infantry assaults. It is no surprise, then, that more than 75 percent of Ukrainian drones now target infantry. Because surveillance drones have a difficult time spotting scattered infantry in urban terrain and forests, the Russians are deploying small assault groups, typically consisting of five or six teams of two to three people, to simultaneously attack a concentrated area. In recent months, the Russians have turned to motorcycles to more rapidly cross no man's land—a shocking contrast to the line of tanks that rolled toward Kyiv in the earliest days of the conflict. When surviving members of a Russian assault group reach a building, they immediately dig in. Gradually, more soldiers join them. Over days or even weeks, the Russians gather their forces until they judge that they have sufficient strength to make the next bound toward Ukrainian positions. According to an officer from Ukraine's Azov Brigade, Russia's “cheap infantry”—its disregard for soldiers' survival—allows for this kind of constant experimentation.

Because drones have become so important to almost all battlefield operations, destroying them has become critical. Drone-on-drone battle is now a central part of the war. Last year, an estimated 1,200 Russian surveillance drones were operating behind Ukrainian lines on a given day, so Ukraine built the first drone-based air defense system to fend them off. Its forces began using first-person-view drones to chase down larger, slower, and much more expensive surveillance drones. Russian surveillance drones now fly higher to avoid Ukrainian interception. Still, roughly 80 percent of all surveillance drones that cross the frontline, be they Russian or Ukrainian, are shot down by either interceptors or traditional air defenses. Because of these changes, Russia has dramatically reduced its use of Lancet drones. Instead, it has developed smaller, faster, and camouflaged surveillance drones, including some with rear-facing cameras, that let operators spot and evade pursuing drones. 

Unsurprisingly, drone pilots and their control stations have become prime targets for both sides. Fil's unit has found that a successful attack on Russian Mavic operators can pause enemy activity for three days. Because pilots have become such a precious resource, integral to defending the infantry, Ukraine is working to relocate as many of them as possible away from the frontlines to integrated remote operations. In an attempt to further decrease the number of forward-deployed soldiers, Ukraine is now working to establish a so-called drone line along its entire frontline—a layered defense corridor six or seven miles wide, made up of obstacles such as ditches, minefields, and razor wire, and hundreds of drone teams that wait at the ready to destroy any targets before they reach Ukrainian positions. Once this barrier is in place, and more drone functions are automated, far fewer troops will need to defend the frontline. Ukraine hopes that this approach will help alleviate its manpower shortfalls and save lives.

Behind the frontlines, tactics are evolving just as fast. On a nightly basis, Russia launches hundreds of Shahed long-range drones at Ukraine, particularly its major cities. Russia increasingly uses sequenced launches and circuitous route planning so that multiple drones arrive at their target simultaneously from different directions; these attacks amount to manually coordinated “drone swarms.” Short of air defense systems, Ukraine has prioritized the development and production of interceptor drones to counter these swarms. Russia also sends dozens of cheaper “dummy” drones—drones without real capabilities—into Ukrainian airspace, forcing air defense radars to reveal their locations. Russian ballistic and cruise missiles then route around the defenses to strike their targets.

The speed of technological adaptation and iteration—or innovation power—is a new measure of combat strength. The key to adaptation is the lightning-fast feedback loop from operator to engineer. The best Ukrainian drone pilots, therefore, are both tactician and technician, able to make modifications and improvements on the fly.

Consequently, the most important progress in drone development is happening at the front. Operators are supported by research and development labs and manufacturing and repair facilities located near the frontlines. Drone teams constantly test and deploy new radios, antennas, and circuit boards; software updates are pushed out on a near-daily basis. To create an effective weapon now requires adapting and iterating against an equally adaptive adversary, resulting in a highly dynamic contest of action and reaction.

Once a new weapon or technique is introduced to the battlefield, it has a limited window of utility before the opponent develops countermeasures. New kinds of drones appear at a rapid rate: two years ago, the Russian Lancet was the most threatening model. Last year, it was the first-person-view drone. Now, strike drones controlled by fiber-optic cables, first fielded by the Russians, have taken hold of the frontline.

Unlike drones that run on standard radio frequency, these quadcopters spool up to 25 miles of fiber-optic cable in their wake, leaving them hard-wired to their operator. Although these drones are slow and limited by the length of their wire, they are impervious to jamming, relay clear images, and can operate outside radio line of sight, which means that they are well suited for hilly and urban terrain. Since they do not emit radio signals, their pilot's location cannot be identified by electronic means, and they strike with shocking precision.



Fiber-optic drones are effective ambush weapons. Russians fly them across the frontline and park these models on roads or rooftops and wait for passing vehicles. Their high-quality control signal and camera resolution allows them to be maneuvered with pinpoint accuracy into tight areas, such as buildings and bunkers, that normal first-person-view drones, which rely on radio, cannot access. Russia now has elite units of drone pilots using fiber-optic drones stationed along heavily contested parts of the frontline in order to target Ukrainian drone operators, attack enemy supply lines, and ultimately isolate forward units.

Drone innovation is not just about making drones better but also about driving down their cost. Over the course of the past year, both Ukrainian and Russian drone units have replaced the pricey few with the inexpensive plenty. Expensive drones, including the Russian Lancet and the American Switchblade 600, which each cost between $65,000 and $150,000, are being pushed aside in favor of fixed-wing strike drones, such as the Russian Molniya and the Ukrainian Dart, both of which cost less than $3,000. Because Molniya kamikaze drones are so cheap, Russia uses them as a mass strike weapon, sometimes launching 15 at a single target.

For the most part, Ukraine still uses first-person-view drones because they are cheap, relatively easy to use, and readily available. Brigades on the most active fronts consume more than 5,000 of them per month. But because their rate of success in striking a target is low, estimated at no more than ten percent for the average unit, many frontline units favor larger bomber-type drones for their versatility, reusability, and modular configurations. A single Ukrainian-made Vampire hexacopter drone, for example, can drop antitank mines or rain down munitions on enemy infantry, achieving the same effect as dozens of artillery rounds, and with greater precision. And because they are both reusable and have a larger payload than first-person-view drones, bomber drones can saturate the ground with high explosives much more rapidly and at much lower cost. They are also better at targeting infantry when repelling assaults and can collapse buildings with a few accurately placed explosives that would otherwise have taken hundreds of artillery rounds.

Bomber drones can also place mines, a tactic that is quickly becoming one of the most effective ways to halt Russian assaults. Russian units on the attack must use largely predictable routes because of terrain, so Ukrainian forces create a dynamic, mobile minefield by dropping mines in their path. Ukrainian forces then use first-person-view drones to herd Russian vehicles toward the mines. One Ukrainian brigade estimates that 50 percent of enemy vehicle kills in recent months have resulted from drone mining. Ukrainians also use bomber drones to run continuous waves of attacks, similar to artillery bombardments, to keep Russian infantry suppressed, underground, and unable to advance.

Ukraine still employs its legacy systems, such as artillery, to support its drone tactics. When Russian infantry are protecting a valuable target, for instance, Ukrainian troops use artillery to suppress the infantry so that Ukrainian bomber drones can destroy the target without being shot down. Ukrainian troops will also use surveillance drones to ascertain where Russian drone pilots are before shelling those locations. These approaches allow Ukraine to minimize its use of expensive legacy systems that can be difficult to acquire; Russia, by contrast, has less need to adapt its use of these systems because it can afford to expend shells in quantities that Ukraine cannot.

Automating drones with artificial intelligence would solve a variety of problems facing the modern warfighter. A large number of drones are lost to pilot error. And the Ukrainian battlefield is saturated with systems that jam and spoof signals across the electromagnetic spectrum, making it difficult to rely on any technology that requires constant radio connection to a human operator. Thousands of Ukrainian troops operate Mavics all day, every day, a function that could certainly be automated. Collecting and processing surveillance data automatically—ideally from multiple layers of sensors across the frontline—would save hundreds of man-hours a week. And current systems require drone pilots to operate close to the frontline, putting them at risk.

Today, algorithms can augment human control of the battlefield. They reduce error by helping pilots detect, track, approach, and strike targets. AI targeting systems are trained nightly on combat footage to adjust to Russian countermeasures, such as camouflage or decoys. Ukrainian and Western companies are creating software that supports drone pilots even more, by selecting routes, stabilizing flights, navigating to waypoints, recognizing targets, and guiding toward the destination. If these efforts are successful, becoming a drone pilot will require fewer skills and less experience.

In particular, defense firms are keen to develop AI tools that make it easier to carry out the final phase of an attack. The Ukrainian battlefield is a challenge for machine learning because enemy tanks and artillery pieces constantly change appearance with added armor and camouflage. Algorithms also perform poorly at identifying scattered infantry, particularly in dense forests or other complex terrain. AI-assisted target acquisition and terminal guidance have already proved effective even in the face of radio signal jamming. Although the future of fully autonomous drones is unclear, a more autonomous drone strike complex—one that combines reconnaissance and strike drones to identify, track, and hit moving targets—would enormously improve Ukraine's ability to defend against Russian attacks.



Defense companies are also racing to create AI that can coordinate attacks by multiple drones in an automated drone swarm—the holy grail of drone operations. Today, Ukrainian forces can form a carousel of drones over a target to repeatedly strike at it, but doing so requires multiple pilots and operators. With an automated drone swarm, a single pilot could guide many drones, flying independent routes, to overwhelm defenses and saturate a target.

To pull off such a feat, defense firms will need to develop AI-powered systems that enable drones to communicate automatically—not just with one another but also with a host of sensors. These networks exist, but not at the required scale. And the task is getting harder each day: as the drone-versus-drone war escalates, the quantity of drones deployed in each operation will grow from hundreds to thousands, making their automated coordination increasingly difficult.

Eventually, Ukraine will need its own version of Israel's Iron Dome air defense network to protect its cities and factories from Russia's constant drone and missile raids. Of course, Ukraine's vast size makes this a daunting challenge, but it can begin by shielding its major cities. Greater automation will be key to fending off Russian attacks. Whereas the first phase of the war was defined by hardware, with each side competing to invent new kinds of drones, payload, and munitions, the next phase of the war will be determined by software.

Drones have upended the old ways of war. Military doctrine, tactics, and organization will never be the same. Armies everywhere will need to completely revamp their doctrine and training to reflect the realities of fighting on a drone-swept battlefield. And the best way to prepare for the future of combat is to speak to those fighting this war.

Historians often call World War II a “war of factories.” The same is true for the war in Ukraine today. Ukraine produced more than two million drones in 2024 and plans to make over four million by the end of 2025. Its adversary is also getting better at drone production: last year, Russia was building 300 Shahed drones a month. Now, it can produce 5,000 in the same time frame. The side that consistently builds the most drones is the one most likely to prevail. And it is in the interest of the West, and of the United States in particular, to support the Ukrainian people in their dogged determination to win that fight—not only for Ukraine's sake but also for its own, so it can learn to reckon with this new reality of war.

 Alexander Kustov

Growing opposition to immigration is reshaping global politics. A promise to ruthlessly crack down on immigration helped Donald Trump win a return to the White House in 2024. In his first week back in office, Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border. Since then, his administration has ramped up immigration raids on businesses, threatened widespread deportation, and canceled temporary legal status for more than a million people living in the United States. Even as voters have soured somewhat on the administration's extreme tactics, more Americans approve of Trump's immigration policies than they do any of his actions in other areas.

The United States is not an outlier when it comes to public hostility toward immigration. Anti-immigration parties have gained popularity across the globe. Far-right parties, which often base their appeal on bashing immigrants and calling for tighter border controls, are now the most popular political force in Europe. Even center-left governments, such as that of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, have felt obliged to embrace hard-line immigration measures out of fear of losing further ground to the surging far right.

Defenders of immigration often argue that they have both the facts and the morals on their side. Immigration is not a zero-sum game: more immigration can boost local and national economies while improving the fortunes of people seeking better lives. Immigration advocates blame racial prejudice or misinformation for opposition to immigration and point to demagoguery that scapegoats vulnerable immigrants for economic and social problems. Although prejudice and ignorance likely play some role in shaping attitudes—and elite politicians are powerful forces in driving public opinion—the fact is that many citizens have genuine concerns about immigration that cannot be ignored. These include practical worries about whether the state can maintain order, promote fair job competition, and ensure that housing and public services do not become overstretched.

But these concerns do not mean that the only viable immigration policy is one that is as harsh as it is cruel. Finding a better political solution must start with understanding what drives public backlash to immigration. Many citizens are deeply troubled by mismanaged flows of people into their country. This concern stems from a failure of policy, not of messaging. Until decision-makers craft more targeted immigration policy that straightforwardly focuses on how immigrants can provide economic benefits, anti-immigrant attitudes and parties will continue to gain ground.

Most observers believe that governments should be more responsive to voters on immigration, but they often fail to understand what the public wants. One popular approach to addressing the anti-immigrant backlash is to set numerical targets, such as the United Kingdom's goal of reducing “net migration.” This reflects a tendency to think of immigration as a numbers game. If governing parties assume that voters simply want fewer immigrants, they pursue policies to limit overall immigration. But research shows that even when mainstream politicians embrace hard-line positions such as capping the number of new immigrants, they still fail to win over disaffected voters.

In fact, few people care about immigration numbers in the abstract. Research shows that there is no correlation between public opposition to immigration and actual immigration levels. Small inflows have sparked intense controversy even in cosmopolitan places—as happened, for example, with the arrival of tens of thousands of asylum seekers in New York City in 2022. By contrast, far larger waves, such as the European Union's reception of millions of Ukrainians after Russia's 2022 invasion or Israel's acceptance of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe after the fall of the Soviet Union, drew less resistance. The lack of direct connection between public attitudes and numbers of immigrants also helps explain why people living in areas with relatively few immigrants can still strongly oppose immigration when the issue is salient nationally.

The vast majority of voters in rich democracies don't have especially fixed views on immigration across the board. Only ten to 20 percent of voters seek to either shut borders completely or open them to all comers. For everyone else, views on immigration depend on whether they believe the new arrivals will benefit the country and the specific details of immigration policies. If voters perceive new immigrants as helpful to their community and the country at large, they are likely to support more immigration and reject strict anti-immigration politics.

In other words, voters assess immigration not on whether it affects them personally, but on how it affects society. In my research, I found that citizens in the United Kingdom opposed immigration if they believed it harmed their fellow citizens. But they were willing to countenance new immigrants if they felt the country as a whole would be better off. Data from other countries reveals similar patterns: survey respondents presented with policies designed to benefit the country's economy, such as attracting immigrants to fill labor shortages, are more likely to support them. A large majority of people in the United States—including Trump supporters who cheer on his harsh immigration crackdowns—favor attracting new high-skilled professionals who can help maintain the United States' technological edge.

But the incoherence of current immigration polices has generated widespread distrust and opposition to immigration in the United States. This is not just a problem of unconvincing rhetoric. Rather, the immigration system is so convoluted and mismanaged that few people believe that immigration can possibly help the country thrive. Congress is stuck in a perpetual cycle of trying to broker a grand bipartisan solution of trading pathways to citizenship for border security, which then fails to satisfy anyone. The immigration system has become so broken—and immigration debates so toxic—that it can be hard for any voter to imagine how immigration could be in the U.S. public interest.

In an ideal world, citizens would accurately perceive the exact benefits of an immigration policy on society. Or, with enough rhetorical swagger, a charismatic pro-immigration politician could provide them with facts that would convince them to support immigration policies whose benefits outweigh the costs to society. Unfortunately, politics is never so simple. But better designed policies can help build support for immigration.

Examples from a variety of wealthy democracies suggest that immigration policies focused on addressing a host country's economic needs are more likely to win support than immigration policies rooted in humanitarian concerns. Consider Sweden, where far-right anti-immigration parties have swelled in response to recent waves of immigration. In the last few decades, Sweden has welcomed hundreds of thousands of refugees and their relatives without considering income or skills. Policymakers have provided generous support to newcomers as part of the country's long-standing commitment to asylum and equality. Before 2000, Sweden did not even count immigration for work as a separate category in its immigration statistics.

The uncomfortable fact is that foreign-born people in Sweden, many of whom arrived as asylum seekers, on average pay less in taxes than the state spends on benefits to support them. These recent arrivals have stoked social tensions and raised concerns about the growing strain on the welfare state. Widely publicized violent incidents in immigrant neighborhoods became national flashpoints, which the public linked to a failure to integrate new immigrants into Swedish society. The sense that the immigration system is not working has fueled the rise of the Swedish Democrats, a far-right party, since the 2010s.



To be sure, economists have argued that accepting even low-skilled immigrants typically has knock-on effects that contribute to economic growth and benefit society. Immigrants can fill essential jobs and push native-born workers into higher-paying positions. They can help revive depressed communities in rural or post-industrial areas. But most voters cannot see these benefits, which, if they occur, are widely spread out and become evident only many years later.

Canada, by contrast, has built a system that admits large numbers of immigrants but is selective in doing so. To attract needed workers, the Canadian government uses a points-based approach that prioritizes people with rare or sought-after skills. Immigrants are admitted largely based on what they can contribute to society in the near term. The immigration process uses transparent criteria, such as education or regional demand for workers, which most voters can understand.

This policy has been remarkably successful. Canada has one of the highest immigration rates per capita in the world. Although some citizens have expressed vocal concerns about housing strain and student visa abuse, the Canadian government has moved swiftly to tighten immigration oversight and recalibrate admissions to maintain the trust of voters who still generally feel that the immigration system works for the country. As a result, anti-immigrant demagogues have gained little traction in national politics.

Determining who can immigrate based on a points rubric or where workers are needed may seem cold and unfeeling in the face of the deeply human imperatives that drive international migration. But such a policy is the only viable path to a more open immigration system. As my research shows, no democracy has ever managed to ease widespread immigration concerns without being very selective about whom to admit. Cross-national data also reveals that more selective countries such as Canada are admitting more immigrants of all kinds. In other words, Canada's experience shows that when immigration policies are demonstrably aligned with national needs, they build public goodwill that can later extend to more vulnerable newcomers, including refugees.

A points-based system to admit “the best and brightest” is just one of many possible policies that can make immigration popular. Any policy that primarily focuses on solving visible national problems while signaling control of population flows is likely to make the public feel good about immigration, while those that explicitly sideline citizens' interests are more likely to spur backlash, resentment, and populism. Immigration policies that focus on filling labor shortages, revitalizing struggling regions, or supporting family reunification of immediate relatives can all win public support.

Some politicians will always seek to exploit immigration anxieties, exaggerate problems, and spread misinformation. But it is easier to do in Sweden than in Canada. This isn't because Canadians are more tolerant, nor is it because their leaders have found the perfect communication strategy to sway the population. Rather, it's because voters can see that Canadian immigration policies work. The more that democratic governments take public concerns seriously and craft immigration policies that clearly benefit society in ways people can understand, the less space there is for xenophobic populists to claim that only they have the country's interests at heart.

Responsible democratic governments serious about making immigration politically viable must also be willing to compromise. Immigration debates are often framed in binary terms—open versus closed, pro-immigration versus anti-immigration, nationalist versus cosmopolitan. But real solutions lie in which types of immigration policies countries pursue. Work-oriented policies, rather than humanitarian-based ones, are more likely to command broad support. Sweden has finally begun moving in this direction by introducing more selective immigration criteria. Inspired by Canada, Germany has also adopted its own version of a points-based immigration system; in 2024, the country issued ten percent more skilled worker visas than the year prior.



Implementing a points-based system will not solve all problems, however. How such a system is designed matters for its success. Many so-called merit-based proposals—such as some of those Republicans have proposed in the U.S. Senate in the past decade—will not help if their primary aim is to find a new way to cut overall admissions. Instead, what builds public support is an immigration policy visibly tied to labor demand, immediate work authorization for new arrivals, and publicly reported benefits of immigration that voters can understand.

Advanced democracies could also adopt immigration policies tied to demonstrable regional needs. For instance, U.S. states could issue visas for workers who have the skills to meet a labor shortfall they face, such as licensed nurses for understaffed hospitals in Michigan or eldercare aides in Minnesota. These policies are most effective when visas are designed to be portable across approved local employers and the policies lay out a path to permanent status for workers after a period of sustained employment. Canada's Provincial Nominee Program and Australia's Regional Visa program are examples that can serve as models for U.S. policymakers.

Similarly, governments can establish bilateral employment partnerships to fast-track visas or permanent residency status for workers from a specific country with relevant skills. These partnerships can apply to fields with national labor shortages, such as eldercare, construction, engineering, or artificial intelligence. Australia and South Korea have established effective regional programs that prepare and train workers from other countries and then match them to verified jobs with wage floors.

These types of targeted, narrow immigration policies can help voters recognize immigration's benefits to their country. The logic is the same as for dedicated taxes: voters often support tax increases when they know exactly how their tax money will be used. Voters do not necessarily want less immigration; they want immigration that they can see working. When citizens see immigration policies that are effective—bringing in doctors at understaffed hospitals, entrepreneurs who create jobs, or caregivers who support aging populations—they also see their own communities benefiting.

The fact that targeted, well-managed immigration policies are more popular than purely humanitarian approaches does not preclude helping those in need. But efforts to assist refugees and displaced people must also demonstrate their benefits to society to avoid backlash. Governments are more likely to gain public support when they strictly enforce immigration rules, quickly provide accepted refugees with the right to work, match them to open jobs, and expand the role of communities and private companies in sponsoring new arrivals. When willing citizens and employers share the costs, everyone—including politicians, workers, and even asylum seekers—can also share in the benefits.

12:06 JST, August 12, 2025

A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island's coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse.

According to the lawsuit filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Friday, Ohtani's agent, Nez Balelo, increasingly demanded concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding that their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal.

“Balelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani's promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs' role in the project — for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,” the lawsuit claims.

The suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture.

A spokesman for Balelo's agency, CAA Baseball, declined comment. Attempts to reach Kingsbarn officials for comment were not immediately successful.

“This case is about abuse of power,” the lawsuit says. “Defendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built.

“Defendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants' misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all — celebrity or not.”

Ohtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series.

Investment materials for The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort, which remained online on Monday night, listed Hayes and Matsumoto as part of the management team, along with Kingsbarn. It called Ohtani “Japan's Babe Ruth” and the “1st Resident,” giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, “one of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,” Hapuna Beach, “rated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler” and two golf courses – one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr.

“Ohtani will act as the celebrity spokesperson for the project and has committed to purchasing one of the 14 residences within the project,” the brochure says. “He also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training.”

The suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and “as part of a bold marketing strategy” signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, “one of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable.”

“This partnership with Ohtani will elevate the demand and create buzz within the Japanese luxury vacation home market, which is a primary target audience for the project,” the investment brochure said. “We see Shohei Ohtani's homeownership as having a significant impact on the global exposure of the project and expect to accelerate the pace of sales, thereby helping us achieve our pricing objectives.”

The suit said Balelo “quickly became a disruptive force,” threatening to pull Ohtani from the deal if concessions weren't made.

“Kingsbarn began capitulating to Balelo's every whim,” the suit said. “Over time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with Otani than honoring its obligations to its business partners.”

Last month, in what the suit called “a coordinated ambush,” Kingsbarn fired Hayes and Matsumoto.

“Kingsbarn openly admitted during the call that Balelo had demanded the terminations and that they were being done solely to placate him,” the suit said. “Plaintiffs stand to lose millions of dollars in compensation tied to projected homebuilding profit, construction management fees, and broker commissions.”

MOSCOW, August 12. /TASS/. The reliable construction of Russia's Su-34M fighter bomber allows the aircraft and its crew to emerge unscathed from belly landing, the Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper reported.

"The reliability of this aircraft has already become a legend. This spring, the Russian fourth-generation fighter-bomber successfully landed on its belly, with its wheels up. Notably, the crew and the aircraft were unscathed," the newspaper wrote.

The emergency situation occurred when the chassis and the nose wheel failed to deploy. Under these circumstances, pilots are allowed to eject. However, the crew asked the permission to perform a belly landing and thus save the aircraft.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story. 

A plant producing synthetic sapphires in the Russian city of Stavropol was hit by drones overnight on Aug. 12, the Russian independent Telegram news channel Astra reported, citing local residents. 

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the reports at the time of publication. Ukraine rarely comments on reports of attacks on industrial facilities in Russia. 

Residents of Stavropol in Russia's southern Stavropol Krai said that drones were attacking the city's JSC Monocrystal plant. Footage taken by locals shows smoke rising from the same street where the factory is located, according to Astra. 

Locals also reported explosions, and photos from the scene show a fire at the attack site. 

Earlier in the night, Stavropol Krai Governor Vladimir Vladimirov issued a drone warning for the area. Following the attack, Stavropol Mayor Ivan Ulyanchenko said the drone attack had been "repelled" and that there were no casualties. 

Ulyanchenko did not mention the strike on the Monocrystal factory, claiming only that windows had been broken at an unnamed "social facility." 

Monocrystal is one of the world's leading manufacturers of synthetic sapphire, which is used in optoelectronics, solar energy, and the aerospace industry. Synthetic sapphire is used in optical systems, sensors, and lasers, including military devices. 

Monocrystal is a subsidiary of Energomera, an electronics and manufacturing company. 

Kyiv regularly attacks industrial and military sites in Russia using domestically produced long-range drones in an effort to degrade Moscow's ability to wage war in Ukraine. In late July, Ukraine's State Security Service (SBU) confirmed that a drone strike hit the Signal radio plant in Stavropol Krai.

The technology provides connectivity when traditional cellular networks are unavailable, particularly during power outages from Russian strikes on critical infrastructure.

The General Staff said more than 110,000 Russian troops are concentrated in the Pokrovsk area and are attempting to penetrate defenses by sending small infantry units between Ukrainian lines.

Russian forces advanced toward the Dobropillia–Kramatorsk highway in Donetsk Oblast, seizing positions in nearby settlements to support further offensive operations.

The strike targeted a logistics hub in the village of Kizil-Yul, roughly 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from Ukraine, igniting a fire at the site. 



The proposal aims to address concerns over the country's declining student population and the growing risk of losing young talent abroad.

The move comes as gasoline prices in Russia have jumped nearly 50% since the start of the year, with Ai-95 setting record highs for five consecutive days. 



The Polish police detained more than 100 people over the weekend following an Aug. 9 concert of Belarusian rapper Max Korzh at Warsaw's National Stadium.



The statement comes as the Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState reported that Russian forces made a push toward the Dobropillia–Kramatorsk highway in Donetsk Oblast.

"The only sensible action for EU leaders is to initiate an EU-Russia summit, based on the example of the U.S.-Russia meeting," Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.

The rally, scheduled for Aug. 14 in Anchorage, is being held to protest the "presence of an international war criminal" and as a show of solidarity with Ukraine, Stand Up Alaska said.



The Financial Times identified 7 million square meters of new industrial development after tracking changes at 150 facilities across 37 companies, namely those associated with ammunition and missile production.

Editor's note: This article has been updated to include the latest report from Ukraine's General Staff.

Russian forces have made a push toward the Dobropillia–Kramatorsk highway in Donetsk Oblast, seizing positions in nearby settlements to support further offensive operations, the Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState reported on Aug. 11.

The updated map, compiled by DeepState through a mix of open-source data and testimonies from units on the ground, shows the grey zone touching the highway, which was used regularly by civilian and military traffic as recently as mid-July. 

Dobropillia lies 94 kilometers northwest of Russian-occupied Donetsk, and about 22 kilometers north of the embattled city of Pokrovsk.

Leveraging their numerical superiority, Russian forces have advanced into Kucheriv Yar, Zolotyi Kolodiaz, and Vesele, where they are reportedly consolidating positions for a renewed offensive and full occupation, according to DeepState.

Russian troops are also attempting to establish a foothold in Petrivka and Novovodiane, on the other side of the highway.

The Russian push, an extension of the Russian offensive between Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast that has been underway since spring, gained pace dramatically over August, bringing key Ukrainian logistics routes into the range of Russian first-person view (FPV) drones.

Piercing the Ukrainian defense far west of the main agglomeration of Ukrainian-controlled cities in Donetsk Oblast — Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Druzhkivka, and Kostiantynivka — these latest gains threaten to severely compromise Kyiv's overall defense of the war-torn eastern region.

New fortifications have been built around Zolotyi Kolodiaz, Shakhove, and nearby settlements — positions that Russian forces are currently bypassing but may seize and repurpose for defensive use in future operations, DeepState said.

"After final consolidation and accumulation, attempts to move deeper into the territory will be inevitable, and drone crews will be brought in, which will complicate the restructuring of alternative logistics and the maintenance of surrounding positions by Ukrainian forces," the report read.

"With this development of events, if it does not change, we may encounter a situation where Dobropillia falls faster than Pokrovsk."

Ukraine's General Staff said in its evening update that Russian forces carried out 35 assaults in the Pokrovsk area on Aug. 11 . The heaviest fighting was reported near Poltavka, Popiv Yar, Mayak, Dorozhne, Nikanorivka, Kucheriv Yar, Nove Shakove, Novoeekonomichne, Sukhetske, Rodynske, Promin, Udachne, Lysivka, Zvirove, and Horikhove, with three battles still underway.

The General Staff said Russian troops are exploiting their numerical advantage, attempting to "breach Ukrainian lines in small groups despite sustaining heavy losses." 

"The Commander-in-Chief has decided to deploy additional forces and resources to detect and destroy enemy sabotage groups that are penetrating the defense line," the announcement said. 

The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify these reports. The press officers of two Ukrainian brigades known to be fighting in the area declined to comment on the situation.

The news comes as Russia, facing the prospect of peace talks, has aimed to surge forward on the front line to put itself in the best position at a potential negotiating table. 

The hottest parts of the front line remain in Donetsk Oblast, where Ukrainian brigades, all severely understrength in infantry, are battling to hold the line against a Russian attacking force that has learned to target weak points in the Ukrainian defense.

Civilian evacuations from contested or occupied areas remain extremely dangerous, with Russian forces repeatedly accused of targeting non-combatants.

Message comes after Texas Democratic lawmakers stymied another GOP effort to gain more seats at president's behest

Texas Democrats once again stymied a Republican effort to redraw the state's congressional maps at the behest of Donald Trump, and Gavin Newsom, the California governor, urged the president to stand down and defuse the redistricting arms race that has spread across the country.

Enough Texas Democrats remained outside of the state on Monday to deny the Republican-led state legislature the quorum necessary to proceed with Trump's desired congressional map. Dozens of Democratic state lawmakers left the state on Sunday, taking refuge in blue states such as Illinois and New York. They have spent the last week working to raise awareness and rally support for their efforts to block the Republican redistricting plan.

The standoff has widened the redistricting wars, with Newsom and other Democratic state leaders threatening to draw retaliatory maps if Texas moves ahead with its redistricting scheme.

In a letter to Trump on Monday, Newsom said the president was “playing with fire” and warned that California was prepared to consider new boundaries to “neutralize” any gains Republicans hope to achieve in Texas.

“This attempt to rig congressional maps to hold onto power before a single vote is cast in the 2026 election is an affront to American democracy,” Newsom wrote.

The governor said he would prefer to leave the matter of congressional map-making to independent commissions, not partisan legislative bodies and emphasized that he would “happily” stand down if other states abandoned their redistricting effort. But, Newsom said: “California cannot stand idly by as this power grab unfolds.”

In a snarky, all-caps tweet meant to mimic Trump's social media style, Newsom's office summarized the letter: “DONALD TRUMP, IF YOU DO NOT STAND DOWN, WE WILL BE FORCED TO LEAD AN EFFORT TO REDRAW THE MAPS IN CA TO OFFSET THE RIGGING OF MAPS IN RED STATES. BUT IF THE OTHER STATES CALL OFF THEIR REDISTRICTING EFFORTS, WE WILL DO THE SAME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But when asked, Trump has defended the Texas plan, arguing that he is “entitled to five more seats” because he won the state's popular vote in the 2024 presidential election. The argument, however, is flawed – a popular vote win does not necessarily mean a president's party is awarded more congressional seats.

Despite Newsom's appeal, the White House is seeking to enlist other red states in the redistricting clash. Last week, vice-president JD Vance traveled to Indiana, where he met with state Republican leaders to lobby them on the effort. Republicans have also targeted Ohio and Missouri.

At a press conference with several quorum-breaking Texas lawmakers, as well as California's legislative leaders, Newsom outlined his plan to ask voters to override the existing congressional maps drawn by an independent commission and accept a new proposal to create five more Democratic-leaning seats. The governor expressed confidence that voters would approve the plan and said the state legislature would act in time to get the measure on the ballot this November.

Kathy Hochul, the New York governor, and JB Pritzker, the Illinois governor, have also vowed to take action.

At the Texas capitol in Austin, Dustin Burrows, the state house speaker, adjourned the session moments after opening it on Monday, in a fourth failed attempt since the Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, convened a special session in large part to approve a mid-decade redistricting plan aimed at flipping five Democratic-held seats and securing a GOP house majority in the 2026 midterm elections.

In brief remarks, Burrows said the department of public safety had deployed special agents across Texas to locate the absent Democrats who have civil warrants out for their arrest. Agents, he said, were set up outside the members' homes, conducting surveillance, repeatedly knocking on their doors and calling their phones.

“So far, no one is home,” he said, adding: “The search continues and it will not stop.”

DPS has set a tip line for the public to report any information regarding the “whereabouts” of the Democratic lawmakers. But those out of state are beyond the reach of Texas authorities.

Since Sunday, Texas Republicans have ratcheted up the political, legal and financial stakes for the Democrats who left.

The Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, a far-right ally of the president, asked the state supreme court to vacate the seats of 13 out-of-state Democrats. He also asked an Illinois court to enforce the Texas civil warrants. Abbott has separately asked the state supreme court that seeks to remove Gene Wu, the house Democratic leader, from office. John Cornyn, a Republican US senator facing a rightwing primary challenge by Paxton, has said the FBI agreed to assist Texas authorities locate the Democrats, though the agency declined to comment and it remains unclear what authority federal law enforcement would have, as they are not charged with federal crimes.

The Democrats have indicated that they intend to stay away until at least the end of the current special session on 19 August. Speaking earlier on Monday from Illinois, Texas state lawmaker Mihaela Plesa said she and her Democratic colleagues were “more committed than ever” to stopping Trump from gaining Republican seats. “We don't take our marching orders from a man who thinks he's a king,” she said, adding: “We don't back down when the stakes are high.”

But the Texas governor has vowed to call special sessions again and again until enough return to the state house.

“If they show back up in the state of Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the capitol,” Abbott said in a weekend interview on Fox News Sunday.

Burrows claimed that the members would be responsible for “every gallon of gas, every mile traveled, and every hour of overtime” spent trying to track them down. Under legislative rules, they face a $500 daily fine for each absence.

Burrows said the House would attempt to reconvene again on Tuesday.

Live Updates


• DC crackdown: A day after President Donald Trump announced he is placing the Washington, DC, police department “under direct federal control,” the White House said the police will seek to dismantle any remaining homeless encampments in the district and those who don't comply could face jail.
    


• Bondi meeting: DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, after meeting Attorney General Pam Bondi, said she's focused on “how to make the most of the additional officer support that we have.”
    


• 30-day deployment: White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump's order deploying the National Guard in DC will be reevaluated in 30 days. The president has repeatedly complained about rising crime in DC, but overall violent crime numbers have fallen after a 2023 spike.
    


• Looking ahead: Meanwhile, Trump will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin one-on-one in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday, according to the White House, which characterized the summit as a “listening exercise” on the war in Ukraine.
    


            It's a busy week for President Donald Trump as the administration's asserts its control of Washington, DC's Metropolitan Police Department while the US leader prepares for a meeting Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            If you're just joining us, here's what you need to know:
    


Federal control of DC police:



Trump-Putin summit:



CNN's Maureen Chowdhury, Holmes Lybrand, Kevin Liptak, Casey Gannon, Shania Shelton, Donald Judd, Adam Cancryn, Kit Maher, Ted Barrett, Helen Regan, Nina Subkhanberdina, Catherine Nicholls and Betsy Klein contributed to this post.



            DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro was pressed today on what changes she'd like to see when it comes to sentencing and punishment for those who commit the crimes in the city. She was also asked what she can do in her position under the Trump administration's federal takeover of DC.
    


            “I don't have any special powers. I wish I did,” Pirro said.
    


            The Trump administration has continued to deny statistics that the overall crime rates in DC have decreased over the past year, which Pirro also addressed.
    


                    “Anyone who wants to tell me the crime is down and that we don't need an emergency focus on crimes of violence, all they need to do is take a look at this and talk to the loved ones and the family members of these individuals all shot and killed,” Pirro said.
                





            She was asked about DC crime during a news conference announcing an indictment against Haitian gang leader Jimmy Cherizier, also known as “Barbecue.”
    


            The DC Metropolitan Police Department will seek to dismantle any remaining homeless encampments in the district, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters today.
    


            Those who don't comply and move to homeless shelters or addiction or mental health services “will be susceptible to fines or jail time,” she added.
    


            Leavitt cited the MPD's authority under local laws to clear the city's homeless encampments, telling reporters, “these are pre-existing laws that are already on the books.”
    


                    “They have not been enforced, which is part of the reason for this nationalizing of the National Guard, to bring in this assistance for law enforcement while we are targeting criminals and trying to remove criminals off of the streets,” she said. “We also want to make DC safe and beautiful, and that involves removing mentally disturbed individuals and homeless encampments as well.”
                





            She touted the work US Parks Police have done to break up homeless encampments across the city, telling reporters that 70 have been removed from the city's parks since March, with the remaining two slated for this week.
    


            And the press secretary said the administration is “exploring” how to move homeless people “FAR from the Capital” as Trump suggested in a Truth Social post Monday.
    


                    “We're exploring how we could do that — but again, homeless shelters, offered addiction and mental health services, or jail if they refuse, are the options on the table right now, and we'll continue to explore that option,” she said.
                





            The head of the Drug and Enforcement Administration is functionally “in charge” of Washington, DC's Metropolitan Police Department during the Trump administration's takeover of law enforcement within the city, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said today.
    


            President Donald Trump tapped Terrance Cole as interim federal commissioner of the DC Metropolitan Police Department.
    


            “Terry Cole, as you heard from this briefing room yesterday, is in charge of the Metropolitan Police Department, and he's working with the chief to ensure that law enforcement officers are allowed to do their jobs in this city,” Leavitt told CNN's Kaitlan Collins.
    


            The assertion came after DC leaders signaled they did not expect significant organizational changes at the department because of the federal takeover, while vowing to work with their federal partners and seeking to downplay any controversy.
    


Earlier today: When asked if she answered to Cole, MPD Police Chief Pamela Smith responded, “I answer to Mayor Muriel Bowser.”
    


            And Bowser said, “Our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, how we make changes — none of that has changed.”
    


            Leavitt characterized Cole as tasked with working with Smith, adding that both of them would report up to Attorney General Pam Bondi for the duration of the 30-day federal takeover.
    


            She also declined to rule out the possibility of firing DC police officers, while noting that there are no current plans to do so.
    


            “I would imagine it means they have the ability,” Leavitt said of the potential for personnel changes. “As for any changes, I'm not tracking any.”
    


            President Donald Trump will meet one-on-one with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of their summit on Friday in Alaska, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN during the press briefing today.
    


            Trump expects to focus squarely on ending the war in Ukraine, leaving other issues the Kremlin has said could be up for discussion — including normalizing US-Russia ties — for another time.
    


Why this matters: Trump and Putin have met individually, without aides, previously. In 2017, they met alone during their first encounter at the G20 summit in Hamburg. Then in 2018, they sat one-on-one in Helsinki, Finland, after which Trump sided with Putin over US intelligence agencies on the question of Russian election interference.
    


            Both encounters included translators but not high-ranking aides. After the Germany meeting, Trump reportedly asked his translator for his notes.
    


            It's not atypical for leaders to meet alone with their counterparts, but Trump and Putin's relationship has been the subject of intense scrutiny. And during Trump's first term, even senior officials said they sometimes were left in the dark about what was discussed when aides were left out.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov today discussed the upcoming meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, according to Russia's foreign ministry.
    


            Rubio and Lavrov spoke about “certain aspects of preparation” for the meeting, which will take place on Friday in Alaska, the Russian foreign ministry said.
    


            “Both sides confirmed their commitment to a successful meeting,” it said.
    


            The US State Department also released a readout of the conversation with similar details.
    


The post has been updated with confirmation of the discussion from the US State Department.



            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that President Donald Trump is mainly focused “making DC safe and beautiful again,” when asked about his remarks about crime in other cities in the country.
    


            Trump called out Chicago, New York and Los Angeles for their crime rates when he announced his plans to take control of the DC Metropolitan Police Department yesterday.
    


                    “Look, the president is speaking about what he'd like to see take place in other cities around the country,” Leavitt told reporters. “Right now, this administration is focused on making DC safe and beautiful again … but I will note that the president wants to see all of our nation's cities be safe. But I think starting with our nation's capital is a great place to begin, and it should serve as a model for the rest of the country.”
                





For context: Memphis, Cleveland and St. Louis have the highest overall crime rates among US cities with a population of at least 250,000, according to the FBI's Crime Database. Washington, DC, is ranked 10th.
    


            Memphis, Detroit and Baltimore top the database for violent crime rates among cities of at least 250,000 people, while Washington, DC, ranks 17th.
    


            These numbers rely on reporting from local jurisdictions and are not exhaustive of all crime that occurs.
    


The CNN FactCheck team contributed reporting to this post. 



            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it was “unfortunate” that a federal judge this week rejected the Trump administration's efforts to unseal grand jury materials relating to Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking case.
    


            “We think that decision is unfortunate. Of course, we moved to unseal that information because the president has said he wants to see credible evidence released,” Leavitt said at today's White House briefing.
    


            Leavitt deferred to the Department of Justice when asked if the administration plans to appeal.
    


            President Donald Trump is traveling to Anchorage for a bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said as she nodded to the fact that Ukraine will not be represented.
    


            The logistics of the event, including timing and plans for a potential joint press conference, are “still being ironed out,” she told reporters at today's White House press briefing.
    


            The White House characterized President Donald Trump's upcoming meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “listening exercise,” appearing to downplay expectations for a peace deal heading into the high-stakes summit in Alaska on Friday.
    


                    “This is a listening exercise for the president. Look, only one party that's involved in this war is going to be present, and so this is for the president to go and to get, again, a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end,” Leavitt told reporters at the White House briefing.
                





            “Sitting face to face, rather than speaking over the telephone, will give this president the best indication of how to end this war and where this is headed,” she said.
    


            President Donald Trump is considering “suing” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said today.
    


            This comes after Trump posted on Truth Social earlier in the day that he was “considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed.”
    


            Leavitt declined to elaborate further, deferring to Trump.
    


            President Donald Trump's order to take control of Washington, DC's Metropolitan Police Department will be reevaluated in 30 days, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.
    


            Asked about the timeline of Trump's efforts, Leavitt said:
    


                    “As for the timing, we will reevaluate and reassess and make further decisions after this 30-day period is up, but within these 30 days, our entire focus is making sure that this is the most efficient operation possible.”
                





            Trump can retain control for 30 days if he notifies certain members of Congress, which he has done. Any request of over 30 days must be passed into law.
    


            The press secretary added that the administration's focus will be to clean up DC “as best we can” and that it will work with the MPD to do so.
    


            More than 20 people were arrested in Washington, DC, yesterday following the deployment of hundreds of officers and agents after President Donald Trump declared a crime emergency in the city, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.
    


            “Approximately 850 officers and agents were surged across the city. They made a total of 23 arrests, including multiple other contacts last night,” Leavitt told reporters at the the White House.
    


            Leavitt said people were arrested for “homicide, firearms offenses, possession with intent to distribute, narcotics, fare evasion, lewd acts, stalking, possession of a high capacity magazine …  driving under the influence, reckless driving and a bench warrant.”
    


            The press secretary said authorities also seized six illegal handguns as well.
    


            Leavitt said the administration will continue its efforts over the next month to “relentlessly pursue and arrest every violent criminal in the district who breaks the law, undermines public safety and endangers law-abiding Americans.”
    


For context: Crime, violence and guns landed at the top of the list when DC residents were asked to name the biggest problem facing the District today in a Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted this spring. The poll suggests, though, that the sense of crime as a major problem is down from recent years.
    


Overall violent crime numbers are lower in the nation's capital after a spike in 2023.

            President Donald Trump is participating in virtual Ukraine talks tomorrow, a White House official told CNN.
    


            German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said yesterday he was planning to host a virtual meeting with Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders to discuss the war in Ukraine.
    


            It comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday.
    


CNN's Christian Edwards contributed reporting. 



            Washington, DC, councilmember Brooke Pinto said that deploying the National Guard is “not the answer” to reducing crime in the city, as local leaders and Democrats push back on the Trump administration's enforcement crackdown.
    


            Pinto also voiced support for Mayor Muriel Bowser and DC Police Chief Pamela Smith during an interview on CNN, urging them to “make sure” that the administration's takeover of city resources “doesn't last longer than 30 days,” as outlined in the president's executive order.
    


                    “If these folks are going to be here in addition to our city, we want to make sure it is helpful to our efforts of crime fighting and not harmful,” Pinto said of the elevated federal law enforcement presence.
                





            During the interview, Pinto acknowledged crime concerns with pushback on what she characterized as a heavy-handed response from the Trump administration.
    


            “I'm proud of the progress that we've made leading to this 30-year low of violent crime. But I am also the first to say we have to do more — reality and safety have to be true for everyone in DC, and we take seriously our responsibility here that we're also the nation's capital,” Pinto said.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi released a statement on X following her meeting this morning with Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser.
    


            Bondi said in the statement that she and Bowser agreed to keep tourists and residents in the city safe from “deadly crime” and that they will continue to work closely together to carry out the president's orders.
    


            However, there is no additional clarity on leadership structure or missions of the federal intervention.
    


                    “I just concluded a productive meeting with DC @MayorBowser at the Department of Justice. We agreed that there is nothing more important than keeping residents and tourists in Washington, D.C. safe from deadly crime. At President Trump's direction, @TheJusticeDept will work closely with D.C. city government and @DCPoliceDept to make Washington, D.C. safe again,” Bondi wrote. 
                





            Bowser said that Bondi will be serving as President Donald Trump's proxy to implement his executive order.
    


            Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser said that she's focused on maximizing the surge of federal law enforcement ordered by President Donald Trump rather than dwelling on the circumstances surrounding the situation.
    


            “What I'm focused on is the federal surge and how to make the most of the additional officer support that we have. We have the best in the business in (the Metropolitan Police Department) in Chief Pamela Smith to lead that effort and to make sure that the men and women who are coming from federal law enforcement are being well used … all in an effort to drive down crime,” Bowser told reporters.
    


                    The mayor added that no matter “how we got here or what we think about the circumstances, right now we have more police and we want to make sure we're using them.”
                





            Bowser also said that Attorney General Pam Bondi will be serving as Trump's proxy to implement his order.
    


            “The executive order is clear. The president has requested MPD services, and our Home Rule Charter outlines the process. The president designated Attorney General Bondi as his proxy to request services through me,” Bowser said.
    


            Bowser noted that the organizational chart of how her office and the Metropolitan Police Department work together will remain unchanged.
    


                    “Our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, how we make changes — none of that has changed,” she said.
                





            Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith told reporters she met with Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terrance Cole and United States Marshals Service Director Gadyaces “Gady” Serralta yesterday and today to discuss President Donald Trump's order to take control of the city's police department.
    


                    “We have been working collaboratively. I think it's going to be a good effort. It's going to be an effort that's supported by both teams. The Metropolitan Police Department as well as our federal partners,” Smith said outside the Justice Department.
                





            Cole was tapped as interim federal commissioner of the DC Metropolitan Police Department.
    


            She said that the MPD has provided Cole with a “strategic plan on how we will provide resources around our city.”
    


            She added city officials know that they need to get illegal guns off the streets and the “enhanced presence” of federal law enforcement and resources in the city will help make the city “even better.”
    


            Asked who she responds to amid the federal takeover of DC police, Smith said:
    


                    “I answer to Mayor Muriel Bowser.” 
                





            Additional Department of Justice officials attended the meeting with DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and Attorney General Pam Bondi.
    


            They include:
    


            President Donald Trump will meet with South Korea President Lee Jae Myung on August 25, a White House official told CNN today.
    


            The South Korean leader's upcoming visit to Washington comes on the heels of a July trade deal in which the US agreed to reduce its reciprocal tariff on South Korean goods from a proposed 25% to 15%.
    


            The lower rate also applies to South Korean automobiles, one of the country's top exports to the United States. As part of the deal, South Korea committed to purchasing $100 billion in US energy and investing in the American economy.
    


            Lee took office on June 4.

Fox News correspondent Alexandria Hoff has the latest on how the Justice Department will run Washington, D.C.'s police force on 'Special Report.'

A crowd rental company has seen a massive uptick in inquiries regarding its services in Washington, D.C., amid President Donald Trump's move to federalize the police force in the nation's capital. 

"Right now, D.C. inquiries are up roughly 400% compared to the same period in 2024," Crowds on Demand CEO Adam Swart told Fox News Digital, adding that the time period he is referencing is May to July 2024. 

The company always sees a spike in requests during what Swart calls "high-stakes political moments."

TRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS—BUT SOME WELCOME IT

"A large share are focused on opposing Trump's policies in Washington and raising alarms about government overreach," Swart said. "We're weighing those offers carefully – because while there's truth in saying D.C.'s local government has been an abject failure in keeping citizens safe, there's also a real danger in putting too much power in federal hands. That balance of power matters." 

Swart said the "vast majority" of people at political or advocacy events in D.C. are in some way paid. 

"Most people don't know this, but many protesters are literally on the payroll – Capitol Hill staffers from both parties are often expected to show up at rallies and protests on their own time," he said. "So yes, most attendees are being paid or are there because it's part of their job. That doesn't mean they don't support the cause – but it does mean these crowds aren't as ‘organic' as they appear on TV."

TRUMP CLAIMS DC CRIMES TROUNCE STATS FROM NOTORIOUSLY VIOLENT CITIES WORLDWIDE

On Monday, Trump announced that District of Columbia National Guard troops will be activated to patrol the streets in Washington, and that the federal government will take control of the Metropolitan Police Department. 

Trump cited unchecked violent crime as the reason for the takeover, which he announced a week after former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer Edward Coristine and his girlfriend were subject to an attempted carjacking on Aug. 3. Coristine was left beaten and bloodied. 

Upon learning of Coristine's victimization, Trump first floated the idea in a post on his TRUTH Social platform.

He said criminals in the city are not afraid of the police because "nothing ever happens to them."

"The most recent victim was beaten mercilessly by local thugs," Trump wrote. "… Perhaps it should have been done a long time ago, then this incredible young man, and so many others, would not have had to go through the horrors of Violent Crime. If this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

Some of the 800 National Guard members deployed by President Donald Trump began arriving in Washington D.C. on Tuesday, ramping up after the White House ordered federal forces to take over the city's police department and reduce crime in what the president called — without substantiation — a lawless city.

The law lets Trump control the police department for a month, but how aggressive the federal presence will be remains an open question. 

Following a meeting with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Tuesday morning, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser emphasized that the Metropolitan Police Department will retain its independence, including over hiring and firing, saying “our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, none of that has changed.”

“We have more police, and we want to make sure we use them,” Bowser added. The remarks marked a change in tone from Monday when Bowser called Trump's executive order “unsettling and unprecedented.”

Other news we're following today:








Leavitt says Trump's goal for his meeting with Putin this week is “to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war.”

The White House press secretary downplayed the president's aims for the summit on Friday in Alaska. She described the meeting as “a listening exercise for the president” that he agreed to after Putin requested a meeting.

Leavitt declined to discuss Trump's conversations with Zelenskyy but said Trump has “deep respect” for all parties.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says approximately 850 federal law enforcement officers were deployed in Washington and made 23 arrests overnight.

Leavitt says the arrests include charges of homicide, gun and drug crimes, reckless driving, fare evasion and drunken driving.Leavitt said six illegal handguns were seized.

“This is only the beginning,” she said, pledging that federal authorities would continue policing in the nation's capital for a month.

“President Trump will not be deterred by soft on crime democrats and media activists,” Leavitt said

“THIS IS YOUR SECOND-TO-LAST WARNING!!!” Newsom's press office wrote Tuesday in a X post urging the president to back off efforts to redraw congressional maps.

California Democrats are planning to introduce new partisan maps on Friday to counter efforts to help GOPs in 2026 in Texas.

“STAND DOWN NOW OR CALIFORNIA WILL COUNTER-STRIKE (LEGALLY!) TO DESTROY YOUR ILLEGAL CROOKED MAPS IN RED STATES,” the post reads.

The new maps in California would still need state lawmakers and voters approval. State Republicans vow to challenge the effort.

The Swiss Association of Precious Metals Manufacturers and Traders on Tuesday said it was awaiting a formal decision after Trump wrote “Gold will not be Tariffed!” on his Truth Social platform late Monday.

“President Trump's statement is an encouraging signal for trade stability,” said Christoph Wild, the president of the association, which counts 15 companies that process and trade in precious metals like gold. “However, only a formal and binding decision will provide the certainty the gold sector and its partners require.”

The Swiss National Bank, citing figures from the Swiss government, in April issued a report saying that gold refineries in Switzerland supply about one-third of refined gold worldwide.

Last year, gold accounted for some 27% of goods trade value from the country, making it Switzerland's most-traded product — ahead of pharmaceuticals at 22%, the SNB said.

The precious metals association, known as ASFCMP, last week expressed concern following news reports and other indications that the Trump administration might apply whopping 39% U.S. tariffs on Swiss products -- among the highest it has imposed anywhere -- to gold products. 






Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser says the city will aim to “make the most of” the increase in federal resources in the city after Trump's announcement that he's taking over Washington's police department and activating 800 members of the National Guard.

Bowser also emphasized that the Metropolitan Police Department will retain its independence, including over hiring and firing, saying “our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, none of that has changed.”

“We have more police, and we want to make sure we use them,” Bowser added after a meeting with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.

The remarks mark a change in tone from Monday when Bowser called Trump's executive order “unsettling and unprecedented.”

Pamela Smith, chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, spoke about reduced crime in the city and said increased federal resources “will only help us build upon that.”

Bondi called the meeting with Bowser “productive” in a statement on X, adding that the Justice Department will work closely with city government and police.

Moore, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, was first elected to Congress in 2020. He has the rare distinction of winning elections in two different congressional districts.

Last year, a federal court ordered Alabama to use a new congressional map, which put Moore's home outside his own district. Rather than moving to seek his old seat, he opted to challenge his fellow GOP incumbent in a hard-fought primary for the more solidly Republican 1st District.

Now he's seeking the position being vacated by Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who's running for governor. The rare open Senate seat is expected to draw a number of candidates and Alabama's Republican attorney general has already entered the race.

Hours after Paramount and UFC announced a billion-dollar rights deal, Dana White said he had yet to hear from his friend, President Trump, on his thoughts about the fight company's new streaming home.

That was fine with White. The UFC CEO was set to travel to Washington on Aug. 28 to meet with Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, to catch up and discuss logistics on the proposed Fourth of July fight card next year at the White House.

Trump said last month he wanted to stage a UFC match on the White House grounds with upwards of 20,000 spectators to celebrate 250 years of American independence.

“It's absolutely going to happen,” White told The Associated Press. “Think about that, the 250th birthday of the United States of America, the UFC will be on the White House south lawn live on CBS.”

The federal judge ordered the administration to stop withholding funding approved by Congress for the nonprofit that aims to strengthen democratic institutions around the world.

U.S. Judge Dabney Friedrich in Washington said Monday it was clear the State Department was blocking the money for “impermissible policy reasons,” and she rejected the department's explanation that it was trying to ensure the endowment had funding for the upcoming year.

“Before and during litigation, the defendants obstructed routine drawdown requests on money already set aside in the Endowment's Treasury account, imposed and then abandoned a novel waiver requirement, and delayed the obligation of apportioned funds,” she wrote. “These actions vitiate any inference that the defendants' concern has been to ‘ensure' the Endowment's ‘level of funding in the coming fiscal year.'”

Friedrich granted a preliminary injunction sought by the endowment for its remaining 2025 funding — $95 million, or about a third of its annual funding.

The State Department did not immediately have comment.

A Justice Department investigation concluded that leaders of George Washington University were “deliberately indifferent” to complaints of antisemitism stemming from pro-Palestinian protests last year.

In a Tuesday letter to the university's president, the Justice Department said George Washington violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by failing to address the harassment of Jewish students amid a campus tent encampment. The department said it will pursue enforcement action unless the university agrees to a voluntary resolution agreement.

The university did not immediately comment.

The Trump administration has issued similar findings at Harvard, Columbia and the University of California, Los Angeles. The government has used a deal with Columbia as a template for agreements with other universities.

The tent encampment at George Washington lasted about two weeks starting in April 2024 before it was cleared by police.

It's a closely watched appointment by the two-term governor, who can't run for reelection in 2026 and has been working to cement his legacy as his time leading the state winds down.

If Collins, an Army combat veteran and nonprofit executive, decides to launch a bid to succeed DeSantis, the move could tee up another proxy fight between the popular GOP governor and President Trump, who's already endorsed U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds for the job.

During a Tuesday news conference announcing his pick, DeSantis praised Collins for having strong conservative principles.

Collins was then sworn in minutes after the announcement.

The seat had been vacant since February, when then-lieutenant governor Jeanette Nuñez was appointed to lead one of the state's public universities.

That's according to a White House official.

The Europeans hope to use the Wednesday meeting to rally Trump to Ukraine's cause ahead of his Friday summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Trump has disappointed allies in Europe by saying Ukraine will have to give up some Russian-held territory. He also said Russia must accept land swaps, although it was unclear what Putin might be expected to surrender.

Trump said Monday he's “going to get everybody's ideas” before meeting with Putin.

The White House is holding off on publicly releasing the much-anticipated “MAHA” strategy report that's supposed to provide a policy road map for making Americans healthier.

The policy recommendations are a follow up from the MAHA report released in May, which focused on ultraprocessed foods, prescription drugs, vaccines, screentime and pesticides.

The initial report had already divided some conservatives, with farmers concerned about its focus on pesticides and some from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s coalition upset that the report didn't call for a ban on those chemicals.

White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that the report is “on track” to be submitted to President Trump on Tuesday and will be unveiled to the public “shortly thereafter.”

The attorney general is expected to meet Tuesday with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser a day after the president put the city's police force under federal control.

Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith was also seen entering Justice Department headquarters ahead of the planned meeting.

Trump said Monday that Bondi would assume responsibility for the police department in the hopes of reducing crime, even as city officials stressed crime is already falling.

Trump called Fed chair Jerome Powell a “loser” Tuesday and demanded that he cut the central bank's short-term interest rate. Such rate reductions can, over time, reduce borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and business loans.

Trump also said he might allow a “major lawsuit” to proceed against the Fed over the burgeoning cost of its massive renovation of two office buildings, currently expected to cost $2.5 billion, up from a previous estimate of $1.9 billion. It's not clear what lawsuit Trump was referring to.

It was unclear whether even Ukraine will take part in the summit. Trump has said he wants to see whether Russian leader Vladimir Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year.

Trump has disappointed allies in Europe by saying Ukraine will have to give up some Russian-held territory. He also said Russia must accept land swaps, although it was unclear what Putin might be expected to surrender.

The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia's energy might to try to intimidate the EU, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them.

It comes after data suggested inflation across the country was a touch better last month than economists expected.

The S&P 500 rose 0.6% and was on track to top its all-time high set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 251 points, or 0.6%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was 0.7% higher and also heading toward a record.

Stocks got a lift from hopes that the better-than-expected inflation report will give the Federal Reserve more leeway to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September.

Lower rates would give a boost to investment prices and to the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment. President Trump has angrily been calling for cuts to help the economy, often insulting the Fed's chair personally while doing so.

It's a boost to the incumbent lieutenant governor's effort to set himself up as the 2026 frontrunner for the GOP nomination.

Trump announced the nod Monday, noting Jones was among the first Georgia Republicans to endorse Trump's first bid for the White House in 2016 and saying Jones “worked tirelessly to help us win” in all three of Trump's bids.

“He has been with us from the very beginning,” Trump wrote on social media. “I know his family well and have seen Burt tested at the most difficult levels and times.”

Republicans including Attorney General Chris Carr are vying with Jones to be their party's nominee to succeed Gov. Brian Kemp, who can't run again because of term limits. Other Republican candidates who could enter the race include Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.

National Guard troops are beginning to arrive at the Washington, D.C., armory. They were seen arriving this morning at the Guard's headquarters in the city.

Trump said Monday that in hopes of reducing crime, he would be taking over Washington's police department and activating 800 members of the National Guard. The crime Trump talked about is the same crime that city officials stress is already falling noticeably.

The Republican president, who had himself installed as chairman of the Kennedy Center's board, said in a social media post that the to-be-named nominees are “GREAT.”

“GREAT Nominees for the TRUMP/KENNEDY CENTER, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, AWARDS,” Trump wrote in a social media post. “They will be announced Wednesday.

“Tremendous work is being done, and money being spent, on bringing it back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment,” he said, without offering details.

The Kennedy Center Honors program typically tapes in December for broadcast later in the month on CBS.

Trump spurned the performing arts center in his first term after some honorees refused to attend a traditional White House event recognizing their achievements to protest Trump's policies, including those toward the arts. He did not attend the taping of the awards program during those four years in office.

There is nothing on the president's public schedule today. However, press secretary Karoline Leavitt will hold a briefing at 1 p.m. ET.






Here's a few of the headlines the AP has published in the last 24 hours:

Trump took command of the police department and deployed the National Guard under laws and Constitutional powers that give the federal government more sway over the nation's capital than other cities. The measure still leaves significant power to the president and Congress, though no president has exercised the police powers before. 

Here's a look at what the law says about Trump's actions:

1. Trump activated the National Guard. The president can still call up the National Guard in Washington. His authority is less clear in Los Angeles, where a legal battle continues over his recent deployment of the National Guard despite the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom.

2. Trump took over the local police. Section 740 of the Home Rule Act allows for the president to take over Washington's Metropolitan Police Department for 48 hours, with possible extensions to 30 days, during times of emergencies. No president has done so before. 

3. Trump didn't specify how long the takeover would last. Congress still has power over things like the budget and laws passed by the city council, but would have to repeal the Home Rule Act to expand federal power in the district.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday that President Trump's announcement of his takeover of D.C. police force were “unsettling” but not without precedent.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Some of the 800 National Guard members deployed by President Donald Trump began arriving in the nation's capital on Tuesday, ramping up after the White House ordered federal forces to take over the city's police department and reduce crime in what the president called — without substantiation — a lawless city.

The influx came the morning after Trump announced he would be activating the guard members and taking over the department. He cited a crime emergency — but referred to the same crime that city officials stress is already falling noticeably. The president holds the legal right to make such moves for at least a month.

Mayor Muriel Bowser pledged to work alongside the federal officials Trump has tasked with overseeing the city's law enforcement, while insisting the police chief remained in charge of the department and its officers. 

“How we got here or what we think about the circumstances — right now we have more police, and we want to make sure we use them,” she told reporters. 

The tone was a shift the day before, when Bowser said Trump's plan to take over the Metropolitan Police Department and call in the National Guard was not a productive step and argued his perceived state of emergency simply doesn't match the declining crime numbers. Still, the law gives the federal government more sway over the capital city than in U.S. states, and Bowser said her administration's ability to push back is limited. 




Attorney General Pam Bondi, meanwhile, called the Tuesday morning meeting productive in a social media post and said the Justice Department would “work closely with the D.C. city government” to “make Washington, D.C., safe again.” 

While Trump invokes his plan by saying that “we're going to take our capital back,” Bowser and the MPD maintain that violent crime overall in Washington has decreased to a 30-year low after a sharp rise in 2023. Carjackings, for example, dropped about 50% in 2024 and are down again this year. More than half of those arrested, however, are juveniles, and the extent of those punishments is a point of contention for the Trump administration.

Bowser, a Democrat, spent much of Trump's first term in office openly sparring with the Republican president. She fended off his initial plans for a military parade through the streets and stood in public opposition when he called in a multi-agency flood of federal law enforcement to confront anti-police brutality protesters in summer 2020. She later had the words “Black Lives Matter” painted in giant yellow letters on the street about a block from the White House.

In Trump's second term, backed by Republican control of both houses of Congress, Bowser has walked a public tightrope for months, emphasizing common ground with the Trump administration on issues such as the successful effort to bring the NFL's Washington Commanders back to the District of Columbia. 

She watched with open concern for the city streets as Trump finally got his military parade this summer. Her decision to dismantle Black Lives Matter Plaza earlier this year served as a neat metaphor for just how much the power dynamics between the two executives had evolved. 

Now that fraught relationship enters uncharted territory as Trump has followed through on months of what many D.C. officials had quietly hoped were empty threats. The new standoff has cast Bowser in a sympathetic light, even among her longtime critics. 

“It's a power play and we're an easy target,” said Clinique Chapman, CEO of the D.C. Justice Lab. A frequent critic of Bowser, whom she accuses of “over policing our youth” with the recent expansions of Washington's youth curfew, Chapman said Trump's latest move “is not about creating a safer D.C. It's just about power.”

Bowser contends that all the power resides with Trump and that her administration can do little other than comply and make the best of it. As long as Washington remains a federal enclave with limited autonomy under the 1973 Home Rule Act, she said, it will remain vulnerable to such takeovers.

“We know that access to our democracy is tenuous,” Bowser said. “That is why you have heard me, and many many Washingtonians before me, advocate for full statehood for the District of Columbia.” 

Section 740 of the Home Rule Act allows the president to take over Washington's police for up to 30 days during times of emergencies. No president has done so before, said Monica Hopkins, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union's D.C. chapter. 

“That should alarm everyone,” she said, “not just in Washington.”

For Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects an escalation of his aggressive approach to law enforcement. The District of Columbia's status as a congressionally established federal district gives him a unique opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime.

“Let me be crystal clear,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said during Trump's announcement news conference. “Crime in D.C. is ending and ending today.”

Trump's declaration of a state of emergency fits the general pattern of his second term in office. He has declared states of emergency on issues ranging from border protection to economic tariffs, enabling him to essentially rule via executive order. In many cases, he has moved forward while the courts sorted them out.

Bowser's claims about successfully driving down violent crime rates received backing earlier this year from an unlikely source. Ed Martin, Trump's original choice for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, issued a press release in April hailing a 25% drop in violent crime rates from the previous year. 

“Thanks to the leadership of President Trump and the efforts of our ‘Make D.C. Safe Again' initiative, the District has seen a significant decline in violent crime,” Martin said. “We are proving that strong enforcement, and smart policies can make our communities safer.”

In May, Trump abandoned his efforts to get Martin confirmed for the post in the face of opposition in Congress. His replacement candidate, former judge and former Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, was recently confirmed. On Monday, Pirro — standing next to Trump — called his takeover “the step that we need right now to make criminals understand that they are not going to get away with it anymore.”

﻿The question is whether a Republican judiciary will read the entire law governing Trump's power over DC, or just the part that Trump likes.

On Monday, President Donald Trump released an executive order invoking a rarely used federal law that allows him to temporarily seize control over Washington, DC's police force. Later the same day, DC's Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser seemed to concede that there's nothing she can do about it.

“What I would point you to is the Home Rule Charter that gives the president the ability to determine the conditions of an emergency,” Bowser said Monday afternoon. “We could contest that, but the authority is pretty broad.”

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Bowser is almost certainly correct that Trump can seize control of her city's police force, at least for a little while.

The District of Columbia is not a state, and does not enjoy the same control over its internal affairs that, say, nearby Virginia or Maryland does. The Constitution gives Congress the power to “exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever” over the nation's capital. If Congress wanted to, it could turn DC into a federal protectorate tomorrow.

In 1974, however, Congress enacted the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which generally gives DC residents the power to elect the city's leaders. But that law contains an exception that allows the president to briefly take command of DC's police.

“Whenever the President of the United States determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for federal purposes,” the law provides, the president may require the city's mayor to provide him “such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate.”

The same law, however, also provides that presidential control over DC police must terminate after 30 days, unless Congress takes some action to extend it. So, assuming that the courts actually apply this 30-day limit to Trump, Trump's control over DC's local police will only last a month at most.

Indeed, Trump's own executive order seems to acknowledge that his powers are time-limited. The order requires Mayor Bowser to “provide the services of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act.”

The Home Rule Act, moreover, is fairly adamant that this 30-day limit is real. It provides that, absent congressional action, “no such services made available pursuant to the direction of the President … shall extend for any period in excess of 30 days.” So, if Trump does try to extend the time limit without Congress's consent, the courts should not permit him to do so.

Trump loves to declare emergencies. In his first 100 days in office, he declared eight of them, more than any other president — including himself in his first term. His DC police order is just the latest of these emergency declarations. Trump claims that “crime is out of control in the District of Columbia,” and this supposed situation justifies invoking emergency powers to take control of DC's police.

The idea that DC faces a genuine emergency is a farce. As pretty much everyone who has written about Monday's executive order has noted, violent crime rates in the city are at a 30-year low. So, even if you concede that crime is such a problem in DC that it justifies a federal response, that problem has existed for three decades. A persistent problem is the opposite of an emergency.

That said, Bowser is correct that the Home Rule Act's text permits the president, and the president alone, to determine whether an emergency exists that justifies taking control of DC's police. The relevant language of the statute provides that Trump may invoke this power “whenever the President of the United States determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist.”

Broadly speaking, it makes sense to give the president unreviewable authority to decide when to invoke certain emergency powers. The very nature of an emergency is that it is a sudden event that requires immediate action, without which matters could deteriorate rapidly. Think of a heart attack, a major natural disaster, or an insurrection.

Suppose, for example, that a violent mob attacks the US Capitol during an important national event, such as the congressional certification of a presidential election. When Congress enacted the Home Rule Act, it quite sensibly could have thought that the president should be able to draw upon all nearby law enforcement officers to quell such an attack on the United States — without having to first seek permission from local elected officials, or a judge.

Congress, of course, did not anticipate that the president might be complicit in such an attack. But that doesn't change the fact that the statute says what it says. A nation as large and diverse as the United States cannot function unless its chief executive has the power to take some unilateral actions. If a president abuses that authority, the proper remedy is often supposed to be the next election.

It's worth noting that not every emergency statute is worded as permissively as the Home Rule Act's provision governing local police. In May, for example, a federal court struck down many of the ever-shifting tariffs that Trump imposed during his time back in office. One of the plaintiffs' primary arguments in that case, known as V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, is that Trump illegally tried to use an emergency statute to address an ordinary situation.

Trump primarily relied on a statute known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to justify his tariffs. That law gives him fairly broad authority to “regulate” international transactions, but this power “may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared.”

Thus, the text of IEEPA is quite different from the text of the Home Rule Act. While the Home Rule Act permits the president to act whenever he determines that an emergency exists, IEEPA imposes two conditions on the president. One is that there must be an emergency declaration, but the other is that the president must invoke IEEPA to deal with an actual “unusual and extraordinary threat.”

Trump claims that many of his tariffs are justified because of trade deficits — the United States buys more goods from many nations than it sells — but the US has had trade deficits for at least two decades. So trade deficits are hardly an “unusual and extraordinary threat.”

Some of Trump's invocations of emergency power, in other words, are vulnerable to a legal challenge. But the question of whether any particular invocation may plausibly be challenged in court will turn on the specific wording of individual statutes.

All of this said, the Home Rule Act does contain one very significant limit on presidential power: the 30-day limit. And the statute is quite clear that this limit should not be evaded. Again, it states that “no” services made available to the president “shall extend for any period in excess of 30 days, unless the Senate and the House of Representatives enact into law a joint resolution authorizing such an extension.” (The law also permits Congress to extend this 30-day limit by adjourning “sine die,” meaning that Congress adjourns without formally setting a date for its return, something it typically only does for a brief period every year.)

So what happens if, a month from now, Trump declares a new emergency and tries to seize control of DC's police for another 30 days? If the courts conclude that he can do that, they would make a mockery of the Home Rule Act's text. Presidents should not be allowed to wave away an explicit statutory limit on their authority by photocopying an old executive order and changing the dates.

That said, the Supreme Court is dominated by Republicans who recently held that Trump may use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes. So, while the Home Rule Act is very clear about the 30-day limit on Trump's power, there is no guarantee that this Supreme Court will rule that the law applies to him.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Trump's crime numbers are completely wrong. He's taking over DC police anyway.

Trump finally imposed his new tariffs. Here's what to know.

There's a method to his trade war madness. But major economic and legal risks remain.

The president's protectionism answers a riddle at the heart of American fiscal policy.

The most surprising consequence of Trump's trade war.

Wall Street may be reeling, but it's poor and working-class people who'll be hurt by the Trump's trade war.

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. inflation was unchanged in July as rising prices for some imported goods were balanced by falling gas and grocery prices, leaving overall prices modestly higher than a year ago.

Consumer prices rose 2.7% in July from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, the same as the previous month and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 3.1%, up from 2.9% in June. Both figures are above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. 

The new numbers suggest that slowing rent increases and cheaper gas are offsetting some impacts of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. Many businesses are also likely still absorbing much of the cost of the duties. Tuesday's figures probably reflect some impact from the 10% universal tariff Trump imposed in April, as well as higher duties on countries such as China and Canada. 

Brian Bethune, an economist at Boston College, said that overall U.S. tariffs — calculated as the amount of duties paid by U.S. companies divided by overall imports — has reached 10%, the highest in decades, and will likely keep rising for months.

“Those cost increases will be passed on to the consumer in some way, shape, or form,” Bethune said. Some companies could return to “shrinkflation,” he added, in which they reduce the package size of a good while keeping the price the same.

And companies that are absorbing tariff costs, which would cut into their profit margins, are less likely to hire new employees, he said. 




The Federal Reserve may now be in a difficult spot. 

Hiring slowed sharply in the spring, after Trump announced tariffs in April. The stalling out of job gains has boosted financial market expectations for an interest rate cut by the central bank at its next meeting in September, and some Fed officials have raised concerns about the health of the job market. A rate cut by the Fed often, but not always, lowers borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and business loans.

Economists are divided over how Fed officials will read the data in the coming months. Some argued that the worsening jobs picture will outweigh lingering inflation concerns and lead the Fed to cut at its next meeting in September. Yet some say that with core inflation notably above 2% and rising, the Fed will postpone that decision. 

Chair Jerome Powell has warned that worsening inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines — a stance that has enraged Trump, who has defied traditional norms of central bank independence and demanded lower borrowing costs. 

On Tuesday, Trump attacked Powell again for not cutting rates and suggested he would allow a lawsuit against the Fed to proceed because of the rising costs of its extensive building renovation. It wasn't clear what lawsuit he was referring to.

On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2% in July, down from 0.3% the previous month, while core prices ticked up 0.3%, a bit faster than the 0.2% in June.

Gas prices fell 2.2% from June to July and have plunged 9.5% from a year earlier, the government's report said. Grocery prices slipped 0.1% last month, though they are still 2.2% higher than a year ago. 

Tariffs appeared to raise the cost of some imported items: Shoe prices jumped 1.4% from June to July, though they are still just 0.9% more expensive than a year ago. The cost of furniture leapt 0.9% in July and is 3.2% higher than a year earlier.

Coffee costs nearly 15% more than a year earlier, mostly because of troubled harvests overseas, though steep duties on imports from Brazil could push those prices higher in the coming months. Nearly all U.S. coffee is imported. 

Tuesday's data arrives at a highly-charged moment for the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects and publishes the inflation data. Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, then the head of BLS, after the Aug. 1 jobs report also showed sharply lower hiring for May and June than had previously been reported. 

The president posted on social media Monday that he has picked E.J. Antoni, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and a frequent critic of the jobs report, to replace McEntarfer. 

Adding to the turmoil at BLS is a government hiring freeze that has forced it to cut back on the data it collects for each inflation report, the agency has said. UBS economist Alan Detmeister estimates that BLS is now collecting about 18% fewer price quotes for the inflation report than it did earlier this year. He thinks the report will produce more volatile results, though averaged out over time, still reliable.

Smaller companies are trying to avoid raising prices and some have turned to novel ways of raising funds. 

Clothing maker Princess Awesome, which designs matching clothes for children and adults, has seen its costs jump 15% to 20% because of the tariffs. The company has joined a lawsuit seeking to block the duties. Rebecca Melsky, CEO and co-founder of the firm, says it is prohibitively expensive to make the cotton blend fabrics it uses in the United States. 

For now, the company has instituted a “tip jar” on its website where it asks customers to help defray the cost of goods. 

“We have not across the board raised prices because of the tariffs -- yet,” she said. 

Trump has insisted that overseas manufacturers will pay the tariffs by reducing their prices to offset the duties. Yet the pre-tariff prices of imports haven't fallen much since the levies were put in place. 

Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that foreign manufacturers have absorbed just 14% of the duties through June, while 22% has been paid by consumers and 64% by U.S. companies. Yet the economists expect that by this fall consumers will bear two-thirds of the burden, while foreign exporters pay a quarter and U.S. companies handle less than a tenth. 

Many large corporations are raising prices, including apparel makers Ralph Lauren and Under Armour, and eyewear company Warby Parker. Most of those increases weren't in place for Tuesday's inflation report.

Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said late last month that it would lift prices in August on about a quarter of its products by mid-single-digit percentages. Walmart has also raised prices. 

And cosmetics maker e.l.f. Beauty, which makes a majority of its products in China, said on Wednesday that it had raised prices by a dollar on its entire product assortment as of Aug. 1 because of tariff costs, the third price hike in its 21-year history.

Shohei Ohtani and his agent were hit with a lawsuit by a real estate investor and broker in Hawaii, claiming they got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development by using their celebrity status.

The Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way superstar's agent is accused of increasingly demanding concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto and then demanding that their own business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal.

"[Nez] Balelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani's promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs' role in the project – for no reason other than their own financial self-interest," the lawsuit said, via the Associated Press.

"This case is about abuse of power," the lawsuit continued. "Defendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built.

"Defendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants' misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all – celebrity or not."

Ohtani and Balelo are accused of tortious interference and unjust enrichment, while also undermining their interests in another venture. 

Balelo's agency, CAA, declined to comment on the suit, according to the AP.

Balelo threatened to pull Ohtani from the deal if their own demands weren't met, the suit said.

"Kingsbarn began capitulating to Balelo's every whim," the suit said. "Over time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with Otani than honoring its obligations to its business partners." Ohtani signed his endorsement deal with the developers in 2023.

This is not the first time Ohtani has had off-field drama involving large sums of money. His former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, is serving a prison sentence for theft and fraud after stealing money from Ohtani to pay off gambling debts. The money delivered to bookies was from Ohtani's bank account.

A CNN panel suggested Monday that the "look at the statistics" response from some national Democrats on President Trump's crime plan might come across as "tone-deaf."

A CNN panel suggested on Monday that the Democratic Party's overall response to President Donald Trump's plan to reduce crime in Washington, D.C., might come across as tone-deaf, likening it to the Democratic Party's messaging on the economy during the Biden administration.

"What's striking is that national Democrats are not following Mayor Bowser‘s lead on this, and that national Democrats have been insisting, ‘Just look at the statistics, we have a 30-year low in violent crime.' Whereas Mayor Bowser is talking about, ‘Hey, we need to get 500 more police officers on the streets. We'd like the federal government to help us rebuild our jail,'" Axios reporter Alex Thompson said during a discussion on "The Arena with Kasie Hunt."

"She's also talking about some of the reforms she did to make it so accused violent offenders don‘t get out of jail pretrial. So there is this disconnect, and I've talked to Democrat strategists today that think that national Democrats saying, ‘look at the statistics,' is sort of a tone-deaf way to react," Thompson continued. 

Trump spoke to reporters on Monday about his plan, which was immediately dismissed by top Democrats, who argued that crime is at a 30-year low.

Kristen Soltis Anderson, a CNN political commentator, pointed out that the Democratic Party's reliance on crime statistics mirrored its unsuccessful economic messaging during Joe Biden's presidency.

"Isn't this the exact same problem that Democrats had last year? Look at the statistics. We promise you the economy is great, while people are going, ‘It doesn't feel great to me.' That feels like a lot of this conversation around crime that you can point to statistics all day long that say, ‘Hey, D.C. is safer this year than it was last year,' but do people feel safe?" she observed.

"Bottom line, if they don't, they may be more okay with something that would otherwise be considered extraordinary," Anderson said.

Former Republican lawmaker Peter Meijer chimed in, saying Mayor Muriel Bowser might know something about the possible manipulation of statistics at the D.C. police department. 

"She may know some things that national Democrats are not paying attention to," Meijer said.

"It is also true, crime is one of these things where the randomness of it actually has a big psychological effect, right?" said Jamal Simmons, a former communications director for Kamala Harris.  "When random crime happens along 14th street or one of the big thoroughfares here in the district, people get very animated about it."

CNN host Kasie Hunt also pointed out that a D.C. murder victim Trump referenced during the press conference on Monday, former Trump administration official Mike Gill, who was killed during a carjacking in 2024, was one of her neighbors.

"Violent crime in Washington, D.C. is at a thirty-year low. Donald Trump has no basis to take over the local police department. And zero credibility on the issue of law and order. Get lost," he said.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine military on Tuesday blamed China for the collision of two Chinese navy and coast guard ships while trying to drive the Philippine coast guard and fishermen from a disputed shoal in the South China Sea. It said it would assess how to respond to Beijing's use of military force against civilians.

Philippine authorities said Monday's accidental collision resulted in visibly heavy damages to the Chinese coast guard and navy ships and possible injuries.

The confrontation near the Scarborough Shoal was the latest flare-up of the long-simmering territorial standoff in the contested waters, a long-feared flashpoint in Asia.

The United States, a longtime treaty ally of the Philippines, on Tuesday condemned the “latest reckless action by China directed against a Philippine vessel.”

The Chinese coast guard on Monday blamed Philippine vessels for the confrontation and said it was forced to expel the vessels after they intruded into “China's inherent territory,” despite warnings. It did not mention the collision or possible casualties.

Video footage made public by the Philippine coast guard shows a Chinese navy ship with the bow number 164 slamming into the bow of a Chinese coast guard ship while both try to block and force a Philippine patrol ship, the BRP Suluan, away from Scarborough. The Chinese coast guard ship can be seen using its water cannon.

The video shows the heavily shattered bow of the Chinese coast guard ship, where at least two Chinese personnel were seen standing shortly before the crash. The Chinese navy ship sustained deep dents and what appeared to be linear cuts on its hull.

BRP Suluan offered medical help by two-way radio to the Chinese coast guard, fearing the collision may have caused injuries to its personnel, but the Philippine coast guard said it received no response.




Gan Yu, a spokesperson for the Chinese coast guard in Beijing, said Monday that the Philippine vessels intruded into Chinese territorial waters off the shoal, prompting its forces to take “necessary measures, including monitoring, forcing, intercepting and controlling the Philippine vessels to expel them.”

The chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr., told reporters in Manila that the video footage clearly showed that the Chinese navy ship maneuvered to ram the BRP Suluan, which had to move to avoid being hit. As a result, the Chinese navy ship instead hit the Chinese coast guard ship, which was also closely chasing the Philippine vessel, Brawner said.

“China's aggressive actions were very clear in this incident,” Brawner said. “They were at fault because of their aggressive maneuvers. We were there to protect Filipino fishermen in the Scarborough Shoal. That was our only objective because that's our traditional fishing ground.”

Asked if China's deployment of military force against civilians was a change in tactic, Brawner said it was. He said the Philippine military would assess how to respond in consultation with the coast guard and would seek guidance from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.

“Now they are deploying their PLA navy, and this is one symbol of China's aggressiveness,” he said, referring to China's People's Liberation Army. “We'll discuss possible steps and our future tactics to counter China's actions to stop us from getting access (to Scarborough).”

Chinese officials did not immediately comment on Brawner's statement but Gan Yu insisted its forces would be “resolutely safeguarding China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.”

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis tapped Republican state Sen. Jay Collins to be his next lieutenant governor Tuesday. It's a closely watched appointment by the two-term governor, who can't run for reelection in 2026 and has been working to cement his legacy as his time leading the state winds down.

If Collins, an Army combat veteran and nonprofit executive, decides to launch a bid to succeed DeSantis, the move could tee up another proxy fight between the popular GOP governor and President Donald Trump, who has already endorsed U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds for the job. 

During a news conference announcing his pick at the Green Beret Association in Tampa on Tuesday, DeSantis praised Collins as an “ally” and a principled conservative.

“What I was looking for is someone that can be lieutenant governor that will help us deliver more wins for the people of Florida — and then also that is capable of serving and leading as governor, if that need were ever to arise,” the governor said during the news conference in Tampa, which Collins represents.

Collins was sworn in minutes after the announcement, with his wife Layla and their two young sons at his side, while the governor and first lady Casey DeSantis looked on.

Collins pledged to help deliver on DeSantis' agenda, which he said has made Florida the country's “conservative proving grounds.”

“The goal is to help him finish the mission and keep Florida strong,” Collins said of DeSantis, adding, “you don't flinch when the next mission comes up. You just say, ‘Yes, sir. Let's go.'”




Born in Montana, Collins has talked openly about personal challenges he has overcome, including experiencing homelessness while in high school. He went on to join the Army Special Forces and ultimately lost a leg, but continued to serve five more years as a Green Beret using a prosthetic leg post-amputation, according to a campaign biography. 

Taking the stage Tuesday, Collins made light of the injury he sustained, saying he was proud to serve the country that afforded him so many opportunities.

“I want you to know that I've got my sleeves rolled up, I've got my running leg on, and we are ready to get things done,” Collins said.

In recent years, Collins has served as the chief operating officer of Operation BBQ Relief, which deploys cooks and mobile kitchens to deliver hot meals in the aftermath of natural disasters. In June, Collins also flew to Israel to help support state-funded flights to evacuate Americans as Israel and Iran traded missile strikes.

“Why would you want to go in to Israel when Iran is raining rockets down? Most people would take a pass on that,” DeSantis said of Collins, calling him “the Chuck Norris of Florida politics.”

The seat had been vacant since February, when then-lieutenant governor Jeanette Nuñez was appointed to lead one of the state's public universities. In Florida, the lieutenant governor position is largely ceremonial with few official responsibilities, apart from taking over if the governor cannot serve.

Collins was first elected to Florida's Republican-dominated state Senate in 2022 and has been seen as one of DeSantis' key allies in the Legislature. In recent months, GOP legislators loyal to the president have increasingly sparred with the governor, who challenged Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.

The appointment is seen as a way for DeSantis to elevate a potential successor in 2026, though the governor has repeatedly talked up his wife, Casey DeSantis, for the job, while taking shots at Trump's pick.

Hours after Paramount and UFC announced a billion-dollar rights deal, Dana White said he had yet to hear from his friend, President Donald Trump, on his thoughts about the fight company's new streaming home.

That was fine with White. The UFC CEO was set to travel to Washington on Aug. 28 to meet with Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, to catch up and discuss logistics on the proposed Fourth of July fight card next year at the White House.

Trump said last month he wanted to stage a UFC match on the White House grounds with upwards of 20,000 spectators to celebrate 250 years of American independence.

“It's absolutely going to happen,” White told The Associated Press. “Think about that, the 250th birthday of the United States of America, the UFC will be on the White House south lawn live on CBS.”

The idea of cage fights at the White House would have seemed improbable when the Fertitta brothers purchased UFC for $2 million in 2001 and put White in charge of the fledging fight promotion.

White helped steer the company into a $4 billion sale in 2016 and broadcast rights deals with Fox and ESPN before landing owner TKO Group's richest one yet — a seven-year deal with Paramount starting in 2026 worth an average of $1.1 billion a year, with all cards on its streaming platform Paramount+ and select numbered events also set to simulcast on CBS.

ESPN, Amazon and Netflix and other traditional sports broadcast players seemed more in play for UFC rights — White had previously hinted fights could air across different platforms — but Paramount was a serious contender from the start of the negotiating window.




The Paramount and UFC deal came just days after Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger — kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line. White said he was impressed with the vision Skydance CEO David Ellison had for the the global MMA leader early in contract talks and how those plans should blossom now that Ellison is chairman and CEO of Paramount.

“When you talk about Paramount, you talk about David Ellison, they're brilliant businessmen, very aggressive, risk takers,” White said. “They're right up my alley. These are the kind of guys that I like to be in business with.”

The $1.1 billion deals marks a notable jump from the roughly $550 million that ESPN paid each year for UFC coverage today. But UFC's new home on Paramount will simplify offerings for fans — with all content set to be available on Paramount+ (which currently costs between $7.99 and $12.99 a month), rather than various pay-per-view fees.

Paramount also said it intends to explore UFC rights outside the U.S. “as they become available in the future.”

UFC matchmakers were set to meet this week to shape what White said would be a loaded debut Paramount card. The UFC boss noted it was still too early to discuss a potential main event for the White House fight night.

“This is a 1-of-1 event,” White said.

There are still some moving parts to UFC broadcasts and other television programming it has its hands in as the company moves into the Paramount era. White said there are still moving parts to the deal and that includes potentially finding new homes for “The Ultimate Fighter,” “Road To UFC,” and “Dana White's Contender Series.” It's not necessarily a given the traditional 10 p.m. start time for what were the pay-per-view events would stand, especially on nights cards will also air on CBS.

“We haven't figured that out yet but we will,” White said.

And what about the sometimes-contentious issue of fighter pay? Some established fighters have clauses in their contracts that they earn more money the higher the buyrate on their cards. Again, most of those issues are to-be-determined as UFC and Paramount settle in to the new deal — with $1.1 billion headed the fight company's way.

“It will affect fighter pay, big time,” White said. “From deal-to-deal, fighter pay has grown, too. Every time we win, everybody wins.”

Boxer Jake Paul wrote on social media the dying PPV model — which was overpriced for fights as UFC saw a decline in buys because of missing star power in many main events — should give the fighters an increased idea of their worth.

“Every fighter in the UFC now has a clear picture of what the revenue is...no more PPV excuses,” Paul wrote. “Get your worth boys and girls.”

White also scoffed at the idea that the traditional PPV model is dead.

There are still UFC cards on pay-per-view the rest of the year through the end of the ESPN contract and White and Saudi Arabia have teamed to launch a new boxing venture that starts next year and could use a PPV home. White, though, is part of the promotional team for the Canelo Álvarez and Terence Crawford fight in September in Las Vegas that airs on Netflix.

“It's definitely not run it's course,” White said. “There were guys out there who were interested in pay-per-view and there were guys out there that weren't. Wherever we ended up, that's what we're going to roll with.”

White said UFC archival footage “kills it” in repeat views and those classic bouts also needed a new home once the ESPN deal expires.

Just when it seems there's little left for UFC to conquer, White says, there's always more. Why stop at becoming the biggest fight game in the world? Why not rewrite the pecking order in popularity and riches and go for No. 1 in all sports?

“You have the NFL, the NBA, the UFC, and soccer globally,” White said. “We're coming. We're coming for all of them.”

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A peace deal that requires Kyiv to accept swapping Ukrainian territory with Russia would not only be deeply unpopular. It also would be illegal under its constitution.

That's why President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has categorically rejected any deal with Moscow that could involve ceding land after U.S. President Donald Trump suggested such a concession would be beneficial to both sides, ahead of his meeting Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.

Zelenskyy said over the weekend that Kyiv “will not give Russia any awards for what it has done,” and that “Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.” The remarks came after Trump said a peace deal would involve swapping of Ukrainian territories by both sides “to the betterment of both.”

For Zelenskyy, such a deal would be disaster for his presidency and spark public outcry after more than three years of bloodshed and sacrifice by Ukrainians. Moreover, he doesn't have the authority to sign off on it, because changing Ukraine's 1991 borders runs counter to the country's constitution. 

AP correspondent Harriet Morris reports it is an open question whether Friday's US-Russia summit in Alaska can lead to a deal to produce peace in Ukraine, after more than 3 1/2 years of fighting.

For now, freezing the front line appears to be an outcome the Ukrainian people are willing to accept.




A look at the challenges such proposals entail:

Russia occupies about a fifth of Ukraine, from the country's northeast to the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed illegally in 2014.




The front line is vast and cuts across six regions — the active front stretches for at least 1,000 kilometers (680 miles) — but if measured from along the border with Russia, it reaches as far as 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles).

Russia controls almost all of the Luhansk region and almost two-thirds of Donetsk region, which together comprise the Donbas, as the strategic industrial heartland of Ukraine is called. Russia has long coveted the area and illegally annexed it in the first year of the full-scale invasion, even though it didn't control much of it at the time.

Russia also partially controls more than half of the Kherson region, which is critical to maintain logistical flows of supplies coming in from the land corridor in neighboring Crimea, and also parts of the Zaporizhzhia region, where the Kremlin seized Europe's largest nuclear power plant.

Russian forces also hold pockets of territory in Kharkiv and Sumy regions in northeastern Ukraine, far less strategically valuable for Moscow. Russian troops are gaining a foothold in the Dnipropetrovsk region. These could be what Moscow is willing to exchange for land it deems more important in Donetsk, where the Russian army has concentrated most of its effort.

“There'll be some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody. To the good, for the good of Ukraine. Good stuff, not bad stuff. Also, some bad stuff for both,” Trump said Monday.

Ukrainian forces are still active in the Kursk region inside Russia, but they barely hold any territory there, making it not as potent a bargaining chip as Kyiv's leaders had probably hoped when they launched the daring incursion across the border last year. Swapping Ukrainian controlled territory in Russia, however minuscule, will likely be the only palatable option for Kyiv in any land swapping scenario.

Surrendering territory would see those unwilling to live under Russian rule to pack up and leave. Many civilians have endured so much suffering and bloodshed since pro-Moscow forces began battling the Ukrainian military in the east in 2014 and since the full-scale invasion in 2022.

From a military standpoint, abandoning the Donetsk region in particular would vastly improve Russia's ability to invade Ukraine again, according to the Washington-based think tank Institute for the Study of War.

Bowing to such a demand would force Ukraine to abandon its “fortress belt,” the main defensive line in Donetsk since 2014, “with no guarantee that fighting will not resume,” the institute said in a recent report.

The regional defensive line has prevented Russia's efforts to seize the region and continues to impede Russia's efforts to take the rest of the area, ISW said.

Ukraine's constitution poses a major challenge to any deal involving a land swap because it requires a nationwide referendum to approve changes to the country's territorial borders, said Ihor Reiterovych, a politics professor in the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv.

“Changes in territorial integrity can be done only by the decision of the people — not the president, the cabinet of ministers or the parliament can change it,” he said. “In the constitution it is written that only by referendum can changes to Ukraine's territory be conducted.”

If during negotiations Zelenskyy agrees to swap territory with Russia, “in the same minute he will be a criminal because he would be abandoning the main law that governs Ukraine,” Reiterovych said.

Trump said he was “a little bothered” by Zelenskyy's assertion over the weekend that he needed constitutional approval to cede to Russia the territory that it captured in its unprovoked invasion.

“I mean, he's got approval to go into a war and kill everybody, but he needs approval to do a land swap?” Trump added. ”Because there'll be some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody.”

Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., brought a copy of her country's constitution to her interview on Sunday with CBS' “Face the Nation,” and described how the president is “the guarantor of the constitution” and cannot give away land under Article 133.

Zelenskyy is still trying to regain the people's trust that was damaged when he reversed course on a law that would have diminished the independence of Ukraine's anti-corruption watchdogs. The move was a red line for those citizens who are protective of the country's institutions and are suspicious of certain members of Zelenskyy's inner circle.

Analysts like Reiterovych dismiss a land swap as a distraction. Freezing the conflict along the current front line is the only option Ukrainians are willing to accept, he said, citing recent polls. 

This option would also buy time for both sides to consolidate manpower and build up their domestic weapons industries. Ukraine would require strong security guarantees from its Western partners to deter future Russian aggression, which Kyiv believes is inevitable.

Still, freezing the conflict will also be difficult for Ukrainians to accept.

Along with the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the partial occupation of Luhansk and Donetsk after that, it would require accepting that the Ukrainian military is not able to retake lost territories militarily. Kyiv accepted its inability to retake these territories but never formally recognized them as Russian. A similar scenario could unfold in the new regions taken by Russian forces.

It also is not a viable long-term solution.

“It is the lesser evil option for everyone and it will not provoke protests or rallies on the streets,” Reiterovych said.

Fox News chief correspondent Jonathan Hunt discusses California Gov. Gavin Newsom's response to Texas' redistricting plan on ‘Fox News Live.'

Former NBC host Chuck Todd argued that America is heading towards a "cold civil war" on "The Chuck Toddcast" on Tuesday as redistricting battles in states like Texas and California continue to rage.

Todd contended that the ongoing redistricting battles are "just the latest skirmish between what is turning into a cold civil war," and that it is President Donald Trump and the Republican Party who are "creating this unprecedented challenge to our constitutional republic." 

"I hate using that rhetoric. I hate using those words, but what else are you going to describe it? We are literally having a redistricting war between the states right now, and we have governors who have decided they don't care about the minority rights in their own states," Todd argued. 

"Greg Abbott doesn't care. If you don't agree with Greg Abbott, he is going to force his will upon you in the state of Texas. And if you don't agree with Gavin Newsom and how they're going — he's going to force his will upon you," he added.

FORMER DEMOCRATIC ADVISOR SAYS PARTY'S RHETORIC ON REDISTRICTING IS GETTING 'A LITTLE OUT OF CONTROL'

The former NBC host stated that "this is not what the founders intended," placing blame on both sides of the aisle, but focusing in on Trump as the primary catalyst for what he describes as a "cold civil war."

"This is not a policy fight. This isn't the usual partisan back and forth. It is a direct stress test of whether our constitutional system actually works when a president and his party decide they don't have to care about the limits that are written down on paper," he asserted. "Trump has spent years — parts of his first term and much so far of these first 200-plus days bending and breaking the guard rails of the republic."

While Todd criticized the Trump administration's use of federal power and Texas Governor Greg Abbott's redistricting efforts, he also took issue with the Democrats' 'fight fire with fire' approach to these perceived problems.

 "The Democratic response is pretty troubling because, right now as a party, okay, as an official party apparatus, they've decided to frame this moment as a war, right? Okay, you got to fight fire with fire. This is an unprecedented moment, so they're framing this as a war," he stated. "And when you tell yourself you're in a war, you start rationalizing things you'd normally not do that you would say is immoral or wrong or unprincipled. But hey, it's war and all is fair in war, right?"

Todd noted that Democrats have championed independent commissions and wanted competitive district mapping for years, but now with Republicans "openly wanting to break the rules like they're doing in Texas," Democrats are also looking to "break the rules" with their own redistricting efforts.

"And if you criticize that decision, as I've been doing, I've been told I'm naive, that I don't understand the stakes, that you are not taking this threat seriously," he railed. "Au contraire, my friend, I do God – understand the stakes, and we are not replacing one unprincipled, unconstitutional set of leaders with another set of unprincipled, unconstitutional set of leaders."

In closing, Todd called on Republican members of Congress to "check" Trump's power and use the tools afforded to them by the Constitution to hold him accountable for the "unconstitutional" actions he has taken while in office.

"They've not lifted one finger of oversight. Not one… You couldn't even say there've been a weak check on Trump. It has been no check on him at all," he asserted. "Guess what? The Constitution can't enforce itself without people willing to wield those checks. All we have are words on yellowing parchment paper."

Surprise! It probably has nothing to do with saving birds.

The Trump administration is worried, it would seem, about eagles — like, the big birds of prey with sharp talons and famously good eyesight.

Earlier this month, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who oversees endangered species, wrote on X that wind-energy projects kill eagles, including the iconic bald eagle, and his agency would work to protect them from harm.

He even appended a memo to the post that directs the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which falls under Burgum's command, to enforce an existing law called the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act to make sure that these birds are not “sacrificed” for wind power. The law makes killing or harming eagles without a government permit illegal.

One possible interpretation is that Burgum simply cares about birds. Or the bald eagle, anyway, a national symbol.

A more obvious one is that the Trump administration continues to do everything it can to shutter or stall the build-out of US wind farms — which Trump really seems to abhor. That apparently includes suddenly caring about certain wildlife regulations.

To be clear, wind turbines are, in fact, a serious threat to birds of prey, including eagles, and to bats, especially when they're not built or operated with wildlife in mind. Accurate estimates are hard to come by, though it's reasonable to assume that turbine blades kill hundreds of eagles per year nationwide. That number is somewhere around 1 million birds per year if you account for all avian species, according to data scientist Hannah Ritchie.

That being said, a much bigger threat to birds is stray cats, buildings, and cars. Cats, alone, kill as many as 2.4 billion birds per year nationwide. Yes, billion.

And another more serious threat than turbines? Climate change — the very problem that wind energy is helping fix. A landmark 2019 report by the National Audubon Society, a nonprofit bird conservation group, found that rising temperatures put nearly two-thirds of North American bird species at an elevated risk of extinction, including golden eagles.

Finally, there's this: Although bald eagles were once on the brink of extinction, these birds are doing just fine now. Actually more than fine. Between 2009 and 2019, their population in the lower 48 states quadrupled to more than 300,000 individuals, close to historic population estimates. That doesn't include Alaska — home to the largest bald eagle population in the US — where some people consider them pests because they're so abundant.

Bald eagles don't need saving from Trump officials.

The many species that do, meanwhile, are losing protections because of policy decisions by those very same officials. So far, the Trump administration has moved to limit the scope of laws meant to safeguard migratory birds, including eagles, and all federally endangered species, seemingly to loosen restrictions on the oil and gas industry. Separately, in May, the administration took steps to undo federal protections for the lesser prairie-chicken, an imperiled ground bird in Texas that lives atop oil-rich lands. It's also planning to open up eagle-filled wilderness in Alaska to drilling, cut funding for a bird-monitoring program, and log more US forests, which are famously where birds live.

Ironically, it's the policies and programs that Trump officials are now eroding that helped save bald eagles in the first place. So if the administration was serious about helping eagles — or the hundreds of other American bird species, from hummingbirds to owls — it's pretty clear that its actions would look a lot different.

YouTube on Wednesday will begin testing a new age-verification system in the U.S. that relies on artificial intelligence to differentiate between adults and minors, based on the kinds of videos that they have been watching.

The tests initially will only affect a sliver of YouTube's audience in the U.S., but it will likely become more pervasive if the system works as well at guessing viewers' ages as it does in other parts of the world. The system will only work when viewers are logged into their accounts, and it will make its age assessments regardless of the birth date a user might have entered upon signing up.

If the system flags a logged-in viewer as being under 18, YouTube will impose the normal controls and restrictions that the site already uses as a way to prevent minors from watching videos and engaging in other behavior deemed inappropriate for that age.

The safeguards include reminders to take a break from the screen, privacy warnings and restrictions on video recommendations. YouTube, which has been owned by Google for nearly 20 years, also doesn't show ads tailored to individual tastes if a viewer is under 18. 

If the system has inaccurately called out a viewer as a minor, the mistake can be corrected by showing YouTube a government-issued identification card, a credit card or a selfie.

“YouTube was one of the first platforms to offer experiences designed specifically for young people, and we're proud to again be at the forefront of introducing technology that allows us to deliver safety protections while preserving teen privacy,” James Beser, the video service's director of product management, wrote in a blog post about the age-verification system.




People still will be able to watch YouTube videos without logging into an account, but viewing that way triggers an automatic block on some content without proof of age.

The political pressure has been building on websites to do a better job of verifying ages to shield children from inappropriate content since late June when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a Texas law aimed at preventing minors from watching pornography online.

While some services, such as YouTube, have been stepping up their efforts to verify users' ages, others have contended that the responsibility should primarily fall upon the two main smartphone app stores run by Apple and Google — a position that those two technology powerhouses have resisted.

Some digital rights groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy & Technology, have raised concerns that age verification could infringe on personal privacy and violate First Amendment protections on free speech.

A man was shot and killed in Washington, D.C. on Monday, just hours after President Donald Trump announced a federal takeover of the city's police department. 

The victim was found in the 1200 block of 12th Street NW in Washington, D.C.'s Logan Circle neighborhood around 7 p.m., a Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital. 

"Upon arrival, officers located an adult male, unconscious and not breathing, suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. DC Fire and EMS responded and transported the victim to a local hospital, where despite all lifesaving efforts the victim was pronounced dead," the spokesperson added. "Homicide Detectives are investigating."

On Monday, Trump said he would federalize the police department and place it under the authority of U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in an effort to address crime. He also said he was activating approximately 800 National Guard troops to "reestablish law, order and public safety" in the capital.

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called the move "unsettling and unprecedented." 

"While this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can't say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we're totally surprised," Bowser said during a news conference. "I can say to D.C. residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes you proud."

The District of Columbia Home Rule Act allows Trump to place the city's police department under federal control for up to 30 days. 

The Washington, D.C. City Council called the temporary takeover a "manufactured intrusion on local authority." 

"Violent crime in the District is at the lowest rates we've seen in 30 years. Federalizing the Metropolitan Police Department is unwarranted because there is no Federal emergency," the council said in a joint statement. "Further, the National Guard has no public safety training or knowledge of local laws. The Guard's role does not include investigating or solving crimes in the District. Calling out the National Guard is an unnecessary deployment with no real mission."

Former NBA star Sebastian Telfair expressed hope that President Donald Trump would pardon him as he's set to report to prison on Tuesday for violating the terms of his release.

Telfair was among the former NBA players caught up in a healthcare fraud scandal. He was given a suspended sentence for his role in the fraud.

However, Sportico reported in June that Telfair failed to live up to the terms of his conditional supervised release. He didn't live up to his court-ordered community service and didn't report to the U.S. Probation Office and is now set to spend six months in prison over it.

He told TMZ Sports this week that the situation was "definitely some bulls---."

"Trump, go check in on my story, and you're definitely going to want to pardon me. You'll hold me accountable and want me to continue to go do good. But I did too good to being sending anybody to jail," he told TMZ Sports.

Telfair claimed the whole issue stemmed from a problem with paperwork and that it was "super unfair."

He said if Trump doesn't come through for him then he will be in jail trying to improve himself.

Telfair was among 18 former NBA players who were charged in October 2021 with pocketing about $2.5 million by defrauding the NBA's health and welfare benefit plan with a scam that involved fake medical and dental expenses.

NBA champion Glen "Big Baby" Davis was given a 40-month sentence in May 2024.

Telfair reached a plea deal in the case, with prosecutors recommending that he serve between 15 and 21 months, according to Sportico. He was sentenced to time served and three years of a supervised release program.

Fox News contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss a breakthrough blood test to diagnose Alzheimer's and the rise in whooping cough cases seen in Hawaii. 

Many assume that memory loss and cognitive decline are an inevitable part of aging — but new research suggests that doesn't have to be the case.

A 25-year study from Northwestern University analyzed the brains of "super agers" to determine what traits they share that may contribute to their mental resilience.

"Super agers" are defined as people 80 and older who show "outstanding memory performance" that is on par with those who are three decades younger, according to the researchers.

'MISSING LINK' TO ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE FOUND IN STUDY OF HUMAN BRAIN TISSUE

"‘Super ager' is not a condition, but rather a term we defined at Northwestern on the basis of a score on a memory test over age 80," lead author Sandra Weintraub, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and neurology at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told Fox News Digital.

"We were interested in memory aging because memory decline is the most common complaint in older adults. One can be ‘super' in many ways, and this is just one."

"Super agers" are defined as people 80 and older who show "outstanding memory performance" that is on par with those who are three decades younger. (iStock)

In the study, the researchers analyzed 79 brains that were donated by super agers and identified some key differences compared to those who "age typically."

Some of the brains contained amyloid and tau proteins, which typically accumulate in people with Alzheimer's disease, while other brains showed no sign of these toxins.

ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCHERS SAY TARGETING BRAIN SUGAR COULD HELP PROTECT AGAINST DEMENTIA

"Some super agers have very few of these proteins, so for some reason they don't manufacture them," Weintraub noted. "But we found some super agers' brains contained large numbers of these proteins, despite maintaining their cognitive health until death."

This means there may be different biological pathways to super aging — "one resistance and the other resilience," she said.

"If your relative is forgetful at age 80, it may not be part of aging, but of disease."

With the resistance group, they don't make the plaques and tangles, Weintraub said. In the resilience group, they make them, but they don't have any impact on their brains.

While "typically aging" brains show thinning of the cortex — which is the outer layer of the brain that helps with decision-making, motivation and regulation of emotions — the super agers' brains did not show this characteristic.

TWO CANCER DRUGS SHOW PROMISE IN REVERSING ALZHEIMER'S DEVASTATING EFFECTS

Super agers were also found to have a greater number of "von economo neurons," which are brain cells that control social behavior. The researchers also found that this group had larger "entorhinal neurons," which are essential for powering memory, the release stated.

In terms of behavior, the super agers were also found to be "highly social" with strong interpersonal relationships, according to the study findings.

"There is the common assumption that aging implicitly brings cognitive decline and that loss of short-term memory is part of ‘normal aging,'" lead author Sandra Weintraub, professor of psychiatry and neurology at Northwestern Medicine, told Fox News Digital.

ALZHEIMER'S RISK COULD RISE WITH SPECIFIC SLEEP PATTERN, EXPERTS WARN

"The truth is that on average, cognitive test scores decline, but the variance among individuals within that average span gets larger and larger with age," she continued.

"That means that loss is not inevitable, and that if your relative is forgetful at age 80, it may not be part of aging, but of disease."

Christopher Weber, Ph.D., senior director of global science initiatives at the Alzheimer's Association in Chicago, was not involved in the study but commented on the "exciting" findings.

"This increases our understanding of people's brains as they age and gives some insight into what makes some resilient or resistant to age-related brain changes," Weber told Fox News Digital.

The study shows that super agers have "more preserved brain structure" that is similar to much younger adults, according to Weber. 

"The findings suggest that cognitive decline is not an inevitable part of aging — especially for individuals who have more protective factors that preserve brain health and cognition," he said.

Weber pointed out, however, that the "super aging" study population is small and not representative of the real-world population.

"They are primarily well-educated and White," he said. "Also, this group was self-selected into the study. These individuals may be more health-conscious or cognitively engaged than average older adults."

Even so, the findings could help scientists create more — and better — strategies for treating and preventing cognitive decline, according to Weber.

"The more we know about successful aging, the more opportunities we have to discover and create interventions to enhance resistance and resilience."

To help reduce the risk factors that affect brain health, Weintraub said, "What is good for your heart is good for your brain."

"What is good for your heart is good for your brain."

"We know that adopting certain lifestyle changes will reduce the risk of a bad outcome, but are not guaranteed to eradicate it," she told Fox News Digital.  

"Having said that, eat well, sleep well, exercise, socialize and value social relationships, treat whatever condition you have that you can treat, and stay away from harmful substances."

The study was supported by the Northwestern Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health.

The findings were published in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association.

President Donald Trump nominated Heritage Foundation economist E.J. Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

His nomination comes shortly after Trump fired former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, a Biden appointee who published an unfavorable job report. He included an implicit slight against McEntarfer in his announcement on Truth Social.

“I am pleased to announce that I am nominating Highly Respected Economist, Dr. E.J. Antoni, as the next Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our Economy is booming, and E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE,” the president said. “I know E.J. Antoni will do an incredible job in this new role. Congratulations E.J.!”

The BLS's July jobs report revealed that some 258,000 fewer jobs were added in May and June than previously reported, meaning the three-month moving average of job gains was just 35,000 in July, below the level needed to keep pace with population growth. Trump claimed the numbers were “rigged” and accused McEntarfer of inflating the job numbers of former President Joe Biden before the November election.

Trump's move drew widespread criticism, but Antoni was a vocal defender. Speaking with the Washington Examiner on Aug. 5, he said he was only surprised that such a move had taken so long.“Just the timing is very unfortunate because it makes it look like you're just firing the person because you weren't happy with the numbers as opposed to firing for incompetence, which I think has been the case for a couple of years now,” Antoni said.

Though he disagreed with Trump's allegation of “shenanigans,” Antoni said he did believe previous job reports were faulty due to “general incompetence.” Antoni pointed to the low survey response as illustrating McEntarfer's poor performance in the role.

FACT CHECK: TRUMP'S CLAIM THAT PRE-ELECTION JOBS REVISIONS HELPED DEMOCRATS

He provided some hints about how he'll run the BLS if he passes confirmation, but he said he didn't like how the agency still carries out phone surveys.

Antoni was previously critical of the BLS and contributed to the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025.

The Trump administration is still working out the details of its 15% export tax on Nvidia and AMD and could bring deals of this kind to more companies, the White House's Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.

"Right now it stands with these two companies. Perhaps it could expand in the future to other companies," said Leavitt, the White House's spokesperson. 

"The legality of it, the mechanics of it, is still being ironed out by the Department of Commerce, and I would defer you to them for any further details on how it will actually be implemented," she continued.

President Donald Trump confirmed on Monday that he had negotiated a deal with Nvidia in which the U.S. government approves export licenses for the China-specific H20 AI chip in exchange for a 15% cut of revenue. Advanced Micro Devices also got licenses approved in exchange for a proportion of its China sales, the White House confirmed.

"I said, 'If I'm going to do that, I want you to pay us as a country something, because I'm giving you a release,'" Trump said Monday.

"We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets," Nvidia said in a statement this week.

Trump said the export licenses for AMD and Nvidia were a done deal. But lawyers and experts who follow trade have warned that Trump's deal may be complicated because of existing laws that regulate how the government can charge fees for export licenses.

The Commerce Department didn't immediately return a request for comment.

The H20 is Nvidia's Chinese-specific chip that is slowed down on purpose to comply with U.S. export relations. It's related to the H100 and H200 chips that are used in the U.S., and was introduced after the Biden administration implemented export controls on artificial intelligence chips in 2023.

Earlier this year, Nvidia said that it was on track to sell more than $8 billion worth of H20 chips in a single quarter before the Trump administration in April said that it would require a license to export the chip.

Trump signaled in July that he was likely to approve export licenses for the chip after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang visited the White House.

The U.S. regulates AI chips like those made by Nvidia for national security reasons, saying that they could be used by the Chinese government to leapfrog U.S. capabilities in AI, or they could be used by the Chinese military or linked groups.

The Chinese government has been encouraging local companies in recent weeks to avoid using Nvidia's H20 chips for any government or national security-related work, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.

In this article

There's a new company at the center of the intensifying battle between Elon Musk and Sam Altman: Apple.

Musk and Altman, who helped start OpenAI a decade ago with a group of other co-founders, had a public falling out that led to a legal fight last year, with Musk accusing Altman of breach of contract for abandoning the artificial intelligence company's founding mission.

The back-and-forth war of words and lawsuits took another dramatic turn on Monday, when Musk threatened Apple with "immediate" legal action over alleged antitrust violations. Musk's complaint, which he voiced on his social media site X, is that Apple favors OpenAI's ChatGPT over X's Grok chatbot in the App Store.

"Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation," Musk wrote, without citing evidence. "xAI will take immediate legal action."

Apple partnered with OpenAI in mid-2024 to integrate ChatGPT into its iPhone, iPad, Mac laptop and desktop products. Readers added context to Musk's post, pointing out that China's DeepSeek reached the top spot in the App Store in January of this year, and that Perplexity was No. 1 in India in July.

Altman quickly responded to Musk's accusations.

"This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like," Altman wrote in a post on X Monday night.

Altman referenced a 2023 report from tech news site Platformer that described how Musk, after acquiring Twitter (now X), made sweeping platform changes and "created a special system for showing you all his tweets first."

Altman said that if Musk ended up filing a suit, he hoped it would lead to "counter-discovery on this," adding that he and many others "would love to know what's been happening."

The feud continued into the morning hours on Tuesday.

"You got 3M views on your bulls--- post, you liar, far more than I've received on many of mine, despite me having 50 times your follower count!" Musk wrote.

Musk's X account indicates he has 224 million followers, but the company has never disclosed how many could be bots. Altman's account on X lists 3.9 million followers.

Altman clapped back, asking if Musk would "sign an affidavit that you have never directed changes to the X algorithm in a way that has hurt your competitors" or helped his own companies, and said he would offer a personal apology in return.

Neither Musk nor his attorneys responded to requests for comment. OpenAI referred CNBC to Altman's posts and the company's past statements. Apple declined to comment.

Musk stepped down from the OpenAI board in 2018, after hiring another founding member of the startup, Andrej Karpathy, to run the Autopilot team at Tesla. Around the time he left OpenAI, Musk said he saw AI as "potentially more dangerous than nukes."

As part of his lawsuit against OpenAI, Musk asked a federal court to stop the AI startup from converting into a fully for-profit business. Musk argued that OpenAI ditched its original mission as a nonprofit to develop AI "for the benefit of humanity broadly." A federal judge in California denied Musk's effort to halt the transformation.

OpenAI has emerged as a massive commercial enterprise since the public launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, and is now in talks with investors about a stock sale that would value the company at roughly $500 billion, CNBC confirmed last week.

Musk formed xAI in March 2023, announcing its debut four months later. Since then, he has raised billions of dollars for the company, merged it with X and called for Tesla, his only publicly traded business, to invest billions more into the AI company.

In February, a Musk-led group of investors offered to buy control of OpenAI for $97.4 billion. Altman responded on X, saying, "no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want."

In dragging Apple into the dispute, Musk has focused on the App Store, where ChatGPT is currently the top-ranked free app while Grok is fifth. Musk took issue with ChatGPT being listed as one of the store's "Must-Have Apps," a list that does not include Grok.

"Why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your 'Must Have' section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps? Are you playing politics?" Musk wrote in a post.

Grok releases have been riddled with safety issues and concerns surrounding manipulation of the technology. In May, the chatbot promoted false claims about alleged "white genocide" in South Africa, leading Musk to write that the automatic responses were the result of an "unauthorized modification." In July, Grok responses across X included praise for Adolf Hitler.

Musk's threats to Apple come as the iPhone maker faces pressure from regulators and competitors over App Store policies. A panel of judges in June denied Apple's emergency application to halt changes to its App Store that resulted from the company's legal battle with Epic Games. In 2021, a judge ruled that Apple could no longer prohibit developers from directing users away from the company's in-app purchasing, which brings with it up to 30% of gross sales.

Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has made an unsolicited $34.5 billion bid for Google's Chrome browser, CNBC confirmed on Tuesday.

That figure is higher than Perplexity's current valuation, but the company said several investors have agreed to back the deal. In July, Perplexity was valued at $18 billion as part of an extension that valued the company at $14 billion months earlier.

Google did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. The Wall Street Journal was first to report the bid.

Perplexity is best known for its AI-powered search engine that gives users simple answers to questions and links out to the original source material on the web. Last month, it launched its own AI-powered browser called Comet.

The startup is in the middle of a battle for supremacy in generative AI, with companies including Meta and OpenAI offering massive salaries and signing bonuses to top engineers. Megacap tech companies are spending tens of billions of dollars a year on AI infrastructure to build large language models and run hefty workloads, while startups are raising billions of dollars from venture investors, hedge funds and tech giants to pay for the hardware and headcount needed to compete.

Perplexity was approached by Meta earlier this year about a potential acquisition, but the companies did not finalize a deal.

Perpexity's bid comes after the U.S. Department of Justice proposed Google divest Chrome as part of the antitrust suit the company lost last year. The judge in the case ruled that Google has held an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search.

In response, Google said the DOJ was pushing "a radical interventionist agenda," and that the agency's proposal was "wildly overbroad." The company has not yet disclosed how it plans to adjust its business following the antitrust ruling.

Chrome, which Google launched in 2008, provides the search giant with data it then uses for targeting ads. The DOJ said in a filing following the court's decision that forcing the company to get rid of Chrome would create a more equal playing field for search competitors.

"To remedy these harms, the [Initial Proposed Final Judgment] requires Google to divest Chrome, which will permanently stop Google's control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet," the DOJ wrote.

Perplexity's bid for Chrome is not the first time it's taken a big swing.

The startup submitted a proposal to merge with the short-form video app TikTok in January. TikTok's future in the U.S. has been uncertain since 2024, when Congress passed a bill that would ban the platform unless its Chinese owner, ByteDance, divested from it.

As of August, Perplexity's proposed structure has not materialized.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to allow a "major lawsuit" against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to proceed, escalating his pressure on the central bank leader to cut interest rates.

Trump said in a Truth Social post that the suit would relate to Powell's management of pricey renovations at the Fed's headquarters in Washington, D.C., which the president has previously criticized.

Trump did not say when that suit could be filed or by whom.

"Jerome 'Too Late' Powell must NOW lower the rate," Trump wrote in the post.

"Steve 'Manouychin' really gave me a 'beauty'when he pushed this loser," Trump wrote, referring to his first-term Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin having encouraged him to nominate Powell as Fed chair in 2017.

"The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable. Fortunately, the economy is sooo good that we've blown through Powell and the complacent Board," Trump claimed.

"I am, though, considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed because of the horrible, and grossly incompetent, job he has done in managing the construction of the Fed Buildings."

"Three Billion Dollars for a job that should have been a $50 Million Dollar fix up. Not good!" he wrote.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the president's post.

The Fed declined to comment on Trump's post.

Powell and the Fed have previously defended the ongoing renovations of two historic buildings in D.C., which house the central bank, and explained why costs have risen during the projects.

Powell pushed back on Trump to his face last month when the president visited the construction site and claimed that renovation costs had topped $3.1 billion.

"I haven't heard that from anybody," Powell said then.

Trump has railed against Powell for months as he pressured the central bank to quickly slash interest rates by multiple percentage points.

Trump claims that doing so would save the United States vast sums of money by reducing the cost of borrowing to finance government operations.

After raising the benchmark federal funds rate in 2022 in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Fed gradually cut interest rates multiple times in 2024, the final full year of President Joe Biden's term in office.

But it has kept rates steady throughout 2025 so far, defying Trump's demands.

In congressional testimony in July, Powell said the Fed would have already cut rates this year if Trump had not implemented his major tariff policy.

Fed officials in June indicated they expect two rate cuts this year.

Traders currently anticipate a quarter-point rate reduction following the Federal Open Market Committee's September meeting. Expectations have risen for further cuts after FOMC meetings in October and December.

Anthropic on Tuesday announced it will offer Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government to all three branches of the U.S. government for $1 per agency for a year.

It's the latest example of how major artificial intelligence companies have been looking to deepen their ties to policymakers and regulators in recent months.

Anthropic's competitor OpenAI announced earlier this month it will give its ChatGPT Enterprise product to U.S. federal agencies for $1 through the next year.

Anthropic said it partnered with the U.S. General Services Administration to bring its technology to participating agencies in the executive, legislative and judicial branches. The company is also offering technical support to help agencies implement its AI.

"America's AI leadership requires that our government institutions have access to the most capable, secure AI tools available," Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a statement.

Competition for U.S. government customers has grown fierce.

In June, Anthropic released a set of Claude Gov models that were built exclusively for U.S. national security customers.

The following month, the U.S. Department of Defense announced contract awards of up to $200 million for AI development at Anthropic, Google, OpenAI and Elon Musk's xAI. That same day, xAI announced Grok for Government, which is a suite of products that make the company's models available to U.S. government customers.

OpenAI is planning to open its first office in Washington, D.C., early next year, and it launched a new offering called OpenAI for Government in June.

Tesla is recruiting test drivers in New York to operate cars with "automated driving systems," but the company hasn't applied for the permits it would need to test autonomous vehicles in the nation's largest city.

A job opening on Tesla's website says the company is looking to hire vehicle operators in the borough of Queens. The hires will be "responsible for driving an engineering vehicle for extended periods, conducting dynamic audio and camera data collection for testing and training purposes."

A spokesperson for the New York City Department of Transportation told CNBC on Monday that Tesla has not applied for approvals to test AVs on city streets in New York. InsideEVs, an electric vehicles news site, previously reported that Tesla was hiring test drivers for its robotaxis in Brooklyn.

Any company that obtains a permit to test AVs in New York has to keep "a trained safety driver behind the wheel, ready to take control of an AV-enabled vehicle at all times," according to the DOT spokesperson.

Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.

Alphabet's Waymo, the robotaxi leader in North America, has applied to test its AVs in New York, but its application remains under review, the DOT said Monday.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been trying to sell investors on a future for his company that's built around AI and robotics, rather than sales of its existing vehicles. But Tesla still earns almost all of its revenue from sales of EVs and battery energy storage systems.

Tesla's EV sales have been on the decline this year, especially in Europe, partly due to Musk's decision to focus on the Cybertruck, rather than producing a more affordable EV with mainstream appeal. Some of the company's struggles are the result of a political backlash against Tesla because of Musk's incendiary political rhetoric, work with President Donald Trump, and endorsements of Germany's anti-immigrant AfD party.

Along with its recruiting efforts in Queens, Tesla is also seeking to hire test drivers for its Autopilot team to gather data from drives in cities and suburbs of Dallas, Houston, Tampa, Orlando and Miami, as well as Palo Alto, California, home to Tesla's engineering headquarters.

The current listings on Tesla's website say Autopilot vehicle operators may need to travel to international and domestic destinations and must be familiar with "automated driving systems," suggesting planned or ongoing testing of Tesla's robotaxi and FSD or Full Self Driving system, currently marketed as FSD Unsupervised in the U.S.

Tesla notched a win in Texas last week, obtaining a permit to run a ride-hailing service in the state. The Tesla Robotaxi LLC permit and state regulations do not require Tesla to keep a human safety driver on board.

However, Tesla has been operating a fleet of robotaxis in Austin since late June, with employees riding in the front passenger seat, tasked with manually intervening during a trip if necessary. The service has only been accessible to invited users. Musk said in a post on X over the weekend that he intends for the Austin service to open to the general public next month.

In San Francisco, Tesla is also operating a limited, manned car service but promoting it as "autonomous ride-hailing." 

Musk posted last week that the company is "working as quickly as possible to get 100+ Teslas operating for autonomous ride-hailing (can't use the word "taxi" or "cab" in California) in the Bay Area and allow anyone to request a ride."

The company is not authorized to carry passengers on public roads in autonomous vehicles in California, the California Public Utilities Commission told CNBC in a recent email.

Tesla's approach to AVs has drawn federal probes, product liability lawsuits and recalls following injurious or damaging collisions that occurred while drivers were using the company's Autopilot or FSD systems.

The California DMV previously sued Tesla, accusing it of false advertising around its driver assistance systems.

While Tesla owners manuals say the Autopilot and FSD features in their cars are "hands on" systems that require a driver ready to steer or brake at any time, Tesla and Musk have shared statements through the years saying that a Tesla can "drive itself."

Russian President Vladimir Putin is not actually interested in negotiating when he meets his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump to discuss the war in Ukraine, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told CNBC on Tuesday.

European officials and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have expressed concerns at being sidelined from the Putin-Trump meeting in Alaska on Friday. The Ukrainian leader warned that Russia is planning further offensives and cannot be trusted, while European leaders have been scrambling to secure Ukraine a seat at the table.

"In order to have any deal implemented, you need Europe and you need Ukraine. So it is clear that Putin is just pretending to negotiate," Kallas said on CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe."

"Putin doesn't want Zelenskyy around that table, because that would reveal that he actually doesn't want to negotiate, and he just wants to have a picture with President Trump and also postpone sanctions," she said. CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for a response to Kallas' claims and is awaiting a response.

European officials and Zelenskyy have been sidelined from the Putin-Trump meeting in Alaska on Friday, which has caused much irritation. Zelenskyy has warned that Russia is planning further offensives and cannot be trusted, while European leaders have been scrambling to try and influence Trump and get Ukraine a seat at the table.

European leaders, including Zelenskyy, are set to meet for a virtual summit later on Tuesday, which will reportedly focus on ways to pressure Russia, the fate of Ukrainian territories seized by Russia and possible security guarantees for Kyiv. Trump has also been invited.

U.S. has threatened, but not yet implemented sanctions on Russia. European officials have long been trying to pressure Washington D.C. to implement measures, which could put pressure on Putin.

Ahead of the talks between Trump and Putin, concerns have also grown that the U.S. president may pursue a solution that would be unfavourable for Ukraine.

Trump suggested on Monday that there could "some swapping" of territory as part of a peace deal though he insisted the U.S. "would try to get some of that territory back for Ukraine."

The EU's Kallas on Tuesday said no deal could be implemented behind Ukraine's back. When asked about how the EU could react should Trump agree to cede some Ukrainian territory to Russia, she said: "How would that work in practice, like really, if Ukraine doesn't agree to this, then how would it really work?"

Putin clearly just wants concessions, she said, adding that before any talks about ceding territory, a ceasefire should be discussed.

"Just to recall that Ukraine agreed to unconditional ceasefire already five months ago, and since then, Putin and Kremlin, Russia has just been playing games," Kallas said.

"Russia could stop this war today. Just stop bombing the civilians and civilian infrastructure, and the war would be over," she added.

The EU diplomat also addressed tensions within the bloc regarding its approach to the war.

Hungary, which has previously created hurdles for the approval of EU sanctions against Russia, this week chose not to endorse a statement by the bloc that said Ukraine must be free to decide its own future.

"We definitely also need to discuss our working methods, because this is a crucial time for Europe, it is a crucial time for our security, and we need to be able to adopt decisions. We have been able to adopt decisions so far, but it's of course, increasingly more difficult," Kallas said.

Spirit Airlines has warned it might not be able to survive as a going concern if it doesn't raise more cash, five months after the budget travel icon emerged from bankruptcy.

After cutting its debt during restructuring, Spirit has tried to attract bookings by marketing more upscale products and looking for new ways to lower costs. Late last month, the airline announced plans to furlough 270 more pilots this fall.

"However, the Company has continued to be affected by adverse market conditions, including elevated domestic capacity and continued weak demand for domestic leisure travel in the second quarter of 2025, resulting in a challenging pricing environment," the company said in its quarterly report late Monday.

As its financial results aren't improving at the same pace creditors agreements require, Spirit will need additional cash. Failing to do so could result in defaults. The carrier is looking at selling some aircraft, real estate or airport gates, it said.

"Because of the uncertainty of successfully completing the initiatives to comply with the minimum liquidity covenants and of the outcome of discussions with Company stakeholders, management has concluded there is substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months from the date these financial statements are issued," it said in the filing.

Spirit's bankruptcy last year marked the first for a major U.S. airline since 2011.

Known for its bright yellow planes, Spirit was a budget airline pioneer in the U.S., but struggled in the wake of a failed acquisition by JetBlue Airways last year, shifting consumer tastes to more upmarket products and an engine recall that grounded many of its airplanes.

U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled that he'd be open to allowing Nvidia to sell a downgraded version of its most advanced artificial intelligence chip to China.

Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Trump said that he could make a deal with Nvidia if it could reduce the performance of its Blackwell system.

"It's possible I'd make a deal" on a "somewhat enhanced — in a negative way — Blackwell" processor, Trump said. "In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it."

Trump indicated that he will meet with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang regarding the Blackwell.

"On the Blackwell, I think he [Huang] is coming to see me again about that," Trump said, adding that the Blackwell system is the "latest and the greatest in the world."

Last month, Huang, who has lobbied Trump for access to the Chinese market after effectively being shut out, said he hopes to sell more advanced chips to China.

The flurry of activity around semiconductors comes after Nvidia and AMD agreed to a deal to pay the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. Trump said he initially asked for a 20% cut but that the number came down to 15% after Huang negotiated.

If the downgraded Blackwell chips were approved for export, it "would be a big deal going forward," said Paul Triolo, partner and senior vice president for China at advisory firm DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group.

"The idea here is to addict China to substandard, or non-cutting edge technology, Triolo added.

Nvidia's Huang has often touted the idea that if China is cut off from American chips then domestic tech firms like Huawei will fill the void. He has argued that U.S. chips should be sold in China so that Chinese firms are dependent on them when developing their AI technology.

Washington's chip export regime has evolved over the past few years. Nvidia was blocked in 2022 from exporting its A100 and H100 chips to China — chips that are crucial for training large AI models. In 2023, the U.S. placed additional export curbs on more Nvidia semiconductors.

Chinese firms stockpiled these chips and have been using them to build their AI models. These chips were acquired legally and are still being used to train models, according to Triolo.

It's not yet clear what kind of capabilities a downgraded Blackwell system for China would have and if it would be suitable for training more advanced models. In the meantime, Huawei is continuing to develop its Ascend series of processors, which it is trying to position as an Nvidia alternative.

"We are in sort of a transition point of running out of those stockpiles of earlier acquired Nvidia GPUs and hoping that Huawei's new Ascend series of processors will be capable of replacing those but they are not quite capable of doing that yet," Triolo said.

"Probably next year Huawei will have a new version of its 910 processors that will be more competitive with Nvidia."

On sales rose 32% in the Swiss sportswear company's second quarter, leading it to raise its full-year revenue guidance even as it contends with new tariffs on imports from Vietnam. 

The buzzy sneaker brand, which has been credited with taking market share from Nike, now expects full-year sales of 2.91 billion Swiss francs ($3.58 billion), up from its previous outlook of 2.86 billion francs. That's in line with Wall Street expectations of 2.92 billion francs, according to LSEG. 

On also raised its gross margin guidance to a range of 60.5% to 61%, compared with its previous outlook of between 60% and 60.5%. 

The company's shares jumped 7% in morning trading Tuesday.

On, which sources about 90% of its goods from Vietnam, raised prices on July 1 to offset the higher costs. It hasn't seen demand slow down among wholesale partners or consumers, CEO Martin Hoffmann told CNBC in an interview. 

"We have a lot of confidence in our lifestyle business, so we skewed the price increases more towards the lifestyle business, while trying to stay a bit more where we were on our running products," Hoffmann said. "So far, we don't see negative impact from the price increases." 

The company, which has grown more than 30% in nearly every quarter since 2023, beat Wall Street's sales expectations for the second quarter. 

Here's how On did in its second quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

On's net loss in the three months ended June 30 was 40.9 million francs or 12 cents per share, compared with net income of 30.8 million francs, or 10 cents per share, in the year-ago period. The loss was primarily driven by foreign exchange fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc.

Sales rose to 749 million francs, up 32% from 568 million francs a year earlier.

On, founded in Switzerland in 2010, has sought to become the most premium sportswear brand on the market. It is one of several companies that have been taking share from Nike, most notably in its running segment. The company draws a fraction of Nike's annual sales, but it has garnered a reputation for innovation, a recent knock against the legacy sneaker giant. 

In a sneaker category that's been relatively soft in recent years, On has consistently grown sales in the mid-double digits and still has more room to grow given how low its brand awareness is in some parts of the world. 

One key to the strategy has been balancing direct sales through its own website and stores and sales through wholesale. At a time when Nike pulled away from wholesalers, On and others filled that crucial shelf space while growing their store footprint and digital revenue. 

During the second quarter, On's wholesale and direct-to-consumer revenue both exceeded Wall Street expectations. On's wholesale revenue was 441 million francs, compared with estimates of 429 million francs, according to StreetAccount. Direct sales were 308 million francs, compared with expectations of 279 million francs, according to StreetAccount. 

Sales in the Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and the Asia-Pacific region all beat expectations, according to StreetAccount. 

While On doesn't break out its performance in China, Hoffmann said it's been a bright spot for the company, as sales grew about 50% in the second quarter compared with the year-ago period. 

"The American and the Chinese consumer is very strong for On," said Hoffmann. "We have seen basically 50% same-store growth in our retail stores, even bigger growth in our [e-commerce] channel, and then the new stores come on top so … China is a very strong market for us."

Elon Musk has a bone to pick with Apple.

In a series of tweets late Monday night, Musk said xAI would take legal action against Apple for what he says is its bias toward OpenAI on the App Store.

"Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation," Musk wrote in an X post. "xAI will take immediate legal action."

In a post earlier on Monday, he asked why the App Store hadn't placed X higher in its rankings. Musk said X deserved the spot because it is "the #1 news app in the world."

"Are you playing politics? What gives? Inquiring minds want to know," Musk wrote.

xAI and Apple didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

At press time, OpenAI's ChatGPT is ranked first on the App Store. Grok is ranked fifth.

"Unfortunately, what choice do we have? Apple didn't just put their thumb on the scale, they put their whole body!" Musk wrote on X on Monday.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Musk's threats on Monday.

"This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like," Altman wrote on X.

Altman said the ChatGPT maker would remain "focused on making great products."

But Musk was not done.

"Apple behaves like it's owned by OpenAI — why?" Musk wrote on X on Tuesday morning. He was responding to a post containing several screenshots of banners from the App Store featuring ChatGPT.

Musk and Altman cofounded OpenAI in 2015. Musk left its board in 2018. Since then, Musk has become a vocal critic of Altman's leadership of OpenAI.

In February 2024, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, accusing it of violating its nonprofit mission when it partnered with Microsoft. He withdrew the lawsuit in June 2024, only to refile it two months later.

Musk has previously leveled criticism at Apple and the App Store. In May 2022, Musk slammed the 30% fee Apple takes from sales on the App Store. Musk said Apple's fee was a "tax on the Internet" and "literally 10 times higher than it should be."

After acquiring Twitter in October 2022, Musk accused Apple of censorship and monopolistic practices.

"Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. Do they hate free speech in America?" Musk wrote on X on November 28, 2022.

"Apple has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won't tell us why," he wrote in a follow-up post, amid concerns that Musk's loosening of Twitter's content moderation policies could run afoul of Apple's content restrictions.

The dispute was resolved after Musk met with Apple CEO Tim Cook. Musk said in an X post on November 30, 2022, that he had a "good conversation" with Cook and that they had "resolved the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store."

"Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so," Musk said.

Sidelined from forthcoming talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end to the war, Ukraine has warned the world that Moscow is not to be trusted and is planning new offensives.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said intelligence and military officials had briefed him on Monday "on what Putin is counting on and what he is actually preparing for," saying "this includes military preparations."

"He is certainly not preparing to cease fire or end the war," Zelenskyy said in his nightly address.

"There is not a single sign that the Russians have been told to prepare for a post-war situation – not yet. On the contrary, they are moving their troops and forces in ways that indicate they plan to launch new offensive operations. No one preparing for peace acts this way," he added.

"Putin's sole aim is to present a meeting with America as his personal victory and then continue acting as before, putting pressure on Ukraine as before," the president warned. CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for a response to Zelenskyy's claims and is awaiting a response.

The problem for Ukraine is whether anyone is listening.

Neither Zelenskyy nor European officials are invited to the Trump-Putin talks in Alaska on Friday, much to their consternation.

Ukraine has vehemently stated that no deal about its future can be struck in its absence, amid fears that it could be forced to cede Russian-occupied territory to Moscow as part of a peace deal. European leaders, meanwhile, are pushing strongly for Ukraine's involvement in the talks. The U.S., for its part, has said it is considering inviting Zelenskyy, NBC News reported.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz invited Trump to join Zelenskyy and European leaders when they hold an emergency call on Tuesday afternoon in anticipation of Friday's talks. The virtual summit will reportedly focus on ways to pressure Russia, the fate of Ukrainian territories seized by Russia and possible security guarantees for Kyiv.

Kaja Kallas, the European Union's foreign policy chief, told CNBC Tuesday that Putin was "just pretending to negotiate" and was trying to circumvent Trump's threat of further sanctions if a ceasefire is not agreed.

"In order to have any deal implemented, you need Europe and you need Ukraine. So it is clear that Putin is just pretending to negotiate. Otherwise it would have Ukraine around that table. He just wants to postpone the sanctions, and that's why he's playing this game," Kallas told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe."

Claiming that Putin "just wants to have a picture with President Trump," Kallas said Russia had shown little appetite for peace.

"It is clear that Putin just wants some concessions, and they haven't done any concessions on their side before [talking about ceding] territories, we should talk about ceasefire ... Ukraine agreed to an unconditional ceasefire already five months ago, and since then, Putin and the Kremlin have just been playing games. So we should really put the pressure on Russia," she said.

Trump suggested on Monday that there could "some swapping" of territory as part of a peace deal though he insisted the U.S. "would try to get some of that territory back for Ukraine."

"There'll be some swapping, there'll be some changes in land," Trump told reporters at the White House, although he downplayed any expectations of what could come of the talks, describing them as a "feel-out meeting."

"We're going to see what he has in mind and if it's a fair deal, I'll reveal it to the European Union leaders and to NATO leaders and also to President Zelensky," Trump said.

Geopolitical analysts agree that the talks are unlikely to yield a comprehensive and long-lasting solution to the more-than-three year conflict between Russia and Ukraine, given the complexity of the war, its underlying causes and the number of stakeholders involved.

Instead, the talks "should be seen as the Trump administration's attempt to assess whether there is space for a mutually acceptable compromise — at least on select issues," Andrius Tursa, Central and Eastern Europe advisor at risk consultancy Teneo, said in emailed comments Monday.

"Even in a best-case scenario, any high-level agreement would require multiple rounds of difficult follow-up talks to resolve implementation issues. This would be another option for Moscow to draw out the talks, hoping to capitalize on its gradually increasing advantage on the frontlines," he noted.

The Kremlin may seek to exploit growing exhaustion in Ukraine by proposing a temporary or partial de-escalation in the war, Tursa said.

"Such a move would offer the Trump administration a symbolic diplomatic success while placing pressure on Kyiv to make substantial concessions. Should Ukraine fail to respond in a way deemed acceptable by Moscow, the Kremlin would likely portray Kyiv as the main obstacle to peace and count on Washington to increase pressure on Zelenskyy."

Tursa said this latter scenario underscores the risks inherent in any potential Trump-Putin agreement that's reached without the direct involvement of Ukraine and its European allies.

"Despite Ukraine's reliance on U.S. support, neither Zelensky nor Ukraine's parliament could be expected to endorse an agreement perceived as unfavorable and lacking public backing. Zelensky's administration has already publicly rejected the idea of territorial concessions floated ahead of the summit, clearly signaling Kyiv's red lines."

Spain's somewhat unique approach to defense and foreign policy is fueling tensions with the Trump administration.

The Spanish government recently renounced U.S. aircraft purchases and resisted intense pressure to commit to NATO's new 5% defense spending target, while seeking closer economic ties with China.

Taken together, analysts say Spain has become a rare example of a European country willing to draw the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Notably, despite Trump threatening a tough trade deal for Spain, the southern European country has not yet faced any material consequences.

"Spain is an interesting case in Europe because it is really the only country that is openly antagonizing Trump whereas everybody is trying to keep their head down for the most part," Federico Santi, a senior analyst focused on southern Europe at Eurasia Group, told CNBC by video call.

What's particular to Spain, Santi said, was the "distinct weakness" of the country's minority leftist coalition government, which has been embroiled in a series of scandals and corruption investigations.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who has led the country since 2018, has rebuffed calls from opposition lawmakers to resign. The leader of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party has instead said he intends to run for re-election in 2027.

The opportunity to focus on big-ticket foreign policy issues such as defense, Eurasia Group's Santi said, could help Sanchez to distract the public from his own domestic woes.

"Spain has, by and large, gotten away with its fairly outspoken criticism of Trump for two main reasons. Number one, it is in the EU. So, unlike the South Africa's or Brazil's of the world that faced a very direct backlash from Trump in the form of higher tariffs, they are somewhat shielded from that," Santi said.

"And the other point I think that works to Sanchez's advantage is that Trump just doesn't seem to be that concerned or aware of Spain as a country. I mean, he's aware of it, but it is not really on his radar," he added.

A spokesperson for Spain's government did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.

Spain's defense ministry said last week that it was no longer considering the option of buying U.S.-made F-35s, Reuters reported, preferring instead to replace its ageing fighter jet fleet with European military aircraft.

The decision to snub Lockheed Martin's fighter jets came after Trump said it was "terrible" that Madrid wouldn't commit to the NATO defense spending target of 5% of gross domestic product by 2035.

Speaking at a news conference at NATO's annual summit in the Netherlands in late June, Trump said the Spanish economy "could be blown right out of the water with something bad happening."

The U.S. president also threatened to make Spain pay "twice as much" on trade, criticizing Madrid for wanting to take "a little bit of a free ride" on defense.

The U.S. and EU, however, have since signed a framework trade agreement that means the 27-nation bloc will face tariffs of 15% on EU goods to the U.S. The EU negotiates trade deals collectively, which means Spain benefits from the collective bargain struck by Brussels.

In stark contrast, Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU, has been hit hard by a U.S. tariff rate of 39% on key export products.

Ignacio Molina, senior fellow at the Elcano Royal Institute, a think tank in Madrid, said Spain's geographic distance from Russia and the distinct features of its foreign policy stretching back to its last war in 1898, which was against the U.S., means that Madrid views its relationship with Washington as "less vital" than other EU countries.

"The dominant political culture in Spain is much more pro-European than Atlanticist. Even with regard to Ukraine (whom Spain strongly supports) Spain's main focus is on its EU accession bid and the reception of refugees, not on its NATO membership or arms deliveries," Molina told CNBC by email.

Molina highlighted that Spain-U.S. relations are further complicated by the fact that the Spanish government is the "most ideologically left-leaning" in all of Europe.

"This introduces a domestic political temptation to distance itself from Trump, who is extremely unpopular in Spain, including among center-right voters," Molina said.

A diplomatic rift between Spain and the U.S. has also been exacerbated by Madrid's pursuit of closer economic ties with Beijing.

The U.S. has two military bases in southern Spain, a country that has emerged as one of Europe's most China-friendly governments.

Both U.S. and EU officials have recently been critical of Sanchez's decision to award a multi-million-euro contract to Chinese tech giant Huawei for the use of its wiretapping technology.

Kristina Kausch, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the U.S., and the think tank's representative in Madrid, said Spain's deepening ties with China had raised eyebrows in the U.S. and parts of Europe.

"While this echoes a broader desire in Europe for strategic rebalancing, EU leaders have stressed that such a rebalancing must be based in reciprocity," Kausch said.

By resisting U.S. purchasing pressure on defense, Kausch told CNBC that Spain has demonstrated Europe's determination to independently develop military capabilities and industrial capacity.

Even with the cover of EU membership, however, Kausch said the approach is not likely to be risk-free.

"Spain is giving a voice to concerns that are also shared, to greater or lesser degree, by other EU or NATO allies. It shows leadership, but it is also a big gamble that could backfire on Sanchez personally, on Spain, and on Europe," she added.

The Ukrainian firm Wild Hornets said its Sting interceptor reached up to 195 miles per hour in stable flight — a speed that likely makes the system one of the fastest first-person-view combat drones.

The startup released a video on Monday of the Sting flying over open fields in an apparent test. A speed counter on the drone's first-person-view user interface indicated that the Sting reached up to 315 kilometers per hour, or roughly the top velocity of a standard bullet train.

Business Insider couldn't independently verify the drone's speed.

The announcement comes as the Ukrainian drone industry has been trying for months to push the limits of its FPV interceptors.

Ukrainian units are increasingly looking to these low-cost drones, once a novel concept on the battlefield, as a solution against the Iranian-designed Shahed.

Russia, which manufactures the Shahed locally, has drastically increased the number of these exploding drones it deploys at a time, pairing them with ballistic missiles to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses.

New Russian tactics that allow Shaheds to fly higher and faster have also made it more difficult for machine gun squads, a core pillar of air defense for Ukraine, to hit the loitering munitions reliably.

An interceptor drone's speed is key because the uncrewed system must be fast enough to catch up to the Shahed. The Shahed-136, the standard loitering munition used in Russia's drone waves, flies at about 115 miles per hour.

When reports first emerged of the Sting's existence in the fall of 2024, the drone's baseline was to fly faster than 100 miles per hour.

With Monday's video announcement, it has now been recorded notching nearly double that speed.

One of the industry's rising stars, the Sting is being deployed in active combat, though it's unclear at what scale.

The Wild Hornets have said that one interceptor costs $2,500 and that Ukrainian pilots have already used the Sting to destroy roughly 100 Shahed drones.

That's still a small contribution against the total volume of Moscow's drone attacks; Russia launched more than 6,000 Shaheds and decoys in July alone.

But Ukraine hopes interceptor drones will soon shore up the gap in its air defenses. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced a goal for the country to build 1,000 interceptor drones daily.

Kyiv's forces generally report shooting down or disabling between 86 to 89% of Russia's Shaheds, meaning that several hundred still get through a month. The reported interception and disabling rate was 82% in May.

Russia, meanwhile, has been pushing drone technology of its own. It's been reported to be testing and deploying jet-powered versions of the Shahed, which is believed to be modeled after an improved Iranian design that can fly up to 500 miles per hour.

NEW YORK — Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and wire fraud Tuesday morning, three years after the dramatic $60 billion collapse of the Terra/Luna stablecoin ecosystem.



The 33-year old South Korean national arrived in court in handcuffs and a canary yellow prison jumpsuit, a metal chain around his waist. He admitted that he "knowingly engaged in a scheme to defraud and did in fact defraud" purchasers of the TerraUSD  stablecoin.



Judge Paul Engelmayer, who is overseeing the case, walked the Terra creator through the charges to establish that Kwon was indeed guilty of the allegations laid out in an earlier indictment, which included seven other charges such as securities and commodities fraud. Under the charges in the original indictment, Kwon faced a maximum sentence of 135 years in prison if convicted on all counts. Kwon's plea agreement with the government slashes his maximum sentence to 25 years — 20 for the wire fraud charge, and five for the fraud conspiracy charge, which the judge can either order to be served consecutively or concurrently.



Throughout the hearing, the judge noted that he was not bound by the DOJ's plea agreement, meaning he could sentence Kwon to a lengthier sentence than the DOJ suggested.



Under the terms of the plea agreement, laid out by an assistant U.S. attorney, Kwon agreed to pay a maximum forfeiture of $19,286,774.78 plus interest, forfeit what Engelmeyer described as a “substantial set” of properties and pay restitution. He also agreed not to contest the factual allegations in the indictment. In exchange, the DOJ agreed to recommend a maximum sentence of 12 years. Once he's served half of his ultimate sentence, the DOJ agreed to support any motion Kwon makes for an international prisoner transfer.



Kwon's attorney said there remain open charges against him in South Korea.



In a prepared statement, Kwon said he'd worked with others to defraud UST purchasers in South Korea, the Southern District of New York and other locations between 2018 and 2022, and that he'd used international and interstate wires to do so.



“Between 2018 and 2022 in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere, I knowingly agreed with others to engage in a scheme to defraud, and did in fact defraud, purchasers of the cryptocurrencies issued by my company, Terraform Labs,” Kwon said. "In 2021, I made false and misleading statements about why [UST] regained its peg," he added, noting that a trading firm had been involved. "What I did was wrong and I want to apologize for my conduct."



Kwon had repeatedly and publicly cheered on UST, criticizing detractors or anyone who questioned the token's stability.



"Have fun staying poor," he tweeted at one user on X in 2021.



Just over a dozen people sat in the gallery ahead of the hearing, with more than half of that group consisting of reporters. Throughout the hearing, the judge asked a number of procedural questions to establish that Kwon was competent to plead guilty, running briefly through his medical history and checking at multiple points that Kwon had read the filings he was agreeing to and discussed them with his legal team.



Kwon will be sentenced on Dec. 11 at 11:00 a.m. in Manhattan. By the time of his sentencing, he will have been in U.S. custody for almost a year.



Kwon has been in the U.S. since New Year's, following a lengthy extradition process with the government of Montenegro. He and Terraform Labs had already been found liable for civil fraud by a jury in a case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, following UST's collapse.

The Pump.fun token's (PUMP) ICO was among the largest in history, raising about $500 million in less than 12 minutes after launch. It launched with a fully diluted valuation of over $4 billion, and an ICO price of $0.004 per token.

Even though the PUMP token jumped to roughly $0.0068 soon after its listing, whales were quick to cash out, provoking a nearly 67% decline in the token's value. The token has finally started showing signs of a healthy recovery over the past few weeks and is now approaching the ICO price level.

But continued sell-offs by large holders have capped bullish momentum. While PUMP is still constrained by whale dominance, opportunistic traders are already looking for new cryptocurrencies with higher potential.

One standout project on their lists is Snorter Token (SNORT), the native token of a Solana-based trading bot that will power lightning-fast trades and snipes through a Telegram interface. Early investor interest has already helped the token raise more than $3 million in its recently launched presale, with some predicting that it could become one of the biggest crypto launches of 2025.

Meme coin enthusiasts are closely watching PUMP's next swing, as many see it as an important factor in determining if Solana's meme coin frenzy is still going strong.

After sliding from roughly $0.007 to an all-time low of $0.0022 on July 29, the PUMP token took a bullish stance and has been climbing within a rising wedge ever since. We're witnessing a series of higher lows and slightly shallower higher highs, indicating that buyers are still in control, but are losing a bit of momentum with each push.

The on-chain story behind that rebound is just as revealing. Pump.fun has reclaimed its position as Solana's top meme coin launchpad, hosting more than 65% of 27,500 daily launches.

This increased platform activity directly correlates with the demand for PUMP tokens, as creators and traders use the token to cover fees and participate in incentives. What's worth noting is that even with platform metrics flashing green, some heavyweight traders are already heading for the exits.

On-chain analytics firm Lookonchain notes that the whale trader ParallelAiRev has recently cashed out every one of his long bets on the PUMP token, locking in gains while the price sat near its recent peak.

Lookonchain mentions that the trader accumulated more than $1.5 million in profit over the last 30 days, placing him at the top of Hyperliquid's 30-day PUMP-trading leaderboard.

From a fundamental point of view, Pump.fun has spent about 118,000 SOL (roughly $19 million) buying back almost three billion PUMP tokens at $0.0064 each. By scooping up such a huge chunk of supply, the team has temporarily reduced the number of coins in circulation.

In theory, buybacks make each remaining token scarcer. But PUMP is still down 53% over the past month, suggesting that organic demand remains relatively low.

Given the headwinds PUMP is facing, many traders are scouting new presales for higher upside, and Snorter Token is quickly moving to the top of that list.

Snorter Bot is an automated Web3 trading solution on Telegram that will use Solana tech for higher speed and efficiency. Its goal is to help everyday users spot and act on emerging token opportunities, helping them find the next 100x gem before it goes mainstream.

To accomplish this, Snorter Bot comes equipped with advanced features that were previously reserved for professional trading tools. For instance, Snorter Bot will monitor new token launches on Solana and execute trades within milliseconds using an upgraded Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).

More importantly, the bot will also feature scam detection and honeypot filters to automatically flag suspicious contracts or potential rug pulls before any new token purchases are made.

SNORT is the utility token that will fuel the Snorter Bot platform, and holding it will unlock several benefits to users. For example, the tokens will unlock reduced trading fees as low as 0.85% per trade (versus 1.5% for non-holders) and provide access to premium bot features, including unlimited snipes.

Looking at SNORT's potential, popular market commentator ClayBro is bullish on the token's future. In his latest video, he shows us how Google's Gemini predicts SNORT could jump toward $1 by year-end and push past $2 during the next bull run peak in 2025–26.



Interested buyers can visit Snorter Token's official website to buy SNORT for a discounted presale price. They can also immediately stake SNORT for a high passive yield of up to 146% annually.

BitMine Immersion shares surged after the company revealed plans to raise up to $20 billion to expand its $5 billion Ethereum stash. It is aiming to control 5% of the token's supply.

BitMine Immersion Technology (BMNR) shares surged in pre-market trading after the crypto treasury firm announced plans to raise as much as $20 billion to buy more Ethereum (ETH-USD). The move could make it one of the largest holders of the world's second-biggest cryptocurrency.





The company, led by Fundstrat co-founder Thomas Lee, already holds nearly $5 billion in ETH as of Aug. 10. Its long-term goal is to acquire 5% of the entire ETH supply, a stash worth roughly $25 billion at today's prices.

BitMine has wasted little time in scaling up its treasury strategy. The firm previously authorized $4.5 billion in stock sales through deals with Cantor Fitzgerald and ThinkEquity, nearly exhausting that allocation. Now it is dramatically increasing its ambitions with the new $20 billion target.

The plan involves continuing to sell shares into a market that has been showing strong appetite for BMNR stock. High trading volumes, averaging $2.2 billion daily last week, mean the company can raise capital with less downward pressure on its share price. BMNR ranked as the 25th most traded U.S.-listed stock last week, surpassing heavyweights such as JPMorgan (JPM) and Micron (MU).

BitMine's aggressive buying spree is designed to accumulate and stake ETH, earning yield while competing with other digital asset treasury plays such as SharpLink Gaming (SBET). Its rivals are watching closely since the scale of this buying program could move markets if executed in full.

Chairman Tom Lee says BitMine is “leading crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV [net asset value] per share and by the high trading liquidity of our stock.” He sees both as critical advantages as the firm pushes toward its 5% ETH ownership goal.

The announcement helped extend BitMine's recent rally. BMNR shares were up over 10% in Tuesday's pre-market trading, building on Friday's near 25% gain. That buying momentum has coincided with ether hitting new cycle highs above $4,300 over the weekend, aided by aggressive accumulation from digital asset treasuries like BitMine.

If the $20 billion program is completed, BitMine would strengthen its position as one of the most influential players in ETH markets. This is a bet that could pay off handsomely if Ethereum's price continues to climb in the next bull cycle. However, with such a massive move, the gamble also comes with much more risk if crypto markets turn against them.

Based on TipRanks data, ThinkEquity analyst Ashok Kumar initiated coverage on BitMine Immersion Technologies with a Buy rating and a $60 price target. This target implies a potential upside of about 3.48% from the company's most recent close at $57.98.

- Skynet 1.0 merges AI with blockchain to enhance DeFi/NFT security through real-time threat detection and fraud reduction.

- The platform's adaptive AI capabilities could redefine transactional security standards while raising regulatory challenges in crypto-gray jurisdictions.

- By integrating predictive analytics with decentralized architecture, Skynet 1.0 may stabilize crypto markets and influence Bitcoin/Ethereum regulation frameworks.

- The innovation aligns with enterprise trends prioritizing AI accountability, exemplified by tools like Rubrik's Agent Rewind for error management.

The launch of Skynet 1.0 marks a pivotal moment in the convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Developed by a team of engineers and blockchain experts, the platform integrates AI capabilities with blockchain's core security features to address longstanding challenges in the digital currency ecosystem. The system is designed to streamline operations, detect and respond to threats in real time, and reduce fraud risks in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors. This innovation reflects a broader shift toward AI-driven security solutions in the cryptocurrency space [1].

By embedding AI into blockchain infrastructure, Skynet 1.0 introduces a new layer of transaction monitoring and verification. This is not merely a technical enhancement—it represents a fundamental shift in how digital transactions are handled. The system's ability to adapt to evolving threats and predict potential vulnerabilities could redefine the standards for transactional security. However, the integration of AI into blockchain also raises regulatory concerns, particularly in jurisdictions where cryptocurrency remains a gray area. Regulators are now faced with the challenge of adapting existing frameworks to accommodate the dynamic nature of AI-enhanced blockchain systems [1].

For the broader financial technology (FinTech) industry, the implications of Skynet 1.0 are profound. As the platform expands its reach, it could influence the way cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are traded and regulated. The heightened security offered by AI could foster greater trust among investors and users, potentially stabilizing a market historically plagued by volatility. Moreover, the predictive capabilities of AI may lead to more responsive and intelligent blockchain networks, setting a new benchmark for future innovations in the digital transaction space [1].

The emergence of AI in blockchain also aligns with wider trends in enterprise technology. Companies are increasingly recognizing the need to balance innovation with accountability, particularly as AI becomes more integrated into mission-critical systems. Tools like Rubrik's Agent Rewind, which allows for the reversal of AI-driven errors, highlight the growing emphasis on error management and user control. In a similar vein, Skynet 1.0's approach to real-time threat detection suggests a growing industry focus on both proactive and reactive AI strategies to ensure operational integrity [2].

Ultimately, Skynet 1.0 represents more than just a technological milestone—it is a harbinger of a new era in digital transactions. As AI continues to reshape industries, the ability to combine its strengths with blockchain's decentralized architecture will define the next wave of innovation. The challenge for developers, regulators, and users alike will be to harness these technologies responsibly, ensuring that progress is matched by safeguards that protect both individuals and institutions.

BitMine Immersion Technology (BMNR), the bitcoin miner that pivoted to an ether (ETH) treasury strategy under Fundstrat's Thomas Lee's leadership, is doubling down on its stock sale program, aiming to raise up to $20 billion more buy more ETH.

The company had previously authorized $4.5 billion in stock sales through agreements with Cantor Fitzgerald and ThinkEquity, and said it has already sold nearly all of that allotment, with just $723 left to sell.

BMNR's stock was up 4% pre-market.

Bitmine pursues a strategy to accumulate ETH and stake tokens for a yield, competing with rivals such as SharpLink Gaming (SBET) and others. The firm has accumulated almost $5 billion in ETH as of August 10 and ultimately aims to acquire 5% of the total ETH supply.

The firm also said on Monday that its stock was the 25th most traded among U.S.-listed companies, surpassing major stocks like JP Morgan and Micron in average daily trading volume. High trading volume allows to firm to sell shares to raise funds with less impact on the stock price.

Do Kwon, the South Korean cryptocurrency entrepreneur behind two digital currencies that lost an estimated $40 billion in 2022, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to two charges of conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud.

Kwon, 33, who co-founded Singapore-based Terraform Labs and developed the TerraUSD and Luna currencies, entered the plea at a court hearing in New York before US District Judge Paul Engelmayer.

He had pleaded not guilty in January to a nine-count indictment charging him with securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud and money laundering conspiracy.

Accused of misleading investors in 2021 about TerraUSD – a so-called stablecoin designed to maintain a value of $1 – Kwon pleaded guilty to the two counts under an agreement with the Manhattan US Attorney's office, which brought the charges.

He faces up to 25 years in prison when Engelmayer sentences him on Dec. 11, though prosecutor Kimberly Ravener said the government had agreed to advocate for a prison term of no more than 12 years provided he accepts responsibility for his crimes.

Kwon is one of several cryptocurrency moguls to face federal charges after a slump in digital token prices in 2022 prompted the collapse of a number of companies.

Prosecutors alleged that when TerraUSD slipped below its $1 peg in May 2021, he told investors a computer algorithm known as “Terra Protocol” had restored the coin's value.

Instead, they said, he arranged for a high-frequency trading firm to secretly buy millions of dollars of the token to artificially prop up its price.

Prosecutors said that false claim and others drove retail and institutional investors to buy Terraform products and boost the value of Luna – a more traditional token that fluctuated in value but was closely linked to TerraUSD – to $50 billion by the spring of 2022.

In court, Kwon apologized for his conduct.

“I made false and misleading statements about why it regained its peg by failing to disclose a trading firm's role in restoring that peg,” Kwon said. “What I did was wrong.”

Kwon agreed in 2024 to pay $80 million as a civil fine and be banned from crypto transactions as part of a $4.55 billion settlement he and Terraform reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Kwon has been detained since his extradition from Montenegro late last year.

He also faces charges in South Korea. As part of the deal, prosecutors will not oppose Kwon's potential application to be transferred abroad after serving half his US sentence, Ravener said.

 The Terraform Labs co-founder was indicted in 2023 on nine charges related to the collapse of the ecosystem, resulting in an estimated $40 billion in losses. 

Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon has changed his plea from not guilty to guilty on two counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud.

According to reporting on Tuesday from the US District Court in the Southern District of New York (SDNY), Kwon waived his right to go to trial on two of the nine charges he has been facing from the US government and pleaded guilty. The reported plea agreement with prosecutors would impose $19 million in financial penalties.

The two felony charges could carry up to a 25-year prison sentence if served consecutively, but the agreement reportedly would have prosecutors not recommend more than 12 years. Kwon's sentencing hearing was scheduled for Dec. 11.

“It will be up to me to decide what a just sentence for you would be,” said Engelmayer on Tuesday, according to Inner City Press.

The Terraform co-founder was indicted in March 2023 for charges including securities fraud, market manipulation, money laundering and wire fraud related to his role at the company. He first appeared in the New York courtroom in January after his extradition from Montenegro, pleading not guilty to all charges and remaining in US custody without bail.

After the 2022 Terra crash, Kwon's whereabouts were largely unknown until Montenegrin authorities arrested him for using falsified travel documents. He served four months in prison before US and South Korean officials both petitioned Montenegro for extradition, which was complicated by challenges in the country's lower courts.

It was unclear as of Tuesday why the Terraform co-founder had chosen to change his plea after seven months. According to court filings, US prosecutors had been discussing “pretrial motions and related issues” with Kwon's lawyers, but had still been expected to go to trial in January 2026.

Crypto-related figures facing criminal charges in SDNY have not always gotten off easy. In 2024, a federal judge sentenced former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison. Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm was recently found guilty of running an unlicensed money transmitting service and is expected to be sentenced soon, potentially facing a retrial for two charges.

The company will use the new funding to roll out this solution in Europe, Asia and North America, expand its operations and add to its engineering team, according to a Tuesday (Aug. 12) press release emailed to PYMNTS.

Riva was established earlier this year and is now inviting companies to join its waitlist, according to a banner on its website.

Riva uses a combination of traditional and blockchain-based payment routing to optimize each payment's speed and cost, according to the press release.

With this solution, the company aims to modernize B2B payments by addressing the often-unfavorable exchange rates and slow settlement times associated with cross-border transfers that are routed through banks and financial institutions, the release said.

Riva powers international payments with blockchain technology, including stablecoins, or with traditional fiat-to-fiat rails, depending on what is the best option for the client's money transfers, based on their location and other circumstances, per the release.

The company is working to obtain authorization as a payment institution across the United Kingdom and the European Union, a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license in the EU and a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license in Switzerland, according to the release.

“By combining blockchain technology with a robust regulatory framework, we're building a solution that offers businesses the speed, transparency and cost-efficiency they need to thrive in today's interconnected economy,” Riva Money co-founder and CEO Niklas Hoejman said in the release.

Malin Posern, partner and managing director at Project A, which led the funding round, said in the release that the time is right for an “infrastructure rethink” because stablecoin adoption is accelerating and regulatory frameworks are maturing.

“Riva's dual-rail system for businesses elegantly solves for both speed and flexibility in a market that's still reliant on legacy processes,” Posern said.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report “The Treasury Management Playbook: Spotlight on Cross-Border Payments” found that cross-border payments are undergoing a revolution as new solutions deliver cost-effective, real-time payment options with maximum visibility for senders and receivers.

- CryptoLottery launches as the first Web3-native global lottery platform, offering $100M jackpots and NFT-powered rewards across 195+ countries.

- Its non-custodial blockchain architecture ensures instant payouts and user fund control, aligning with DeFi principles and eliminating intermediary risks.

- Community ownership via NFTs grants ticket multipliers, IRL event access, and governance rights, fostering engagement and shared platform success.

- The platform merges live draws with blockchain transparency, redefining traditional lotteries through decentralized accessibility and verifiable fairness.

CryptoLottery has officially launched as the first global lottery platform built for the Web3 era. Designed to be community-owned, transparent, and accessible, the platform aims to redefine traditional lottery models by leveraging blockchain technology. The platform supports participation from players across 195+ countries and offers nine distinct ways to win per draw, with jackpots potentially reaching up to $100 million USD. CryptoLottery is positioned as the first truly Web3-native lottery, emphasizing non-custodial security, instant payouts, and real-world integration [1].

A key innovation of CryptoLottery is its non-custodial architecture, which ensures that users maintain full control of their funds at all times. Unlike traditional lotteries where winners may face delays in receiving payouts, CryptoLottery enables winners to receive their rewards instantly on the blockchain. This approach eliminates the risk associated with intermediaries holding funds and aligns with broader trends in decentralized finance (DeFi) [1].

The platform introduces a community-owned model, offering ticket holders and NFT participants a stake in the platform's long-term success. This structure aims to create a sense of shared ownership and incentivize engagement among users. Additionally, the integration of NFTs goes beyond mere collectibility—these digital assets provide tangible benefits such as ticket multipliers and access to premium in-real-life (IRL) events. For example, some NFTs offer a 20% ticket multiplier, allowing users to receive six tickets for the price of five [1].

A special NFT collection, known as the “CryptoLottery Owners Pass,” has been introduced with a total supply of 150 units. These NFTs are built on the Solana blockchain and are available at no cost. Holders of the Owners Pass receive additional privileges and benefits, reinforcing the platform's commitment to rewarding engaged participants [1].

CryptoLottery also combines the excitement of live, in-real-life draws with the transparency of blockchain verification. This hybrid model allows players to experience the spectacle of traditional lottery events while benefiting from the auditability and trust provided by blockchain technology. The result is a platform that seeks to merge entertainment with verifiable fairness [1].

Michael Gonzalez, founder of CryptoLottery and former founder of FitTea, emphasized that the platform was developed to modernize lotteries for a digital-first world. He highlighted the platform's commitment to transparency, accessibility, and real value for global players. This vision aligns with the broader adoption of blockchain-based services in the lottery and gaming sectors [1].

CryptoLottery positions itself as the official lottery of Web3, aiming to bring the thrill of global lottery draws to a decentralized and digital-first audience. With its focus on instant payouts, community ownership, and NFT utility, the platform represents a new approach to lottery platforms that leverages the strengths of blockchain technology. As the Web3 ecosystem continues to evolve, platforms like CryptoLottery may play a significant role in redefining how users engage with digital rewards and value [1].

 The new whale's investments came amid record-breaking Ether ETF inflows, which may help Ether recapture its old all-time high, market watchers told Cointelegraph. 

A new cryptocurrency whale has purchased $1.34 billion worth of Ether in the past eight days, outpacing record US spot Ether ETF inflows and fueling speculation over the token's price trajectory ahead of key US inflation data.  

The whale acquired 312,052 Ether (ETH) across 10 newly created cryptocurrency wallets, according to crypto intelligence platform Lookonchain.

The whale has acquired $300 million more than the record-breaking inflows to US spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which amassed $1 billion worth of Ether on Monday, their largest daily net inflows since launch.

Analysts say the billion-dollar accumulation could help push Ether closer to its previous all-time high of $4,890, still more than 12% above current levels. The surge in demand comes as investors await this week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports, which could shape expectations for the US Federal Reserve's Sept. 17 interest rate decision.

The CPI and PPI reports are “key” for shaping monetary policy expectations, as higher-than-expected inflation data may “weaken” investor appetite and “stall” the current crypto rally, according to Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, chief investment officer at crypto trading and asset management platform XBTO. “The rally fits within ETH's typical behaviour and could pause or consolidate without fresh catalysts.

“It's near-neutral Z-score (–0.06) shows that, despite the size of the move, it remains well within ETH's normal volatility range,” he said, adding that the continued corporate treasury buying may enable Ether to test its prior all-time high.

Markets are pricing in an 82% chance that the Fed will keep interest rates steady during the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Sept. 17, according to the latest estimates of the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

Still, Ether is seeing aggressive profit-taking from short-term Ether holders, signaling that this cohort may expect a pullback.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) stock popped as much as 5% at the opening bell on Tuesday after ethereum (ETH-USD) rose another 5% to trade north of $4,400 and the company announced plans to sell up to another $20 billion worth of stock to increase its holdings of the cryptocurrency.

Bitmine, whose board is led by investor Tom Lee, announced Monday that its holdings of ETH stood at $4.96 billion, or a little over 1.15 million tokens, meaning the company owns roughly 1% of all tokens in circulation.

The company's goal is to eventually acquire 5% of the world's outstanding ETH tokens. Monday's news pushed the stock up more than 14%. The stock is up over 600% this year.

"We are leading crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of our stock," Tom Lee said in a press release announcing the company's latest ethereum purchase.

Bitmine is one of a host of cryptocurrency "treasury companies," a strategy most prolifically pioneered by Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), which holds large amounts of bitcoin on its balance sheet.

In plain terms, the companies pursuing the strategy issue stock and use the proceeds from the issuance to buy cryptocurrencies that are held on their balance sheet.

Another major ETH market holder alongside Bitmine, cryptocurrency broker Coinbase (COIN), saw shares up more than 2% in premarket trading on Tuesday. Coinbase operates one of the largest transaction-processing chains on ethereum and holds on its balance sheet more than 100,000 tokens, valued at more than $500 million, according to trade publication Coindesk.

The crypto treasury strategy has attracted a variety of companies, including perennial meme stock GameStop (GME), which announced in March its intent to hold bitcoin on its balance sheet, and ETH treasury holder SharpLink Gaming (SBET).

Ether has soared over the past month, trading up more than 50% to a value of more than $4,400 per token. The cryptocurrency has yet to crest its high-water mark of more than $4,600, which it attained in October 2021.

Bitcoin, comparatively, is up a bit over 1% over the past month.

Ether received a boon in June with the highly successful IPO of fintech giant Circle Internet Group (CRCL), which offers the stablecoin USD Coin. The ethereum network has also gained widespread recognition as the ecosystem of choice for most stablecoin mintings, according to Coindesk.

Solana meme coins are one of the worst-performing crypto asset classes of the day, according to CoinGecko, with the category as a whole slumping by 8.5%. It comes as experts say that investors are rotating funds into “quality-focused” assets such as Ethereum and other leading altcoins.

Major Solana meme coins, such as absurdist meme Chill House, the lowbrow token Fartcoin, and gaming-inspired meme MLG, have all dropped by double digits on the day. The network's second-largest meme coin BONK has fallen 6.5%, despite the announcement that a publicly traded company intends to acquire $115 million worth of the token by the end of the year.

It's worth noting that the total meme coin sector is down 4.1% on the day and the entire crypto market is trading flat, per CoinGecko, but Solana memes have underperformed the wider meme coin market. Meanwhile, it's been a great month for Ethereum, up 4.7% on the day per CoinGecko data.

“The ETH ecosystem, DeFi, and higher-beta L1s have generally held up better than meme-coins. SOL continues to lag, with competitors questioning its narrative,” Max Shannon, senior associate at crypto index provider Bitwise, told Decrypt.

It follows a spike in institutional interest in ETH, as $10.87 billion in total has flowed into Ethereum ETFs while public treasury companies have acquired more than $14 billion. Ethereum ETFs and strategic reserves now account for almost 8% of ETH's total supply.

“Our institutional clients are becoming increasingly fundamental-discerning and quality-focused,” Shannon explained. “The emerging narrative is ETH as the backbone for institutional capital moving on-chain: Ethereum combines a long operating history, zero downtime, and leading decentralization and liquidity.”

As such, the best performing assets on the day are projects like the purpose-built real-world asset network Provenance Blockchain, which has jumped 10.2%. Over the week, other “quality-focused” projects have seen the largest gains, like the stablecoin issuer Ethena, which spiked 40.5 in the past seven days%.

“Solana meme coins are down and marking one of the sharpest sector declines, while higher-liquidity altcoins are drawing flows,” Jamie Elkaleh, Chief Marketing Officer at Bitget Wallet, told Decrypt.

Elkaleh added that the pattern “points to a clear capital shift: traders are trimming exposure to the highest-beta, thin-liquidity bets and reallocating into deeper markets with stronger narratives and institutional participation, especially ahead of macro events like the U.S. CPI print.”

That said, volume in the Solana trenches saw a steady increase over the past seven days, according to Dune data, spiking to $235 million in daily volume across token launchpads on Monday. The increase has occurred amid a battle for market share between token launchpads, with Pump.fun reclaiming its crown on Wednesday.

Still, per CoinGecko, Solana is down just 0.5% on the day as the third-worst-performing asset in the top 10 cryptocurrencies—behind XRP, which set a new all-time high last month, and Dogecoin.

“Although memecoins remain the most actively traded assets on Solana DEXs, their share has recently dropped to 44% from a mid-July peak of 73%,” Illia Otychenko, Lead Analyst at crypto exchange CEX.IO, told Decrypt. “This indicates waning interest even within the Solana ecosystem, which could be the catalyst behind their contraction.”

Qubic, a project led by former IOTA co-founder Sergey Ivancheglo, says it has secured more than 51% of Monero's global hashrate, a milestone that, if true, gives it the ability to reorganize blocks, censor transactions, and attempt double-spends on the privacy-focused blockchain. 

Ivancheglo framed the move as a stress test to help the Monero community prepare for future network threats, but the announcement has triggered sharp debate among developers and security experts.

A 51% attack occurs when a single entity or coordinated group controls a majority of a proof-of-work network's hashrate. Ethereum Classic suffered multiple reorganizations in 2020, resulting in millions of dollars in losses, while Bitcoin Gold faced similar assaults in 2018 and 2020. 

Smaller networks like Verge have also been targeted, demonstrating how concentrated hashing power can destabilize and entire cryptocurrency network.

Monero, which uses the CPU-friendly RandomX algorithm, has long prided itself on resisting ASIC centralization. Qubic's “useful proof-of-work” (uPoW) model repurposes Monero mining rewards by converting XMR into USDT, then using the proceeds to buy and burn QUBIC tokens, a deflationary mechanism that doubles as a liquidity sink for its own ecosystem.

From mid-May to late July, Qubic's share of the network jumped from less than 2% to over 25%, at times topping pool rankings.

Ledger CTO Charles Guillemet warned on X that Monero “appears to be in the midst of a successful 51% attack,” citing signs of a major chain reorganization, with several other industry experts like SlowMist founder Yu Xian expressing their doubt over Qubic's economics.

Whether the events mark a hostile takeover or simply a stress test, XMR has responded negatively, dropping by 6.65% in the past 24 hours to compound a 16% decline over the past week.

Markets are on high alert ahead of US inflation data set to be released on Tuesday, which could set the stage for crypto's next rally.

That's according to Alice Liu, head of research at CoinMarketCap, who said that the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, could “lock in expectations for a September Fed rate cut, which is generally bullish risk-on assets like crypto.”

Low rates usually incentivises investors to tap into riskier bets like digital assets.

The CPI figures “could potentially trigger Bitcoin's next all-time high,” Liu said in comments shared with DL News. 

The new data comes as Bitcoin trades around $118,500 after surging past $122,000 over the weekend, reversing last week's losses, with Ethereum gaining over 20% in the same period. 

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes the CPI figures every month. It is a key economic metric closely followed by policymakers, businesses, and markets, and is seen as one of the most important macro events this month for both Wall Street and digital assets. 

A lower CPI figure could solidify expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September while a hotter inflation read may hit Fed rate cut chances and weigh on crypto markets.

The new numbers are “poised to be one of the most critical macro data releases in recent memory for risk assets,” analysts at Presto Labs wrote in a Tuesday note to investors.

Several analysts have said they anticipate that crypto prices will soon hit record highs. 

Bitwise, Bernstein and Standard Chartered have all predicted that Bitcoin's price will hit $200,000 before the end of the year. 

Even so, Liu notes that Bitcoin and Ethereum options trades have surged to “near yearly highs” of $43 billion and $14 billion respectively. 

“This high open interest from derivatives traders could amplify volatility, so be cautious of short squeezes, sudden liquidations, or sharp price moves,” Liu said.

The Fed has held its benchmark rate at 4.25%–4.50% all year. Markets are pricing an 84.4% chance of a September cut, according to the CME FedWatch tool. That's up from the beginning of August when traders put the chances at 40%.

 The end of the almost five-year legal dispute will enable the agency to dedicate more time to developing clear regulatory frameworks, according to SEC Chair Paul Atkins. 

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is signaling an increasing focus on developing a clear cryptocurrency regulatory framework after ending one of the industry's longest-running legal battles.

The SEC and Ripple Labs ended their almost five-year dispute after both parties filed to drop their legal appeals and bear their costs and fees, according to a filing last Thursday with the Second Circuit Appeals Court. 

The case's conclusion is a “welcome development” that ensures “minds once occupied with litigation now can concentrate on creating a clear regulatory framework for crypto,” said SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce in a Monday X post.

“With this chapter closed, we now have an opportunity to shift our energy from the courtroom to the policy drafting table,” said SEC Chair Paul Atkins in response to Peirce's post. “Our focus should be on building a clear regulatory framework that fosters innovation while protecting investors,” he added.

The SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, alleging the company raised $1.3 billion through unregistered XRP securities sales. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP was not a security when sold to retail investors but was a security in sales to institutions. Ripple was fined $125 million in August 2024.

The end of the case comes as lawmakers advance the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, known as the CLARITY Act. The bill aims to define the structure of digital asset markets.

Republican lawmakers and the Senate Banking Committee aim to pass the bill by Sept. 30 despite growing signs of pushback from Democratic Party lawmakers.

Earlier in July, leading Democratic Party members in the House of Representatives announced a collective effort to oppose Republican efforts to pass so-called “dangerous” legislation, signaling deepening political division between the two sides of the aisle.

“[Republicans are] doubling down by fast-tracking a dangerous package of crypto legislation through Congress,” said House Financial Services Committee ranking member Maxine Waters, specifically criticizing the CLARITY Act and the  Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which seeks to prohibit the launch of a US central bank digital currency.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Tanvirul Islam Prince, founder of ECM Coin, is integrating blockchain into e-commerce to address the lack of decentralized payment infrastructure.

- The ECM ecosystem includes live platforms like AndroMarkets and a planned ICO to fund blockchain development and metaverse expansion.

- ECM Coin aims to bridge the $8 trillion e-commerce gap with low-fee transactions and real-world usability, not just as an investment asset.

- Supported by BigBull Capital and Al Wadiat, the project emphasizes security through audits and token burns to protect investors.

Tanvirul Islam Prince, founder of ECM Coin and CEO of METAFUSION LABS LLC, is pioneering the integration of blockchain technology into the global e-commerce sector. With a 15-year background in capital markets, including experience in crypto, forex, and stocks, Prince identified a significant gap in the e-commerce industry: the absence of a blockchain-based payment infrastructure tailored for real-world commerce [1]. In 2020, he conceptualized ECM Coin, and by 2022, the platform began building community engagement through MyCoinPoll.com. Today, the ECM ecosystem includes multiple platforms such as bCoinMart, AndroMarkets, CryptoCoinEarning, and the Androverse metaverse [1].

The ECM Coin ICO is currently live, offering 50 million tokens at $1.20 each. Funds raised will support the development of the ECM Blockchain, integration with e-commerce platforms, expansion of the crypto exchange, and growth of the metaverse economy. The project has a clear long-term roadmap extending through 2028, including international exchange listings, strategic e-commerce partnerships, and the launch of ECM payment gateways [1]. The company also plans regular token burn events to manage supply and value [1].

What distinguishes ECM Coin is its integrated ecosystem, which spans exchange, staking, and metaverse components under one brand. Unlike many blockchain projects, several of its ecosystem components are already operational, including AndroMarkets, which is live and functioning ahead of the ICO's completion. This early delivery is seen as a strong indicator of the project's capability and real-world readiness [1].

The global e-commerce market is projected to exceed $8 trillion USD by 2027, yet cryptocurrencies currently account for less than 2% of transactions. ECM Coin aims to bridge this gap by offering low-fee, fast transactions and seamless integration for both consumers and merchants. Prince emphasized that the goal is not to create another investment asset but to build a digital currency that can be used for daily transactions [1].

Security and transparency are core to the ECM Coin project. The company has committed to regular audits and public reporting on development milestones. Tokenomics are structured with clear allocations and planned token burns, reinforcing a transparent approach to investor protection [1].

The project is supported by BigBull Capital LLC and angel investor Al Wadiat Financing Broker. Prince leads a global team of 45+ members in executing the vision of a blockchain-powered e-commerce future [1].

The ECM ICO is currently open for participation, with opportunities for investors, merchants, and partners to engage through official channels. The project's upcoming ECM Blockchain mainnet is targeted for launch in Q4 2025 [1].

 Contributor. 

Fintech powerhouse Stripe is secretly building a high-performance blockchain called “Tempo,” per a now-removed job posting and Fortune's reporting. This payments-optimized chain would fill a critical gap in Stripe's crypto stack, complementing its recent acquisitions of stablecoin startup Bridge and wallet infrastructure provider Privy.

Stablecoins promise to make crypto mainstream by delivering faster, cheaper, more interconnected global payments. The paradox: the same move could undercut what the technology set out to achieve. Add the rush to branded rails—Robinhood's chain on Arbitrum, Coinbase's Base on the OP Stack, and now Stripe's Tempo—and we could end up close to where we started, just with block explorers. Worse, market concentration may rise if a few players use stablecoins to reach previously unimaginable scale. With the GENIUS Act now law, the next 12–18 months will likely determine the outcome. We've seen this tension before in the early internet's open web versus walled gardens.

In the history of technology, the pendulum regularly swings between centralization and decentralization. Even when a technology has a decentralizing effect, economies of scale in a new dimension—whether complementary resources, talent, brand, or distribution—inevitably become vectors of concentration. Once concentration becomes too high, the ingenuity of entrepreneurs and developers invents a new approach to reverse it.

A prominent example is the early internet, which brought a wave of entry and competition to the heavily concentrated industries of telecommunications, retail, and media—only to create the perfect conditions for today's tech giants to scale through network effects and capture a sizable share of value.

Although the underlying internet protocols remained open and neutral, massive digital platforms at the application layer walled off participants from competing services by strategically breaking interoperability. From email to social media to payments, we spend most of our time and money within the confines of what the tech giants have designed for us. And while we are clearly better off—more choice, lower prices—it's increasingly clear that some would prefer a world where platforms do not have as much power and influence over them.

Crypto's reason for existence was to break free from centralized intermediaries. After the 2008 financial crisis, Satoshi wanted to create a world where anyone could exchange value without having to trust a central bank or financial institution ever again. And while the original Bitcoin vision of a fully democratic network—“one‑CPU‑one‑vote”—didn't pan out due to economies of scale in mining, Bitcoin did deliver what more and more financial institutions and some governments now recognize as a novel and neutral financial asset.

Inspired by Bitcoin, entrepreneurs and developers have applied the same principles in an attempt to bring decentralization back to other digital platforms—starting with payments, but branching out into finance, marketplaces, messaging, and social media. Overall, progress toward decentralization is mixed: while it's true that Bitcoin allows anyone around the world to be their own bank, the vast majority of consumers and institutions rely heavily on intermediaries for custody and use. Similarly, solutions that offer consumers greater control over their private data and the content they create have stayed niche—often because they lag in usability and convenience relative to the centralized counterparts they're trying to replace. Convenience eats privacy for lunch any day—and it's difficult to undo the entrenched network effects of the leading digital platforms.

In payments, the most critical battle is unfolding now. Legacy infrastructure is siloed, and incumbents have tremendous power over what we can access—and on what terms. Because of winner‑take‑all dynamics, markets can become so concentrated that the public sector has to step in—the most salient example is China's introduction of a central bank digital currency to unravel the payments oligopoly established by Ant Group and Tencent.

Crypto is a natural, market‑driven solution to this. It provides neutral and decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, as well as truly open and interoperable financial rails via their base layers. But as the technology has matured, two core problems have emerged.

The first problem is that cryptocurrencies are volatile and therefore expensive for payments and financial contracts. To address this, the market has focused on fiat‑backed stablecoins; this inevitably leads to centralization because issuance and sound management require a regulated financial entity to be in charge of—and accountable for—reserve operations. While distributed governance of a stablecoin network is technically possible, it is extremely difficult to get the design right. Libra is the most prominent example: despite backing from more than two dozen leading global companies and countless resources dedicated to establishing credible distributed governance, the project was always perceived as Meta's initiative.

Banks have tried for more than a decade to come together as consortia in response to crypto, and, to date, no joint project has delivered anything tangible. The reason is obvious: until the situation is truly dire, competitors are unlikely to commit to a joint solution—so, in the meantime, everyone hedges their bets across multiple tracks.

Intuitively, distributed ownership of a stablecoin network makes sense and is not that different from what ultimately made Visa scale in the 1970s—when Bank of America relinquished control of the BankAmericard credit card program to respond to increasing competition from the consortium that would become Mastercard.

Networks of crypto exchanges and fintechs, such as the Global Dollar Network, may be able to move faster, given the agility of the new entrants backing them, but they will still need to strike the right balance between economic incentives and governance to shift members from a wait‑and‑see mode—where everyone hopes to free‑ride on others' efforts—into action. Even Circle's Centre Consortium, which had only Circle and Coinbase as members, was dissolved and converted into a simple revenue‑sharing agreement.

So, while there might be a solution to the decentralized governance of a stablecoin, what we know is that, to date, the only working model is one that places a single entity in charge of everything. This is, of course, problematic in the long term, and while issuers today control only the asset, they have already started expanding their offerings in ways that limit openness. For example, Circle announced its payment network (CPN), which places it at the center of how payments are executed—from defining rules and eligibility, to inserting itself into every API interaction and price and liquidity discovery, to, of course, collecting a fee. Put together, this setup is not that different from the model that has allowed Visa and Mastercard to dominate payments for decades.

The second problem crypto has run into is one that is deeply tied to its roots: decentralization is expensive. The economic consequence is that you can only afford it where it truly matters. To date, among networks at scale, that's been true only for the base layers of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. At most, that yields a few thousand decentralized transactions per second globally across all of them combined—a far cry from what global payments would require, even before you layer financial services on top.

As a result, most transactions no longer occur on the base layers (L1s) but on a sprawling ecosystem of high‑throughput scaling solutions (L2s). L2s offer near‑zero fees and instant settlement, and they're profitable because they internalize Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)—the gains from reordering, inserting, or omitting transactions in a block.

While crypto purists might decry this trend, it aligns precisely with economic theory: users are willing to pay a premium for decentralization and censorship resistance at the core settlement layer, yet they readily trade some of that for greater centralization in higher layers to gain lower costs and faster speeds. The base layers remain open and trustless, and depending on the application, participants may compromise further—even embracing fully trusted, centralized solutions.

This trade‑off is broader than a user's decision to be their own bank and self‑custody funds versus accepting some degree of trust in a third‑party wallet. When building products, Coinbase, Robinhood, and the like care deeply that the underlying network stays neutral and does not play favorites among applications, developers, or businesses—the way the tech giants do on their platforms. Essentially, they are willing to pay for decentralization and neutrality to reduce the risk of hold‑up and expropriation—something that has repeatedly played out on traditional digital platforms.

To fully grasp what fast, low‑cost L2s will do to payments and competition in crypto, look no further than what the internet did to news and media: as the cost of distributing—and now, with AI, also generating—large swaths of content fell to zero, business models had to evolve drastically, and massive aggregators (Google, Facebook, Spotify, etc.) emerged to take advantage of the new economics at play. Because L2s remove friction, offer convenience, and allow builders to deliver experiences much closer to traditional fintech products, they are the obvious layer where most of the value will be created—and appropriated.

Furthermore, as basic money becomes free and commoditized, competition shifts to the value‑added services and workflows associated with it. That's exactly where fintechs, neobanks, crypto exchanges, and even traditional financial institutions have a significant advantage.

Any one of these players, if it executes well over the next couple of years, can use the technology to establish the first truly massive and global financial network. Once it reaches scale, it could also progressively degrade interoperability, appropriating more of the value—much as today's internet giants did.

So what's the most likely scenario? Based on how strong and persistent network effects have been in crypto over the last decade, it's safe to assume that payments and financial services will disproportionately gravitate toward a couple of leading blockchains. The remaining chains will need to specialize within an industry vertical to stay relevant. Most activity will take place not on their decentralized base layers but on scaling layers branded and shaped by crypto and fintech players (e.g., Base, Robinhood Chain), applications (e.g., Unichain, World Chain), and financial institutions (e.g., Kinexys, Fnality, Partior).

Players that control distribution—whether on the consumer, merchant, or institutional side—have a massive advantage, as they own the interface between the blockchain and the real world. Blockchains drastically lower the cost of verifying and coordinating onchain data, but their value is limited without a strong nexus with complementary offchain information—identity, compliance, credentials, creditworthiness, and more. That's where friction persists—and where economies of scale will decide winners and losers.

This is why stablecoin issuers have strong incentives either to commoditize the rails—by issuing on multiple networks and positioning themselves at the center of interoperability across them (e.g., Circle's Cross‑Chain Transfer Protocol)—or to nudge most activity to a network they control, such as a new L2 or a higher‑level protocol like CPN. Either strategy gives them a shot at becoming massive global fintech leaders and capturing most of the value the technology creates.

Meanwhile, crypto and fintech players will want to shift those same valuable transactions to a network over which they have more sway, such as a branded L2. In doing so, they'll also want either to commoditize stablecoins and other tokenized assets, or to issue their own. In the latter scenario, stablecoins may well be used as a loss leader to expand the reach of a fintech's offering, and domestic stablecoins will be issued to gain more control over the FX market and support local use cases. Real‑world assets (RWAs), memecoins, other tokens, and applications that are truly differentiated and exclusive to those networks may also help these branded chains retain volume within their borders. The same companies will be able to develop clever rewards and loyalty programs that increase consumer and business stickiness within their ecosystems.

As convenience and economic reality win over dogmatism, crypto will look very different than it is today. The good news is that, as part of that transformation, it will be far more useful. And while that may come with more centralization, the fact that the underlying protocols are open source and forkable means that, no matter how large some players may become, they face more pressure to retain greater interoperability than under the status quo. 
 It is also possible that because crypto protocols allow for new market design and incentives, the ultimate solution will be something that was not quite achievable for the internet protocols—which did not have built‑in monetization mechanisms. Regardless, once centralization materializes, some clever group of developers will work hard to undo it, and the cycle will repeat.

Heads up!

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The theory of continental drift was proposed by German meteorologist Alfred Wegener more than a century ago in 1912. According to the theory, the continents we know today were once connected as one big “supercontinent” called Pangea. The theory explains why continental coasts align like puzzle pieces, and why fossils from certain species are found in vastly different places. 

Experts suggest that the supercontinent began breaking apart around 200 million years ago—a timeline that has been widely accepted as geological history for decades. But an international research team may be challenging that notion. A new study published in the journal Geology suggests that a giant, hot blob split Greenland from North America 80 million years ago—and now, it's heading toward New York. 

“This thermal upwelling has long been a puzzling feature of North American geology.” lead author of the study Tom Gernon said in a press release. “Our research suggests it's part of a much larger, slow-moving process deep underground that could potentially help explain why mountain ranges like the Appalachians are still standing.”

The hot zone on which the study focused is a feature called the North Atlantic Anomaly (NAA), residing deep beneath the crust. Experts estimate that the molten rock mass is around 350 kilometers (218 miles) wide, and it currently sits 200 kilometers (124 miles) beneath the Appalachian Mountains in New England. 

Using geodynamic simulations, tectonic plate reconstructions, and seismic tomography data, researchers traced the origins of the mass back to the Labrador Sea, where Canada and Greenland began splitting around 80 million years ago. Researchers estimate that the blob migrates at a rate of 20 kilometers (12 miles) per million years. Per the team's calculations, the mass is steadily heading toward New York City—but Yankees fans, fear not! Experts anticipate the center of the anomaly won't pass through the Big Apple for the next 15 trillion years. 

The study expands on recent research that proposed a new idea called the “mantle wave” theory, which posits that the molten material beneath Earth's surface behaves almost like a lava lamp. When continents divide, hot, dense rock bubbles off the base of tectonic plates, and the “waves” move across continents' lower surfaces. Once beneath the base of a continent, the heat from the blob works like the fire in a hot air balloon, making the continent more buoyant. Researchers believe this phenomenon could've caused ancient mountains to be “further uplifted” over the past few million years.  

“Our earlier research shows that these ‘drips' of rock can form in series, like domino stones when they fall one after the other, and sequentially migrate over time,” co-author Sascha Brune said in the press release. “The feature we see beneath New England is very likely one of these drips, which originated far from where it now sits.”

Needless to say, this is certainly an example of “slow and steady wins the race”—at least when it comes to forming the continents. According to Gernon, there is still a lot to learn about how the continents came to be arranged in the way we see them today. 

“Even though the surface shows little sign of ongoing tectonics, deep below, the consequences of ancient rifting are still playing out,” he explained in the release. “The legacy of continental breakup on other parts of the Earth system may well be far more pervasive and long-lived than we previously realised.”

Researchers from the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), part of City of Hope, and the Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center have identified a potential biomarker for long COVID.

If the findings of their study are confirmed by other research centers, the biomarker could be the first specific and quantifiable indicator for confirming long COVID. Currently, clinicians confer a diagnosis of long COVID based upon a collection of symptoms that patients develop after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

"If a patient arrives in clinic and they relate the persistence of typical signs and symptoms of long COVID, 12 weeks or more after COVID -19 infection, I give them a presumptive diagnosis, but I don't have any blood tests or biomarkers to confirm this diagnosis," said William Stringer, M.D., a Lundquist Institute investigator and senior author on the study.

The study results, reported in the journal Infection, detail the detection of SARS-CoV-2 protein fragments within extracellular vesicles (EVs) -- tiny, naturally occurring packages that help cells share proteins, metabolites, and other materials. The researchers collected and analyzed blood samples from 14 patients over 12 weeks of aerobic exercise training (56 samples in all) in a clinical trial led by Stringer in long COVID.

The researchers found 65 distinct protein fragments from SARS-CoV-2 inside the EVs. These fragments come from the virus's Pp1ab protein, an RNA Replicase enzyme which is key to how the virus copies itself and makes other viral particles. This protein is found uniquely in SARS-CoV-2, and not in uninfected human cells, noted Asghar Abbasi, Ph.D., a Lundquist Institute investigator and first author of the study.

Significantly, the researchers found that these viral peptides were demonstrated in each subject, but not each blood draw, in the EVs of Long COVID patients and were not detected in a separate control group of pre-pandemic EV samples.

These findings add to growing evidence that suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may persist in certain body tissues long after the initial infection. Some groups hypothesize these lingering viral reservoirs could play a role in Long COVID. How the virus reaches tissues without its usual entry points -- such as the brain -- remains an open question, and may be related to EV particles.

"We thought that maybe if the virus is circulating or moving in the body, we should try to see if EVs are carrying those viral fragments," Abbasi explained.

This idea became part of an ongoing clinical trial led by Drs. Abbasi and Stringer, which was already studying EVs to see if they are linked to changes in immune function related to exercise and post-exertional malaise, a common symptom in these patients.

"While promising, the molecular signal of the viral peptides within the study samples was observed to be subtle and not consistently detected at every blood collection time point," said Patrick Pirrotte, Ph.D., associate professor at TGen, director of the Integrated Mass Spectrometry Shared Resource at TGen and City of Hope, and co-senior author of the study. "There's still a lot to unpack that we don't know at this point."

For instance, he added, the researchers don't know if the exercise itself drives the expression of viral programs intracellularly, and then those viral programs result in proteins that are going to be shed, or if there is a permanent reservoir in those cells, and it's just a matter of detecting it at a certain time point. Although the identified peptides originated from one of the virus' largest proteins, the researchers did not detect other comparably large proteins indicative of active viral replication. It's possible that the peptides contained in the EVs are just molecular "trash" leftover after the formation of new viral proteins.

"We haven't run [our tests] on people without long COVID symptoms who are currently, or who were, infected with COVID," said Stringer. "This raises the question: is this just continuing to take out the trash from the COVID infected cell or is this really ongoing replication someplace? I think that's the mechanistic issue that needs to be resolved in future studies."

The Pulmonary Education and Research Foundation (PERF) and the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine (DGSoM)-Ventura County Community Foundation (VCCF) funded this research.

As the demand for plant-based meat and dairy options grows, vegan burgers, nuggets, and beverages have been in the spotlight for sustainable protein alternatives. But unlike their meatless burger counterparts, plant-based eggs haven't received the same attention from researchers -- until now.

Enter Da Eun Kim, a doctoral student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and Brenna Ellison, a professor at Purdue University. Together, they set out to answer a deceptively simple question: What makes someone willing to purchase a vegan egg?

Their new study is one of the first to examine this question. Using an experimental method known as a vignette design, researchers tested how factors such as price, product type, and setting influence people's behavior.

"We wanted to measure the consumer's perception about plant-based eggs," said Kim, who is a graduate student in the Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics, part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences at Illinois. "A vignette experiment allowed us to create hypothetical scenarios and isolate what consumers really think."

Instead of directly asking people if they would purchase a plant-based egg, the vignette method asked participants to imagine they were about to eat breakfast. This meal would take place either at home or in a restaurant, and consumers had a choice between scrambled eggs or pancakes made with plant-based eggs.

The results were both surprising and informative.

"We expected the setting to be more important, as we thought the novelty of the plant-based egg product would lead people to want to eat it in a restaurant where chefs know how to prepare the product in a way that tastes good," Ellison said. "Surprisingly, the location of where you were eating, whether it be at a restaurant versus at home, didn't have as much of an effect as we imagined."

Additionally, consumers were more likely to purchase plant-based eggs when they were mixed into something familiar, like pancakes, instead of served on their own.

The team also asked participants to rate how plant-based eggs would compare to traditional ones. Unsurprisingly, expected taste and appearance still favor the classic egg. But the plant-based version came out on top for environmental impact and animal welfare. This reflects a broader trend in food science, where ethical motivations are beginning to influence consumer choices.

Does this mean every consumer will want to purchase plant-based eggs? "Probably not," Ellison said. "However, we did find that consumers who had previous experience trying plant-based eggs were more likely to purchase them compared to people without that experience. This suggests that consumers had a positive experience with the product previously."

While familiarity with plant-based eggs is helpful, familiarity with the end product, such as pancakes, may also be key. "Introducing them as an ingredient, especially in a product that consumers are comfortable with, is a way to get people over any 'mental hurdles' associated with trying plant-based eggs," Ellison said.

These results offer a clear message for the industry: give people an easy, tasty, and recognizable way to try something new.

"There are still sensory barriers," Kim said. "I've tried the liquid version that comes in a bottle, like egg whites. The taste was different, but I was surprised the texture was very similar to traditional eggs."

That firsthand experience echoes the study's findings; while taste and texture still matter, many consumers just need a nudge to take the first bite. And the best way to do that may be through a subtle swap in a familiar dish.

While plant-based eggs might not be ready to replace the classic scramble at every breakfast table, they are finding their niche. Science shows that people may not be ready to eat them plain -- but mix them in, make it easy, and meet consumers where they are.

The Photorhabdus virulence cassette is a microbial nanosyringe that can be engineered to deliver protein cargos into human cells. Here we further modify this system to incorporate exogenous cargos and targeting moieties in vitro. We show that this method, termed SPEAR, enables loading of different types of cargo (including folded ribonucleoproteins and single-stranded DNA) and targeting of defined cell types both in vitro and in vivo.

Contractile injection systems (CISs) encompass a broad class of syringe-like protein complexes that enable prokaryotes and their viruses to inject effector molecules into nearby cells1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. We previously reprogrammed an extracellular CIS (the Photorhabdus virulence cassette (PVC)) to deliver proteins into human cells13, highlighting this system's potential for use as a therapeutic delivery technology. Here, we engineer PVCs to extend their utility, enabling delivery of different types of cargo and compatibility with a wider range of cell-type-specific targeting proteins, leading to a system termed spike engineering and retargeting (SPEAR; Fig. 1a,b).

a,b, SPEAR harnesses two attachment points to enable modular in vitro cargo loading (via self-assembly of Pvc10 onto Pvc8) and retargeting (via conjugation of antibodies to Pvc13). c, A cargo domain (Cas9) fused to the PVC spike (Pvc8) or spike tip (Pvc10) can be visualized loading onto PVCs. A novel density (designated with an arrow) can be observed at the base of the particle; scale bar, 25 nm. d, RT–qPCR analysis of the complexes from c indicates that Pvc8/Pvc10–Cas9 fusions can load onto PVCs as RNPs. e, PVCs can deliver Cas9 RNPs into HEK293FT cells. Cas9 activity required proper PVC targeting; T, targeted (Pvc13–Ad5 knob); UT, untargeted (truncated Pvc13). f, Comparison of spike-based cargo loading (this study) to tube-based (internal) cargo loading13,21. Cas9 loaded into the PVC tube (via N-terminal fusion of the Pdp1 N-terminal domain (NTD)) was unable to co-deliver sgRNA, while Pvc8/Pvc10–Cas9 yielded transfection-independent gene editing. g, Spike-based cargo loading can be combined with tube-based cargo loading to enable delivery of a two-component base editor (ZFD) with a single PVC design. All values in d–g are shown as mean ± s.d. with n = 5 biological replicates. Statistical significance was computed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Bonferroni post hoc test; ****P < 0.0001; ***P < 0.001; NS, not significant.

Source data

In our first-generation PVC design, we used the injection system's native cargo loading mechanism, which is limited to proteins. To accommodate different cargos, we took inspiration from a related family of CISs (type VI secretion systems (T6SSs)), which can fuse cargo domains to the spike at the base of the complex14,15,16,17. Given the structural similarity between the T6SS spike complex (VgrG/PAAR) and the PVC spike complex (Pvc8/Pvc10)3,14,18, and the fact that T6SSs have been successfully engineered to load exogenous cargos via the spike19,20, we imagined implementing an analogous spike-mediated cargo loading strategy in PVCs (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). After deleting endogenous cargos, we fused a heterologous cargo domain (Cas9) to the spike (Pvc8) or spike tip (Pvc10) in an arrangement similar to that seen in T6SSs and analyzed the resulting purified PVCs with negative-stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We identified nascent densities at the base of each PVC particle likely corresponding to loaded Cas9 (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). Two separate densities were observed with a Pvc10 design carrying two Cas9 domains (Cas9–Pvc10–Cas9), and three were observed when Cas9 was fused to the trimeric Pvc8 (Pvc8–Cas9), confirming that these densities likely corresponded to Cas9 cargos loaded onto the spike complex.

Although we previously demonstrated that Cas9 could be loaded into PVCs internally (via the tube)13, we were unable to load Cas9 in the complex with single guide RNA (sgRNA), likely because cargos are unfolded during loading into the tube21. However, our TEM results in Fig. 1c suggested that cargos loaded onto the spike complex remain folded; therefore, we sought to test if we could use this method to load and deliver Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). We found that PVCs harboring Pvc8/Pvc10–Cas9 fusions, when coexpressed with sgRNA, purified with an approximately five-log enrichment of sgRNA over PVCs harboring unmodified spike complexes (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1f). Furthermore, when these PVCs (carrying an Ad5 knob domain in Pvc13 to allow for targeting of human cells13, used in all live-cell experiments in this work unless specified otherwise) were added to HEK293FT cells, we observed on-target insertions and deletions (indels) without co-transfection of sgRNA (Fig. 1e,f and Extended Data Fig. 1g,h), indicating that Cas9 RNPs loaded onto the PVC spike are also functionally delivered. Finally, we also found that spike-based cargo loading can be combined with tube-based cargo loading, enabling the delivery of both halves of a two-component base editing system (the zinc finger deaminase (ZFD)22) by a single PVC design (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 1i).

In addition to delivering folded proteins and RNPs, Pvc10-based cargo loading may offer another advantage: because Pvc10 is an external component of the PVC and is not required for assembly of the full complex3, it might be able to self-assemble onto PVCs lacking Pvc10 in vitro, enabling loading of a wide variety of synthetic cargos (for instance, chemically modified cargos) that might be difficult to load in vivo (Fig. 2a). We found that separately purified Pvc10 protein readily assembles onto Δpvc10 PVCs in vitro, fully rescuing the activity of these particles (which were loaded with Cre internally13) against HEK293FT cells harboring a Cre reporter (loxP–green fluorescent protein (loxP–GFP); Fig. 2b). Furthermore, when Δpvc10 PVCs (lacking internal cargos) were incubated with Pvc10–Cas9 RNPs and added to HEK293FT cells, we observed on-target indels (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2a), indicating the feasibility of this in vitro cargo loading approach.

a, Proposed model of in vitro cargo loading via Pvc10. Pvc10–cargo fusions can likely load onto PVCs via an interaction between Pvc10 and the untipped spike (Pvc8). b, Incubation with separately purified Pvc10 protein in vitro rescues the activity of Δpvc10 PVCs (loaded internally with Cre13) in HEK293FT cells co-transfected with loxP–GFP. Activity of Δpvc10 PVCs complemented with Pvc10 in vitro approached that of unmutated PVCs lacking the pvc10 deletion. c, Δpvc10 PVCs incubated with Cas9 RNPs tethered to Pvc10 (Pvc10–Cas9RNP) in vitro produce on-target indels in HEK293FT cells. d, Proposed model of in vitro DNA loading via Pvc10. PVCs harboring an HUHe tag in Pvc10 are incubated with ssODNs containing an HUHe-specific recognition sequence, allowing for covalent conjugation of ssODNs to Pvc10, which enables spike-mediated translocation of ssDNA. e, PVCs loaded with ssODN HDR templates in vitro (as described in d) produce targeted 6-bp DNA insertions in HEK293FT cells following Cas9 genomic cleavage (conferred via pretransfection of a Cas9/sgRNA plasmid). f, PVCs can deliver DNA, RNA and protein simultaneously. PVCs loaded with Cas9 RNPs (as in Fig. 1e) and ssODN HDR templates (as in e) via a single multidomain Pvc10 design (HUHe–Pvc10–Cas9RNP) yield both indels and DNA insertions in untransfected HEK293FT cells. g, Proposed model of in vitro retargeting of PVCs using self-conjugating protein tags. PVCs containing ST or SNAP in the distal domain of the targeting element (Pvc13) are covalently conjugated to antibodies (scFvs or mAbs) labeled with SC or BG, altering the binding specificity of Pvc13. h,i, Endogenous toxin-loaded PVCs conjugated with an anti-HA tag single-chain antibody (scFvanti-HA) via ST/SC (h) or an mAb to CD3 (mAbanti-CD3) via SNAP/BG (i) kill human cells displaying the cognate binding partners for these antibodies (BJ–HA and Jurkat cells, respectively). j, PVCs retargeted in vitro are highly target specific, enabling programmable population editing. Toxin-loaded PVCs carrying Pvc13–ST were retargeted in vitro (as in g–i) with either an SC-labeled anti-EGFR DARPin (DARPinanti-EGFR–SC) or an SC-labeled anti-mouse MHC class II Nb (Nbanti-MHCII–SC) and were subsequently added to a mixed population of EGFR+ cells (A431) and MHC class II+ cells (A20). Retargeted PVCs selectively inhibited only one cell type within the mixed population. All values (b, c, e, f and h–j) are shown as mean ± s.d. with n = 5 biological replicates. Statistical significance was computed using one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post hoc test; ****P < 0.0001; NS, not significant.

Source data

We next sought to harness Pvc10 to load an entirely different category of cargos: single-stranded DNA (ssDNA; Fig. 2d). We fused an HUH endonuclease (HUHe) domain23,24 to Pvc10 and incubated the resulting Pvc10–HUHe PVCs with ~100-nt ssDNA oligonucleotides (ssODNs) containing both an HUHe-specific recognition sequence and a homology-directed repair (HDR) template designed to yield a 6-bp insertion in the human VEGFA locus (Extended Data Fig. 2b). After adding the resulting DNA-loaded PVCs to HEK293FT cells pretransfected with a Cas9/sgRNA plasmid, we observed the intended insertions at this locus (Fig. 2e). In addition, PVCs loaded with both Cas9 RNPs (via C-terminal fusion of Cas9 to Pvc10, as in Fig. 1c–f) and HUHe–ssODNs (via N-terminal fusion of HUHe to Pvc10 followed by in vitro conjugation of ssODNs, as in Fig. 2e) produced both Cas9-mediated indels and ssODN-mediated DNA insertions in untransfected HEK293FT cells (Fig. 2f), indicating that PVCs can deliver Cas9 RNPs and ssDNA HDR templates simultaneously via a single multidomain Pvc10 fusion.

To further extend the utility of PVCs for delivery, we sought to expand the breadth of cell types targetable by this system. Previously, we showed that small binding proteins, such as DARPins and nanobodies (Nbs), could be genetically inserted into the targeting element (Pvc13); however, larger targeting proteins (such as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)) were incompatible with this strategy. To overcome this limitation, we inserted bioconjugation tags (SpyTag (ST) or SNAP-tag (SNAP)) into the distal binding domain of Pvc13, enabling us to covalently conjugate Pvc13 to full-sized antibodies (scFvs and mAbs) containing SpyCatcher (SC)25,26 or benzylguanine (BG)27 in vitro (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). When PVCs harboring Pvc13–ST or Pvc13–SNAP were incubated with an anti-HA tag scFv fused to SC (scFvanti-HA–SC) or an mAb to CD3 labeled with BG (mAbanti-CD3–BG), respectively, we observed robust delivery activity in human cells displaying appropriate binding partners for these antibodies (BJ stably displaying HA tag (BJ–HA) or Jurkat cells, respectively; Fig. 2h,i and Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). Because the majority of publicly available binding proteins specific for human cell surface receptors are mAbs and scFvs, this result greatly expands the cell types and tissues targetable by PVCs.

We next asked whether PVCs retargeted in vitro retain the high level of target specificity observed previously with retargeted PVCs13. Using the ST/SC retargeting method, we conjugated toxin-loaded PVCs with either of two different binding domains, the anti-mouse MHC class II Nb VHH7 (Nbanti-MHCII)28 or the anti-human EGFR DARPin E01 (DARPinanti-EGFR)29, and applied the resulting retargeted PVCs to an approximately 1:1 coculture of cells expressing either mouse MHC class II (A20) or human EGFR (A431). We found that each PVC treatment selectively depleted only a single subset of cells within the mixed population: PVCs conjugated with Nbanti-MHCII selectively inhibited A20 cells, and PVCs functionalized with DARPinanti-EGFR selectively inhibited A431 cells (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 3e–g). In addition, after systemic administration of similar anti-mouse MHC class II-targeting PVCs (conjugated with Nbanti-MHCII) into mice, we observed a roughly 7% bulk depletion of MHC class II+ cells in the mouse spleen without significant impact on off-target cell populations (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c) and with only minor neutralizing immunity (Extended Data Fig. 4d), indicating that PVCs functionalized in vitro can be leveraged to specifically target defined cell types in vivo. This could be useful for delivery applications targeting circulating immune cells; for instance, reprogramming B cells for sustained therapeutic production30.

Finally, we tested whether Pvc8/Pvc10-based in vitro cargo loading (Fig. 2a–f) and ST/SC-based in vitro retargeting (Fig. 2g–j) can be combined into a single in vitro complementation reaction (Extended Data Fig. 5a). We found that when PVCs lacking both a cargo and a targeting moiety (Δpvc10/Pvc13–ST) were incubated with separately purified Pvc10–Cas9RNP and Ad5 knob–SC, the resulting reprogrammed PVCs produced on-target edits in HEK293FT cells (Extended Data Fig. 5b), indicating that these particles were equipped with both a cargo and a targeting moiety in vitro. Overall, this study demonstrates that PVCs can be modularly functionalized with a variety of cargos (including protein, RNPs, ssDNA and multidomain cargos; Figs. 1c–g and 2a–f) and cell-type-specific binding proteins (including scFvs and mAbs; Fig. 2g–i and Extended Data Fig. 3), enabling target-specific delivery both in artificial mixed populations (Fig. 2j) and within live mice (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c). Due to the PVC's unique injection-based mechanism of action (Extended Data Fig. 1c), which is thought to operate independently of intrinsic cellular pathways for internalization or trafficking, this system is likely well suited for use in metabolically inactive or senescent cells or in nonhuman organisms that are difficult to target with existing tools (such as plants, fungi or prokaryotes). Together, these results establish SPEAR as a highly programmable chassis for biomolecular delivery with wide-ranging applications in biotechnology.

The wild-type PVCpnf locus was constructed previously13 and is publicly available as separate structural (pvc1–pvc16) and cargo/regulatory (Pdp1, Pnf and regulatory genes PAU_RS16570–PAU_RS24015) plasmids (Addgene, 198271 and 198272, respectively). Routine plasmid manipulations involved PCR amplification using KOD ONE polymerase (Sigma, KMM-101NV; 6-min extension time for structural plasmids and 2-min extension time for cargo/regulatory plasmids), assembly with Gibson Assembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs, E2611L) and either electroporation into EPI300 electrocompetent cells (Lucigen, EC300110; for structural plasmids) or transformation into chemically competent Stbl3 cells (Thermo Fisher, C737303; for cargo/regulatory plasmids). Novel designs were structurally validated with AlphaFold3 and visualized with PyMOL (2.5.2) and ChimeraX (1.8). A list of amino acid/DNA sequences for constructs used throughout this study can be found in Supplementary Tables 1–10.

PVC samples were obtained using a previous method3,13 with modifications. Briefly, one variant each of the PVC structural plasmid and cargo/regulatory plasmid were electroporated into EPI300 cells, after which colonies were inoculated into 5 ml of Terrific Broth (TB; US Biological, T2810) and shaken at 37 °C for 16 h. Starter cultures were then inoculated (at 1:100) in 500 ml of TB medium and shaken at 24 °C for an additional 48 h. Cultures were then spun for 25 min at 4,000g, resuspended in 22 ml of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5; Thermo Fisher, 15567027), 140 mM NaCl (AmericanBio, AB01915), 3 mM KCl (Sigma-Aldrich, P9541), 5 mM MgCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, M4880), 200 μg ml−1 lysozyme (Thermo Fisher, 89833), 50 μg ml−1 DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich, DN25), 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, 93443) and 1× Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (MedChem Express, HY-K0010)) and subsequently shaken at 37 °C for 60 min to promote lysis. Lysates were then pelleted at 5,000g for 30 min at room temperature (RT) to remove bulk cell lysate. Supernatants were then spun in an ultracentrifuge at 120,000g for 1 h at 4 °C to pellet PVC protein complexes. Pellets were hydrated overnight at 4 °C in 1 ml of PBS (Life Technologies, 10010049), resuspended and spun at 16,000g for 15 min at 16 °C to remove residual solid lysate. Supernatants were then applied to 22 ml of cold PBS before repeating the ultracentrifuge spin (120,000g for 1 h) and resuspending in 100–500 µl of cold PBS (with the final volume depending on pellet size). Final resuspensions were again clarified at 16,000g for 15 min at 16 °C, and PVC yields were quantified by A280 measurement on a NanoDrop instrument (Thermo Fisher). For mouse experiments, endotoxin was then removed from the final PVC samples using a detergent-based method used previously13. All PVC samples containing spike–cargo fusions were used immediately; all other PVCs were stored at 4 °C for a maximum of 2 weeks before use. Long-term storage of PVCs was achieved by adding 5% (final concentration) glycerol to the PVC suspension and storing at –80 °C without flash-freezing.

Several proteins used to functionalize PVCs in vitro (such as the Pvc10–Cas9RNP protein used in Fig. 2c and all cargo/targeting proteins used in Extended Data Fig. 5b) were purified in isolation of PVCs using affinity chromatography. Plasmids carrying the desired open reading frames with N-terminal affinity tags (6×His-TwinStrep-Sumo) were transformed into Rosetta 2 (DE3) cells (Sigma-Aldrich, 71401M). Each colony was inoculated into 10 ml of TB medium and grown at 37 °C for 14–18 h before being inoculated into an additional 500 ml of TB. Cultures were grown at 37 °C until they reached an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6–0.8, induced with 1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (GoldBio, I2481C) and subsequently allowed to grow at 18 °C for an additional 16–18 h. Cells were then collected via centrifugation at 4,000g for 30 min, resuspended in 15 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5; Thermo Fisher, 15567027), 280 mM NaCl (AmericanBio, AB01915), 3 mM KCl (Sigma-Aldrich, P9541), 5 mM MgCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, M4880), 20 mM imidazole (VWR, IC102033), 1× cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, 11836170001) and 50 µg ml−1 DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich, DN25); 0.004 U µl−1 SUPERase-In RNase Inhibitor (Thermo Fisher, AM2694) if purifying RNPs) and passed twice through a Microfluidics M110P microfluidizer. Lysates were then clarified at 19,000g for 20 min at 4 °C, after which they were incubated with 2 ml of 50% Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, 30210; pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer) with shaking for 1 h at 4 °C. Following incubation, Ni-NTA beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000g for 3 min at 4 °C, transferred to a column (Thermo Fisher, 29922), washed with 10 ml of cold lysis buffer, washed with 10 ml of cold wash buffer 1 (40 mM imidazole in PBS; Life Technologies, 10010049), washed with 10 ml of cold wash buffer 2 (60 mM imidazole in PBS) and finally eluted with 2 ml of cold elution buffer (250 mM imidazole in PBS) for 5 min. The elution was collected, suspended in excess cold PBS and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter unit (molecular weight cutoff of 10 kDa or 50 kDa; Sigma-Aldrich, UFC9050). Purified protein yield was quantified by measuring A280 on a NanoDrop instrument (Thermo Fisher). For cargos containing sgRNA, 1 U µl−1 SUPERase-In was also added to prevent RNase activity. To remove the 6×His-TwinStrep tag, purified proteins were treated with Ulp1 protease (a gift from S. Vo, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard) at 0.4 mg of Ulp1 per 1 mg of cargo at RT for 1.5 h.

Several proteins used to functionalize PVCs in vitro (such as the Pvc10 protein in Fig. 2b, the anti-MHC class II/anti-EGFR proteins in Fig. 2j and the Ad5–SC protein in Extended Data Fig. 3c,d) were expressed using an in vitro transcription/translation (IVTT) system. The desired open reading frames were synthesized as gBlocks (IDT) containing 5′ and 3′ extensions required for expression in a T7-based IVTT system (5′ T7 promoter and ribosome binding site; 3′ T7 terminator) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. gBlocks were enriched using PCR with NEBNext polymerase (New England Biolabs, M0541), and the resulting amplicons were purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, 28104) and eluted in distilled water. One microgram of each purified amplicon was then spiked into PURExpress reactions (New England Biolabs, E6800; 50 µl final volume) and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h to promote expression of the desired protein. These reactions were then used as raw inputs for in vitro complementation reactions (see ‘In vitro cargo complementation' and ‘In vitro retargeting' below).

To complement PVCs with spike–cargo fusion proteins in vitro, 150 µg of PVCs was incubated with either 15 µg of affinity-purified spike–cargo protein in a 50-µl reaction (in PBS) or with 50 µl of a raw IVTT reaction containing a spike–cargo protein; these reactions were incubated for 1–2 h at 24 °C. For cargos containing Cas9 RNPs, 1 U µl−1 SUPERase-In (final concentration) was also added before the addition of cargo. Reactions were then diluted to 100 µl with PBS and purified with 100 µl of a 50% slurry (in PBS) of Capto Core 700 resin (Cytiva, 17548101). Reactions were incubated with resin for 30 min at RT with rotation, after which they were transferred to a filter plate (Harvard Apparatus, 74-5650) and eluted by centrifugation at 1,500g for 3 min. An amino acid sequence for an engineered Pvc10 construct designed to load Cas9 onto PVCs can be found in Supplementary Table 1.

To load ssDNA cargos onto PVCs in vitro, 150 µg of PVCs (containing Pvc10–HUHe) was mixed with 10 pmol of DNA (containing an HUHe recognition sequence: AAGTATTACCAGC; synthesized by Azenta) in a 50-µl reaction in HUH buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 8), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM MnCl2), which was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to promote conjugation of HUHe to the DNA cargo. Protein–DNA conjugation reactions were then purified using Capto Core 700 pre-equilibrated with HUH buffer before DNA delivery experiments in live cells. An amino acid sequence for an engineered Pvc10 construct harboring HUHe, as well as a DNA sequence for a representative HUHe-specific ssDNA cargo, can be found in Supplementary Tables 6 and 7.

To alter PVC target specificity in vitro, 150 µg of PVCs was incubated with either 5 µg of affinity-purified SC/BG-labeled binding protein (purified as described in ‘Affinity purification of spike–cargo fusions and binding domain–SC fusions' or provided by B. Lash, M. Segel and D. Strebinger, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard) in a 50-µl reaction (in PBS) or with 50 µl of a raw IVTT reaction containing a binding domain–SC protein (see ‘In vitro expression of spike–cargo fusions and binding domain–SC fusions'); these reactions were incubated for 1 h at RT. Retargeted PVCs were then purified using Capto Core 700 (see ‘In vitro cargo complementation') before experiments in live cells. Amino acid/DNA sequences for an ST-functionalized PVC tail fiber (Pvc13–ST), a binding domain–SC protein used to retarget Pvc13–ST and a DNA amplicon used to express a binding domain–SC protein via IVTT can be found in Supplementary Tables 8–10.

Loading of cargo domains onto Pvc8/Pvc10 was verified using immunoblots. Ten micrograms of purified PVCs (containing spike–cargo fusion proteins) was mixed with NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Thermo Fisher, NP0008) and NuPAGE Sample Reducing Agent (Thermo Fisher, NP0009), both to a final concentration of 1×, and were subsequently boiled at 95 °C for 10 min. The denatured samples were then run on NuPAGE Bis-Tris 1–12% protein gels (Thermo Fisher, NP0321) for 20 min at 200 V in 1× MOPS buffer (Thermo Fisher, NP000102) and were blotted onto PVDF membranes using an iBlot 2 instrument (Thermo Fisher). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at RT in blocking buffer (5% BLOT-QuickBlocker (VWR, 786-011) in 1× TBS-T (Thermo Fisher, 28360)), stained for 1 h at RT with mouse anti-Flag (Sigma, F3165; diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer), washed three times with TBS-T (5 min each), stained for 30 min with anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling, 7076; diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer) and washed another three times with TBS-T (5 min each). Finally, membranes were incubated for 1 min with chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Fisher, 32209) and imaged with a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc instrument. For ssDNA loading experiments, the Cy3 channel was also imaged alongside chemiluminescence. Pvc12 was used as a loading control for immunoblots; this protein was visualized via the addition of a C-terminal Flag tag.

Loading of Cas9 onto the PVC spike complex was visualized using negative-stain TEM. Briefly, PVC samples were diluted to 100–500 ng µl−1 in PBS and applied to a glow-discharged 200-mesh carbon-coated copper TEM grid (VWR, 100489-722) for 60 s before removing excess liquid with a light-duty tissue wiper (VWR, 82003). Grids were then treated with clarified 2% uranyl formate stain (incubating with gentle agitation for 5 s, 5 s, 10 s, 20 s and 20 s on five separate 30-µl uranyl formate droplets positioned on Parafilm) and allowed to dry at RT. TEM imaging was performed using an FEI Tecnai (G2 Spirit TWIN) microscope at 120 kV equipped with a Gatan Orius SC1000B camera located in the MIT.nano Characterization Facilities at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

To confirm the presence of sgRNA in PVCs loaded with Cas9 RNPs, we performed quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT–qPCR). PVCs were standardized to a concentration of 1,000 ng µl−1 and denatured by mixing with NuPAGE Sample Reducing Agent (Thermo Fisher, NP0009; 1× final concentration) and boiling at 95 °C for 10 min. These denatured samples were then used to generate cDNA using ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase (New England Biolabs, M0368) and random primers (New England Biolabs, S1330), according to the manufacturer's protocol. We then ran qPCR on the resulting cDNAs using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher, 4385612) in a Bio-Rad CFX Opus 384 qPCR instrument. A list of RT–qPCR primers used during this study can be found in Supplementary Table 11.

All cell lines were maintained in T75 flasks (Thermo Fisher, 156499) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in either DMEM-GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher, 10569044; for HEK293FT and A431 cells) or RPMI-GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher, 61870127; for A549 and A20 cells). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (VWR, 97068-085) along with 10 µg ml−1 gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich, G1397) and 1× penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher, 15140122) to prevent bacterial growth. A list of cell lines used in this study can be found in Supplementary Table 12.

To assess the activity of PVCs in live cells, we first seeded target cells into clear-bottom, 96-well plates (VWR, 89091-012) and allowed them to grow to ~80% confluence. A total of 7.5 µg of purified PVCs (into 100 µl of cell culture medium) was then added to each well. For some experiments, improved efficiency was observed if this dose was spaced over 3 days (2.5 µg per day). For experiments involving co-transfection, DNA was transfected using GeneJuice Transfection Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, 70967) either immediately after adding PVCs (for Cre reporter plasmids) or 6 h before adding PVCs (for Cas9/sgRNA or bdSENP1 plasmids; these transfections were followed by a medium exchange before adding PVCs). For ssODN delivery experiments, 1 µM (final concentration) Alt-R HDR enhancer V2 (IDT, 10007921) was also added alongside PVCs to promote HDR-mediated repair. For toxin delivery experiments, cytotoxicity was assessed using CellTiter-Glo 2.0 Cell Viability Assay (Promega, G9241) 24 h after adding PVCs; any wells exhibiting higher luminescence than the control well (PBS) were assigned a cytotoxicity value of 0% to avoid negative cytotoxicity. For assays involving Cre-driven GFP expression, cells were incubated for 3 days, imaged with a Leica DMi8 confocal microscope and analyzed by flow cytometry (see ‘Flow cytometry'). For gene editing experiments, cells were incubated for 4 days, genomic DNA was extracted with 50 µl of QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution (Lucigen, QE09050), and indels/base substitutions were quantified by next-generation sequencing (see ‘Deep sequencing'). All numerical data from the PVC experiments were plotted with Prism (10.2.2), and figures were graphically assembled in Adobe Illustrator (27.1.1).

Cells were first collected by incubation with 30 µl of TrypLE Express dissociation reagent (Thermo Fisher, 12604) for 5 min at RT, followed by resuspension with 50 µl of cold flow cytometry buffer (PBS supplemented with 2% EDTA (Life Technologies, 15575020) and 5% fetal bovine serum (VWR, 97068-085)). Samples were then run on a Beckman Coulter Cytoflex S flow cytometer, and analysis was performed using FlowJo (10.8.2).

To assess the target specificity of in vitro-retargeted PVCs (Fig. 2j), we instead used a modified protocol involving cocultures of two cell lines. Briefly, an approximately 1:1 mixture of A431 and A20 cells (1 × 106 cells each) was seeded into 2 ml of RPMI-GlutaMAX (with supplements listed in ‘Cell culture') in six-well, flat-bottom plates (VWR, 29442), 150 µg of in vitro-retargeted PVCs was added, and the cultures were allowed to grow for 48 h. The supernatants (containing suspension cells) were then collected and combined with adherent cells (collected in a similar manner as detailed in ‘Flow cytometry'), pelleted at 300g for 5 min, resuspended in 500 µl of fresh flow cytometry buffer to remove residual TrypLE reagent, immunostained with anti-mouse CD19–Alexa Fluor 700 (Thermo Fisher, 56-0193-82; 1:100 dilution) at RT for 30 min in the dark, washed with blank flow cytometry buffer three times and analyzed on a Beckman Coulter Cytoflex S flow cytometer. The flow cytometry gating scheme used during this experiment can be found in Extended Data Fig. 3g.

We used deep sequencing to detect PVC-mediated delivery of gene editing systems (Cas9 and ZFDs). We first amplified the desired target region out of each genomic DNA extract using NEBNext (New England Biolabs, M0541) and subsequently barcoded the resulting amplicons with indexed Illumina P5 and P7 next-generation sequencing primers. Libraries were purified with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, 28104), quantified on a NanoDrop instrument (Thermo Fisher) and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument. Indels/base substitutions were then quantified with Geneious Prime (2020.0.5). A list of primers used for deep sequencing can be found in Supplementary Table 13.

All experiments in mice conformed to guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health and were conducted under Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol 0017-09-14-3, approved by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Animals were chosen randomly for treatment with either control or experimental conditions without blinding. Female C57BL/6J mice (aged 8–12 weeks) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (strain 000664). All mice were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. A total of 100 µl per mouse at 1.2 µg µl−1 of either MHC class II-targeting or untargeted PVC in sterile 0.9% NaCl was injected intravenously. Animals were deeply anaesthetized 24 h after injection with CO2, and spleens of PVC-injected mice were extracted. Single-cell suspensions were generated by mashing through 100- and 70-µm cell strainers (Greiner One-Bio, 542000 and 542070) and repeated washing with PBS. Splenocyte samples were blocked with 1:50 TruStain FcX (anti-mouse CD16/CD32) reagent (BioLegend, 101320) before antibody staining for flow cytometry and stained with fixable viability dye eFluor780 (1:1,000 dilution; Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-mouse CD45-eFluor450 (1:100 dilution; BioLegend), anti-mouse CD3-FITC (1:100 dilution; BioLegend), anti-mouse CD19-APC (1:100 dilution; BioLegend), anti-mouse CD11b-PE-Cy7 (1:100 dilution; BioLegend) and anti-mouse IA/IE (MHC class II)-PE (1:100 dilution; BioLegend) at 4 °C for 30 min. Flow cytometry was performed on a Beckman Coulter CytoFlex S device with standard laser and detector configuration, and data were analyzed using FlowJo 10.8.1 software.

To assess whether mice mount a neutralizing immune response against PVCs following systemic injection, we used a serum neutralization assay. Briefly, we injected mice with either PBS (mock injection) or MHC class II-targeting PVCs (intravenously as described in ‘In vivo B cell depletion assay'), repeated the injections in one cohort at t = 7 days (to amplify the generation of neutralization antibodies), extracted serum for all cohorts at t = 14 days via submandibular bleed, incubated clarified serum with similar MHC class II-targeting PVCs (5% (vol/vol) serum and 15 µg of PVCs in each 100-µl reaction, diluted in PBS) for 1 h at RT and titrated the resulting PVC/serum mixtures on MHC class II+ cells (A20). Cytotoxicity was assessed as described in ‘Live-cell experiments with PVCs'.

All statistical analyses were performed in Prism (10.2.2). All quantitative data are presented as mean ± s.d. with n = 5 biological replicates per condition; biological replicates represent independent treatments in separate culture wells or mice. All images and blots are representative examples from n = 3 independent experiments. Statistical significance was computed using two-sided unpaired Student's t-test or one-way ANOVA, followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test (to correct for multiple comparisons), as indicated in the figure legends.

a, The wildtype PVCpnf locus—consisting of 2 spike genes (the spike (pvc8) and spike tip (pvc10), in blue) and 2 cargo genes (Pdp1 and Pnf, in orange)—was redesigned to generate PVCs which load cargo via the spike complex. Pdp1 and Pnf were deleted, and novel cargo domains were fused to either pvc8 or pvc10. b, AlphaFold3 predicted structures of engineered Pvc8/Pvc10-cargo fusions share similarity with similar complexes from T6SSs. The spike-cargo effector from T6SSTse6 (PDB: 4MTK/1TU114) was used as a reference. GFP was used as the cargo domain in AlphaFold queries for novel spike-cargo designs. Note that Pvc8 assembles as a trimer; thus, three cargo domains are present in Pvc8-cargo designs. c, Proposed mechanism of spike-mediated cargo delivery in human cells. PVCs harboring cargos fused to the spike complex (Pvc8/Pvc10) recognize target cells via the tail fiber (Pvc13), initiating a series of conformational changes which result in translocation of the spike—along with cargo domains tethered to the spike—across the membrane. d, PVCs can load exogenous cargos via Pvc10. Four arbitrary proteins (Cre, GFP, a nanobody (Nb), and a DARPin) were fused to the C-terminus of the spike tip (Pvc10), and loading was assessed using immunoblot on purified PVC complexes. Novel domains were only present in purified PVC samples when fused to Pvc10, indicating Pvc10 mediated loading of these domains onto the PVC complex. Baseplate (Pvc12) served as a loading control. e, Characterization of loading efficiency for novel spike-cargo designs. PVCs loaded with Cas9 were imaged with TEM (as in Fig. 1c) and the proportion of loaded particles were quantified (n = 250 for each design). Ambiguous particles were counted as unloaded. Zoomed-out images provided as context for the images in Fig. 1c. Scale bar, 100 nm. f, The RT–qPCR analysis from Fig. 1d plotted on a linear scale reveals differences in gRNA loading consistent with the observed variability of Cas9 loading from (e). Compared to the N-terminal Pvc10 fusion (Cas9-Pvc10), the C-terminal Pvc10 fusion (Pvc10-Cas9)—which also loads RNPs more efficiently—correspondingly loads more gRNA. The dual-Cas9 fusion (Cas9-Pvc10-Cas9) and Pvc8 fusion (Pvc8-Cas9) load the most gRNA, likely due to these designs harboring multiple Cas9 monomers per loaded PVC particle. g, Pvc8-mediated delivery of Cas9 requires the presence of Pvc10. Δpvc10 PVCs harboring Pvc8-Cas9 failed to produce indels in HEK293FT cells, indicating a functional spike complex is necessary for delivery of Cas9 in these particles. h, PVC-mediated delivery is dependent on sheath contraction. PVC-mediated delivery of Cas9 RNPs (as in Fig. 1e, f) was inhibited with PVCs harboring 5aa insertions in the sheath (Pvc2) previously shown to inhibit sheath contraction in other CISs32,33. See Supplementary Tables 4 and 5 for amino acid sequences of novel mutants. N.c., non-contractile. i, Longterm storage of PVCs. Tube-loaded PVCs (loaded with endogenous toxins Pdp1 and Pnf13; left) or spike-loaded PVCs (loaded with ZFDs, as in Fig. 1g; right) were frozen at -80 °C for 23 months and 12 months, respectively, and were subsequently incubated with HEK293FT cells to determine the effect of storage on cytotoxicity or base editing efficiency, respectively. Successful storage required the presence of 5% glycerol (v/v). All values (f–i) are mean ± s.d. with n = 5 biological replicates. Statistical significance was computed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test (f, h, i) or two-sided Student's t-test (g); ****P < 0.0001.

Source data

a, Pvc10-cargo fusion proteins self-associate with Δpvc10 PVCs in vitro. Pvc10 alone or with a cargo (GFP) were incubated with PVCs lacking Pvc10, purified using ultracentrifugation, and visualized with an immunoblot. Only intact Pvc10 or Pvc10-GFP successfully purified with the PVC complex after the complementation reaction; –Pvc10 variants of both (harboring a scrambled Pvc10 sequence) failed to purify. All proteins were tagged with FLAG; bands were visualized with anti-FLAG immunoblot. Baseplate (Pvc12) served as a loading control. b, ssODNs can be loaded onto the PVC spike tip in vitro. ssODNs (labeled with Cy3) were titrated against PVCs containing Pvc10-HUHe (tagged with FLAG), and protein-DNA conjugation was assessed using a dual Cy3/FLAG blot. Only ssODNs containing the 13-nt HUHe recognition sequence produced an increase in molecular weight in both the DNA and protein bands, indicating these species became covalently linked.

Source data

a, AlphaFold3 predicted structures of Pvc13-ST (grey) docked with various binding domain-SC designs (blue). Note that Pvc13 forms a trimer; therefore, three Pvc13-ST monomers and three binding domain-SC monomers were queried for each design. b, Pvc13 can be covalently linked with a novel binding domain using ST/SC. A DARPin fused to SC (DARPin-SC; tagged with FLAG) was incubated with PVCs harboring Pvc13-ST, and assembly of the DARPin/Pvc13 complex was assessed using anti-FLAG immunoblot. Assembly required both ST and SC in Pvc13 and the DARPin, respectively. Additionally, only the assembled DARPin-Pvc13 conjugate was retained in purified PVC fractions, indicating it was physically associated with the PVC complex. c, d, PVCs retargeted in vitro are active in human cells. PVCs loaded with Cre via Pdp1 (NTD) were retargeted with Ad5 knob domains in vitro (as was done with a DARPin in (b)) and exposed to HEK293FT cells co-transfected with a Cre reporter plasmid (loxP-GFP). Only particles resulting from an in vitro complementation reaction involving both ST and SC produced GFP activity. Images in (c); replicate data in (d). Scale bar, 200 μm. e, f, Individual validation of the retargeting moieties used in Fig. 2j. In addition to the Ad5 knob-SC used in (c, d), the anti-EGFR DARPin E01 (DARPinαEGFR-SC) (e) enabled PVC activity in EGFR+ cells (A431) and an anti-mouse MHC-II nanobody (NbαMHCII-SC) (f) enabled PVC activity in MHC-II+ cells (A20). In these experiments, we used Pvc13-ST PVCs loaded with toxins; PVC-mediated delivery was detected as cytotoxicity. g, Flow cytometry gating scheme for the co-culture experiment in Fig. 2j. All values (d–f) are mean ± s.d. with n = 5 biological replicates. Statistical significance was computed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; ****P < 0.0001.

Source data

a, Schematic and flow cytometry workflow for in vivo studies of reprogrammed PVCs. Endogenous toxin-loaded PVCs retargeted against mouse MHC-II via ST/SC-based in vitro retargeting (as in Fig. 2j) were injected into mice (i.v.) and splenocytes were subsequently analyzed for targeted depletion of MHC-II positive cells. b, MHC-II-targeting PVCs selectively inhibit MHC-II positive cells in vivo. PVCs injected into mice as in (a) produced specific cytotoxicity against the MHC-II+ cell population, including B cells, without significant reduction in the total cell population (CD45+) or depletion of off-target populations (myeloid APCs and T cells). c, PVC injections alter the cellular composition of the mouse spleen. Systemic treatment with MHC-II-targeting PVCs (a, b) reduced the total B cell population in the spleen by about 7% after 24 h. d, PVC injections result in minor neutralizing immunity. Serum from mice challenged with a mock injection (PBS), one PVC injection, or two PVC injections (at t = 0 and 7 days) were extracted at t = 14 days and incubated with equivalent MHC-II targeting PVCs to determine the effect of serum on PVC activity in MHC-II positive cells (A20). PVCs incubated with serum from mice challenged with two PVC doses exhibited a roughly 30% decrease in potency (IC50) compared to PVCs incubated with mock serum. All values are mean ± s.d. with n = 4 biological replicates. Statistical significance was computed using two-sided Student's t-test; ****P < 0.0001; ***P < 0.001; *P < 0.05; n.s., not significant.

Source data

a, Proposed model of dual-functionalization of PVCs via spike engineering and retargeting (SPEAR). Δpvc10 PVCs harboring Pvc13-ST were incubated with separately purified cargo (as in Fig. 2a–c) and targeting protein (as in Fig. 2g–i), yielding PVC complexes programmed to deliver defined molecular cargos into defined target cells. b, PVCs can be both loaded and retargeted in vitro. Indels were observed only when the cargo (Cas9 RNPs) contained Pvc10 and when the targeting protein (Ad5 knob) contained SC, indicating two separate functionalization steps occurred. All values are mean ± s.d. with n = 5 biological replicates. Statistical significance was computed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; ****P < 0.0001.

The election of US President Donald Trump last year triggered widespread concern in the US scientific community, but some researchers saw a glimmer of hope in the form of Michael Kratsios — the president's chief science adviser. Scientists who had worked with Kratsios during Trump's first presidency, from 2017 to 2021, had mostly good things to say when Trump nominated him in December: although Kratsios is not a scientist, he had previously shown support for science and a willingness to listen to and work with the scientific community.

Researchers also took it as a positive sign that Kratsios' nomination to lead the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) came early, and that he was given the official title ‘assistant to the president', which theoretically grants him easier access to Trump. Kratsios' predecessor from the first Trump administration, meteorologist Kelvin Droegemeier, arrived two years into the president's term and without such a title.

In the announcement in late December, Trump credited Kratsios' previous service as the US chief technology officer and his brief role overseeing defence research. Along with the announcement, Trump promised to “unleash scientific breakthroughs, ensure America's technological dominance, and usher in a Golden Age of American Innovation!”

Trump's science advisers: how they could influence his second presidency

Trump's science advisers: how they could influence his second presidency

Now, four months after his Senate confirmation, Kratsios is beginning to make his mark as he pushes the president's science agenda. Although some scientists and scholars are withholding judgement for now, many feel dismayed. In their view, Kratsios has done nothing publicly to defend science, even as the Trump administration slashes science budgets, terminates research grants and projects, fires government scientists and attacks universities. His public comments have typically reinforced the administration's arguments that science and academia, like government, have become liberally biased and bureaucratic institutions that need to be downsized and then jolted back to life.

In particular, Kratsios' first major initiative — a directive calling on federal agencies to promote ‘gold standard science' — has attracted widespread criticism for undermining and politicizing science. Most crucially, the guidance expands political power over sensitive science topics and questions of alleged research misconduct. When Kratsios defended the effort in an editorial in the journal Science on 24 June (M. Kratsios Science 389, 7; 2025), one of his predecessors, John Holdren, went so far as to publish a letter in Science accusing Kratsios of deploying Orwellian doublespeak to defend a proposal that will further enable the Trump administration's attacks on science. “And now the fox in the henhouse overseeing it all is Michael Kratsios?” wrote Holdren, a physicist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who served as science adviser to former US president Barack Obama. “What a charade!”

Holdren is not alone. “We were really hopeful that Kratsios would defend science, but it doesn't look like he is going to do that,” says Kenneth Evans, a science-policy researcher at Rice University in Houston, Texas. The question now, Evans adds, is whether Kratsios and the Trump administration will present a positive agenda for science. “Tearing everything down doesn't seem like a way forward.”

Kratsios declined multiple interview requests from Nature, and the OSTP declined to comment on the allegations in this article.

Kratsios earned a bachelor's degree in politics at Princeton University in New Jersey in 2008, but quickly moved to finance. In 2010, he went to work for the controversial Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, who runs a venture-capital firm with a focus on technology companies. Thiel is a critic of the modern science and innovation system and a long-time supporter of Trump.

Kratsios' early supporters credit him with pushing new strategic policies on artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing forwards during his first stint in the White House. They also say he kept the OSTP office running until Droegemeier was confirmed in January 2019.

“For two years, we had no director, and he was really holding down the fort,” says Tobin Smith, senior vice-president for government relations and public policy at the Association of American Universities (AAU) in Washington DC. Smith says the AAU's interactions with Kratsios were positive during the first administration, but says it's too early to say what the OSTP might get done under his watch this time around. “The verdict is still out.”

Unlike Droegemeier during Trump's first administration, Kratsios has not shied away from speaking out — and doing so in highly political terms. In his first policy speech at a conference in Austin, Texas, on 14 April, less than three weeks after his confirmation, Kratsios accused the administration of former president Joe Biden of leading with “a spirit of fear rather than promise” and “promoting social division and redistribution in the name of equity”. He then laid out a bleak assessment of US science, arguing that the US innovation system must be renewed to achieve “the Golden Age of American innovation”.

“As we look forward to America's 250th birthday celebration next year,” he said, “our progress today pales in comparison to the huge leaps of the 20th century.”

Several scientists who have worked directly with Kratsios expressed little doubt that he wants to promote science and technology, whether by reducing bureaucratic paperwork or introducing new funding models to encourage innovative research. He leans into areas such as AI, nuclear power and drones, and he wants to produce tangible change rather than written reports, says one scientist who recently departed the OSTP and requested anonymity to speak freely about their time with Kratsios.

“I do think he cares deeply about the American science and technology enterprise,” says the scientist, “but he's more of a technologist than a scientist”.

And that is precisely the problem, says Michael Lubell, a physicist at the City College of New York in New York City, who has studied the history of US science policy. Science advisers dating back to the Second World War varied by discipline and philosophy and served administrations of different political stances, Lubell says, but they were all scientists or engineers who could represent and speak to the research community. He says Kratsios' expertise rests with technology.

Trump's call for ‘gold standard science' has prompted an outcry: here's why

“He does not come from the science community, he does not know the science community and he does not understand the intellectual content of the science community,” Lubell says. “He is a mouthpiece for the president.”

Several scientists who have worked with Kratsios say he has a knack for picking up scientific terms and ideas, knowing his audience and reading the political terrain. It's unclear how he will balance competing demands in his current role. As science adviser and head of the OSTP, Kratsios needs to be responsive to the president's priorities while representing the scientific community's needs, says Gretchen Goldman, who leads the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and who worked on scientific-integrity policies at the OSTP under Biden. “Those two things are just fundamentally in opposition under this administration, so I don't see how Kratsios could win.”

Kratsios caught many scientists and policy specialists off guard with his first signature initiative: the gold-standard-science policy, which Trump unveiled on 23 May in an executive order that also repealed scientific-integrity policies put in place across the federal government under Biden. Kratsios followed up with guidance laying out nine core tenets, starting with reproducibility and transparency, designed to ensure that science conducted or funded by the government is “beyond reproach”.

Although the basic framing sounds reasonable at first, Goldman and others have raised a host of criticisms. One is that a guidance document on the gold-standard-science policy issued by the OSTP contains transparency language that seems to echo a controversial ‘secret science' rule put in place at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the first Trump administration (see go.nature.com/4fnb9pk). The EPA rule, which was blocked by a federal court and killed by the Biden administration, sought to require that the underlying data for science used in public policy be made publicly available, but critics argued that the policy could eliminate the ability of epidemiologists and other researchers at the agency to rely on certain types of public-health data that cannot be released owing to rules designed to protect individuals' privacy.

In July 2021, the River Meuse flooded catastrophically in the Netherlands and Belgium, killing 43 people and causing billions of dollars of damage to the local infrastructure. The severity of the flooding was unexpected because the river was considered safe after the implementation of a major flood-management programme, which involved widening the river corridor. Writing in Nature, Barneveld et al.1 report an analysis of the flood. They argue that a combination of uneven river widening and the specific characteristics of the riverbed triggered rapid changes in river morphology (the shape of the river channel) during the inundation. As a result, the effects of the flood were worse than they would have been had the river not been widened.

We developed a large language model-based framework to predict the magnitude of aging across diverse populations using unstructured and heterogeneous data. The predicted aging was highly correlated with multiple aging-related outcomes. Our research suggests that large language models can do more than generate text — they can also predict a person's aging status.

Mitochondria, the tiny organelles without which our bodies would be deprived of energy, are gradually revealing their mysteries. In a new study published in Nature Neuroscience, researchers from Inserm and the University of Bordeaux at the NeuroCentre Magendie, in collaboration with researchers from the Université de Moncton in Canada, have for the first time succeeded in establishing a causal link between mitochondrial dysfunction and the cognitive symptoms associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

Thanks to the creation of a specific and unprecedented tool, they succeeded in increasing mitochondrial activity in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, where they observed an improvement in memory deficit symptoms. While these are only initial results, they open the door to considering mitochondria as a new therapeutic target.

The mitochondrion is a small intracellular organelle that provides the energy needed by the cell to function properly. The brain is one of the most energy-demanding organs, and neurons rely on the energy produced by mitochondria to communicate with one another. Indeed, when mitochondrial activity is impaired, neurons do not have the energy required to function correctly.

Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a progressive impairment of neuronal functions leading to the death of brain cells. In Alzheimer's disease, for example, it has been observed that neuronal degeneration, which precedes cell death, is accompanied by impaired mitochondrial activity. However, due to the lack of suitable tools, it has been difficult in the past to determine whether mitochondrial alterations play a causal role in these conditions or are simply a consequence of the pathophysiological process.

In this new study, researchers from Inserm and the Université de Bordeaux, in collaboration with researchers from the Université de Moncton in Canada, developed for the first time a tool that allows to temporarily stimulate mitochondrial activity. They hypothesized that if this stimulation led to an improvement of symptoms in animals, this would mean that the impairment of mitochondrial activity precedes the loss of neurons in the context of a neurodegenerative disease.

In previous studies, the research teams already described the specific role of G proteins[1] in the modulation of mitochondrial activity in the brain. In the present paper, the researchers succeeded in generating an artificial receptor, called mitoDreadd-Gs, able to activate G proteins directly in the mitochondria, thereby stimulating mitochondrial activity. The stimulation of mitoDreadd-Gs in the brain led to the normalisation of both mitochondrial activity and memory performance of dementia mouse models.

"This work is the first to establish a cause-and-effect link between mitochondrial dysfunction and symptoms related to neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that impaired mitochondrial activity could be at the origin of the onset of neuronal degeneration," explains Giovanni Marsicano, Inserm research director and co-senior author of the study.

"These results will need to be extended, but they allow us to better understand the important role of mitochondria in the proper functioning of our brain. Ultimately, the tool we developed could help us identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for dementia and facilitate the development of effective therapeutic targets," explains Étienne Hébert Chatelain, professor at the Université de Moncton and co-senior author of the study.

"Our work now consists of trying to measure the effects of continuous stimulation of mitochondrial activity to see whether it impacts the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases and, ultimately, delays neuronal loss or even prevents it if mitochondrial activity is restored," added Luigi Bellocchio, Inserm researcher and co-senior author of the study.

A new study from Flinders University has revealed why forgiving ourselves can be so difficult for some - even when we know it might benefit our mental health.

The research, published in the journal Self and Identity, looked at the real-life experiences of people who feel stuck in guilt and shame after making a mistake or going through a difficult situation.

The study explored why some people struggle to forgive themselves, comparing personal stories from 80 individuals who either did forgive themselves eventually with those who felt they never could.

The study found that people who struggled to forgive themselves often felt that the event was still fresh in their minds, even if it had happened years ago.

They described replaying the moment over and over, feeling stuck in the past, and struggling with intense emotions including guilt, regret, shame and self-blame.

Professor in Psychology and lead author, Professor Lydia Woodyatt, says the findings show that self-forgiveness is far more complex than simply "letting go."

"Self-forgiveness isn't about just moving on or forgetting what happened," says Professor Woodyatt, from the College of Education, Psychology and Social Work.

"People who forgave themselves still thought of the events from time to time, and still sometimes felt shame or guilt, especially if they were in a situation that reminded them of the event. The difference was, the emotions were much less intense and frequent, and the event no longer controlled their life."

The group also made a conscious effort to focus on the future, accept their limitations (especially of knowledge, judgment, or control at the time), and reconnect with their values moving forward.

In contrast, the research showed that people who felt they had failed someone they cared for -- such as a child, partner, or friend -- or who had been victims themselves, often found it hardest to move on.

Professor Woodyatt says this challenges the idea that self-forgiveness is only for people who have clearly done something wrong.

"Sometimes self-condemnation, guilt and shame arise when wrong is done to us, or in situations where we feel a heightened sense of responsibility - even if there is no way we could control the outcome," she says.

"Emotions are a clue to what the brain needs to resolve in order to move on from self-condemnation. Emotions are the hurt that indicates the site of the possible injury if you will.

"In the case of shame, guilt and self-condemnation, this is about our brain helping to work through moral injury - that is core threats to psychological needs like agency (such as a sense of choice, control and autonomy) and our need for belonging (such as being an appropriate group member or relationship partner) and live according to those shared values."

The study also found that self-forgiveness is not a one-time decision, but a process that takes time, reflection, and often support from others.

Professor Woodyatt says the findings are important for mental health professionals who work with people dealing with guilt and shame.

"Helping someone forgive themselves isn't about telling them - 'don't feel ashamed for this, it's not your fault'," she says.

"It's about helping them understand where that shame or guilt is coming from, and working through those underlying psychological needs, moving from moral injury to moral repair - reaffirming their sense of agency and moral identity moving forward."

Criminologist and psychologist Dr Melissa de Vel-Palumbo says the study offers valuable insights for criminologists by revealing how people process guilt and responsibility -- key factors in understanding offending behaviour and rehabilitation.

"In this research we drew on real stories from people reflecting on painful experiences, some going back decades," says Dr de Vel-Palumbo from Flinders' College of Business, Government and Law.

"That gave us a unique window into how people actually live with guilt, shame and self-blame over time."

An American teenager is currently stuck in Antarctica after illegally landing his single-engine airplane in Chilean territory.

19-year-old Ethan Guo, who was in the midst of navigating a trip around the world when he landed at the world's southernmost pole, has been stuck in the icy region since June, according to the Associated Press. Upon landing, local officials charged Guo with providing them with “false flight plan information” and landing without authorization. Since then, he has been staying at a military base while he awaits movement on the court case, AP writes.

Unlike the exploits of many other influencers, Guo's stunt does seem to have involved a noble goal: the young American wants to become the youngest person to fly to all seven continents, while also collecting donations for childhood cancer research along the way. The teen's “Flight Against Cancer” has so far raised $131,000, according to the St. Jude fundraiser page associated with the effort. Guo has said that he hopes to raise over $1 million, which will go to St. Jude's Children's Hospital.

On Monday,  the charges against Guo were dropped as part of an agreement between his lawyers and Chile's prosecutors, the AP writes.  To avoid a trial, the agreement requires that Guo donate $30,000 to a children's cancer foundation within 30 days, the outlet says. He is also required to leave the country as soon as conditions allow, and he is not to return to Chile for a period of three years. Gizmodo reached out to Guo through his Instagram for comment.

At the time that he became stranded, Guo had already finished much of his journey, having traversed six of the world's continents, the BBC reports.

According to Guo's fundraiser, he originally began learning to fly when he was 13. He subsequently became interested in beating the world record for youngest person to fly to all seven continents. “Unfortunately, my cousin, who is the same age as me, developed stage 4 Hodgkin's lymphoma. As a young man, I watched the disease affect the people closest to me, such as my grandparents and aunts, little by little,” Guo wrote. “Since then, I decided to do what I could for Cancer research. In order to raise funds for research and international awareness, I decided that by breaking the record, I could get the necessary attention to influence and help as many people as possible who are suffering from the disease.”

It's unclear when Guo will be heading back to the U.S. He has said that, when he is released, he hopes to continue his trip around the world. “I remain in Antarctica awaiting approval for my departure flight,” the teen told the Associated Press on Monday. “I sincerely hope they give it to me soon so that I and my plane can continue with my original mission.”

In early 2023, David Petrou, a distinguished engineer and founding member of both Google Goggles and Google Glass, made a surprising move. After more than 17 years at the company, he departed to launch his own startup.

“I was seeing how fast technology was changing, and I felt there are certain ideas that are best explored in the context of a startup,” Petrou told TechCrunch.

His ultimate idea was to build Continua, a consumer-facing company that uses AI agents to enhance collaboration and interaction in group chats on SMS, iMessage, and Discord.

“The simple way to think about it is that we're bringing the power of LLMs to group chats,” Petrou said.

Continua announced on Tuesday that it has raised an $8 million seed round. The funding was led by GV, with additional participation from Bessemer Ventures Partners and a group of angel investors.

When developing Continua, Petrou noticed that people would interact with ChatGPT or another LLM, and then would copy and paste what they learned into their group conversation.

“If you and I are planning a trip, or if we're trying to figure out what to have for dinner, or what movie to watch, all of these things can be facilitated by an LLM participating in a group chat with us,” Petrou said.

Continua claims its AI agents can reduce group chat chaos by joining conversations and offering helpful information only when it's needed.

As the group discusses projects and common plans, Continua can automatically set reminders, launch polls, add calendar invitations, or generate Google documents with checklists and to-do lists.

If a user forgets details from the group chat, such as the meeting time or location, they can simply direct message Continua to privately ask for the information.

At first glance, Continua may seem like a straightforward application of AI, but Petrou says that getting LLMs to participate in a conversation with multiple humans is a rather complex technical problem. Since most AI models are designed for conversations between a single person and a single assistant, Continua had to fine-tune its technology to understand the dynamics of group chat discussions.

For instance, group members do not need Continua to respond to everything they write.

“You want the agent to have social intelligence,” Petrou said. He added that they had to “break the LLM's brain” to naturally integrate the AI into conversations.

Users can invoke Continua when they need its help or tell the agent to “hang back” if it's chiming in too often.

Users can get started with Continua by adding its phone number to a group SMS or its username to a Discord chat.

While several companies, including Meta and the startup Hey Umai, offer AI agents for conversations, Petrou insists that Continua is most suitable for group interactions.

Erik Nordlander, a general partner at GV, said his firm invested in Petrou even before the concept of Continua's group chat AI had fully taken shape. “David is a really brilliant engineer, someone who's been working with AI since before it was the hot thing.”

According to Nordlander, Continua has several potential paths to profitability. The agent is already assisting with event planning and trip booking, which he suggested they could charge for in the future.

In a moonshot move, AI search engine Perplexity has offered to buy Chrome from Google for $34.5 billion cash in an unsolicited offer, Reuters reported, and Perplexity has confirmed to TechCrunch.

Perplexity tells TC the terms of the offer include a commitment to keep Chrome's underlying engine, Chromium, open source and continue to invest in it. Perplexity's offer includes a promise to invest $3 billion into the open source project.

Perplexity is also promising not to change the user defaults of Chrome users, including the default search engine. That is, Perplexity is promising to leave Google as the search engine rather than making its own AI-powered option the default. 

Google could not be reached for comment. TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds. 

This bid comes after the Department of Justice proposed in March that Google be forced to sell Chrome after a judge ruled the tech giant acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search. Google has not agreed to sell Chrome and has vowed to fight the ruling. 

The Perplexity spokesperson believes the court will soon set terms for remedies, perhaps later this month. (Google is also fighting another federal case where the judge ruled it illegally monopolized adtech, and the DOJ is proposing Google be forced to divest two of its adtech products or otherwise break up its ad business.)

When the DOJ first proposed that Google divest Chrome, both OpenAI and Perplexity expressed interest in buying it. Given that Chrome is the dominant browser, with 68% marketshare according to Statcounter, if the court rules Chrome must be sold, no doubt others worldwide would want to bid as well.

Interestingly, the CEO of rival search engine DuckDuckGo testified in April that Chrome could be worth “upwards of $50 billion,” Bloomberg reported at the time. Should Perplexity's offer succeed, it could be considered a bargain. 

Still, this offer for Chrome is far more than Perplexity has raised from investors and more than the startup's current valuation. Perplexity has raised about $1.5 billion to date, PitchBook estimates, including an extension round of $100 million raised last month that valued it at $18 billion, Bloomberg reported.

In the meantime, Perplexity last month launched its own browser, called Comet, in its bid to grow its AI search business without having to serve its customers through a browser, particularly one owned by its main rival Google.

And, by the way, last month, Perplexity also reportedly submitted a bid to merge with TikTok.

"The current water shortfall situation in England now defined as a 'nationally significant incident.'"


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The UK government has instructed citizens to delete old emails and pictures to help conserve water, following the announcement of a "nationally significant" water shortage. However, the advice isn't up to snuff, as deleting emails and pictures should have no significant effect on water consumption, and might even make it worse for data centers that use certain types of evaporative cooling.

Guidance published Tuesday states "the current water shortfall situation in England is now defined as a 'nationally significant incident.'" Five areas of the country are officially in drought, with six more experiencing prolonged dry weather following the six driest months leading up to July since 1976. According to the report, rivers and reservoir levels continue to recede, and August isn't looking much wetter.

Naturally, the government is trying to encourage citizens to save water, and lists a number of very reasonable actions concerned residents can take to reduce their water usage. Measures such as collecting rainwater, fixing a leaky toilet, and using wastewater to water plants, alongside reducing shower times and not watering your lawn, can help reduce water usage. Finally, the article states, "Delete old emails and pictures as data centres require vast amounts of water to cool their systems."

As some onlookers have noted, the recommendation rings a little hollow when juxtaposed next to the UK government's commitment to turbocharge growth using AI. Perhaps more pertinently, the advice rings hollow because it's likely not very sensible. While it's true that data centers do consume large amounts of water through evaporative cooling (where it's used), the vast majority of this power draw comes from CPU and GPU computation, not the storage of pictures and emails. Once the data is stored, the storage devices generate very little heat and are often spun down (placed into low- or no-power states) and called upon only when needed.

The impact of an individual deleting emails and old photos on data center water usage is likely to be so infinitesimal as to be considered futile. In fact, rooting out old emails and photos and deleting them from your online archives might well use more energy and water than storing them in the first place, making this a counterproductive exercise.

Furthermore, if the data you're deleting to try and save water is stored in a data center outside of the UK, you'll actually end up saving water (or more likely not, as we've discussed) in some other country. The UK doesn't have universal laws mandating that citizen data has to be stored within the country, so this is a real possibility.

So if you're in the UK and looking to save water during this particularly dry spell, probably best to try some of the other options first.

Havium, a Seattle startup that helps people invest in and own single-family rental properties, raised $550,000 in a recent funding round as it continues to evolve its offerings.

Since launching in 2016, and being profiled by GeekWire in 2022, Havium has become a full-service platform that handles all of the operational burden associated with single-family rental (SFR) ownership.

Havium launched a full cash management service that handles all payment responsibilities — such as mortgage, taxes, insurance, utilities, HOA dues, etc. — for each Havium property, to insulate clients from such obligations post-acquisition.

Havium was founded by CEO Jamie Nacht, his wife Cristin Nacht, and former CTO Arash Motamedi.

Jamie Nacht said Havium has helped clients acquire about $40 million in rental properties to date and currently manages $25 million under its full-service model.

The company earns revenue by taking a fee on each client transaction and by managing the ongoing operations of each property. 

“We align directly with our clients — when they invest and their assets perform well, so do we,” Nacht said.

Havium operates in seven Pacific Northwest markets and expects to enter two or three new markets by the end of the year.

The startup has raised $590,000 to date, and the new round — funded entirely by angel investors — will fuel continued product development, backend infrastructure improvements, and geographic expansion, according to Nacht.

Amid the rise of new AI-powered low code developer tools aimed at hobbyists and non-technical folks, Uno Platform is doubling down on enterprise developers instead.

Montreal-based Uno Platform offers a suite of enterprise-grade tools for developers to build cross-platform .NET applications that can be supported on Android, Apple, Linux, and Windows systems. Users code an application once and Uno Platform makes it easy to ship other types of applications from the existing codebase.

“If you're coding something once and it works on five different platforms on desktop, web, and mobile, you're getting 5x the productivity already,” Uno Platform co-founder and CEO Francois Tanguay told TechCrunch.

Uno Platform is not the only app developer tool platform available, but Tanguay thinks it stands out in a market flooded by vibe coding platforms like Lovable and Cursor. For Tanguay, enterprise developers should have access to productivity tools too.

“Everything we are shipping hasn't been done before and we like we have a clear road map in terms of how we can add those extra capabilities make everybody 10x faster,” Tanguay said. “Nobody's capturing that market yet in the enterprise space.”

The two-year-old startup's enterprise focus has attracted customers and investors. Uno Platform just raised a C$3.5 million ($2.54 million) seed funding round co-led by AQC Capital and Desjardins Capital with participation from Scott Hanselman, the vice president of Microsoft's developer community, in addition to other angel investors.

The capital will help Uno roll out its premium tooling tier, Uno Platform Studio, and new feature, “Hot Design” which allows developers to pause a running application and change its user interface in real time.

Tanguay said they wanted to build Uno Platform to be as seamless to use and helpful as working with an consulting agency, which is exactly how the company got started in the first place.

Tanguay founded Nventive in 2008 as a consulting agency to build apps for companies right as apps were becoming the next hot technology. After a few years, Nventive started developing the suite of tools that eventually became Uno Platform because the agency was looking for ways to make itself more efficient, Tanguay said.

Nventive launched Uno Platform as an open source toolbox in 2018. The open source community could help the agency keep up with frequently changing operating systems that were constantly releasing new versions that required Uno Platform to tweak its offerings.

“We have over a hundred million downloads of platform, something we wouldn't have been able to do just by ourselves,” Tanguay said. “It was really betting on the open source, as a community, to help grow that initiative and bet that others would see the same value in having access to a toolbox like this.”

Tanguay was right and the company has more than 300 open source contributors. Nventive decided to fully spin out the tool box and created Uno Platform in 2023. Since then, the company has started working with enterprise customers, including Toyota, Microsoft and TradeZero, among others.

Just a week after OpenAI announced it would offer ChatGPT Enterprise to the entire federal executive branch workforce at $1 per year per agency, Anthropic has raised the stakes. The AI giant said Tuesday it would also offer its Claude models to government agencies for just $1 — but not only to the executive branch. Anthropic is targeting “all three branches” of the U.S. government, including the legislative and judiciary branches. 

The package will be available for one year, says Anthropic.

The move comes after OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind were added to the General Services Administration's list of approved AI vendors that can sell their services to civilian federal agencies. TechCrunch has reached out to Google to see if it plans to respond to Anthropic's and OpenAI's challenges in kind.

Anthropic's escalation — a response to OpenAI's attempt to undercut the competition — is a strategic play meant to broaden the company's foothold in federal AI usage. 

“We believe the U.S. public sector should have access to the most advanced AI capabilities to tackle complex challenges, from scientific research to constituent services,” Anthropic said in a statement. “By combining broad accessibility with uncompromising security standards, we're helping ensure AI serves the public interest.”

Anthropic will offer both Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government. The latter supports FedRAMP High workloads so that federal workers can use Claude for handling sensitive unclassified work, according to the company. 

FedRAMP High is a stringent security baseline within the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) for handling unclassified sensitive government data. 

Anthropic will also provide technical support to help agencies integrate AI tools into their workflows, according to the company. 

Anthropic, along with OpenAI, xAI, and Google, has been granted up to $200 million by the Department of Defense to leverage AI for national security, but the AI firm clearly hopes to integrate into a broader array of government work, including science research and health services. Anthropic noted in its press release that Claude is already being used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to accelerate scientific discoveries, and also by the District of Columbia Department of Health to help residents access health services in multiple languages. 

Anthropic says it is able to make such deployments because Claude “meets the government's highest security standards.” Aside from being certified for FedRAMP High, customers can access Claude through their existing secure infrastructure via partnerships with AWS, Google Cloud, and Palantir, giving them more control over their data. 

Anthropic's multicloud access could give it an edge in the competition with OpenAI, whose current official FedRAMP High offering is tied to Azure Government Cloud only. While Azure is widely adopted in government, some government agencies and security teams might prioritize data sovereignty, infrastructure control, and the operational flexibility a multicloud strategy offers. 

OpenAI is, however, actively working to reduce its reliance on Azure so it can embrace a more diversified infrastructure approach.

Longing for the nostalgia of watching home movies, like in the VHS days, but stuck with all your personal videos saved on an iPhone? Sure, you can AirPlay them to the TV, but the experience is not the same. This struggle inspired developer Devin Davies to create Cassette, a new iOS app that plays back videos in a format similar to VHS, making your iPhone videos feel more like old home recordings.

To use the app, you virtually “load” one of the tapes laid out across the screen by selecting the year's videos you want to view. The videos are labeled with what look like handwritten stickers with the year attached to the VHS tape's cover sleeve. 

You can then watch your life unfold on the screen with no further interaction required on your part. 

This lean-back experience introduces a new way to consume the media you have saved on your device, which is often left unviewed after the initial recording. 

The idea for Cassette was prompted by Davies' friend and fellow app developer Charlie Chapman, who is also a senior advocate at RevenueCat, a platform that helps mobile app developers manage in-app purchases and subscriptions. Chapman complained in a group chat about how watching home movies as a family today just wasn't the same as it used to be when watching old family videotapes.

He said he wished there was a way to AirPlay videos to the TV and then have them immediately play one after the other.

Davies, best known for his award-winning recipe app Crouton, jumped on the idea, hacking together Cassette from a custom slideshow app he had made for Apple TV. He later shared a test build with the group chat.

“I kid you not, the entire group chat had this profound experience with our partners where we stayed up all night watching our kids grow up before our eyes,” Chapman told TechCrunch. “I've never experienced ‘product market fit,' or whatever you want to call it, like this before,” he said. 

The app itself offers a clever and simple design, where you're presented with rows of VHS tapes, in all their retro splendor. You tap on one to virtually “load” it into the TV icon at the top of the iPhone's screen to start playing the video. With AirPlay, you can also mirror your device to a TV to watch the full experience play out on the big screen.

The videos themselves include a location, date, and timestamp displayed in a retro pixel font that looks like the old screen fonts used on VHS tapes. (Even if you're too young to remember VHS tapes, seeing old videos in this format pulls on the heartstrings. That could be because old home movies are still regularly referenced in modern movies and TV shows during sentimental moments and scenes.)

In practice, there were some challenges that the app still needs to overcome. 

If you have a habit of downloading online videos, like TikToks or Reels, these will show up among your “home movies.” However, Davies tells TechCrunch that the app is already filtering out screen recordings, and he's now looking to see if TikTok videos could be filtered out, too. 

To support its development, Cassette offers an optional premium subscription (dubbed “ColorPlus”) that allows users to manually select a VHS tape instead of having the app play a video at random. This costs either $0.99 per month or $5.99 per year. There's also an affordable Lifetime unlock for $7.99, which can go a long way toward supporting indie projects like this.

The app is a free download for iPhone and iPad.

The Allen Institute for AI released a new AI robotics system that uses novel approaches to help robots navigate messy real-world environments, while making all of the model's code, data, and training methods publicly available under open-source principles.

The system, called MolmoAct, converts 2D images into 3D visualizations, previews its movements before acting, and lets human operators adjust those actions in real time. It differs from existing robotics models that often work as opaque black boxes, trained on proprietary datasets.

Ai2 expects the system to be used by robotics researchers, companies, and developers as a foundation for building robots that can operate in unstructured environments such as homes, warehouses, and disaster response scenes.

In demos last week at Ai2's new headquarters north of Seattle's Lake Union, researchers showed MolmoAct interpreting natural language commands to direct a robotic arm to pick up household objects, such as cups and plush toys, and move them to specific locations. 

Researchers described it as part of AI2's broader efforts to create a comprehensive set of open-source AI tools and technologies. The Seattle-based research institute was founded in 2014 by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, and is funded in part by his estate.

Ai2's flagship OLMo large language model is a fully transparent alternative to proprietary systems, with openly available training data, code, and model weights, designed to support research and public accountability in AI development.

The institute's projects are moving in “one big direction” — toward a unified AI model “that can do reasoning and language, that can understand images, videos, that can control a robot, and that can make sense of space and actions,” said Ranjay Krishna, Ai2's research lead for computer vision, and a University of Washington Allen School assistant professor.

MolmoAct builds on AI2's Molmo multimodal AI model — which can understand and describe images — by adding the ability to reason in 3D and direct robot actions.

A new OLED gaming monitor seems to appear every week, with models ranging from 27 inches and larger, along with ultra wides and even the occasional jumbo screen. Asus has already populated its ROG Swift and Strix lines with these lovelies, and I have here the newest example, the XG32UCWMG. This bracelet-worthy character string refers to a 32-inch 4K panel that runs at 240 Hz, 480 Hz in FHD resolution, and includes FreeSync Premium Pro, G-Sync compatibility, HDR10 with DisplayHDR 400 and wide gamut color. Let's take a look.

The XG32UCWMG is a WOLED panel with a very glossy front layer. WOLED, or White OLED uses a single OLED pixel with RGB color filters. A micro lens array pumps up brightness to a claimed 1,300 nits for HDR content. The front layer is optically pure and still manages to prevent reflections from spoiling the image. Though it has the same infinite contrast sported by any OLED, this special glass delivers greater clarity.

The native refresh rate is 240 Hz in 4K, and you get a dual mode switch for 480 Hz at FHD resolution. If you're a frame rate junkie, it doesn't get much faster unless you go with a smaller LCD panel running at 500 or 540 Hz. This isn't the first dual-mode monitor I've seen, and in the comparison tests, I'll show you three more examples that produce some interesting results.

The one thing missing here is Quantum Dots, which are the way to an even larger color gamut. Most examples cover 110% of DCI-P3 or more, but the XG32UCWMG is no slouch in the saturation department. In my tests, it was just a hair less than 100% which is very colorful indeed. Accuracy is there too with no need for calibration. If your needs run to photography and video production, there are optional color space modes available.

The full suite of GamePlus options is here with aiming points, sniper mode, timers, frame counter and display alignment marks. The refresh rate switch can be done with two clicks once it's set up in Windows and you can program the joystick clicks to a variety of often-used commands. You also get LED lighting in the back with Asus' cool Lite-Brite ROG logo that lights up in any desired color. Asus' Display Widget Center desktop allows full control without the need for the OSD. Extensive screen care options include a proximity sensor that blanks the screen when the user leaves their desk and logo and border protection along with pixel orbit and panel refresh. Asus backs the XG32UCWMG with a three-year warranty.

The XG32UCWMG arrived packed with crumbly foam in its three component parts. The base is a new small footprint design that looks diminutive but is a substantial metal plate that is more than capable of keeping everything upright. The stand assembles with a captive bolt and snaps onto the panel. The power supply is a small external brick. The cable bundle comes in a nice, zippered pouch and includes USB and DisplayPort. You also get a microfiber cleaning cloth and a large sheet of Asus ROG decals.

The XG32UCWMG is impressive from the front for two reasons. One, that glossy layer is a real thing. From the moment you turn it on, you can see its superior optical properties. Clarity is extremely high as is color saturation. There are no Quantum Dots here, but honestly, it's hard to tell. The second thing I noticed was the super thin bezel. This is common with OLEDs, but Asus has managed to get the top and side borders down to just 8mm. The panel is super thin with a component bulge in Asus' classic two-piece design. The panel's minimum thickness is just 5mm with a metal backing. The bulge adds a bit of size, making the total depth 2.8 inches.

The back features a large ROG logo made from colored pixels that remind me of the Lite-Brite toy from the 1970s. It's a cool aesthetic that I've seen on many of the newest ROG displays. You can light it up in different colors and play effects like flashing and breathing. It can also coordinate with on-screen action when Display Widget Center is installed.

The stand is rock solid with a small base designed to minimize the XG32UCWMG's footprint. It looks small in the photos, but in practice, the monitor ain't goin' nowhere. It's an improvement over the very wide and deep leg-style bases from Asus' past. Just above the cable hole, you can see a small protrusion from the screen with a backlit ROG logo. Behind this is a joystick and two control keys. The left one is preset to make the frame rate switch. More on that later.

Ergonomics include 5/20 degrees tilt, 15 degrees swivel and 4.3 inches of height adjustment. There is no portrait mode. If you'd rather use an arm, a 100mm VESA mount is provided along with a substantial steel bracket; however, no fasteners are included.

The input panel is underneath in the usual position and splits on either side of the upright. One side has two HDMI 2.1 and a DisplayPort 1.4 with Display Stream Compression (DSC). The other side has USB 3.2, one up and three downstream ports and a USB-C which can replicate a second DisplayPort. Everything is supported by KVM functions in the OSD where you can bind USB and video ports together to control multiple systems from a single set of peripherals.

The XG32UCWMG's OSD will be familiar to any Asus ROG display owner. It's a high contrast design with red accents and white text on a black background arranged in a tree with nine sub-menus.

The XG32UCWMG starts with the Gaming menu and its collection of video processing and play aids. At the top is Frame Rate Boost, which is a simple toggle between UHD/240 Hz and FHD/480 Hz. You'll need to set it up once in Nvidia Control Panel for G-Sync systems or AMD Graphic Control for FreeSyncers. Then, it's just two clicks to switch between modes, first the left button, then the joystick.

The full suite of GamePlus features is included, with aiming points, six sniper magnifications, timers, stopwatch, frame counter (number or graph) and display alignment marks. GameVisual is Asus' term for picture modes and there are nine in total. Racing is the default and best choice for all applications and does not require calibration.

The Image menu has luminance control and a Uniform Brightness toggle. For most productivity apps, leaving this on makes the image more consistent and less fatiguing. When it's off, highlights become brighter, up to around 450 nits at maximum brightness. In HDR mode, it's even brighter still with 25% window patterns measuring around 735 nits and 1% windows topping 1,300 nits. Additionally, OLED Anti-Flicker prevents artifacts from creeping in during rapid frame rate changes. HDR signals get four dedicated picture modes and include the option to adjust brightness and contrast. Gaming HDR is the most dynamic option while True Black is the most accurate.

Color settings include selectable gamuts, sRGB, and DCI-P3. The latter refers to the DisplayP3 standard with 2.2 gamma and D65 white point. To calibrate, there are color temp presets and a user mode with RGB sliders. You can also pick from five gamma presets and adjust saturation for all six colors.

OLED Care options are extensive and include screen dimming, logo protection, pixel orbiter and pixel refresh. A front-mounted sensor can be engaged to turn the screen off when you leave your desk. To view two video sources at once, there's PIP and PBP with a single split option (50/50) and corner positions and sizing for the PIP window. The lighting in the back can be controlled with various colors and effects, or you can tweak it with Asus Display Widget Center app.

The joystick directions and selector can be programmed for the most-used functions, such as input select or GameVisual. The left button defaults to Frame Rate Boost, which is the easiest way to switch refresh rates between 240 and 480 Hz. Customized Setting lets you save your configurations for later recall. In the KVM menu, you can bind USB and video ports so multiple systems like a PC and console can be controlled from a single keyboard and mouse.

The XG32UCWMG's Racing mode is very color-accurate out of the box and can be enjoyed without calibration. The full color gamut will be used for all content, covering around 100% of DCI-P3. If you want sRGB, the best choice is to use the Display Color Space option in the Color menu rather than the dedicated sRGB mode because it retains all the image adjustment options. I made one change to the red slider but left gamma on its default setting. The table below shows my recommendations plus brightness values for Uniform Brightness on or off.

For HDR signals, there are four dedicated modes. True Black is the closest to standard but if you want maximum brightness in the highlight zones, choose Gaming HDR. It will peak at around 1,300 nits in a 1% window. Turning on Adjustable HDR gives you access to the brightness and contrast sliders, plus the Uniform Brightness toggle.

My first order of business was to set up the Frame Rate Boost, AKA dual refresh operation. I opened Nvidia Control Panel and set the max refresh rate for 4K at 240 Hz, then pressed the button for 480 Hz, then returned to NCP and set the refresh to 480 Hz. This only needs to be done once; then the XG32UCWMG will switch back and forth with two button clicks after a brief delay. I noted that HDR worked fine in either mode. I also noted that you can't switch while you're in a game. The resolution change plays havoc with the graphics, and I had to shell out to the Windows desktop to recover. Just pick your mode before loading the game and you'll be fine.

So, does it make a difference? The reduced resolution is certainly obvious when going from 138ppi to 69ppi pixel density. Yes, the frame rate increases greatly. In my case, running a GeForce RTX 4090 in Doom Eternal means 220-240fps in 4K and 350-420fps in Full HD. But at 220fps in UHD, there is no motion blur or perceptible delay whatsoever. Only a slower video card will benefit from the 480 Hz mode. The higher frame rate does nothing for the gaming experience when you can run over 200fps in 4K.

And that is a revelation, especially in HDR mode, where the image is just stunning. The XG32UCWMG's glossy front layer provides an obvious optical benefit. The picture is so sharp, I almost cut myself. Highlights are incredibly textural and bright, yet there is perfect balance over the entire dynamic range. I also did not miss the Quantum Dot color. The picture is so good that I can't imagine giving up that glossy screen for 10% more gamut coverage.

Of course, video processing is flawless. G-Sync operated perfectly, and I never saw any artifacts, stutter or blur. It really can't get better than this. Response is incredibly fast, and certainly quick enough for the highest levels of competition. On-screen movement almost seemed to anticipate my control inputs.

The XG32UCWMG is equally capable as a workday monitor. You won't find better image quality than OLED and this is one of the best. That is by a small margin, as I have yet to review an OLED I didn't love. This monitor does stand out a bit, though, with that glossy screen. I also appreciated the flexibility offered by Uniform Brightness. All OLEDs should have this feature, but many do not. I recommend turning it on for work and turning it off for gaming and entertainment. And HDR content should be viewed in the Gaming HDR mode. It's the most dynamic and textural of the four choices.

The XG32UCWMG convenience features like GamePlus's aiming points and KVM peripheral management are pluses for sure. The extra USB ports were welcome, and I enjoyed the LED feature on the back. My only wish was for internal speakers but donning a pair of headphones took care of that.

Takeaway: The XG32UCWMG is a premium monitor in every respect. Whether you want it for gaming or work or both, it delivers at the highest level of image quality and performance. It reinforces the mantra, “you never regret buying the best.”

A new ‘Guide to comfortable use of the store' asks café visitors to stop bringing in ‘Personal desktops, printers, power strips, partitions, etc.'

Seeing people pecking at their laptop keyboard while they cradle a latte will be a common enough sight at your local Starbucks in the U.S. However, some South Korean folk have managed to outstretch the limits of the coffee chain's hospitality. The Korea Herald reports that “every branch” of Starbucks in the nation has put up signs telling customers that bringing in their desktop PCs, printers, power strips, and even putting up office partitioning, is no longer permitted.

Local news reports suggest that the Starbucks customers with a penchant for bringing their home offices into the café are “a small but persistent group of clients.” The signs urge people to make room for their fellow coffee drinkers, and not to abandon their tech clutter at shared tables for long periods.





Of course, there's already a local word for these busy coffee shop table hogging folks. The Korea Herald says locals call them ‘cagongjok,' which it explains is a portmanteau word blending the Korean words for ‘café' and ‘study tribe.'

In our topmost picture, which the Korea Herald simply credits to social media (X), you can see that a particularly anti-social setup was spotted in a Starbucks in South Korea. We assume the image was originally shared for mirth-making and/or incredulous impact. Not only does this coffee shop visitor have a bulky-looking desktop setup (but where is the system unit?), but they have also constructed an isolating office pod to reduce distractions.

The source report suggests that other Starbucks cagongjoks have been spotted bringing printers, which are typically bulky, as well as power strips to feed their numerous electronics.

South Korea has enjoyed a “massive café boom” in recent years, according to Statistics Korea, which is quoted by the Herald. Latest figures show the number of coffee shops operating in the country have almost doubled, to 100,000, since 2015. It is pointed out that using cafés as study and workspaces has also grown quickly in popularity.

However, long-staying customers “can be costly for owners,” states the source. It cites an industry research institute that estimates a single coffee only covers 1 hour and 42 minutes of seat time before it becomes unprofitable.

Epic Games has just secured a win in its crusade against Apple and Google's app store policies: The Federal Court of Australia on Tuesday ruled that Apple and Google engaged in anti-competitive conduct when it came to their respective app stores, ABC News reported.

While Judge Jonathan Beach found that the two tech giants had abused their dominant position in the market for app distribution to limit competition, he rejected Epic's claims that the companies had engaged in “unconscionable conduct.”

Epic Games has been fighting Apple and Google's fee structure for in-app purchases in various jurisdictions around the planet. The company scored a major win against Apple this year in the U.S., and as a result, Fortnite returned to Apple's U.S. App Store after five years.

Tuesday's ruling could yield a similar result for Epic in Australia: The company's CEO Tim Sweeny said that the Epic Games Store and Fortnite would return to the Apple App Store in the country soon.

“We welcome the court's rejection of Epic's demands that we distribute app stores from within the Google Play store, and Epic's attacks on other critical security protections that users rely on. However, we disagree with the court's characterisation of our billing policies and practices, as well as its findings regarding some of our historical partnerships,” a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

Meanwhile, Apple told ABC News that its app store is the safest way for users to get apps, and that it disagreed with the court's ruling on some of Epic's claims.

A horrific shooting took place outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's headquarters in Atlanta on Friday. The shooting killed one police officer and left the building's staff locked down and terrified. The shooter, who unsuccessfully tried to breach the building, has been identified as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White. He was found dead at the scene.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has not been particularly good at navigating his high-profile position since taking office. His controversial beliefs and his unusual policies have made the bureaucrat a consistent target for criticism, and the events of this weekend proved to be yet another opportunity for Kennedy-related controversy to erupt.

Kennedy posted a public statement about the shooting over the weekend. Before he did that, however, Kennedy notably posted some pictures from a fishing trip to his personal X account. “Fishing the Kenae with Ninilchik Chief Ivan Encelewski Chairman of the Cook Inlet Tribal Council and Council President Gloria Oneil,” Kennedy posted on Saturday morning. Some 30 minutes later, Kennedy posted a statement to his official account expressing sympathy for the traumatized CDC staff: “We are deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at CDC's Atlanta campus that took the life of officer David Rose,” Kennedy wrote. “We stand with his wife and three children and the entire CDC family.”

It's worth noting that public figures aren't always personally responsible for the posts on their social media accounts. It's unclear who is running Kennedy's socials but, whoever they are, they dropped the ball here. Gizmodo reached out to the HHS for comment. An HHS press release published Monday afternoon said that Kennedy had visited the CDC campus where the attack took place and later “met privately with the widow of Officer David Rose, who courageously gave his life in the line of duty.” The statement says that Kennedy “offered his deepest condolences and reaffirmed the agency's commitment to honoring Officer Rose's bravery, sacrifice, and service to the nation.” Kennedy also reached out to staff on Saturday, not long after the shooting took place.

Kennedy's questionable social media choices aren't the only thing he has been criticized for in the wake of the shooting, however. White is alleged to have been preoccupied with the covid-19 vaccine which, according to MSNBC, he “blamed for his health problems,” an assertion that was previously corroborated by CNN's sources. Kennedy has notably spread skepticism about vaccines and fanned the flames of conspiracy theory around the covid pandemic. Several medical organizations recently sued Kennedy over changes he made to the government's vaccination recommendations. When it comes to the recent shooting, NPR has reported that some laid-off CDC employees have even said that “Kennedy shares responsibility for the violence and should resign.”

Kennedy's leadership at the HHS has been subject to ongoing criticism. The MAHA zealot has pursued various fringe agendas (like removing synthetic dyes from cereal and other processed foods and reintroducing tallow into french fries) while moving to cut funding, staffing, and resources to arguably much more important initiatives—including mRNA vaccine development, cancer research, and other vital health programs. Earlier this year, the HHS conducted layoffs at the CDC that reportedly impacted thousands of workers, although some of those workers have since been invited back to the agency.

Plus: the US has paused China tariffs again

This is today's edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology.

Meet the early-adopter judges using AI

The propensity for AI systems to make mistakes that humans miss has been on full display in the US legal system as of late. The follies began when lawyers submitted documents citing cases that didn't exist. Similar mistakes soon spread to other roles in the courts. Last December, a Stanford professor submitted sworn testimony containing hallucinations and errors in a case about deepfakes, despite being an expert on AI and misinformation himself.Now, judges are experimenting with generative AI too. Some believe that with the right precautions, the technology can expedite legal research, summarize cases, draft routine orders, and overall help speed up the court system, which is badly backlogged in many parts of the US. Are they right to be so confident in it? Read the full story.

What you may have missed about GPT-5

OpenAI's new GPT-5 model was supposed to give a glimpse of AI's newest frontier. It was meant to mark a leap toward the “artificial general intelligence” that tech's evangelists have promised will transform humanity for the better. 

Against those expectations, the model has mostly underwhelmed. But there's one other thing to take from all this. Among other suggestions for potential uses of its models, OpenAI has begun explicitly telling people to use them for health advice. It's a change in approach that signals the company is wading into dangerous waters. Read the full story.

One more thing

The search for extraterrestrial life is targeting Jupiter's icy moon EuropaEuropa, Jupiter's fourth-largest moon, is nothing like ours. Its surface is a vast saltwater ocean, encased in a blanket of cracked ice, one that seems to occasionally break open and spew watery plumes into the moon's thin atmosphere.For these reasons, Europa captivates planetary scientists. All that water and energy—and hints of elements essential for building organic molecules —point to another extraordinary possibility. Jupiter's big, bright moon could host life.They may eventually get some answers thanks to Europa Clipper, scheduled to reach Jupiter in 2030. Read the full story.

Asus and Noctua have finally launched their fifth collaborative graphics card, the GeForce RTX 5080 Noctua Edition, originally teased at Computex 2025. Following prior models based on the RTX 30 and 40 series, this new iteration introduces a significant redesign that includes the first-ever triple 120x25mm fan setup on a gaming GPU, employing Noctua's next-generation NF-A12x25 G2 fans alongside a thoroughly custom-engineered heatsink.

The cooling system integrates an extensive vapor chamber with eleven heatpipes—seven 8 mm and four 6 mm, a notable increase from previous Noctua Editions, which typically featured fewer heatpipes and smaller heatsinks. This design aims to balance efficient thermal dissipation with minimized acoustic output. Our review of the Noctua Editiorn RTX 3080 already praised the design from back then, so we expect this to be even better. Check out the official introduction video, which goes over every aspect of the card in detail:

Noctua's new NF-A12x25 G2 fans incorporate advanced aerodynamic features such as Progressive Bend impellers and SupraTorque motors designed to maintain high airflow and static pressure in demanding environments like large heatsinks. The fans are deliberately offset in rotational speed—arranged in an A-B-A sequence with speed variations of roughly ±50 RPM—to mitigate acoustic phenomena like beat frequencies and periodic vibrations.

Asus' internal testing at a 360W power target using FurMark stress tests reportedly showed the Noctua Edition achieved GPU temperatures of approximately 57°C and VRAM temperatures near 52°C, with noise levels measured at 21.4 dB(A). These figures would represent a substantial noise reduction—about 14.5 dB(A) less—compared to Asus's own ROG Astral RTX 5080 variant, while maintaining similar or lower operating temperatures. When fan speeds were artificially limited to 500 RPM, the Noctua Edition remained the quietest option tested and maintained temperatures well below the GPU's thermal limits.



The card supports Asus' 0dB semi-passive fan control, which shuts off the fans entirely under 50°C GPU temperature, allowing for silent operation during light workloads. Additionally, there's a dual BIOS switch that enables users to toggle between a quieter fan curve or a performance mode emphasizing the lowest possible temperatures. Asus' GPU Tweak III software will allow further customization of fan curves and undervolting to fine-tune noise and thermal performance.

Physically, the RTX 5080 Noctua Edition is considerably larger than standard models, extending 385 mm in length and occupying nearly four slots due to the thick triple-fan assembly and enlarged heatsink. This size makes it incompatible with many mid-tower cases and necessitates careful system planning.

Clock speeds on the Noctua Edition are set with a boost clock of 2700 MHz, modestly above the Founders Edition's 2600 MHz but below some factory-overclocked variants, reflecting Asus' apparent focus on thermals and acoustics over maximum out-of-the-box frequencies. The card also features phase-change thermal pads aimed at improved longevity and consistent thermal performance, addressing issues like pump-out and dry-out associated with traditional thermal pastes.

Asus' collaboration with Noctua dates back several generations, with earlier models on the RTX 3080 and RTX 4080 lines gaining attention for their unique brown fan design and quieter operation compared to competing variants. Each iteration has gradually introduced refinements in cooling architecture and fan technology, culminating in the current RTX 5080 Noctua Edition's triple-fan configuration and advanced heatsink design. Noctua already makes some of the best coolers on the market, so this GPU should carry forward the company's reliable legacy.

While the card's technical approach delivers measurable reductions in noise and heat under stress, the tradeoffs include its considerable physical footprint and a boost clock that does not aggressively push performance limits compared to other RTX 5080 models. Availability and pricing for the ASUS GeForce RTX 5080 Noctua Edition have not been announced, but the card is available for £1,500 on Scan, that's about 50% more expensive than MSRP.

It follows state media-raised concerns about security and safety

Just hours after President Trump confirmed a new deal that will see Nvidia pay 15% of sales revenue to the government in exchange for H20 export licenses, a new Bloomberg report claims that China's government has been urging local companies to avoid using the chips for weeks. Nvidia has hit back and tells us its H20 chip is not for use in military applications or government infrastructure.

Over the weekend, reports claimed that the White House had struck a deal with both Nvidia and AMD that would see the companies share 15% of related revenue in China in exchange for export licenses of previously restricted chips, the H20 and MI308, respectively. Since then, President Trump has confirmed the deal and even hinted that he may permit Nvidia to ship more potent Blackwell AI processors, providing they are nerfed in some regard.

Despite the perceived boon to Nvidia in securing H20 licenses, Bloomberg says that China "has urged local companies to avoid using Nvidia Corp.'s H20 processors," especially for government-related purposes, in a potential blow to the company. According to the report, Chinese authorities have sent notices to firms over the past few weeks "discouraging use of the less-advanced semiconductors." The report comes from "people familiar with the matter," and cannot be verified at this stage; however, Bloomberg claims the information comes from interviews with "more than a half-dozen people." A similar FT report on Tuesday echoes the development, stating that Beijing is demanding tech companies justify orders of H20 chips instead of domestic alternatives.

The report claims that particularly strong guidance was issued around the use of the H20 chip for government and national security-related work by both state enterprises and private companies. It also briefly mentions that AMD AI accelerators, presumably the aforementioned MI308, are also thought to have been included in the push. According to the report, some letters from the state to companies included a series of questions asking why entities would buy Nvidia H20 chips over local alternatives, "whether that's a necessary choice given domestic options, and whether they've found any security issues in the Nvidia hardware."

The concerns reflect recent reports that Chinese state media is pushing the line that H20 GPUs are unsafe and outdated. One state-linked social media account wrote on WeChat, "When a type of chip is neither environmentally friendly, nor advanced, nor safe, as consumers, we certainly have the option not to buy it."

Bloomberg claims that the most stringent guidance relates only to sensitive applications, in the same way that Tesla vehicles and iPhones are restricted in certain places in the country. However, at least one source reportedly told the publication that the guidance could be extended.

In a statement, Nvidia told Tom's Hardware: "As both governments recognize, the H20 is not a military product or for government infrastructure. China has ample supply of domestic chips to meet its needs. It won't and never has relied on American chips for government operations, just like the U.S. government would not rely on chips from China. Banning the sale of H20 in China would only harm U.S. economic and technology leadership with zero national security benefit." The statement, while addressing China's concerns, seems strange, given that China's reported move against H20 would clearly be motivated, at least in part, by a desire to erode U.S. economic and technology leadership.

As mentioned, the state media concerns were fairly nebulous, simply touting the H20 as unsafe and bad for the environment. More specifically, Bloomberg claims that China's concerns center around location-tracking and remote shutdown of chips, coupled with a broader concern about shifting reliance away from Western offerings. According to Bloomberg, Chinese officials "are worried that Nvidia chips could have location-tracking and remote shutdown capabilities," something Nvidia strenuously denies. In a recent article, Nvidia denounced claims that any of its hardware contains backdoors or kill switches, and vehemently opposed their use in principle. As the report notes, Washington has floated the idea of using georestrictions, including software and hardware-based solutions, to combat chip smuggling.

On the broader note of supply, Bloomberg notes "Beijing is intensely focused on developing its domestic chip capabilities," and cites officials urging Chinese companies to pick homegrown semiconductors.

If China is indeed going on the offensive, urging local companies to steer clear of H20 chips, that could complicate the picture for Nvidia in the region somewhat. Despite initial indications that Nvidia was sitting on enough H20 chips to meet renewed demand — CEO Jensen Huang stated the company would not restart production — a report in late July claimed Nvidia was seeking an extra 300,000 units to meet demand. 

The FT reports that some tech companies are reportedly planning to downsize their oders of H"0 chip following questions from regulators.

REDMOND, Wash. — The first crewed flight around the moon in more than 50 years is still months away, but NASA is already saying thank you to L3Harris Technologies' Aerojet Rocketdyne segment and other suppliers who are making the trip possible.

Today, NASA's road trip brought agency officials — plus astronaut Woody Hoburg — to the L3Harris facility in Redmond, which has contributed propulsion systems to NASA missions ranging from space shuttle flights to the Voyager probes' journeys to the edge of the solar system.

Now NASA is getting ready to launch four astronauts on a round-the-moon mission known as Artemis 2, powered in part by hardware built in Redmond. Hoburg, who spent six months on the International Space Station in 2023 and is awaiting his next crew assignment, told an audience of about 200 L3Harris employees and VIPs that the Artemis 2 crew is well aware of the company's contribution.

“They're depending on you, and they know they can count on you,” he said. “Thank you for all the hard work you're doing to make this amazing adventure possible.”

The Artemis 2 mission is currently targeted for launch next April, or perhaps even earlier, said Howard Hu, NASA's program manager for the Orion crew vehicle. The mission after that, Artemis 3, is due to lift off no earlier than mid-2027 with the goal of landing astronauts on the lunar surface for the first time since Apollo 17 in 1972.

L3Harris' Aerojet Redmond team delivered the hardware for those two Artemis missions — including auxiliary engines for Orion's European-built service module — years ago. Now the team is working on thrusters for missions as far out as Artemis 8, which is scheduled to go the moon no earlier than 2033.

With the advent of the Trump administration and new management at NASA, the long-term plan for crewed moon missions has been in flux. 

The White House initially sought to cancel the Space Launch System and Orion programs after Artemis 3, and instead focus on a commercial alternative for Mars missions, such as SpaceX's Starship launch system. But Congress voted to stay the course — and Don Mahr, director of program management at L3Harris' Redmond facility, told GeekWire that NASA has told its suppliers to continue executing the current plan, at least for now.

Amit Kshatriya, NASA's deputy associate administrator for the Moon to Mars Program, said propulsion systems from L3Harris will continue to be essential components in NASA's toolbox even if the long-term plan for Artemis changes. 

“It's the wrong argument to think about picking one thing or another,” he said. “The right argument is, how do we stimulate and create missions and capability across the country in all sorts of different capability classes.”

Kshatriya said that NASA's needs are almost certain to change “five years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now,” and that L3Harris has demonstrated it'll be able to keep up.

“A shop like this is the DNA that we need to keep going, which is why we're so excited to be here,” he said.

Hoburg is excited as well. “We're using the moon as a proving ground to figure out how to get to Mars, so it's a really exciting time,” he said. “And the Artemis 2 crew that's embarking on this mission, they're the pathfinders that are starting a sequence of missions. … It's going to be the next step in space.”

Does Hoburg want to go to the moon? His answer was diplomatic. “I want the United States of America to go to the moon,” he told GeekWire. “It is time to do it. I would love to get to fly one of those missions myself, but I'm proud of our country that we're leading and executing these missions.”

During today's thank-you gathering in Redmond, four L3Harris Aerojet employees received awards from NASA for their contributions to the Artemis program. Brett Mendenhall and Richard Mirabella were given NASA's Silver Snoopy Award, which must be pinned onto the winner's lapel by an astronaut. “That was the part where I try not to draw any blood,” Hoburg quipped.

Camille Samonte received the NASA Space Flight Awareness Trailblazer Award, and Cory Houck won the SFA Management Award.

That shocking finale coda of Hwang Dong-hyuk's Squid Game series left many curious about what it meant for the American spin-off Netflix has in the works. When the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) pauses next to an alley in downtown Los Angeles, you witness, along with him, the Squid Game recruitment ritual being administered by a new face: Cate Blanchett, wearing a suit and offering up the Ddakji slaps.

It's hard to believe the Academy Award-winning actress was only recruited for a one-off cameo right after she claimed to be retired. In an interview with Variety, Blanchett discussed how the guest role came to be and what it might mean for her future in the franchise. “Because it's such a cult series and they were shooting in L.A. of all places, everyone was on a need-to-know basis,” she said of the “out of the blue offer” that stipulated she bring her own suit.

“I got a couple of storyboards. I had to [learn to] play the game very quickly. I had to practice and practice. I knew there were four or five setups that they were going to do, and I knew what they needed from every shot, and then I was given the sides. But it was one of the more mysterious jobs.”

Blanchett explained that while her role was a feature on the series finale, she'd consider returning. “I am wildly open to anything,” she shared with the trade, “and in a world that is so beautifully, magically created like that, for sure. They're amazing world-builders, and that series has been eaten alive. I don't think there's a corner of the globe that it hasn't touched in some way.”

What's so playfully suspicious about her answers is that Netflix has enlisted David Fincher for his take on the American Squid Game spin-off. And he happens to be a filmmaker Blanchett worked with on The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, so what gives? Nothing, apparently, just coincidence. The actress affirmed to Variety, “I mean, I'd love to work with David again. It's been ages. But no, I don't know anything more than you do. I'm not being coy. I really don't.”

In this interview, News Medical‑Life Sciences speaks with  Dr. Todd Bauman, Senior Director of Supply Chain, and Chris Povich, Vice President of Automation, at Ascential Medical & Life Sciences about right shoring in life sciences and how medical manufacturers are aligning supply chain strategy with cost, risk, and resilience in today's complex global environment.

Todd Bauman: I'm Dr. Todd Bauman, Senior Director of Supply Chain at Ascential, where I lead strategy focused on cost control, operational risk reduction, and long‑term value across our global medical and life sciences manufacturing network.

Chris Povich: I'm Chris Povich, Vice President of Automation. My role is to support our customers in automating production systems, helping them mitigate risk and scale efficiently across regions while maintaining compliance and quality in medical manufacturing.

Todd: Right shoring is not just a choice between offshoring and reshoring. It's about aligning your supply chain footprint with your business goals, customer needs, and external pressures such as tariffs or labor shortages. It takes into account the total cost, risk exposure, and resilience over time.

Todd: Cost miscalculations, geopolitical instability, long lead times, and inventory shocks—like we saw during COVID—are major drivers. Ethical sourcing concerns and public perception also play a role. Supply chains optimized purely for labor cost are increasingly exposed.

Chris: Automation is essential, especially when reshoring to higher labor-cost regions. By investing in automation, companies can reduce labor dependence, increase throughput, and improve quality. It also helps speed up workforce training and enables faster scaling of duplicate lines across geographies.

Todd: We've implemented a regional supply model—leveraging Central American suppliers for Costa Rica, European suppliers for Ireland, and Asian suppliers for Singapore and Malaysia. This reduces logistics risk, regulatory hurdles, and increases resilience by localizing supply where we manufacture.

Chris: The two options—line transfer or duplication—come with complexity. Duplicating a line requires reevaluation of obsolete components and sourcing constraints. Labor cost and skill shortages may make full transfers costly, so automation often becomes a necessary investment. Timeline, compliance, and capital cost are all key factors.

Todd: Landed cost looks at transport and tariffs, but TCO includes overhead, warranty costs, inspection, and reverse logistics. TCO offers a more holistic view, and when tariffs rise—as they have for aluminum from China—it often tips the scales toward reshoring or regionalizing.

Chris: Look for a global partner with mature local capabilities. They should offer deep engineering breadth, regulatory knowledge, and regional service support. This reduces costs, travel burdens, and improves time to market. At Ascential, our footprint and flexibility allow for scalable, localized execution across the globe.

Todd: Don't follow the bandwagon—use your math. Every company's optimal model is different. Map your risks, evaluate your costs holistically, and align your sourcing strategy with long-term corporate goals. Regionalization isn't just a trend—it's a smart path forward.

Cats with dementia have brain changes similar to those of people with Alzheimer's disease, offering a valuable model for studying the condition in humans, a study says.

Scientists discovered a build-up of the toxic protein amyloid-beta in the brains of cats with the condition – one of the defining features of Alzheimer's disease.

The findings offer a clearer picture of how amyloid-beta may lead to age-related brain dysfunction and memory loss in cats, experts say.

Many older cats develop dementia, leading to behavioural changes such as increased vocalisation – or meowing – confusion and disrupted sleep – symptoms similar to those seen in people with Alzheimer's disease.

Scientists at the University of Edinburgh examined the brains of 25 cats of different ages after they had passed away, including those with signs of dementia.

Powerful microscopy images revealed a build-up of amyloid-beta within the synapses – connections between brain cells – of older cats and cats with dementia.

Synapses allow the flow of messages between brain cells and are vital to healthy brain function. Their loss strongly predicts reduced memory and thinking abilities in humans with Alzheimer's disease.

The research team also found evidence that astrocytes and microglia – types of support cells in the brain – engulfed or 'ate' the affected synapses. This process, called synaptic pruning, is important during brain development but can contribute to synapse loss in dementia.

Experts say the findings will not only help to understand and manage dementia in cats but, given their similarities, could also contribute to the development of future treatments for people with Alzheimer's disease.

Scientists studying Alzheimer's disease in the past have relied heavily on genetically modified rodent models. Rodents do not naturally develop dementia, and studying cats with dementia has the potential to advance knowledge and help develop treatments for both cats and people, experts say.

The study, funded by Wellcome and the UK Dementia Research Institute, is published in the journal European Journal of Neuroscience: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejn.70180 [URL will become active after embargo lifts]. The research team included scientists from the Universities of Edinburgh and California, UK Dementia Research Institute and Scottish Brain Sciences.

Dementia is a devastating disease - whether it affects humans, cats, or dogs. Our findings highlight the striking similarities between feline dementia and Alzheimer's disease in people. This opens the door to exploring whether promising new treatments for human Alzheimer's disease could also help our ageing pets. Because cats naturally develop these brain changes, they may also offer a more accurate model of the disease than traditional laboratory animals, ultimately benefiting both species and their caregivers."

Dr. Robert McGeachan, study lead from the University of Edinburgh's Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies

Professor Danièlle Gunn-Moore, Personal Chair of Feline Medicine at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, said: "Feline dementia is so distressing for the cat and for its person. It is by undertaking studies like this that we will understand how best to treat them. This will be wonderful for the cats, their owners, people with Alzheimer's and their loved ones. Feline dementia is the perfect natural model for Alzheimer's, everyone benefits."

Research from the Nanoscience Center of the University of Jyväskylä, Finland, has revealed that lignin, a polyphenol, important for plant structure, has antimicrobial activity against viruses and bacteria. The results highlight that lignin, which is also an important by-product from wood industry, has potential as promising green alternative to synthetic antimicrobial agents for coating agents, packaging material, or surface disinfectants. The research is fruitful collaboration with Spinnova Oy and CH Bioforce. 

The University of Jyväskylä study used a simple water-based extraction method, in which lignin was isolated in high purity from birch chips, wheat straw and oat husks. The method allows the products to maintain a high total phenol content and effectively remove carbohydrate impurities.

- We revealed that these aqueous-based lignin samples demonstrated strong antiviral efficacy against non-enveloped enteroviruses but also good activity against enveloped coronaviruses and tested bacteria, rejoices Professor of Cell and Molecular Biology Varpu Marjomäki from the University of Jyväskylä.

In addition to testing human seasonal coronavirus (HCoV-OC43) in Biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) laboratory, the research team evaluated the efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in a BSL-3 laboratory in Jyväskylä.

- The results revealed that lignins exhibited much stronger antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19, in comparison to the HCoV-OC43 causing common cold. Furthermore, the lignins had inhibitory effects on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, explains Doctoral Researcher Jun Liu from the University of Jyväskylä.

By employing a range of classical and in-house-developed biochemical and imaging techniques, the research team was able to investigate the underlying antimicrobial mechanisms.

- The results revealed that lignins inactivate enteroviruses by stabilizing and aggregating viral particles, thereby reducing their entry into the host cells and by preventing the release of the infective RNA genome in the cells, says Marjomäki.

In contrast, transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy revealed that lignin solutions disrupted the structural integrity of coronavirus particles, hence reducing their ability to bind to and infect host cells. Electron microscopy also revealed clear effects on bacterial cell membrane and aggregation of bacterial internal materials. Professor of Cell and Molecular Biology Lotta-Riina Sundberg says this suggests that active chemical groups penetrate the cells, ultimately leading to bacterial dysfunction.

- Research shows that lignin can be an environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic microbe-repellent substances. It can be used in coatings, packaging, and disinfectant products in a safer and more sustainable way, specifies Sundberg.

The work was done under tight collaboration between University of Jyväskylä, Spinnova Oy and CH Bioforce.

The world's largest conditional cash transfer programme, the Bolsa Família Programme (BFP), is associated with a substantial reduction in AIDS cases and deaths, especially among brown and black women with lower income and limited education. This was the main conclusion of a study coordinated by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), a centre supported by "la Caixa" Foundation, in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NAIDS/NIH). The results were published in Nature Human Behaviour.

Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs, which provide financial aid to low-income households in exchange for fulfilling health and education requirements, are a key policy tool for addressing the social determinants of health. Implemented in nearly all low- and middle-income countries, CCTs aim to improve the living conditions of families in vulnerable situations.

"We analyzed data from 2007 to 2015, focusing on mothers and daughters in households receiving Bolsa Família, using a causal inference framework and a robust quasi-experimental design," explains Andréa F. Silva, PhD in the Institute of Collective Health, Federal University of Bahia (UFBA) (Salvador, Brazil) and lead author of the study. The analysis covered 12.3 million low-income women, and explored how intersecting vulnerabilities - such as poverty, race, and education - affected the programme's effectiveness.

Among daughters, the programme was associated with a 47% reduction in AIDS incidence and a 55% reduction in AIDS-related mortality. Among mothers, the reductions were 42% and 43%, respectively.

The programme's impact was particularly significant among women facing multiple intersecting vulnerabilities. In particular, brown or black mothers living in extreme poverty and with higher levels of education experienced the greatest improvements: a 56% reduction in AIDS incidence. These findings suggest that education enhances the protective effects of cash transfers on health outcomes.

Brazil has already reported a national decline in AIDS, with the relative incidence dropping by nearly 30% from 2007 to 2021, and over 40% among women. This study suggests that the BFP may be one of the reasons for this success, highlighting the importance of integrated social and health policy approaches.

Beyond financial aid, the BFP includes health and education conditionalities, such as mandatory school attendance, routine health checkups, and participation in health education activities, including sexual and reproductive health, which may further support HIV prevention and treatment. By improving nutrition, reducing food insecurity, and encouraging early engagement with healthcare services, these conditions create a multi-pronged approach to disease prevention.

This is the first large-scale study to assess the intersectional effectiveness of cash transfer programmes on HIV/AIDS outcomes. By linking massive socioeconomic and health datasets, the researchers were able to evaluate the effects of the Bolsa Família Programme across diverse subpopulations, many of whom are often underrepresented in traditional epidemiological studies or clinical trials. This is particularly relevant in policy evaluation: public interventions could have a very different impact according to the characteristics and baseline conditions, and of its beneficiaries.

In the current global context of increasing inequalities and poverty rates, CCT programmes have the potential to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality from AIDS, especially among populations with multiple vulnerabilities. Our findings show that these programmes not only reduce HIV risks and AIDS-related deaths, but also support progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals in Brazil and beyond."

Scientists at Tsinghua University have developed a method to grow kidney tumors in the lab using cells from real patients, offering a potential new tool in the fight against renal cancer. Their research, published in the journal Biofabrication, outlines how 3D bioprinting technology can be used to replicate the unique characteristics of each patient's tumor.

The team combined tumor cells with other cell types, including blood vessel-like structures, to mimic the environment within the body. The lab-grown tumors, called organoids, are created from real patients' tumor cells, and exactly mimic their traits. This realistic model provides a more accurate platform for studying tumor development and testing how different therapies perform. The technology also reduces the need for labour-intensive manual processes, enabling faster and more scalable testing.

The incidence rate of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is increasing annually, posing a serious threat to human health. One of the main challenges in treatment is that many patients don't respond well to chemotherapy, and targeted drugs work differently for each person. tumors vary significantly, and genetic changes over time can lead to treatment failure, drug resistance, and higher chances of recurrence. Current lab models are often inconsistent and don't accurately reflect how tumors behave in the body, making it difficult to test realistic treatment options.

The new 3D bioprinting approach overcomes these limitations by producing organoids that retain the same features as the original tumors. This allows researchers to test multiple therapies quickly and identify the most effective options before applying them in the clinic.

This new method could greatly improve how we study kidney cancer and develop personalized treatments for patients. The rapid production of organoids will make it much faster to find the right treatment for individual patients."

A new study shows the glow from tooth whitening often fades within a year, but whether you still love your smile may depend more on your personality than the shade of your teeth.

Study: Effect of personality characteristics on perception of tooth whitening outcome in young adults in long-term: a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. Image credit: PeopleImages.com - Yuri A/Shutterstock.com

Tooth whitening is a common practice, but its effectiveness over the long term remains unclear. Similarly, its impact on psychological and social health is poorly understood. A study published in Head & Face Medicine examined these aspects of tooth whitening over one year to assess how specific personality traits affected the outcomes.

People often feel dissatisfied with tooth color, which inhibits their willingness to smile. Such attitudes are influenced heavily by culture, demographic profile, age- and sex-related factors, and even education.

Dentists often use standardized shade guides to assess tooth color, but this may not always provide satisfactory results. Spectrophotometry is a more objective and more reproducible instrument-based method of tooth color perception. The CIE Lab color space quantifies color by implementing lightness, red-green, and yellow-blue color axes. This system has been validated and aligns with the human eye's perception.

There is no demonstrated direct relationship between a more cosmetically appealing smile and quality of life. However, personality factors such as neuroticism, conscientiousness, and perfectionism may be more important in determining one's satisfaction with one's smile. In this context, the current study also considered how personality traits might alter the perceived effects of whitening, independent of the actual degree of color change achieved.

The study included 50 participants between 19 and 28 years old, randomized to either an intervention or a control group. The former received a light-activated whitening gel, while the latter received an inactive gel.

The participants were evaluated for tooth color, personality traits, and the intervention's psychosocial impacts at three time points: baseline, one week after treatment, and one year after treatment.

Both intervention and control groups were similar in age distribution, sex ratio, quality of life, spectrum of personality traits, lightness, and translucency. However, the control group had significantly lower chroma (color saturation) at baseline (p=0.001). Notably, high lightness and low chroma predict satisfaction with how one's smile looks.

The group exposed to the whitening gel showed improved tooth color one week after treatment compared to controls. The degree of whitening decreased over time, but even at one year, it was above the baseline.

Chroma decreased in the intervention group over the first week but increased one year after the intervention. The final chroma value remained lower than at baseline. Translucency went down over both the short- and long-term.

The control group showed no difference in either lightness or chroma after one week, but it decreased over one year. Translucency increased over the first week after intervention but declined over the first year thereafter. Thus, the short-term change in color was greater in the intervention group vs the control group. However, the difference between them tapered over the long term.

One week after the intervention, the whitening group significantly reduced psychological and social concerns but did not statistically significantly improve aesthetic concerns or dental self-confidence. This could reflect unrealistic expectations, the initial discomfort, or the need to get used to the change in tooth color. The intervention group did not feel that their teeth looked much better, nor did they feel more self-confident about their teeth. This might be because the difference in tooth color did not match the patient's high expectations. In comparison, controls reported a significant psychological improvement, which persisted over the long term.

At one year, the intervention group was more distressed as they perceived a relapse of their tooth discoloration, especially in participants with a detectable relapse (ΔE ≥ 3). The perceived relapse could have increased psychological stress in this group over time. In contrast, psychological improvement continued in the control group after this time.

“Preserving tooth color and addressing expectations and adaptation issues are crucial for optimizing psychological outcomes of dental aesthetic procedures.”

When stratified by personality traits, the investigators found that people who were more perfectionistic and less neurotic experienced more benefits one week after whitening. Less neurotic individuals were more satisfied with the effects of the whitening gel, in both groups.

Highly perfectionistic people were more likely to feel more socially comfortable after teeth whitening, as they are more conscious of improving their self-perceived formerly undesirable condition. Conversely, more conscientious individuals continued to experience more improvements over the long term. These effects were equally strong in both the whitening and placebo groups, indicating that personality influenced psychosocial outcomes regardless of the actual whitening achieved.

Personality traits affect psychosocial health more than the actual amount of tooth whitening achieved. People who show less responsible attitudes are more likely to act impulsively and may feel less burdened by the appearance of their smiles, thus improvements due to tooth whitening are less likely to benefit them psychosocially.

In this study, participants could not accurately assess the improvements in their tooth color after a tooth-whitening intervention. They often perceived a relapse to the discolored state over time. A strong placebo effect was seen, with participants in the control group showing satisfaction with the color change.

Personality traits played a powerful role in the procedure's impact on patients' psychosocial outcomes. Inter-group differences in psychosocial scores were not statistically significant overall, likely due to the high variability in individual responses. This indicates the need to adopt a personalized approach to cosmetic dental treatments, including individualized counseling, to ensure patient expectations are realistic and that patients are satisfied with the treatment provided.

The authors also noted study limitations, including the small sample size, focus on a single tooth, potential dehydration effects on enamel leading to temporary lightness changes, and technical challenges in repeat color measurements.

Oxytocin promotes social behaviors and helps maintain relationships. But clinical trials in patients with autism show variability in how consistently oxytocin improves these behaviors. Steve Chang, from Yale University, led a study to explore how oxytocin influences brain activity to shape social behavior in rhesus monkeys and why its effects are so variable. This work is featured in JNeurosci's Central Questions for Social Neuroscience Research Special Collection. 

The researchers focused on the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) because these brain areas process reward and integrate information during social decision-making. Delivering oxytocin directly into the BLA had state-dependent effects; when monkeys were socially motivated prior to oxytocin exposure, the hormone maintained socially beneficial decisions and social task behavior over a longer time period, but oxytocin didn't influence the same monkeys when they were less motivated. Brain activity supported these results showing that oxytocin increased BLA and ACC activity only when monkeys were socially motivated. Activity in the BLA and ACC was also more coordinated during prolonged social states, suggesting that oxytocin may stabilize communication in this pathway to sustain social behavior. 

Says Chang, "We previously found that communication between these brain areas is important for social reward and behavior. So, the link between enhancement of this signal and prolonged social behavior was interesting to see." Elaborating on clinical implications, Chang adds, "We have to be more careful and not just use a standardized approach. Even within individuals, there are variations in the effectiveness of oxytocin treatment! It may be important to individually tailor treatments."

An international team, led by scientists from the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute has studied around 3000 people affected by the heart disease dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) – a driver of heart failure and sudden cardiac arrest.

They discovered those who had a mutation in a particular gene called TTN were 21 times more likely to develop the disease than family members who did not carry a mutation.

For the first time, the team found that a person's general health and lifestyle factors; such as being overweight or having high alcohol consumption, contributed to an earlier DCM diagnosis.

The study published in the European Heart Journal involving 1000 families affected by DCM also found men with the mutation were more likely to develop DCM at a younger age than women.

Our study reveals just how much mutations in this gene raise the risk of developing DCM. That's a good thing for patients because it means doctors can keep a far closer eye on them, and ensure they have early access to medical treatments.

We have also crucially shown is that it's not all down to your genes. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and being on the right medications could help prevent or delay dilated cardiomyopathy for decades. We hope it will incentivise those at risk to exercise, eat well and drink less and better manage other risk factors too."

Professor Fatkin, head of the Inherited Heart Diseases Laboratory, Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute

DCM affects approximately one in 250 people worldwide – that's around 32 million individuals.

Truncating mutations in the TTN gene are the most common genetic cause of DCM and can be tested for through a simple blood test but until now it was not known how much these mutations raised the risk of developing the disease, or how other risk factors, both clinical and lifestyle, contributed to the onset of the disease.

Clinical factors such as having high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes also increased the risk, whilst having a history of atrial fibrillation doubled the chance of getting DCM.

The findings highlight the need for more research and clinical trials to determine if people with TTN mutations would benefit from being given DCM medications before symptoms begin.

"There are still so many questions to be solved – for example should we be giving drug therapies to those at risk far earlier? Could that delay or prevent DCM from developing entirely, and if so when exactly should that therapy start?" adds Professor Fatkin.

The researchers recruited 3158 patients from 1043 families affected by TTN mutations. It was the largest study of its kind ever done and involved patients from Australia, North America, the UK, Europe and South Korea. Family members were assessed clinically and underwent genetic testing to see if they carried a TTN mutation.

The researchers first examined the link between the age of diagnosis and the type of mutation and then investigated the relationship between age at DCM diagnosis and cardiac risk factors (such as high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, obesity, diabetes, thyroid disease), and lifestyle factors (including alcohol intake and exercise patterns).

A multi-center study has identified critical risk factors that increase the likelihood of death in children with a heart defect who are awaiting or have recently undergone heart transplantation, according to findings published in Circulation.

Fontan circulatory failure (FCF) is a long-term complication in children born with single-ventricle heart defects who have undergone a series of surgeries that culminates with the Fontan procedure. While this surgery helps reroute blood flow and extend life expectancy, it can lead to chronic health problems, including heart failure and damage to other organs. Many of these patients eventually require a heart transplant.

The new study, conducted across 20 U.S. medical centers, offers new insights into how specific health complications affect survival in children with the condition, said co-author Anna Joong, MD, cardiologist at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

"We have a strong interest in understanding patients with Fontan circulatory failure: how we can better manage their heart failure, when the ideal time is to list them for a heart transplant, and what the risk factors are while waiting for a transplant," Dr. Joong said.

In the study, investigators analyzed data from 409 patients who had undergone a Fontan procedure and were listed for heart transplant between 2008 and 2022. They tracked outcomes from the time of waitlisting through one year after transplant. They found that 5.9 percent died awaiting a transplant, and among those transplanted, 8.5 percent died within the first year.

The investigators also found that certain pre-existing conditions significantly increased the risk of death, including:

Overall, survival has improved for patients who have single ventricle physiology and who had a Fontan. A really novel finding of this study was that patients with low oxygen levels were associated with poor outcomes. That's an important thing for clinicians and families to know about, as an additional risk factor and when to refer to advanced heart failure therapies."

Dr. Anna Joong, MD, cardiologist at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine

The findings should guide clinicians in identifying high-risk patients earlier and considering more aggressive interventions, including earlier heart failure team and transplant referral, Dr. Joong said. Overall, the study lays the groundwork for improving transplant outcomes and tailoring care to the specific needs of children born with single-ventricle heart defects.

Moving forward, Joong and her collaborators will continue to study children post-heart transplant to understand their quality of life and address any functional limitations, she said.

The study was supported by a grant from the Additional Ventures and Enduring Hearts organizations and a gift from the Van Hooser family.

"Pharmacotherapy can help people living with obesity improve overall health, not just lose weight," says Dr. Sue D. Pedersen, MD, endocrinologist and obesity medicine specialist in Calgary, and lead author of this guideline. "The goal of obesity medications is to improve metabolic, mechanical, and/or mental health, and improve quality of life, incorporating treatment goals that are important to each individual patient."

The guideline includes 6 new and 7 revised recommendations, reflecting the latest evidence since the 2022 and 2020 versions of the guideline. It takes the emphasis off body mass index (BMI) and focuses on an individualized approach that uses additional indicators, such as waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, adjusted for sex and ethnicity where appropriate, and the presence of obesity-related complications.

Obesity pharmacotherapy is a safe and effective option to support long-term obesity care. It is one of three pillars of treatment outlined in the full Canadian Adult Obesity Clinical Practice Guideline, with other pillars being behavioural and psychological and surgical approaches. Obesity treatment should always be tailored to each person's specific health needs, values, and preferences. Recommendations also support sustained use of obesity pharmacotherapy as part of a long-term strategy to maintain improvements in health and quality of life."

Dr. Sue D. Pedersen, MD, endocrinologist and obesity medicine specialist in Calgary

Recommendations include two new medications, tirzepatide and setmelanotide, as well as new recommendations for obesity-related complications such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, osteoarthritis, and more.

The guideline recommends against using compounded obesity medications because of concerns about content, safety, efficacy, and quality.

The guideline panel notes that only Alberta recognizes obesity as a chronic disease. Barriers to access - such as cost, stigma, and limited drug plan coverage - continue to prevent Canadians from receiving medication and support.

"The lack of recognition of obesity as a chronic disease by public and private payers, health systems, the public, and media has a trickle-down effect, limiting access to treatment (e.g., related to medication costs)," the authors conclude.

Researchers at City of Hope®, one of the largest and most advanced cancer research and treatment organizations in the United States with its National Medical Center ranked among the nation's top cancer centers by U.S. News & World Report, today published a new study which found that some survivors of childhood cancer are more at risk for serious health issues as they grow older, including new cancers and chronic conditions like heart disease. 

While a cause for concern, the findings published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology also point to a silver lining: The ailments are potentially manageable if caught early and treated.

Our study underscores the importance of partnership among patients, their primary care providers and cancer survivorship programs to ensure survivors receive necessary screening for the early detection, prevention and treatment of conditions, including secondary cancers, resulting from lifesaving treatment. We at City of Hope are continuing to learn more about what health conditions survivors of childhood cancer are at risk for at different times in their life to inform the updating of evidence-based guidelines for cancer survivors."

Rusha Bhandari, M.D., pediatric hematologist-oncologist at City of Hope and corresponding author of the new study

The City of Hope-led study is the first to look at childhood cancer survivors who reached the age of 50, a population that is expected to grow as cancer treatments continue to improve and become more targeted and personalized. 

Nearly 15,000 children and adolescents in the United States are diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma or other types of cancer each year. The rate of young patients surviving cancer for at least five years is now 85%, up from 58% a few decades ago. 

To determine long-term risks, Dr. Bhandari, Saro Armenian, D.O., M.P.H., a pediatric hematologist-oncologist at City of Hope Children's Cancer Center, and their colleagues reviewed a national database that tracks about 40,000 people who were diagnosed with cancer before they turned 21. The researchers identified individuals who were still alive at age 50 and then compared any new incidence of cancer with the rate of cancer found in the general population. The risks for chronic health conditions were compared to the patients' siblings. 

Having overcome cancer at an early age, survivors face new risks when they turn older, the study found. Young patients have a higher risk of secondary cancers and are five times more likely to die from the disease compared to other individuals over the age of 50.

Cancer survivors face increased risks for heart disease as well. In fact, pediatric cancer survivors had a higher incidence of heart problems at age 55 compared to their 70-year-old siblings. They were also more frail, had trouble with physical exertion and suffered poorer health in general. 

Looking at the type of cancer treatment survivors had received, the team found that radiation therapy was the main culprit for future risks, rather than chemotherapy. 

"Radiation causes cellular DNA damage that can lead to mutations and the development of new cancers," said Dr. Armenian, senior author of the study. 

The study was based on treatment regimens used in the 1970s and 80s. There have been vast improvements since then, including delaying or avoiding radiation in favor of targeted cancer drugs and emerging treatments such as immunotherapy and precision oncology. Still, Dr. Bhandari urges greater vigilance to protect against future health problems. 

"Some survivors should screen for conditions like breast or colon cancer at an earlier age than is recommended for the general population," Dr. Armenian said. "Teamwork is needed to ensure survivors receive necessary screening and preventative care for conditions, including secondary cancers."

While young cancer patients faced more health problems as they got older, the study did find a bright spot when it came to mental health. Cancer survivors were no more likely to report mental health issues than their siblings at age 50. 

"This mental health finding may reflect the resilience and positive mindset of our long-term survivors who have battled cancer," Dr. Bhandari said. "This is a wonderful example of how our patients continue to inspire us as they navigate their cancer and survivorship journeys."

Want to volunteer at the FIFA World Cup next year when matches are played in Boston? It's time to apply.

The FIFA World Cup 2026 is calling for more than 65,000 volunteers to help out in the soccer tournament's 16 host cities.

New Englanders can volunteer at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, where the Boston matches will be played, organizers said.

Other Boston-area volunteers might be stationed at local hotels and airports.

To become a volunteer, you'll need to be at least 18 years old at the time of application and able to speak English, FIFA said.

To be eligible, you'll also need to comply with the entry requirements of the host country, whether it be the United States, Canada, or Mexico.

Prospective volunteers will also have to pass a background check and attend volunteer team tryouts.

All volunteers must commit to eight shifts between June 11 and July 19, 2026, organizers said.

You can apply to be a volunteer on the FIFA website.

Volunteers will receive an official World Cup 26 volunteer uniform, meals and refreshments, an exclusive reward and recognition items, and a volunteer certificate for their service, organizers said.

More information can be found on the Boston FIFA World Cup 2026 website.

Seven soccer matches will be hosted at Foxboro's Gillette Stadium over the course of the tournament. Here's the schedule:

Tickets to watch the matches can be purchased starting on Sept. 10.

Moises Caicedo is heading into the 2025/26 season full of belief that Chelsea can make a strong impact in the Premier League. 

He's also excited about stepping onto the Champions League stage for the first time. The Ecuadorian midfielder is coming off a dream campaign.

Voted both Chelsea's Player of the Year and Players' Player of the Year, Caicedo capped his season by helping the Blues lift two trophies.

He scored in the 4-1 demolition of Real Betis in the Europa Conference League final, and his performance at the Club World Cup saw him named the third-best player in the tournament.

Caicedo returned home to Ecuador over the summer and was greeted like a national hero.

“People stopped me in the street,” Caicedo told Chelsea's website. “It was crazy, they were happy to see me, I could see on their faces.

“It was incredible seeing my country and how happy people were watching me win the Club World Cup. My family also are proud of me, and I enjoyed being there a lot.”

Now back at Cobham, Caicedo has shifted his focus to the 2025/26 season. Manager Enzo Maresca has praised him as an important part of the team, and he is using that praise as fuel.

“I appreciate that and it's a motivation for me,” he said. “It's why I train every day even harder.”

Caicedo knows that the coming Premier League season will be as demanding as ever, but he is confident that Chelsea can make their mark.

“I just want to start the season really well,” he said. “For sure, it will be an incredible and tough season also, because we know the Premier League is always tough, but we are going to do well.”

The 23-year-old is also looking forward to playing in the Champions League for the first time in his career after helping the Blues qualify for the first time since 2022/23.

“It's a dream come true and I am looking forward to it,” he said. “It's another level, and now we are there, we want to do really well.”

Chelsea have been busy in the transfer market, but they're still negotiating deals for Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho and RB Leipzig forward Xavi Simons.

Despite playing a key role in Chelsea's Club World Cup win this summer, Robert Sánchez is still deemed the weak link in the Blues' roster. The goalkeeper made many mistakes last season, and Chelsea winning the Club World Cup has given Enzo Maresca the funds to sign a new keeper. 

Chelsea will face competition from Manchester United if they are to sign a world-class player in that position. RMC Sport has reported (translated from French) "Gianluigi Donnarumma is not among the PSG players selected to play in the European Super Cup against Tottenham this Wednesday

"The Italian goalkeeper is being urged to find a new club, following the arrival of Lucas Chevalier from Lille... Chelsea and Manchester United have inquired about the goalkeeper's situation in recent hours." 

Donnarumma played a key role in PSG's Champions League win last season and is regarded as one of the best keepers in the world. However, his contract expires next summer, and the French side has already signed a replacement for him. 

The highly rated 23-year-old, Lucas Chevalier, was signed from LOSC Lille for $47 million this summer. This has made Donnarumma surplus to requirements. However, the Italian international could now get his chance in the Premier League. 

Chelsea is in the Champions League after finishing fourth in the Premier League last season. As Donnarumma won European soccer's top competition last year, he will feel he belongs in the tournament. 

United, on the other hand, finished a lowly 15th in English soccer's top flight last season. They had a chance to qualify for the Champions League via the Europa League. However, they lost in the final of that competition to Tottenham Hotspur. 

Both Chelsea and the Red Devils could do with a new keeper. Sánchez and United's André Onana are not regarded as the best goalies in the world. Onana is also injured, which means that Altay Bayındır will likely start the season as United's first choice. 

United is a historic club, as is Chelsea in the modern era. The lure of Old Trafford is still great, but the Blues are a team that appears to be on the up right now. Therefore, Donnarumma should hold out for a move to Stamford Bridge.

Real Madrid are in action for the first time since they succumbed to a 4–0 drubbing at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain at the Club World Cup.

The summer tournament has distorted Madrid's plans ahead of the 2025–26 season, with only one fixture arranged before their La Liga opener. 

The club were unsuccessful in their efforts to postpone their first game of the league season at home to Osasuna, but will have a couple of extra days to prepare with the fixture scheduled for next Tuesday. Thus, the new season will merely be a week away when they kick-off in Innsbruck. 

Xabi Alonso has named a strong travelling squad for their Austria trip, and here's how you can watch WSG Tirol vs. Real Madrid on TV and live stream.

Supporters around the world can tune into Real Madrid's sole preseason friendly of the summer via Real Madrid TV. 

The club's dedicated channel will be streaming the fixture for free on Tuesday evening. In the United States and Canada, the channel is supported by Tubi. 

For those without access to the TV channel, the friendly can also be streamed via Real Madrid Play, which is accessible on the club's website and mobile app. 

Real Madrid are a week away from the start of the 2025–26 season, with Osasuna, who finished ninth in La Liga last season and have proven to be tricky opposition in recent years, their first opponents. 

Alonso has a fairly tame start to his tenure, with his team taking on the newly-promoted Real Oviedo on Matchweek 2 before clashes against Mallorca, Real Sociedad and Espanyol. The first Madrid Derby and major test of the domestic season is scheduled for Sept. 28.

Amid the uncertainty surrounding Onana's future, Ruben Amorim has been urged to target former Red Devils shot-stopper David De Gea, who returned to Old Trafford with Fiorentina for a pre-season clash last weekend.

Three countries have been banned from competing at the World Cup because of political reasons, following sanctions from the United Nations.

At present, Russia remain suspended from competing in international football and instead have been playing unofficial friendly fixtures against the likes of Belarus, Nigeria, Zambia and Grenada in recent times.

The suspension was announced by FIFA and UEFA in May 2022 amid the invasion of Ukraine and a number of European associations refusing to play Russia.

Russia appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport but were unsuccessful in their efforts - though in March The Independent reported that "moves are currently happening to get Russia back into football".

For the upcoming 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada, eight countries were banned from competing in qualifying for a multitude of reasons.

A good chunk of World Cup bans have been for football reasons, including Mexico in 1990 for fielding overage players at the World Youth Championships and Japan for missed payments back in 1950.

But only three have been blocked from World Cup participation because of a political element.

Having been hosts for the 2018 edition, Russia were banned from both the 2022 and 2026 World Cup tournaments because of the Ukraine invasion and the fact that England, Poland, and Sweden had said they would not play them.

The ban extends to the youth and women's teams and also applies to the European Championships, with Russian sides also not permitted to play in UEFA competitions.

In 2022, Russia had progressed to play-offs for World Cup qualifying but their tie with Poland was cancelled and their opponents received a bye to the next round.

Back in 1992, with United Nations sanctions against the country, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was banned from international football following on from the dissolving of Yugoslavia.

They had finished top of their qualifying group for Euro 92 but received the suspension just 10 days before and were replaced by Denmark, who went on to win the competition. The ban extended to qualifying for the 1994 World Cup and when it was lifted, the union of Serbia and Montenegro continued under the name before being renamed in 2003 and qualifying for the 2006 World Cup with that title.

Both would go on to gain full independence and split to compete as separate nations.

The second World Cup host, South Africa put on a memorable festival of football in 2010 but they were banned by FIFA in 1961 during the period of racial apartheid.

The ban was lifted in 1963 following a visit from hen-FIFA President Stanley Rous and there was talk of South African FA proposing playing an all-white team for the 1966 World Cup and team made up of back players four years later.

The idea was rejected and the South African FA was suspended by FIFA in 1965 and later expelled two years later when Joao Havelange became FIFA president.

Their reinstating came in 1992 and they went on to win the Africa Cup of Nations in 1996.

Luis Enrique has not been given a touchline ban for the UEFA Super Cup, despite his apparent 'slap' on Joao Pedro at the Club World Cup. 

FIFA launched an investigation into the shocking incident at the end of the bad-tempered final between PSG and Chelsea last month. 

And despite Enrique appearing to connect with the Brazilian's face, before the striker went down to the turf, he has escaped punishment. 

That means he'll be in situ in his technical area as usual when the Champions League winners face Europa League champions Spurs on Wednesday night in Italy. 

Enrique's 'slap' was another major flashpoint of the game in which Joao Neves was sent off for pulling the hair of Marc Cucurella.

After the final whistle, players and coaches from both sides came together in an altercation, with Enrique also involved.

During the melee, Enrique appeared to use his hand to make contact with Pedro in what some have termed a slap. 

Pedro hit the turf in a heap, with PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma in close proximity. 

Enrique subsequently tried to explain his actions, claiming he was attempting to act as a peacekeeper.    

'At the end of the match, there is a lot of tension. It is a situation that can be avoided by everyone,' said the PSG boss.

'I think that is logical. I am going to prevent my players from going any further in that brawl and from then on there is pushing and shoving from everyone. 

'I think that is not the best thing to do. 

'It's a result of the tension, the result of the situation of the match and I have nothing more to add. 

When asked about the incident with Enrique after full-time, Pedro said: 'We're world champions and that's what matters.

'At the end of the day, it's normal. Both teams wanted to win and that happens. It's all part of it.'

Barcelona's dressing room has reportedly been rocked by an extraordinary bust-up between two of its brightest young stars, with Gavi allegedly demanding that his long-time friend Fermin Lopez be sold after a furious clash that nearly turned physical. The pair's relationship stretches back to their teenage years at La Masia but those warm memories have been torched in recent days, as a personal dispute has spiralled into a full-blown feud.

Coral and Ladbrokes owner Entain has revealed a surge in online gaming as popular sporting events such as Wimbledon and the men's football Club World Cup reeled in punters.

The sports betting giant reported total net gaming revenues – the amount of money the company pockets after paying out winnings to customers – of £2.6 billion for the first six months of the year, excluding its operations in the US.

This was 6% higher than the same period a year ago, at constant currency rates.

The increase jumped to 8% in the UK and Ireland, the company's biggest market, while online sales in the region surged by a fifth year-on-year.

Both the volume of players and the value of sales increased, which Entain said reflected an improved experience for customers as well as previous changes to gambling rules starting to level out.

The company had previously warned about the impact from regulatory changes in the UK which were designed to make betting safer for consumers.

The FIFA Club World Cup final, which saw Chelsea beat PSG, was the most bet-on football match of 2025 for Entain's brands, with strong engagement coming from Brazil, Spain and the US.

Interest in horse racing surged with the Royal Ascot and the Epsom Derby Festival both among the most bet-on competitions, while Wimbledon Tennis and the Women's Euro football tournament were also drawing in bets.

Entain nonetheless reported a pre-tax loss of £96 million for the first half, swinging from a £13.7 million profit the prior year which the firm said was driven by one-off costs.

On an underlying basis, earnings before tax, interest and other costs came in at £583.4 million for the period – 11% higher than last year.

The company said it was now expecting higher sales growth for the year than its previous outlook, with online net gaming revenues forecast to rise by 7%.

Annual underlying earnings are estimated to be between £1.1 billion and £1.15 billion.

Alejandro Garnacho has reportedly issued a bombshell ultimatum to Manchester United in order to push through his proposed transfer to Chelsea. The 21-year-old winger has made it clear that his future lies away from Manchester, with Stamford Bridge emerging as his preferred next destination.

Many in north London would've liked to see more of the 19-year-old this term, but her time is better spent elsewhere in the Women's Super League

No one announced themselves at the 2025 European Championship quite like Michelle Agyemang. The 19-year-old was a relative unknown in her own country, never mind on the continent, before the tournament got underway. Her efforts in Switzerland, though, would help propel England to a successful title defence, while securing individual glory for herself in the form of the Best Young Player award and a spot on the list of nominees for the Kopa Trophy, announced last week.

Yet, as the focus starts to turn towards the new club season, many who watched Agyemang rifle in vital goals against Sweden and Italy in the Euro 2025 quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively, will have been surprised to see the Mirror report that Arsenal are in discussions with Brighton about sending the teenager back on loan to the south coast, where she spent the last campaign, rather than factoring her into their own first-team plans for the coming year. This is just a few weeks after Agyemang showed incredible composure in front of goal and all-round quality to be a regular game-changer for one of the best national teams in the women's game.

But while this summer was certainly an indication that the striker would be capable of making an impact at Arsenal this season, the right move for Agyemang, the Gunners and even England right now is another temporary switch.

ATLANTA (AP) — Human rights scandals have marred World Cup tournaments for years, but FIFA is testing a new protocol requiring all host committees to develop action plans to protect human rights for the 2026 games in North America.

With the games less than a year away, though, FIFA's commitment to upholding human rights is still under scrutiny. Human rights advocates who wanted more enforceable standards and clearer directions for local officials say FIFA watered down a more robust model for the plans. 

“Even though where we landed is very different than what we had consulted them on, the existence of the framework is in many ways unprecedented. Sports bodies have not had human rights frameworks that reflected the breadth of issues covered across so many jurisdictions. But the plan is just a plan. It's not self-executing,” said Jennifer Li, director of the O'Neill Institute's Center for Community Health Innovation at Georgetown Law and national coordinator of the Dignity 2026 Coalition, which is working with FIFA on human rights.

Adding to advocates' unease, several U.S. host committees said they couldn't meet a March deadline for an early draft of their plans. A FIFA spokesperson said the governing body has been working closely with host cities and counties, which they say are on track to develop final action plans by the Aug. 29 deadline. Sixteen North American sites will host games, including 11 in the U.S.

Human rights concerns in North America look different from those in other countries where FIFA has come under fire, which had few protections for workers and massive stadium and transportation construction projects. Migrant workers labored in Qatar's scorching heat for more than a decade before the 2022 World Cup there, and human rights advocates worry migrant workers' lives are again at risk in Saudi Arabia, which will host the games in 2034.

FIFA's suggestions for the 2026 plans include guidelines on nondiscrimination, security, preventing trafficking, protecting unhoused people and workers' rights, including for migrant workers.

“The host communities are quite invested in their legacy, so they've stepped up,” said labor rights expert Deborah Greenfield, who is in an expert advisory group supporting FIFA's human rights work for 2026.

U.S. President Donald Trump has ramped up immigration enforcement across the country, stirring fears that federal law enforcement officers will arrest workers and even travelers during the games. Trump imposed a travel ban on 12 countries in June, and seven face restrictions. 

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has close ties to Trump. A FIFA spokesperson said it is working with a White House task force to “bring millions of people from different nations and communities” together in the U.S.

Protesters in Miami-Dade County gathered outside FIFA's offices in June to demand that the governing body protect travelers and workers and speak out against Trump's immigration moves. That came after a Club World Cup event hosted in the area by Spanish-language TV network Telemundo was canceled after an unexpected Coast Guard inspection involving at least one Border Patrol agent, local outlets reported.

“There's no guarantee that you might not have ICE posted up at the World Cup,” South Florida AFL-CIO President Jeff Mitchell said.

Local organizers don't seem to have their human rights plan ready and haven't agreed to meet with the union, Mitchell said. He noted that the region has a history of wage theft in a state with weak heat protection laws for workers.

“Organizations like FIFA like to say that they have these human rights efforts, but they aren't pushing it,” Mitchell said. “They're leaving it up to the locals to do it. What tends to happen is everybody gets their bag and then they turn a blind eye to making sure people are getting paid properly or not being harassed.”

Miami-Dade officials referred The Associated Press to the local host committee, which did not respond to requests for comment. 

More than 9,000 unhoused people were arrested when Atlanta prepared to host the Olympics in 1996, and a plan to eliminate homelessness downtown before the World Cup worries advocates that unhoused people will be jailed again. 

Atlanta officials and partners say the Downtown Rising plan is a part of the mayor's larger investments in reducing homelessness and building affordable housing. The goal is to house people, not put them in jail, officials say.

In California, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom called on cities to ban encampments in May and offered money for mental health and substance use treatment. Cities with impending sporting events have ramped up enforcement, including San Jose, where unhoused people who reject three offers of shelter will now be eligible for arrest on trespassing charges. The mayor said the policy would encourage people to move inside. 

“This panic rush to disappear visible signs of poverty is very concerning,” said Dr. Mark Spencer, an Atlanta hospital physician involved in local advocacy. “Politicians and the business community know that visible signs of poverty are unpopular, and that's the driving force behind what is happening. It's not about human rights in any meaningful way.”

FIFA's human rights policy published in 2017 mandates bidders for the men's 2026 World Cup to respect “international human rights and labor standards according to the United Nations' guiding principles.” 

A group of international lawyers filed a formal complaint to FIFA in May claiming the soccer body is failing to uphold its human rights policy with 2034 World Cup host Saudi Arabia.

In North America, Greenfield said FIFA is taking the goal of having a tournament “that respects and promotes human rights” seriously and she wouldn't be participating in the effort if she didn't think that was possible.

Candace Stanciel, Atlanta's chief equity officer, said the city was committed to human rights work before FIFA came in and launched efforts to combat human trafficking in airports, hotels and public transport. Officials are working on potential language tools, accessibility measures for people with disabilities and an app to report issues including human rights abuses.

One of Seattle's largest labor organizations and the city's organizing committee signed a labor standards agreement last year. The International Labour Organization called FIFA's human rights framework “an important step forward in harnessing the power of sport to advance decent work globally,” adding that it aligns with international labor standards.

How do we fill the days until the 2026 World Cup? By keeping up with some of the world's top sides in what will be an action-packed European club season. 

Three of the continent's Big Five circuits – England's Premier League, Spain's La Liga and Ligue 1 in France – kick off this weekend, with Germany's Bundesliga and Italy's Serie A following on Aug. 22 and 23, respectively. In other countries, domestic league action is already underway. 

But these are the 20 clubs to watch, loaded with the stars we'll be seeing next summer. Ahead of the top European campaigns kicking off, let's count down the teams who'll shine the brightest.

Note: League positions reflect last season's finish.

So what if the defending European champions lost decisively to Chelsea in last month's FIFA Club World Cup final? Luis Enrique's PSG is still the team to beat in 2025-26. Luis Enrique returns close to his entire squad from last season's long-awaited triumph, though keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma could leave this month. If he does, the Parisians already have Donnarumma's replacement in French international Lucas Chevalier, who arrived from Lille for $47 million.   

Last year, the Reds ran away with the Premier League title, besting second-place Arsenal by 10 points. Despite the tragic death of forward Diogo Jota, Liverpool has only gotten better this summer. Arne Slot's side has been the big winner of this transfer window, dropping north of $350 million on backup keeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, defenders Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, and forwards Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz. No wonder they're the favorites to retain the English title.

Baca was just seconds away from reaching the UEFA Champions League final last season under first-year manager Hansi Flick. This season, the Blaugrana are looking to go at least one step further. Who says they can't? Eighteen-year-old Lamine Yamal is on his way to becoming the world's best player — if he isn't already. Fellow Ballon d'Or candidate Raphinha had 34 goals in all competitions in 2024-25, doubling his previous career-best. Robert Lewandowski, who turns 37 on Aug. 21, remains an elite striker. Pedri runs the show behind them. The rest of the regulars return, too, with forward Marcus Rashford the marquee summer addition. 

After finishing fourth in the Prem last term, the Blues stunned many by winning the expanded, 32-team Club World Cup in July. Can they harness that momentum and use it to challenge for English and European titles next spring? They've got the firepower. Chelsea already have an emerging superstar in winger Cole Palmer — this season he'll be supported by new recruits like strikers Liam Delap and João Pedro, Pedro's fellow Brazilian attacker Estêvão, and English forward Jamie Gittens.

The Premier League runner-up in each of the last three seasons, what Mikel Arteta's team is missing at this point are trophies. Still, Arsenal continues to improve. The Gunners knocked then-Champions League holders Real Madrid out of Europe's top club tournament last April, snaring a convincing 5-1 aggregate win. And they've added real quality this summer in the form of defensive midfielder Martín Zubimendi and forwards Viktor Gyökeres and Noni Madueke. 

The record 15-time European champs are coming off what, by their standards, was a dreadful 2024-25, with no major titles secured. But Los Blancos still boast one of the deepest, most expensive squads on Planet Fútbol. And Kylian Mbappé & Co. are now led by one of the sport's great up-and-coming coaches in former Real Madrid captain Xabi Alonso, who replaced the legendary Carlo Ancelotti in June. 

City's unprecedented run of four consecutive Premier League titles came to a halt last season, when Pep Guardiola's side finished third, lost the FA Cup final to Crystal Palace, and were eliminated from European play before the Champions League's round of 16 even began. This team is too good not to bounce back in a big way this year, though — even without club legend Kevin de Bruyne, whose contract wasn't extended. 

Having reached the UEFA Champions League final in two of the last three seasons, nobody should underestimate the Nerazzurri. Inter added Croatian midfielder Petar Sučić, Brazilian winger Luis Henrique and French striker Ange-Yoan Bonny this summer. Besides veteran forward Joaquín Correa, their most significant departure is manager Simone Inzaghi, who was replaced by former Inter defender Cristian Chivu in June. 

After losing the German title to Bayer Leverkusen in 2023-24, Bayern reclaimed its status as the Bundesliga's standard-bearer last season, finishing as champs for the 12th time in 13 seasons.  Things will be different this year without club legend (and new Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder) Thomas Müller, with Leroy Sané leaving, too. But the $81 million arrival of Colombian winger Luis Díaz from Liverpool will help.

Can Atleti end their four-year title drought and beat Barcelona and Real Madrid to La Liga glory this season? Occasionally, Madrid's other team outlasts Spain's double-headed monster. Longtime manager Diego Simeone will be hoping his team is due after a strong summer transfer window which saw $185 million-worth of new talent arrive — including former Villarreal attacker Álex Baena, USMNT midfielder Johnny Cardoso and Argentine World Cup-winner (and Atlanta United alum) Thiago Almada. 

Scudetto winners in 2023 and 2025, the Neapolitans are no doubt aiming for similar success in European play this season to celebrate the club's centennial. The arrival of Champions League winner Kevin de Bruyne on a free transfer from Manchester City can't hurt. Neither will forward Noa Lang, who helped PSV reach the knockout stage in each of the last two years. 

The Magpies eked into the Champions League places last term only because UEFA granted England's top flight one additional spot. Newcastle fans aren't complaining though, though they will be if and when star forward Alexander Isak leaves for Liverpool on the eve of the new season. 

Juve got the proven, consistent goalscorer they've long needed when the "Old Lady" inked Canadian striker Jonathan David on a free transfer from Lille following the Concacaf Gold Cup. David replaces Randal Kolo Muani, who returned to PSG upon the completion of his loan, in manager Igor Tudor's lineup.

The club that helped develop the all-world likes of Jude Bellingham and Erling Haaland in recent years has a new batch coming through — one led by midfielder Jobe Bellingham, Jude's younger brother. But most of the vets that took the Black & Yellow to the 2024 Champions League final remain, not least captain Emre Can, playmaker Julian Brandt and Swiss keeper Gregor Kobel. 

It's hard to believe that the 20-time English champions finished 15th last season, when they also lost the Europa League final to Premier League rivals Tottenham. But the Red Devils added forwards Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Šeško this window, and they should fare better in Ruben Amorim's first full season at the Old Trafford helm. 

Plenty of big names — think Mbappé, Thierry Henry and George Weah — have come through the Principality over the years. AS Monaco added a few more this summer in former France World Cup winner Paul Pogba and Barcelona loanee Ansu Fati. Both should help in the Champions League, with Les Rouge et Blancs looking to reach the round of 16 for the first time since 2017. 

The loss of star attractions Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong (both to Liverpool) and manager Xabi Alonso (to Real Madrid) hurts. Same for Odilon Kossounou and Granit Xhaka, who also left this summer. But stout defender Jarell Quansah, fellow $40 million man (and USMNT star) Malik Tillman, and new boss Eric ten Hag should help keep the club near the top of the Bundesliga. 

As Dutch champs the last two years, PSV has also pushed above its weight in the Champions League, reaching the knockout stages twice and knocking out Italian titans Juventus last season. They lost Tillman, Lang and others this summer, but having USMNT pair Sergiño Dest and Ricardo Pepi back healthy this season could be a coup for coach Peter Bosz.

The Champions League-bound Turkish giants made waves this summer by signing prolific 26-year-old Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen from Napoli for $87 million on a permanent deal, as well as bringing in German winger Leroy Sané for free from Bayern Munich. 

The Ligue 1 runner-up to PSG last year and three times overall this decade, Marseille is chasing its first domestic title since 2010. The ambition is there, with L'OM dropping almost $90 million on transfers this summer. Yet two potentially huge contributors came for free: former Arsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and USMNT veteran Tim Weah, who previously won a French title with Lille in 2020-21.

Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek surprised some of their most loyal fans at the Cincinnati Open, answering their questions live and then unknowingly joining them for a conversation and hug.

The Cincinnati Open is famously known for its unparalleled access to players, but this is taking it to a whole different level.

This week at the WTA 1000 event in Mason, Ohio, a select number of lucky fans were given the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to record messages for their favorite players on the Fan Cam.

Little did they know, the players -- World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, No. 3 Iga Swiatek and the top two men's players in the world, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz -- were standing 5 yards away from them, listening closely to every word they were saying.

The tennis stars got a kick out of the fan comments, with Sabalenka showing a heart sign upon hearing the fans praise her authenticity and Swiatek playfully growling after hearing that she's an "animal."

Given an opportunity to ask questions -- which they presumably would never hear the answers to, or so they thought -- the fans were floored when the players immediately answered them in real time.

"It's pretty cool, to be honest," Sabalenka casually answered a young girl, who asked her what it's like to be the No. 1 player in the world. 

"Oh my gosh, you're live?" a diehard Swiatek fan said, bewildered and looking like she was about to come out of her shoes. 

And as if that wasn't epic enough, there was a second surprise, and this one was even more special.

Swiatek and the others informed the fans that they had a little gift for them, at the back of the room. When they headed there, they were blown away to find their favorite players in the flesh, quietly standing behind them and photobombing. The fans got some hugs and a bit of conversation -- Sabalenka called one of her young fans a "future superstar" -- the perfect bow on the ultimate tennis bucket-list moment, one they'll surely never forget.

Sabalenka, the defending champion in Cincinnati, is into the fourth round after a thrilling three-hour, three-set win over 30th seed Emma Raducanu. She'll play Jessica Bouzas Maneiro for a spot in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. Swiatek is also in the fourth round after 25th seed Marta Kostyuk withdrew with a right wrist injury. She'll play Sorana Cirstea on Wednesday.

Goran Ivanisevic had big hopes for Elena Rybakina when he coached her earlier this year.

Ivanisevic only coached Rybakina for two tournaments, before leaving her team after the Australian Open.

Since then, Rybakina has been coached by Davide Sanguinetti, while also being in regular contact with Stefano Vukov before he was able to return to the WTA Tour from his suspension. 

Despite the coaching relationship not being particularly successful, Ivanisevic did have big hopes for Rybakina.

Rybakina won her only Grand Slam title at Wimbledon in 2022, and has been ranked as high as world number three.

However, the Kazakhstani player's recent Grand Slam results have not lived up to her potential, with Rybakina continually suffering from the same issue.

Seven months after their coaching partnership came to an end, it has now been revealed how much potential Ivanisevic actually thinks Rybakina has.

Former top five ranked players Dinara Safina and Anna Chakvetadze recently interviewed Ivanisevic for their podcast, and the former has now revealed that the Croatian told them something off podcast.

According to Chakvetadze, Ivanisevic believes that Rybakina should be winning at least three or four Wimbledon titles.

The former world number five said, “When we interviewed Goran Ivanisevic, he said off-camera ‘I don't understand, she has such an amazing game, she should be winning more tournaments on grass, not one Wimbledon but 3-4 at least.”

Anna Chakvetadze about Elena Rybakina on podcast with Dinara Safina:"When we interviewed Goran Ivanisevic, he said off-camera 'I don't understand, she has such an amazing game, she should be winning more tournaments on grass, not one Wimbledon but 3-4 at least." pic.twitter.com/S8L20pq6rM

Rybakina actually won the Wimbledon title on just her second main draw appearance at the grass court major.

While she has reached the latter stages of Wimbledon since, Rybakina has been unable to add to her Grand Slam trophy cabinet since then.

The 2025 Championships were the worst of her career, with Rybakina losing to Clara Tauson in the third round of Wimbledon.

Rybakina's game appears to be suited to grass, but she has not won a title on the surface outside of Wimbledon in 2022.

The best results Rybakina has achieved at a grass court WTA Tour-level event came when she reached the semifinals of both the Libema Open (2019) and the Eastbourne International (2021).

The Cincinnati Open is well underway, with the world's best players still looking for a spot in the last 16. World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has already booked his place in round four, and former finalist Carlos Alcaraz will be hoping to join him when he takes on Hamad Medjedovic.

World No. 1 and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka survived a huge scare in her own third-round match, as Emma Raducanu pushed her to the brink before losing 7-6 4-6 7-6. It was an impressive performance from Raducanu, who was told off by the umpire for communicating a little too much with her new coach, Francisco Roig, during the first set.

But the conditions have been brutal so far in Cincinnati. Cameron Norrie and Daniil Medvedev struggled with the heat over the weekend and things took a turn on Monday when Arthur Rinderknech collapsed in the middle of his match against Felix Auger-Aliassime, and retired a few games later. Play was then interrupted by a power cut, and later by a fire alarm. Express Sport will bring you the very best news, gossip and reaction from the Cincinnati Open.

Grigor Dimitrov has officially pulled out of the US Open.

The Bulgarian suffered an injury at Wimbledon and has been missing in action ever since.

The tournament organisers have confirmed today he won't take part in the competition.

Alejandro Tabilo will take the Bulgarian star's spot instead.

It brings an end to a remarkable run of 58 Grand Slam main draw appearances.



Francisco Comesana appears to be struggling with the conditions.

He's taken himself to the side of the court and currently has his head in his hands.

The umpire appeared to suggest he could be about to vomit.

A medical time-out has been called.

Alexei Popyrin digs deep to take the opening set against Andrey Rublev.

That one went the full distance!



Alexei Popyrin and Andrey Rublev are locked at 6-6 in the first set.

They're heading for a tiebreaker.

Taylor Fritz believes he and Elena Rybakina are the team to beat at the revamped US Open mixed doubles event next week.

The pair won the Indian Wells exhibition earlier this year and have more experience together than blockbuster pairings like Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz.

The ATP No. 4 told Tennis Channel: "I really do think we're one of the favourites. We have a mixed doubles title already, and I thought we played great there. I'd love to play mixed doubles regularly if it didn't overlap with singles, but being able to play it before the week starts is amazing. I'm super excited."



Grigor Dimitrov has pulled out of the US Open, according to the DartsRankings entry list.

The world No. 21 was forced to retire when he hurt his pectoral muscle mid-match at Wimbledon. Dimitrov was on course to pull off a huge upset when he led world No. 1 Jannik Sinner 6-3 7-5 2-2 in the fourth round.

But he suddenly went down in pain and was left in tears as he forfeited the match. It was Dimitrov's fifth successive mid-match retirement at a Grand Slam tournament.

The former world No. 3 later shared a photo on Instagram, showing himself in a hospital bed, and wrote: “Thank you for the overwhelming wave of love - from family, friends, fans, colleagues, to the entire tennis community… your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times. Thank you all. Truly. Recovery starts now. I'll see you all soon.”

He has not played a match since, and will now miss the US Open.

Frances Tiafoe will represent Team World at the Laver Cup for the sixth time in his career.

The world No. 14 joins Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, Tommy Paul, and Joao Fonseca on World's squad, which is now led by a new captain in Andre Agassi.

Tiafoe said: “There's nothing like Laver Cup. I love playing for Team World and competing alongside guys who are usually my rivals.

“We've built something special, and I can't wait to bring that same energy to San Francisco. Playing at home in front of U.S. fans means a lot – and I want to do everything I can to help us win.”



Emma Raducanu has added another event to her packed tennis schedule.

Less than 24 hours after she suffered a tight defeat to world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in Cincinnati, it was confirmed that Raducanu will make her Toray Pan Pacific Open debut this year.

The WTA 500 event in Tokyo is part of the Asian swing and runs from October 20 to 26.

World No. 4 Jessica Pegula has revealed that her former coaches and even her parents weren't happy with her attitude on the court growing up.

The American is known for her calm demeanour and rarely gets super fired up during matches. While she's commended for her cool and collected approach now, Pegula was previously told she had a "bad attitude".

Appearing on the Tennis Insider Club podcast, she said: "When I was growing up, everyone always - and I say everyone is in, my parents or my coaches at the time - like never really liked my attitude. I always kind of had a bad attitude.

"And so not a bad attitude, but they'd say, you know, you look like you don't care. Passive kind of thing. And I'd be like, so then I kind of got this complex, like they were trying to get me to be fired up and I'd be like, that's okay, but like, I can't do that, so do I do it?

"So then I get mad. I think then I just started kind of being more emotional and maybe a little bit more like bad attitude."



Jessica Pegula has struggled since lifting the title in Bad Homburg in June.

The world No. 4 suffered a shock first-round exit at Wimbledon, and then lost her opening match in Washington. As the two-time defending champion at the recent Canadian Open, she was stunned by Anastasija Sevastova, losing her first match at the tournament since 2022.

But Pegula is keen to bounce back in Cincinnati this week.

She said: I'm playing good tennis, but sometimes taking control of the momentum and those big points is something that I just haven't been able to execute coming off of Wimbledon.

"It's frustrating, but at the same time, you just keep working and trying to problem solve and figure out. What is that cue to get that back, or what is that cue to get your feet moving, your serve or return? We've just been trying to problem solve it, but at the same time, not overthink it. That's hard.

"You're trying to go out there and work on things, trying to get back to basics, and that can be a little up and down. I feel like I'm in the thick of it, but it's not the first time."

Jack Draper is preparing to make his return at the US Open after an arm injury forced him to skip the Masters 1000 events in Canada and Cincinnati.

The British No. 1 - who has not played a match since Wimbledon - had also signed up for the new US Open mixed doubles event. After his first partner, Qinwen Zheng, was forced to withdraw after having surgery, he re-entered with Paula Badosa.

But Badosa has also pulled out, and it's not known whether Draper will attempt to play with a third teammate.

For now, he's excited to get back on the court in New York.

Draper told the LTA: “I got back to my tennis slowly to protect my arm, but it's been a really productive few weeks now. It was disappointing to miss Toronto and Cincinnati, but I think it's been a good period for me to reflect on things and improve.

“I'm really looking forward to going out to the US Open, and I'm in a great place personally and tennis-wise. I feel refreshed, motivated, and I can't wait to get back out there.”

Felix Auger-Aliassime has spoken out on the brutal conditions in Cincinnati after his opponent, Arthur Rinderknech, collapsed during their match on Monday and soon retired.

“It feels like we're in an oven, even for the fans. We're always on the move and focused on trying to win, but the crowd is sitting for a long time, and so are our coaches,” the No. 23 seed told Tennis Channel.

“A friendly reminder to everyone: drink plenty of water, bring hats, and cool off as much as possible.”



Two junior stars have already earned main draw wildcards for the upcoming US Open after claiming titles at the USTA Boys' and Girls' 18s National Championships over the weekend.

Darwin Blanch - the 17-year-old who was thrashed by Rafael Nadal at last year's Madrid Open - won the boys' title.

Meanwhile, 18-year-old Ahn, who is set to play college tennis at Stanford, won the girls' title.

Runners-up Jack Satterfield and Maya Iyengar are set to receive qualifying wildcards.

Venus Williams recently returned from a 16-month hiatus, reaching the second round in both singles and doubles in Washington. After losing her opening match in Cincinnati, she will turn her attention to the US Open, where she has entered the revamped mixed doubles event with Reilly Opelka.

But Rick Macci, an important figure in the Williams sisters' early development as tennis players who went on to coach both Venus and Serena, has suggested that Serena could also make a return in Flushing Meadows and play women's doubles with her sister.

“Asked if Serena will play doubles with Vee at the OPEN. My gut is probably because at the end of the day Serena can still play even though she has been away,” Macci tweeted.

“Her serve is still one of the best on the planet and when she competes her mindset is like granite.”



Emma Raducanu wasn't the only player with a new coach at this year's Cincinnati Open. Aryna Sabalenka recently added former doubles No. 1 Max Mirnyi to her team, and she wants him to help with her skills at the net.

The top seed beat Raducanu 7-6 4-6 7-6 in the third round on Monday and admitted that their work had already paid off.

“I was brave enough to come to the net and take risks with some shots I've been working on for the last couple of weeks,” the reigning Cincinnati champion explained.

“Max is very happy with my volley, but at the same time, he thinks it's too risky. I'm very happy with that shot. I was brave in some decisions, and I think that's why I got the win.”

The Cincinnati Open marked Emma Raducanu's first tournament with new coach Francisco Roig in her corner.

Roig spent years working with Rafael Nadal, and he had a successful post-Wimbledon trial week with Raducanu before they officially joined forces in Cincinnati.

After pushing world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in a 7-6 4-6 7-6 defeat with a vocal Roig cheering her on, Raducanu expressed some early optimism about their new partnership.

She said: I think the first week went well. I think we practised well.

"I made some improvements and I think for certain moments, you could see some stuff we practised peek through. But given that it's only been a week, I think there's been improvements."



Former world No. 3 Stan Wawrinka, who lifted the trophy at the 2016 US Open, will hope to receive a wildcard into the upcoming tournament. For now, he's busy getting some reps in on the Challenger Tour.

Now aged 40, Wawrinka was one of the biggest threats to the Big Four's dominance during the 2010s and claimed three Grand Slam titles.

But his ranking has dropped to No. 152 in the world, and he regularly competes on the Challenger circuit to get more matches and ranking points under his belt.

The 2016 US Open champion is in action at this week's Europcar Cancun Country Club in Cancun, where he faces a qualifier in his opening match.

It's been a positive tournament for the Frenchmen in Cincinnati this year. The draw size at the Masters 1000 event has been expanded to include 96 players, and some of the lower-ranked competitors are making the most of it.

Three unseeded French players are through to the round of 16 in the men's draw.

Qualifier Adrian Mannarino stunned No. 13 seed Tommy Paul on Monday, coming back to win 5-7 6-3 6-4.

Benjamin Bonzi also mounted a comeback to beat Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(4) 6-3 6-4.

And Terence Atmane, another qualifier, took out teenage sensation Joao Fonseca 6-3 6-4.



World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka has joked that Emma Raducanu made her feel like she was "getting old" during their three-hour, three-set match on Monday.

Aged 27, Sabalenka is only five years older than Raducanu, but she felt the heat during her 7-6 4-6 7-6 victory and said: "The whole time I've been thinking, this is what they call aging. I was like, ‘This is how it feels to be old.'

"I looked at Emma and she was pumped and ready to play the next point, and I was still trying to recover my breath. I looked at Jason [Stacy, her fitness coach], didn't say anything, but we need to do something because I'm getting old."



The US Open's revamped mixed doubles event gets underway next week. Only 16 teams will get to compete over two days, with eight entries being determined by their best combined singles ranking, and the other eight teams getting wildcards.

But there has been plenty of backlash to the overhaul, especially from doubles specialists, who can no longer enter the tournament using their doubles ranking.

Jessica Pegula, who has signed up to play alongside Tommy Paul, has now claimed US Open bosses went "rogue" and made the changes without consulting players.

Speaking in Cincinnati, the American said: "We were like, Okay, you guys just went rogue and changed the format and didn't tell anybody. You just kind of did it. What do you even know? Did you talk to the players? Did you get their input about how it could be better?

"I think that's just something that we as players are trying to work with them on, having that line of communication be a lot smoother."

There was chaos at the Cincinnati Open on Monday when play was suspended for 75 minutes due to a local power outage.

Broadcast cameras suddenly cut off around 5pm local time but the matches on court initially continued as normal. But play was halted when it emerged that the tournament had been affected by a power cut.

The matches resumed shortly after 6.30pm local time, and Taylor Fritz beat Lorenzo Sonego while Benjamin Bonzi came back to beat Stefanos Tsitsipas.

There was another interruption during the night session when a fire alarm went off during Jannik Sinner's showdown with Gabriel Diallo. But after a short delay, they decided to play on.

Emma Raducanu was understandably disappointed to come out on the losing end of a three-hour and nine-minute battle with world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka on Monday. But the Brit is still proud of herself for pushing the world's best player, especially on a surface she feels less confident on.

"She's world No. 1 for a reason and I pushed her more than I did at Wimbledon so that's an improvement," Raducanu said, referencing her two-set loss to Sabalenka at SW19 last month.

"And also, it was good to have this result on a hard court because it's very different to grass. I was always thinking that grass suits me a lot more and I still believe that so to have pushed her on a hard court like that, I'm pretty proud of it."



Defending champion Jannik Sinner survived a tough test against 6ft 8" big-server Gabriel Diallo in the night session on Monday to win 6-2 7-6(6).

It was a dramatic match, briefly interrupted by a nearby fire alarm that went off in one of the court's stands, but they decided to play on after a brief delay, and Sinner saved a set point in the second set to get the job done.

But the world No. 1 admitted it was difficult to come through, and got straight back on the practice court after the match was over.

"I feel like today was a very difficult day at the office. He was serving very very well, especially in the second set. Against big servers you always have to find the right balance at the back of the court. Today I struggled a bit at times," he said after reaching the fourth round.

"But still very happy. I need these tough matches. Getting used to very difficult situations. I'm very happy this happened before a Grand Slam. Hopefully these situations I can keep for the main goal here in the US."

The stars have been feeling the heat so far at this year's Cincinnati Open, but there were worrying scenes on Monday when Arthur Rinderknech collapsed at the back of the court while facing Felix Auger-Aliassime.

The Frenchman got broken to level the score at 2-2 in the second set and walked to his towel. He went to sit down but fell onto the ground, and was quickly tended to by medics.

Rinderknech played on but got broken again and retired with Auger-Aliassime leading 7-6 4-2.



Emma Raducanu made a statement during her tight, three-set defeat to Aryna Sabalenka on Monday. The Brit proved that she can stay with the world's best players for hours without dropping her level, as Sabalenka narrowly came out on top in a final set tiebreak in their third-round showdown.

But there was one moment of madness for Raducanu, who walked closer to her new coach, Francisco Roig, for a brief chat after holding for 5-4 in the first set. Roig also got out of his chair to communicate better, and the umpire called Raducanu back before telling her they weren't allowed to approach one another.

"Emma, you cannot actively approach him and he cannot leave his position. You know that. You cannot have a conversation," Miriam Bley said.

Raducanu protested that she couldn't hear Roig over the music, but the umpire simply suggested Roig should speak louder.

"Okay, sorry, I didn't know that. Can you tell someone to tell him? I can't say it like now," the British No. 1 replied.

Grigor Dimitrov, who has been battling an injury since Wimbledon earlier this year, has officially withdrawn from the upcoming US Open.

The Bulgarian tennis star was on the brink of a significant victory over eventual champion Jannik Sinner in the round-of-16 clash but had to retire and hasn't competed since. He is the latest big name to withdraw from the tournament, which will have a record-breaking prize fund on offer. 

Dimitrov sustained a pectoral muscle injury during his match against Sinner and hasn't been able to recover in time for the tournament at Flushing Meadows later this month. This ends his streak of 58 Slam main draws in a row, the longest active streak on the ATP Tour.

With Dimitrov's withdrawal from the US Open, Alejandro Tabilo has been announced as the 34 year old's replacement.

After his withdrawal from Wimbledon, Dimitrov shared on social media: "Sometimes the heart wants to keep going... but the universe has a different plan for us," he wrote in an Instagram post that included a picture of him in a hospital bed.

"Withdrawing from this match at Wimbledon was one of the most painful moments of my career.

"Thank you for the overwhelming wave of love - from family, friends, fans, colleagues, to the entire tennis community... your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times. Thank you all. Truly. Recovery starts now. I'll see you all soon. G."

Dimitrov is not the only popular name to withdraw from the tournament, with Paula Badosa also forced to pull out due to injury.

Switzerland's Jil Teichmann was upgraded to the main draw after being the top alternate to make it into the tournament. France's Alize Cornet will then occupy the top alternate pot vacated by Teichmann. Badosa announced her tough decision on social media.

DON'T MISS: 

"It is with a heavy heart that I am announcing my withdrawal from this year's U.S. Open," she wrote. "This decision was incredibly difficult to make.

"After the amazing run I had in New York last year and the deep connection I feel with the city and its fans, stepping away from this tournament is very emotional for me. The U.S. Open has always meant a great deal to me, and I have created some of my most special memories there."

"I want to thank everyone for the ongoing support," she continued. "Right now I need to focus on my health and recovery so I can return stronger and ready to compete again."

NEW YORK (AP) — Three-time Grand Slam semifinalist Grigor Dimitrov withdrew from the U.S. Open on Tuesday, a little more than a month after he tore a chest muscle and had to quit playing against Jannik Sinner at Wimbledon.

That exit from the All England Club on July 7 — Dimitrov had taken the opening two sets against Sinner but got hurt in the third — marked the fifth consecutive Grand Slam tournament where the 34-year-old Dimitrov failed to complete a match. It also happened at the Australian Open in January and the French Open in May, plus last year's Wimbledon and U.S. Open.

A year ago in New York, Dimitrov stopped while trailing 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3, 4-1 against Frances Tiafoe in the quarterfinals.

Dimitrov was a semifinalist at the U.S. Open in 2019, at the Australian Open in 2017, and at Wimbledon in 2014.

His highest ranking was No. 3; he is currently No. 21.

With Dimitrov out of the field, Alejandro Tabilo gets a spot in the men's singles bracket, which starts play on Aug. 24.

Brandon Holt is the next player who would move into the draw if another man withdraws. Holt upset Taylor Fritz at Flushing Meadows in 2022 and his mother is two-time U.S. Open champion Tracy Austin.

Grigor Dimitrov has officially pulled out of the upcoming US Open, having struggled with an injury since Wimbledon earlier this year. The Bulgarian had been on the verge of a famous victory over eventual champion Jannik Sinner, but was forced to retire from the round-of-16 clash and hasn't been seen in competitive action since.

Dimitrov injured his pectoral muscle in the Sinner clash and has been unable to recover from the problem in time to line up at Flushing Meadows later this month. It brings to an end a streak of 58 Slam main draws in a row, which had been the longest active streak on the ATP Tour.

As a result of Dimitrov pulling out of the US Open, Alejandro Tabilo has been named as the 34-year-old's replacement. The world No.103 has competed in both the Australian and French Open main draws this year, reaching the first and second rounds respectively.

Speaking shortly after his Wimbledon withdrawal, Dimitrov posted on social media: "Sometimes the heart wants to keep going… but the universe has a different plan for us," wrote Dimitrov in a post on Instagram, which included a photo of himself in a hospital bed. Having to withdraw from this match at Wimbledon was one of the most painful moments of my career.

"Thank you for the overwhelming wave of love - from family, friends, fans, colleagues, to the entire tennis community… your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times. Thank you all. Truly. Recovery starts now. I'll see you all soon. G."

It was initially expected that Dimitrov would recover from the injury quickly, with talk of him being involved in the North American hard-court swing. However, it transpired that the original prognosis was worse than first thought, with Dimitrov firstly withdrawing from the Canadian Open and then the Cincinnati Open.

His manager, Georgi Stoimenov, appeared to float the idea of Dimitrov not being available for the US Open last month, claiming it was unlikely he'd be fully fit. Now, just a couple of weeks before the action in New York gets underway, his absence has been confirmed by the tournament organisers.

As well as losing his impressive Grand Slam streak, it's likely Dimitrov will also fall outside of the top 30 in the ATP rankings. He will have the chance to climb back up the standings at tournaments like the China Open and Shanghai Masters, but only if the Bulgarian star is fit enough to compete.

MASON, OH − The Round of 16 field for the ATP and WTA at the Cincinnati Open will be completed Aug. 12 as the third round continues from the Lindner Family Tennis Center.

The World No. 2 from both tours will be in action Aug. 12 on Center Court. Carlos Alcaraz is slated to face Hamad Medjedovic in the second match of the day session and former Cincinnati Open champion Coco Gauff is after that against No. 32 Dayana Yastremska.

Iva Jovic, a 17-year-old Lucky Loser from California, will open the day on the Grandstand Court against Barbora Krejcikova in a matchup of two players who upset their seeded opponent in the Round of 64.

Follow live as The Enquirer provides real-time updates from the third round of the Cincinnati Open.

ATP No. 9 seed Andrey Rublev lost a first-set tiebreak and fought back to beat No. 21 seed Alexei Popyrin, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (5), 7-5, to advance to the Round of 16.

Over three hours after the start of the match, and following the rain delay, Francisco Comesana has advanced to the Round of 16 at the Cincinnati Open.

Comesana beat Reilly Opelka, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-5 to become the first Argentinian man in the Cincinnati Round of 16 since 2022.

After a half-hour delay due to rain, play is set to resume shortly at the Cincinnati Open.

The opening match on Center Court is a competitive clash in the third set between Reilly Opelka and Francisco Comesana. Opelka leads 5-4 in the third set.

On Court 3, Andrey Rublev, the ATP No. 9 seed, leads 2-1 in the third set against Alexei Popyrin.

WTA No. 125 Ella Seidel has won five matches over the last seven days to reach the Cincinnati Open Round of 16.

Seidel defeated No. 29 seed McCartney Kessler on the Champions' Court 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (6).

Barbora Krejcikova has ended the Cincinnati Open run of 17-year-old Iva Jovic with a 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 victory on the Grandstand Court.

Coco Gauff will not take Center Court at the Cincinnati Open Aug. 12.

The WTA No. 2 has advanced to the Round of 16 after her opponent, Dayana Yastremska, withdrew from the tournament due to an illness.

Day 8 of the Cincinnati Open is underway in Mason. On Center Court, ATP No. 73 Reilly Opelka is looking to advance to his first ATP 1000 Round of 16 since 2022.

Opelka trails Francisco Comesana 3-2 in the first set.

The Tennis Channel is the exclusive home of the Cincinnati Open.

The Tennis Channel app is available on iOS, Android, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Roku. Subscriptions start at $9.99 a month, up to $109.99 a year.

The Tennis Channel is also available to stream on Fubo.

There are three WTA matches Aug. 12 between a pair of seeded opponents. After Gauff-Yastremska, No. 4 Jessica Pegula squares off against No. 31 seed Magda Linette on Center Court.

Earlier in the day on the Grandstand Court, No. 7 Jasmine Paolini battles No. 26 Ashlyn Krueger.

There is only one such match on the ATP side. No. 27 seed Brandon Nakashima opens the night session against No. 3 Alexander Zverev.

Both Cincinnati natives from the WTA are through to the second round in the doubles draw. Peyton Stearns and partner Marketa Vondrousova will battle the team of Timea Babos-Luisa Stefani in the night session.

Jannik Sinner's 2025 ATP Tour campaign has been one for the ages, as he continues to dominate the men's game.

In January, Sinner won his third Grand Slam title at the Australian Open, defeating Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6, 6-3, in the final.

He then encountered one of the biggest setbacks of his career, as Sinner was suspended for three months, bringing an end to the ‘Clostebol' saga.

Returning on the clay, Sinner reached the final of the Italian Open and French Open, but came up short against Carlos Alcaraz on both occasions.

Finally getting one over on his biggest rival, Sinner defeated Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final to win his second major of the year.

Sitting pretty atop the ATP rankings, with two of the three Grand Slams in his back pocket, things couldn't be going much better for Sinner, although that's not to say he hasn't been embroiled in controversy.

Sinner's fellow Italian and national tennis hero, Nicola Pietrangeli, has made several comments about the world number one that haven't gone down well.

However, looking to clarify his thoughts on Sinner, Pietrangeli has now claimed that the media were twisting his words.

During an interview with Super Tennis, Italian tennis legend Pietrangeli suggested the media have been forcing a false narrative about him and Sinner.

“Interviews? They change my words, that's enough,” he said.

“You know, in the end, what I don't understand is how people can think I want to speak badly of [Jannik] Sinner because I'm jealous.

“But why? Why should I speak badly of him? How dare they?”

Recently discharged from hospital, Pietrangeli made a joke about the costs of healthcare, referring to Sinner once more.

“Everything they tell me has a cost,” he said.

“But I'm not as rich as Sinner… and I'm just joking because I can already see they're going to start another controversy.”

During an interview last November, Pietrangeli claimed Sinner would never break his Davis Cup record, suggesting he would need ‘three or four lifetimes' to do so.

Pietrangeli holds the record for most Davis Cup matches played and won, which, in fairness, is likely to stand the test of time.

Earlier this year, when the 23-year-old won his second consecutive Australian Open title, Pietrangeli suggested Sinner's win over Zverev was ‘boring'.

Whilst the headline quotes don't always paint Pietrangeli in the best light, in his defense, he does often qualify such statements with praise for the Italian world number one.

The 91-year-old clearly has a lot of respect for Sinner, as the youngster builds on the legacy he started in 1959.

At the 1959 French Open, Pietrangeli became the first Italian player to win a major title, defeating Ian Vermaak in the final.

Defending his title a year later, Pietrangeli eventually retired with two Grand Slam titles to his name.

65 years on, Italian players have won seven more majors, as the nation begins to establish itself as a true tennis superpower.

As a country, Italy has won nine Grand Slam titles, a number that is likely to increase over the coming years.

Not only is Sinner a threat at all four majors, but Jasmine Paolini and Lorenzo Musetti have both shown how dangerous they can be on clay and grass courts over the past 18 months.

Whether any of the trio can add a tenth Grand Slam title to their nation's tally in New York next month remains to be seen, but it will certainly be worth tuning in for.

The 2025 US Open is scheduled to begin on Sunday, August 24.

Jack Draper reveals he discovered an arm issue following his shock Wimbledon exit but has since returned to being fully healthy and highlights he is not lacking any motivation ahead of the US Open.

After Draper collected his maiden Masters crown in Indian Wells and broke into the top-5, high hopes were placed on him at Wimbledon. Those hopes of seeing the world No. 5 do well at The Championships were quickly squashed after he suffered a surprise second-round loss to Marin Cilic.

While Draper took all the responsibility and blame for his Wimbledon display, he later withdrew from the Masters tournaments in Toronto and Cincinnati, citing an injury. Now, in an interview with LTA, the 23-year-old said that after The Championships, he found out that he had been playing with an arm injury "for a little while."

“The doctors and my team advised me that I'd need to take some time out. I had a few days off, so I chilled and took my mind off tennis. Then I was really motivated to come back and do a really good fitness block and work myself hard physically to make some good gains," the world No. 5 told LTA.

After taking some time for himself and fixing his arm issue, Draper says he is in "a great place" now and ecstatic about taking to the US Open courts.   “I got back to my tennis slowly to protect my arm, but it's been a really productive few weeks now. It was disappointing to miss Toronto and Cincinnati, but I think it's been a good period for me to reflect on things and improve. I'm really looking forward to going out to the US Open, and I'm in a great place personally and tennis-wise. I feel refreshed, motivated, and I can't wait to get back out there," the Briton added.

Last year, Draper made his maiden Grand Slam semifinal at the US Open before losing to eventual champion Jannik Sinner. The world No. 5 not playing any matches ahead of the US Open definitely isn't ideal, but at least he is guaranteed to arrive to New York fresh and healthy.

Lizzy Banks, a professional women's cyclist who had failed a drugs test and was eventually given a two-year ban, says she struggled to watch Jannik Sinner play the Wimbledon final. 

“I can't tell you how difficult it was to watch Wimbledon this year. I watched the men's final and I didn't expect it to hit me like that, I was so upset. I want to make it clear that I don't think Jannik Sinner purposely took anything. He was given his zero-month sanction, like I was. It was appealed to CAS, like mine was. And then he got the most handy time, a three-month sanction, and then he was able to just go straight back to it,” Banks told The Times. “I was never even offered a deal, but I wouldn't have taken it anyway.

Her reaction was because of how her own career played out because of that ban. Initially, she was given no ban as UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) had agreed that there had been contamination and it was no fault of hers. But WADA refused to accept the opinion of UKAD's expert witness, professor David Cowan, and instead fought for and secured a two-year ban later. 

Her ordeal began in May 2023 when she took a routine urine test that led to a positive finding for a diuretic called Chrortalidone, which she claims she had not even heard of before. Her conclusion, and which was supported by the professor Cowan after his investigations, was that one of medications she took to treat asthma or a pill she took after a dental treatment perhaps had been contaminated in the manufacturing process. 

But CAS panel didn't agree to her version and though they described her as a “peroson of integrity”, said that she was unable to prove the source of the contamination and hence warranted a ban, which was back-dated and is now served. 

It's for this reason that she struggled to watch Sinner play and win Wimbledon. “Then they came out and said this case [Sinner's] is a million miles from doping. Well, how does that make me feel? Just because I'm little old me and nobody cares about me I have to go through hell, and he gets to go and win Wimbledon.”

She told The Times newspaper about how her life was completely upset after the ban. “I was an athlete of integrity who took the utmost care in her anti-doping responsibilities, who was unknowingly exposed to a contaminant-sized dose of an obsolete diuretic with an impossibility of tracing the source because of a 79-day delay. And so is that really proportional to my career being completely lost, my identity being lost, my health being destroyed for two years, my husband's health being destroyed for two years, loss of earnings for two years, the impact that will have on other earnings in the future. Is that proportional?”

The rivalry continues to heat up between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz.

In 2024, the youngsters left no doubt they are the world's two best players by sharing the Grand Slams between them, and the trend has continued in 2025.

In their latest battle, Sinner defeated Alcaraz to become the Wimbledon champion for the first time.

With the tennis circuit now on the road to the US Open, Sinner, the defending champion at Flushing Meadows, will be under threat from Carlos Alcaraz not only for the title, but his world number one ranking.

Jannik Sinner has been at the summit of the ATP rankings since June 2024, when he overtook Novak Djokovic.

The Italian currently has a 3440-point lead over world number two Alcaraz, but the Spaniard currently leads the race to the ATP Finals in Turin.

Should Alcaraz win the US Open and Sinner lose early, the points deficit could swing in his favour and with three months of the season remaining, the 22-year-old has every chance of reaching the top of the ATP rankings by the end of the year.

Furthermore, Steve Johnson of the ‘Nothing Major' podcast thinks Alcaraz will usurp Sinner at the top of the rankings by the end of the year.

“I think Carlos ends the year as number one and he also had a three month head start,” Johnson said. “Sinner was out for four Masters series, so I just think he gets him. But it entirely depends on the big events. You win the Open and it's 2000 points.

“One of these guys loses kind of early. You lose in the quarters and somebody wins it and they are going to get a 1500 point head start just from that event.

“But I think Carlos gets him at the end of the year. I think after his loss at Wimbledon, I think that was a kick in the pants for him to be like I need to be better.”

Alcaraz and Sinner's rivalry went up a level this season, as each of their three matches in 2025 have taken place in the final.

Two of these matches occurred in the finals of Grand Slams. Alcaraz won a classic match at the French Open, while Sinner won their Wimbledon encounter in four sets.

There is every chance the pair could square off in the US Open final in September, but while that remains to be seen, Johnson thinks there will be at least two more Sinner and Alcaraz matches in 2025.

“These guys are pushing each other. They see what they are doing, it's the same with Roger, Rafa and Novak. They push each other to get better,” Johnson said.

“So he sees how good Jannik is playing on hard courts. He is going to solely work on how to beat Jannik, because he feels like he can beat everybody else on Tour.

“This is going to be a great rivalry and I think we are going to see them in a couple more finals throughout the year. I would love to see them in the US Open final, that would be electric, but we are a long way from that.”

Jessica Pegula is excited about playing in the new US Open mixed doubles event but that doesn't mean she is perfectly fine with the changes made, as the American criticized the tournament organizers over a "rogue" move and urged them to next time communicate more with players before taking a drastic decision.

After it had been speculated for some time, the US Open organizers officially confirmed it in February when they revealed their completely revamped mixed doubles format. This year, a total of 16 teams will take part in a two-day event - eight teams made the tournament directly, while eight entered via a wildcard - the focus is on top singles players participating and the winning duo will take a historic $1 million prize money. 

To make sure they'd have a strong player field consisting of top ATP and WTA players, the organizers decided to schedule the doubles event for the qualifying week and that's why the event will take place between August 19-20. And they were successful in their goal since the majority of top-10 male and female stars signed up for the event.

However, it also drew a major backlash from doubles-oriented players, who ripped the US Open's move as "disrespectful to the game." Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori - last year's champions - declared the decision "a profound injustice."

"I'm honored that they asked me to play. It's going to be great, it's going to be fun and the fans will really enjoy it. At the same time, how they went about it, I didn't think was really great ... We were like, +Okay, you guys went rogue and changed the format and didn't tell anybody.' You just did it," Pegula said.

"Did you talk to the players? Did you get their input about how it could be better? That's something that we as players are trying to work with them on, having that line of communication be a lot smoother. I feel like maybe if there was feedback about the format, then the (reaction) would be a little different, not so all over the place."

In the same interview, Pegula said it definitely wasn't a good look when some players started complaining that they were stripped of their job and a chance to make money.

Meanwhile, Pegula's US Open mixed doubles partner is world No. 16 Tommy Paul.

                            • 3 MINUTE READ
                    

Last year, British No.1 Jack Draper headed to the US Open on a hot streak, having made the quarter-finals at the Cincinnati Open just the week before.



Draper's run to the final four last year truly catapulted his status as one of the top players in the game right now. His wins over the likes of Botic van de Zandschulp, Tomas Mahac, and Alex de Minaur showed that he had the game and mentality to go deep in the major championships and challenge for the biggest titles.

Reflecting on last year's performances, despite the semi-final exit to world No.1 and eventual champion Jannik Sinner, Draper sees that run as the catalyst for what has so far been his most successful season on tour.

“Last year's US Open was amazing – I reflect on it with really positive memories. It gave me so much confidence and set me up for what was to come for the rest of the year and also the start of this year.

“Pushing through five best-of-five set matches, against the best players in the world on the biggest stages – that just gives me so much belief. It was a big moment for me and probably one of the biggest in my career so far.

“For me, the atmosphere is the best at the US Open. I love the crowd dynamic, the rowdiness, and I just really enjoy the surroundings and what it brings. It's a lively, energetic crowd, and that gets the best out of me for sure.”

Standing in his way last year and likely again this time around will be current US Open, Australian Open, and Wimbledon title-holder Sinner, alongside Roland Garros champion Carlos Alcaraz.

Sinner and Alcaraz have dominated the men's game over the last two years, lifting the last seven major titles between them and showing little sign of stopping. They have faced each other in the two most recent Grand Slams finals and are staking their claim at the summit of the sport.

Now it's up to the rest of the field to raise their game to overthrow Sinner and Alcaraz – and Draper is very much leading that charge. The Brit has defeated both players in the past and believes he has what it takes to join them at the top.



“Jannik and Carlos are the best two players in the world right now,” Draper said. “They are playing tennis, which is very exciting to watch; it's electric.

“There are no holes in their game; they are so consistent and powerful. Mentally, they are both very experienced now on the big stages, and they are both complete players. Saying that, they can still improve, so it's really exciting to be around them.

“They are leading the way, but there are players like me who are hungry to go beyond their level and will do anything to get to where they are playing. I'm looking forward to many more matchups with them to come.”

While the US Open is the last Grand Slam of the year, it's certainly not the final big trophy up for grabs over the coming months.

In November, the season will close out with the Nitto ATP Finals – bringing together the top eight singles players and doubles teams from the year to crown the final champions of 2025.

Currently, Draper is ranked No.7 in the Race to Turin, and a good showing at the US Open could book his place at the Finals for the first time in his career – a significant milestone as a reward for his impressive results this year.

“The ATP Finals is definitely something I've got my eyes on,” he admitted. “At the start of the year, it was one of my goals because if you make the Finals, you've had a very consistent season, and that was my biggest thing going into this season to maintain.

“Obviously, I've picked up an injury and missed a few tournaments, but like always, I'm going to give it my best. My preparation has been great, I keep on improving, and if I make it, great, but if I don't, life moves on, and I'll keep striving to be better.”

Swiatek: ‘I'm just proud of myself'

Top-ranked Iga Swiatek has beaten 18-year-old American Coco Gauff 6-1, 6-3 in the French Open final to collect her second title at Roland Garros and stretch her winning streak to 35 matches.

Swiatek's unbeaten run equals one by Venus Williams in 2000 as the longest this century.





Swiatek's victory over Gauff on Saturday allowed her to add to the 2020 trophy she won in Paris. That made her the first player from Poland to win a Grand Slam singles title. Swiatek has now won her past six tournaments and is 42-3 this season. Swiatek's last loss came in February to 2017 Roland Garros champion Jelena Ostapenko.

Swiatek is unbeaten since February and sure looks unbeatable at the moment. Gauff, appearing in her first Grand Slam final at just 18, never stood much of a chance, like most opponents against Swiatek lately.

The year's final Grand Slam announced in February that its mixed doubles competition, which will offer $1 million in prize money, would take place from August 19-20 ahead of the singles main draw the following week.

The competition's format was also overhauled to feature a field of 16 teams - half of the 32 teams that competed last year - with eight entries based on the combined singles rankings of players and eight wildcards.

Matches will be best of three sets, with short sets to four games, with no-advantage scoring, tiebreakers at four-all and a 10-point tiebreak in lieu of a third set. The final will be a best-of-three set match to six games.

The move was described by defending US Open champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori as a "profound injustice" to doubles players, and Pegula, who is part of the WTA Player Council, said more communication was needed between organisers and players.

"I'm honoured that they asked me to play. It's going to be great, it's going to be fun and the fans will really enjoy it," Pegula told reporters at the ongoing Cincinnati Open.

"At the same time, how they went about it, I didn't think was really great ... We were like, Okay, you guys went rogue and changed the format and didn't tell anybody. You just did it.

"Did you talk to the players? Did you get their input about how it could be better? That's something that we as players are trying to work with them on, having that line of communication be a lot smoother.

"I feel like maybe if there was feedback about the format, then the (reaction) would be a little different, not so all over the place."

The US Open said previously it understood the feedback from players but stressed that the reimagined event will elevate mixed doubles with a bigger spotlight and inspire more people to play the sport.

Pegula, who will team up with fellow American Tommy Paul in the competition that also features pairs such as Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu and Jannik Sinner and Emma Navarro, said the move to limit the field could impact doubles players' earnings.

"It's not good when you have players saying they're upset that now they can't play, or that it's a way for them to make money and now they don't have that," Pegula added.

"It's going to be a really fun event, but at the same time, I wish that they would have been communicating with us a little bit better."

CINCINNATI, Ohio — As the countdown to the US Open—and its polarizing mixed doubles event—continues, Jessica Pegula says a lack of communication between players and organizers is at the heart of the divide.The American No. 4 seed spoke after her second-round victory at the Cincinnati Open on Sunday, where she defeated Kimberly Birrell 6-4, 6-3. Pegula, who will team up with Tommy Paul at the revamped two-day tournament, said players weren't consulted before the major overhaul was announced.Read More: Katerina Siniakova, doubles No. 1, on not making US Open cutoff: "Nothing more to say"“I'm honored that they asked me to play.

The US Open revealed the new format in February. The event will now take place during Fan Week over two days, with abbreviated “Fast 4” scoring. The most controversial change is the limited field of 16 teams—eight direct entries based on singles rankings, not doubles, and eight wild cards, a mix of fan favorites and doubles champions.Pegula, a member of the WTA's Player Council who co-signed a letter to the four Grand Slams calling for a greater share of profits for players, welcomed the initiative but said the lack of communication left players blindsided.Read More: US Open breathes new life into mixed doubles format with Fan Week revamp“We were like, Okay, you guys (US Open) just went rogue and changed the format and didn't tell anybody.

Player feedback has been mixed, with many doubles specialists strongly opposed. Because of the singles ranking requirement, many top doubles players are effectively locked out—for example, doubles world No. 2 Katerina Siniakova, the reigning Wimbledon mixed champion, and ATP No. 1 Marcelo Arevalo would need a wild card to enter.Six of the eight wild cards have already been awarded, with Carlos Alcaraz-Emma Raducanu, Venus Williams-Reilly Opelka and Novak Djokovic-Olga Danilovic among the pairs confirmed. Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, the Roland Garros mixed doubles champions, are the only team so far made up of dedicated doubles players.Read More: Mixed doubles madness!

Adding to the strain is the schedule, which sees the mixed doubles event start on Tuesday—just one day after the Cincinnati Open's Monday final. It's a tight turnaround in a packed summer calendar that already featured the Canadian Open concluding on Thursday and Cincinnati's main draw starting the same day.“The two weeks, I feel like it's crushing a lot of the players a little bit,” Pegula said. “Obviously, yes, (they can) make more money, and our prize money may be a little bit higher and stuff like that—but it's kind of, like, at what expense?”Through to the third round in Cincinnati, No. 4 seed Pegula will face No. 31 seed Magda Linette on Tuesday.

CINCINNATI, Ohio — As the countdown to the US Open—and its polarizing mixed doubles event—continues, Jessica Pegula says a lack of communication between players and organizers is at the heart of the divide.The American No. 4 seed spoke after her second-round victory at the Cincinnati Open on Sunday, where she defeated Kimberly Birrell 6-4, 6-3. Pegula, who will team up with Tommy Paul at the revamped two-day tournament, said players weren't consulted before the major overhaul was announced.Read More: Katerina Siniakova, doubles No. 1, on not making US Open cutoff: "Nothing more to say"“I'm honored that they asked me to play. I think it's going to be great, I think it's going to be fun and I think the fans will really enjoy it,” Pegula told press in a mixed zone interview. “At the same time, how they went about it, I didn't think was really great.”

The US Open revealed the new format in February. The event will now take place during Fan Week over two days, with abbreviated “Fast 4” scoring. The most controversial change is the limited field of 16 teams—eight direct entries based on singles rankings, not doubles, and eight wild cards, a mix of fan favorites and doubles champions.Pegula, a member of the WTA's Player Council who co-signed a letter to the four Grand Slams calling for a greater share of profits for players, welcomed the initiative but said the lack of communication left players blindsided.Read More: US Open breathes new life into mixed doubles format with Fan Week revamp“We were like, Okay, you guys (US Open) just went rogue and changed the format and didn't tell anybody. You just kind of did it,” Pegula explained.“What do you even know? Did you talk to the players? Did you get their input about how it could be better? I think that's just something that we as players are trying to work with them on, having that line of communication be a lot smoother.“I feel like maybe if there was feedback about the format, then the (reaction) would be a little different, not so all over the place.”

Player feedback has been mixed, with many doubles specialists strongly opposed. Because of the singles ranking requirement, many top doubles players are effectively locked out—for example, doubles world No. 2 Katerina Siniakova, the reigning Wimbledon mixed champion, and ATP No. 1 Marcelo Arevalo would need a wild card to enter.Six of the eight wild cards have already been awarded, with Carlos Alcaraz-Emma Raducanu, Venus Williams-Reilly Opelka and Novak Djokovic-Olga Danilovic among the pairs confirmed. Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, the Roland Garros mixed doubles champions, are the only team so far made up of dedicated doubles players.Read More: Mixed doubles madness!

Adding to the strain is the schedule, which sees the mixed doubles event start on Tuesday—just one day after the Cincinnati Open's Monday final. It's a tight turnaround in a packed summer calendar that already featured the Canadian Open concluding on Thursday and Cincinnati's main draw starting the same day.“The two weeks, I feel like it's crushing a lot of the players a little bit,” Pegula said. “Obviously, yes, (they can) make more money, and our prize money may be a little bit higher and stuff like that—but it's kind of, like, at what expense?”Through to the third round in Cincinnati, No. 4 seed Pegula will face No. 31 seed Magda Linette on Tuesday.

Third round singles action continues on Tuesday.

Last month at Wimbledon, Coco Gauff was upset in the first round by Dayana Yastremska.  On Tuesday, they meet again in the third round of the Cincinnati Open.

Plus, Carlos Alcaraz, Jessica Pegula, and Jasmine Paolini will alsoplay their third round matches.  And in a battle between two Masters 1000 champions, Andrey Rublev takes on Alexei Popyrin.

Throughout the tournament, this preview will analyze the day's two most prominent matches, while highlighting the other notable matches on the schedule.  Tuesday's play gets underway at 11:00am local time.



Alexei Popyrin (21) vs. Andrey Rublev (9) – 11:00am on Court 3

Rublev's two Masters 1000 titles both came on clay, though he was a finalist four years ago in Cincinnati.  However, across the past 52 weeks, he's just 7-9 at Masters level, and just 8-4 at Majors.  But he did reach the quarterfinals last week in Canada, and in his opening round on Sunday, avenged a recent loss in Washington against Learner Tien.

Popyrin was the surprise champion last summer in Canada, and also reached the quarterfinals last week, eventually losing a tight match to third-seeded Alexander Zverev.  The Australian also achieved a quarterfinal here two years ago, yet this year he's struggled, and owns a losing record.  Perhaps no longer having the defense of the Canada points looming over him will free up Alexei's play.

And Popyrin has actually taken two of three meetings with Rublev, which includes the final of Canada, Alexei's biggest win of his career.  Both players possess formidable forehands, but Popyrin is the one with the bigger serve.  Having won their last two matches, I give Alexei the slight edge to prevail again on Tuesday.



Dayana Yastremska (32) vs. Coco Gauff (2) – Not Before 3:00pm on Center Court

In the first round of The Championships, Gauff fell in straight sets to Yastremska, as grass continues to trouble the two-time Major singles champion.  On a surface that invites winners, Coco struck only six in that match, and committed 29 unforced errors.  Then in Montreal, Gauff's service woes resurfaced, hitting as many as 23 double faults in a match.  Yet the 2025 champion played well on Sunday, defeating Xinyu Wang 6-3, 6-2, just weeks after the same player upset Coco on grass in Berlin.

Yastremska is now 31-17 on the year, and has advanced to a pair of WTA finals, in Linz and Nottingham.  But as per Tennis Abstract, her Wimbledon victory over Gauff was her first top 10 win in 18 months.  Dayana has a pretty big game, but she can also become error-prone at times, and she does not possess the same great movement that Coco has.

Prior to their Wimbledon matchup, Gauff has claimed their other three encounters, though she did bizarrely drop the first set to Yastremska this past April in Madrid by a score of 6-0.  While the fast-playing conditions in Cincy are to Dayana's liking, I still favor Coco to avenge a recent loss for the second consecutive round.



Other Notable Matches on Tuesday:

Hamad Medjedovic vs. Carlos Alcaraz (2) – As has been the theme of his season, Alcaraz did not play his best tennis in his opening round on Sunday, yet still managed to beat Damir Dzumhur in three sets.  This is his first encounter with Medjedovic, who upset 26th-seeded Tallon Griekspoor in the last round.

Jasmine Paolini (7) vs.  Ashlyn Krueger (26) – Paolini defeated Maria Sakkari on Sunday via a pair of sets decided by tiebreaks.  On the same, Krueger required three sets to overcome Anastasija Sevastova, as the 21-year-old American now looks to equal her best WTA 1000 result to date by advancing to the fourth round.  This is a first-time meeting.

Magda Linette (31) vs. Jessica Pegula (4) – Pegula defeated Kimberly Birrell in straights in her opening round, to record just her second victory since the start of Wimbledon.  She is 3-0 against Linette, and has claimed all six sets they've contested.

Brandon Nakashima (26) vs. Sascha Zverev (3) – Zverev has reached the semifinals or better in his last three Cincinnati appearances, taking the title back in 2021.  He has won all four times he's faced Nakashima, though all four matches have been pretty tight.

French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz will take on Hamad Medjedovic at the Cincinnati Masters on Tuesday. The third-round schedule also includes a showdown between Andrey Rublev and Alexei Popyrin.

(2) Carlos Alcaraz vs. Hamad Medjedovic

Carlos Alcaraz hasn't played an event since he lost the Wimbledon final to Jannik Sinner–and it showed in his second-round win over Damir Dzumhur at the Western & Southern Open. The Spaniard was scratchy, dropping the second set before he righted the ship in the third. Cincinnati will be Alcaraz's only event prior to the U.S. Open in a couple of weeks.

Hamad Medjedovic is ranked 72nd in the world. The Serb's best result of the season (by far) came on the hard courts of Marseille, where he lost in the final to Ugo Humbert. Like Alcaraz, Medjedovic has played no other events since Wimbledon; unlike Alcaraz, he lost in the opening round at the All-England Club. His best results have come on hard courts, but a player of Alcaraz's caliber is going to be a big ask. Despite Alcaraz's slow start to the North American hard-court swing, look for him to advance in straight sets.

(9) Andrey Rublev vs. (21) Alexei Popyrin

Andrey Rublev has endured an inconsistent season. The world No. 11 won the title in Doha, but his Grand Slam results have been lackluster. He was knocked out of the Australian Open in the first round and in the round of 16 at the French Open and Wimbledon. Rublev plays a ton of tennis; Cincinnati marks his 20th tournament of the season.

Unfortunately for Rublev, Alexei Popyrin is a known quantity for the Russian. Popyrin won their two most recent matches, both in 2024 in Monte Carlo and Montreal. Rublev is a player whose results reflect how much confidence–or lack thereof–he has. He at least made a good run to the quarters last week in Toronto, which bodes well for his form in Cincy. Interestingly, Popyrin also made the quarters in Toronto. He upset Daniil Medvedev and Holger Rune last week, so he will be playing with confidence. With both men in decent enough form, look for this one to go the distance.

Nine's Wide World of Sports

Emma Raducanu complained to the umpire about a crying child and was applauded by sections of the crowd in her narrow third round loss to world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka in Cincinnati.

It was the pair's second meeting of the year after Sabalenka edged the Brit in their third-round encounter at Wimbledon, but this one had more spice.

With the match all square at one set apiece and with Raducanu serving at 3-4 in the third, tensions rose as the Brit was forced to fight off several break points.

At one point as she stepped up to serve, the 2021 US Open champion stopped her motion when a child cried out. She turned to the umpire and said: "It's been, like, 10 minutes."

Emma Raducanu complains to the umpire. X

The umpire replied: "It's a child. Do you want me to kick the child out of the stadium?"

When members of the crowd replied "yes", the British No.1 shrugged and smiled.

As Raducanu towelled herself, the umpire said: "I can call in, but we need to continue for the moment."

The tense clash continued and Raducanu ended up holding her serve to level the scores at 4-4 in the third.

Both players held serve until it went to a tiebreak in the final set, with Sabalenka pulling through to win it 7-5.

Sabalenka took the match 7-6(3), 4-6, 7-6(5).

"Happy to get through this match," Sabalenka said in her on-court interview. "I really hope I have a day tomorrow."

Raducanu opened the match by winning eight straight points. but a double fault on the ninth point swung things for Sabalenka, who took the first frame in around an hour.

Another close contest followed in the second as both players held their serve in the early stages, before Raducanu managed to shift the momentum by winning a break point in the seventh game to take the lead and eventually the set, 6-4.

Sabalenka has now won all three career meetings with Raducanu, who has lost 11 of 12 matches against top five players.

She's currently working with Francisco Roig, who coached Rafael Nadal from 2005-2022.

The post Coco Gauff reflects on Wimbledon upset before Cincinatti Open rematch appeared first on ClutchPoints.

One week ago, Coco Gauff lost in the National Bank Open in Montreal. But as she goes through the Cincinnati Open, she looks back at her most disappointing loss.

In June, No. 2 Gauff lost in the first round at Wimbledon to No. 42 Dayana Yastremska. Now she is set to take on Yastremska in the third round at Cincinnati. She defeated Wang Xinyu (6-3, 6-2) in the second round on Sunday.

Gauff is looking ahead to the challenge with the proper mindset, per Peter Lynch of The Tennis Gazette.

“I don't ever think of revenge-type tennis,” she said. “At first I used to think like that but then I am like I have to play too many people too many times to have a revenge mindset.“

“I think for me it's a good measure to see where my game is. I thought that Wimbledon match was a tough loss for me and I don't think I approached it well.

Upon reflection, Gauff compliments Yastremska for being a formidable opponent.

“I always have trouble against her, she is a tough opponent, great ball striker who can pull winners out of anywhere” she said.

“So it will be a tough test for me, especially having to play her again, but I think I have had more time to work on things in the hard court season and I definitely think it's a better surface than grass for me.

As for the upcoming match, Gauff exuded confidence in her abilities.

“So it's going to be a tough match but I am looking forward to it and hopefully I can do better than Wimby” Gauff said.

Gauff is looking to recapture the magic she had in winning in the French Open.

In 2023, Gauff won her first Cincinnati Open, her first WTA 1000 singles title. The victory opened the door into what Gauff had in the making as a top-notch professional player.

A few weeks later, Gauff dramatically won the U.S. Open. In 2024, Gauff lost in the third round of the Cincinnati Open to Yulia Putintseva (6-4, 2-6, 6-4).

It was also during the Cincinnati Open that Gauff solidified herself as a fashion icon. This year, she represented two brands, New Balance x Miu Miu collaboration.

2025 season: The story so far

As the 2025 season takes a breather, F1.com takes a look back at the championship fight so far between McLaren team mates Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

The 2025 season has featured several fascinating storylines so far – and one of these has centred around the increasingly close intra-team championship fight that has been playing out between McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

From Round 1 in Australia through to the last race before F1's traditional summer break in Hungary, the battle has seen its fair share of changes in momentum – as well as a dramatic collision along the way.

We've been taking a look back at how the duel has unfolded throughout the first half of the campaign – with plenty more to come when the action resumes at the end of August…

When the season kicked off at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, Norris laid down an early marker by beating Piastri to pole position.

While Piastri remained on the tail of his team mate during the first half of Sunday's race, heavy rainfall in the latter stages resulted in the home hero running off the track, dropping him down the order in the process.

Throughout the hectic final stages, Norris held position to take victory by just 0.895s from Red Bull's Max Verstappen, with Piastri having to settle for ninth place.

Piastri was looking for a better outing when F1 moved on to Shanghai one week later – and while McLaren lost out to the Ferrari of Lewis Hamilton in Saturday's Sprint, Piastri grabbed pole position in Qualifying.

Despite a challenge from Mercedes' George Russell at the start, the driver from Melbourne looked in commanding form as he led throughout before claiming his first win of the season.

Norris, meanwhile, reported an issue with his brakes during the latter stages but held onto second place, giving the Woking-based squad a 1-2 finish.

Norris and Piastri dominated the top of the free practice timesheets when Formula 1 arrived at Japan's Suzuka Circuit. However, Verstappen caused a surprise by outpacing both to secure pole position.

While there was a close moment between Verstappen and Norris when both emerged from the pit exit at the same time during Sunday's race, the Dutchman remained ahead and ultimately became the third different winner in as many Grands Prix.

The final 10 laps saw Piastri close in on Norris during the battle for P2 before his challenge fell away towards the end, meaning that Norris led home his team mate in a 2-3 formation.

After the opening three races, Norris led the championship by one point from Verstappen, with Piastri 13 points adrift in third. But it was Piastri who enjoyed a stronger Qualifying at Round 4 in Bahrain, the Australian taking pole while Norris ended the session back in sixth.

From there it proved to be an impressive weekend for Piastri, who built a strong lead on race day before eventually crossing the line with a sizeable 15-second margin from Russell in P2.

Norris' good recovery drive saw him complete the podium in third, but the Briton had lost a fair bit of ground to his team mate in the championship, with Piastri having leapfrogged Verstappen to move just three points behind Norris.

After topping second and third practice in Saudi Arabia, Norris looked in promising form entering into Qualifying – but things unravelled for the Briton when a hefty crash in Q3 put him out of the session and left him down in P10 on the grid.

Piastri, meanwhile, lined up in second behind polesitter Verstappen. An early battle between the pair resulted in Verstappen being handed a five-second time penalty, dropping him behind the Australian who went on to claim a mostly untroubled win from there.

While Norris recovered to a final result of P4, Piastri's victory was enough to steal the championship lead from his team mate, making him the first Australian to head the standings in 15 years.

The Miami Grand Prix was the scene of Norris' debut win in 2024 and the British driver proved victorious at the track again during this year's Sprint, with a well-timed pit stop bringing him out ahead of Piastri.

That run did not continue into Sunday's race, however. With Verstappen taking pole ahead of Norris – and Piastri back in fourth – a mistake from Norris at the start dropped him back, while Piastri moved forwards and eventually overtook Verstappen for the lead.

Norris climbed back up to second and helped McLaren to seal another dominant 1-2, allowing Piastri to strengthen his championship lead in the process.

Piastri was again the man to beat in Qualifying for the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, the Australian clinching pole position while Norris ended the session in fourth.

It was second-placed Verstappen who starred on race day, however, with the Red Bull man making a stunning move on Piastri to take the lead on Lap 1.

The Dutchman went on to win, while Norris finished ahead of Piastri in second. This put the gap between them in the championship at 13 points.

Charles Leclerc topped the timesheets of every practice session during his home race weekend in Monaco – but Norris beat the Ferrari driver to pole position in Qualifying.

On Sunday the Briton held that position through Virtual Safety Car phases and a mandated two-stop strategy rule to claim his first Grand Prix win since the beginning of the season.

While Piastri joined him on the podium in third, the 24-year-old's championship lead had been cut to just three points.

The momentum swung back to Piastri as F1 returned to the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya for Round 9 of the season.

After beating Norris to P1 on the grid in Qualifying, the championship leader returned to the top step of the rostrum on race day.

Norris was not far behind, with the team securing another 1-2, but Piastri had eked out his title standings advantage to 10 points.

Entering into the Canadian Grand Prix weekend, Norris admitted that it was a case of “when” not “if” he and Piastri would come to blows on track during the battle for the World Championship.

Within a matter of days, that prediction had proven accurate. After a slightly weaker weekend for the squad in general, Norris was chasing down his team mate in a scrap for fourth during the closing stages of the race.

Contact occurred between them, resulting in Norris – who took responsibility for the incident – pulling off track with damage, while Piastri crossed the line in fourth. It was an incident that McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella labelled as “not acceptable”.

Off the back of that incident in Montreal, Norris appeared keen to bounce back at the next round in Austria, having set the pace in second and third practice before grabbing pole position in Qualifying, with Piastri placing in third.

What followed on Sunday was a thrilling race-long duel between the McLaren duo as they fought for the lead, Piastri remaining hot on Norris' tail throughout much of the Grand Prix.

Norris ultimately kept his team mate at bay by 2.695s to seal his third win of the campaign – and, after his non-score in Canada, the Briton was now 15 points off in the championship fight.

Verstappen again beat both McLarens to pole position at Silverstone – but a dramatic Grand Prix saw the order change.

In an eventful wet-dry race, Piastri overtook Verstappen for P1 just as rain started to fall. The Australian was later hit with a 10-second time penalty for slowing too much when preparing for a restart following a Safety Car period, handing the lead to Norris during the pit stops phase.

From there Norris claimed victory in front of his home crowd, with Piastri coming home in a slightly less happy second. His title lead had again been reduced, with the margin now down to eight points.

The Sprint spoils went to Verstappen as F1 arrived at Spa-Francorchamps for Round 13, the Dutchman having overtaken pole man Piastri in the early stages – but it was a fight between the McLaren pair when it came to Qualifying.

Norris outpaced Piastri by just 0.085s to claim pole. However, after a delay to Sunday's race due to heavy rainfall, Piastri was on the charge when racing eventually got underway and made a bold move on his team mate along the Kemmel Straight to take the lead.

While Norris went on the pursuit in the latter stages, he ultimately crossed the line just over three seconds adrift of Piastri – and, with that, the Australian had stretched his championship lead out again to 16 points.

Hungary hosted the final round of the campaign prior to the sport's traditional summer break – a venue that was also the scene of Piastri's first Grand Prix victory 12 months earlier.

Qualifying threw up a surprise result when Leclerc grabbed an unexpected pole, and the Monegasque initially led for the early stages of the race. However, while Norris had fallen away at the start, an alternative one-stop strategy put the Briton ahead of both Leclerc and Piastri as the event progressed.

Piastri went on the chase of the other McLaren during the final phase, providing a thrilling conclusion to the Grand Prix – but Norris held off his team mate to win by just 0.698s.

The impact on the championship? Norris is now only nine points away from Piastri – and, with a further 10 rounds to go when the season resumes, it looks like there is plenty more action to come in the fight for the title.

Iconic F1 camera angles

2025 season: The story so far

It has been almost a year since Daniel Ricciardo lost his Formula 1 race seat and embarked on a new adventure outside the sport.

Daniel Ricciardo has explained how he is going through “a bit of self-exploration” after leaving the world of Formula 1, with the Australian “trying to figure out who I am” beyond racing.

Ricciardo dropped off the F1 grid following the 2024 Singapore Grand Prix, leaving him with a career total of 257 starts, three pole positions, eight victories, 32 podium finishes and more than 1,300 points.

Since then, Ricciardo has kept a relatively low profile, only occasionally making appearances at rounds of his own karting series and sharing few reflections on an F1 stint that featured time at HRT, Toro Rosso (later AlphaTauri/RB), Red Bull, Renault and McLaren.

Speaking in a rare post-F1 interview at Ray White's Connect conference in his native Australia, Ricciardo shared more on what he has been doing since walking away from the sport just under a year ago – and some of the realisations that have followed.

“Well, I haven't been shaving my face,” Ricciardo, who recently turned 36, initially joked. “The beard is my comfort right now.”

On a more serious note, he continued: “This year has been a bit of self-exploration. I lived this crazy high-speed life for so long and this year I've sat into a little bit of stillness.

“I've had a lot of time. I've done some hiking. I was in Alaska a few weeks ago and didn't get mauled by a grizzly [bear], which was a bonus.

“I've been trying to figure out who I am other than this race car driver. I've come to appreciate the little thing[s] more and the meaning of the importance of family and friends.

“I've always been driven and that sometimes leads you to being selfish, so I'm trying to learn to be a bit more selfless and become a better listener.”

With that extra time to reflect, Ricciardo took it all the way back to his very first steps in motorsport – and admitted that he still finds it difficult to believe some of the successes he went on to experience.

“[My] childhood was great,” the Perth-born racer said. “I was always driven to do something that scared me a bit.

“The reason I got into racing was because no one was really doing it. It was my chance to do something a little bit cooler than everyone else.

“I was just showing off, but showing off has got me to a really good place in life.”

He added: “Sometimes I think about things like winning Monaco and think, ‘Did that actually happen?!'.

“I always loved racing, but I never thought I'd have the career I had and make it to F1.

“You just have to take everything one step at a time. If you look too far ahead, everything looks a bit daunting.”

	Daryl Hall and John Oates have privately resolved the legal dispute involving the very public breakdown in their business partnership, court filings confirm.


	“The claims have been adjudicated in arbitration. Given the entry of final judgment in arbitration, plaintiffs will be contemporaneously filing a notice of voluntary dismissal with the court,” lawyers for Hall wrote in a status report filed Monday in Nashville court and obtained by Rolling Stone. The filing did not say when the arbitration outcome was finalized or reveal any details. 


	The status update was the first filing by either party since one of the most successful pop duos of all time burst into the headlines in 2023 with their acrimonious split. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame artists known for their massive Eighties hits “Maneater,” “Private Eyes,” “Kiss on My List,” and “I Can't Go for That (No Can Do),” were no longer on speaking terms as they fought over Oates' right to sell his half of their business partnerhip to Primary Wave, court filings revealed.

	











	In a November 2023 declaration to the court, Hall accused Oates of committing the “ultimate partnership betrayal.” He claimed Oates went behind his back, negotiated with Primary Wave in secret, and then “ambushed” him with news he intended to sell his half of their Whole Oats Enterprises partnership, known as WOE, to the music publishing company as Hall was preparing to leave on a tour. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In his declaration, Hall said he didn't “agree” with Primary Wave's business model and believed such a sale could cause “unimaginable” harm to WOE's assets, which include the music duo's trademarks, personal name and likeness rights, record royalty income, and social media and website properties.

	











	“Over the course of the last several years, there has been a significant shift in John Oates' behavior away from operating in a professional and business-minded manner, particularly as it relates to WOE. His behavior has become adversarial and aggressive instead of professional and courteous,” Hall wrote. “It appears to me that John Oates' intent has become to burden and harass me without regard to my interests as his business partner, or the interests of WOE.”

	Lawyers for Hall and Oates did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.


	In the 2023 filings previously obtained by Rolling Stone, Hall claimed that he was “deeply troubled” that Oates entered into an agreement with Primary Wave in what he called a breach of their partnership agreement. He claimed Oates was required to get his written approval. “I was blindsided,” Hall wrote. “I have no intention of becoming partners with Primary Wave, and the Oates Trust cannot be permitted to thrust a new partner upon me in this outrageous fashion.”


	In a dueling declaration filed at the same time, Oates said he was “tremendously disappointed” that Hall chose to make such “inflammatory, outlandish, and inaccurate statements about me.” He said their dispute was already part of a private mediation and private arbitration, and Hall was the one causing harm.


	“I have no idea who or what is motivating Daryl to take these steps and make such salacious statements, but I am deeply hurt,” Oates wrote. He said over the last 50 years, he has devoted himself to ensuring that fans and the music industry “perceive the Hall & Oates music and brand in the most positive light.”


	The judge paused the sale of Oates' stake pending the completion of the arbitration process. The status report was filed on Monday after the court asked for an update.

	Oates declined to discuss details of the legal battle when he spoke with Rolling Stone last year about his new solo LP Reunion. But he said his focus shifted in recent years, and that involved a move away from Hall & Oates.


	“I'll tell you what changed,” he says. “During the pandemic, there were no more private planes. There were no more arena shows or even acoustic shows. It gave me a chance to step back. I had a chance to reevaluate things. My wife and I decided it was time to give back. We started the Oates Song Fest for Feeding America, and we fed 350,000 families with that. And then I was asked to do Movember, which was a men's health movement. I just got out of the mode of getting back on stage with the big band and the big production.”

	











	Asked if there was an official end date that should be added to the Hall & Oates Wikipedia page, he declined to speak for Hall. “But, yes. As far as I'm concerned, I've moved on. I feel like I have a new lease on my creative life,” he says.

	“A good friend of mine said something to me when this was all starting. He said, ‘John, you were a musician before you met Daryl, and you're still a musician. You're an individual.' And Daryl and I have always called ourselves Daryl Hall and John Oates, because we always wanted to be perceived as two individuals who work together. That was very important to us. If you look at the albums, you'll see that on every album. And so this is the ultimate expression of that.”


	When The Times of London asked Hall earlier this year if the ship had “sailed” on the two men mending their differences, he replied, “That ship has gone to the bottom of the ocean.”

Once again, June Squibb is proving that there's no age limit on being a leading lady. The nonagenarian stars in Scarlett Johansson's feature length directorial debut, Eleanor The Great, as a “witty and proudly troublesome 94-year-old” forced to move from Florida to Manhattan after the death of her best friend, Bessie (Rita Zohar). After a series of misunderstandings, Eleanor ends up telling “a tale that takes on a dangerous life of its own,” per the film's logline. But while Eleanor may be bending the truth, her story ends up leading her into a brand new friendship, this time with a young journalism student named Nina (Erin Kellyman) who's dealing with a loss of her own. As Nina delves deeper into Eleanor's (phony) tale of her life as a Holocaust survivor, she also finds a way to re-connect with her grieving, news anchor father (Chiwetel Ejiofor).



The film looks guaranteed to be a tearjerker; even the trailer might make you a little misty. While Johansson says she's “very proud of it and proud of all the work everybody did to make it,” production was also an emotionally challenging process in a different sense. “Every day the movie fell apart in 400 different ways,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. “It would be easier to make something that was the sequel of a $180 million movie or a genre movie that was subpar. To get much, much, much less money for an independent film with an original story that has a lead actor who was 94 was very, very, very challenging.”

Luckily, Johansson found her way to Sony Pictures Classics, which she said “saved the day” by “still making original ideas and putting faith in first time directors.” The film went on to premiere at Cannes and will also screen at TIFF this fall. Everyone else will get to experience Squibb's latest turn in theaters September 26.

“I'm nostalgic for conversations I had yesterday.” 

That line, delivered by a fast-talking and cynical recent college grad (played by Chris Eigeman, who mastered such roles in the '90s) is one of many memorable bits of dialogue in Kicking And Screaming, writer-director Noah Baumbach's first film. (“Is that a pajama top?” is another—it's no wonder its Criterion edition's cover art consists of a bunch of them handdrawn.) But that line also hits on a theme that would end up running throughout Baumbach's now 30-year career: Time is running out. You maybe (probably) missed your chance. The best days have passed. 

It's a sentiment explored throughout the filmmaker's work. Greenberg centers on another cynical guy (Ben Stiller), who passed up on a record deal 15 years back and finds that his life hasn't amounted to much of anything while his peers have moved on. While We're Young is about a stuck documentary filmmaker (Stiller again) who becomes enamored with a Bushwick couple a generation beneath him. In Frances Ha, co-writer Greta Gerwig's aspiring dancer is faced with the harsh and relatable late-twentysomething reality that maybe the dream that brought you to the big city might not come to pass. But, above all, it's certainly the sentiment underlying Baumbach's best film: 2005's The Squid And The Whale. 

“Nostalgic” might be a weird word to describe a semi-autobiographical movie about your parents getting divorced. Baumbach's father and mother, like the ones in this movie, were both writers who split up, and the director grew up in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where Squid was largely filmed. But it is nostalgic, with cinematographer (and frequent collaborator of Wes Anderson,who produced the film) Robert Yeoman giving the neighborhood—parts of which, to be fair, can be awfully photogenic in real life—a warm, retro glow, its leafy streetscapes being the kind you'd love to walk down on a sunny spring day to the sounds of a Bert Jansch song and its central family's brownstone living room lined with books and cloaked in soft, amber lighting. It's a movie that looks back simultaneously fondly and painfully.



The Squid And The Whale was shot on 16-millimeter film to capture those sensations and 1986 Brooklyn (much like how Todd Haynes' Carol would recreate 1950s New York City a decade later). “I wanted to give the film an authentic 1980s feel. I didn't want to use technology that didn't exist at the time,” Baumbach told IndieWire. “Super 16 also feels lived-in, instantly looks like an older film. I wanted to handhold the movie, but steadily, so you detect only a hint of movement. It added to the immediacy of the whole thing.”

It did: The Squid And The Whale is lean and mean—its runtime is a tight, glorious 81 minutes, and emotional scenes that could have played out longer cut quickly to the next ones so as not to lose momentum. It's also very intimate, both in its storytelling scope and its aesthetic, with a filmmaking style that had a “raw feel,” as Baumbach put it to The A.V. Club‘s Noel Murray, that was inspired by “French New Wave movies, and John Cassavetes and early Martin Scorsese.” And the film's verisimilitude—the quick shots of a bodega counter or a subway stop in Flatbush, say, or the very Park Slope-y bathroom radiator and tiling, or the constant search for a parking spot—heightens the sense of place and help you immediately understand it, even if you've never set foot in Brooklyn. “The brownstone we used belonged to my childhood friend Ben and his wife Molly,” Baumbach told IndieWire. “They were really generous to let us transform their place and relocate while we filmed. Shooting in places that had real meaning to me helped me connect with the material on both a visceral and creative level. I also used my parents' real books. And I put Jeff [Daniels] in my dad's clothes.” 

Daniels, who is fantastic in The Squid And The Whale, plays Bernard Berkman, a snobby and formerly notable author (though he's loathe to admit the “formerly” part) who is very much in the mold of Baumbach's go-to fascinations: past-their-prime or self-described, underappreciated-genius characters. Bernard and his wife, Joan —played by Laura Linney, who gives arguably the best performance in the film, flitting between a sweet motherly voice to calling her kid “a shit” to breaking into laughter because her character, whose writing career is on the upswing while Bernard's is stalled, is too exhausted to argue—have decided to separate. 

Their two children, 16-year-old Walt and 12-year-old Frank (Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline, respectively, with the former tackling, presumably, a young Baumbach surrogate), handle the news differently. Walt immediately takes his father's side and villainizes his mother, while the more emotionally open Frank tells all of his friends about the split right away and resorts to drinking alcohol alone and masturbating in school, spreading his cum on lockers and library books. This is very much the kids' film: Early on, the parental strife is seen from their perspective—at a distance, with Walt crouching near the banister to hear the muffled shouting of his parents below.

If some of the Frank stuff sounds particularly left-field or even envelope-pushing for a comedic drama that is, ultimately, an empathetic portrait of a divorce and the people it hurts, it is—and it's not the only instance. These parents talk remarkably candidly, too candidly, about sex with their children, and Bernard in particular gives some very questionable advice. He and Walt even get into an odd sort of love triangle with one of Bernard's writing students, the lively, 20-year-old Lili (a great Anna Paquin) that calls to mind the one at the center of Squid producer Wes Anderson's Rushmore. Before Lili moves in with them—and sleeps with her professor and flirts with his son—Bernard describes her work like this: “She's a very risky writer, Lili. Very racy. I mean, exhibiting her cunt in that fashion is very racy. I mean, Lili hails her influences in postmodern literature, a bit derivative of Kafka. For a student, very racy. Did you get that it was her cunt?” (The fact that you end up caring for Bernard in the end is one of Squid‘s greatest achievements.) 

The Squid And The Whale arrived at a weird and (from an outsider's perspective) make-or-break time for Baumbach, whose career had stumbled in the late '90s. A Filmmaker piece from 2007, when the director was promoting his follow-up to Squid, Margot At The Wedding, tidily summed up that stretch: “After his second film, Mr. Jealousy (1997), Baumbach admits that he got “derailed” and ended up making Highball (1997) pseudonymously then scripted a TV movie, Thirty (2000), neither of which he considers to be his best work. However, his career was re-energized by his association with Wes Anderson: He brought Baumbach on board to co-write The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004), and then produced Baumbach's triumphant The Squid And The Whale (2005).” Murray assessed his pre-Zissou period even more bluntly: “Baumbach fell off the radar.” 

It's hard to imagine the Noah Baumbach we know now—the co-scribe of a billion-dollar phenom, who will release a film starring George Clooney, Adam Sandler, and Laura Dern this November as one of the rare writer-directors who can seemingly make whatever he wants these days—without The Squid And The Whale putting him back on that radar. And while it's foolish to opine on conversations and dealings you weren't privy to, it's also tough not to think that his professional collaboration with Anderson helped bring Squid to life. To this day, Squid is the only film that Anderson has produced that he hasn't also directed and co-written.

But beyond the machinations of finally getting a passion project off the ground, Squid is a notable step up from what Baumbach had done before. Watching it feels akin to seeing a band you like come out with a third record that really surprises you, absolutely rules, and crystallizes the bits you appreciated about them in the first place. Kicking And Screaming is a lot of fun, extremely quotable, and has an amusing, understandable premise. Who doesn't just want to stay at college and ignore the real world for another year after graduating? Mr. Jealousy is also enjoyable as a Woody Allenish, talky comedy starring Kicking vet Eric Stoltz and The Sopranos‘ Annabella Sciorra. But The Squid And The Whale, even though it has a lot of the same ingredients—snobbery, film and book references, smart characters, heartache, a lot of chatting about New York—is a revelation in comparison. It's assured, complete, raw, and instantly worthy of attention, as if Baumbach had this kind of movie in the back of his brain and was finally able to extract it. (“I do think that I in some ways trusted my own voice as a filmmaker more on this one,” he said in that A.V. Club interview.)

One of the running jokes of The Squid And The Whale is that Walt pretends that he penned Pink Floyd's “Hey You.” He ends up winning the talent show for his performance (“I'm going to play lead guitar and do vocals on a song…I wrote,” he says), only to have his trophy taken away when it's discovered that it was actually an incredibly popular track by Pink fucking Floyd. Ken Leung's school therapist presses him on why he lied. “I felt I could have written it, so the fact that it was already written was kind of a technicality,” Walt replies, quickly and defensively. In Squid, you get little glimpses of a smart, impressive teen (though not as smart and impressive as he let on) who would make a film, 19 years later as an adult, that'd finally win those trophies, give him the shot of confidence he needed to reenergize his career, and—most importantly—happen to be really goddamn good (or, to mangle a quote from Bernard, “the fillet of the genre”).

The pop star fittingly announced her 12 studio album on Aug. 12.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Taylor Swift didn't rest for long after wrapping her global Eras Tour. After just eight months of downtime, the pop superstar all but broke the internet by revealing at 12:12 a.m. ET Tuesday (Aug. 12) that she'd be embarking on a brand new era with the release of an album titled The Life of a Showgirl, which will mark the 12th studio LP in her discography.


	What was almost as eye-popping as the announcement itself was the way she shared the news. In lieu of her more recent method of unveiling new albums during award-show acceptance speeches — like she did for 2022's Midnights at the VMAs and 2024's The Tortured Poets Department at the Grammys — Swift instead chose a much more casual route of spreading the word this time. Joining boyfriend Travis Kelce on his New Heights podcast, the 14-time Grammy winner simply revealed the project's existence and title in a clip posted to the show's social media accounts, just one day before the full episode's release.


	“So, I wanted to show you something,” she said in the video, pulling a blurred-out vinyl from a “T.S.” brief case as the Kansas City Chiefs tight end beamed beside her. “This is my brand new album, The Life of a Showgirl.”


	Fans are now clamoring for all the information they can get on the LP, which will mark Swift's first full-length since 17-week Billboard 200 chart-topper Tortured Poets. But while only time will tell how the famously cryptic, Easter-egg-dropping musician will continue sharing new details about Life of a Showgirl, Billboard is keeping track of all of them as they come.


	See everything there is to know — so far — about Swift's 12th studio album below.


	The title of The Life of a Showgirl was the first detail Swift revealed about the project, doing so in the New Heights clip, which was posted after a timer on her website ticked down to 12:12 a.m. ET on Aug. 12. But fans are already starting to come up with theories about what inspired the theatrical name, with some people pointing out that scenes from Gold Diggers of 1933 — a 92-year-old film about showgirls — just so happen to match the aesthetic of her Eras Tour performance of “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived.”


	Swifties have also picked up on the fact that the musician likely wrote most or all of The Life of a Showgirl while putting on her own traveling show for two years straight on the Eras trek. “Okay wait I'm already obsessed with this album concept,” one fan wrote on X. “The Life of a Showgirl potentially being about Taylor's life during the eras tour, the highest of highs and the lowest of lows, the physical and mental toll, the glitz and the glam, the celebrations, the constant travel, the longing and long distance… I am OBSESSED.”


	For months, Swifties speculated that her incorporation of more and more orange outfits in the final stages of the Eras Tour meant that the star's next album would have an orange theme — something that proved to be true when Swift finally announced The Life of a Showgirl, changing her website to have a sparkly clementine wallpaper, and updating her profile pictures on social media to show a similarly hued lock. Taylor Nation had also shared 12 images of Swift wearing orange on stage hours before the album was announced.


	A second crucial color of the new era, however, appears to be mint green — and fans think they might have already figured out what it represents. “The colour scheme is copper oxidizing because a showgirl is on a pedestal for the world and over time, in the public eye they lose their shine…,” one person wrote on X, using the Statue of Liberty's fade from bronze to green over time as an example.


	After working almost exclusively with Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner for about eight years, Swift appears to have reunited with producer Max Martin for The Life of a Showgirl. At least, that's what fans have gathered from the mysterious Spotify playlist Swift personally curated for the new era — titled “And baby, that's show business for you” — that includes only songs she made with the elusive Swedish pop pioneer.


	The premise of Martin's involvement is definitely exciting, as he helped Swift craft some of her biggest hits to date. Their previous collaborations include “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” “Blank Space” and “Shake It Off,” each of which spent multiple weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.

The Prime Video sci-fi comedy from creator Greg Daniels will debut its final season on Aug. 25.


							By 

	Abbey White


Associate Editor & News Writer


Upload's return promises dark AI, chinchilla life coaches and a love story for the (digital) ages in the new trailer for the Prime Video series' final season. 


	The sci-fi comedy's four-part finale event was previously teased during San Diego Comic-Con with a look at Aleesha's (Zainab Johnson) new life as a spy tasked with infiltrating Horizon, the company in charge of running Lakeview. Now, as part of a new two-minute teaser (below), the Prime Video series picks up where season three left off, revealing the fate of Robbie Amell's two Nathans inside that digital afterlife.

	As a ragged-looking Nora (Andy Allo) discovers her version of Nathan has seemingly succumbed to deletion and somehow returned as a digital ghost, she sets out to not only convince the others that he's alive, but to save and reunite with him. 


	Meanwhile, Ingrid (Allegra Edwards) and her Nathan navigate the unique challenges of a virtual relationship, alongside Nathan and Luke (Kevin Bigley) affirming their friendship as the rest of Lakeview faces new threats. That includes ownership focused on increasing monetization, a tall, dark and threatening AI Guy (Owen Daniels), and the potential full-blown destruction of Lakeview with everyone inside. 


	The four-part finale event promises one final battle as a new sentient evil AI threatens to wipe out the world, testing the series' core ensemble — Nathan, Nora, Ingrid, Aleesha, Luke and AI Guy — like never before. 


	Created by Greg Daniels, who also serves as executive producer along with Howard Klein and Maxwell Vivian, Upload's fourth and final season will premiere on Aug. 25.

	Swifties are done seeing the world of The Tortured Poets Department in black and white. Now, The Life of a Showgirl, the forthcoming 12th studio album from Taylor Swift, has drenched their reality in screaming color — shades of orange and teal, to be exact. The record marks the fifth album from the singer-songwriter in five years — not counting her re-recording series — but her fans never tire of the thrill of vindication. The hints and easter eggs that could have passed for symptoms of psychosis before might have been real all along. New era, same classic antics.

Goodnight showgirls I'll see you for more psychosis tomorrow pic.twitter.com/7R2bXy3sOL


	“It's so fun to be a fan of the zodiac killer in pop star form,” a Swiftie named Lacey wrote on X a few hours before the official announcement of the new album arrived at 12:12 a.m. EST on Tuesday. “The excitement I feel when the cryptic hints start to take form. Nobody does it like Taylor!” 


	The high of the album announcement has some fans feeling like they could lift a car with one hand, or single-handedly speed up the passage of time. They don't even know how long they have to go before Swift releases the album, or even unveils the first single. “A Taylor Swift announcement followed by a 48-hour wait for the cover & release date should actually be considered psychological warfare,” Swiftie Josefina said on X.

	











	Combing through the past few years of Swift's content, fans have noticed nods to the Showgirl era stretching all the way back to 2022, when she released Midnights. “With ‘The Life of a Show Girl,' I'm revisiting the narrative of ‘Bejeweled.' Remember that Tay is a show girl for the whole video, it's the way she can win. Everything in the elevator and the tower she climbs is in the art deco style, the roaring 20s and the showgirls of the era,” another X user, Gaby, shared. Others have pointed out that in the elevator scene from “Bejeweled,” the buttons to the 2nd and 10th floors are orange, another nod to the number 12.

the album title gives me such bejeweled energy idk why ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥#THELIFEOFASHOWGIRL pic.twitter.com/Wsc5f6FQw7


	More hints were apparently hidden in the Eras Tour. In the “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” video, captured during the tour, fans realized that Swift rehearsed with orange burlesque feather fans. Some Swifties are taking it a bit further. “SWIFTIES I JUST REALIZED ANOTHER INSANE EASTER EGG,” one account, JB, announced on X. “‘Applause' by Lady Gaga – which played in the pre show of every night of the Eras Tour – was released on AUGUST 12TH.” (The song also turns 12 years old today, but surely that could just be a twisted coincidence).


	Swifties are digging into color theory (likely thing for them to do), too. “Super into whoever brought up the oxidation of copper with the color scheme,” a fan named Joy wrote. “The inevitable degradation and unwanted changes in appearance that come with a woman aging in the limelight….” The original post, already viral, was from a fan named Kaitlyn. “The colour scheme is copper oxidizing because a showgirl is on a pedestal for the world and over time,” she said. “In the public eye they lose their shine… the weathering from being the target for the world's misogyny.”


	Fans have pointed out parallels to fictional characters that were showgirls in their own universe — like Lucy Gray Baird in Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, or Carrie Bradshaw when she finds out that Big is moving to Paris.

	Swift hasn't directly addressed fans quite yet. She will appear on boyfriend Travis Kelce's podcast New Heights on Wednesday, and revealed the album title in the teaser for the episode. But overnight, Spotify billboards appeared with a code to access a playlist titled “And baby, that's show business for you” full of Swift songs. Coincidentally, all of the songs included were produced by Max Martin. “Does Spotify even have the infrastructure to handle a Taylor Swift Max Martin and Shellbeck release,” one Swiftie asked. Another added: “Thinking about the fact that there's swifties who don't even know who Max Martin and Shellback are…. ancient texts REVIVED.”

	This has also led many fans to believe Swift's most consistent collaborator, Jack Antonoff, was not involved with the project. “Jack Antonoff I love you and your synthesizer dearly and will defend you until the day I die but Max Martin and Shellback I am welcoming you back with arms wide open,” Swiftie Holly wrote about Swift's other 1989 and Reputation collaborators. Another added: “Aaron Dessner, we might not meet you at midnight for the album release but I do believe we will meet you at 1 am for some bonus tracks.”

	










maybe the life of a showgirl is the reputation tv we made along the way…. https://t.co/Mz10S8irxR


	With The Life of a Showgirl on the way, Swifties are ready for their closeup — kind of. “Being the office swiftie is so humiliating, like I have to go to bed knowing I'm in for a whole press junket tomorrow,” one user wrote. It's showtime.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Stavros Halkias, a buzzy comedian recently making his way into acting with projects like Yorgos Lanthimos' Bugonia and indie comedy Let's Start a Cult, has come aboard for a role in Tony, the forthcoming Anthony Bourdain biopic from A24, Star Thrower and Zapruder Films, which has wrapped production.


	Character details are under wraps. As previously announced, The Holdovers breakout Dominic Sessa leads the cast, which also includes Antonio Banderas, Emilia Jones, and Leo Woodall.


	While pic's logline is under wraps, sources say the film takes place during the summer of 1976, when a young Anthony Bourdain has a life-changing summer in Provincetown.

	











BlackBerry helmer Matt Johnson is directing from a script by Todd Bartels and Lou Howe. A24 is producing with Tim and Trevor White under their Star Thrower (The Post, King Richard) banner, along with Johnson and Matthew Miller through their Zapruder Films. Exec producers include Chris Stinson, Amy Greene, Lou Howe, Todd Bartels and Emily Rose, as well as Kimberly Witherspoon, who reps Bourdain's estate.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Viewed by comedy insiders as one of the comics you'll see break out as a star in film and TV, Halkias has in recent years been courted by a number of top-tier filmmakers, including Lanthimos (with Bugonia, premiering in Venice later this month) and Steven Soderbergh (with the recent sci-fi web series Command Z). He built his following with specials like the self-released Live at the Lodge Room, which reached a million views on YouTube in its first four days and currently sits at over 7M, and Netflix's Fat Rascal, as well as podcasts like the hugely popular Cum Town, which ran from 2016-2022. Most recently, he wrote, produced and starred in indie comedy Let's Start a Cult, also starring opposite Shane Gillis in Season 2 of Netflix's Tires.


	Currently on the international leg of his The Dreamboat Tour, Halkias at the same time hosts the podcast Stavvy's World, which debuted at #3 on the iTunes comedy charts and garnered hundreds of thousands of subscribers in its first year. He is represented by UTA.

Kelce told GQ he loves watching girlfriend Swift perform because she can make a stadium feel like "this little room." 


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Travis Kelce knows all about sacrificing, training and running your body ragged in order to play like a champ on game day. The 12-year veteran tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs with three Super Bowl rings on his resumé talked to GQ for a new cover story about the laser-focused offseason training regimen aimed at getting the team back to the big game after a tough blow-out loss earlier this year to rivals the Philadelphia Eagles.


	Not for nothing, he also said that as hard as he hits the gym, his girlfriend of two years, Taylor Swift, is just a much of a gym rat when it comes to prep for her shows. 

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“I hadn't experienced somebody in the same shoes as me, having a partner who understands the scrutiny, understands the ups and downs of being in front of millions,” Kelce said in the story that delves into the couple's closely held relationship, which has played out on phone screens on any given Sunday over the past two years as Swift has cheered Kelce on and he returned the favor by attending her epic, three-plus hour Eras Tour gigs around the world.




	“That was very relatable, seeing how exhausted she would get after shows,” he said. “She may not think of herself as an athlete. She will never tell anyone that she is an athlete. But I've seen what she goes through. I've seen the amount of work that she puts on her body, and it's mind-blowing.”


	Swift famously trained for the show by performing the entire career-spanning set while running on a treadmill, something Kelce said was super intense, even for a dedicated athlete like him. He described the stage for the show as “football-field-sized computer,” one that got “scorching hot” on stops in places like Singapore. “All of a sudden you're feeling the fumes from the computer and you're feeling the fumes from the sun and you're doing a show for three hours with a lot of energy, bringing it every single song,” he said of Swift's never-say-quit perseverance. “That is arguably more exhausting than how much I put in on a Sunday, and she's doing it three, four, five days in a row.”


	And while he is a global superstar in his own right now — guest hosting SNL in 2023, appearing in the new Happy Gilmore 2 sequel, hosting his New Heights podcast with brother Jason Kelce and the Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity? series — when it comes to his life in SwiftLand, he's happy to just be a “plus one.”


	Kelce said he is excited to go to Swift's shows and be a fan, because he is a fan. “I'm a fan of music. I'm a fan of art. And it's so cool that I get to experience her being that plus one for me on the football field…. I feel that same enjoyment every time she comes to my shows,” he said of Swift's by-now routine appearances in the family sky box cheering him on during the season. And while he's been introduced to arguably the biggest pop fandom in the world as half of one of the most-watched couples on the planet, Kelce isn't afraid to take credit for making Swift a fan of his world in the process.

	











	“I sort of made her a football fan,” Kelce told the magazine, which described him as speaking freely about his partner with the “confident adoration of a sturdy relationship,” while noting that his pride is not of the macho or overprotective chivalrous type, but more of the “immaculate,” selfless variety. “She is the most engulfed fan now. She knows what the injury reports look like. She understands what special situations are, third and short—all these things because she just naturally loves to hear about my job.”


	He also can't get enough of her shows, marveling at the impact Swift has on her followers and the warm pull of her celebrity, a rare gift that can make a 65,000-capacity football stadium feel like a living room. “People gravitate towards how she performs and how she makes it feel like the entire stadium is in this little room with her,” he said. “She is so good at mesmerizing everybody and making everybody feel like it's an intimate situation. I think that alone — there is so much calm and coolness. She's beautiful. She's up there making everyone feel at ease.”


	As he gears up for the upcoming 2025-2026 football season, Kelce will have plenty more chances to see Swift in the stands, and, maybe, on stage again. The singer surprise announced her 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl, on Tuesday morning (Aug. 12) and while no specifics on the LP have been announced yet, it's possible Swift will reveal some details on Wednesday (Aug. 13) when she makes her first appearance on the New Heights pod.

She survived a horrific auto accident during the sitcom's second season and went on to become a veterinarian.

	Danielle Spencer, who played the precocious youngster Dee Thomas on the 1970s ABC sitcom What's Happening!!, has died. She was 60. 


	Spencer died Monday in a hospital in Richmond, Virginia, her What's Happening!! co-star Haywood Nelson told The Hollywood Reporter.




	She was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy in 2014 and in 2018 underwent emergency surgery to relieve bleeding on her brain. A GoFundMe page was set up to help her pay for her medical expenses.

	“She suffered for a very long time but did it with a great deal of courage,” Nelson said.

	











	Co-produced by All in the Family‘s Bud Yorkin, What's Happening!! was loosely based on the 1975 film Cooley High (Eric Monte wrote the movie screenplay and created the Watts-based sitcom). After a successful four-week run that started in August 1976, the comedy returned in November of that year and then for another two seasons.


	Spencer played Dee, the smart-aleck younger sister of Roger “Raj” Thomas (Ernest Thomas) and daughter of Mabel (Mabel King), and she became known for her catch phrase, “Ooooh, I'm gonna tell Mama!” Nelson portrayed the down-to-earth Dwayne on the show.


	She reprised the role for the sequel What's Happening Now!, which aired for another three seasons starting in 1985.


	Spencer went on to became a veterinarian in 1993, and James L. Brooks hired her to play one in his 1997 film, As Good as It Gets. “She had a great love of animals, she was like Betty White in that way,” Nelson said.


	Born on June 24, 1965, and raised in New York City by her mother, Cheryl, a French teacher, and stepfather, actor Tim Pelt, Danielle Luise Spencer started acting at age 7 in a repertory company co-founded by Pelt.

	











	She had uncredited bit parts in such films as Serpico (1973) and Harry and Tonto (1974) before landing the role in What's Happening!! when she was 11, bringing her and her family to California.


	“I had never seen any young black girl in that type of spotlight, so I didn't have a reference point in the media as to how to deal with this opportunity,” she told Jet magazine in 2014. “I was from the Bronx. What I did was use my own family as the reference on how to portray my character.”


	In September 1977, Spencer was involved in a five-car accident on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu that killed her stepfather, who was driving, and left her in intensive care for several weeks. He had taken her to see Star Wars at the drive-in the previous evening.


	“I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye to my stepfather, Daddy Tim, whom I loved and who taught me show business as a young child in New York,” Spencer wrote in her 2010 memoir, Through the Fire … Journal of a Child Star.


	After What's Happening!! was canceled, Spencer and her family moved to the Ivory Coast. She then attended UC Davis, UCLA and then veterinary school at Tuskegee University, earning a doctorate in veterinary medicine in 1993.


	A decade later, Spencer developed a spinal condition — perhaps caused by her auto accident — that left her paralyzed from the waist down for months.


	Spencer worked as a veterinarian for two decades in the Los Angeles area before relocating in 2014 to Richmond, where she did a regular morning segment about pet care for CBS affiliate WTVR-TV.

	











	In 2014, she was inducted into the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture.


	In addition to her mother, survivors include her brother, Jeremy, a jazz musician.


	In a 2016 interview with Hers magazine, Spencer said it was important to do “what it is that you think is going to make you happy.”


	“You really have to live life for you at that minute,” she said. “And just try to have fun. Be lighthearted and be happy while you're here, because you never know when that time is going to end.”

	Even before Donald Trump officially began his second term in office, his family businesses were beginning the race to milk the presidency for every cent they could. Now, a new analysis from The New Yorker has put a potential dollar figure on how much Trump's crypto ventures, real estate deals, licensing agreements, and other grifts have netted America's first family over the course of Trump's time in politics: a staggering $3.4 billion.


	The total is an estimate, as the Trump Organization and its various auxiliary companies and ventures — which are largely under the control of the president's adult children — have not been entirely transparent regarding their finances.


The New Yorker estimated that the president's various cryptocurrency had generated at least $2.37 billion in value, financial investments coordinated by Donald Jr. and Eric Trump have generated $339.6 million, and Trump's flagship Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, has raked in $125 million in extra profits.

	











	Tack onto that $127.7 million in legal fee collection and merchandise sales and a media empire estimated to be worth $116 million, and it becomes clear that the Trumps have built themselves a corporate empire on the back of their patriarch's public office. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Just last month, the president took a detour from a state trip to Scotland, for which millions of taxpayer dollars were spent on travel and security, to inaugurate a new Trump golf course near Aberdeen, Scotland. On that same trip, Trump hosted British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at his private Turnberry golf club — which (as was the practice during Trump's first term) will likely profit off of the president's choice to use it as a venue. The same week, it was reported that Trump has privately discussed hosting the G20 summit of world leaders at his Doral golf club.

	











	As previously reported by Rolling Stone, the president has complained to his inner circle that it was “stupid” of him to leave so much money on the table during his first term, and that he planned to rectify his mistake the second time around.

	The fact that the family's business deals making headlines around the world are being coordinated by Trump's children is a convenient loophole that allows the president to escape many of the disclosure and ethics laws that govern private investments by public officials.


	After years accusing his political opponents — and their sons — of leveraging the status of the White House to enrich themselves, the Trumps are engaged in an open campaign of open grift unlike any in the history of the Oval Office, and Americans are now just beginning to get a full picture of just how rich the People's House is making the president.

“Mare of Easttown” creator Brad Ingelsby is back exploring another distinctive slice of Americana with “Task,” an HBO original drama series debuting Sunday September 7 and releasing its seven-episode season weekly after that. Take a look at the newly released trailer for “Task” below.

Ingelsby became one of TV's most celebrated new creators with his 2021 limited series “Mare of Easttown,” starring Kate Winslet — IndieWire even listed “Mare of Easttown” as one of the greatest HBO series ever. A portrait of a near-suburban eastern Pennsylvania police chief, it gripped viewers with its twisty but empathetic procedural story as Winslet's cop unravels a murder mystery. It felt like one of the few cops-and-criminals crime thrillers that actually cared about its victims.

It's taken four years, but Ingelsby returns with a new series, and “Task” looks to explore other often-neglected aspects of American life. This time, Mark Ruffalo leads an FBI Task Force assigned to solving a string of armed robberies, led by a family man (Tom Pelphrey) who hardly fits the profile of career criminal.

 










Ingelsby's always been interested in life at the margins. His debut spec script, which became the 2013 film “Out of the Furnace,” came to him when he imagined what it would be like to be a criminal recently let out of prison — at the time he was writing it, the then AFI grad student was working a summer job at the famed Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio.

His work is that of deeply felt character studies, from the Sienna Miller-starring “American Woman” to the addiction recovery drama “The Way Back.” Ingelsby's most recent film is the Julianne Moore-Sydney Sweeney starring thriller “Echo Valley.”

Billed right now as a drama series, it'll be interesting to see if “Task” has multi-season potential for HBO. “Mare of Easttown” won multiple Emmys in the limited series categories for the 2020-2021 season, though it lost Best Limited Series to “The Queen's Gambit.” IndieWire is certainly excited about this one. We put “Task” on our list of our most anticipated HBO shows of 2025. Watch the trailer below.

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


	The blast radius of Carl Rinsch‘s extravagant spending habits and Netflix‘s impetuous handing out of millions in the Golden Age of Streaming now has the feds footing the bills.


	A month before the 47 Ronin director's fraud and money laundering trial over allegedly scamming the Ted Sarandos– and Greg Peters-run streamer out of $11 million and more was initially scheduled to start in New York City, looks like the once high-living Rinsch truly is dead broke – as he claimed when he was arrested in March in Los Angeles.


	In fact, out on a $100,000 bond posted quickly after the Department of Justice indictment came down, the “no income” filmmaker behind the never completed and hugely over-budget android drama series White Horse/Conquest is totally skint. The 47-year-old Rinsch is so broke, say his public defender lawyers, that he can't afford to get himself from L.A. to the Big Apple for a pre-trial court appearance next week.

	











	And a federal judge is A-Okay with that. 


	“Ordered that the United States Marshals Service arrange for Mr. Rinsch's means of noncustodial transportation from Los Angeles, California to New York, New York, or furnish the fare for such transportation for Mr. Rinsch's court appearance, scheduled for August 19, 2025 at 4 PM,” wrote District Judge Jed Rakoff on Monday after receiving a request from the director's publicly provided attorney. “It is hereby ordered that it should be arranged for Mr. Rinsch to arrive in New York by the evening of August, 18, 2025; and it is hereby further ordered that the aforesaid expenses shall be paid for by the United States Marshals Service.”

	











	Facing decades behind bars if found guilty on multiple charges, Rinsch was originally set to go on trial September 8. That date has now been kicked down the calendar to December 2 at 9:30 a.m. ET in the federal courthouse at 500 Pearl Street. No witness list has been produced yet, but you can be sure ex-Netflix exec Cindy Holland, and maybe even Sarandos and 47 Ronin star Keanu Reeves, are in the running to potentially testify.


	Given the seal of approval by Reeves, Rinsch was given $61 million by now-Paramount streaming chief Holland when she deftly snagged White Horse, later renamed Conquest, out of Amazon's paws in 2018. Burning through $44 million for the project with little to show for it but holding final-cut power, Rinsch insisted in 2020 he needed another $11 million for various and pre- and post-production needs to complete the series. Netflix gave it to him.


	Well, as Billy Preston once said, “nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin',” and despite telling Netflix that everything was “awesome and moving forward really well” on the project, Rinsch is accused of going on a spending spree of cars, crypto, lawyers (to sue Netflix), fancy watches, fun and more.


	A year or so later, with Rinsch living large but almost busted again, the streamer took Rinsch to arbitration to get its money back.


	Securing a $12 million award, Netflix won that round, after the filmmaker claimed the company actually owed him $14 million. However, a poverty-declaring Rinsch hasn't paid them a penny, and the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York (which hasn't had the best year between Donald Trump's vengeance and face-planting in its sex-trafficking prosecution of Sean “Diddy” Combs) came a knockin' a few months ago – -which brings us to now.


	Assuming that Rinsch, who has pleaded not guilty, isn't flying Con Air or Amtracking or Greyhounding it, air travel is actually pretty reasonable, even with less than a week left to make the trip.


	Currently, with a peek on Expedia, there is a one-way and non-stop 8:47 p.m. PT flight in economy on August 18 from LAX to JFK on Frontier Airlines for $245 before taxes and fees. That flight gets into NYC at 5:30 a.m. ET, so Rinsch would have  time before having to show up at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Courthouse in the afternoon. Alternatively, there is a 9:15 a.m. PT one-way flight on Delta for $459 that would get Rinsch into JFK at around 6:25 p.m. ET on August 18.


	When you make this a return flight with Rinsch going back to Los Angeles on August 20, the prices go up to around $600 at the low end. Of course, this doesn't take into consideration the fact that the defendant will likely need a hotel, which is never cheap or easy to get in New York in the middle of August.


	Still, in this age of deep federal budget cuts and agencies being slashed by the Trump administration, even the idea of a one-time multimillionaire (at least on paper) Hollywood director getting government handouts might just rub some the wrong way.


	Just maybe.

I'm in the minority but I personally like 47 Ronin.  But the thing is…that movie went way over budget, it's release date was moved back multiple times, and Universal finally had to fire CR during post production because they didn't think he would ever finish the movie.  All of this was widely reported….so giving the writer/director a huge sum of money with no supervision sounds like business malpractice.  Shareholders should be suing the Netflix execs who gave him the money and didn't monitor the progress of what he was making rather than Netflix suing him.  Netflix execs are shirking responsibility for their own actions.

None of this adds up. How the hell would any director just be given $64 million dollars for a movie and not have a single producer following along to make sure things were going according to plan? Did they start filming? Was anyone seeing dailies? Were actors hired? Were their dept heads on set? WAS there a set?! Like, was the movie shot but he just ran over budget because he was spending the budget on himself the side?
This article makes it out like Rinsch was given millions, spent it all, and didn't actually shoot the movie at all. This article also fails to mention that taxpayer dollars partly fund the United States Marshal Service's budget. So, WE the People, are partially paying for this grifter's flight and hotel and food to/from NYC.

He directed one studio movie with budget issues, that he was nearly fired from, that failed at the box office…

…and he was given free reign over the budget here? Where was the oversight by Netflix? Who and where were the producers? How did he even access that much money without anyone knowing? I rep directors and can't even figure how this happened. He may be a fraudster but he was enabled by a shocking lack of oversight for someone with his history.

He was Ridley Scott's son in law, and they thought he was the second coming of Ridley.

I've been working in this business for over 30 years and one thing has remained the same:   Buyers watch money like a hawk.   How could this even happen?   Who was asleep at the wheel at Netflix?!??

	“It's easy to talk about forgiveness and mercy when it's not your loss.” So begins a new trailer for Task, HBO‘s upcoming drama series from Mare of Easttown creator Brad Ingelsby. The seven-episode series premieres Sunday, Sept. 7 at 9 pm on HBO and will stream next day on HBO Max.


	Set to Pink Floyd's “Wish You Were Here”, the trailer sees Mark Ruffalo‘s Tom, an FBI agent in action as he's put in charge of a task force to find the perpetrators of a string of violent home invasion robberies led by an unsuspecting family man (Tom Pelphrey). 


	“I'm gonna take their money so we can have a better life,” says Pelphrey's Robbie.  ‘When we're too deep into something, we just can't see what others see,” he adds.

	“We need to find this crew before a turf war escalates,” warns FBI supervisory senior resident Kathleen McGinty (Martha Plimpton).


	Cast also includes Emilia Jones, Jamie McShane, Sam Keeley, Thuso Mbedu, Fabien Frankel, Alison Oliver, Raúl Castillo, Silvia Dionicio and Phoebe Fox. 


	Similar to Mare of Easttown, Task is set in the working class suburbs of Philadelphia and is based on an original idea by Ingelsby who serves as creator/writer/showrunner and executive producer. Jeremiah Zagar and Salli Richardson-Whitfield direct and executive produce. Additionally, Mark Roybal and Paul Lee executive produce for wiip, along with Ruffalo; David Crockett and Ron Schmidt. Nicole Jordan-Webber and Jeremy Yaches serve as co-executive producers for Public Record.

Brandon Blackstock, the former husband of Kelly Clarkson, traded Hollywood for the quiet expanse of Montana in the years before his death at 48. The onetime music manager left Los Angeles behind to live as a rancher and rodeo founder, building a new life on a sprawling $1.8 million property while privately battling cancer.

According to real estate records obtained by the US Sun, Blackstock bought his four-bedroom, three-bath ranch in Butte, Montana, in April 2022 for $1.8 million. The home sits on more than 41 acres and was described by listing agents as “very private and serene.” It features massive ceilings, panoramic mountain views, and open spaces ideal for livestock operations.

From the property, Blackstock ran his companies — V Bar V Cattle Co. and Valley View Livestock — and also founded Valley View Rodeo in Bozeman. The wide-open setting allowed him to step away from the high-pressure entertainment world and immerse himself in ranch work.

In the weeks before his death, his eldest daughter, Savannah, 23, visited the ranch and shared candid family photos online. Blackstock was also father to River, 11, and Remington, 9, with Clarkson, and to Savannah and Seth from his first marriage to Melissa Ashworth. He was a grandfather to Savannah's son and had another grandchild on the way.

A post shared by Shelby Blackstock (@shelbyblackstock)

Before his retreat to Montana, Blackstock had a high-profile career in the music industry. Working alongside his father, Narvel Blackstock, he managed artists including Blake Shelton and produced for “The Kelly Clarkson Show.” He was also the former stepson of country icon Reba McEntire, maintaining a close relationship with her after her 2015 divorce from Narvel.

Clarkson filed for divorce in June 2020, with the split finalized two years later following disputes over property — including her $10 million “Vintage Valley” ranch. After she won the property in court, Blackstock moved to his own Butte ranch.

Blackstock's cancer diagnosis remained private until his death on August 7. His family confirmed the news in a statement to CNN:

“It is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family. We thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family's privacy during this very difficult time.”

TMZ reported he was fighting melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer, and Page Six noted that he was in hospice care before his passing. A source told Page Six, “It's been exhausting and so sad. Kelly has been working so hard, as well as looking after Brandon. Despite their difficult divorce, he's still the man she loved and still her kids' father.”

Just one day before his death, Clarkson canceled her Las Vegas residency dates to be with their children. “While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them,” she told fans.

CEO Max Welch, president Duane Jones, and COO Tim Withers discuss the London- and L.A.-based unscripted producer's 'Making Manson' and other true-crime hits, selling to the likes of Peacock and Fox, and what's next.

	Elvis Presley? Check! Charles Manson? Done! Jeffrey Dahmer? Yes! Dr. Phil? Upcoming. Production company Renowned Films, which is operating between London and Los Angeles, has quietly built a transatlantic unscripted business with shows about big names and an unconventional approach focused on fast development cycles, access-led storytelling with an eye on younger audiences, and direct-to-network or streamer sales, along with full rights retention.


	The themes of hustling, disruption, digital production, and serving ideas with a twist to U.S. buyers to cut through in a competitive industry dominated by legacy studios keep coming up during a meeting with Renowned CEO Max Welch, president Duane Jones, and chief operating officer Tim Withers. They have taken time out of their busy schedule to discuss their business approach and such success stories as Making Manson on NBCUniversal streamer Peacock, Loving Elvis on Prime Video, My Son Jeffrey: The Dahmer Family Tapes on Fox, Deadly Waters With Captain Lee on Peacock, and E! Dirty Rotten Scandals: The Dr. Phil Show, which is set to hit E! in 2026.

	Without a studio deal or traditional packaging, the young trio's goal has been to build an independent empire from the backstreets of London to the heart of Hollywood.

	Jones, a former BBC radio host, tells THR that he “kind of fell into radio, honestly, just out of love for music. But I've always wanted to push the boundaries with content creation. Obviously, content is king, and I've always had my eye on creating content.” He ended up seeing an opportunity for a magazine show bringing together artists who had made a name for themselves with self-produced music videos.

	











	More than a decade later, he met Welch and Withers. “I felt they are really innovative guys, future-facing,  technical guys who are artistic but do not put art over content,” Jones recalls. “Everything they wanted to make had substance. So, our goals and tastes were aligned in terms of what we wanted to do. We are all very different individually, but I think our purpose was to meet and to create Renowned and make content with a voice.”


	Welch has the brain for business strategy, while Withers understands the ins and outs of production and other technology, as well as financials. “And I tag along and bring in my ideas,” Jones says with a laugh.


	Withers and Welch were still at university when the trio started working together. “We did a whole range of different projects together, and then we got kind of sick of uni. I wasn't really for us. We were actually doing real things,” Welch recalls. “We said we haven't done 10 years at the BBC or 20 years at Banijay. Let's just start a production company and see what we can do. Believing that we had access through Dwayne, we were ambitious and stupid and naive, thinking we could just get into networks. So, we started Renowned in 2012, and then we actually did. We got our first show as Renowned about six months after starting the company.” 


	The show was Winner's Circle on Sky, which provided behind-the-scenes access to top U.K. soccer stars. Branded content series FCUK, which followed Olympic Gold medalist boxer Anthony Joshua, and content for online music platform Vevo, such as interviews with top music stars, also helped the firm make a name for itself.

	











	The formula for Winner's Circle became the firm's calling card: fresh factual entertainment or documentary content focused on stories and names that young audiences care about, produced with the latest technology. “We were making the most of new technology that was coming out, producing something that looked really high-end on next to nothing,” highlights Welch. “I worked on sets with the first RED camera that ever arrived in London, learning about it. So, I was one of the first who actually knew how to set it up and use it. So we took all that knowledge and made our show, which Duane hosted, and we shot, produced, directed, edited, did everything, all just the three of us on next to nothing.”


	Bootstrapping was also the name of the game before the Renowned team got a headquarters. Whether blagging a sofa shop as the location for an interview shoot or meeting people at London's South Bank Center or in the cafes of bookstores, the team did it all to succeed without the need for huge budgets. “At Waterstones as well, they've got cafe areas,” Jones shares. “We would buy books, sit in the cafe area for work meetings, and return the books at the end of the day and get the refund. That was our office space.”


	No traditional industry education, no problem, the Renowned team says. “We just learned how to do things by instinct,” explains Jones. “The landscape of production has changed vastly, and not being traditionally trained means that we kind of created our own business models, acumen, and strategy, so to speak, and it just works. It's all about instinct and understanding audiences.” He adds: “It's all about the DIY generation and real hustle, bypassing gatekeepers on all levels. Let's get it done!”

	











	Early on, industry execs were surprised to meet three young guys in pitch meetings. “We would all sit down with these execs who were expecting a bunch of 50-year-old guys,” Withers recalls. “And they were sort of like, ‘What are you doing?' And we were like: ‘We've got all the biggest music artists in the world and a global brand signed up to make this program. Do you want it on your platform?” And they were like: ‘Yeah!' We've had that kind of hustle mindset that has carried on to this day.”


	Another element of the Renowned model came into play early on. “That first show did really well. We ended up keeping the rights to it and sold it to 60 territories, which helped us get a bit of breathing space to do more development,” Welch tells THR. “So we got our next show, F2 Kicks Off [about a British freestyle soccer duo bringing its feats to international soccer stars, chart-topping musicians and regular people], which was better funded, but still did not have a huge budget. It was maybe one of the first shows that ever used YouTube talent on TV, but did so in a way that it elevated what they were doing to a much bigger audience and also opened up the network to a younger audience. And that was the highest-rated show in that spot on the network. And it proved that we can make a show for Channel 4 that will look really elevated and premium, but the budget will still not be as big as if you're doing a global Netflix show, which we're also doing, and that takes a different style of treatment.”

	











	The early success drew attention – and eventually an investment. In 2015, U.K. broadcaster Channel 4 acquired a minority stake in Renowned. But that DIY and hustle mindset remained. 


	The company's ability to work with different scales and budgets and its team's interest in stories from beyond the pond then allowed Renowned to move beyond a U.K. focus. In 2017, Catfish producer Critical Content acquired a stake in Renowned, while Channel 4 exited its stake. Critical Content CEO Tom Forman joined the company's board.


	The two companies' mindsets matched. “Tom was all about doing the best project possible, but also knocking on every door until you got a yes,” says Welch. “I think that's something that we're quite good at still. We don't really take no for an answer, and we'll keep going until we get a yes on a project.”


	2018 was the year that would prove to become, as the Renowned team calls it, a “pivotal” moment. “We'd done the U.K., we'd worked with a lot of the U.K. networks, but all of the shows we were developing, and all of the access and all the characters, were U.S.-centric,” explains Welch. “So all three of us went out there, met all the networks, met a bunch of production companies out there, and just tried to learn the lay of the land, and what they were looking for. How does it differ from the U.K.?”


	The Renowned team then developed a slate with a focus on what they had learned – and got a first show in the form of Bravo's Million Dollar Rooftops. 

	











	Again, the way of working Renowned brought to the table was different. “We pretty much self-funded the pilot, and walked in with it, and they could just see the product in front of them,” Withers tells THR. “We are saying: ‘Here's the access to the talent, here's a 10-minute tape of everything, here's what, realistically, the schedule looks like, here's a really detailed deck.' It's packaged and all ready to go.”


Copwatch America for BET and other projects followed. And while others were hurt by the COVID pandemic, the Renowned team looked at its lessons and new opportunities. “We just sort of looked at each other and said, ‘Why are we spending so much on real estate?' It's just killing our margins,” Withers says. “So we scaled it back slightly and made things a bit more remote. Post-production can become really expensive and draining for the bottom line.” And the company invested in an Avid Nexis network. “We can work anywhere globally, with anyone in the world.”


	In 2022, Crazy Rich Asians studio SK Global acquired Critical Content and its stake in Renowned, with Forman departing, but the Renowned team was happy with the presence and success it had reached in the U.S. and has continued to push to build it further. 


	And the networked tech set-up allows the firm to work across borders. “For the series Making Manson for Peacock, we had our showrunner based in Costa Rica,” highlights Withers. “We had our editors working in London and New York. It paid off really well. So, for every show we do, we're not geolocked. We can bring the best talent from around the world in for a show to make sure that we're doing it as best we can.”

	











	True crime has become one focus for Renowned. “It speaks to what we've always been good at, which is access and finding what's next or a really exciting way into a subject,” argues Welch. “With Manson, we thought there are always the shows that people rip from the headlines. But if we look at serial killers almost as IP in themselves, Manson is so iconic, and the story hasn't been retold for a while, certainly not for a younger audience.”


	But what approach would make sense? Renowned did a deep dive into research, “spending time getting to know the Manson community, building a lot of trust,” says Welch. “A man who had actually become Manson's closest confidant for the last 20 years of his life, while he was in prison, trusted us. We started to get to know this guy who has this treasure trove of unknown things about this entire story. And we got tapes with 100-plus hours of first-hand material that we packaged up to make it immersive.”


	That's the Renowned approach to all its true crime projects. “We try to find an iconic story or a crazy story, get the access, get the tapes, or something else that allows us to walk in and make a show, to use a phrase that we've come up with, undownturnable.”


	But doing all the legwork for this sort of packaging takes much time and effort. “We're working on projects that we probably won't be pitching until 2026, so our development process is quite long,” Withers explains. “But that's what it takes to get a project that you're going to get instant offers on in the room. We likely have 200-plus ideas, but we're focusing our time on 10 projects that are all killer projects.”

	











Loving Elvis is one such example. Again, it looks at an iconic figures through a contemporary lens, exploring the loves, dalliances, and forbidden courtships of Presley. 


	Having read all this, you may not be surprised to hear that the Renowned office includes a burner phone with a number the team gives out to contributors and “some slightly dodgy characters,” as the team says. And when it rings, there's usually a surprise on the other side. 


	Will the company stay focused on true crime, or what does the future of Renowned look like?


	“We're never going to pigeonhole ourselves in one specific area,” says Withers. “The industry is always evolving, so we're always going to be evolving with it. We just want to be at the forefront of that evolution.”


	Jones echoes that. “Yeah, we will just keep it future-facing, keep producing stuff that hopefully moves the needle. It's a balance between style and the content itself. I hate the term ‘premium.' But it's about worthy content that is also in a style that younger generations want to watch. Just give the young people content that they deserve!”

Hannah Frances has announced a new album: Nested in Tangles arrives October 10 via Fire Talk. Frances recorded her follow-up to 2024's Keeper of the Shepherd alongside producer Kevin Copeland, and she also enlisted Grizzly Bear's Daniel Rossen for two songs. Watch her self-directed music video for new single “Surviving You” below.

“‘Surviving You' is a reflection on the ways generational trauma can repeat itself when unexamined, and the ways we learn to protect ourselves through necessity,” Frances said in a press statement. “This is for anyone who grew up in a turbulent and harmful home and is learning to affirm their lived experience.”

Last month, Frances shared the song “Falling From and Further,” which also appears on Nested in Tangles. She has a bunch of shows coming up, including a number headlining dates that take place in the autumn. See Frances' full schedule below.

Jimmy Kimmel‘s dislike of President Donald Trump seems to have reached an inflection point. The late-night host has felt so dismayed by the administration's fascist policies that he's set up a bit of a contingency plan to flee the country altogether if need be. During a recent appearance on The Sarah Silverman podcast, Kimmel informed his ex and fellow comedian that an intercontinental move may be in store after he obtained his Italian citizenship.


	“A lot of people I know are thinking about where are they going to get citizenship?” Silverman said. Kimmel replied, “I did get Italian citizenship,” noting, “What's going on [with Trump] is as bad as you thought it was gonna be. It's so much worse; it's just unbelievable. I feel like it's probably even worse than he would like it to be.”

	Kimmel has been a vocal detractor of Trump during both of his terms. Following Trump's first 100 days in office, the comedian dedicated an opening monologue on his show to roasting the inefficiency of the government. “It's difficult to give Trump's first 100 days a grade, but if I had to I'd say it falls somewhere between F and U,” he said. “Don't get me wrong, there have been some positives. Unfortunately, they have all been pregnancy tests for women who slept with Elon Musk.” Noting how little Trump got done, he said, “None of those achievements are achievements,” he said. “The penny is gone and straws are back. Wow, America really is great again, isn't it? This tells you all you need to know about how things are going for Trump.”

	











	If Kimmel leaves the United States, he would join Rosie O'Donnell and Ellen DeGeneres as celebrities who fled the United States after Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in last November's presidential election.

Travis Kelce‘s relationship with Taylor Swift feels more like the 1989 deep cut “You Are in Love” than the camera-flashing chaos of “Blank Space.” When asked how they keep their romance alive while navigating being in the public eye, the Kansas City Chiefs player told GQ, “Whenever I'm with her, it feels like we're just regular people. When there is not a camera on us, we're just two people that are in love.”


	Kelce and Swift began dating in 2023, when he was fresh off of his team's Super Bowl LVII win and Swift was in the early months of the career-spanning Eras Tour. Some believed they witnessed the couple hard-launch their relationship when Swift attended a Chiefs game after being publicly courted by Kelce, but of course, they had been dating privately for a while before then. “It can be perceived as something else because of how much it is talked about and how much we are tracked whenever we do go out,” Kelce said. “It happened very organically, even though from a media standpoint it was being tracked. It still happened very organically.”

	











	He added, “Nothing I've ever done has been a controlled, organized process. When I say it was so organic, we fell in love just based off the people we were sitting in a room together with. We are two fun-loving people who have the morals to appreciate everyone for who they are. We share all those values. It kind of just took the fuck off.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Their mutual understanding of how to navigate the media landscape is something Kelce values in their relationship. “I hadn't experienced somebody in the same shoes as me, having a partner who understands the scrutiny, understands the ups and downs of being in front of millions,” he said. There was also overlap in the physical demands of their respective careers. “That was very relatable, seeing how exhausted she would get after shows,” Kelce added. “She may not think of herself as an athlete. She will never tell anyone that she is an athlete. But I've seen what she goes through. I've seen the amount of work that she puts on her body, and it's mind-blowing.”

	Kelce managed to catch a few shows on the Eras Tour, waiting in the wings as Swift tweaked her lyrics to shout out “the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me.” He even joined her onstage in London as a dancer during “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.” He's witnessed firsthand how grueling those three-hour-long shows could be.


	“To go out on a stage, on a computer, essentially, for three hours. The [Eras Tour] floor is literally—I've seen underneath that thing. It is a football-field-sized computer,” Kelce said. “You take that into Singapore, where it is scorching hot, and all of a sudden you're feeling the fumes from the computer and you're feeling the fumes from the sun and you're doing a show for three hours with a lot of energy, bringing it every single song. That is arguably more exhausting than how much I put in on a Sunday, and she's doing it three, four, five days in a row.”


	Swift has been to her fair share of Chiefs games, now, too. “I sort of made her a football fan,” Kelce said. “She is the most engulfed fan now. She knows what the injury reports look like. She understands what special situations are, third and short—all these things because she just naturally loves to hear about my job.” He enjoys the balance of showing up for each other. “I get to be the plus one,” he said. “I get to go and be that fan. Because I am a fan. I'm a fan of music. I'm a fan of art. And it's so cool that I get to experience her being that plus one for me on the football field…. I feel that same enjoyment every time she comes to my shows.”


	Kelce is also learning the dynamism of performance from Swift. “Whenever I get in front of a crowd, I feel like I've got to be like, ‘Woooo!' Like, excited, bringing the energy. Then I saw that coolness and that calmness and that relatability that she is so good at presenting,” he said. “I really grabbed that. Like, man, I can use that side of entertainment as well. It's not just always being the guy that brings the energy and creates these exciting moments.”

	“People gravitate towards how she performs and how she makes it feel like the entire stadium is in this little room with her,” he continued. “She is so good at mesmerizing everybody and making everybody feel like it's an intimate situation. I think that alone — there is so much calm and coolness. She's beautiful. She's up there making everyone feel at ease.”


	Later this week, Swift will appear alongside Kelce as a special guest on New Heights, the podcast he hosts with his brother Jason Kelce. In the teaser for the episode, the singer-songwriter announced her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl. Kicking off the rollout together, Kelce is getting another look into how Swift is always “setting goals for herself and exceeding the expectations and really captivating the world in that regard.”

The service, Howdy, is $2.99 monthly and it's based on the idea that consumers want a Netflix add-on with no annoying commercials.


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


	 Roku is dipping its toes in the paid streaming service space, but is entering within its own new niche. 


	On Aug. 5, the company announced the launch of an ad-free streaming service, Howdy, for $2.99 a month. This makes it the cheapest major, general entertainment ad-free streaming service, far below the costs of Netflix, at $18 a month, or Hulu at $19 a month. 




	At launch, it will offer close to 10,000 hours of content from Lionsgate, Warner Bros. Discovery and FilmRise, including Mad Max: Fury Road, The Blind Side, Weeds and Kids in the Hall, alongside select Roku Original titles. That said, Howdy's content is unlikely to rival the breadth of titles and the new content offered on other services. But Roku isn't aiming to compete with them.

					Roku Delivers Stronger Than Expected Platform Revenue, Raises Outlook		
			









	“Priced at less than a cup of coffee, Howdy is ad-free and designed to complement, not compete with, premium services,” Roku founder and CEO Anthony Wood said in the Aug. 5 announcement of the new service.

	The $2.99 monthly subscription comes at the right time, as the average price of ad-free plans has risen 23 percent in the past two years to $13.88, according to data firm Antenna's year-end report on the subscription landscape. Even ad-supported plans come in at a higher cost, with the average price having risen 25 percent.


	That means the service should appeal to those price conscious customers, as well as those who want to watch classic programming, but grow tired of advertising interruptions. According to market research firm Circana, among customers who cancel a streaming subscription, 24 percent do so because of the high cost. At the same time, 21 percent of individuals that are reducing their viewership or stopping their viewership of free, advertising-supported services are doing so because they say there are too many advertisements.

	











	For Roku, analysts see the move as a healthy way for the company to continue diversifying its revenue away from advertising alone and better monetize the traffic that's coming onto the platform. Roku reached more than 90 million streaming households as of January 2025. The new offering joins the platform's Roku Channel, a free, ad-supported streaming platform that was the most popular FAST service in June, according to the Nielsen Gauge. Roku also acquired subscription streaming service Frndly, a $6.99 monthly service which offers 50 live TV channels as well as video content, in May. 


	Roku's platform revenue, which includes advertising and subscription revenue, is already on a solid growth trajectory, with the company reporting revenue up 18 percent year-over-year in its most recent quarter due to the strong performance of video advertising and the acquisition of Frndly. The company included the launch of Howdy in its outlook, with platform revenue set to hit $4.075 billion, up 16 percent year-over-year. Roku is on track to be operating income positive in Q4 of 2025 and for full year 2026.


	“By adding owned and operated subscription services, Roku has an increasing number of ways to monetize the traffic it directs from its home screen: drive users to The Roku Channel (which monetizes through advertising), drive to its subscription services, Frndly and Howdy, drive to third-party apps where it may or may not take a cut of ads and/or subscription fees and drive transactional pay-per-view,” Lightshed analysts Rich Greenfield, Brandon Ross and Mark Kelley said in an Aug. 5 note. 

	











	In adding Howdy into the company's streaming services, John Buffone, vice president and media entertainment industry advisor at Circana, notes that Roku is “playing now in basically all the streaming areas.” Given the popularity of bundling among consumers, Buffone said he could also see Roku offering bundled packages of Howdy alongside Frndly, other streamers or in partnership with third-parties similar to how Walmart's subscription service includes Paramount+.


	“I think this gives them an opportunity to bundle with their company-owned services, with SVOD services that they carry on our operating system. And if they want to go beyond media, there should be a lot of activations available there as well,” Buffone said. 


	The app began automatically appearing on Roku homescreens Aug. 5, which already gives it a free, large reach, and the plan is to launch the service on mobile and other platforms in the future. The only downside for Roku with the service is not having the opportunity to place ads to direct consumers to their other services. 


	“Notably, Roku's only cost to marketing Howdy is the opportunity cost of not marketing other content that might drive a consumer to watch ad-supported content on The Roku Channel,” the Lightshed analysts said.

"People want a little more variety on their plate," says MacFarlane in explaining why comedy is a viable theatrical genre despite Hollywood's fears of its demise. 


							By 

	Mia Galuppo


Film Writer


The Naked Gun has been held up as a bellwether for the viability of studio comedies in the post-pandemic era, and this past weekend, the comedy reboot proved its staying power. The feature, directed by Akiva Schaffer and starring Liam Neeson, dropped just 50 percent in its sophomore outing, bringing its domestic total to $33 million, and its global haul to $56.4 million.


	Producers Seth MacFarlane and Erica Huggins hope The Naked Gun is the first of a new wave of comedies that will find theatrical audiences.




	Outside of Naked Gun, MacFarlane and Huggins-headed Fuzzy Door has a varied slate that runs the gamut from a Peacock series based on the late '80s horror-comedy The Burbs to a doc on Carl Sagan to MacFarlane's Frank Sinatra tribute album Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra. MacFarlane says, “To put it this way: You can make spark plugs and breakfast cereals at the same time, and if there's a market for both, then why not?”

					Original 'Naked Gun' Director Reacts to Reboot's Opening Weekend (Exclusive)		
			









	MacFarlane and Huggins talk to THR about the “double-edged sword” of testing comedies, what lessons Hollywood should take from Naked Gun's performance, and sequel plans.


What has the response been to Naked Gun's performance?


ERICA HUGGINS I've gotten so many incoming calls and texts and emails from well-wishers, and that doesn't always happen. (Laughs.) For the first time, you can feel the goodwill from every single producer, all the agencies, from actors, from people who just want comedy.


SETH MACFARLANE I just got a text from a retired Family Guy writer, which tells you how long the show has been on the air.  “A retired Family Guy writer.” He said he was at a barber shop at Amherst, Massachusetts. It's a six-chair place, and everybody was talking about The Naked Gun.

	











If that isn't a glowing review, I don't know what is. What was the biggest hurdle to get the greenlight on this movie?


HUGGINS The biggest thing to overcome was the question: “Will a movie like this — a spoof movie, that we haven't seen in at least a decade — work for today's audience?” Then, the next question always became, “Who is the audience? Is it nostalgia only? Is it the older crowd? How do we get the younger crowd?” And then it always came back to budget. The other big part to overcome was that we needed dramatic actors to play the comedy, and play it straight.


How did you convince the studio that Liam Neeson was the right choice?


MACFARLANE I don't know that we ever did. Eventually, they just got tired of us. There have been other iterations of this franchise attempted over the years and oftentimes it is a comedian, and usually a terrific comedian, who is announced as the lead. One of the fundamental edicts of the [original Naked Gun creators] Zucker Brothers was you played against the comedy. You cast people like Robert Stack, Peter Graves and Leslie Nielsen. There were no comics, and it just worked every single time when they stuck to that.


In the opening weekend exit numbers, nearly half the audience was in the 18 to 34 demo. What do you make of that?


HUGGINS All the previous Naked Guns were PG-13. Akiva was extremely aware of what that did for him as a kid. It allowed him access, even though it was still a little bit risqué.

	











MACFARLANE Younger audiences don't really have the same comedy filmography attached to their experience of growing up as we did. We had movies like Planes, Trains and Automobiles and Caddyshack. In the '90s, they had comedies like Home Alone and in the early 2000s 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. It's been a while since a generation has had a comedy or series of comedies that define their decade.


The marketing for this movie leaned into the reality that there haven't been broad comedies in theaters. Why do you think that played well?


MACFARLANE It was an easy choice for the studio to just dive into, because there has not been a true, hard comedy in a long time. In the '80s, you had shows like Cheers that were comedies. They had jokes, they had laughs, they were true comedies that would also be recognized during award season. You don't see that anymore. [Today] you see essentially dramas with a smattering of jokes in comedy categories. I think it was pretty easy for the studio to take that reality and say, “Hey, we know what you're looking for. Here's some water in the desert.”


How important is audience testing when it comes to releasing a comedy for modern audiences?


MACFARLANE Testing is such a double-edged sword. It is hugely valuable in the same way that it's hugely valuable to workshop your stand-up set, to know what jokes work and what don't, and to take different parts of the country and see how different audiences react. The only downside is some of the stuff that sticks in the long run, that's the stuff that's a little weirder, so it doesn't really land right away.

	











HUGGINS The things that audiences love the most and hate the most are the things that are most talked about, too. You have to be careful about not just cutting it off because you get a couple of cards that say it offends people. You want to try and find a balance.


The narrative for comedies and movie musicals is that these two genres have to constantly prove themselves every time they go into a theater.


MACFARLANE It sure is!


Heading into opening weekend, did you feel that pressure?


HUGGINS The question was, “Will a comedy work in the theaters?” Because they are so easy to access on Netflix. All the comedies now seem to be accumulating on streaming, and so it's just a different experience from laughing in a crowd. I think [it's about] re-teaching audiences to buy a ticket and go to a packed theater and see a funny movie.


MACFARLANE All the great comedies that we look at as sort of these benchmark moments in our culture and in our own lives, they're all theatrical. I can't really think of a single streaming comedy that has that kind of collective hold on the zeitgeist. Maybe they're out there and I don't know them. Streaming comedies, some of them, of course, being very good, just kind of come and go. There's a tendency to think of the theater as something that's on its way out, but I really think that's a mistake.


What lessons do you want Hollywood to take away from the performance of Naked Gun?


MACFARLANE Take risks. Make movies that aren't just reboots — wait a second. The lesson is that people want something that's outside the usual fare. We're just so deluged with superhero movies at this point that. It's like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, when he wakes up on that last morning, says, “Anything different is good.” People want a little more variety on their plate.

	











Fuzzy Door has a varied slate — from a Peacock series based on The Burbs to a doc on Carl Sagan — what are studios and streamers saying they are buying right now?


HUGGINS I haven't seen a lot of interest in buying a hard comedy. It's harder to understand what that is if you haven't done it. People want something that feels original, and then in the same breath, they want something that everybody already loves. It's about good material, regardless of the genre. We're betting on our taste.


MACFARLANE Taste is everything. There's so much examining of marketing data, which, if it was worth a damn, every movie and TV show would be a huge hit. You look at somebody like Dana Walden, who just has really good taste and just continues to succeed and succeed and succeed. At the end of the day, you have this thing called a brain, and if you're running a production company or a studio it is incumbent on you to use that brain and make decisions based on things that you think are of quality or not, marketing data be damned. People don't want a genre until they do.


Have there been talks about a Naked Gun sequel?


HUGGINS Absolutely. We've now had enough conversations among the filmmakers, and certainly with Pam [Anderson] and Liam, too, when we were selling the movie in the blue sky version of what could happen next, yes, we were thinking about where it could go and what it could be. Akiva and Dan and Doug, our writers, we're all talking about it.

	Is Deadpool joining the Avengers? Ryan Reynolds posted a cryptic image on Instagram last night that suggests his foul-mouthed character may be teaming up with Earth's mightiest heroes in the forthcoming Avengers: Doomsday or Avengers: Secret Wars.


	Reynolds shared a photo of the Avengers black and white logo, which has been covered with a red spray-painted “A” that appears to be the work of Deadpool. Fans were quick to jump on the potential crossover, with many commenting about their excitement. 

A post shared by Ryan Reynolds (@vancityreynolds)


Marvel revealed the enormous cast of Avengers: Doomsday in a livestream in March. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo had previously heralded the return of the franchise's beloved actor, Robert Downey Jr., during an appearance at San Diego Comic-Con in 2024. Downey Jr. will play villain Doctor Doom (despite his longtime character Iron Man dying in Avengers: Endgame), who recently popped up in the post-credits scene in Fantastic Four: First Steps. 

	











	Earlier this year, Reynolds shot down speculation that Deadpool would be part of an Avengers film. “If Deadpool becomes an Avenger or an X-Man, we're at the end,” the actor told Time. “That's wish fulfillment, and you can't give him that.” He added, “I'm writing a little something right now, that's, I don't know, it's an ensemble. But, I like that [Deadpool] is isolated.”

	Deadpool last appeared onscreen in 2024's Deadpool & Wolverine, which reunited Reynolds' beloved character with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. In a review of the film, Rolling Stone noted that the movie by introducing the characters into the MCU, it was “signaling a bold new step towards total superhero-property synergy.”

	











	In May, Marvel Studios announced that Avengers: Doomsday had been moved back from May 1, 2026, to Dec. 18, 2026, while its follow-up will now arrive in theaters on Dec. 17, 2027 instead of May 7, 2027.

HUNTR/X's “Golden” goes up, up, up a spot for its first week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.


	The aspirational song is from the soundtrack to the smash animated Netflix film KPop Demon Hunters and glows as the first Hot 100 leader for the act, whose music is voiced by EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI. The set rules Billboard's Soundtracks chart for a seventh week.


	Notably, “Golden” is the ninth song associated with Korean pop to conquer the Hot 100 — and the first by female lead vocalists. It joins “Seven” by Jung Kook (featuring Latto) and “Like Crazy” by Jimin, both of BTS, in 2023, and BTS' six No. 1s in 2020-21: “Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat),” with Jawsh 685 and Jason Derulo; “Dynamite”; “Life Goes On”; “Butter”; “Permission To Dance”; and “My Universe,” with Coldplay. (HUNTR/X singers EJAE and REI AMI were born in Seoul, South Korea; Nuna is from New Jersey.)


	“Golden” is also the first IRL Hot 100 No. 1 by any act with a fictional background since the ensemble No. 1 “We Don't Talk About Bruno,” which reigned for five weeks in February-March 2022. It, too, was released from a hit animated film, Disney's Encanto, and sung by multiple vocalists as their characters in the movie.


	As for all-women collectives of three or more members, HUNTR/X is the first to top the Hot 100 in 24 years — since Destiny's Child dominated with “Bootylicious” for two weeks in August 2001.


	Plus, Chappell Roan's “The Subway” pulls into the Hot 100 at No. 3, marking her highest debut and rank. The song starts as her fourth top 10.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Aug. 16, 2025) will update on Billboard.com Tuesday, Aug. 12. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Golden,” on Visva/Republic Records, tallied 31.7 million official streams (up 9% week-over-week), 8.4 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 71%) and 7,000 sold (up 35%) in the United States Aug. 1-7.


	The track slays for a third week at No. 1 on Streaming Songs and rises 5-3 for a new best on Digital Song Sales. It makes history in the former metric, as it's the Hot 100's greatest gainer in streaming for a record-breaking sixth straight week. (It surpasses the five weekly wins in a row for Migos' “Bad and Boujee,” featuring Lil Uzi Vert, in early 2017.) “Golden” debuted at No. 81 on the July 5 chart and began its streak the following week.


	Plus, “Golden” is the first non-debuting title to clear 30 million weekly official U.S. streams since Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” in late March. (In between, two songs reached the mark in their first chart weeks: Playboi Carti's “Evil J0rdan” and Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae.)


	Flying colors: “Golden” is the fourth Hot 100 No. 1 with “gold” or “golden” in its title to shine atop the Hot 100.


	Here are all the glittering “gold” records:


	Honorable mentions (silver medals?): 24kGoldn sparkled with “Mood,” featuring iann dior, for eight weeks at No. 1 in 2020-21, and Bobby Goldsboro led with “Honey” for five weeks in 1968.


	(While no songs with “silver” in their names have led topped the Hot 100, “Fly, Robin, Fly” by Silver Convention did for three weeks in 1975.)


	Chappell Roan's “The Subway” rolls into the Hot 100 at No. 3, marking the singer-songwriter's highest career debut and rank as she earns her fourth top 10. All four have hit the top five: “Good Luck, Babe!” and “Pink Pony Club” each rose to No. 4 last September and this April, respectively, and “The Giver” entered at its No. 5 peak in March.


	“The Subway” tallied 25.1 million streams, 787,000 in airplay audience and 6,000 sold in its first full week of tracking (no pun intended), following its July 31 release as a recording. Chappell Roan premiered the song live during her Governors Ball set on June 7, 2024, and built buzz for it by playing it regularly in concert since.


	(The song becomes the highest charting Hot 100 hit with “subway” in its title. Petula Clark rode her classic “Don't Sleep in the Subway” to No. 5 in July 1967.)


	Alex Warren's “Ordinary” drops to No. 2 on the Hot 100 after nine nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in June. It claims an eighth week at No. 1 on Radio Songs (73.6 million, essentially even) and an 11th week atop the Songs of the Summer chart, having led each week since the survey made its seasonal return after Memorial Day.


	Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, dips 3-4 on the Hot 100 after it debuted in May as Wallen's fourth No. 1 and McRae's first. It posts a 12th week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.


	Justin Bieber's No. 2-peaking “Daisies” falls 4-5 on the Hot 100, two weeks after it debuted at its No. 2 high. It's the chart's top gainer in airplay for a second week (20.9 million, up 23%).


	Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” is steady at its No. 6 Hot 100 best, and Wallen's “Just in Case” descends 5-7 after reaching No. 2.


	Saja Boys, HUNTR/X's targets in KPop Demon Hunters, climb 9-8 for a new Hot 100 high with “Your Idol.”


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024 and closed as the year's No. 1 song, backtracks 7-9 as it adds a record-extending 103rd week on the chart overall and a record-boosting 73rd week in the top 10.


	Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” stumbles 8-10, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning in July 2024.

Princess Diana's approach to food was famously disciplined, but her former chef says the Princess of Wales made one notable exception when her sons were around. 

Darren McGrady, who spent 11 years cooking for Queen Elizabeth II before joining Diana at Kensington Palace in 1993, revealed the surprising dish that appeared on the menu only when Princes William and Harry were at the table.

A post shared by Lady Diana, Princess of Wales (@lady.diana._)

As reported by InStyle, McGrady said Diana's day-to-day meals reflected a clean, light style. “She never ate pork,” he said. “Occasionally, she'd have lamb when she was entertaining guests, but for the most part it was chicken, fish, or vegetarian options.” 

He added that the beloved princess “was into healthy eating, so we never had beef on the menu unless the boys were home.”

Moving from Buckingham Palace to Kensington meant reworking his cooking. “When I was cooking for her [Diana], I had to change my style of cooking,” he said. “I had to move from cooking food for the Queen—heavy sauces, rich sauces and creams—to start cooking lighter food again, cutting out the fats, cutting out the carbs.” 

According to McGrady, Diana was clear about the plan: “She would say, ‘You take care of all the fats, and I'll take care of all the carbs at the gym.' So dishes like tomato mousse, which she really liked, she'd say, ‘Make me a fat-free version.'”

A post shared by Lady Diana, Princess of Wales (@lady.diana._)

The royal chef further revealed that the palace menu often shifted toward “nursery-friendly” comfort food when William and Harry were home from boarding school. 

It changed from Princess Diana's healthy eating—stuffed peppers, eggplant, vegetarian dishes—to nursery food,” McGrady said. “Wills and Harry loved cottage pie, pizza, chicken nuggets, French fries, potato wedges, macaroni cheese.”

On occasion, the princess was also known to switch things up. 

McGrady revealed to People that one afternoon, “the princess came in and said, ‘Cancel lunch today. I'm taking them out.'” When he asked where, “she said, ‘McDonald's.'” He protested—“I said, ‘I can do burgers better than McDonald's,'” he remembered—only to get the matter-of-fact response, “she said, ‘I know that, Darren, but they want the toys and the Happy Meal.' They would get fast food sometimes, just like normal families with children.”

Even with those indulgences, the princess balanced discipline with delight—making space for the boys' favorites, a spontaneous drive-thru, and, yes, the occasional beef dinner when William and Harry were home.

	Hours after Taylor Swift fans started buzzing on Monday (Aug. 11) due to clues that a major announcement might be imminent — and that the superstar's 12th studio album might be the subject of that announcement — a mysterious countdown clock appeared on Swift's official website on Monday night. The countdown ends in a few hours, at… 12:12 a.m. ET, on Aug . 12. (See the countdown here.)

	On Monday morning, New Heights — the podcast hosted by Swift's boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother, fellow NFL star Jason Kelce — teased “a VERY special guest” for their new episode on Wednesday, with a social teaser suggesting that Swift would be making an appearance on the show. Minutes later, Taylor Nation, the official fan account for Swift, posted a series of 12 photos of Swift wearing the color orange — hinting at the long-held fan belief that Swift's next era will have an orange theme.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Late Monday night, New Heights officially revealed that Swift would be their guest this week, with Taylor ending the new teaser by saying “We're about to do a f—ing podcast!”


	Although the timing of the New Heights post and the Taylor Nation message nodded toward a major announcement arriving Wednesday, Aug. 13, Swift might be making a splash on the 12th instead. Billboard has reached out to Swift's rep for comment.

	











	Swift's 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, was released last year and scored the biggest Billboard 200 debut of her career, along with another album of the year Grammy nod. The superstar has been relatively quiet since her record-breaking Eras tour wrapped up last December, although the May news that she successfully bought back the master recordings of her first six studio albums did prompt a streaming resurgence for those projects, as well as her entire catalog.

Angelina Jolie is on the brink of making some major life changes at 50. The Academy Award winner is ready to let go of her treasured Los Angeles estate, which could take her far from the city she has called home for decades.

As per a report in People published on 11th August, Jolie has “put the house up for sale” as she explores a move abroad. Page Six was the first outlet to break the news.

Jolie “never wanted to live in L.A. full time,” the source explains. “She didn't have a choice because of the custody arrangement with Brad.” 

The “Maria” actress shares six children with ex-husband Brad Pitt: Maddox, 24, Pax, 21, Zahara, 20, Shiloh, 19, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 17.

The source says Jolie “plans to relocate as soon as Knox and Viv turn 18 next year. She's eyeing several locations abroad. She'll be very happy when she's able to leave Los Angeles.”

Another insider confirms that the “Without Blood” writer-director will sell the home after making minor improvements. Jolie bought the 1913-built property in 2017 for $24.5 million. Spanning 11,000 square feet, the estate features six bedrooms, ten bathrooms, and sweeping historic charm. See more photos of Jolie's estate here.

Jolie's home holds a special place in Hollywood history. Director Cecil B. DeMille purchased it in 1916 for under $28,000.

Years later, he acquired and combined it with a neighboring property once owned by Charlie Chaplin. “It's a historic masterpiece and truly such a beautiful estate,” the source notes.

Jolie has been open about her desire to live abroad. In a 2024 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, she shared that she remains in Los Angeles “because I have to be here from a divorce.” 

She added, “When you have a big family, you want them to have privacy, peace, safety. I have a house now to raise my children, but sometimes this place can be … that humanity that I found across the world is not what I grew up with here.”

Once her twins turn 18, she plans to spend “a lot of time in Cambodia,” where she adopted Maddox in 2002. “I'll spend time visiting my family members wherever they may be in the world,” she said. Cambodia, she added, is the one place “in my heart” she considers her true home.

As her ex-husband Brad Pitt moves forward, Jolie is also embracing a fresh chapter filled with new possibilities.

If you love your mysteries with a touch of the supernatural, then this list is for you. Psychic detective stories bring an eerie twist to crime-solving, blending intuitive insight with spine-chilling suspense. These protagonists aren't just reading clues, they're reading minds, seeing visions and stepping into the unknown to crack cases that leave ordinary investigators stumped. Whether you enjoy dark thrillers, quirky paranormals or deeply emotional psychological mysteries, these audiobooks deliver suspenseful stories packed with psychic sleuthing.

So, plug in your headphones, close your eyes (unless you're driving, of course) and get ready for a binge-worthy lineup of gripping audiobooks that'll keep you guessing until the last second.

Performed by Joshua Jackson, Oracle is a psychological thriller that introduces Nate Russo, an FBI psychic with a disturbing ability. When he touches someone close to a victim, he sees the terrifying moments leading up to their disappearance. It's a gift that comes at a terrible cost, eating away at Russo's mind as he's pulled into a complex investigation involving missing girls, a chilling conspiracy and a darkness that may consume him. Pyper's writing is razor-sharp and atmospheric and Jackson's performance adds a grounded, emotional intensity to this tense, haunting narrative. Perfect for listeners who want the psychological weight of Mindhunter with a paranormal twist.

While Amos Decker isn't a psychic, his mind works in ways that are just as intriguing. After a devastating hit on the football field, he developed hyperthymesia and synesthesia, which means he forgets nothing and experiences memories through vivid colors and textures. This uncanny mental landscape makes him a formidable detective, especially when a shocking massacre strikes close to home. Memory Man launches Baldacci's bestselling series with grit and emotional depth, while the audiobook — expertly narrated by Ron McLarty and Orlagh Cassidy — hits a perfect rhythm for fans of cerebral, character-driven thrillers.

Samantha Blair has spent her life tormented by psychic visions, violent flashes that crash into her mind without warning, leaving her shaken and terrified. But when one of these waking nightmares reveals a murder in chilling, visceral detail, she risks everything to bring the truth to the police. Detective Brandt Sutherland, skeptical but intrigued, soon learns that Sam's gift is as real as it is harrowing. Tuesday's Child blends romantic suspense with a gripping psychic-mystery hook, crafting a heroine whose courage burns through the darkness of her visions. Perfect for readers who want their thrills tangled with heart and high stakes.

August Chase isn't just a private eye … he's a narcoleptic investigator who can step directly into the crimes he's solving. Each time sleep claims him, his dreams reconstruct the scene through the victim's eyes, turning slumber into an intentional act of detection. In Dream State, a missing person case draws him into a world far stranger and deadlier than expected. Hinckley marries noir grit with surreal dream imagery, creating an atmosphere both hypnotic and hard-edged. The audiobook's pacing and style are pitch-perfect for fans of unconventional sleuths and supernatural-noir blends.

A cheeky, genre-bending mystery, The Misadventure of the Psychic Detective follows Ethan Bell, a British psychic with a sarcastic streak and a talent for finding trouble. When a séance goes sideways, Ethan stumbles into a bizarre murder mystery full of ghosts, oddball suspects and more twists than a Victorian penny dreadful. Stadon's writing is sharp and witty and the audiobook brings Ethan's dry humor and chaotic charm to life. It's equal parts parody and homage, perfect for listeners who enjoy their supernatural sleuthing with a heavy dose of irreverent fun.

Mary Bergen has psychic visions that help the police track down brutal killers, but her gift comes from trauma. When she begins having disturbing visions of murders that haven't happened yet, Mary is forced to confront her past, her darkest fears and a deadly truth that's closing in fast. The Vision is classic Koontz: fast-paced, eerie and emotionally charged. The audiobook builds a tense atmosphere as the line between premonition and reality begins to blur. If you're drawn to dark psychological suspense with supernatural elements and a strong female lead, this one should be on your list.

Willa is a small-town psychic who sees violent messages in bones — literal messages etched into remains. When a child's remains are found with a chilling message that only she can interpret, Willa is dragged into a case that exposes secrets buried deep in her community. Message in the Bones is the first in a paranormal crime series that blends rural mystery with chilling clairvoyance. Merriman paints a vivid picture of trauma, intuition and personal strength, while the narrator brings Willa's voice to life with empathy and urgency. This series is ideal for fans of slower-burn mysteries with haunting, human stakes.

Monique Snyman's mind is a confusing bedlam of glitter and death, where candy-coated gore is found in abundance and homicidal unicorns thrive. Sorting out the mess in her head is particularly irksome before she's ingested a specific amount of coffee, which is equal to half the recommended intake of water for humans per day. When she's not playing referee to her imaginary friends or trying to overdose on caffeine, she's doing something with words—be it writing, reading, or editing.

Monique Snyman lives in Pretoria, South Africa, with her husband, daughter, and an adorable Chihuahua. She's the author of the Bram Stoker Award® nominated novels, The Night Weaver and The Bone Carver, and the South African horror series, Dark Country . Visit moniquesnyman.com to find out more!

In addition to ‘Rick and Morty', Roller has also written for ‘Community', ‘Speechless', ‘Son of Zorn', and ‘Archer'.

Netflix will soon have a new show for “fans of comedy, horror, horror comedy, families, hotels, cults, monsters with tentacles, monsters without tentacles, werewolves, and blenders.” That's according to Matt Roller, Rick and Morty writer and creator of Haunted Hotel, a new paranormal comedy heading to Netflix next month.

Haunted Hotel will follow a single mother of two who struggles to run a haunted hotel. She receives some help from her estranged brother, who is now one of the ghosts haunting the hotel. The first season will have 10 episodes.

The main cast will be voiced by Will Forte, Eliza Coupe, Skyler Gisondo, Natalie Palamides, and Jimmi Simpson. 

Netflix's Director of Adult Animation, Billy Wee, said “Haunted Hotel is wildly inventive and I'm very grateful to Matt, Chris, Dan, and their team for bringing their talents to Netflix…They are phenomenal collaborators and I can't wait for fans all over the world to experience this hilarious show.”

Haunted Hotel will premiere on Netflix on September 19.

"I'm bad at talking," the rapper said on "Watch What Happens Live" with Andy Cohen. "I shouldn't have came on a talk show."

 Recording artist MGK — formerly known as Machine Gun Kelly — does not think he's from the earthly realm, according to himself (and his alleged interplanetary bloodline).


 During a Sunday night appearance on Andy Cohen's Bravo talk show Watch What Happens Live, the rapper (previously reported to be 35 years old, but now TBD) responded to a question about his age in a state of confusion.


 "It's a weird thing, dude, I don't know if my age... I don't know if it exists," he said.

 Cohen asked, "You have a Mariah Carey connection to your age? It's very fluid?" with reference to Carey's admitted refusal to acknowledge time.


 "I don't know many facts about my life, so I don't know," MGK responded. "I'm starting to be like, if my skin rips open, it heals really quick. I'm starting to be like, who's my dad?"


 Cohen pressed on, asking, "Do you think you could be otherworldly?" to which MGK responded, "I asked my mom, is there any period of time you went missing? A tall, slender creature?"


 Fellow WWHL guest Pamela Adlon quipped, "That tracks," before MGK continued.


 "She told me she felt like she got abducted at one point," recalled MGK. "I'm bad at talking, I shouldn't have came on a talk show."


 Entertainment Weekly has reached out to a representative for MGK for additional information on his suspected alien heritage.


 Perhaps MGK is who The View moderator Whoopi Goldberg warned her cohosts about in March 2024, when she confirmed live on the air that aliens are, in fact, walking among us on earth.


 "I think they're waiting for us to clean up a little bit so that they can come here and tell us we're really messing things up," View guest Kumail Nanjiani joked about alien beings, before Goldberg responded in earnest with her findings about extraterrestrial existence.


 "They're already here," she said, calmly. "They're already ... They've been here for quite some time."


 A stunned Nanjiani turned to Goldberg for more information, as the Ghost actress did not reveal how — or why — she knew of her findings that she brought to the Hot Topics table.

 "And what are they doing?" he asked, to which she responded: "They're watching us." Or, perhaps they're simply singing the 2016 song "Bad Things" (feat. Camilla Cabello).

Jared Padalecki revealed the one Supernatural relationship that he wishes had not happened. Over the 15 seasons that Supernatural aired, Sam and Dean Winchester had many different relationships, especially Dean, who was a notorious womanizer. However, rather interestingly, despite being the “ladies man” of the CW show, Dean actually had fewer love interests than Sam.

Although Supernatural ended in 2020, fans and stars of the show are still reflecting on its legacy, with Jensen Ackles (Dean) and Jared Padalecki (Sam) attending various fan conventions around the world. One of the things that was recently discussed was their characters' decisions in the show, which brought up an interesting comment from Padalecki about Sam Winchester's love interests.

At a FAN EXPO Boston panel, in which ScreenRant was in attendance, Padalecki was asked if Sam would make any decisions differently now. Padalecki responded that he doesn't think Sam would have gotten into a relationship with Amelia. He also expressed that he wished Sam had looked harder for Dean when he was in Purgatory. Check out his quote below:

Amelia. I don't think he would've gotten into a romantic relationship after his brother… over a dog, yeah.

 Amelia Richardson (Liane Balaban) was a veterinarian introduced in season 8. She became a love interest of Sam's while Dean was missing and presumed dead in Purgatory. The two formed an unlikely bond after Sam accidentally hit a dog with his car, leading to a quiet suburban storyline that was somewhat disconnected from the show's supernatural drama.

Padalecki's comment seems to suggest that he agrees with some of the fan criticism surrounding Amelia, which states that the relationship felt forced and Sam's lack of focus on finding his missing brother felt out of sync with the Winchesters' usual actions. The “over a dog” remark only highlights how Padalecki seemingly felt the relationship was a bit too convenient.

 While there was nothing particularly wrong with Amelia's character, the whole romantic plotline with Sam did feel strangely out of place at the time. Amelia was an interesting addition in season 8, as she brought a complicated relationship with her presumed-dead husband, who eventually returns. Interestingly, she is also one of Supernatural's few major love interest characters who doesn't die.

Yet, as Dean and Castiel vanished into Purgatory after fighting Dick Roman and the Leviathans, one of Supernatural's most powerful creatures, it wasn't the right time for Sam's romantic subplot. It was almost too obviously a mirror of Dean's relationship with Lisa when Sam was presumed dead in Supernatural season 6, and for that reason, Padalecki's comments are justified.

Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3, episode 5 introduced a chilling new villain that exceeds the threat posed by the Gorn.

Titus Welliver takes on a new role as a troubled NYPD officer in this thrilling mob series that could finally fill the void left by the end of Narcos.

Intense martial arts action and fight scenes aren't limited to the big screen, as these incredibly martial arts TV shows all prove.

Crime dramas feel a dime a dozen in the 2020s, which makes this hit Amazon Prime Video series' ability to stand out all the more impressive.

Some of the best TV shows ever are in the crime drama genre, and HBO Max has the very best of these original series available to stream.

One major Supernatural star suggests that the show's earliest major villain was far from the scariest, as that honor fell to a normal human.

And it could have massive implications for Mars' volcanic past. 

If you dial the Psychic Reading number posted at the intersection of Webb Road and 13th Avenue, you will reach a woman in Lincoln.

Honey Miller is the person who operates Psychic Readings, which has offices in Lincoln and Grand Island.

She's had the office at the high-traffic Grand Island intersection for 10 or 15 years. Her location is at 115 in the Executive Suites strip mall, where the most prominent business is a State Farm office.

Psychic readings by Honey is located at 1233 N. Webb Road in Grand Island.

At her Lincoln office, she does more readings in person than over the phone.

Miller has been doing readings for a long time.

“I'm a third-generation psychic. This is the only thing I've ever done. I've never had any other kind of job,” she said.

Why should people call her?

“I don't like tooting my own horn,” she said. “I'm not that kind of person. But people do say my readings are accurate, and they enjoy being around me, and they enjoy my service.”

Many call her because they're “going through a hard time,” she said. They may have worries about a lot of things.

“And they need something to help them. They need a little clarity, a little guidance,” she said.

“Because some people don't have support, and even if they do have support, there's things that they don't feel comfortable telling just anybody about,” she said.

Psychic readings by Honey is located at 1233 N. Webb Road in Grand Island.

Many people want “to know how a certain situation's going to go. I do my best to help them with that.”

Many tell her they feel much better when they leave, she said. They feel their questions have been answered.

“They tell me that I'm kind, that it's like a pleasure to either talk to me or see me.”

Seeing her, they say, is like going to a friend.

All of her readings are private and confidential. She takes what she does very seriously, she says.

In addition to her own ability, Miller uses tarot cards and does palm readings. Crystal and crystal ball readings are also part of her arsenal. She does not do astrology.

Miller uses her Grand Island office only occasionally.

“I used to come there all the time. But since COVID, not as much.” She does plan to visit the Grand Island office more often.

She speaks fondly of the Grand Island office. “I like it there. The place has got a good energy.”

She knows that some people regard psychic reading as bunk.

How does she react to that?

“I'm going to be honest. I'm pretty tough-skinned,” she said.

Many people who contact her are skeptics. “But they don't leave skeptics.”

How long does a session last?

“It really depends on what reading the person chooses, because I have a lot of readings.”

How much does a psychic reading cost?

Sometimes Miller runs a special. “I'm not running the special right now, but my readings typically start at $15.”

The sign on her Grand Island door invites people to make an appointment. Her phone number is 308-850-8939.

After initially cracking jokes about existing "in the Matrix" following the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, podcast host Joe Rogan later cautioned his audience that "conspiracies are real" while diving deeper into the shocking incident.

Rogan expressed disbelief at the glaring failures by the U.S. Secret Service that allowed Trump to be wounded in the ear and suggested there might be hidden elements to the story. Trump was targeted during a rally last summer in Butler, Pennsylvania, with the gunman later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks.

The attacker was eliminated by the Secret Service after his botched assassination bid, having opened fire with a rifle from a neighboring rooftop, though it has since emerged that multiple rally attendees alerted officials about Crooks' location after spotting him with a weapon. It comes after a bizarre close-up photo of Trump's ear caused a wave of new conspiracies one year after the shooting.

The FBI has been investigating Crooks and the July 13 events, while the Secret Service claimed in the aftermath it was conducting an internal examination. The episode has sparked numerous conspiracy theories, and Rogan confessed on his "Joe Rogan Experience" podcast that the pieces don't fit together perfectly.

"The more you read about it, the more you're, like, 'What is going on?'" Rogan told comedian Sam Morril, who appeared as a guest on the program. "They knew that there was a suspicious person 10 minutes before Trump went on stage; they still let him go on stage.

"They saw him on the ------- roof and they didn't engage. They saw him on the roof with a rifle. They wouldn't put Secret Service agents on the roof because they said there was a slope to the roof, and it would be dangerous."

Morril then declared: "It's more dangerous if the ex-president gets shot, which he did." Rogan responded by saying: "Dude, it's so crazy, and the fact that they had such poor security guarding him. Like, they did such a terrible job."

Rogan then issued a warning by stating he wasn't suggesting an alternative theory but reminded his audience that he doesn't always trust the official government account. "I'm not accusing anybody of anything - just want to be real clear - but they have organized assassinations before," Rogan added. "And when they organize assassinations, it looks just like that.

"And when they organize assassinations, one of the things they like to do is have some ------- loser kill the president and then they kill the ------- loser, and that's a wrap. This kid kind of, like, stops all the leads."

Rogan couldn't resist questioning why the authorities didn't stop Crooks, and even pondered the possibility of him being recruited. "If you're Secret Service, you see someone with a range finder walking 150 yards from where the president is, you tackle that ------- guy. You don't let that guy get on a ladder," Rogan stated.

"If I was some shadowy intelligence agency that did these, you know, undercover operations that are a little sketchy, I'd find kids like [the shooter]. That's your moneymaker. That's how you do it. If you've got a plan and you want to do something, you get some guy that's basically got nothing going on in life and then you know you mentor him, become friends with him.

"Maybe that guy's dad is an alcoholic who beats [him]. You know, maybe his mom is a ------- junkie. Who knows? Maybe his life is terrible, and you can provide mentorship and you can provide, you know, just camaraderie. Something [to make the potential shooter say], 'Wow, I wish I was a secret agent.' And then you tell this guy, you tell this kid, 'Hey, you could help America. We can work you into the program. You could be one of us.'".

Rogan's chat with Morril then shifted to another infamous presidential assassination, after John F. Kennedy was shot and killed back in 1963.

The Kennedy story is one of the most notorious conspiracy topics in U.S. history, and Rogan didn't hold back his thoughts on the matter.

"Listen, conspiracies are real," Rogan declared. "I mean, whatever the ---- happened in Dallas, Texas, in 1963, it's not what they tell you. That's one thing; 100 percent you're going to be sure. There is no objective journalism with no slant."

It comes after Rogan previously turned on Trump as a scandal engulfed his presidency.
