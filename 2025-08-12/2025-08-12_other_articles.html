                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Psychic detective stories bring an eerie twist to crime-solving, blending intuitive insight with spine-chilling suspense. These protagonists aren't just reading clues, they're reading minds, seeing visions and stepping into the unknown to crack cases that leave ordinary investigators stumped. Whether you enjoy dark thrillers, quirky paranormals or deeply emotional psychological mysteries, these audiobooks deliver suspenseful stories packed with psychic sleuthing. So, plug in your headphones, close your eyes (unless you're driving, of course) and get ready for a binge-worthy lineup of gripping audiobooks that'll keep you guessing until the last second. Performed by Joshua Jackson, Oracle is a psychological thriller that introduces Nate Russo, an FBI psychic with a disturbing ability. Pyper's writing is razor-sharp and atmospheric and Jackson's performance adds a grounded, emotional intensity to this tense, haunting narrative. Perfect for listeners who want the psychological weight of Mindhunter with a paranormal twist. While Amos Decker isn't a psychic, his mind works in ways that are just as intriguing. Memory Man launches Baldacci's bestselling series with grit and emotional depth, while the audiobook — expertly narrated by Ron McLarty and Orlagh Cassidy — hits a perfect rhythm for fans of cerebral, character-driven thrillers. But when one of these waking nightmares reveals a murder in chilling, visceral detail, she risks everything to bring the truth to the police. Tuesday's Child blends romantic suspense with a gripping psychic-mystery hook, crafting a heroine whose courage burns through the darkness of her visions. Perfect for readers who want their thrills tangled with heart and high stakes. August Chase isn't just a private eye … he's a narcoleptic investigator who can step directly into the crimes he's solving. Each time sleep claims him, his dreams reconstruct the scene through the victim's eyes, turning slumber into an intentional act of detection. Hinckley marries noir grit with surreal dream imagery, creating an atmosphere both hypnotic and hard-edged. It's equal parts parody and homage, perfect for listeners who enjoy their supernatural sleuthing with a heavy dose of irreverent fun. Mary Bergen has psychic visions that help the police track down brutal killers, but her gift comes from trauma. When she begins having disturbing visions of murders that haven't happened yet, Mary is forced to confront her past, her darkest fears and a deadly truth that's closing in fast. The Vision is classic Koontz: fast-paced, eerie and emotionally charged. If you're drawn to dark psychological suspense with supernatural elements and a strong female lead, this one should be on your list. Message in the Bones is the first in a paranormal crime series that blends rural mystery with chilling clairvoyance. Merriman paints a vivid picture of trauma, intuition and personal strength, while the narrator brings Willa's voice to life with empathy and urgency. This series is ideal for fans of slower-burn mysteries with haunting, human stakes. Monique Snyman's mind is a confusing bedlam of glitter and death, where candy-coated gore is found in abundance and homicidal unicorns thrive. Sorting out the mess in her head is particularly irksome before she's ingested a specific amount of coffee, which is equal to half the recommended intake of water for humans per day. When she's not playing referee to her imaginary friends or trying to overdose on caffeine, she's doing something with words—be it writing, reading, or editing. Monique Snyman lives in Pretoria, South Africa, with her husband, daughter, and an adorable Chihuahua.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"I'm bad at talking," the rapper said on "Watch What Happens Live" with Andy Cohen. "I shouldn't have came on a talk show." Recording artist MGK — formerly known as Machine Gun Kelly — does not think he's from the earthly realm, according to himself (and his alleged interplanetary bloodline). During a Sunday night appearance on Andy Cohen's Bravo talk show Watch What Happens Live, the rapper (previously reported to be 35 years old, but now TBD) responded to a question about his age in a state of confusion. "It's a weird thing, dude, I don't know if my age... I don't know if it exists," he said. Cohen asked, "You have a Mariah Carey connection to your age? "I don't know many facts about my life, so I don't know," MGK responded. "I'm starting to be like, if my skin rips open, it heals really quick. I'm starting to be like, who's my dad?" to which MGK responded, "I asked my mom, is there any period of time you went missing? Fellow WWHL guest Pamela Adlon quipped, "That tracks," before MGK continued. Entertainment Weekly has reached out to a representative for MGK for additional information on his suspected alien heritage. Perhaps MGK is who The View moderator Whoopi Goldberg warned her cohosts about in March 2024, when she confirmed live on the air that aliens are, in fact, walking among us on earth. "I think they're waiting for us to clean up a little bit so that they can come here and tell us we're really messing things up," View guest Kumail Nanjiani joked about alien beings, before Goldberg responded in earnest with her findings about extraterrestrial existence. A stunned Nanjiani turned to Goldberg for more information, as the Ghost actress did not reveal how — or why — she knew of her findings that she brought to the Hot Topics table.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jared Padalecki revealed the one Supernatural relationship that he wishes had not happened. Although Supernatural ended in 2020, fans and stars of the show are still reflecting on its legacy, with Jensen Ackles (Dean) and Jared Padalecki (Sam) attending various fan conventions around the world. One of the things that was recently discussed was their characters' decisions in the show, which brought up an interesting comment from Padalecki about Sam Winchester's love interests. Padalecki responded that he doesn't think Sam would have gotten into a relationship with Amelia. Amelia Richardson (Liane Balaban) was a veterinarian introduced in season 8. She became a love interest of Sam's while Dean was missing and presumed dead in Purgatory. The two formed an unlikely bond after Sam accidentally hit a dog with his car, leading to a quiet suburban storyline that was somewhat disconnected from the show's supernatural drama. Padalecki's comment seems to suggest that he agrees with some of the fan criticism surrounding Amelia, which states that the relationship felt forced and Sam's lack of focus on finding his missing brother felt out of sync with the Winchesters' usual actions. While there was nothing particularly wrong with Amelia's character, the whole romantic plotline with Sam did feel strangely out of place at the time. Amelia was an interesting addition in season 8, as she brought a complicated relationship with her presumed-dead husband, who eventually returns. Interestingly, she is also one of Supernatural's few major love interest characters who doesn't die. Yet, as Dean and Castiel vanished into Purgatory after fighting Dick Roman and the Leviathans, one of Supernatural's most powerful creatures, it wasn't the right time for Sam's romantic subplot. It was almost too obviously a mirror of Dean's relationship with Lisa when Sam was presumed dead in Supernatural season 6, and for that reason, Padalecki's comments are justified. Supernatural is a television series that follows brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, who were raised by their father to hunt and combat supernatural entities after losing their mother to a demonic force. Traversing the American landscape in their '67 Chevy Impala, they face numerous paranormal threats. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Titus Welliver takes on a new role as a troubled NYPD officer in this thrilling mob series that could finally fill the void left by the end of Narcos. Crime dramas feel a dime a dozen in the 2020s, which makes this hit Amazon Prime Video series' ability to stand out all the more impressive. One major Supernatural star suggests that the show's earliest major villain was far from the scariest, as that honor fell to a normal human.</p>

If you dial the Psychic Reading number posted at the intersection of Webb Road and 13th Avenue, you will reach a woman in Lincoln. Honey Miller is the person who operates Psychic Readings, which has offices in Lincoln and Grand Island. Her location is at 115 in the Executive Suites strip mall, where the most prominent business is a State Farm office. Psychic readings by Honey is located at 1233 N. Webb Road in Grand Island. At her Lincoln office, she does more readings in person than over the phone. Miller has been doing readings for a long time. This is the only thing I've ever done. I've never had any other kind of job,” she said. “I don't like tooting my own horn,” she said. But people do say my readings are accurate, and they enjoy being around me, and they enjoy my service.” Many call her because they're “going through a hard time,” she said. They may have worries about a lot of things. “And they need something to help them. “Because some people don't have support, and even if they do have support, there's things that they don't feel comfortable telling just anybody about,” she said. Psychic readings by Honey is located at 1233 N. Webb Road in Grand Island. I do my best to help them with that.” They feel their questions have been answered. Seeing her, they say, is like going to a friend. All of her readings are private and confidential. In addition to her own ability, Miller uses tarot cards and does palm readings. Miller uses her Grand Island office only occasionally. “I used to come there all the time. But since COVID, not as much.” She does plan to visit the Grand Island office more often. She speaks fondly of the Grand Island office. She knows that some people regard psychic reading as bunk. “It really depends on what reading the person chooses, because I have a lot of readings.” “I'm not running the special right now, but my readings typically start at $15.” The sign on her Grand Island door invites people to make an appointment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After initially cracking jokes about existing "in the Matrix" following the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, podcast host Joe Rogan later cautioned his audience that "conspiracies are real" while diving deeper into the shocking incident. Trump was targeted during a rally last summer in Butler, Pennsylvania, with the gunman later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. The attacker was eliminated by the Secret Service after his botched assassination bid, having opened fire with a rifle from a neighboring rooftop, though it has since emerged that multiple rally attendees alerted officials about Crooks' location after spotting him with a weapon. It comes after a bizarre close-up photo of Trump's ear caused a wave of new conspiracies one year after the shooting. The episode has sparked numerous conspiracy theories, and Rogan confessed on his "Joe Rogan Experience" podcast that the pieces don't fit together perfectly. Rogan told comedian Sam Morril, who appeared as a guest on the program. "They knew that there was a suspicious person 10 minutes before Trump went on stage; they still let him go on stage. They saw him on the roof with a rifle. They wouldn't put Secret Service agents on the roof because they said there was a slope to the roof, and it would be dangerous." Morril then declared: "It's more dangerous if the ex-president gets shot, which he did." Rogan responded by saying: "Dude, it's so crazy, and the fact that they had such poor security guarding him. Like, they did such a terrible job." Rogan then issued a warning by stating he wasn't suggesting an alternative theory but reminded his audience that he doesn't always trust the official government account. "I'm not accusing anybody of anything - just want to be real clear - but they have organized assassinations before," Rogan added. "And when they organize assassinations, it looks just like that. "And when they organize assassinations, one of the things they like to do is have some ------- loser kill the president and then they kill the ------- loser, and that's a wrap. This kid kind of, like, stops all the leads." Rogan couldn't resist questioning why the authorities didn't stop Crooks, and even pondered the possibility of him being recruited. You don't let that guy get on a ladder," Rogan stated. "If I was some shadowy intelligence agency that did these, you know, undercover operations that are a little sketchy, I'd find kids like [the shooter]. "Maybe that guy's dad is an alcoholic who beats [him]. You know, maybe his mom is a ------- junkie. We can work you into the program. Rogan's chat with Morril then shifted to another infamous presidential assassination, after John F. Kennedy was shot and killed back in 1963. That's one thing; 100 percent you're going to be sure. It comes after Rogan previously turned on Trump as a scandal engulfed his presidency.
