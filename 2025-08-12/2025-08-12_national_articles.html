                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Bondi meeting: DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, after meeting Attorney General Pam Bondi, said she's focused on “how to make the most of the additional officer support that we have.” It's a busy week for President Donald Trump as the administration's asserts its control of Washington, DC's Metropolitan Police Department while the US leader prepares for a meeting Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. CNN's Maureen Chowdhury, Holmes Lybrand, Kevin Liptak, Casey Gannon, Shania Shelton, Donald Judd, Adam Cancryn, Kit Maher, Ted Barrett, Helen Regan, Nina Subkhanberdina, Catherine Nicholls and Betsy Klein contributed to this post. DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro was pressed today on what changes she'd like to see when it comes to sentencing and punishment for those who commit the crimes in the city. “Anyone who wants to tell me the crime is down and that we don't need an emergency focus on crimes of violence, all they need to do is take a look at this and talk to the loved ones and the family members of these individuals all shot and killed,” Pirro said. She was asked about DC crime during a news conference announcing an indictment against Haitian gang leader Jimmy Cherizier, also known as “Barbecue.” The DC Metropolitan Police Department will seek to dismantle any remaining homeless encampments in the district, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters today. “They have not been enforced, which is part of the reason for this nationalizing of the National Guard, to bring in this assistance for law enforcement while we are targeting criminals and trying to remove criminals off of the streets,” she said. “We're exploring how we could do that — but again, homeless shelters, offered addiction and mental health services, or jail if they refuse, are the options on the table right now, and we'll continue to explore that option,” she said. President Donald Trump tapped Terrance Cole as interim federal commissioner of the DC Metropolitan Police Department. “Terry Cole, as you heard from this briefing room yesterday, is in charge of the Metropolitan Police Department, and he's working with the chief to ensure that law enforcement officers are allowed to do their jobs in this city,” Leavitt told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. The assertion came after DC leaders signaled they did not expect significant organizational changes at the department because of the federal takeover, while vowing to work with their federal partners and seeking to downplay any controversy. Leavitt characterized Cole as tasked with working with Smith, adding that both of them would report up to Attorney General Pam Bondi for the duration of the 30-day federal takeover. She also declined to rule out the possibility of firing DC police officers, while noting that there are no current plans to do so. President Donald Trump will meet one-on-one with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of their summit on Friday in Alaska, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN during the press briefing today. Trump expects to focus squarely on ending the war in Ukraine, leaving other issues the Kremlin has said could be up for discussion — including normalizing US-Russia ties — for another time. Why this matters: Trump and Putin have met individually, without aides, previously. Then in 2018, they sat one-on-one in Helsinki, Finland, after which Trump sided with Putin over US intelligence agencies on the question of Russian election interference. It's not atypical for leaders to meet alone with their counterparts, but Trump and Putin's relationship has been the subject of intense scrutiny. And during Trump's first term, even senior officials said they sometimes were left in the dark about what was discussed when aides were left out. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov today discussed the upcoming meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, according to Russia's foreign ministry. Rubio and Lavrov spoke about “certain aspects of preparation” for the meeting, which will take place on Friday in Alaska, the Russian foreign ministry said. “Both sides confirmed their commitment to a successful meeting,” it said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that President Donald Trump is mainly focused “making DC safe and beautiful again,” when asked about his remarks about crime in other cities in the country. Trump called out Chicago, New York and Los Angeles for their crime rates when he announced his plans to take control of the DC Metropolitan Police Department yesterday. “Right now, this administration is focused on making DC safe and beautiful again … but I will note that the president wants to see all of our nation's cities be safe. But I think starting with our nation's capital is a great place to begin, and it should serve as a model for the rest of the country.” For context: Memphis, Cleveland and St. Louis have the highest overall crime rates among US cities with a population of at least 250,000, according to the FBI's Crime Database. Memphis, Detroit and Baltimore top the database for violent crime rates among cities of at least 250,000 people, while Washington, DC, ranks 17th. These numbers rely on reporting from local jurisdictions and are not exhaustive of all crime that occurs. The CNN FactCheck team contributed reporting to this post. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it was “unfortunate” that a federal judge this week rejected the Trump administration's efforts to unseal grand jury materials relating to Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking case. Of course, we moved to unseal that information because the president has said he wants to see credible evidence released,” Leavitt said at today's White House briefing. President Donald Trump is traveling to Anchorage for a bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said as she nodded to the fact that Ukraine will not be represented. The logistics of the event, including timing and plans for a potential joint press conference, are “still being ironed out,” she told reporters at today's White House press briefing. The White House characterized President Donald Trump's upcoming meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “listening exercise,” appearing to downplay expectations for a peace deal heading into the high-stakes summit in Alaska on Friday. Look, only one party that's involved in this war is going to be present, and so this is for the president to go and to get, again, a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end,” Leavitt told reporters at the White House briefing. President Donald Trump is considering “suing” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said today. This comes after Trump posted on Truth Social earlier in the day that he was “considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed.” President Donald Trump's order to take control of Washington, DC's Metropolitan Police Department will be reevaluated in 30 days, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “As for the timing, we will reevaluate and reassess and make further decisions after this 30-day period is up, but within these 30 days, our entire focus is making sure that this is the most efficient operation possible.” Any request of over 30 days must be passed into law. More than 20 people were arrested in Washington, DC, yesterday following the deployment of hundreds of officers and agents after President Donald Trump declared a crime emergency in the city, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “Approximately 850 officers and agents were surged across the city. Leavitt said people were arrested for “homicide, firearms offenses, possession with intent to distribute, narcotics, fare evasion, lewd acts, stalking, possession of a high capacity magazine …  driving under the influence, reckless driving and a bench warrant.” The press secretary said authorities also seized six illegal handguns as well. President Donald Trump is participating in virtual Ukraine talks tomorrow, a White House official told CNN. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said yesterday he was planning to host a virtual meeting with Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders to discuss the war in Ukraine. It comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. Pinto also voiced support for Mayor Muriel Bowser and DC Police Chief Pamela Smith during an interview on CNN, urging them to “make sure” that the administration's takeover of city resources “doesn't last longer than 30 days,” as outlined in the president's executive order. But I am also the first to say we have to do more — reality and safety have to be true for everyone in DC, and we take seriously our responsibility here that we're also the nation's capital,” Pinto said. Attorney General Pam Bondi released a statement on X following her meeting this morning with Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser. Bondi said in the statement that she and Bowser agreed to keep tourists and residents in the city safe from “deadly crime” and that they will continue to work closely together to carry out the president's orders. However, there is no additional clarity on leadership structure or missions of the federal intervention. “I just concluded a productive meeting with DC @MayorBowser at the Department of Justice. We agreed that there is nothing more important than keeping residents and tourists in Washington, D.C. safe from deadly crime. At President Trump's direction, @TheJusticeDept will work closely with D.C. city government and @DCPoliceDept to make Washington, D.C. safe again,” Bondi wrote. Bowser said that Bondi will be serving as President Donald Trump's proxy to implement his executive order. We have the best in the business in (the Metropolitan Police Department) in Chief Pamela Smith to lead that effort and to make sure that the men and women who are coming from federal law enforcement are being well used … all in an effort to drive down crime,” Bowser told reporters. Bowser also said that Attorney General Pam Bondi will be serving as Trump's proxy to implement his order. The president designated Attorney General Bondi as his proxy to request services through me,” Bowser said. Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith told reporters she met with Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terrance Cole and United States Marshals Service Director Gadyaces “Gady” Serralta yesterday and today to discuss President Donald Trump's order to take control of the city's police department. I think it's going to be a good effort. It's going to be an effort that's supported by both teams. Cole was tapped as interim federal commissioner of the DC Metropolitan Police Department. She said that the MPD has provided Cole with a “strategic plan on how we will provide resources around our city.” Asked who she responds to amid the federal takeover of DC police, Smith said: Additional Department of Justice officials attended the meeting with DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and Attorney General Pam Bondi. The South Korean leader's upcoming visit to Washington comes on the heels of a July trade deal in which the US agreed to reduce its reciprocal tariff on South Korean goods from a proposed 25% to 15%.</p>

Fox News correspondent Alexandria Hoff has the latest on how the Justice Department will run Washington, D.C.'s police force on 'Special Report.' A crowd rental company has seen a massive uptick in inquiries regarding its services in Washington, D.C., amid President Donald Trump's move to federalize the police force in the nation's capital. "Right now, D.C. inquiries are up roughly 400% compared to the same period in 2024," Crowds on Demand CEO Adam Swart told Fox News Digital, adding that the time period he is referencing is May to July 2024. The company always sees a spike in requests during what Swart calls "high-stakes political moments." Protesters march during a No Kings rally in Washington, D.C., June 14, 2025. (David Dee Delgado for Fox News Digital) "A large share are focused on opposing Trump's policies in Washington and raising alarms about government overreach," Swart said. Swart said the "vast majority" of people at political or advocacy events in D.C. are in some way paid. "Most people don't know this, but many protesters are literally on the payroll – Capitol Hill staffers from both parties are often expected to show up at rallies and protests on their own time," he said.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) On Monday, Trump announced that District of Columbia National Guard troops will be activated to patrol the streets in Washington, and that the federal government will take control of the Metropolitan Police Department. Trump cited unchecked violent crime as the reason for the takeover, which he announced a week after former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer Edward Coristine and his girlfriend were subject to an attempted carjacking on Aug. 3. Upon learning of Coristine's victimization, Trump first floated the idea in a post on his TRUTH Social platform. Demonstrators outside the U.S. Capitol ahead of a joint meeting of Congress with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on July 24, 2024. He said criminals in the city are not afraid of the police because "nothing ever happens to them." "The most recent victim was beaten mercilessly by local thugs," Trump wrote. "… Perhaps it should have been done a long time ago, then this incredible young man, and so many others, would not have had to go through the horrors of Violent Crime.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following a meeting with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Tuesday morning, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser emphasized that the Metropolitan Police Department will retain its independence, including over hiring and firing, saying “our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, none of that has changed.” The remarks marked a change in tone from Monday when Bowser called Trump's executive order “unsettling and unprecedented.” Leavitt says Trump's goal for his meeting with Putin this week is “to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war.” She described the meeting as “a listening exercise for the president” that he agreed to after Putin requested a meeting. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says approximately 850 federal law enforcement officers were deployed in Washington and made 23 arrests overnight. Leavitt says the arrests include charges of homicide, gun and drug crimes, reckless driving, fare evasion and drunken driving.Leavitt said six illegal handguns were seized. “This is only the beginning,” she said, pledging that federal authorities would continue policing in the nation's capital for a month. “President Trump will not be deterred by soft on crime democrats and media activists,” Leavitt said TO DESTROY YOUR ILLEGAL CROOKED MAPS IN RED STATES,” the post reads. The new maps in California would still need state lawmakers and voters approval. The Swiss Association of Precious Metals Manufacturers and Traders on Tuesday said it was awaiting a formal decision after Trump wrote “Gold will not be Tariffed!” on his Truth Social platform late Monday. “President Trump's statement is an encouraging signal for trade stability,” said Christoph Wild, the president of the association, which counts 15 companies that process and trade in precious metals like gold. The Swiss National Bank, citing figures from the Swiss government, in April issued a report saying that gold refineries in Switzerland supply about one-third of refined gold worldwide. Last year, gold accounted for some 27% of goods trade value from the country, making it Switzerland's most-traded product — ahead of pharmaceuticals at 22%, the SNB said. The precious metals association, known as ASFCMP, last week expressed concern following news reports and other indications that the Trump administration might apply whopping 39% U.S. tariffs on Swiss products -- among the highest it has imposed anywhere -- to gold products. Bowser also emphasized that the Metropolitan Police Department will retain its independence, including over hiring and firing, saying “our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, none of that has changed.” The remarks mark a change in tone from Monday when Bowser called Trump's executive order “unsettling and unprecedented.” Pamela Smith, chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, spoke about reduced crime in the city and said increased federal resources “will only help us build upon that.” Bondi called the meeting with Bowser “productive” in a statement on X, adding that the Justice Department will work closely with city government and police.

Chip Roy, R-Texas during a House Judiciary Committee Field Hearing, Monday, April 17, 2023, in New York. Last year, a federal court ordered Alabama to use a new congressional map, which put Moore's home outside his own district. Rather than moving to seek his old seat, he opted to challenge his fellow GOP incumbent in a hard-fought primary for the more solidly Republican 1st District. Now he's seeking the position being vacated by Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who's running for governor. The rare open Senate seat is expected to draw a number of candidates and Alabama's Republican attorney general has already entered the race. Dana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, speaks during a news conference following the UFC 313 mixed martial arts event Saturday, March 8, 2025, in Las Vegas. Hours after Paramount and UFC announced a billion-dollar rights deal, Dana White said he had yet to hear from his friend, President Trump, on his thoughts about the fight company's new streaming home. Trump said last month he wanted to stage a UFC match on the White House grounds with upwards of 20,000 spectators to celebrate 250 years of American independence. “It's absolutely going to happen,” White told The Associated Press. “Before and during litigation, the defendants obstructed routine drawdown requests on money already set aside in the Endowment's Treasury account, imposed and then abandoned a novel waiver requirement, and delayed the obligation of apportioned funds,” she wrote. Friedrich granted a preliminary injunction sought by the endowment for its remaining 2025 funding — $95 million, or about a third of its annual funding. Graduating George Washington University students holding a Palestinian flag gesture the peace sign as they walk out with other graduates in a pro-Palestinian protest during the commencement ceremony in Washington, Sunday, May 19, 2024. A Justice Department investigation concluded that leaders of George Washington University were “deliberately indifferent” to complaints of antisemitism stemming from pro-Palestinian protests last year. The tent encampment at George Washington lasted about two weeks starting in April 2024 before it was cleared by police. It's a closely watched appointment by the two-term governor, who can't run for reelection in 2026 and has been working to cement his legacy as his time leading the state winds down. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis gestures during a news conference Tuesday, Aug. 12, 2025, in Tampa, Fla. (AP Photo/Chris O'Meara) If Collins, an Army combat veteran and nonprofit executive, decides to launch a bid to succeed DeSantis, the move could tee up another proxy fight between the popular GOP governor and President Trump, who's already endorsed U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds for the job. During a Tuesday news conference announcing his pick, DeSantis praised Collins for having strong conservative principles. Collins was then sworn in minutes after the announcement. The seat had been vacant since February, when then-lieutenant governor Jeanette Nuñez was appointed to lead one of the state's public universities. Trump has disappointed allies in Europe by saying Ukraine will have to give up some Russian-held territory. He also said Russia must accept land swaps, although it was unclear what Putin might be expected to surrender. Trump said Monday he's “going to get everybody's ideas” before meeting with Putin. Mayor Muriel Bowser was seen exiting a black SUV in the Justice Department courtyard and walking into the building ahead of her meeting with Attorney General Pam Bondi. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be secretary of Health and Human Services, speaks during a meeting with Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, Jan. 9, 2025. The White House is holding off on publicly releasing the much-anticipated “MAHA” strategy report that's supposed to provide a policy road map for making Americans healthier. The policy recommendations are a follow up from the MAHA report released in May, which focused on ultraprocessed foods, prescription drugs, vaccines, screentime and pesticides. The initial report had already divided some conservatives, with farmers concerned about its focus on pesticides and some from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s coalition upset that the report didn't call for a ban on those chemicals. Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith was also seen entering Justice Department headquarters ahead of the planned meeting. Trump said Monday that Bondi would assume responsibility for the police department in the hopes of reducing crime, even as city officials stressed crime is already falling. Trump called Fed chair Jerome Powell a “loser” Tuesday and demanded that he cut the central bank's short-term interest rate. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell speaks at the DealBook Summit in New York, Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. Trump also said he might allow a “major lawsuit” to proceed against the Fed over the burgeoning cost of its massive renovation of two office buildings, currently expected to cost $2.5 billion, up from a previous estimate of $1.9 billion. It's not clear what lawsuit Trump was referring to. It was unclear whether even Ukraine will take part in the summit. Trump has said he wants to see whether Russian leader Vladimir Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year. Trump has disappointed allies in Europe by saying Ukraine will have to give up some Russian-held territory. He also said Russia must accept land swaps, although it was unclear what Putin might be expected to surrender. It comes after data suggested inflation across the country was a touch better last month than economists expected. The S&P 500 rose 0.6% and was on track to top its all-time high set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 251 points, or 0.6%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was 0.7% higher and also heading toward a record. Stocks got a lift from hopes that the better-than-expected inflation report will give the Federal Reserve more leeway to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September. President Trump has angrily been calling for cuts to help the economy, often insulting the Fed's chair personally while doing so. Jones' push for a bill allowing a hospital to be built in his home county is complicating end-of-session negotiations among Georgia lawmakers. Trump announced the nod Monday, noting Jones was among the first Georgia Republicans to endorse Trump's first bid for the White House in 2016 and saying Jones “worked tirelessly to help us win” in all three of Trump's bids. “He has been with us from the very beginning,” Trump wrote on social media. Brian Kemp, who can't run again because of term limits. Other Republican candidates who could enter the race include Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. National Guard troops are beginning to arrive at the Washington, D.C., armory. Trump said Monday that in hopes of reducing crime, he would be taking over Washington's police department and activating 800 members of the National Guard. “Tremendous work is being done, and money being spent, on bringing it back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment,” he said, without offering details. Trump spurned the performing arts center in his first term after some honorees refused to attend a traditional White House event recognizing their achievements to protest Trump's policies, including those toward the arts. There is nothing on the president's public schedule today. However, press secretary Karoline Leavitt will hold a briefing at 1 p.m. Here's a look at what the law says about Trump's actions: His authority is less clear in Los Angeles, where a legal battle continues over his recent deployment of the National Guard despite the objections of Gov. Section 740 of the Home Rule Act allows for the president to take over Washington's Metropolitan Police Department for 48 hours, with possible extensions to 30 days, during times of emergencies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday that President Trump's announcement of his takeover of D.C. police force were “unsettling” but not without precedent. Attorney General Pam Bondi, meanwhile, called the Tuesday morning meeting productive in a social media post and said the Justice Department would “work closely with the D.C. city government” to “make Washington, D.C., safe again.” While Trump invokes his plan by saying that “we're going to take our capital back,” Bowser and the MPD maintain that violent crime overall in Washington has decreased to a 30-year low after a sharp rise in 2023. Carjackings, for example, dropped about 50% in 2024 and are down again this year. Bowser, a Democrat, spent much of Trump's first term in office openly sparring with the Republican president. She fended off his initial plans for a military parade through the streets and stood in public opposition when he called in a multi-agency flood of federal law enforcement to confront anti-police brutality protesters in summer 2020. In Trump's second term, backed by Republican control of both houses of Congress, Bowser has walked a public tightrope for months, emphasizing common ground with the Trump administration on issues such as the successful effort to bring the NFL's Washington Commanders back to the District of Columbia. She watched with open concern for the city streets as Trump finally got his military parade this summer. Her decision to dismantle Black Lives Matter Plaza earlier this year served as a neat metaphor for just how much the power dynamics between the two executives had evolved. Now that fraught relationship enters uncharted territory as Trump has followed through on months of what many D.C. officials had quietly hoped were empty threats. The new standoff has cast Bowser in a sympathetic light, even among her longtime critics. “It's a power play and we're an easy target,” said Clinique Chapman, CEO of the D.C. Justice Lab. Bowser contends that all the power resides with Trump and that her administration can do little other than comply and make the best of it. As long as Washington remains a federal enclave with limited autonomy under the 1973 Home Rule Act, she said, it will remain vulnerable to such takeovers. “We know that access to our democracy is tenuous,” Bowser said. “That is why you have heard me, and many many Washingtonians before me, advocate for full statehood for the District of Columbia.” Section 740 of the Home Rule Act allows the president to take over Washington's police for up to 30 days during times of emergencies. No president has done so before, said Monica Hopkins, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union's D.C. chapter. “That should alarm everyone,” she said, “not just in Washington.” For Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects an escalation of his aggressive approach to law enforcement. The District of Columbia's status as a congressionally established federal district gives him a unique opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime. “Let me be crystal clear,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said during Trump's announcement news conference. Federal law enforcement officers patrol The Wharf, Monday, Aug. 11, 2025, in Washington. He has declared states of emergency on issues ranging from border protection to economic tariffs, enabling him to essentially rule via executive order. In many cases, he has moved forward while the courts sorted them out. Bowser's claims about successfully driving down violent crime rates received backing earlier this year from an unlikely source. Ed Martin, Trump's original choice for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, issued a press release in April hailing a 25% drop in violent crime rates from the previous year. Safe Again' initiative, the District has seen a significant decline in violent crime,” Martin said. “We are proving that strong enforcement, and smart policies can make our communities safer.” Associated Press writer Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this report from Washington.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? ﻿The question is whether a Republican judiciary will read the entire law governing Trump's power over DC, or just the part that Trump likes. On Monday, President Donald Trump released an executive order invoking a rarely used federal law that allows him to temporarily seize control over Washington, DC's police force. Later the same day, DC's Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser seemed to concede that there's nothing she can do about it. “We could contest that, but the authority is pretty broad.” Bowser is almost certainly correct that Trump can seize control of her city's police force, at least for a little while. The District of Columbia is not a state, and does not enjoy the same control over its internal affairs that, say, nearby Virginia or Maryland does. If Congress wanted to, it could turn DC into a federal protectorate tomorrow. The same law, however, also provides that presidential control over DC police must terminate after 30 days, unless Congress takes some action to extend it. So, assuming that the courts actually apply this 30-day limit to Trump, Trump's control over DC's local police will only last a month at most. Indeed, Trump's own executive order seems to acknowledge that his powers are time-limited. It provides that, absent congressional action, “no such services made available pursuant to the direction of the President … shall extend for any period in excess of 30 days.” So, if Trump does try to extend the time limit without Congress's consent, the courts should not permit him to do so. His DC police order is just the latest of these emergency declarations. As pretty much everyone who has written about Monday's executive order has noted, violent crime rates in the city are at a 30-year low. A persistent problem is the opposite of an emergency. That said, Bowser is correct that the Home Rule Act's text permits the president, and the president alone, to determine whether an emergency exists that justifies taking control of DC's police. The very nature of an emergency is that it is a sudden event that requires immediate action, without which matters could deteriorate rapidly. Suppose, for example, that a violent mob attacks the US Capitol during an important national event, such as the congressional certification of a presidential election. When Congress enacted the Home Rule Act, it quite sensibly could have thought that the president should be able to draw upon all nearby law enforcement officers to quell such an attack on the United States — without having to first seek permission from local elected officials, or a judge. Congress, of course, did not anticipate that the president might be complicit in such an attack. A nation as large and diverse as the United States cannot function unless its chief executive has the power to take some unilateral actions. It's worth noting that not every emergency statute is worded as permissively as the Home Rule Act's provision governing local police. In May, for example, a federal court struck down many of the ever-shifting tariffs that Trump imposed during his time back in office. One of the plaintiffs' primary arguments in that case, known as V.O.S. Trump primarily relied on a statute known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to justify his tariffs. That law gives him fairly broad authority to “regulate” international transactions, but this power “may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared.” One is that there must be an emergency declaration, but the other is that the president must invoke IEEPA to deal with an actual “unusual and extraordinary threat.” Trump claims that many of his tariffs are justified because of trade deficits — the United States buys more goods from many nations than it sells — but the US has had trade deficits for at least two decades. So trade deficits are hardly an “unusual and extraordinary threat.” But the question of whether any particular invocation may plausibly be challenged in court will turn on the specific wording of individual statutes. All of this said, the Home Rule Act does contain one very significant limit on presidential power: the 30-day limit. And the statute is quite clear that this limit should not be evaded. Again, it states that “no” services made available to the president “shall extend for any period in excess of 30 days, unless the Senate and the House of Representatives enact into law a joint resolution authorizing such an extension.” (The law also permits Congress to extend this 30-day limit by adjourning “sine die,” meaning that Congress adjourns without formally setting a date for its return, something it typically only does for a brief period every year.) So what happens if, a month from now, Trump declares a new emergency and tries to seize control of DC's police for another 30 days? If the courts conclude that he can do that, they would make a mockery of the Home Rule Act's text. Presidents should not be allowed to wave away an explicit statutory limit on their authority by photocopying an old executive order and changing the dates. So, while the Home Rule Act is very clear about the 30-day limit on Trump's power, there is no guarantee that this Supreme Court will rule that the law applies to him. There's a method to his trade war madness. The most surprising consequence of Trump's trade war. Wall Street may be reeling, but it's poor and working-class people who'll be hurt by the Trump's trade war.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, speaks during a news conference following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Wednesday, July 30, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. inflation was unchanged in July as rising prices for some imported goods were balanced by falling gas and grocery prices, leaving overall prices modestly higher than a year ago. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 3.1%, up from 2.9% in June. Both figures are above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The new numbers suggest that slowing rent increases and cheaper gas are offsetting some impacts of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. Brian Bethune, an economist at Boston College, said that overall U.S. tariffs — calculated as the amount of duties paid by U.S. companies divided by overall imports — has reached 10%, the highest in decades, and will likely keep rising for months. “Those cost increases will be passed on to the consumer in some way, shape, or form,” Bethune said. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, speaks during a news conference following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Wednesday, July 30, 2025, in Washington. And companies that are absorbing tariff costs, which would cut into their profit margins, are less likely to hire new employees, he said. The Federal Reserve may now be in a difficult spot. A rate cut by the Fed often, but not always, lowers borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and business loans. Some argued that the worsening jobs picture will outweigh lingering inflation concerns and lead the Fed to cut at its next meeting in September. Chair Jerome Powell has warned that worsening inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines — a stance that has enraged Trump, who has defied traditional norms of central bank independence and demanded lower borrowing costs. On Tuesday, Trump attacked Powell again for not cutting rates and suggested he would allow a lawsuit against the Fed to proceed because of the rising costs of its extensive building renovation. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell walks off after speaking during a news conference following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Wednesday, July 30, 2025, in Washington. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2% in July, down from 0.3% the previous month, while core prices ticked up 0.3%, a bit faster than the 0.2% in June. Grocery prices slipped 0.1% last month, though they are still 2.2% higher than a year ago. Tariffs appeared to raise the cost of some imported items: Shoe prices jumped 1.4% from June to July, though they are still just 0.9% more expensive than a year ago. The cost of furniture leapt 0.9% in July and is 3.2% higher than a year earlier. Coffee costs nearly 15% more than a year earlier, mostly because of troubled harvests overseas, though steep duties on imports from Brazil could push those prices higher in the coming months. Tuesday's data arrives at a highly-charged moment for the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects and publishes the inflation data. Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, then the head of BLS, after the Aug. 1 jobs report also showed sharply lower hiring for May and June than had previously been reported. The president posted on social media Monday that he has picked E.J. Antoni, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and a frequent critic of the jobs report, to replace McEntarfer. Adding to the turmoil at BLS is a government hiring freeze that has forced it to cut back on the data it collects for each inflation report, the agency has said. UBS economist Alan Detmeister estimates that BLS is now collecting about 18% fewer price quotes for the inflation report than it did earlier this year. He thinks the report will produce more volatile results, though averaged out over time, still reliable. Smaller companies are trying to avoid raising prices and some have turned to novel ways of raising funds. Clothing maker Princess Awesome, which designs matching clothes for children and adults, has seen its costs jump 15% to 20% because of the tariffs. For now, the company has instituted a “tip jar” on its website where it asks customers to help defray the cost of goods. Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that foreign manufacturers have absorbed just 14% of the duties through June, while 22% has been paid by consumers and 64% by U.S. companies. Yet the economists expect that by this fall consumers will bear two-thirds of the burden, while foreign exporters pay a quarter and U.S. companies handle less than a tenth. Many large corporations are raising prices, including apparel makers Ralph Lauren and Under Armour, and eyewear company Warby Parker. Most of those increases weren't in place for Tuesday's inflation report. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said late last month that it would lift prices in August on about a quarter of its products by mid-single-digit percentages. Beauty, which makes a majority of its products in China, said on Wednesday that it had raised prices by a dollar on its entire product assortment as of Aug. 1 because of tariff costs, the third price hike in its 21-year history.

Shohei Ohtani and his agent were hit with a lawsuit by a real estate investor and broker in Hawaii, claiming they got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development by using their celebrity status. The Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way superstar's agent is accused of increasingly demanding concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto and then demanding that their own business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal. "[Nez] Balelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani's promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs' role in the project – for no reason other than their own financial self-interest," the lawsuit said, via the Associated Press. "This case is about abuse of power," the lawsuit continued. "Defendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built. "Defendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Ohtani and Balelo are accused of tortious interference and unjust enrichment, while also undermining their interests in another venture. Los Angeles' two-way player Shohei Ohtani bats against the Toronto Blue Jays at Dodger Stadium. Balelo threatened to pull Ohtani from the deal if their own demands weren't met, the suit said. "Kingsbarn began capitulating to Balelo's every whim," the suit said. Ohtani signed his endorsement deal with the developers in 2023. This is not the first time Ohtani has had off-field drama involving large sums of money. His former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, is serving a prison sentence for theft and fraud after stealing money from Ohtani to pay off gambling debts. The money delivered to bookies was from Ohtani's bank account. Los Angeles Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani celebrates with teammates after hitting a home run against the Los Angeles Angels at Angel Stadium. Ohtani just became the first person since 2018 to hit 40-plus home runs in three consecutive seasons, as he vies for a fourth MVP in the last five years for the NL West-leading Dodgers.

A CNN panel suggested Monday that the "look at the statistics" response from some national Democrats on President Trump's crime plan might come across as "tone-deaf." "What's striking is that national Democrats are not following Mayor Bowser‘s lead on this, and that national Democrats have been insisting, ‘Just look at the statistics, we have a 30-year low in violent crime.' Whereas Mayor Bowser is talking about, ‘Hey, we need to get 500 more police officers on the streets. We'd like the federal government to help us rebuild our jail,'" Axios reporter Alex Thompson said during a discussion on "The Arena with Kasie Hunt." "She's also talking about some of the reforms she did to make it so accused violent offenders don‘t get out of jail pretrial. So there is this disconnect, and I've talked to Democrat strategists today that think that national Democrats saying, ‘look at the statistics,' is sort of a tone-deaf way to react," Thompson continued. Trump spoke to reporters on Monday about his plan, which was immediately dismissed by top Democrats, who argued that crime is at a 30-year low. A CNN panel on Monday suggested the "look at the statistics" response to President Trump's plan to combat crime in DC might sound tone deaf. Kristen Soltis Anderson, a CNN political commentator, pointed out that the Democratic Party's reliance on crime statistics mirrored its unsuccessful economic messaging during Joe Biden's presidency. "Isn't this the exact same problem that Democrats had last year? That feels like a lot of this conversation around crime that you can point to statistics all day long that say, ‘Hey, D.C. is safer this year than it was last year,' but do people feel safe?" "Bottom line, if they don't, they may be more okay with something that would otherwise be considered extraordinary," Anderson said. US President Donald Trump, alongside Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (L) and Attorney General Pam Bondi (R), speaks during a news conference to discuss crime in Washington, DC, in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, DC, on August 11, 2025. Former Republican lawmaker Peter Meijer chimed in, saying Mayor Muriel Bowser might know something about the possible manipulation of statistics at the D.C. police department. "She may know some things that national Democrats are not paying attention to," Meijer said. "It is also true, crime is one of these things where the randomness of it actually has a big psychological effect, right?" said Jamal Simmons, a former communications director for Kamala Harris. "When random crime happens along 14th street or one of the big thoroughfares here in the district, people get very animated about it." CNN host Kasie Hunt also pointed out that a D.C. murder victim Trump referenced during the press conference on Monday, former Trump administration official Mike Gill, who was killed during a carjacking in 2024, was one of her neighbors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Philippine official said Chinese coast guard ships chased and staged dangerous blocking maneuvers on Monday against the Philippine coast guard and fishing vessels in the Scarborough Shoal. In this photo, taken from video and provided by the Philippine Coast Guard, a damaged Chinese Coast Guard ship, right, is seen beside a Chinese Navy vessel, left, after they accidentally collided while chasing a Philippine fisheries boat near Scarborough Shoal in the disputed South China Sea on Monday Aug. 11, 2025.

In this photo, taken from video and provided by the Philippine Coast Guard, a damaged Chinese Coast Guard ship is seen after accidentally colliding with a Chinese Navy vessel while chasing a Philippine fisheries boat near Scarborough Shoal in the disputed South China Sea on Monday Aug. 11, 2025. Philippine authorities said Monday's accidental collision resulted in visibly heavy damages to the Chinese coast guard and navy ships and possible injuries. It did not mention the collision or possible casualties. Video footage made public by the Philippine coast guard shows a Chinese navy ship with the bow number 164 slamming into the bow of a Chinese coast guard ship while both try to block and force a Philippine patrol ship, the BRP Suluan, away from Scarborough. The Chinese coast guard ship can be seen using its water cannon. The Chinese navy ship sustained deep dents and what appeared to be linear cuts on its hull. BRP Suluan offered medical help by two-way radio to the Chinese coast guard, fearing the collision may have caused injuries to its personnel, but the Philippine coast guard said it received no response. Gan Yu, a spokesperson for the Chinese coast guard in Beijing, said Monday that the Philippine vessels intruded into Chinese territorial waters off the shoal, prompting its forces to take “necessary measures, including monitoring, forcing, intercepting and controlling the Philippine vessels to expel them.” “China's aggressive actions were very clear in this incident,” Brawner said. “They were at fault because of their aggressive maneuvers. We were there to protect Filipino fishermen in the Scarborough Shoal. He said the Philippine military would assess how to respond in consultation with the coast guard and would seek guidance from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. “Now they are deploying their PLA navy, and this is one symbol of China's aggressiveness,” he said, referring to China's People's Liberation Army. Chinese officials did not immediately comment on Brawner's statement but Gan Yu insisted its forces would be “resolutely safeguarding China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.” Associated Press journalist Huizhong Wu contributed to this report.</p>

Gavin Newsom's response to Texas' redistricting plan on ‘Fox News Live.' Former NBC host Chuck Todd argued that America is heading towards a "cold civil war" on "The Chuck Toddcast" on Tuesday as redistricting battles in states like Texas and California continue to rage. Todd contended that the ongoing redistricting battles are "just the latest skirmish between what is turning into a cold civil war," and that it is President Donald Trump and the Republican Party who are "creating this unprecedented challenge to our constitutional republic." I hate using those words, but what else are you going to describe it? We are literally having a redistricting war between the states right now, and we have governors who have decided they don't care about the minority rights in their own states," Todd argued. If you don't agree with Greg Abbott, he is going to force his will upon you in the state of Texas. And if you don't agree with Gavin Newsom and how they're going — he's going to force his will upon you," he added. Chuck Todd criticized both Democrats and Republicans for their roles in helping foment what he called a "cold civil war," but focused in on Trump and the Republican Party as the primary catalysts to the situation. The former NBC host stated that "this is not what the founders intended," placing blame on both sides of the aisle, but focusing in on Trump as the primary catalyst for what he describes as a "cold civil war." This isn't the usual partisan back and forth. It is a direct stress test of whether our constitutional system actually works when a president and his party decide they don't have to care about the limits that are written down on paper," he asserted. While Todd criticized the Trump administration's use of federal power and Texas Governor Greg Abbott's redistricting efforts, he also took issue with the Democrats' 'fight fire with fire' approach to these perceived problems. "The Democratic response is pretty troubling because, right now as a party, okay, as an official party apparatus, they've decided to frame this moment as a war, right? Todd called on congressional Republicans to "check" Trumps power. Todd noted that Democrats have championed independent commissions and wanted competitive district mapping for years, but now with Republicans "openly wanting to break the rules like they're doing in Texas," Democrats are also looking to "break the rules" with their own redistricting efforts. "Au contraire, my friend, I do God – understand the stakes, and we are not replacing one unprincipled, unconstitutional set of leaders with another set of unprincipled, unconstitutional set of leaders." In closing, Todd called on Republican members of Congress to "check" Trump's power and use the tools afforded to them by the Constitution to hold him accountable for the "unconstitutional" actions he has taken while in office. "They've not lifted one finger of oversight. Not one… You couldn't even say there've been a weak check on Trump. It has been no check on him at all," he asserted. The Constitution can't enforce itself without people willing to wield those checks. All we have are words on yellowing parchment paper."

It probably has nothing to do with saving birds. The Trump administration is worried, it would seem, about eagles — like, the big birds of prey with sharp talons and famously good eyesight. Earlier this month, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who oversees endangered species, wrote on X that wind-energy projects kill eagles, including the iconic bald eagle, and his agency would work to protect them from harm. He even appended a memo to the post that directs the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which falls under Burgum's command, to enforce an existing law called the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act to make sure that these birds are not “sacrificed” for wind power. The law makes killing or harming eagles without a government permit illegal. One possible interpretation is that Burgum simply cares about birds. Or the bald eagle, anyway, a national symbol. That apparently includes suddenly caring about certain wildlife regulations. Accurate estimates are hard to come by, though it's reasonable to assume that turbine blades kill hundreds of eagles per year nationwide. That number is somewhere around 1 million birds per year if you account for all avian species, according to data scientist Hannah Ritchie. That being said, a much bigger threat to birds is stray cats, buildings, and cars. Climate change — the very problem that wind energy is helping fix. A landmark 2019 report by the National Audubon Society, a nonprofit bird conservation group, found that rising temperatures put nearly two-thirds of North American bird species at an elevated risk of extinction, including golden eagles. Finally, there's this: Although bald eagles were once on the brink of extinction, these birds are doing just fine now. That doesn't include Alaska — home to the largest bald eagle population in the US — where some people consider them pests because they're so abundant. Bald eagles don't need saving from Trump officials. The many species that do, meanwhile, are losing protections because of policy decisions by those very same officials. So far, the Trump administration has moved to limit the scope of laws meant to safeguard migratory birds, including eagles, and all federally endangered species, seemingly to loosen restrictions on the oil and gas industry. Separately, in May, the administration took steps to undo federal protections for the lesser prairie-chicken, an imperiled ground bird in Texas that lives atop oil-rich lands. It's also planning to open up eagle-filled wilderness in Alaska to drilling, cut funding for a bird-monitoring program, and log more US forests, which are famously where birds live. Ironically, it's the policies and programs that Trump officials are now eroding that helped save bald eagles in the first place. So if the administration was serious about helping eagles — or the hundreds of other American bird species, from hummingbirds to owls — it's pretty clear that its actions would look a lot different. Inside the years-long quest to catch a sea star killer. These (literal) thirst traps are helping wild animals beat the heat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump nominated Heritage Foundation economist E.J. Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics. His nomination comes shortly after Trump fired former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, a Biden appointee who published an unfavorable job report. He included an implicit slight against McEntarfer in his announcement on Truth Social. Antoni will do an incredible job in this new role. The BLS's July jobs report revealed that some 258,000 fewer jobs were added in May and June than previously reported, meaning the three-month moving average of job gains was just 35,000 in July, below the level needed to keep pace with population growth. Trump claimed the numbers were “rigged” and accused McEntarfer of inflating the job numbers of former President Joe Biden before the November election. Trump's move drew widespread criticism, but Antoni was a vocal defender. Speaking with the Washington Examiner on Aug. 5, he said he was only surprised that such a move had taken so long.“Just the timing is very unfortunate because it makes it look like you're just firing the person because you weren't happy with the numbers as opposed to firing for incompetence, which I think has been the case for a couple of years now,” Antoni said. Though he disagreed with Trump's allegation of “shenanigans,” Antoni said he did believe previous job reports were faulty due to “general incompetence.” Antoni pointed to the low survey response as illustrating McEntarfer's poor performance in the role. Antoni was previously critical of the BLS and contributed to the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025.</p>
