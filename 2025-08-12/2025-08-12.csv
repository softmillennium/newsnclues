            Spanish search and rescue teams have found the body of an American hiker who went missing in the Pyrenees last month.
    


            The body of Cole Henderson, 27, was located on the north face of Monte Perdido, the third-highest peak in the Pyrenees, Spain's Guardia Civil confirmed to CNN in an emailed statement on Tuesday.
    


            Authorities said the place where Henderson was found on Friday afternoon was a difficult area to access, with the specialist teams using a crane to airlift his body.
    


            On July 9, Henderson told friends he was going to hike into the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park in the province of Huesca. One of his last communications was a text to a friend saying he'd parked up and was putting his phone on airplane mode before starting his trek.
    


            He was reported missing and a search began on July 14 after failing to take his flight home to the Netherlands two days prior.
    


            Specialist mountain rescue teams and helicopters from the Air Service were deployed to assist in the search, the Guardia Civil previously told CNN.
    


            Authorities had been working on the theory that Henderson may have tried to climb Monte Perdido, which stands at 3,355 meters (11,007 feet) high.
    


            The route is rated as “Peu Difficile” (PD), meaning “somewhat difficult” by the climbing community. While PD routes are often climbed without ropes, they might involve steep sections of climbing, or crevassed glaciers, and frequently require specialized equipment, such as ice axes or crampons.
    


            The typical route from the town of Torla, where Henderson's car was located, was still covered in snow in early July, according to footage posted on social media.

Israel could have wiped out Gaza's population within hours if it had intended to commit genocide, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed, while denying that his government is pursuing a pre-mediated policy of starvation in the Palestinian enclave.

Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Netanyahu scrambled to defend himself against heavy international criticism of Israel's campaign in Gaza, which many view as a deliberate attempt to starve the enclave into submission.

He insisted that there “hasn't been starvation” in the area, describing the situation instead as a temporary “shortage.”

“If we had wanted starvation, if that had been our policy, two million Gazans wouldn't be living today after 20 months… If we had wanted to commit genocide, it would have taken exactly one afternoon,” he said.

From early March until May, Israel imposed a complete ban on the entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Although Netanyahu said that the restrictions have since been lifted, the UN insists that supply convoys to the enclave are frequently obstructed or looted.

In late July, UN agencies reported “mounting evidence” of famine in Gaza, with images of emaciated children circulating in the media.

According to Gaza's Health Ministry, more than 200 people, including 98 children, have died from malnutrition. In May, a total of 470,000 people were estimated to face “catastrophic hunger,” according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC).

Israel has come under a barrage of international criticism in recent months, with several Western countries announcing plans to recognize the state of Palestine. Moreover, last week NBC News reported that US President Donald Trump had shouted at Netanyahu during a recent phone call after the prime minister attempted to downplay reports of starvation in Gaza.

Last week, Israel approved Netanyahu's plan to seize Gaza City, with the prime minister insisting it was the only way to secure the release of hostages still held in the enclave as well as its demilitarization. His remarks, however, have resulted in Israeli protests, with thousands taking to the streets across the country.

A “massive” swarm of jellyfish has triggered the shutdown of a nuclear power plant in northern France, the operator of the facility said on Monday.

The bloom of marine creatures clogged cooling systems filters at the plant at Gravelines, according to energy group EDF. The “massive and unpredictable presence of jellyfish” prompted four of the facility's power units to automatically shut off. The entire plant was put offline, as two other units were already inoperable due to maintenance. 

The incident, which occurred late on Sunday, had “no impact on the safety of the facilities, the safety of personnel, or the environment,” EDF said, adding that the gelatinous creatures made it only to “the non-nuclear part of the facilities.” 

“The plant teams are mobilized and are currently carrying out the necessary diagnostics and interventions to be able to restart the production units safely,” the energy group added. 

The nuclear site draws cooling water from a channel linking it to the North Sea, which is home to several jellyfish species. The plant operator did not elaborate on the type of jellyfish involved in the incident. 

There are multiple cases of jellyfish getting sucked into cooling systems or clogging up intake pipes of nuclear and conventional energy facilities worldwide. 

The Gravelines power plant is one of the largest nuclear sites in France, a country which gets 70% of its electricity from nuclear installations. Six of the facility's units have a peak production of 900 megawatts each, making the station alone capable of powering an estimated 5 million homes.

The entourage of Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky transfers $50 million every month to bank accounts belonging to two companies based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the Turkish newspaper Aydınlık reported on Monday. The funneled money was reportedly obtained through corruption.

Graft has remained one of the most pressing challenges facing Ukraine. Brussels has repeatedly suggested adopting stronger anti-corruption measures as a precondition for EU membership.

According to the publication, the tens of millions are reportedly transferred to the accounts of GFM Investment Group and Gmyrin Family Holding. The companies are said to be linked to a former advisor to the Ukraine State Property Fund, Andrey Gmyrin, who allegedly manages the money.

Gmyrin, who is currently under an international arrest warrant in connection with alleged corruption schemes causing “significant damage to the state budget,” was reportedly arrested in France last year on charges related to money laundering and stolen assets.

The publication does not provide any official comments from the Ukrainian authorities.

Separately, Ukrainian legislator Aleksey Goncharenko alleged on Monday that members of Zelensky's circle had attempted to launder approximately €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in cryptocurrency through the acquisition of a French bank that was ultimately blocked by local regulators.

The claim posted on the lawmaker's Telegram channel is based on alleged hidden recordings reportedly seized by Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), which has recently found itself at the center of Zelensky's controversial crackdown on anti-graft institutions.

The Ukrainian leader has faced growing criticism following his attempt to strip NABU and the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO) of their independence, citing Russian influence. Critics argue that these accusations served as a pretext to dismantle institutions investigating high-level graft, some of which implicated members of Zelensky's inner circle.

The move sparked widespread domestic protests and drew sharp warnings from Brussels, which has linked anti-corruption reforms to accession talks, ultimately forcing Zelensky to backtrack and introduce a new version of the bill.

Public trust in Zelensky has fallen sharply following his failed attempt to weaken anti-corruption agencies. Pollsters say that widespread corruption, more than any other issue, has eroded citizens' confidence in his leadership.

MOSCOW, August 12. /TASS/. The reliable construction of Russia's Su-34M fighter bomber allows the aircraft and its crew to emerge unscathed from belly landing, the Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper reported.

""The reliability of this aircraft has already become a legend. This spring, the Russian fourth-generation fighter-bomber successfully landed on its belly, with its wheels up. Notably, the crew and the aircraft were unscathed,"" the newspaper wrote.

The emergency situation occurred when the chassis and the nose wheel failed to deploy. Under these circumstances, pilots are allowed to eject. However, the crew asked the permission to perform a belly landing and thus save the aircraft.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, August 12. /TASS/. Europe's leaders are painting a picture of a Russian ""enemy"" to offload responsibility for the severe socio-economic crisis facing their countries, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Expert magazine in an interview.

""To justify aggression and divert societal frustration against Russia, a complex campaign of defamation has been launched - fueled by constant provocations, falsehoods, and outright lies. In the midst of a profound socio-economic crisis, today's European leaders are seemingly in desperate need of an ‘enemy' to blame for their failures and troubles,"" she explained.

Zakharova further asserted that Euro-Atlantic capitals remain committed to achieving a ""strategic defeat"" of Russia, willing to go to any lengths to realize this objective. ""The West has fostered and supported the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev, fixated on eradicating everything Russian. Despite failed blitzkrieg strategies, sanctions, and efforts to arm Kiev's regime, these measures have not shifted the realities on the frontlines,"" she said.

She also highlighted ongoing efforts to implant an ""anti-Russian, Russophobic worldview"" globally. ""It's important to recognize that these efforts are centuries old - from 19th-century newspapers and press to 20th-century anti-Soviet propaganda and Hollywood films, and now to the orchestrated campaigns and provocations of the modern era.

MOSCOW, August 12. /TASS/. European leaders will very quickly turn away from Vladimir Zelensky and try to improve relations with Russia, First Deputy Chairman of Russia's Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Vladimir Dzhabarov said on Thursday.

The senator noted that at the moment European leaders are trying to prove that they are ""presenting a united front"" with Zelensky but the situation may change. ""I think they will very quickly turn away from Zelensky when the time comes, and will just as quickly try to run even ahead of [U.S. President Donald] Trump in an attempt to establish some sort of relations with us,"" he told the Rossiya-24 TV channel.

Dzhabarov also commented on the upcoming meeting between Russian and US Presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump on August 15, suggesting that, in addition to the Ukrainian issue, the two heads of state will discuss economic matters and the restoration of diplomatic relations. ""Obviously, this will not happen in a single meeting – it will take time, and most importantly, patience from both sides,"" he added.

Dzhabarov stressed that bargaining over the lawful territories of the Russian Federation will be out of place when it comes to resolving the Ukrainian conflict. ""I mean all four new regions, as well as Crimea, which has long been part of Russia. These are our constitutional lands, our constitutional territories, and no one will bargain over this issue with the Americans, let alone the Ukrainians,"" the senator concluded.

Trump said on August 8 that he hopes to hold a meeting with Putin in Alaska on August 15.

Fake heiress denies responsibility as social media users accuse her of mistreating the three bunnies

After years of prison and conniving her way into luxury, Anna Sorokin has New York talking about her again.

This time, it is not posing as a German heiress or being jailed for four years, instead the convicted fraudster has been left “disturbed” and “horrified” after three rabbits used in her photoshoot were found dumped in a nearby park.

Sorokin, who also went by the name Anna Delvey and is the subject of Netflix's Inventing Anna, shot to infamy after a high-profile court case. The fraudster, who masqueraded as an heiress, swindled the wealthy in Manhattan with an invented trust fund.

But this latest saga involves a photograph on her Instagram account, in which she is pictured outside a Tribeca subway station with a black ankle monitor – stipulated under the terms of her 2022 prison release – and holding two leashed rabbits.

Days after posing for the photographs, social media users were quick to link the abandoned bunnies with Sorokin after the animals were spotted in Prospect Park in Brooklyn.

“I felt ashamed and embarrassed to be associated with it,” Sorokin said of the affair. The 34-year-old said she was not responsible for the rabbits and was “horrified” to learn they had been dumped.

The first bunny, a one-and-a-half-year-old Harlequin lop, was found in the bushes by Terry Chao near a cardboard box used as part of Sorokin's photoshoot last week. On Thursday, another rabbit was found near the same cardboard box, followed by a third on Sunday, near a black carrier bag, she told the New York Times.

The man who photographed Sorokin, Jasper Egan Soloff, told the newspaper through a lawyer that it was not his shoot and claimed to have no knowledge of how the animals were obtained or handled.

Another person involved in the shoot appears to have apologised and taken responsibility in a since-deleted Instagram post.

“When I realised the rabbits were being surrendered to me I panicked. At 19, with no experience caring for animals, no pet-friendly housing, and no knowledge of available resources, I felt overwhelmed and made the worst possible choice,” he reportedly wrote.

“Believing, mistakenly, that there were existing rabbits in that area, I released them there, thinking that was my best option.”

He added that they were being fostered by someone in New York, while Sorokin said she offered to help rehome the rabbits when she learned they had been abandoned.

People on social media have accused Sorokin of animal cruelty. Many commenters decried her use of the animals as props, and warned against photographing bunnies on leashes on their backs, a position known as trancing that can be harmful to the animals.

“I do not eat meat, and I had no involvement in the acquisition, transport, or return of these animals. I would never condone these actions,” Sorokin told the website Page Six. After being convicted in 2019 on multiple counts of larceny and theft, she was released after nearly four years in jail and a further 18 months in immigration detention for overstaying her visa, and was told to refrain from posting on social media.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Message comes after Texas Democratic lawmakers stymied another GOP effort to gain more seats at president's behest

Texas Democrats once again stymied a Republican effort to redraw the state's congressional maps at the behest of Donald Trump, and Gavin Newsom, the California governor, urged the president to stand down and defuse the redistricting arms race that has spread across the country.

Enough Texas Democrats remained outside of the state on Monday to deny the Republican-led state legislature the quorum necessary to proceed with Trump's desired congressional map. Dozens of Democratic state lawmakers left the state on Sunday, taking refuge in blue states such as Illinois and New York. They have spent the last week working to raise awareness and rally support for their efforts to block the Republican redistricting plan.

The standoff has widened the redistricting wars, with Newsom and other Democratic state leaders threatening to draw retaliatory maps if Texas moves ahead with its redistricting scheme.

In a letter to Trump on Monday, Newsom said the president was “playing with fire” and warned that California was prepared to consider new boundaries to “neutralize” any gains Republicans hope to achieve in Texas.

“This attempt to rig congressional maps to hold onto power before a single vote is cast in the 2026 election is an affront to American democracy,” Newsom wrote.

The governor said he would prefer to leave the matter of congressional map-making to independent commissions, not partisan legislative bodies and emphasized that he would “happily” stand down if other states abandoned their redistricting effort. But, Newsom said: “California cannot stand idly by as this power grab unfolds.”

In a snarky, all-caps tweet meant to mimic Trump's social media style, Newsom's office summarized the letter: “DONALD TRUMP, IF YOU DO NOT STAND DOWN, WE WILL BE FORCED TO LEAD AN EFFORT TO REDRAW THE MAPS IN CA TO OFFSET THE RIGGING OF MAPS IN RED STATES. BUT IF THE OTHER STATES CALL OFF THEIR REDISTRICTING EFFORTS, WE WILL DO THE SAME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But when asked, Trump has defended the Texas plan, arguing that he is “entitled to five more seats” because he won the state's popular vote in the 2024 presidential election. The argument, however, is flawed – a popular vote win does not necessarily mean a president's party is awarded more congressional seats.

Despite Newsom's appeal, the White House is seeking to enlist other red states in the redistricting clash. Last week, vice-president JD Vance traveled to Indiana, where he met with state Republican leaders to lobby them on the effort. Republicans have also targeted Ohio and Missouri.

At a press conference with several quorum-breaking Texas lawmakers, as well as California's legislative leaders, Newsom outlined his plan to ask voters to override the existing congressional maps drawn by an independent commission and accept a new proposal to create five more Democratic-leaning seats. The governor expressed confidence that voters would approve the plan and said the state legislature would act in time to get the measure on the ballot this November.

Kathy Hochul, the New York governor, and JB Pritzker, the Illinois governor, have also vowed to take action.

At the Texas capitol in Austin, Dustin Burrows, the state house speaker, adjourned the session moments after opening it on Monday, in a fourth failed attempt since the Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, convened a special session in large part to approve a mid-decade redistricting plan aimed at flipping five Democratic-held seats and securing a GOP house majority in the 2026 midterm elections.

In brief remarks, Burrows said the department of public safety had deployed special agents across Texas to locate the absent Democrats who have civil warrants out for their arrest. Agents, he said, were set up outside the members' homes, conducting surveillance, repeatedly knocking on their doors and calling their phones.

“So far, no one is home,” he said, adding: “The search continues and it will not stop.”

DPS has set a tip line for the public to report any information regarding the “whereabouts” of the Democratic lawmakers. But those out of state are beyond the reach of Texas authorities.

Since Sunday, Texas Republicans have ratcheted up the political, legal and financial stakes for the Democrats who left.

The Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, a far-right ally of the president, asked the state supreme court to vacate the seats of 13 out-of-state Democrats. He also asked an Illinois court to enforce the Texas civil warrants. Abbott has separately asked the state supreme court that seeks to remove Gene Wu, the house Democratic leader, from office. John Cornyn, a Republican US senator facing a rightwing primary challenge by Paxton, has said the FBI agreed to assist Texas authorities locate the Democrats, though the agency declined to comment and it remains unclear what authority federal law enforcement would have, as they are not charged with federal crimes.

The Democrats have indicated that they intend to stay away until at least the end of the current special session on 19 August. Speaking earlier on Monday from Illinois, Texas state lawmaker Mihaela Plesa said she and her Democratic colleagues were “more committed than ever” to stopping Trump from gaining Republican seats. “We don't take our marching orders from a man who thinks he's a king,” she said, adding: “We don't back down when the stakes are high.”

But the Texas governor has vowed to call special sessions again and again until enough return to the state house.

“If they show back up in the state of Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the capitol,” Abbott said in a weekend interview on Fox News Sunday.

Burrows claimed that the members would be responsible for “every gallon of gas, every mile traveled, and every hour of overtime” spent trying to track them down. Under legislative rules, they face a $500 daily fine for each absence.

Burrows said the House would attempt to reconvene again on Tuesday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Associated Press

12:06 JST, August 12, 2025

A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island's coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse.

According to the lawsuit filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Friday, Ohtani's agent, Nez Balelo, increasingly demanded concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding that their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal.

“Balelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani's promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs' role in the project — for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,” the lawsuit claims.

The suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture.

A spokesman for Balelo's agency, CAA Baseball, declined comment. Attempts to reach Kingsbarn officials for comment were not immediately successful.

“This case is about abuse of power,” the lawsuit says. “Defendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built.

“Defendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants' misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all — celebrity or not.”

Ohtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series.

Investment materials for The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort, which remained online on Monday night, listed Hayes and Matsumoto as part of the management team, along with Kingsbarn. It called Ohtani “Japan's Babe Ruth” and the “1st Resident,” giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, “one of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,” Hapuna Beach, “rated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler” and two golf courses – one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr.

“Ohtani will act as the celebrity spokesperson for the project and has committed to purchasing one of the 14 residences within the project,” the brochure says. “He also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training.”

The suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and “as part of a bold marketing strategy” signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, “one of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable.”

“This partnership with Ohtani will elevate the demand and create buzz within the Japanese luxury vacation home market, which is a primary target audience for the project,” the investment brochure said. “We see Shohei Ohtani's homeownership as having a significant impact on the global exposure of the project and expect to accelerate the pace of sales, thereby helping us achieve our pricing objectives.”

The suit said Balelo “quickly became a disruptive force,” threatening to pull Ohtani from the deal if concessions weren't made.

“Kingsbarn began capitulating to Balelo's every whim,” the suit said. “Over time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with Otani than honoring its obligations to its business partners.”

Last month, in what the suit called “a coordinated ambush,” Kingsbarn fired Hayes and Matsumoto.

“Kingsbarn openly admitted during the call that Balelo had demanded the terminations and that they were being done solely to placate him,” the suit said. “Plaintiffs stand to lose millions of dollars in compensation tied to projected homebuilding profit, construction management fees, and broker commissions.”

YOKOHAMA — Japanese table tennis ace Tomokazu Harimoto made a strategic choice to abandon one of his strongest techniques, and it paid off by adding an impressive title to his growing resume.

Harimoto defeated reigning world champion Wang Chuqin 4-2 in the men's final of the WTT Champions Yokohama tournament on Monday, avenging a whitewash loss to the Chinese star just a month ago.

The world No. 4-ranked Harimoto stormed out of the blocks to win the first three games, then rebounded after Wang took the next two to put away the match 11-9, 11-5, 11-8, 9-11, 11-13, 11-4 before a partisan crowd at Yokohama Buntai arena.

Harimoto went into the match with just two wins over Wang in 14 career meetings, including his straight sets loss last month in the United States. Needing an edge, Harimoto decided to not use the “chiquita,” a powerful backhand return with tremendous spin that curves like a banana.

“He's the one guy who can return it with twice as much power,” Harimoto said of the No. 2-ranked Wang.

The match went according to plan, leaving Wang struggling for answers as Harimoto used for less-aggressive style and settled for winning rallies.

“I can't believe it,” Harimoto repeatedly said after the match.

Earlier, Harimoto advanced to the final with a 4-1 victory over Kanak Jha of the United States.

In an all-Chinese women's final, Chen Xingtong defeated world champion Sun Yingsha 4-2.

Editor's note: This article has been updated to include the latest report from Ukraine's General Staff.

Russian forces have made a push toward the Dobropillia–Kramatorsk highway in Donetsk Oblast, seizing positions in nearby settlements to support further offensive operations, the Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState reported on Aug. 11.

The updated map, compiled by DeepState through a mix of open-source data and testimonies from units on the ground, shows the grey zone touching the highway, which was used regularly by civilian and military traffic as recently as mid-July. 

Dobropillia lies 94 kilometers northwest of Russian-occupied Donetsk, and about 22 kilometers north of the embattled city of Pokrovsk.

Leveraging their numerical superiority, Russian forces have advanced into Kucheriv Yar, Zolotyi Kolodiaz, and Vesele, where they are reportedly consolidating positions for a renewed offensive and full occupation, according to DeepState.

Russian troops are also attempting to establish a foothold in Petrivka and Novovodiane, on the other side of the highway.

The Russian push, an extension of the Russian offensive between Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast that has been underway since spring, gained pace dramatically over August, bringing key Ukrainian logistics routes into the range of Russian first-person view (FPV) drones.

Piercing the Ukrainian defense far west of the main agglomeration of Ukrainian-controlled cities in Donetsk Oblast — Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Druzhkivka, and Kostiantynivka — these latest gains threaten to severely compromise Kyiv's overall defense of the war-torn eastern region.

New fortifications have been built around Zolotyi Kolodiaz, Shakhove, and nearby settlements — positions that Russian forces are currently bypassing but may seize and repurpose for defensive use in future operations, DeepState said.

""After final consolidation and accumulation, attempts to move deeper into the territory will be inevitable, and drone crews will be brought in, which will complicate the restructuring of alternative logistics and the maintenance of surrounding positions by Ukrainian forces,"" the report read.

""With this development of events, if it does not change, we may encounter a situation where Dobropillia falls faster than Pokrovsk.""

Ukraine's General Staff said in its evening update that Russian forces carried out 35 assaults in the Pokrovsk area on Aug. 11 . The heaviest fighting was reported near Poltavka, Popiv Yar, Mayak, Dorozhne, Nikanorivka, Kucheriv Yar, Nove Shakove, Novoeekonomichne, Sukhetske, Rodynske, Promin, Udachne, Lysivka, Zvirove, and Horikhove, with three battles still underway.

The General Staff said Russian troops are exploiting their numerical advantage, attempting to ""breach Ukrainian lines in small groups despite sustaining heavy losses."" 

""The Commander-in-Chief has decided to deploy additional forces and resources to detect and destroy enemy sabotage groups that are penetrating the defense line,"" the announcement said. 

The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify these reports. The press officers of two Ukrainian brigades known to be fighting in the area declined to comment on the situation.

The news comes as Russia, facing the prospect of peace talks, has aimed to surge forward on the front line to put itself in the best position at a potential negotiating table. 

The hottest parts of the front line remain in Donetsk Oblast, where Ukrainian brigades, all severely understrength in infantry, are battling to hold the line against a Russian attacking force that has learned to target weak points in the Ukrainian defense.

Civilian evacuations from contested or occupied areas remain extremely dangerous, with Russian forces repeatedly accused of targeting non-combatants.

Stand Up Alaska NGO plans to hold a protest ahead of the upcoming meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the northwestern U.S. state, according to an Aug. 11 statement.

As Washington seeks a path to end the war in Ukraine, the upcoming Aug. 15 meeting between Trump and Putin will mark their first face-to-face talks since the start of Trump's second term.

""We're here to tell Trump and Putin: Alaska opposes tyranny!"" Stand Up Alaska's statement read.

The rally, scheduled for Aug. 14 in Anchorage, Alaska's largest city, is being held to protest the ""presence of an international war criminal"" and as a show of solidarity with Ukraine, the NGO said.

Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy previously said the state was prepared to host the upcoming meeting between Trump and Putin, calling the event ""historic.""

""Alaska is the most strategic location in the world, sitting at the crossroads of North America and Asia, with the Arctic to our north and the Pacific to our south,"" Dunvealy wrote on X on Aug. 9.

""With a mere two miles separating Russia from Alaska, no other place plays a more vital role in our national defense, energy security, and Arctic leadership,"" he added.

Trump announced the summit with Putin on Aug. 8 and reportedly told Ukraine and European leaders that the Kremlin is open to negotiations if ""land swaps"" are part of the deal.

Though it remains unclear what such a deal would entail, a source in Ukraine's Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent that Moscow seeks Kyiv's full withdrawal from partially occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in the east while offering to withdraw its forces from the limited areas it holds in the northeastern Sumy and Kharkiv oblasts.

Publicly, Putin has demanded a ban on Ukraine's NATO membership and a full Ukrainian withdrawal from partially occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts as a precondition for peace talks.

In turn, Zelensky has rejected formally ceding territory to Russia and urged a ceasefire as the first step toward peace talks, a position backed by Kyiv's European partners.

Zelensky is also expected to hold talks with European leaders and Trump two days before the summit in Alaska, on Aug. 13.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story. 

A plant producing synthetic sapphires in the Russian city of Stavropol was hit by drones overnight on Aug. 12, the Russian independent Telegram news channel Astra reported, citing local residents. 

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the reports at the time of publication. Ukraine rarely comments on reports of attacks on industrial facilities in Russia. 

Residents of Stavropol in Russia's southern Stavropol Krai said that drones were attacking the city's JSC Monocrystal plant. Footage taken by locals shows smoke rising from the same street where the factory is located, according to Astra. 

Locals also reported explosions, and photos from the scene show a fire at the attack site. 

Earlier in the night, Stavropol Krai Governor Vladimir Vladimirov issued a drone warning for the area. Following the attack, Stavropol Mayor Ivan Ulyanchenko said the drone attack had been ""repelled"" and that there were no casualties. 

Ulyanchenko did not mention the strike on the Monocrystal factory, claiming only that windows had been broken at an unnamed ""social facility."" 

Monocrystal is one of the world's leading manufacturers of synthetic sapphire, which is used in optoelectronics, solar energy, and the aerospace industry. Synthetic sapphire is used in optical systems, sensors, and lasers, including military devices. 

Monocrystal is a subsidiary of Energomera, an electronics and manufacturing company. 

Kyiv regularly attacks industrial and military sites in Russia using domestically produced long-range drones in an effort to degrade Moscow's ability to wage war in Ukraine. In late July, Ukraine's State Security Service (SBU) confirmed that a drone strike hit the Signal radio plant in Stavropol Krai.

The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec earned a 4.6-per-cent return in the first half of the year, beating its 4.3-per-cent benchmark as the pension fund's chief executive officer warned the full economic impact of U.S. tariffs is not yet clear.

Total assets increased $23-billion to $496-billion in the six months to June 30, and the fund also surpassed its benchmarks for five- and 10-year returns. Over the last decade, the Caisse has earned an average annual return of 7 per cent. 

Publicly-traded equities led the way with a 6-per-cent return, bolstered by a 4.5-per-cent gain from infrastructure investments. Real estate lagged, increasing by 0.1 per cent and falling short of a 1.2-per-cent benchmark, and private equity recorded a modest 3.4-per-cent increase. 

A debate is raging over Canadian pension plans' domestic investments — and Caisse's CEO is at the centre of it all

Caisse CEO Charles Emond cautioned that tariff issues stemming from U.S. policy were a “major concern” in the first half of the year as markets plunged in April before bouncing back, and could still be cause for concern in the coming months.

“Despite this overall performance, we must remain vigilant as we have yet to see the full effects of the U.S. administration's measures,” Mr. Emond said in a statement. 

One scenario on the Caisse's radar is the possibility that tariff measures could slow the U.S. economy and raise prices, driving up inflation and causing central banks to respond by holding interest rates higher. 

“The rest of the year will be interesting,” Mr. Emond said at a Tuesday press conference with reporters. “The full impact of inflation has not been felt.”

A rapid depreciation of the U.S. dollar put a dent in the Caisse's returns, as though a hedging strategy offset nearly half of the potential losses.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","Treasuries have dozed off for the summer","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-treasuries-have-dozed-off-for-the-summer/","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 09:24:28 GMT","

The Treasury market appears to have nodded off while the stock market cruises at record highs. 

It may just be the summer doldrums, but it's a head-scratcher for investors who've fretted about a looming bust-up in both.

 The implementation of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff sweep last week - which markets had obsessed about for months - was a non-event in the financial world.

While the true fallout has arguably yet to play out and could well take the form of a slow burn over time, nothing resembling April's shock has unfolded in markets.

Perhaps the outstanding metric of the moment is Treasury bond volatility, or the lack thereof. For all the outsized fears about the U.S. fiscal situation, climbing debt loads, tariff-related inflation and Federal Reserve independence, the bond market's “fear index” is at its lowest point in three years. 

The MOVE index, which captures implied volatility across the Treasury spectrum, has plummeted since peaking in April, slipping to about half of where it was after the “Liberation Day” markets blowout. It's also below its 20-year average, two decades that were largely defined by paltry inflation and massive Federal Reserve bond buying.

And, ironically, this stasis can create its own positive energy.

For one, subdued Treasury volatility can reduce so-called “haircuts” in securities lending because the lower the level of volatility - and hence the lower the implied risk - the more cash an investor can borrow when Treasuries are posted as collateral in repurchase deals.

That, in turn, can help loosen financial conditions at the margins, regardless of nominal borrowing rates per se. Indeed, that's likely already happening. Broad financial conditions indexes are the loosest they've been since early 2022, thanks also to record-high equity markets, narrow credit spreads and low energy prices.

And looking at the seemingly frozen government bond market through a fundamental lens gives it a relatively benign gloss.

U.S. interest rates look set to resume falling, but not because of a recession that could force the Fed to slash them quickly, so there's little risk of the type of bond volatility spike seen during the brief banking crisis of March 2023, for example.

The debt worries that intensified around the passage of the recent “One Big Beautiful Bill” have been partially neutralized by both Fed easing hopes and speculation that Treasury will simply frontload any additional new debt sales with bills and short notes that benefit most from falling official rates.

Deregulation of the mushrooming universe of stablecoins, digital tokens with fixed dollar exchange rates that are now required to be backed by short-term Treasury bill holdings, are expected to ease that short debt sale focus too.

As to market positioning, the latest Bank of America global funds survey shows that a net 5 per cent of asset managers polled were underweight bonds. While that sounds low, it's still 1.5 standard deviations above long-term averages for the 25-year survey. So any massive shift in allocations seems unlikely.

Few extremes then to fret about, it seems.

If a combination of mounting fiscal fears, a multi-month tariff campaign and a stubborn - or even politically-compromised - Fed can't shake this bond market, then the summer doldrums may be here to stay.

Opposition lawmakers were arrested after protesting against electoral roll revisions, including in the key northern state of Bihar. Critics fear that Modi's Hindu nationalist BJP aims to disenfranchise Muslim voters.

Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi was among dozens of lawmakers temporarily detained by police in New Delhi on Monday following a protest against perceived electoral malpractice.

Around 300 opposition parliamentarians, including Gandhi, marched towards the Election Commission headquarters, jumping barricades and shouting that recent elections had been ""stolen.""

They claim that electoral rolls in key states have been altered to the benefit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with more to come.

""This fight is not political; this fight is to save the constitution,"" Gandhi told reporters as he and others were taken to a nearby police station. ""We want a clean, pure voters' list.""

Monday's demonstration came after a decision by the Election Commission to carry out a large-scale revision of the electoral roll in the northern state of Bihar, which the opposition say could render millions of citizens unable to vote.

The process requires voters to submit official documentation such as birth certificates, passports and matriculation records, which critics say could be hard to come by for many in Bihar, one of the poorest parts of India where literacy rates are among the lowest in the country.

Bihar is also home to a significant Muslim minority (around 17.7% according to the 2023 census) who opposition lawmakers fear could be particularly disenfranchised ahead of state elections later this year.

A similar exercise in the northeastern state of Assam in 2019 left nearly two million people — many of them Muslims — at risk of statelessness.

Nevertheless, Prime Minister Modi's BJP has backed the revision, arguing that it is necessary to update new voters and delete the names of those who may have died or moved to other states.

The Election Commission said the changes were needed to avoid the ""inclusion of the names of foreign illegal immigrants"" — shorthand in the context of Bihar for undocumented Muslims who may have arrived from neighboring Bangladesh.

The BJP said opposition parties were trying to create a ""state of anarchy"" by sowing seeds of doubt about the electoral process. ""They are in a state of bankruptcy because of their continuous losses,"" said Federal Minister Dharmendra Pradhan.

A new executive order grants Trump appointees authority over all US federal research funding. Critics say the order is an authoritarian assault on science. 

The US position as a global leader in science has long hinged on its research freedom and independence from political interference. A new executive order signed by US President Donald Trump on August 7 now threatens to overturn this paradigm.

The executive order, titled ""Improving Oversight of Federal Grantmaking"", grants political appointees sweeping authority over all federal grant funding. 

If implemented, political appointees — not scientists — would take control over decisions about research grants. It would, among other changes, allow political appointees to overrule advice from scientists on award decisions, and let them terminate ongoing grants based on political criteria. 

Scientists and research advocates have slammed the executive order, saying it will replace scientific merit with ideological loyalty to the Trump administration.

The executive order is ""a direct attack on scientific integrity at federal agencies,"" Kenneth Evans, an expert in science and technology public policy at Rice University in Texas, told DW.

Victor Ambros, who won the 2024 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of microRNA, called the order ""unpatriotic in the extreme.""

""[The order is] a shameless, full-bore Soviet-style politicization of American science that will smother what until now has been the world's preeminent scientific enterprise. Until this administration, the single overarching priority for public funding of research has been scientific excellence. That is why our country has been so successful in delivering life-saving and life-enriching discoveries,"" Ambros said in a statement. 

In the last decade, the US Congress awarded ~$200 billion (€172 billion) in research grants annually to advance critical research on diseases, new technologies like AI and life-saving medicines. 

US-based researchers have applied for research grants from federal science agencies like the National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH). 

Whether scientists are awarded grants they've applied for depends on independent peer review. Panels of experts evaluate research proposals based on evidence, methodology and potential impact.

The August 7 executive order changes that. Peer review from scientific experts is now only advisory — final grant-making decisions have been placed in the hands of political appointees. Those appointees can refuse to fund new grants that don't align with Donald Trump's political agenda.

""[Funding] awards must, where applicable, demonstrably advance the President's policy priorities,"" the paper states.

The order cites critical race theory, transgender sexual education programs and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) research as ""far-left initiatives"" that are an ""offensive waste of tax dollars.""

This executive order is the latest attack on scientific research and US universities by the Trump administration. 

Trump froze all US federal science funding in February and has cut top science roles at NASA.

Funding has also been cut in climate science , gender-related topics and research on potentially life-saving mRNA vaccine technologies.

""The executive order is the latest in a nonstop campaign from the Trump administration to make the [research] environment for young scientists in America as hostile as possible,"" Evans said.

At a minumum, the executive order will upend the peer review process at funding agencies.

""At worst, it could turn off the flow of funding to any area of research that Trump or his appointees don't like or believe are counter to 'American values'."" Evans said.

Medical associations warn that the President's ongoing assault on science is derailing the US' reputation as a scientific powerhouse and crippling vital research.

""Grant review by political appointees will further impede the work of the scientific community to provide solutions and fight public health threats,"" said American Society for Microbiology CEO Stefano Bertuzzi.

""With strong and responsible oversight, we need to harness — not suppress — all perspectives and approaches in the effort to solve these problems,"" said Bertuzzi in a statement. 

Given that the executive order faces such strong criticism, it will almost certainly also face legal challenges, said Evans.

Opponents are likely to argue that the order violates safeguards designed to keep scientific research free from political oversight.

""Congress can continue to push back against Trump's proposed spending levels. Science advocacy groups that represent the research community will lead the charge on both fronts as they have in response to previous actions from the Trump administration,"" said Evans.

			Proposal for 600 National Guard troops stationed across Alabama and Arizona bases to be deployed at short notice

The Trump administration is reportedly weighing plans to establish a “domestic civil disturbance” force of hundreds of National Guard troops to deal with protests and unrest.

Internal Pentagon documents reportedly outline a proposal for 600 troops stationed across military bases in Alabama and Arizona, ready to go at a moment's notice.

The plan, seen by The Washington Post, suggests a rotation model using troops from units in multiple states, with personnel equipped with weapons and riot gear, and deployments lasting 90 days to “limit burnout”.

The first 100 servicemen would be ready to be deployed within one hour, according to the plans, with the second and third waves mobilised within two and 12 hours.

If military aircraft and aircrews were needed on standby, the plans could cost hundreds of millions of dollars, according to documents seen by the Post.

The proposal suggests Donald Trump plans to continue using US forces domestically.

It comes after the US president made the extraordinary move to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington DC to tackle crime in the capital.

National Guard soldiers were seen arriving in the city on Tuesday morning. Pictures showed troops, dressed in camouflage, reporting for duty in the capital.

As well as deploying 800 National Guard troops to Washington, Mr Trump said he would bring the city's police department under federal control, becoming the first president in history to do so.

Critics questioned Mr Trump's true intentions with the move, pointing to police data showing violent crimes in Washington had been in decline since 2023.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Kamala Harris's former running mate, said of the move: “The road to authoritarianism is littered with people telling you you're overreacting.”

Meanwhile, rumoured Democrat 2028 hopeful, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker warned Mr Trump that he has “absolutely no right and no legal ability” to send troops to Chicago, adding: “I have talked about the fact that the Nazis in Germany in the '30s tore down a constitutional republic in just 53 days.

“It does not take much, frankly, and we have a president who seems hell-bent on doing just that.”

Muriel Bowser, the city's mayor, called the move “unsettling and unprecedented,” although she conceded that more policing in high-crime neighbourhoods could be a good thing.

Hours after Mr Trump made the announcement, a man was shot dead close to the scene of two attacks raised by the US president during his announcement on Monday.

The suspected homicide happened within half a mile of where a congressional intern was killed by a stray bullet last month and where a former government official was killed in his car last year during a failed carjacking attempt.

The numbers floated in the Pentagon proposal amount to a fraction of the 5,000 National Guard troops and Marines Mr Trump deployed to Los Angeles after anti-ICE protests erupted across the city earlier this year.

A similar idea to the proposed “domestic civil disturbance quick reaction force” was floated following Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, with around 600 troops put on notice in Arizona and Alabama.

It is not clear whether the Pentagon proposal has been reviewed by Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary.

The documents were compiled by National Guard officials, with at least one action memo prepared by Elbridge Colby, a national security policy chief, which recommends the forces should receive extra training for this mission.

Mr Colby is said to have frustrated Mr Trump earlier this year when he reportedly froze military aid to Ukraine because US stockpiles were low. The move was rapidly reversed by Mr Trump amid criticism of government incohesion.

The proposal suggests the earliest the rapid response taskforce could be funded through the Pentagon is 2027.

Concerns highlighted in the proposal include the depleted availability of troops for local emergencies, such as wildfires and hurricanes, as well as questions over the appropriate use of the force.

The Telegraph has contacted the DoD for comment.

The Israeli security cabinet approved a plan presented by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on August 8 to fully occupy the Gaza Strip and forcibly displace the residents of Gaza City from the north of the territory to the south. 

The news of the plan spread rapidly among those of us in Gaza, leaving us in a state of shock and despair. We had been following the updates in hopes of hearing about a possible ceasefire — not a full occupation and a new wave of displacement. Since the Israeli plan was announced, the Israeli army has intensified its artillery bombardment and airstrikes on the southern part of Gaza City.

The decision comes at a time when starvation has severely gripped the Gaza Strip. According to UN officials, since late May, nearly 1,400 people struggling to obtain basic food supplies have been killed through Israel's failed food distribution. In addition, more than 500,000 people in Gaza are facing starvation, and all 320,000 children under the age of 5 are at risk of severe malnutrition. 

The Israeli plan was met with condemnation from both Western and Arab countries, who warned that it would further diminish the chances of achieving a permanent ceasefire and bring nothing but more destruction and suffering. Nevertheless, Netanyahu insisted that he would press ahead with his plan, refusing to yield to rhetorical pressure from other nations.

Some reports, citing statements from Israeli officials, indicated that the plan will be implemented in phases. The first phase involves the occupation of Gaza City by displacing its roughly 1 million residents to areas Israel designates as “safe zones,” while providing what Netanyahu's office describes as humanitarian aid to civilians outside the combat zones. Israel has bombed safe zones it has designated itself repeatedly over the course of its assault on Gaza; meanwhile, the current aid scheme run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has been described by the UN as a “death trap.”

The mass forcible displacement will reportedly be followed by intensified airstrikes aimed at clearing the way for troops to encircle the city and conduct incursions into residential neighborhoods. Netanyahu has said that the military will also focus on occupying the refugee camps in the central Strip.

In Gaza City, most people view this plan as a continuation of Israel's systematic strategy to replicate the devastation seen in Gaza's northern governorate, Rafah, and Khan Younis — targeting the few remaining areas in the Strip that still have residential buildings and landmarks. This could pave the way for Israeli right-wing extremists to bring back settlements in Gaza and confine the Palestinian population to a specific area in the south, in preparation for their forced displacement outside the Strip.

During the 22-month war, most of Gaza City's neighborhoods — now marked as the first target in Israel's latest plan — have endured bloody massacres, relentless bombardment, suffocating starvation, and temporary military incursions. However, they have so far been spared the total destruction that devastated Rafah and other parts of the Strip, as the most intense fighting and incursions have, until now, been concentrated in the city's eastern areas, including Al-Tufah, Al-Shujaiya, and Al-Zaytun. 

Now, Gaza City — especially its central and western areas, which were already overcrowded with residents — has become even more congested, as thousands of evacuees have poured in from the eastern part of the city and from the northern governorate, including Beit Hanoun, Jabalia, and Beit Lahia. This influx followed the Israeli military operation called Gideon's Chariots by Israel, and known as “Markeb Jadoun” on the ground in Gaza, which launched in May. By that operation's end, Israel had seized large parts of the northern Strip and confined its population to specific areas within Gaza City.

Most people in Gaza City, including both evacuees and original residents who lost their homes, are now living in flimsy tents that lack basic necessities, crammed into makeshift camps set up in any available spaces — playgrounds, parks, and even along Gaza City's beach. Others have taken shelter in schools and public institutions that have been converted into housing for displaced families, where conditions are equally harsh; in some cases, a single classroom accommodates three or four families.

The overcrowded conditions in Gaza City mean that any large-scale military invasion would trigger a humanitarian catastrophe, forcing more than 900,000 people to flee under the looming threat of massacres and a bloody invasion. They would be pushed toward the south, where evacuation orders have already covered most areas and Israeli forces have seized two of the area's largest cities — Rafah and Khan Younis.

Ahmed Totah, 56, said that during the ceasefire in January 2025, he and his family managed to return to their home in the Jabalia refugee camp after 16 months of displacement in the south. However, Totah was only able to live in his home for two months before the Israeli military resumed the war and expanded their operations in the north, reaching his neighborhood.Refusing to move back south, Totah decided to flee to the western part of Gaza City, to an area called Al-Rimal, where he set up his tent in a public park called Al-Jundi.

“Isn't the hell we are already living through enough?” Totah said. “Now Israel wants to displace us once again to the south. We have no food or clean water, and we live in flimsy tents that offer no protection from the scorching sun or the cold of winter. On top of that, the daily bombardments terrorize us. We are exhausted and have no energy left to face the suffering of yet another displacement. We have literally reached a point where we prefer death over living this life.”

Rawan Husain Ali, 22, said she has been displaced in the heart of Gaza City since the early days of the war, after her neighborhood, Al-Shujaiya, was declared a dangerous war zone by the Israeli army. “The news of the Israeli occupation plan for Gaza City has brought back all the dark memories of destruction, killing, and displacement I endured in Al-Shujaiya,” she said. “My entire family is now consumed by worry, depression, and relentless thoughts about where we will live, where we will go, and how long our displacement will last. We have already lost our father and our home — we cannot bear to lose anything more or be displaced to the unknown. We can no longer endure such horrors.”

As hundred thousands of families in Gaza City, like those of Husain Ali and Totah, brace for yet another chapter of suffering that could end in their displacement from the Strip, Palestinians in Gaza ask an urgent question : Will the world move beyond mere words to take meaningful action that protects civilians, halt Israel's catastrophic plan, and save what remains of the devastated Strip before it is too late?

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

The leaders must now translate positive experiences from the Pan-American Congress into action in their home countries.

On the final day of the Second Pan-American Congress this month, more than 60 delegates from 12 countries made their way into the Secretary of Public Education headquarters in downtown Mexico City. As leaders from the Americas walked through the building's passages and patios, many stopped to take pictures in front of the walls lined with murals from famous artists, including Diego Rivera.

The UNESCO World Heritage Site served as the location of the final plenary of the three-day gathering aimed at uniting progressive and democratic forces in the Western hemisphere to take on rising far right authoritarianism.

Delegates representing communities from as far as Nunavut in Canada to the extreme southern tip of South America eventually took their seats in the Ibero-American Hall, a space adorned with a massive, nearly 1,500-square-foot mural, appropriately called “The Union of Latin America” by Roberto Montenegro.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

From this hall, the message from Mexico was unambiguous: The peoples and the elected representatives of this hemisphere are ready to act to confront the global threat of fascism.

“We are of course facing an authoritarian threat in the world: it is the return of fascist positions to power,” María José Pizarro, a Colombian senator from the ruling Pacto Historico coalition, told Truthout. “In the face of this, we must therefore build joint strategies that allow us to confront it in the best possible way in countries where this is already happening, and in those where it is not, to prevent the return of this type of government.” 

When it comes to hemispheric relations, U.S. President Donald Trump has pursued what has been described as a “divide and conquer” strategy, leveraging the national interests of one country against another and pitting neighbors against each other in order to squeeze out concessions from leaders. Trump has been able to follow this strategy to varying degrees of success, in part due to the lack of unity regarding the threat he represents to the entire world.

“[Fascism] is not a regional threat, it's not a threat to one country, it's a threat that's growing worldwide,” said Pizarro.

From the Atlas Network, a coalition of right-wing think tanks and advocacy groups that promote neoliberal policies globally, to Trump's open and blatant interference inside Brazil in order to back his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, in the face of charges over his effort to carry out a coup after losing the 2022 election, the far right has been successful in building trans-national links.

One aim of the Pan-American Congress is to break down barriers between progressives and anti-fascists who have historically lacked an institutional space to better coordinate their own regional response.

One standout feature of this gathering was the participation of elected representatives from the United States, including Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota), Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Illinois), Delia Ramírez (D-Illinois), and Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan); Canadian Members of Parliament (MPs), such as interim New Democratic Party leader Don Davies, Leah Gazan, and Lori Idlout; and MPs from the governing Liberals, such as Michael Coteau, also attended.

Pizarro, who is also a potential candidate for Colombia's 2026 presidential election, described the participation of U.S. and Canadian lawmakers at the Pan-American Congress as “fundamental” and expressed optimism that this would be the beginning of a closer relationship with progressives in North America.

“We don't see ourselves as isolated from North America, but rather the opposite, as part of an American continent that integrates us all,” said Pizarro. “We rarely have the opportunity to listen to each other, to talk, especially today when the United States government is speaking out strongly about its position on Latin America, its relationship with Latin America, and that conversation with progressive Democratic congressmembers, of course, must be strengthened,” she added.

The enthusiasm for building closer ties goes both ways. 

U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib said she drew inspiration from her conversations with other lawmakers fighting for their communities and the power of connecting with fellow activists across the Americas. 

“We don't see ourselves as isolated from North America, but rather the opposite, as part of an American continent that integrates us all.”

Tlaib drew parallels from her experience growing up in Detroit, Michigan, in a neighborhood impacted by corporate pollution with the stories she heard from colleagues at the congress from Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico.

“These corporations don't care about these borders. They come and extract, make us sick, and just leave us with nothing,” said Tlaib.

But now she says she feels “less alone in this fight against corporate greed, against corporate polluters, against those that don't care about our communities thriving.”

Tlaib cited her conversations with Canadian MPs about the need to collaborate in the fight against the environmental threat posed by the Line 5 pipeline that threatens water systems in both the U.S. and Canada. 

“We are now building these bridges and creating a movement that brings all of us together and understanding that connectivity,” Tlaib told Truthout.

Tlaib, the first Palestinian woman to serve in U.S. Congress and an important voice on the global stage speaking out against Israel's ongoing genocide of Palestinians, also expressed gratitude at the centering of the Palestinian people's cause at the gathering. At every event over the course of the weekend, speakers spoke up in support of Palestine in no uncertain terms, firmly expressing their solidarity.

“It's very rare that you see that in the United States Congress, but we saw it at the Pan-American Congress,” said Tlaib.

Coming on the heels of July's Emergency Conference on Palestine, which likewise saw world leaders gather to take action in an attempt to halt the genocide, delegates at the congress said recognizing the state of Palestine was only a starting point. 

“In our view, much deeper actions, much more forceful voices — and of course, the role being played by multilateral organizations, which have been stripped of their value and the ability to defend life in the face of the genocide being perpetrated against the Palestinian people — are essential,” said Pizarro.

Meanwhile, Colombian Deputy Minister of Multilateral Affairs Mauricio Jaramillo Jassir argued that countries with progressive governments have no choice but to break diplomatic relations with Israel.

In addition to calling for an end to the genocide against the Palestinian people, participants in the conference discussed Trump's human rights violations against migrants and refugees, and the need to confront climate change.

During his speech at the opening session, Mexican Senate President Gerardo Fernández Noroña said the two defining features of the rising fascist threat in the world were the suffering inflicted on Palestinians and the abuse of migrants by the U.S.

“It is an unjust, vile, incorrect persecution where, by virtue of being a migrant, or the color of your skin or your nationality, people are persecuted,” said Noroña.

The mistreatment of migrants is the clearest case study on the necessity of confronting fascism in the Americas. Trump has leaned on allies like El Salvador's far right President Nayib Bukele, who infamously agreed to detain more than 230 Venezuelan migrants sent from the U.S. in his notorious mega-prison before negotiations between Caracas and Washington eventually secured their release. 

Mexico in particular has faced enormous pressure from both U.S. political parties to crack down on migrants transiting through its territory as they try to reach the United States. More recently, the Mexican government has had to face down repeated tariff threats from Trump over the issue of migration. 

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has explicitly declined to become a third-country destination for non-Mexican asylum seekers and has resisted U.S. efforts to impose such arrangements. As a result, the Trump administration has secured agreements with Guatemala and Honduras instead, arrangements that ultimately serve to undermine efforts by any one country in the region to resist the U.S.'s mass deportation agenda.

The selection of Mexico City as the host of the Second Pan-American Congress (the first having been held last year in Bogotá, Colombia) offered delegates the opportunity to learn from the political project known locally as the “Fourth Transformation,” the leftist national political project to shift Mexico to a post-neoliberal model that began with the election of Andrés Manuel López Obrador in 2018 and continued under President Sheinbaum.

With the election of Sheinbaum in 2024, Mexico proved to be one of the few countries that bucked a trend in which voters ousted incumbents and replaced them, in many cases, with right-wing populists, such as Javier Milei in Argentina.

Sheinbaum, who has been lauded for repeatedly standing up to Trump, welcomed delegates at the National Palace, allowing representatives from throughout the hemisphere to share their experiences resisting the U.S. president — and also to share firsthand how Mexico has been able to not only navigate an intemperate neighbor, but also continue to press forward with its anti-neoliberal political agenda. 

“These corporations don't care about these borders. They come and extract, make us sick, and just leave us with nothing.”

Canadian MP Leah Gazan, a member of the Wood Mountain Lakota Nation who represents Winnipeg in Canada's House of Commons, said her time in Mexico left her feeling renewed and hopeful.

“What's happened in Mexico is so inspiring … and to see women, progressive women, strong women, leading the narrative about the importance of humanizing politics, the importance of rooting democracy and human rights, is a refreshing change from what we're witnessing in Canada right now,” Gazan told Truthout.

“I think we have a lot of lessons to learn from the Global South,” said Gazan.

The challenge facing elected representatives now is translating the positive experiences from the congress in Mexico into action in their home countries.

During a Pan-American Congress event at the Esperanza Iris Theatre in Mexico City, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar renewed her pledge to fight for marginalized communities throughout the hemisphere from her place inside the U.S. Congress, signaling to the peoples of the Global South that they have an ally in her.

“Since being in the elected office, I've made an effort to set myself apart as somebody who sees the global community as one, someone who understands our destinies and our fates are intertwined, someone who understands that being in the United States provides us with great privileges but also with responsibilities,” Omar told Truthout.

Omar has repeatedly expressed her solidarity with the Global South, especially Latin America, by participating in an on-the-ground delegation to Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in 2022, and through numerous legislative initiatives focusing on migration and human rights.

The U.S. representative also shared her view that progressives in the U.S., especially those in elected office, have an elevated duty to end U.S. policies that harm people throughout the world, saying, “It is our policies that are actively responsible for sanctions, for militarization, for exploitation, and it is up to us to make sure that we are lifting our voices collectively to say, ‘No, there is another way.'” 

Trump's aggressive approach to relations with his neighbors in the region may have caught many somewhat off guard, but more than six months into his second term, leaders from this hemisphere have now adapted and are forming new united strategies to take on Trump.

At the close of the 2025 Pan-American Congress, delegates reported the discussions and proposals from the various working groups. From efforts to advance an explicit recognition of systemic racism throughout the Americas, to calls for a new global order based on human dignity and solidarity among nations, there was widespread consensus on the need for stronger international cooperation to confront the global rise of fascism, denouncing its role in migrant persecution in the U.S., and the genocide in Gaza.

With the next Pan-American Congress set to take place in Uruguay next year, delegates such as Omar and Tlaib expressed a sense of hope and optimism that the gathering in Mexico City will serve as a turning point. 

“There is nothing like our sisters down south and what they deal with, but [they] continuously find joy in the work that they do on behalf of the communities they serve, and that is inspiring and I'll take that with me,” concluded Omar.

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Contrary to President Trump's claims, eliminating cash bail has made Illinois safer, advocates say.

While announcing plans to send National Guard troops into the country's capital, the Trump administration spread falsehoods about crime in Washington, D.C., as well as legal system measures like Illinois's bail reform.

During his remarks at the White House, Trump claimed that “every place in the country where you have no cash bail is a disaster.” 

“Somebody murders somebody, and they're out on no cash bail before the day is out,” Trump said. “We're going to end that in Chicago.”

In 2021, the Illinois state legislature passed the Pretrial Fairness Act, which eliminated cash bail in the state and replaced it with individual assessments to determine a person's pre-trial conditions. This new system means that “people who pose a threat to their community will not be able to purchase their release,” Allie Preston, a senior policy analyst for the Center for American Progress, wrote in a report on the legislation. 

The overwhelming majority of people involved in the criminal legal system live in poverty, “[a]s a result many people are held in jail on bail amounts as low as $250 or $500,” she wrote.  

“People often must rely on family members and friends to supply bail money, thus spreading the economic impacts across families and communities,” she continued. “It is not uncommon for people to have to forgo paying for electricity, food, or rent to afford bail.” 

After Trump's remarks, the Illinois Network for Pretrial Justice, a coalition of organizations that championed the state's bail reform law, sent out a press release stating that “violent crime has actually significantly decreased since Illinois implemented the Pretrial Fairness Act.” 

“Thanks to Governor Pritzker and our state legislators, Illinois is now safer because money is no longer the primary factor determining who returns to the community and who is jailed while awaiting trial,” the group said. 

Despite Department of Justice data that shows crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low, Trump and members of his administration claimed that crime was rampant in the city, particularly offenses committed by children.

“Our secret weapon here in D.C. is [U.S.] Attorney [for the District of Columbia] Jeanine Pirro, one of the toughest prosecutors and a former judge,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters. “She is going to be talking about juvenile crime, how it's out of control here.” 

Pirro said she sees “too much violent crime being committed by young punks,” and called for harsher punishments for children, contrary to research that shows incarceration causes catastrophic harm to kids and does not make communities safer.

“[O]verwhelming evidence [shows] that incarceration is an ineffective strategy for steering youth away from delinquent behavior and that high rates of youth incarceration do not improve public safety,” according to a report from The Sentencing Project. “Incarceration harms young people's physical and mental health, impedes their educational and career success, and often exposes them to abuse.” 

In order to justify its calls to gut reforms that keep kids out of the adult legal system, the Trump administration misrepresented the prevalence of crime committed by children in the nation's capital. 

In an email to subscribers, Fwd.us, a criminal justice reform group, said: “With the White House announcing the extraordinary step of deploying the National Guard to D.C. to ‘address street crime' despite crime rates being at historic lows, some of the loudest talking points about youth crime are about to dominate headlines again.”

“Here's what the evidence says,” the group continued. “Youth crime is at a historical low. Fewer young people were arrested last summer than in any of the last forty non-pandemic years, and given the declines in crime seen this year, that will probably go down again in 2025.”

Eduardo Ferrer, a law professor at Georgetown University and policy director of the Juvenile Justice Initiative, told Courthouse News that, “youth arrests are well below where they were pre-pandemic.”

“If the federal government wants to help our capital community thrive, it should restore Medicaid cuts, allow D.C. to spend the tax revenue it raised and make us the 51st state,” he said.

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

 Eric Schmidt and Greg Grant

When Russia first launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the conflict drew comparisons to wars of the twentieth century. Tanks, armored personnel carriers, and artillery dominated the battlefield, and both sides' infantry were dug into trenches. We witnessed this old-school style of war when we made our first visit to Ukraine in September 2022. Since then, we have made regular trips to Ukraine, affording us firsthand insight into a monumental transformation: the beginning of a new kind of warfare.

In summer 2023, the commander of Ukraine's Third Assault Brigade's Drone Unit, whom we'll call Fil (not his real name), told us that a new weapon had begun to change the conflict: first-person-view drones. These small, cheap, maneuverable quadcopters transmit real-time footage to their operators and detonate kamikaze-style on their targets. That year, Ukraine flooded the field with thousands of them and Russia soon followed suit. Today, hundreds of thousands of these drones fill the Ukrainian skies.

What began as a war with drones has become a war of drones. Indeed, two years ago, a Ukrainian brigade's strength was judged mostly by its inventory of Western-supplied tanks, armored personnel carriers, and artillery. Since 2023, however, drones have become the most important weapon on the battlefield. Because of their low cost, speed, and precision, drones have now largely supplanted traditional weaponry, including antitank missiles, mortars, tanks, and even artillery and aircraft. Today, a unit's power and resilience are dictated by its number of skilled drone operators and its ability to deploy drones at scale. (One of us, Schmidt, has been a longtime investor in defense technology companies, and is currently an investor in companies supplying drones to Ukraine.)

This represents a profound shift in warfare, largely instigated by Ukraine to compensate for its shortfalls in conventional weapons and manpower. In the world's first drone war, drones determine how battles are won and how soldiers die: Ukrainian drone strikes now account for 90 percent of destroyed Russian tanks and armored vehicles and 80 percent of Russian casualties. They have also made it possible for each side to attack far past the frontlines without having to gain air superiority over the battlefield. Ukraine, for example, hit Russian airbases 5,000 miles from Kyiv in June by smuggling drones across the border and launching them from the beds of trucks.

Russia, for its part, was originally slower to field drones in large numbers. But it has dramatically increased its production of first-person-view drones, as well as those used for strategic bombardment, such as the Iranian-designed Shahed. Today, Moscow matches Kyiv's extraordinary rate of technological adaptation. It has developed equally capable models, such as the Orlan, which is used for surveillance, and the Lancet, which loiters over a target before exploding on impact.

Because Russia and Ukraine are constantly iterating on hardware, software, and tactics, the war changes at a breathtaking rate. The saturation of drone surveillance, for example, has made nearly all troop movement visible and therefore vulnerable, creating a transparent battlefield: anything that moves near the frontline is struck within a matter of minutes. Drone pilots have become prime targets, and with many traditional weapons rendered obsolete, drones are increasingly fighting other drones. Amid this cycle of innovation, the two sides are inching toward a new frontier: entirely automated warfare.

Surveillance and reconnaissance drones have become so ubiquitous that both Russian and Ukrainian forces scarcely move in the daylight. During a recent visit, we witnessed the motion of a single Russian van, five miles from the frontline, cause a sensation among drone operators, who then destroyed it. To avoid detection, movement near the frontline tends to take place during sunrise and sunset, when neither the daylight video cameras nor night-vision infrared cameras operate properly.

The fight for information advantage is always important in war, but even more so in this one, where it means the ability to form and maintain resilient drone-based sensor networks over the battlefield. If a unit is “blinded”—unable to maintain surveillance drones overhead—it becomes exceedingly vulnerable. For that reason, roughly 3,000 Ukrainian troops work around the clock to operate reconnaissance drones, mostly Chinese-made DJI Mavics, along the entire 750-mile frontline. Ukrainian brigade command centers display as many as 60 of these drone feeds around the clock.

This transparency means that the military maxim “what can be seen can be hit” is truer on today's battlefield than at any point in history. It is nearly impossible for either side to mass and maneuver forces along the frontline, as troops are now easily spotted forming up for attack. The Russian army has historically relied on its ability to deliver impressive firepower through concentrated tube and rocket artillery fire, but these tactics are useless when any attempt to amass forces is identified within minutes. Russian guns are now widely dispersed, deeply dug in, and operate primarily at night.



Fil says his team has expanded from 400 troops in 2023 to over 1,000 now, and he expects it to continue to grow in the coming months. The brigade's frontline operations are driven by data, of which there is more every day. Fil's brigade, for example, tracks every engagement, drone mission, and vehicle or piece of equipment hit. That data, in turn, drives decision-making, including over the kinds and quantities of drones to procure. Fil's team spends nearly $2 million each month on small quadcopters, mostly Mavics, for frontline reconnaissance and more than $500,000 per month for longer-range fixed-wing surveillance drones, such as Sharks or Lelekas, that can be used to see much farther from the frontline.

This is expensive, but one new battle tank costs more than $10 million. A tank was long regarded as the best weapon to defeat another tank; now, a first-person-view drone costing less than $800 is, thanks to its ability to strike with precision and move much faster than any ground vehicle. No armored vehicle—no matter its camouflage or anti-drone barriers—can survive for long on the modern, drone-swept battlefield. As a result, Ukrainian soldiers believe tank-led assaults to be suicidal. Russia still launches them occasionally, but most do not make it to the front line.

In response, Russia has shifted primarily to infantry assaults. It is no surprise, then, that more than 75 percent of Ukrainian drones now target infantry. Because surveillance drones have a difficult time spotting scattered infantry in urban terrain and forests, the Russians are deploying small assault groups, typically consisting of five or six teams of two to three people, to simultaneously attack a concentrated area. In recent months, the Russians have turned to motorcycles to more rapidly cross no man's land—a shocking contrast to the line of tanks that rolled toward Kyiv in the earliest days of the conflict. When surviving members of a Russian assault group reach a building, they immediately dig in. Gradually, more soldiers join them. Over days or even weeks, the Russians gather their forces until they judge that they have sufficient strength to make the next bound toward Ukrainian positions. According to an officer from Ukraine's Azov Brigade, Russia's “cheap infantry”—its disregard for soldiers' survival—allows for this kind of constant experimentation.

Because drones have become so important to almost all battlefield operations, destroying them has become critical. Drone-on-drone battle is now a central part of the war. Last year, an estimated 1,200 Russian surveillance drones were operating behind Ukrainian lines on a given day, so Ukraine built the first drone-based air defense system to fend them off. Its forces began using first-person-view drones to chase down larger, slower, and much more expensive surveillance drones. Russian surveillance drones now fly higher to avoid Ukrainian interception. Still, roughly 80 percent of all surveillance drones that cross the frontline, be they Russian or Ukrainian, are shot down by either interceptors or traditional air defenses. Because of these changes, Russia has dramatically reduced its use of Lancet drones. Instead, it has developed smaller, faster, and camouflaged surveillance drones, including some with rear-facing cameras, that let operators spot and evade pursuing drones. 

Unsurprisingly, drone pilots and their control stations have become prime targets for both sides. Fil's unit has found that a successful attack on Russian Mavic operators can pause enemy activity for three days. Because pilots have become such a precious resource, integral to defending the infantry, Ukraine is working to relocate as many of them as possible away from the frontlines to integrated remote operations. In an attempt to further decrease the number of forward-deployed soldiers, Ukraine is now working to establish a so-called drone line along its entire frontline—a layered defense corridor six or seven miles wide, made up of obstacles such as ditches, minefields, and razor wire, and hundreds of drone teams that wait at the ready to destroy any targets before they reach Ukrainian positions. Once this barrier is in place, and more drone functions are automated, far fewer troops will need to defend the frontline. Ukraine hopes that this approach will help alleviate its manpower shortfalls and save lives.

Behind the frontlines, tactics are evolving just as fast. On a nightly basis, Russia launches hundreds of Shahed long-range drones at Ukraine, particularly its major cities. Russia increasingly uses sequenced launches and circuitous route planning so that multiple drones arrive at their target simultaneously from different directions; these attacks amount to manually coordinated “drone swarms.” Short of air defense systems, Ukraine has prioritized the development and production of interceptor drones to counter these swarms. Russia also sends dozens of cheaper “dummy” drones—drones without real capabilities—into Ukrainian airspace, forcing air defense radars to reveal their locations. Russian ballistic and cruise missiles then route around the defenses to strike their targets.

The speed of technological adaptation and iteration—or innovation power—is a new measure of combat strength. The key to adaptation is the lightning-fast feedback loop from operator to engineer. The best Ukrainian drone pilots, therefore, are both tactician and technician, able to make modifications and improvements on the fly.

Consequently, the most important progress in drone development is happening at the front. Operators are supported by research and development labs and manufacturing and repair facilities located near the frontlines. Drone teams constantly test and deploy new radios, antennas, and circuit boards; software updates are pushed out on a near-daily basis. To create an effective weapon now requires adapting and iterating against an equally adaptive adversary, resulting in a highly dynamic contest of action and reaction.

Once a new weapon or technique is introduced to the battlefield, it has a limited window of utility before the opponent develops countermeasures. New kinds of drones appear at a rapid rate: two years ago, the Russian Lancet was the most threatening model. Last year, it was the first-person-view drone. Now, strike drones controlled by fiber-optic cables, first fielded by the Russians, have taken hold of the frontline.

Unlike drones that run on standard radio frequency, these quadcopters spool up to 25 miles of fiber-optic cable in their wake, leaving them hard-wired to their operator. Although these drones are slow and limited by the length of their wire, they are impervious to jamming, relay clear images, and can operate outside radio line of sight, which means that they are well suited for hilly and urban terrain. Since they do not emit radio signals, their pilot's location cannot be identified by electronic means, and they strike with shocking precision.



Fiber-optic drones are effective ambush weapons. Russians fly them across the frontline and park these models on roads or rooftops and wait for passing vehicles. Their high-quality control signal and camera resolution allows them to be maneuvered with pinpoint accuracy into tight areas, such as buildings and bunkers, that normal first-person-view drones, which rely on radio, cannot access. Russia now has elite units of drone pilots using fiber-optic drones stationed along heavily contested parts of the frontline in order to target Ukrainian drone operators, attack enemy supply lines, and ultimately isolate forward units.

Drone innovation is not just about making drones better but also about driving down their cost. Over the course of the past year, both Ukrainian and Russian drone units have replaced the pricey few with the inexpensive plenty. Expensive drones, including the Russian Lancet and the American Switchblade 600, which each cost between $65,000 and $150,000, are being pushed aside in favor of fixed-wing strike drones, such as the Russian Molniya and the Ukrainian Dart, both of which cost less than $3,000. Because Molniya kamikaze drones are so cheap, Russia uses them as a mass strike weapon, sometimes launching 15 at a single target.

For the most part, Ukraine still uses first-person-view drones because they are cheap, relatively easy to use, and readily available. Brigades on the most active fronts consume more than 5,000 of them per month. But because their rate of success in striking a target is low, estimated at no more than ten percent for the average unit, many frontline units favor larger bomber-type drones for their versatility, reusability, and modular configurations. A single Ukrainian-made Vampire hexacopter drone, for example, can drop antitank mines or rain down munitions on enemy infantry, achieving the same effect as dozens of artillery rounds, and with greater precision. And because they are both reusable and have a larger payload than first-person-view drones, bomber drones can saturate the ground with high explosives much more rapidly and at much lower cost. They are also better at targeting infantry when repelling assaults and can collapse buildings with a few accurately placed explosives that would otherwise have taken hundreds of artillery rounds.

Bomber drones can also place mines, a tactic that is quickly becoming one of the most effective ways to halt Russian assaults. Russian units on the attack must use largely predictable routes because of terrain, so Ukrainian forces create a dynamic, mobile minefield by dropping mines in their path. Ukrainian forces then use first-person-view drones to herd Russian vehicles toward the mines. One Ukrainian brigade estimates that 50 percent of enemy vehicle kills in recent months have resulted from drone mining. Ukrainians also use bomber drones to run continuous waves of attacks, similar to artillery bombardments, to keep Russian infantry suppressed, underground, and unable to advance.

Ukraine still employs its legacy systems, such as artillery, to support its drone tactics. When Russian infantry are protecting a valuable target, for instance, Ukrainian troops use artillery to suppress the infantry so that Ukrainian bomber drones can destroy the target without being shot down. Ukrainian troops will also use surveillance drones to ascertain where Russian drone pilots are before shelling those locations. These approaches allow Ukraine to minimize its use of expensive legacy systems that can be difficult to acquire; Russia, by contrast, has less need to adapt its use of these systems because it can afford to expend shells in quantities that Ukraine cannot.

Automating drones with artificial intelligence would solve a variety of problems facing the modern warfighter. A large number of drones are lost to pilot error. And the Ukrainian battlefield is saturated with systems that jam and spoof signals across the electromagnetic spectrum, making it difficult to rely on any technology that requires constant radio connection to a human operator. Thousands of Ukrainian troops operate Mavics all day, every day, a function that could certainly be automated. Collecting and processing surveillance data automatically—ideally from multiple layers of sensors across the frontline—would save hundreds of man-hours a week. And current systems require drone pilots to operate close to the frontline, putting them at risk.

Today, algorithms can augment human control of the battlefield. They reduce error by helping pilots detect, track, approach, and strike targets. AI targeting systems are trained nightly on combat footage to adjust to Russian countermeasures, such as camouflage or decoys. Ukrainian and Western companies are creating software that supports drone pilots even more, by selecting routes, stabilizing flights, navigating to waypoints, recognizing targets, and guiding toward the destination. If these efforts are successful, becoming a drone pilot will require fewer skills and less experience.

In particular, defense firms are keen to develop AI tools that make it easier to carry out the final phase of an attack. The Ukrainian battlefield is a challenge for machine learning because enemy tanks and artillery pieces constantly change appearance with added armor and camouflage. Algorithms also perform poorly at identifying scattered infantry, particularly in dense forests or other complex terrain. AI-assisted target acquisition and terminal guidance have already proved effective even in the face of radio signal jamming. Although the future of fully autonomous drones is unclear, a more autonomous drone strike complex—one that combines reconnaissance and strike drones to identify, track, and hit moving targets—would enormously improve Ukraine's ability to defend against Russian attacks.



Defense companies are also racing to create AI that can coordinate attacks by multiple drones in an automated drone swarm—the holy grail of drone operations. Today, Ukrainian forces can form a carousel of drones over a target to repeatedly strike at it, but doing so requires multiple pilots and operators. With an automated drone swarm, a single pilot could guide many drones, flying independent routes, to overwhelm defenses and saturate a target.

To pull off such a feat, defense firms will need to develop AI-powered systems that enable drones to communicate automatically—not just with one another but also with a host of sensors. These networks exist, but not at the required scale. And the task is getting harder each day: as the drone-versus-drone war escalates, the quantity of drones deployed in each operation will grow from hundreds to thousands, making their automated coordination increasingly difficult.

Eventually, Ukraine will need its own version of Israel's Iron Dome air defense network to protect its cities and factories from Russia's constant drone and missile raids. Of course, Ukraine's vast size makes this a daunting challenge, but it can begin by shielding its major cities. Greater automation will be key to fending off Russian attacks. Whereas the first phase of the war was defined by hardware, with each side competing to invent new kinds of drones, payload, and munitions, the next phase of the war will be determined by software.

Drones have upended the old ways of war. Military doctrine, tactics, and organization will never be the same. Armies everywhere will need to completely revamp their doctrine and training to reflect the realities of fighting on a drone-swept battlefield. And the best way to prepare for the future of combat is to speak to those fighting this war.

Historians often call World War II a “war of factories.” The same is true for the war in Ukraine today. Ukraine produced more than two million drones in 2024 and plans to make over four million by the end of 2025. Its adversary is also getting better at drone production: last year, Russia was building 300 Shahed drones a month. Now, it can produce 5,000 in the same time frame. The side that consistently builds the most drones is the one most likely to prevail. And it is in the interest of the West, and of the United States in particular, to support the Ukrainian people in their dogged determination to win that fight—not only for Ukraine's sake but also for its own, so it can learn to reckon with this new reality of war.

 Alexander Kustov

Growing opposition to immigration is reshaping global politics. A promise to ruthlessly crack down on immigration helped Donald Trump win a return to the White House in 2024. In his first week back in office, Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border. Since then, his administration has ramped up immigration raids on businesses, threatened widespread deportation, and canceled temporary legal status for more than a million people living in the United States. Even as voters have soured somewhat on the administration's extreme tactics, more Americans approve of Trump's immigration policies than they do any of his actions in other areas.

The United States is not an outlier when it comes to public hostility toward immigration. Anti-immigration parties have gained popularity across the globe. Far-right parties, which often base their appeal on bashing immigrants and calling for tighter border controls, are now the most popular political force in Europe. Even center-left governments, such as that of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, have felt obliged to embrace hard-line immigration measures out of fear of losing further ground to the surging far right.

Defenders of immigration often argue that they have both the facts and the morals on their side. Immigration is not a zero-sum game: more immigration can boost local and national economies while improving the fortunes of people seeking better lives. Immigration advocates blame racial prejudice or misinformation for opposition to immigration and point to demagoguery that scapegoats vulnerable immigrants for economic and social problems. Although prejudice and ignorance likely play some role in shaping attitudes—and elite politicians are powerful forces in driving public opinion—the fact is that many citizens have genuine concerns about immigration that cannot be ignored. These include practical worries about whether the state can maintain order, promote fair job competition, and ensure that housing and public services do not become overstretched.

But these concerns do not mean that the only viable immigration policy is one that is as harsh as it is cruel. Finding a better political solution must start with understanding what drives public backlash to immigration. Many citizens are deeply troubled by mismanaged flows of people into their country. This concern stems from a failure of policy, not of messaging. Until decision-makers craft more targeted immigration policy that straightforwardly focuses on how immigrants can provide economic benefits, anti-immigrant attitudes and parties will continue to gain ground.

Most observers believe that governments should be more responsive to voters on immigration, but they often fail to understand what the public wants. One popular approach to addressing the anti-immigrant backlash is to set numerical targets, such as the United Kingdom's goal of reducing “net migration.” This reflects a tendency to think of immigration as a numbers game. If governing parties assume that voters simply want fewer immigrants, they pursue policies to limit overall immigration. But research shows that even when mainstream politicians embrace hard-line positions such as capping the number of new immigrants, they still fail to win over disaffected voters.

In fact, few people care about immigration numbers in the abstract. Research shows that there is no correlation between public opposition to immigration and actual immigration levels. Small inflows have sparked intense controversy even in cosmopolitan places—as happened, for example, with the arrival of tens of thousands of asylum seekers in New York City in 2022. By contrast, far larger waves, such as the European Union's reception of millions of Ukrainians after Russia's 2022 invasion or Israel's acceptance of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe after the fall of the Soviet Union, drew less resistance. The lack of direct connection between public attitudes and numbers of immigrants also helps explain why people living in areas with relatively few immigrants can still strongly oppose immigration when the issue is salient nationally.

The vast majority of voters in rich democracies don't have especially fixed views on immigration across the board. Only ten to 20 percent of voters seek to either shut borders completely or open them to all comers. For everyone else, views on immigration depend on whether they believe the new arrivals will benefit the country and the specific details of immigration policies. If voters perceive new immigrants as helpful to their community and the country at large, they are likely to support more immigration and reject strict anti-immigration politics.

In other words, voters assess immigration not on whether it affects them personally, but on how it affects society. In my research, I found that citizens in the United Kingdom opposed immigration if they believed it harmed their fellow citizens. But they were willing to countenance new immigrants if they felt the country as a whole would be better off. Data from other countries reveals similar patterns: survey respondents presented with policies designed to benefit the country's economy, such as attracting immigrants to fill labor shortages, are more likely to support them. A large majority of people in the United States—including Trump supporters who cheer on his harsh immigration crackdowns—favor attracting new high-skilled professionals who can help maintain the United States' technological edge.

But the incoherence of current immigration polices has generated widespread distrust and opposition to immigration in the United States. This is not just a problem of unconvincing rhetoric. Rather, the immigration system is so convoluted and mismanaged that few people believe that immigration can possibly help the country thrive. Congress is stuck in a perpetual cycle of trying to broker a grand bipartisan solution of trading pathways to citizenship for border security, which then fails to satisfy anyone. The immigration system has become so broken—and immigration debates so toxic—that it can be hard for any voter to imagine how immigration could be in the U.S. public interest.

In an ideal world, citizens would accurately perceive the exact benefits of an immigration policy on society. Or, with enough rhetorical swagger, a charismatic pro-immigration politician could provide them with facts that would convince them to support immigration policies whose benefits outweigh the costs to society. Unfortunately, politics is never so simple. But better designed policies can help build support for immigration.

Examples from a variety of wealthy democracies suggest that immigration policies focused on addressing a host country's economic needs are more likely to win support than immigration policies rooted in humanitarian concerns. Consider Sweden, where far-right anti-immigration parties have swelled in response to recent waves of immigration. In the last few decades, Sweden has welcomed hundreds of thousands of refugees and their relatives without considering income or skills. Policymakers have provided generous support to newcomers as part of the country's long-standing commitment to asylum and equality. Before 2000, Sweden did not even count immigration for work as a separate category in its immigration statistics.

The uncomfortable fact is that foreign-born people in Sweden, many of whom arrived as asylum seekers, on average pay less in taxes than the state spends on benefits to support them. These recent arrivals have stoked social tensions and raised concerns about the growing strain on the welfare state. Widely publicized violent incidents in immigrant neighborhoods became national flashpoints, which the public linked to a failure to integrate new immigrants into Swedish society. The sense that the immigration system is not working has fueled the rise of the Swedish Democrats, a far-right party, since the 2010s.



To be sure, economists have argued that accepting even low-skilled immigrants typically has knock-on effects that contribute to economic growth and benefit society. Immigrants can fill essential jobs and push native-born workers into higher-paying positions. They can help revive depressed communities in rural or post-industrial areas. But most voters cannot see these benefits, which, if they occur, are widely spread out and become evident only many years later.

Canada, by contrast, has built a system that admits large numbers of immigrants but is selective in doing so. To attract needed workers, the Canadian government uses a points-based approach that prioritizes people with rare or sought-after skills. Immigrants are admitted largely based on what they can contribute to society in the near term. The immigration process uses transparent criteria, such as education or regional demand for workers, which most voters can understand.

This policy has been remarkably successful. Canada has one of the highest immigration rates per capita in the world. Although some citizens have expressed vocal concerns about housing strain and student visa abuse, the Canadian government has moved swiftly to tighten immigration oversight and recalibrate admissions to maintain the trust of voters who still generally feel that the immigration system works for the country. As a result, anti-immigrant demagogues have gained little traction in national politics.

Determining who can immigrate based on a points rubric or where workers are needed may seem cold and unfeeling in the face of the deeply human imperatives that drive international migration. But such a policy is the only viable path to a more open immigration system. As my research shows, no democracy has ever managed to ease widespread immigration concerns without being very selective about whom to admit. Cross-national data also reveals that more selective countries such as Canada are admitting more immigrants of all kinds. In other words, Canada's experience shows that when immigration policies are demonstrably aligned with national needs, they build public goodwill that can later extend to more vulnerable newcomers, including refugees.

A points-based system to admit “the best and brightest” is just one of many possible policies that can make immigration popular. Any policy that primarily focuses on solving visible national problems while signaling control of population flows is likely to make the public feel good about immigration, while those that explicitly sideline citizens' interests are more likely to spur backlash, resentment, and populism. Immigration policies that focus on filling labor shortages, revitalizing struggling regions, or supporting family reunification of immediate relatives can all win public support.

Some politicians will always seek to exploit immigration anxieties, exaggerate problems, and spread misinformation. But it is easier to do in Sweden than in Canada. This isn't because Canadians are more tolerant, nor is it because their leaders have found the perfect communication strategy to sway the population. Rather, it's because voters can see that Canadian immigration policies work. The more that democratic governments take public concerns seriously and craft immigration policies that clearly benefit society in ways people can understand, the less space there is for xenophobic populists to claim that only they have the country's interests at heart.

Responsible democratic governments serious about making immigration politically viable must also be willing to compromise. Immigration debates are often framed in binary terms—open versus closed, pro-immigration versus anti-immigration, nationalist versus cosmopolitan. But real solutions lie in which types of immigration policies countries pursue. Work-oriented policies, rather than humanitarian-based ones, are more likely to command broad support. Sweden has finally begun moving in this direction by introducing more selective immigration criteria. Inspired by Canada, Germany has also adopted its own version of a points-based immigration system; in 2024, the country issued ten percent more skilled worker visas than the year prior.



Implementing a points-based system will not solve all problems, however. How such a system is designed matters for its success. Many so-called merit-based proposals—such as some of those Republicans have proposed in the U.S. Senate in the past decade—will not help if their primary aim is to find a new way to cut overall admissions. Instead, what builds public support is an immigration policy visibly tied to labor demand, immediate work authorization for new arrivals, and publicly reported benefits of immigration that voters can understand.

Advanced democracies could also adopt immigration policies tied to demonstrable regional needs. For instance, U.S. states could issue visas for workers who have the skills to meet a labor shortfall they face, such as licensed nurses for understaffed hospitals in Michigan or eldercare aides in Minnesota. These policies are most effective when visas are designed to be portable across approved local employers and the policies lay out a path to permanent status for workers after a period of sustained employment. Canada's Provincial Nominee Program and Australia's Regional Visa program are examples that can serve as models for U.S. policymakers.

Similarly, governments can establish bilateral employment partnerships to fast-track visas or permanent residency status for workers from a specific country with relevant skills. These partnerships can apply to fields with national labor shortages, such as eldercare, construction, engineering, or artificial intelligence. Australia and South Korea have established effective regional programs that prepare and train workers from other countries and then match them to verified jobs with wage floors.

These types of targeted, narrow immigration policies can help voters recognize immigration's benefits to their country. The logic is the same as for dedicated taxes: voters often support tax increases when they know exactly how their tax money will be used. Voters do not necessarily want less immigration; they want immigration that they can see working. When citizens see immigration policies that are effective—bringing in doctors at understaffed hospitals, entrepreneurs who create jobs, or caregivers who support aging populations—they also see their own communities benefiting.

The fact that targeted, well-managed immigration policies are more popular than purely humanitarian approaches does not preclude helping those in need. But efforts to assist refugees and displaced people must also demonstrate their benefits to society to avoid backlash. Governments are more likely to gain public support when they strictly enforce immigration rules, quickly provide accepted refugees with the right to work, match them to open jobs, and expand the role of communities and private companies in sponsoring new arrivals. When willing citizens and employers share the costs, everyone—including politicians, workers, and even asylum seekers—can also share in the benefits.

            Hours before President Donald Trump fired former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Erika McEntarfer this month, E.J. Antoni appeared on former White House strategist Steve Bannon's podcast to discuss the BLS' monthly jobs report, which showed much-lower-than-expected numbers for July and shockingly steep revisions for May and June.
    


            Antoni called McEntarfer “incompetent” for failing to fix data collection and interpretation problems at the BLS that have led to major revisions in recent years. He agreed with Bannon on the solution: A MAGA Republican who “Trump knows and trusts” should be put into the position.
    


            “We still haven't gotten there,” Antoni said of a Trump loyalist running the BLS. “And I think that's part of the reason why we continue to have all of these different data problems.”
    


            On Monday, Antoni became that trusted ally when Trump nominated him to become the new commissioner for the BLS. It's the latest example of Trump's appointment of loyalists to otherwise nonpartisan or independent agencies. Some of those appointments have worked to radically reshape the institutions they were chosen to lead.
    


            BLS, an independently operated agency within the Department of Labor, collects and publishes crucial data on jobs and inflation used by businesses, investors and governments. Antoni, an economist at the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation and contributor to Project 2025, has been an outspoken critic of the way BLS collects that data.
    


            “There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data—that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years,” Antoni posted on X last week.
    


            In particular, Antoni has criticized the BLS for failing to capture sufficient and prompt data in the post-pandemic era. By law, except in a handful of states and Puerto Rico, participation in the survey for the monthly jobs report is voluntary. But survey response rates have tumbled since Covid – from 60% in January 2020 to less than 43% for the April 2025 report.
    


            Antoni has also echoed a frequent Trump criticism of the BLS, claiming that recent massive annual revisions – including a revision that showed 589,000 fewer jobs were created in 2024 than initially reported – gave former President Joe Biden favorable headlines each month that critics say he didn't deserve.
    


            “Under the Biden administration … we routinely got a great number – a blockbuster number – initially, and then in the subsequent months that number would be revised down, and then when it was time for an annual revision, the figures would be revised down further. In other words, millions of jobs that we thought we had, it turns out were never there in the first place,” Antoni said in July on “The Right Idea,” a Texas Publicly Policy Foundation podcast. “Of course, no one pays attention to the revisions months later, so it always is just that blockbuster headline and then quietly revising those numbers down.”
    


            That revision was not a record, as Trump has falsely claimed: A 902,000-job revision in 2009 was larger. The BLS said the difference between the initial and final annual revisions last year was due to information received in US tax returns.
    


            Antoni called post-pandemic economic data “highly problematic.” The BLS has warned cuts issued by the Department of Government Efficiency have disrupted the data collection that feeds into the government's reports. Yet Antoni has applauded the work by DOGE in cutting government jobs.
    


            His criticisms of the BLS go back years. In a 2022 blog post, he called a methodology change for the BLS' Consumer Price Index an “Orwellian trick” to mask higher inflation.
    


            Antoni is a favorite of conservatives and makes frequent appearances on right-wing media outlets. In addition to his work at the Heritage Foundation and the Texas Public Policy Foundation, he is an opinion columnist for the Daily Caller and guest on Bannon's show.
    


            The Heritage Foundation praised Trump's selection of Antoni to run the BLS.
    


            “EJ Antoni is one of the sharpest economic minds in the nation—a fearless truth-teller who grasps that sound economics must serve the interests of American families, not globalist elites,” said Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, in a statement. “I can confidently say that his nomination as the next commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics is a stellar choice by President Trump.”
    


            But Trump's firing of McEntarfer and nominating of Antoni have been met with swift backlash from many economists, who worry about the credibility and non-partisan nature of the bureau. Trump accused McEntarfer – who was appointed by former President Joe Biden to the role of commissioner in 2023 and confirmed by a bipartisan Senate vote – of manipulating jobs data without offering any evidence.
    


            “E.J. Antoni is completely unqualified to be BLS Commissioner. He is an extreme partisan and does not have any relevant expertise. He would be a break from decades of nonpartisan technocrats,” economist Jason Furman posted on X.
    


            Another economist, Justin Wolfers, called Antoni “disastrously terrible” and wrote that he has “few credentials beyond a long history of misrepresenting or misunderstanding basic economic statistics.”
    


            CNN has reached out to Antoni for comment.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine military on Tuesday blamed China for the collision of two Chinese navy and coast guard ships while trying to drive the Philippine coast guard and fishermen from a disputed shoal in the South China Sea. It said it would assess how to respond to Beijing's use of military force against civilians.

Philippine authorities said Monday's accidental collision resulted in visibly heavy damages to the Chinese coast guard and navy ships and possible injuries.

The confrontation near the Scarborough Shoal was the latest flare-up of the long-simmering territorial standoff in the contested waters, a long-feared flashpoint in Asia.

The United States, a longtime treaty ally of the Philippines, on Tuesday condemned the “latest reckless action by China directed against a Philippine vessel.”

The Chinese coast guard on Monday blamed Philippine vessels for the confrontation and said it was forced to expel the vessels after they intruded into “China's inherent territory,” despite warnings. It did not mention the collision or possible casualties.

Video footage made public by the Philippine coast guard shows a Chinese navy ship with the bow number 164 slamming into the bow of a Chinese coast guard ship while both try to block and force a Philippine patrol ship, the BRP Suluan, away from Scarborough. The Chinese coast guard ship can be seen using its water cannon.

The video shows the heavily shattered bow of the Chinese coast guard ship, where at least two Chinese personnel were seen standing shortly before the crash. The Chinese navy ship sustained deep dents and what appeared to be linear cuts on its hull.

BRP Suluan offered medical help by two-way radio to the Chinese coast guard, fearing the collision may have caused injuries to its personnel, but the Philippine coast guard said it received no response.




Gan Yu, a spokesperson for the Chinese coast guard in Beijing, said Monday that the Philippine vessels intruded into Chinese territorial waters off the shoal, prompting its forces to take “necessary measures, including monitoring, forcing, intercepting and controlling the Philippine vessels to expel them.”

The chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr., told reporters in Manila that the video footage clearly showed that the Chinese navy ship maneuvered to ram the BRP Suluan, which had to move to avoid being hit. As a result, the Chinese navy ship instead hit the Chinese coast guard ship, which was also closely chasing the Philippine vessel, Brawner said.

“China's aggressive actions were very clear in this incident,” Brawner said. “They were at fault because of their aggressive maneuvers. We were there to protect Filipino fishermen in the Scarborough Shoal. That was our only objective because that's our traditional fishing ground.”

Asked if China's deployment of military force against civilians was a change in tactic, Brawner said it was. He said the Philippine military would assess how to respond in consultation with the coast guard and would seek guidance from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.

“Now they are deploying their PLA navy, and this is one symbol of China's aggressiveness,” he said, referring to China's People's Liberation Army. “We'll discuss possible steps and our future tactics to counter China's actions to stop us from getting access (to Scarborough).”

Chinese officials did not immediately comment on Brawner's statement but Gan Yu insisted its forces would be “resolutely safeguarding China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.”

Hours after Paramount and UFC announced a billion-dollar rights deal, Dana White said he had yet to hear from his friend, President Donald Trump, on his thoughts about the fight company's new streaming home.

That was fine with White. The UFC CEO was set to travel to Washington on Aug. 28 to meet with Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, to catch up and discuss logistics on the proposed Fourth of July fight card next year at the White House.

Trump said last month he wanted to stage a UFC match on the White House grounds with upwards of 20,000 spectators to celebrate 250 years of American independence.

“It's absolutely going to happen,” White told The Associated Press. “Think about that, the 250th birthday of the United States of America, the UFC will be on the White House south lawn live on CBS.”

The idea of cage fights at the White House would have seemed improbable when the Fertitta brothers purchased UFC for $2 million in 2001 and put White in charge of the fledging fight promotion.

White helped steer the company into a $4 billion sale in 2016 and broadcast rights deals with Fox and ESPN before landing owner TKO Group's richest one yet — a seven-year deal with Paramount starting in 2026 worth an average of $1.1 billion a year, with all cards on its streaming platform Paramount+ and select numbered events also set to simulcast on CBS.

ESPN, Amazon and Netflix and other traditional sports broadcast players seemed more in play for UFC rights — White had previously hinted fights could air across different platforms — but Paramount was a serious contender from the start of the negotiating window.




The Paramount and UFC deal came just days after Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger — kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line. White said he was impressed with the vision Skydance CEO David Ellison had for the the global MMA leader early in contract talks and how those plans should blossom now that Ellison is chairman and CEO of Paramount.

“When you talk about Paramount, you talk about David Ellison, they're brilliant businessmen, very aggressive, risk takers,” White said. “They're right up my alley. These are the kind of guys that I like to be in business with.”

The $1.1 billion deals marks a notable jump from the roughly $550 million that ESPN paid each year for UFC coverage today. But UFC's new home on Paramount will simplify offerings for fans — with all content set to be available on Paramount+ (which currently costs between $7.99 and $12.99 a month), rather than various pay-per-view fees.

Paramount also said it intends to explore UFC rights outside the U.S. “as they become available in the future.”

UFC matchmakers were set to meet this week to shape what White said would be a loaded debut Paramount card. The UFC boss noted it was still too early to discuss a potential main event for the White House fight night.

“This is a 1-of-1 event,” White said.

There are still some moving parts to UFC broadcasts and other television programming it has its hands in as the company moves into the Paramount era. White said there are still moving parts to the deal and that includes potentially finding new homes for “The Ultimate Fighter,” “Road To UFC,” and “Dana White's Contender Series.” It's not necessarily a given the traditional 10 p.m. start time for what were the pay-per-view events would stand, especially on nights cards will also air on CBS.

“We haven't figured that out yet but we will,” White said.

And what about the sometimes-contentious issue of fighter pay? Some established fighters have clauses in their contracts that they earn more money the higher the buyrate on their cards. Again, most of those issues are to-be-determined as UFC and Paramount settle in to the new deal — with $1.1 billion headed the fight company's way.

“It will affect fighter pay, big time,” White said. “From deal-to-deal, fighter pay has grown, too. Every time we win, everybody wins.”

Boxer Jake Paul wrote on social media the dying PPV model — which was overpriced for fights as UFC saw a decline in buys because of missing star power in many main events — should give the fighters an increased idea of their worth.

“Every fighter in the UFC now has a clear picture of what the revenue is...no more PPV excuses,” Paul wrote. “Get your worth boys and girls.”

White also scoffed at the idea that the traditional PPV model is dead.

There are still UFC cards on pay-per-view the rest of the year through the end of the ESPN contract and White and Saudi Arabia have teamed to launch a new boxing venture that starts next year and could use a PPV home. White, though, is part of the promotional team for the Canelo Álvarez and Terence Crawford fight in September in Las Vegas that airs on Netflix.

“It's definitely not run it's course,” White said. “There were guys out there who were interested in pay-per-view and there were guys out there that weren't. Wherever we ended up, that's what we're going to roll with.”

White said UFC archival footage “kills it” in repeat views and those classic bouts also needed a new home once the ESPN deal expires.

Just when it seems there's little left for UFC to conquer, White says, there's always more. Why stop at becoming the biggest fight game in the world? Why not rewrite the pecking order in popularity and riches and go for No. 1 in all sports?

“You have the NFL, the NBA, the UFC, and soccer globally,” White said. “We're coming. We're coming for all of them.”

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A peace deal that requires Kyiv to accept swapping Ukrainian territory with Russia would not only be deeply unpopular. It also would be illegal under its constitution.

That's why President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has categorically rejected any deal with Moscow that could involve ceding land after U.S. President Donald Trump suggested such a concession would be beneficial to both sides, ahead of his meeting Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.

Zelenskyy said over the weekend that Kyiv “will not give Russia any awards for what it has done,” and that “Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.” The remarks came after Trump said a peace deal would involve swapping of Ukrainian territories by both sides “to the betterment of both.”

For Zelenskyy, such a deal would be disaster for his presidency and spark public outcry after more than three years of bloodshed and sacrifice by Ukrainians. Moreover, he doesn't have the authority to sign off on it, because changing Ukraine's 1991 borders runs counter to the country's constitution. 

AP correspondent Harriet Morris reports it is an open question whether Friday's US-Russia summit in Alaska can lead to a deal to produce peace in Ukraine, after more than 3 1/2 years of fighting.

For now, freezing the front line appears to be an outcome the Ukrainian people are willing to accept.




A look at the challenges such proposals entail:

Russia occupies about a fifth of Ukraine, from the country's northeast to the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed illegally in 2014.




The front line is vast and cuts across six regions — the active front stretches for at least 1,000 kilometers (680 miles) — but if measured from along the border with Russia, it reaches as far as 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles).

Russia controls almost all of the Luhansk region and almost two-thirds of Donetsk region, which together comprise the Donbas, as the strategic industrial heartland of Ukraine is called. Russia has long coveted the area and illegally annexed it in the first year of the full-scale invasion, even though it didn't control much of it at the time.

Russia also partially controls more than half of the Kherson region, which is critical to maintain logistical flows of supplies coming in from the land corridor in neighboring Crimea, and also parts of the Zaporizhzhia region, where the Kremlin seized Europe's largest nuclear power plant.

Russian forces also hold pockets of territory in Kharkiv and Sumy regions in northeastern Ukraine, far less strategically valuable for Moscow. Russian troops are gaining a foothold in the Dnipropetrovsk region. These could be what Moscow is willing to exchange for land it deems more important in Donetsk, where the Russian army has concentrated most of its effort.

“There'll be some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody. To the good, for the good of Ukraine. Good stuff, not bad stuff. Also, some bad stuff for both,” Trump said Monday.

Ukrainian forces are still active in the Kursk region inside Russia, but they barely hold any territory there, making it not as potent a bargaining chip as Kyiv's leaders had probably hoped when they launched the daring incursion across the border last year. Swapping Ukrainian controlled territory in Russia, however minuscule, will likely be the only palatable option for Kyiv in any land swapping scenario.

Surrendering territory would see those unwilling to live under Russian rule to pack up and leave. Many civilians have endured so much suffering and bloodshed since pro-Moscow forces began battling the Ukrainian military in the east in 2014 and since the full-scale invasion in 2022.

From a military standpoint, abandoning the Donetsk region in particular would vastly improve Russia's ability to invade Ukraine again, according to the Washington-based think tank Institute for the Study of War.

Bowing to such a demand would force Ukraine to abandon its “fortress belt,” the main defensive line in Donetsk since 2014, “with no guarantee that fighting will not resume,” the institute said in a recent report.

The regional defensive line has prevented Russia's efforts to seize the region and continues to impede Russia's efforts to take the rest of the area, ISW said.

Ukraine's constitution poses a major challenge to any deal involving a land swap because it requires a nationwide referendum to approve changes to the country's territorial borders, said Ihor Reiterovych, a politics professor in the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv.

“Changes in territorial integrity can be done only by the decision of the people — not the president, the cabinet of ministers or the parliament can change it,” he said. “In the constitution it is written that only by referendum can changes to Ukraine's territory be conducted.”

If during negotiations Zelenskyy agrees to swap territory with Russia, “in the same minute he will be a criminal because he would be abandoning the main law that governs Ukraine,” Reiterovych said.

Trump said he was “a little bothered” by Zelenskyy's assertion over the weekend that he needed constitutional approval to cede to Russia the territory that it captured in its unprovoked invasion.

“I mean, he's got approval to go into a war and kill everybody, but he needs approval to do a land swap?” Trump added. ”Because there'll be some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody.”

Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., brought a copy of her country's constitution to her interview on Sunday with CBS' “Face the Nation,” and described how the president is “the guarantor of the constitution” and cannot give away land under Article 133.

Zelenskyy is still trying to regain the people's trust that was damaged when he reversed course on a law that would have diminished the independence of Ukraine's anti-corruption watchdogs. The move was a red line for those citizens who are protective of the country's institutions and are suspicious of certain members of Zelenskyy's inner circle.

Analysts like Reiterovych dismiss a land swap as a distraction. Freezing the conflict along the current front line is the only option Ukrainians are willing to accept, he said, citing recent polls. 

This option would also buy time for both sides to consolidate manpower and build up their domestic weapons industries. Ukraine would require strong security guarantees from its Western partners to deter future Russian aggression, which Kyiv believes is inevitable.

Still, freezing the conflict will also be difficult for Ukrainians to accept.

Along with the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the partial occupation of Luhansk and Donetsk after that, it would require accepting that the Ukrainian military is not able to retake lost territories militarily. Kyiv accepted its inability to retake these territories but never formally recognized them as Russian. A similar scenario could unfold in the new regions taken by Russian forces.

It also is not a viable long-term solution.

“It is the lesser evil option for everyone and it will not provoke protests or rallies on the streets,” Reiterovych said.

Some of the 800 National Guard members deployed by President Donald Trump began arriving in Washington D.C. on Tuesday, ramping up after the White House ordered federal forces to take over the city's police department and reduce crime in what the president called — without substantiation — a lawless city.

The law lets Trump control the police department for a month, but how aggressive the federal presence will be remains an open question. 

Following a meeting with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Tuesday morning, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser emphasized that the Metropolitan Police Department will retain its independence, including over hiring and firing, saying “our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, none of that has changed.”

“We have more police, and we want to make sure we use them,” Bowser added. The remarks marked a change in tone from Monday when Bowser called Trump's executive order “unsettling and unprecedented.”

Other news we're following today:








Leavitt says Trump's goal for his meeting with Putin this week is “to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war.”

The White House press secretary downplayed the president's aims for the summit on Friday in Alaska. She described the meeting as “a listening exercise for the president” that he agreed to after Putin requested a meeting.

Leavitt declined to discuss Trump's conversations with Zelenskyy but said Trump has “deep respect” for all parties.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says approximately 850 federal law enforcement officers were deployed in Washington and made 23 arrests overnight.

Leavitt says the arrests include charges of homicide, gun and drug crimes, reckless driving, fare evasion and drunken driving.Leavitt said six illegal handguns were seized.

“This is only the beginning,” she said, pledging that federal authorities would continue policing in the nation's capital for a month.

“President Trump will not be deterred by soft on crime democrats and media activists,” Leavitt said

“THIS IS YOUR SECOND-TO-LAST WARNING!!!” Newsom's press office wrote Tuesday in a X post urging the president to back off efforts to redraw congressional maps.

California Democrats are planning to introduce new partisan maps on Friday to counter efforts to help GOPs in 2026 in Texas.

“STAND DOWN NOW OR CALIFORNIA WILL COUNTER-STRIKE (LEGALLY!) TO DESTROY YOUR ILLEGAL CROOKED MAPS IN RED STATES,” the post reads.

The new maps in California would still need state lawmakers and voters approval. State Republicans vow to challenge the effort.

The Swiss Association of Precious Metals Manufacturers and Traders on Tuesday said it was awaiting a formal decision after Trump wrote “Gold will not be Tariffed!” on his Truth Social platform late Monday.

“President Trump's statement is an encouraging signal for trade stability,” said Christoph Wild, the president of the association, which counts 15 companies that process and trade in precious metals like gold. “However, only a formal and binding decision will provide the certainty the gold sector and its partners require.”

The Swiss National Bank, citing figures from the Swiss government, in April issued a report saying that gold refineries in Switzerland supply about one-third of refined gold worldwide.

Last year, gold accounted for some 27% of goods trade value from the country, making it Switzerland's most-traded product — ahead of pharmaceuticals at 22%, the SNB said.

The precious metals association, known as ASFCMP, last week expressed concern following news reports and other indications that the Trump administration might apply whopping 39% U.S. tariffs on Swiss products -- among the highest it has imposed anywhere -- to gold products. 






Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser says the city will aim to “make the most of” the increase in federal resources in the city after Trump's announcement that he's taking over Washington's police department and activating 800 members of the National Guard.

Bowser also emphasized that the Metropolitan Police Department will retain its independence, including over hiring and firing, saying “our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, none of that has changed.”

“We have more police, and we want to make sure we use them,” Bowser added after a meeting with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.

The remarks mark a change in tone from Monday when Bowser called Trump's executive order “unsettling and unprecedented.”

Pamela Smith, chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, spoke about reduced crime in the city and said increased federal resources “will only help us build upon that.”

Bondi called the meeting with Bowser “productive” in a statement on X, adding that the Justice Department will work closely with city government and police.

Last year, a federal court ordered Alabama to use a new congressional map, which put Moore's home outside his own district. Rather than moving to seek his old seat, he opted to challenge his fellow GOP incumbent in a hard-fought primary for the more solidly Republican 1st District.

Now he's seeking the position being vacated by Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who's running for governor. The rare open Senate seat is expected to draw a number of candidates and Alabama's Republican attorney general has already entered the race.

The federal judge ordered the administration to stop withholding funding approved by Congress for the nonprofit that aims to strengthen democratic institutions around the world.

U.S. Judge Dabney Friedrich in Washington said Monday it was clear the State Department was blocking the money for “impermissible policy reasons,” and she rejected the department's explanation that it was trying to ensure the endowment had funding for the upcoming year.

“Before and during litigation, the defendants obstructed routine drawdown requests on money already set aside in the Endowment's Treasury account, imposed and then abandoned a novel waiver requirement, and delayed the obligation of apportioned funds,” she wrote. “These actions vitiate any inference that the defendants' concern has been to ‘ensure' the Endowment's ‘level of funding in the coming fiscal year.'”

Friedrich granted a preliminary injunction sought by the endowment for its remaining 2025 funding — $95 million, or about a third of its annual funding.

The State Department did not immediately have comment.

A Justice Department investigation concluded that leaders of George Washington University were “deliberately indifferent” to complaints of antisemitism stemming from pro-Palestinian protests last year.

In a Tuesday letter to the university's president, the Justice Department said George Washington violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by failing to address the harassment of Jewish students amid a campus tent encampment. The department said it will pursue enforcement action unless the university agrees to a voluntary resolution agreement.

The university did not immediately comment.

The Trump administration has issued similar findings at Harvard, Columbia and the University of California, Los Angeles. The government has used a deal with Columbia as a template for agreements with other universities.

The tent encampment at George Washington lasted about two weeks starting in April 2024 before it was cleared by police.

It's a closely watched appointment by the two-term governor, who can't run for reelection in 2026 and has been working to cement his legacy as his time leading the state winds down.

If Collins, an Army combat veteran and nonprofit executive, decides to launch a bid to succeed DeSantis, the move could tee up another proxy fight between the popular GOP governor and President Trump, who's already endorsed U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds for the job.

During a Tuesday news conference announcing his pick, DeSantis praised Collins for having strong conservative principles.

Collins was then sworn in minutes after the announcement.

The seat had been vacant since February, when then-lieutenant governor Jeanette Nuñez was appointed to lead one of the state's public universities.

That's according to a White House official.

The Europeans hope to use the Wednesday meeting to rally Trump to Ukraine's cause ahead of his Friday summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Trump has disappointed allies in Europe by saying Ukraine will have to give up some Russian-held territory. He also said Russia must accept land swaps, although it was unclear what Putin might be expected to surrender.

Trump said Monday he's “going to get everybody's ideas” before meeting with Putin.

The White House is holding off on publicly releasing the much-anticipated “MAHA” strategy report that's supposed to provide a policy road map for making Americans healthier.

The policy recommendations are a follow up from the MAHA report released in May, which focused on ultraprocessed foods, prescription drugs, vaccines, screentime and pesticides.

The initial report had already divided some conservatives, with farmers concerned about its focus on pesticides and some from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s coalition upset that the report didn't call for a ban on those chemicals.

White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that the report is “on track” to be submitted to President Trump on Tuesday and will be unveiled to the public “shortly thereafter.”

The attorney general is expected to meet Tuesday with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser a day after the president put the city's police force under federal control.

Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith was also seen entering Justice Department headquarters ahead of the planned meeting.

Trump said Monday that Bondi would assume responsibility for the police department in the hopes of reducing crime, even as city officials stressed crime is already falling.

Trump called Fed chair Jerome Powell a “loser” Tuesday and demanded that he cut the central bank's short-term interest rate. Such rate reductions can, over time, reduce borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and business loans.

Trump also said he might allow a “major lawsuit” to proceed against the Fed over the burgeoning cost of its massive renovation of two office buildings, currently expected to cost $2.5 billion, up from a previous estimate of $1.9 billion. It's not clear what lawsuit Trump was referring to.

It was unclear whether even Ukraine will take part in the summit. Trump has said he wants to see whether Russian leader Vladimir Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year.

Trump has disappointed allies in Europe by saying Ukraine will have to give up some Russian-held territory. He also said Russia must accept land swaps, although it was unclear what Putin might be expected to surrender.

The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia's energy might to try to intimidate the EU, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them.

It comes after data suggested inflation across the country was a touch better last month than economists expected.

The S&P 500 rose 0.6% and was on track to top its all-time high set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 251 points, or 0.6%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was 0.7% higher and also heading toward a record.

Stocks got a lift from hopes that the better-than-expected inflation report will give the Federal Reserve more leeway to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September.

Lower rates would give a boost to investment prices and to the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment. President Trump has angrily been calling for cuts to help the economy, often insulting the Fed's chair personally while doing so.

Trump announced the nod Monday, noting Jones was among the first Georgia Republicans to endorse Trump's first bid for the White House in 2016 and saying Jones “worked tirelessly to help us win” in all three of Trump's bids.

“He has been with us from the very beginning,” Trump wrote on social media. “I know his family well and have seen Burt tested at the most difficult levels and times.”

Republicans including Attorney General Chris Carr are vying with Jones to be their party's nominee to succeed Gov. Brian Kemp, who can't run again because of term limits. Other Republican candidates who could enter the race include Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.

National Guard troops are beginning to arrive at the Washington, D.C., armory. They were seen arriving this morning at the Guard's headquarters in the city.

Trump said Monday that in hopes of reducing crime, he would be taking over Washington's police department and activating 800 members of the National Guard. The crime Trump talked about is the same crime that city officials stress is already falling noticeably.

The Republican president, who had himself installed as chairman of the Kennedy Center's board, said in a social media post that the to-be-named nominees are “GREAT.”

“GREAT Nominees for the TRUMP/KENNEDY CENTER, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, AWARDS,” Trump wrote in a social media post. “They will be announced Wednesday.

“Tremendous work is being done, and money being spent, on bringing it back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment,” he said, without offering details.

The Kennedy Center Honors program typically tapes in December for broadcast later in the month on CBS.

Trump spurned the performing arts center in his first term after some honorees refused to attend a traditional White House event recognizing their achievements to protest Trump's policies, including those toward the arts. He did not attend the taping of the awards program during those four years in office.

There is nothing on the president's public schedule today. However, press secretary Karoline Leavitt will hold a briefing at 1 p.m. ET.

Trump took command of the police department and deployed the National Guard under laws and Constitutional powers that give the federal government more sway over the nation's capital than other cities. The measure still leaves significant power to the president and Congress, though no president has exercised the police powers before. 

Here's a look at what the law says about Trump's actions:

1. Trump activated the National Guard. The president can still call up the National Guard in Washington. His authority is less clear in Los Angeles, where a legal battle continues over his recent deployment of the National Guard despite the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom.

2. Trump took over the local police. Section 740 of the Home Rule Act allows for the president to take over Washington's Metropolitan Police Department for 48 hours, with possible extensions to 30 days, during times of emergencies. No president has done so before. 

3. Trump didn't specify how long the takeover would last. Congress still has power over things like the budget and laws passed by the city council, but would have to repeal the Home Rule Act to expand federal power in the district.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday that President Trump's announcement of his takeover of D.C. police force were “unsettling” but not without precedent.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Some of the 800 National Guard members deployed by President Donald Trump began arriving in the nation's capital on Tuesday, ramping up after the White House ordered federal forces to take over the city's police department and reduce crime in what the president called — without substantiation — a lawless city.

The influx came the morning after Trump announced he would be activating the guard members and taking over the department. He cited a crime emergency — but referred to the same crime that city officials stress is already falling noticeably. The president holds the legal right to make such moves for at least a month.

Mayor Muriel Bowser pledged to work alongside the federal officials Trump has tasked with overseeing the city's law enforcement, while insisting the police chief remained in charge of the department and its officers. 

“How we got here or what we think about the circumstances — right now we have more police, and we want to make sure we use them,” she told reporters. 

The tone was a shift the day before, when Bowser said Trump's plan to take over the Metropolitan Police Department and call in the National Guard was not a productive step and argued his perceived state of emergency simply doesn't match the declining crime numbers. Still, the law gives the federal government more sway over the capital city than in U.S. states, and Bowser said her administration's ability to push back is limited. 




Attorney General Pam Bondi, meanwhile, called the Tuesday morning meeting productive in a social media post and said the Justice Department would “work closely with the D.C. city government” to “make Washington, D.C., safe again.” 

While Trump invokes his plan by saying that “we're going to take our capital back,” Bowser and the MPD maintain that violent crime overall in Washington has decreased to a 30-year low after a sharp rise in 2023. Carjackings, for example, dropped about 50% in 2024 and are down again this year. More than half of those arrested, however, are juveniles, and the extent of those punishments is a point of contention for the Trump administration.

Bowser, a Democrat, spent much of Trump's first term in office openly sparring with the Republican president. She fended off his initial plans for a military parade through the streets and stood in public opposition when he called in a multi-agency flood of federal law enforcement to confront anti-police brutality protesters in summer 2020. She later had the words “Black Lives Matter” painted in giant yellow letters on the street about a block from the White House.

In Trump's second term, backed by Republican control of both houses of Congress, Bowser has walked a public tightrope for months, emphasizing common ground with the Trump administration on issues such as the successful effort to bring the NFL's Washington Commanders back to the District of Columbia. 

She watched with open concern for the city streets as Trump finally got his military parade this summer. Her decision to dismantle Black Lives Matter Plaza earlier this year served as a neat metaphor for just how much the power dynamics between the two executives had evolved. 

Now that fraught relationship enters uncharted territory as Trump has followed through on months of what many D.C. officials had quietly hoped were empty threats. The new standoff has cast Bowser in a sympathetic light, even among her longtime critics. 

“It's a power play and we're an easy target,” said Clinique Chapman, CEO of the D.C. Justice Lab. A frequent critic of Bowser, whom she accuses of “over policing our youth” with the recent expansions of Washington's youth curfew, Chapman said Trump's latest move “is not about creating a safer D.C. It's just about power.”

Bowser contends that all the power resides with Trump and that her administration can do little other than comply and make the best of it. As long as Washington remains a federal enclave with limited autonomy under the 1973 Home Rule Act, she said, it will remain vulnerable to such takeovers.

“We know that access to our democracy is tenuous,” Bowser said. “That is why you have heard me, and many many Washingtonians before me, advocate for full statehood for the District of Columbia.” 

Section 740 of the Home Rule Act allows the president to take over Washington's police for up to 30 days during times of emergencies. No president has done so before, said Monica Hopkins, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union's D.C. chapter. 

“That should alarm everyone,” she said, “not just in Washington.”

For Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects an escalation of his aggressive approach to law enforcement. The District of Columbia's status as a congressionally established federal district gives him a unique opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime.

“Let me be crystal clear,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said during Trump's announcement news conference. “Crime in D.C. is ending and ending today.”

Trump's declaration of a state of emergency fits the general pattern of his second term in office. He has declared states of emergency on issues ranging from border protection to economic tariffs, enabling him to essentially rule via executive order. In many cases, he has moved forward while the courts sorted them out.

Bowser's claims about successfully driving down violent crime rates received backing earlier this year from an unlikely source. Ed Martin, Trump's original choice for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, issued a press release in April hailing a 25% drop in violent crime rates from the previous year. 

“Thanks to the leadership of President Trump and the efforts of our ‘Make D.C. Safe Again' initiative, the District has seen a significant decline in violent crime,” Martin said. “We are proving that strong enforcement, and smart policies can make our communities safer.”

In May, Trump abandoned his efforts to get Martin confirmed for the post in the face of opposition in Congress. His replacement candidate, former judge and former Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, was recently confirmed. On Monday, Pirro — standing next to Trump — called his takeover “the step that we need right now to make criminals understand that they are not going to get away with it anymore.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. inflation was unchanged in July as rising prices for some imported goods were balanced by falling gas and grocery prices, leaving overall prices modestly higher than a year ago.

Consumer prices rose 2.7% in July from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, the same as the previous month and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 3.1%, up from 2.9% in June. Both figures are above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. 

The new numbers suggest that slowing rent increases and cheaper gas are offsetting some impacts of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. Many businesses are also likely still absorbing much of the cost of the duties. Tuesday's figures probably reflect some impact from the 10% universal tariff Trump imposed in April, as well as higher duties on countries such as China and Canada. 

Brian Bethune, an economist at Boston College, said that overall U.S. tariffs — calculated as the amount of duties paid by U.S. companies divided by overall imports — has reached 10%, the highest in decades, and will likely keep rising for months.

“Those cost increases will be passed on to the consumer in some way, shape, or form,” Bethune said. Some companies could return to “shrinkflation,” he added, in which they reduce the package size of a good while keeping the price the same.

And companies that are absorbing tariff costs, which would cut into their profit margins, are less likely to hire new employees, he said. 




The Federal Reserve may now be in a difficult spot. 

Hiring slowed sharply in the spring, after Trump announced tariffs in April. The stalling out of job gains has boosted financial market expectations for an interest rate cut by the central bank at its next meeting in September, and some Fed officials have raised concerns about the health of the job market. A rate cut by the Fed often, but not always, lowers borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and business loans.

Economists are divided over how Fed officials will read the data in the coming months. Some argued that the worsening jobs picture will outweigh lingering inflation concerns and lead the Fed to cut at its next meeting in September. Yet some say that with core inflation notably above 2% and rising, the Fed will postpone that decision. 

Chair Jerome Powell has warned that worsening inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines — a stance that has enraged Trump, who has defied traditional norms of central bank independence and demanded lower borrowing costs. 

On Tuesday, Trump attacked Powell again for not cutting rates and suggested he would allow a lawsuit against the Fed to proceed because of the rising costs of its extensive building renovation. It wasn't clear what lawsuit he was referring to.

On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2% in July, down from 0.3% the previous month, while core prices ticked up 0.3%, a bit faster than the 0.2% in June.

Gas prices fell 2.2% from June to July and have plunged 9.5% from a year earlier, the government's report said. Grocery prices slipped 0.1% last month, though they are still 2.2% higher than a year ago. 

Tariffs appeared to raise the cost of some imported items: Shoe prices jumped 1.4% from June to July, though they are still just 0.9% more expensive than a year ago. The cost of furniture leapt 0.9% in July and is 3.2% higher than a year earlier.

Coffee costs nearly 15% more than a year earlier, mostly because of troubled harvests overseas, though steep duties on imports from Brazil could push those prices higher in the coming months. Nearly all U.S. coffee is imported. 

Tuesday's data arrives at a highly-charged moment for the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects and publishes the inflation data. Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, then the head of BLS, after the Aug. 1 jobs report also showed sharply lower hiring for May and June than had previously been reported. 

The president posted on social media Monday that he has picked E.J. Antoni, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and a frequent critic of the jobs report, to replace McEntarfer. 

Adding to the turmoil at BLS is a government hiring freeze that has forced it to cut back on the data it collects for each inflation report, the agency has said. UBS economist Alan Detmeister estimates that BLS is now collecting about 18% fewer price quotes for the inflation report than it did earlier this year. He thinks the report will produce more volatile results, though averaged out over time, still reliable.

Smaller companies are trying to avoid raising prices and some have turned to novel ways of raising funds. 

Clothing maker Princess Awesome, which designs matching clothes for children and adults, has seen its costs jump 15% to 20% because of the tariffs. The company has joined a lawsuit seeking to block the duties. Rebecca Melsky, CEO and co-founder of the firm, says it is prohibitively expensive to make the cotton blend fabrics it uses in the United States. 

For now, the company has instituted a “tip jar” on its website where it asks customers to help defray the cost of goods. 

“We have not across the board raised prices because of the tariffs -- yet,” she said. 

Trump has insisted that overseas manufacturers will pay the tariffs by reducing their prices to offset the duties. Yet the pre-tariff prices of imports haven't fallen much since the levies were put in place. 

Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that foreign manufacturers have absorbed just 14% of the duties through June, while 22% has been paid by consumers and 64% by U.S. companies. Yet the economists expect that by this fall consumers will bear two-thirds of the burden, while foreign exporters pay a quarter and U.S. companies handle less than a tenth. 

Many large corporations are raising prices, including apparel makers Ralph Lauren and Under Armour, and eyewear company Warby Parker. Most of those increases weren't in place for Tuesday's inflation report.

Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said late last month that it would lift prices in August on about a quarter of its products by mid-single-digit percentages. Walmart has also raised prices. 

And cosmetics maker e.l.f. Beauty, which makes a majority of its products in China, said on Wednesday that it had raised prices by a dollar on its entire product assortment as of Aug. 1 because of tariff costs, the third price hike in its 21-year history.

A CNN panel suggested Monday that the ""look at the statistics"" response from some national Democrats on President Trump's crime plan might come across as ""tone-deaf.""

A CNN panel suggested on Monday that the Democratic Party's overall response to President Donald Trump's plan to reduce crime in Washington, D.C., might come across as tone-deaf, likening it to the Democratic Party's messaging on the economy during the Biden administration.

""What's striking is that national Democrats are not following Mayor Bowser‘s lead on this, and that national Democrats have been insisting, ‘Just look at the statistics, we have a 30-year low in violent crime.' Whereas Mayor Bowser is talking about, ‘Hey, we need to get 500 more police officers on the streets. We'd like the federal government to help us rebuild our jail,'"" Axios reporter Alex Thompson said during a discussion on ""The Arena with Kasie Hunt.""

""She's also talking about some of the reforms she did to make it so accused violent offenders don‘t get out of jail pretrial. So there is this disconnect, and I've talked to Democrat strategists today that think that national Democrats saying, ‘look at the statistics,' is sort of a tone-deaf way to react,"" Thompson continued. 

Trump spoke to reporters on Monday about his plan, which was immediately dismissed by top Democrats, who argued that crime is at a 30-year low.

Kristen Soltis Anderson, a CNN political commentator, pointed out that the Democratic Party's reliance on crime statistics mirrored its unsuccessful economic messaging during Joe Biden's presidency.

""Isn't this the exact same problem that Democrats had last year? Look at the statistics. We promise you the economy is great, while people are going, ‘It doesn't feel great to me.' That feels like a lot of this conversation around crime that you can point to statistics all day long that say, ‘Hey, D.C. is safer this year than it was last year,' but do people feel safe?"" she observed.

""Bottom line, if they don't, they may be more okay with something that would otherwise be considered extraordinary,"" Anderson said.

Former Republican lawmaker Peter Meijer chimed in, saying Mayor Muriel Bowser might know something about the possible manipulation of statistics at the D.C. police department. 

""She may know some things that national Democrats are not paying attention to,"" Meijer said.

""It is also true, crime is one of these things where the randomness of it actually has a big psychological effect, right?"" said Jamal Simmons, a former communications director for Kamala Harris.  ""When random crime happens along 14th street or one of the big thoroughfares here in the district, people get very animated about it.""

CNN host Kasie Hunt also pointed out that a D.C. murder victim Trump referenced during the press conference on Monday, former Trump administration official Mike Gill, who was killed during a carjacking in 2024, was one of her neighbors.

Fox News chief correspondent Jonathan Hunt discusses California Gov. Gavin Newsom's response to Texas' redistricting plan on ‘Fox News Live.'

Former NBC host Chuck Todd argued that America is heading towards a ""cold civil war"" on ""The Chuck Toddcast"" on Tuesday as redistricting battles in states like Texas and California continue to rage.

Todd contended that the ongoing redistricting battles are ""just the latest skirmish between what is turning into a cold civil war,"" and that it is President Donald Trump and the Republican Party who are ""creating this unprecedented challenge to our constitutional republic."" 

""I hate using that rhetoric. I hate using those words, but what else are you going to describe it? We are literally having a redistricting war between the states right now, and we have governors who have decided they don't care about the minority rights in their own states,"" Todd argued. 

""Greg Abbott doesn't care. If you don't agree with Greg Abbott, he is going to force his will upon you in the state of Texas. And if you don't agree with Gavin Newsom and how they're going — he's going to force his will upon you,"" he added.

FORMER DEMOCRATIC ADVISOR SAYS PARTY'S RHETORIC ON REDISTRICTING IS GETTING 'A LITTLE OUT OF CONTROL'

Chuck Todd criticized both Democrats and Republicans for their roles in helping foment what he called a ""cold civil war,"" but focused in on Trump and the Republican Party as the primary catalysts to the situation. (Screenshot/""The Chuck Toddcast""/YouTube )

The former NBC host stated that ""this is not what the founders intended,"" placing blame on both sides of the aisle, but focusing in on Trump as the primary catalyst for what he describes as a ""cold civil war.""

""This is not a policy fight. This isn't the usual partisan back and forth. It is a direct stress test of whether our constitutional system actually works when a president and his party decide they don't have to care about the limits that are written down on paper,"" he asserted. ""Trump has spent years — parts of his first term and much so far of these first 200-plus days bending and breaking the guard rails of the republic.""

While Todd criticized the Trump administration's use of federal power and Texas Governor Greg Abbott's redistricting efforts, he also took issue with the Democrats' 'fight fire with fire' approach to these perceived problems.

 ""The Democratic response is pretty troubling because, right now as a party, okay, as an official party apparatus, they've decided to frame this moment as a war, right? Okay, you got to fight fire with fire. This is an unprecedented moment, so they're framing this as a war,"" he stated. ""And when you tell yourself you're in a war, you start rationalizing things you'd normally not do that you would say is immoral or wrong or unprincipled. But hey, it's war and all is fair in war, right?""

Todd noted that Democrats have championed independent commissions and wanted competitive district mapping for years, but now with Republicans ""openly wanting to break the rules like they're doing in Texas,"" Democrats are also looking to ""break the rules"" with their own redistricting efforts.

""And if you criticize that decision, as I've been doing, I've been told I'm naive, that I don't understand the stakes, that you are not taking this threat seriously,"" he railed. ""Au contraire, my friend, I do God – understand the stakes, and we are not replacing one unprincipled, unconstitutional set of leaders with another set of unprincipled, unconstitutional set of leaders.""

In closing, Todd called on Republican members of Congress to ""check"" Trump's power and use the tools afforded to them by the Constitution to hold him accountable for the ""unconstitutional"" actions he has taken while in office.

""They've not lifted one finger of oversight. Not one… You couldn't even say there've been a weak check on Trump. It has been no check on him at all,"" he asserted. ""Guess what? The Constitution can't enforce itself without people willing to wield those checks. All we have are words on yellowing parchment paper.""

A man was shot and killed in Washington, D.C. on Monday, just hours after President Donald Trump announced a federal takeover of the city's police department. 

The victim was found in the 1200 block of 12th Street NW in Washington, D.C.'s Logan Circle neighborhood around 7 p.m., a Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital. 

""Upon arrival, officers located an adult male, unconscious and not breathing, suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. DC Fire and EMS responded and transported the victim to a local hospital, where despite all lifesaving efforts the victim was pronounced dead,"" the spokesperson added. ""Homicide Detectives are investigating.""

On Monday, Trump said he would federalize the police department and place it under the authority of U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in an effort to address crime. He also said he was activating approximately 800 National Guard troops to ""reestablish law, order and public safety"" in the capital.

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called the move ""unsettling and unprecedented."" 

""While this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can't say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we're totally surprised,"" Bowser said during a news conference. ""I can say to D.C. residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes you proud.""

The District of Columbia Home Rule Act allows Trump to place the city's police department under federal control for up to 30 days. 

The Washington, D.C. City Council called the temporary takeover a ""manufactured intrusion on local authority."" 

""Violent crime in the District is at the lowest rates we've seen in 30 years. Federalizing the Metropolitan Police Department is unwarranted because there is no Federal emergency,"" the council said in a joint statement. ""Further, the National Guard has no public safety training or knowledge of local laws. The Guard's role does not include investigating or solving crimes in the District. Calling out the National Guard is an unnecessary deployment with no real mission.""

Former NBA star Sebastian Telfair expressed hope that President Donald Trump would pardon him as he's set to report to prison on Tuesday for violating the terms of his release.

Telfair was among the former NBA players caught up in a healthcare fraud scandal. He was given a suspended sentence for his role in the fraud.

However, Sportico reported in June that Telfair failed to live up to the terms of his conditional supervised release. He didn't live up to his court-ordered community service and didn't report to the U.S. Probation Office and is now set to spend six months in prison over it.

He told TMZ Sports this week that the situation was ""definitely some bulls---.""

""Trump, go check in on my story, and you're definitely going to want to pardon me. You'll hold me accountable and want me to continue to go do good. But I did too good to being sending anybody to jail,"" he told TMZ Sports.

Telfair claimed the whole issue stemmed from a problem with paperwork and that it was ""super unfair.""

He said if Trump doesn't come through for him then he will be in jail trying to improve himself.

Telfair was among 18 former NBA players who were charged in October 2021 with pocketing about $2.5 million by defrauding the NBA's health and welfare benefit plan with a scam that involved fake medical and dental expenses.

NBA champion Glen ""Big Baby"" Davis was given a 40-month sentence in May 2024.

Telfair reached a plea deal in the case, with prosecutors recommending that he serve between 15 and 21 months, according to Sportico. He was sentenced to time served and three years of a supervised release program.

Fox News contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss a breakthrough blood test to diagnose Alzheimer's and the rise in whooping cough cases seen in Hawaii. 

Many assume that memory loss and cognitive decline are an inevitable part of aging — but new research suggests that doesn't have to be the case.

A 25-year study from Northwestern University analyzed the brains of ""super agers"" to determine what traits they share that may contribute to their mental resilience.

""Super agers"" are defined as people 80 and older who show ""outstanding memory performance"" that is on par with those who are three decades younger, according to the researchers.

'MISSING LINK' TO ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE FOUND IN STUDY OF HUMAN BRAIN TISSUE

""‘Super ager' is not a condition, but rather a term we defined at Northwestern on the basis of a score on a memory test over age 80,"" lead author Sandra Weintraub, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and neurology at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told Fox News Digital.

""We were interested in memory aging because memory decline is the most common complaint in older adults. One can be ‘super' in many ways, and this is just one.""

""Super agers"" are defined as people 80 and older who show ""outstanding memory performance"" that is on par with those who are three decades younger. (iStock)

In the study, the researchers analyzed 79 brains that were donated by super agers and identified some key differences compared to those who ""age typically.""

Some of the brains contained amyloid and tau proteins, which typically accumulate in people with Alzheimer's disease, while other brains showed no sign of these toxins.

ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCHERS SAY TARGETING BRAIN SUGAR COULD HELP PROTECT AGAINST DEMENTIA

""Some super agers have very few of these proteins, so for some reason they don't manufacture them,"" Weintraub noted. ""But we found some super agers' brains contained large numbers of these proteins, despite maintaining their cognitive health until death.""

This means there may be different biological pathways to super aging — ""one resistance and the other resilience,"" she said.

""If your relative is forgetful at age 80, it may not be part of aging, but of disease.""

With the resistance group, they don't make the plaques and tangles, Weintraub said. In the resilience group, they make them, but they don't have any impact on their brains.

While ""typically aging"" brains show thinning of the cortex — which is the outer layer of the brain that helps with decision-making, motivation and regulation of emotions — the super agers' brains did not show this characteristic.

TWO CANCER DRUGS SHOW PROMISE IN REVERSING ALZHEIMER'S DEVASTATING EFFECTS

Super agers were also found to have a greater number of ""von economo neurons,"" which are brain cells that control social behavior. The researchers also found that this group had larger ""entorhinal neurons,"" which are essential for powering memory, the release stated.

In terms of behavior, the super agers were also found to be ""highly social"" with strong interpersonal relationships, according to the study findings.

""There is the common assumption that aging implicitly brings cognitive decline and that loss of short-term memory is part of ‘normal aging,'"" lead author Sandra Weintraub, professor of psychiatry and neurology at Northwestern Medicine, told Fox News Digital.

ALZHEIMER'S RISK COULD RISE WITH SPECIFIC SLEEP PATTERN, EXPERTS WARN

""The truth is that on average, cognitive test scores decline, but the variance among individuals within that average span gets larger and larger with age,"" she continued.

""That means that loss is not inevitable, and that if your relative is forgetful at age 80, it may not be part of aging, but of disease.""

Christopher Weber, Ph.D., senior director of global science initiatives at the Alzheimer's Association in Chicago, was not involved in the study but commented on the ""exciting"" findings.

""This increases our understanding of people's brains as they age and gives some insight into what makes some resilient or resistant to age-related brain changes,"" Weber told Fox News Digital.

The study shows that super agers have ""more preserved brain structure"" that is similar to much younger adults, according to Weber. 

""The findings suggest that cognitive decline is not an inevitable part of aging — especially for individuals who have more protective factors that preserve brain health and cognition,"" he said.

Researcher Dr. Tamar Gefen examines a slide of a super ager brain. (Shane Collins, Northwestern University)

Weber pointed out, however, that the ""super aging"" study population is small and not representative of the real-world population.

""They are primarily well-educated and White,"" he said. ""Also, this group was self-selected into the study. These individuals may be more health-conscious or cognitively engaged than average older adults.""

Even so, the findings could help scientists create more — and better — strategies for treating and preventing cognitive decline, according to Weber.

""The more we know about successful aging, the more opportunities we have to discover and create interventions to enhance resistance and resilience.""

To help reduce the risk factors that affect brain health, Weintraub said, ""What is good for your heart is good for your brain.""

""What is good for your heart is good for your brain.""

""We know that adopting certain lifestyle changes will reduce the risk of a bad outcome, but are not guaranteed to eradicate it,"" she told Fox News Digital.  

""Having said that, eat well, sleep well, exercise, socialize and value social relationships, treat whatever condition you have that you can treat, and stay away from harmful substances.""

The study was supported by the Northwestern Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health.

The findings were published in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Trump nominates EJ Antoni for BLS chief after firing predecessor over jobs report","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3496912/trump-nominates-ej-antoni-bls-chief/","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 00:02:30 GMT","

President Donald Trump nominated Heritage Foundation economist E.J. Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

His nomination comes shortly after Trump fired former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, a Biden appointee who published an unfavorable job report. He included an implicit slight against McEntarfer in his announcement on Truth Social.

“I am pleased to announce that I am nominating Highly Respected Economist, Dr. E.J. Antoni, as the next Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our Economy is booming, and E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE,” the president said. “I know E.J. Antoni will do an incredible job in this new role. Congratulations E.J.!”

The BLS's July jobs report revealed that some 258,000 fewer jobs were added in May and June than previously reported, meaning the three-month moving average of job gains was just 35,000 in July, below the level needed to keep pace with population growth. Trump claimed the numbers were “rigged” and accused McEntarfer of inflating the job numbers of former President Joe Biden before the November election.

Trump's move drew widespread criticism, but Antoni was a vocal defender. Speaking with the Washington Examiner on Aug. 5, he said he was only surprised that such a move had taken so long.“Just the timing is very unfortunate because it makes it look like you're just firing the person because you weren't happy with the numbers as opposed to firing for incompetence, which I think has been the case for a couple of years now,” Antoni said.

Though he disagreed with Trump's allegation of “shenanigans,” Antoni said he did believe previous job reports were faulty due to “general incompetence.” Antoni pointed to the low survey response as illustrating McEntarfer's poor performance in the role.

FACT CHECK: TRUMP'S CLAIM THAT PRE-ELECTION JOBS REVISIONS HELPED DEMOCRATS

He provided some hints about how he'll run the BLS if he passes confirmation, but he said he didn't like how the agency still carries out phone surveys.

The debate over aging members of Congress is flaring as Democrats confront a series of health crises, retirements, and looming primary challenges that could reshape the party's leadership ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) underwent surgery Monday at Griffin Hospital in her home state of Connecticut to treat spinal stenosis, a disease that is often caused by an increase in age.

DeLauro, 82, said Monday her spinal stenosis surgery “was a success” and that she plans to return to Washington when Congress reconvenes in September. Her surgery comes after three older House Democrats have died this year, giving House Republicans more room for error despite their slim majority.

Democratic strategist Jon Reinish argued that the party is facing a “generational crisis” in leadership, with an aging caucus and outdated messaging undermining its ability to connect with younger voters.

According to LabNews, at the start of the 119th Congress, the average age of House Democrats was 59 years old, with Republicans slightly lower at 57 years old.

While historically seen as the “party of the future,” Democrats now lag Republicans in cultivating younger lawmakers. Reinish said the House, in particular, has resisted passing the torch, even after high-profile deaths in office created avoidable political consequences. 

“We've had several members die in office, unbelievably, including the fact that had these members not died in office, and had actually handed their seats over to the next generation of leaders, Republicans would not have been able to pass their ‘big, beautiful bill,'” Reinish said.

Reinish likened the situation of Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) to that of the late California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who died in office in 2023 after a long period of visible health struggles. He questioned whether leaders of such advanced age can remain the strong, visible advocates their constituents need in moments of crisis.

Norton, 88, has faced quiet but persistent concerns from District of Columbia Council members and congressional colleagues about whether she should seek another term. In June, she twice told reporters that she planned to run for reelection, only for her spokeswoman, Sharon Nichols, to walk back the remarks shortly afterward. The Washington Examiner sought an update from her office but received no response.

While the district's longtime delegate issued several statements on Monday, she was notably absent from any press events with Mayor Muriel Bowser. This was just hours after President Donald Trump announced he would place the Metropolitan Police Department “under direct federal control” and deploy National Guard troops to the capital.

“Washington's voice in Congress has been revealed to be a Dianne Feinstein–type situation in which her age and human frailties are so advanced,” Reinish said. “Does one expect her to be the forceful voice that Washington, D.C., and its hundreds of thousands of taxpaying, yet underrepresented constituents need right now? I don't think so.”

Several senior Senate Democrats have recently announced they will not seek reelection in 2026, signaling a modest generational shift in the chamber. Sens. Gary Peters (D-MI), Tina Smith (D-MN), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Dick Durbin (D-IL) have all said they will retire at the end of their terms, opening seats in both competitive and safe Democratic states. Reinish credited these moves as a sign the Senate is “starting to get the message,” while warning that the House's entrenched seniority system still encourages members to stay “too long at the fair.” 

A senior aide to a Democratic senator said recent events have underscored the value of energetic, highly visible lawmakers who can connect directly with voters outside Washington.

“This extended district work period has already exemplified why younger members of Congress are so important,” the person said on the condition of anonymity to reflect candidly on the situation. “They are holding town halls, meeting with constituents, and getting our message out there. We desperately need that energy in a moment like this.”

The aide's comments come as questions of age and generational change loom over several looming contests. Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-TX), 78, may now face 36-year-old House Progressive Caucus Chairman Greg Casar (D-TX) as Republicans in the Lone Star State attempt to redraw the congressional map. Their districts could be merged, making for a possible heated primary between two incumbents, where age could be large factor. Doggett's office did not respond to the Washington Examiner for comment.

“So in the case of congresswoman DeLauro, of course, she has long, long, long represented her district for decades,” Reinish said. “And you know, same with her and with congressman Doggett. You know with that seniority comes policy and legislative expertise, and that is so much a part of the value proposition of that House career, where you really know policies so well and can make change in these very fine details that one would only know after that long and rich career.”

“But you have to balance it with, so carefully, especially these days, after all of these instances and crises that are largely self-inflicted, that I have referred to you, have to balance that with knowing not to stay too long at the fair and knowing when it's time,” he continued.

Primaries are common for both political parties as an election cycle approaches and can indicate a sea change in politics. A wave of establishment Republicans was ousted in the 2010s during the tea party movement as voters were frustrated by Washington not doing enough on fiscal troubles or reducing the federal government's reach.

As health problems have affected Democrats in Congress, a large push has begun to primary older members.

Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA), 70, is facing a primary from his former congressional staffer, Jake Rakov. Saikat Chakrabarti, 39, the former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), is primarying former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), 85. Influencer and former liberal watchdog group staffer Kat Abughazaleh, 26, announced her candidacy against Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), 81. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD), 86, the longest-serving House Democrat, has also garnered a primary challenger from a 35-year-old making age a key issue.

ROSE DELAURO HOSPITALIZED, WILL UNDERGO SURGERY FOR SPINAL STENOSIS

While DeLauro plans to seek another term, she has been met with a primary challenge from Damjan DeNoble, who has targeted her age as a concern, saying, “Our old Democratic leaders won't pass the torch.”

Rakov  echoed the sentiment, telling the Washington Examiner, “In my case, do you not see that there is another generation of people ready to step in and lead, and be able to actually maintain, and like fight at a stronger voice, and in a smarter way, in a more modern way?”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump is painting Democrats as soft on crime ahead of the 2026 midterm elections as he seizes control of law enforcement in Washington and accuses liberals of presiding over a public safety crisis.

Trump announced Monday morning that he, for the first time in the nation's history, will federalize the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia and mobilize hundreds of National Guard troops to supplement a crackdown on violent crime in the district.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES FEDERAL TAKEOVER OF DC POLICE TO FIGHT CRIME: WHAT TO KNOW

The move was followed by Trump's threats to expand his law enforcement push to other cities led by Democrats, including Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Baltimore, and Oakland, California.

“We're not going to lose our cities over this,” Trump said of crime. “And this will go further.”

While Washington is unique because Congress controls it and the president can order up the National Guard, Trump's calling out other blue cities put Democrats on defense, claiming that crime is not bad enough to warrant such federal interference.

“Violent crime in Washington, D.C. is at a thirty-year low,” Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) said. “Donald Trump has no basis to take over the local police department. And zero credibility on the issue of law and order. Get lost.”

The takeover of the MPD, which is expected to last 30 days, was met with outrage from leading Democratic lawmakers, including Govs. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), JB Pritzker (D-IL), and Wes Moore (D-MD), all possible 2028 presidential candidates.

“He was just getting warmed up in Los Angeles,” Newsom wrote on social media following Trump's Monday press conference, referencing the president's use of National Guard assets earlier this year to quell protests and riots surrounding Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in the Los Angeles area. “He will gaslight his way into militarizing any city he wants in America. This is what dictators do.”

“Let's not lie to the public, you and I both know you have no authority to take over Chicago,” Pritzker added in his statement. “By the way, where are the Epstein files?”

Moore said, “Trump's decision to mobilize the National Guard to conduct municipal policing in D.C. lacks seriousness and is deeply dangerous.”

The Democratic Mayors Association cited statistics showing that “crime is down in most major cities — including Washington, D.C.” to claim that Trump “only wants to create another political charade to serve his own interests and distract Americans from his failures.”

Senior Republican operatives with close ties to the Trump White House told the Washington Examiner that Newsom, Pritzker, and other presidential hopefuls “predictably” fell into Trump's political trap, one that pits them on the “losing side” of the issue.

“There's no denying that Washington is an absolute cesspool — wannabe teenage gangsters, weed smoke everywhere,” one former Trump administration official said. “President Trump is doing what any reasonable person would hope, making this city safe and livable. And instead of saying, ‘Thank you, Mr. President, for cleaning up our streets,' the Democrats are coming out as pro-crime. It's the perfect play.”

“I certainly hope so,” a veteran operative with past work on Trump's political campaigns laughed when asked if Trump's move could put Democrats at a disadvantage ahead of next year's elections. 

Trump has employed similar tactics in the past, albeit with mixed results. Throughout the 2020 campaign, which he lost, the president repeatedly sought to paint Democratic nominee Joe Biden and others in his party as soft on crime by linking them to the Black Lives Matter protests and national police reform movements.

That tactic proved much more successful during the 2024 election. However, as Trump was able to spin Biden and then-Vice President Kamala Harris's border policies into electoral gold, he specifically sought to tie immigration to crime on Monday morning.

“We're not going to take it just like we did on our southern border,” he said during his press conference. “Nobody comes to our southern border anymore.”

Trump's intervention happened after a string of high-profile crimes in Washington, including the murder of two Israeli Embassy staffers, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim; the attack of Edward Coristine, a former Department of Government Efficiency engineer who goes by the nickname “Big Balls;” and the shooting death of 21-year-old congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym.

Tamara Tarpinian-Jachym, Eric's mother, said she does not care that statistics show crime may be declining when far too many people are getting hurt.

“I looked at Eric's ashes, and I said, ‘Eric, you haven't died in vain,'” Tarpinian-Jachym told Fox News in praising Trump's announcement. “Things will change so other people are safe when they go visit D.C. or work at D.C. And that's my goal, to make people safe.”

Even the DC Police Union issued a statement on Monday welcoming Trump's takeover announcement. Chairman Gregg Pemberton said his union stands “with the president in recognizing that Washington, DC, cannot continue on this trajectory.”

“Crime is out of control, and our officers are stretched beyond their limits,” Pemberton wrote. “The federal intervention is a critical stopgap, but the MPD needs proper staffing and support to thrive. This can only happen by repealing the disastrous policies that have driven out our best officers and hindered recruitment.”

“This is why Democrats continue to be so unpopular among everyday Americans — they think the President of the United States cracking down on crime in our nation's capital is a bad thing,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers added in a statement when asked if Trump's announcement is meant to put political pressure on the opposing party.

However, Trump's polling remains negative, with the RealClearPolitics average showing his approval rating sitting 6 points underwater as of Monday. Furthermore, only 4% of respondents to an Economist-YouGov tracking poll last week ranked crime as the most important issue to them, with inflation and prices (21%), jobs and the economy (14%), and healthcare (11%) all significantly outranking crime.

And not all Democrats took Trump's Monday bait.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser framed Trump's announcement as an opportunity to supplement their existing police initiatives.

“I can't say that, given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we're totally surprised,” she told reporters. “I can say to D.C. residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes you proud.”

Though Bowser did call Trump's moves “unprecedented,” she also repeatedly declined to tell reporters that she would resist the federal takeover in any form or fashion, despite protests breaking out in the city demanding a “Free D.C.“

“If people are concerned about the president being able to move the National Guard into our city, the time to do that would have been when Congress had a bill that it could have given control of the D.C. National Guard to D.C.,” the mayor continued.

A Democratic National Committee spokesman declined to comment on whether Trump's district takeover would put political pressure on Democrats regarding crime, instead citing Chairman Ken Martin's statement from earlier in the day.

“Donald Trump's record as president is marked by gross abuses of power, and his latest move to supersede local law enforcement by deploying the National Guard to Washington, D.C. is no exception,” Martin wrote. 

Democratic strategist Mike Nellis downplayed questions regarding whether Trump has potentially put pressure on Democrats concerning crime.

“Federalizing the D.C. police is another wild swing from the president as his approval rating continues to crater,” Nellis told the Washington Examiner. “His decision-making is driven by erratic attempts to change the subject.”

Nellis, who worked for Harris's 2020 Democratic primary campaign, during which she was pressured regarding crime, added, “Polls show him underwater on every major issue, including immigration. Most Americans don't care about what happens in DC — they want action on the economy, and most say they're worse off than before Trump took office.”

A second Democratic strategist, Christopher Hahn, agreed.

TRUMP FEDERALIZES DC POLICE AND ACTIVATES NATIONAL GUARD TO COMBAT CRIME: ‘TAKE OUR CAPITAL BACK'

“This is the standard GOP playbook being taken to another level,” Hahn said.

“Now that he's involved, he owns all of it,” Hahn told the Washington Examiner regarding Trump. “And we all know how powerful a single crime can be in political ads.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The marijuana industry is pouring millions of dollars into a lobbying campaign to push President Donald Trump into reclassifying marijuana as a harmless substance. It would be a grievous error for him to do so, worsening the opioid epidemic and weakening communities that Trump swore to protect from special interests.

The president told people who attended a recent $1 million-a-plate fundraising event that he was considering moving marijuana from Schedule I, the highest level of restriction under the Controlled Substances Act, to Schedule III, a lower classification used for things such as ketamine and codeine. The lower classification would mean easier and wider marijuana use and more financing for the already multibillion-dollar marijuana industry. One of those at the fundraiser was Kim Rivers, CEO of Truleive, one of the largest marijuana companies in the nation. 

Trump has signaled weakness on marijuana before. He said he would vote for the marijuana legalization ballot referendum in Florida last fall. Trulieve and other big marijuana firms spent millions of dollars on television ads supporting legalization and on lobbying the president personally. He is reportedly interested in the issue because it is broadly popular with voters, including many Republicans. The Florida decriminalization measure got more than 50% support and barely missed getting the 60% it needed to pass.

Although reclassifying marijuana could give Trump a small temporary boost among some libertarians and drug users, it would be a disaster for the nation in the long term.

Marijuana is not harmless, as marijuana companies and their ally George Soros try to make it seem. The Soros-funded Drug Policy Alliance has spent millions of dollars legalizing marijuana in 11 states and Washington, D.C., and the results have been consistently appalling. 

Because of marijuana commercialization, youth cannabis use has increased by 245% in the last 20 years. Marijuana is far more addictive than Soros and the marijuana companies claim, especially now that it is three times stronger than it used to be. Increased marijuana use has been linked to schizophrenia and permanent brain damage, particularly in the frontal cortex. Marijuana use and abuse have grown wherever it has been legalized. 

The National Bureau of Economic Research has found that marijuana legalization is associated with higher rates of opioid deaths. “We're becoming a drug-infested nation,” Trump said in 2017. “Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars.” He is right. Drugs are deeply damaging our nation and its people. “We will not rest until we have ended the drug addiction crisis,” Trump promised in 2023. Moving marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III would be a step backward in combating the crisis of America's drug infestation.

Trump has recently become committed to ridding Washington, D.C., of crime. So instead of making it easier to buy and smoke marijuana, Trump should make it harder. The constant, pervasive, and unpleasant smell of marijuana — it's sometimes referred to as “skunk” — plagues all of Washington, D.C. Trump has the power to end that. There is no reason the federal enclave created by the Constitution to host the nation's federal capital should smell like a drug den, and every reason it shouldn't.

MAKE THE FOOD STAMP JUNK FOOD BAN PERMANENT

“All policy and legal requirements and implications are being considered,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said when questioned about Trump's thinking on marijuana. The only interest guiding the president's policy decisions is what is in the best interest of the American people.”

We hope that is true. If it is true, the only decision Trump can properly make is to keep marijuana in its current classification.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

“Their time here is up,” she said of J-1 visa holders who worked for Voice of America.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

After rushing to shut down the government-funded media outlets she was tapped to lead, Kari Lake has launched on a mission so strange that it is perhaps unprecedented: She is trying to force her own employees out of the country.

Lake has been making the rounds on right-wing media in recent weeks to pitch herself as a devoted enforcer of President Donald Trump's broader agenda. Her latest targets are J-1 visa holders who worked for Voice of America. Obscure to most Americans, they have attracted Lake's attention in part because they embody a trifecta of triggers for Trump's ire—they are federal employees, they are immigrants, and they are journalists.

And in Lake's telling—which distorts the facts in pursuit of a more provocative narrative—they are national-security threats worthy of the same kind of rough handling that Trump has encouraged for suspected Venezuelan gang members.

“Their time here is up. And I said before, if I have to go to the airport with them, and accompany them to the airport and get them on the flight, I will do that,” Lake, a former journalist herself, told Eric Bolling of the right-wing TV channel Real America's Voice last month. Bolling responded by suggesting that the journalists could be sent to “Alligator Alcatraz,” Florida's new massive migrant-detention center in the Everglades. Lake began to laugh before saying, “If you overstay your visa, ICE is going to find you. And they will find you in this case as well.”

Eric Schlosser: ‘We voted for retribution'

The Trump administration's anti-immigrant fervor has come to Voice of America, which for years has recruited journalists from all over the world to broadcast the American point of view globally. Some of those reporters face likely persecution or imprisonment if they are deported to their home nations after having worked for the United States government.

Since landing at the U.S. Agency for Global Media—the federal parent of Voice of America—in February, Lake has moved with speed to decimate VOA and independent broadcasters that receive government funding, including Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks. Shortly after Trump's March 14 executive order to close down her agency, she placed almost all of VOA's staff on administrative leave, fired hundreds of contractors, and ended programming throughout much of the world.

For the first time since VOA was founded, in 1942, to counter Nazi propaganda during World War II, the network went dark in March. In some parts of the world, viewers wondered if the blank screens meant a coup had taken place in the U.S., Steve Herman, who recently retired from VOA after a 20-year career, told me.

In her public comments, Lake has described Voice of America—once hailed bipartisanly as a prime example of U.S. soft power—as “rotten to the core” and “a serious threat to our national security.” Its destruction has been so swift and debilitating that few of the former VOA journalists and executives I spoke with think it can ever recover the level of international influence it once had. Today, only a few dozen people work at the agency, down from more than 1,300 before Trump retook office. VOA has downsized from broadcasting in almost 50 languages to just a handful. During the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran in June, which culminated in U.S. strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, VOA had to ask dozens of staffers to return to work and restart the Persian news division's broadcasts.

The sudden downfall of VOA will have long-term and unknown impact on America's foreign policy, yet it has had more immediate consequences for dozens of J-1 visa holders who had worked as translators and broadcasters in languages including Mandarin, Indonesian, and Bangla. As a condition of their visas, they had to remain employed by the U.S. Agency for Global Media, or depart the U.S. within 30 days.

Some have already left. Others are making asylum claims. A few quickly got married or began considering enrolling in school to avoid being sent back to countries where they may not be welcome.

Their plight showcases how Trump's mass-deportation agenda has morphed beyond its original contours. Although the president campaigned on a pledge to deport “the worst of the worst”—the gang members and criminals Trump has claimed foreign governments purposefully sent to infiltrate America's southern border—Lake is targeting multilingual professionals who had been actively recruited by the U.S. to help counter propaganda from hostile nations.

“In many ways, they're exactly the people you want,” Chase Untermeyer, who served as VOA's director under President George H. W. Bush, told me. By sending them out of the country, the U.S. is giving space to governments in China, North Korea, and Iran to fill the void on the global information battlefield, he said. “It's extraordinarily short-sighted and seen in the context of so much else of what the administration has been doing to eliminate foreign aid and reduce the State Department.”

For years, VOA relied on the J-1 visa program, a cultural-exchange initiative that brings 300,000 foreigners—including au pairs and visiting medical doctors—to the U.S. annually. After spending up to three years reporting in the United States, many VOA journalists on J-1 visas have been able to pursue a green card and eventually become citizens.

That was the path Sabir Mustafa thought he was on after working for more than a year as the managing editor for VOA Bangla, the U.S. public broadcaster for Bangladesh. But on March 6, as he was working at the Washington, D.C., headquarters, he was given a letter that said the agency had determined that his role was “not a national security or mission critical position.” He was being terminated immediately, the letter said. He was asked to hand over his badge and was escorted out of the building by security. A few months short of completing his two-year probationary period, he had little recourse to try to keep his job, he told me.

Tom Nichols: They're cheering for Trump in Moscow—again

Because he was on a J-1 visa, his termination started a 30-day countdown in which he would need to settle his affairs in the U.S. and leave the country. If he overstayed his visa, he faced the prospect of being accosted by masked officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who around the same time had begun snatching foreign students off the street and flying migrants suspected of gang affiliation to an El Salvador megaprison.

“You either leave within those 30 days, or you are in violation of the law,” Mustafa told me. “And nobody wants to be in violation of the law.”

He knew that he had to leave, and unlike some of his colleagues, he's a citizen of a stable, safe country that happens to be a U.S. ally: the United Kingdom. He quickly began selling his furniture, paid to break his lease, and boarded a U.S.-funded flight back to London exactly 30 days after receiving his termination letter. Mustafa said his decision to leave was an easy one, but that was not the case for others. WhatsApp and Signal groups sprung up in which hundreds of VOA journalists offered resources and support to their J-1 colleagues, and the group hired an immigration lawyer to help.

Those with pending asylum applications have tried to keep a low profile. A representative for them declined to be interviewed for this article, hoping to avoid the political spotlight that Lake has been actively pursuing. But press-freedom organizations and former VOA directors are speaking up on behalf of these journalists, noting that several foreign reporters have been imprisoned abroad after working for U.S.-funded outlets.

“Protecting these journalists from the risk of deportation is a moral obligation and demonstrates a commitment to democratic values and a free press,” the Committee to Protect Journalists told me in a statement.

Last month, Lake shut down the J-1 visa program at VOA, attempting to cast it as a loophole through which foreign spies and other bad actors from “hostile” nations have been allowed to enter the country. Critics have long suggested that the J-1 exchange program is inappropriate for professional journalists, who instead should be using the I-1 visa program, which is specifically for foreign media. Lake has offered little evidence to back up her espionage accusations, though opponents of the agency seized on news last year that an alleged Russian spy posing as a freelance journalist had reported for VOA. The man was based in Poland and was not on a J-1 visa.

Some supporters of VOA have agreed that changes and reforms were overdue at the broadcaster—including more effective vetting of employees—but few expected that it would so quickly be declared irredeemable.

Even Lake, who lost elections for Arizona governor and the U.S. Senate in 2022 and 2024, respectively, did not initially give any indication that she would try to shut down the agency she had been tapped to oversee.

“We are fighting an information war, and there's no better weapon than the truth, and I believe VOA could be that weapon,” she said in a February 21 speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference. “Some people have suggested shutting it down. And with all the corruption, I totally get it, I do—all the corruption we're seeing. But I believe it's worth trying to save.”

Lake and the U.S. Agency for Global Media did not respond to my requests for comment.

VOA's ultimate fate is in the hands of judges who are weighing multiple lawsuits challenging Lake's authority to close the congressionally funded broadcaster. VOA's director, Michael Abramowitz, filed legal documents last week claiming Lake had illegally tried to oust him from his role. As those cases play out in court, hundreds of VOA journalists remain on paid administrative leave. Meanwhile, Lake has been appearing on other networks to portray J-1 visa holders as “spies” who are inherently dangerous because some of them come from nations that are U.S. adversaries.

“That sort of rhetoric—it's utter nonsense,” Herman, a former White House bureau chief at VOA, told me. “To perceive these people as a national-security threat is just ridiculous. In fact, it can be argued that those responsible for dismantling the Voice of America have harmed America's national security by taking away one of our most powerful instruments of public diplomacy and soft power.”

In a previous era, someone like Rio Tuasikal might be seen as evidence of the success of that kind of diplomacy.

Born in Indonesia, Tuasikal grew up watching a weekly VOA lifestyle show called Dunia Kita, an Indonesian analogue of CBS Sunday Morning that highlights American culture. The show and other VOA programming helped him see a more textured version of America than what was presented in Hollywood action films, he told me.

He said the Indonesian-born VOA journalist Patsy Widakuswara was his “role model,” and that watching her on television inspired him to come to the States on a J-1 visa and work as a journalist. (Widakuswara, who later became a U.S. citizen and the broadcaster's White House bureau chief, is a lead plaintiff in one of the lawsuits challenging Lake. The case remains pending.)

Chris Feliciano Arnold: Naturalized citizens are scared

Tuasikal had been working as a reporter for VOA's Indonesian service in February when he was handed a letter similar to the one Mustafa would later receive. It did not dawn on him until after he was escorted from the building that the termination meant he would have to leave the country in a matter of weeks. He had been in the early stages of applying for a green card.

He spoke with an immigration lawyer to see what options he might have for staying. None of the prospects seemed very promising, he told me.

“She asked me, ‘Do you have a possible good case for asylum?' And I said, ‘Well, I'm gay, and homosexuality is criminalized in Indonesia,'” he told me, referring to the country's ban on same-sex marriage.

But ultimately, with only a few days to make the decision, he opted to return to Jakarta, figuring that attempting to stay in a country that had told him he was no longer “mission critical” was not worth it.

Whereas VOA was once viewed as a diplomatic effort to cast the U.S. as a more appealing place in the eyes of foreigners, Lake's campaign against J-1 visa holders is part of a broader push that is having the opposite effect.

International tourism to the United States is down significantly this year, the number of foreign students planning to enroll at American universities this fall has dropped precipitously, and fear of arbitrary deportation has gripped longtime U.S. residents who lack legal documents.

The fact that journalists for VOA, who were invited to work for the U.S. government, have been caught up in Trump's deportation machine is likely to have a further chilling effect.

Mustafa, who told me he continues to be “shocked” by how quickly his fortunes changed after agreeing to work at VOA, said he advises anyone coming to the U.S. to think short-term and “have a backup plan.”

“I made the mistake of planning long-term,” he told me. “I bought the furniture. I shouldn't have bought the furniture.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The ultimate advice for managers could be just to be human.

The world of management is always wide open for new ideas and perspectives to make companies more efficient and profitable. Most business schools have semi-academic journals dedicated to offering up buzzy techniques that promise to streamline operations, improve accountability, and raise productivity by establishing tightly circumscribed protocols for workers. Some recommendations have merit, but others are seen both inside and outside companies as gimmicks, fads to be endured until abandoned by managers when they move on to the Next Big Thing.

Take Six Sigma, the defect-minimization strategy that was all the rage in the 1980s: Its methodology involved certifying managers with progressively more prestigious colors to encourage their advance in skill level—rather as karate or judo belts do. (Even though these were color-coded paper certificates, I like to imagine the regional vice president for sales wearing a red belt over their suit.) No doubt, some firms found the exercise useful, but as the business writer Geoffrey James notes, employees typically found Six Sigma's implementation frustrating and confusing. And according to data from 2006, among the large companies that adopted the program, 91 percent wound up trailing the S&P 500 in stock performance.

Ed Zitron: How to mentor young workers in a remote world

In place of such chimerical strategies, I want to introduce a management anti-fad. The idea will still raise business performance—by increasing happiness among the people doing the work. This idea is as old as humanity itself, you might correctly think, but if it were so obvious and simple to put into practice, then every company would be doing it. Recent research, including studies conducted both by independent academics and by firms themselves, show that understanding well-being and maximizing it through managerial practice can significantly increase productivity and profitability, as well as raise employees' quality of life. And this conclusion might just help us remember some old wisdom that modern life encourages us to forget.

The premise that workers would be more productive if they were happier makes intuitive sense, and many studies demonstrate that it is so. Some just look at variation in employee mood and then use clever statistical methods to link it to work outcomes. One example, a 2023 study on telesales workers, showed that when they felt happier, for whatever reason, it led to more calls an hour and a higher conversion of calls into sales. Another research approach involves experiments in which workers are exposed to a mood-raising experience, and their productivity afterward is compared with what it had been beforehand. During one such study in 2015, economists showed people clips of funny movies and found that doing so boosted their performance of tasks by about 12 percent.

All of that is interesting so far as it goes, but such experiments are not very practical for managers—after all, screening a lot of funny movies would significantly disrupt the office day. What leaders really need are data that break down the specific factors associated with employee happiness, translate them into management actions, measure these factors in actual companies, and link everything to the firm's performance. Only then could you devise a truly effective management strategy.

I know of one company that's trying to tie all that together: the investment-research firm Irrational Capital, founded in 2017. Using both public and private data sources on employee satisfaction, its researchers found that over an 11-year period ending in 2025, S&P 500 companies that scored in the top 20 percent on several key employee-happiness measures outperformed (in stock price) those in the bottom 20 percent by, as of the first quarter of this year, nearly six percentage points. Meanwhile, the top 20 percent in such extrinsic rewards as pay and benefits beat the bottom 20 percent by only two percentage points. These findings fluctuate according to market conditions, but across the whole period of the study, employee-happiness measures have consistently outperformed extrinsic rewards when boosting a company's stock price.

The happiness factors are not fixed characteristics of individual companies, because they move in and out of the top 20 percent depending on how satisfied employees are at any particular time. The researchers have precisely market-tested the effect of happiness factors on performance by fielding an electronically traded fund that buys and sells the companies' stock according to their current happiness ranking. Over the past five years, the fund's “trailing returns”—a performance metric that provides a historical snapshot of a given period—were about 10 percent higher than the S&P average.

Irrational Capital researchers found six specific factors behind employee satisfaction. In order of their positive impact on a firm's performance, they are: innovation (managers' openness to input and ideas); direct management (clarity and truthfulness of communication); organizational effectiveness (non-bureaucratic, efficient processes); engagement (leadership that supports learning and growth); emotional connection (a culture that fosters friendships among colleagues); and organizational alignment (a good match between the company's external mission and its internal culture). For me, as a social scientist teaching business leaders, this suggests six corresponding goals for managers who want to raise employee satisfaction that translates into higher firm performance. Here they are, ordered by importance.

1. Listen for concerns and learn new ideas.  Nothing is more disempowering for an employee than a boss who doesn't want to hear an idea that could help the company. Managers should look for ways to get as much feedback as possible, and then show they've really heard it and thought about how to use it.

2. Act and speak with clarity and truth. Particularly in times of uncertainty, employees are highly attuned to doublespeak and obfuscation. Always be frank and explicit about what they need to know for their job. People can handle I don't know what's going to happen, as long as this is the truth, not an evasion.

3. Ruthlessly cut red tape and unnecessary meetings. Employees hate bureaucracy. Some procedural stuff is necessary to maintain systems and accountability, but nothing lowers workers' well-being faster than obliging them to waste productive time. This is especially true of meetings, which should be minimized whenever possible.

4. Look for ways to support learning and develop team members. The employees you want to keep are the ones who love to learn new skills and grow in ability. Look for ways to create a culture of improvement through mentoring, training, and continuing education.

Arthur C. Brooks: Think twice before taking the top job

5. Promote a culture of friendship. This goal is easy to misunderstand: It does not entail making friends with the boss; on the contrary, as scholars found in 2004, the interlocutor who, on average, induces day to day the most negative emotion for an employee is their boss. As a boss, accept the loneliness of your role—but do whatever you can to realize the fact that the happiest employees are friends with one another.

6. Live up to the organization's external mission. Many companies have high-minded ideals on paper and are dedicated in theory to making a better world. But, as they say, charity begins at home. If your mission is to uphold the dignity of all people, your employees should be first in line.

For more than a century, virtually every corporate-productivity fad has been based on the notion that employees can be managed as if they were machines. This highly instrumental, scientistic approach to human affairs was what the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky mocked in Notes From the Underground as the “palace of crystal.” What he meant by this was the delusion of technocrats' solutions to people's problems—“all ready-made and worked out with mathematical exactitude”—that were bound to fail and leave people feeling helpless, angry, and alienated.

If Dostoyevsky were alive today, the most obvious target for his derision would no doubt be the utter domination of tech in our daily life, intermediating friendship, dating, and work relationships. Just as the great novelist predicted, the technocratic delusion promises greater connection but leaves people lonelier and more depressed every passing year. Of a piece with this palace of digital crystal are the management fads that waste money and reduce people to productivity numbers.

The way out of the palace of crystal is surprisingly simple, in life and at work: Just treat people as people.

But he has the wrong answer for how to fix it.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

President Donald Trump yesterday announced what amounts to a federal takeover of law enforcement in the District of Columbia. He declared that he would deploy the National Guard and invoke an obscure provision of the city's charter to take control of the District's Metropolitan Police Department. This was all, he said, “to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor.”

Is crime in D.C., as Trump put it last week, “totally out of control”? Critics were quick to dismiss his claims as fearmongering. They pointed to rapidly declining rates of violence over the past year. “Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false,” Mayor Muriel Bowser told MSNBC on Sunday.

The reality is more complicated than either the president or the mayor depict. Bowser is right that violence has declined. But the nation's capital really does have a long-standing and profound violence problem that will not improve without deliberate intervention.

Like most other big cities, D.C. experienced a surge in violence during the pandemic. A timely analysis from the crime researcher Jeff Asher shows that murder crested in December 2023 and has been declining steadily since; the 2025 total through last month equals the equivalent figure in 2019. Carjackings are also down; Asher reports that July saw the fewest monthly carjackings since May 2020.

Jonathan Chait: This isn't about crime

Look beyond the recent past, and the trend lines are less sunny. Although violent-crime rates overall are near 30-year lows, Washington's murder rate was generally rising even before the pandemic. The murder rate at the end of 2024 was, per Asher's data, lower than 2023, but still about 70 percent higher than that of a decade prior. And although carjackings are down, they're still elevated over pre-2020. Lastly, Asher highlights some discrepancies between the city's official violent-crime statistics and what it reports to the FBI, with the latter showing a more gradual decline in overall violence.

Notably, both sets of statistics seem out of keeping with the views of D.C. residents. About 65 percent of them told The Washington Post that crime was a “very” or “extremely” serious problem last year, even as violence declined.

Perhaps locals are responding to a measurable increase in public disorder—petty offenses such as vagrancy, shoplifting, and unsanitary conditions, which drive our perceptions of major crime. As I noted in a Manhattan Institute report last summer, indicators such as unsheltered homelessness and sanitation-enforcement requests to the city's 311 line have spiked (and those trends continue into this year). When Trump complains of rising “squalor,” he's not off base.

Such problems on their own would not necessarily warrant a federal takeover, though. What might is the fact that although crime is declining, Washington is still far more dangerous than the capital of the United States should be. Let's not define deviancy down.

D.C.'s homicide rate in 2024—roughly 26.4 homicides for every 100,000 residents—is lower than in both 2023 and its peak in the 1990s. But, according to data compiled by the Council on Criminal Justice, it's still nearly seven times higher than New York City's rate (3.8 per 100,000). D.C.'s rate is also worse than that of Philadelphia, Atlanta, and even Chicago. In fact, it's closer to that of infamously crime-ridden cities like Memphis and Detroit than it is to some other important metropoles'.

The problem looks even worse in the most violence-plagued parts of the city. As I found in my report, in 2023, 57 percent of the city's homicides took place in Wards 7 and 8, the city's poorest, with the largest percentage of Black residents. In fact, just 10 blocks in D.C. were home to 14 percent of all homicides. As in many cities, violence is also hyperconcentrated among tight social networks. According to a 2021 report from the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform, in any given year about 500 people are responsible for 60 to 70 percent of all gun violence in the city.

This violence takes a dreadful toll on the communities it affects. In 2023, the most recent year for which complete data are available, 3.4 out of every 1,000 Black boys and men ages 15 to 24 in Washington died by homicide. That's nearly 3.5 times higher than the national rate. Not all of D.C. may be like a “war-torn country.” But these rates of death are on par with those of American combatants in Afghanistan and Iraq. And the second-order effects on the rest of D.C. are similar in kind if not in scope, leading to closed businesses and flight to the suburbs.

A federal takeover of D.C.'s crime apparatus could, in theory, address this problem, though it's far from guaranteed. There's a real risk that the feds could posture for 30 days—the window in which Trump will likely maintain control of the MPD—and then declare victory as violence continues its downward trajectory. That would, of course, do little to fix the real problems.

If it wants to make a difference, instead of just look tough, the administration should focus its resources on the people and places that make the District unusually unsafe. The city has already identified the “power few” who drive the large majority of violent offending. The administration's priority should be to target these people for apprehension, prosecution, and incapacitation—as soon as possible.

The administration should also target the places where crime is most concentrated. Per an analysis from one D.C. crime researcher, the association between the level of crime in a police service area and its level of staffing is slight. The Police Executive Research Forum, in its assessment of MPD, found that less experienced officers are more likely to be assigned to the city's worst-off areas. Research shows that deploying more senior officers reduces both crime and use of force—the opposite of what D.C. does. The administration could switch things up in a way that the city perhaps could not.

Listen: The evidence on policing and crime

Trump could also target disorder by redeploying MPD officers to help with camp clearance and police the Metro. Such problems should not be the administration's first priority, especially given its brief window. But a visible police presence can help people feel safe, as well as be safe.

A focused strategy—target the people and places that drive violence—has historical precedent. In 2005, the MPD and federal government implemented a “homicide reduction strategy” that combined federal cooperation with such “focused deterrence.” A precipitous drop in D.C. homicides seems to have followed.

The success of 2005's initiative shows that the administration does not need to preempt the District in order to bring crime down. At the same time, the fact that things have been so bad for so long demonstrates the partial truth of Trump's critiques. D.C. may be getting better, but it's still quite dangerous.

The fight between Trump and the city matters much less, ultimately, than making D.C. safer. The most important thing is to recognize that the city has a real problem—and that someone needs to be responsible for fixing it.

Before smartphones and social media, teenagers constructed their identity on the walls of their room.

Listen to more stories on hark

In the 1980s and '90s, Adrienne Salinger photographed American teenagers in their natural habitat: their bedroom. Salinger was fascinated by the way these spaces reflected the personalities of their inhabitants. In an era before smartphones and social media, teenagers used the walls of their room to demonstrate their good taste in hair bands and hip-hop groups, commemorate their accomplishments, and construct their identity. These spaces, Salinger wrote in her 1995 book, In My Room, were “the repository for our memories and the expressions of our desires and self-image.”

Salinger's book, reissued this month, features portraits of dozens of teenagers. The images capture an inflection point between childhood and adolescence: Her subjects pose among stuffed animals and pinups, dolls and drug paraphernalia. In one image, a girl named Ellen stands beside a neat bookshelf, clutching a violin. On the wall behind her is a poster of James Dean astride a motorcycle—just below it, a brochure from Brown.

Most of the rooms Salinger visited—of rich and poor teens alike—were illuminated by a single light fixture at the center of the ceiling. She brought her own studio lights, which would frequently blow a fuse. As she set up her equipment, she and her subjects would talk, often for hours. Then she would take a photograph, and the teens would see their room—and themselves—in a new light.

Was your kid's report card written by a chatbot?

Rising seniors are the last class of students who remember high school before ChatGPT. But only just barely: OpenAI's chatbot was released months into their freshman year. Ever since then, writing essays hasn't required, well, writing. By the time these students graduate next spring, they will have completed almost four full years of AI high school.



Gone already are the days when using AI to write an essay meant copying and pasting its response verbatim. To evade plagiarism detectors, kids now stitch together output from multiple AI models, or ask chatbots to introduce typos to make the writing appear more human. The original ChatGPT allowed only text prompts. Now students can upload images (“Please do these physics problems for me”) and entire documents (“How should I improve my essay based on this rubric?”). Not all of it is cheating. Kids are using AI for exam prep, generating personalized study guides and practice tests, and to get feedback before submitting assignments. Still, if you are a parent of a high schooler who thinks your child isn't using a chatbot for homework assistance—be it sanctioned or illicit—think again.

Read: AI cheating is getting worse

The AI takeover of the classroom is just getting started. Plenty of educators are using AI in their own job, even if they may not love that chatbots give students new ways to cheat. On top of the time they spend on actual instruction, teachers are stuck with a lot of administrative work: They design assignments to align with curricular standards, grade worksheets against preset rubrics, and fill out paperwork to support students with extra needs. Nearly a third of K–12 teachers say they used the technology at least weekly last school year. Sally Hubbard, a sixth-grade math-and-science teacher in Sacramento, California, told me that AI saves her an average of five to 10 hours each week by helping her create assignments and supplement curricula. “If I spend all of that time creating, grading, researching,” she said, “then I don't have as much energy to show up in person and make connections with kids.”



Beyond ChatGPT and other popular chatbots, educators are turning to AI tools that have been specifically designed for them. Using MagicSchool AI, instructors can upload course material and other relevant documents to generate rubrics, worksheets, and report-card comments. Roughly 2.5 million teachers in the United States currently use the platform: “We have reason to believe that there is a MagicSchool user in every school district in the country,” Adeel Khan, the company's founder, told me. I tried out the platform for myself: One tool generated a sixth-grade algebra problem about tickets for Taylor Swift's Eras tour: “If the price increased at a constant rate, what was the slope (rate of change) in dollars per day?” Another, “Teacher Jokes,” was underwhelming. I asked for a joke on the Cold War for 11th graders: “Why did the Cold War never get hot?” the bot wrote. “Because they couldn't agree on a temperature!”



So far, much AI experimentation in the classroom has been small-scale, driven by tech-enthusiastic instructors such as Hubbard. This spring, she fed her course material into an AI tool to produce a short podcast on thermodynamics. Her students then listened as invented hosts discussed the laws of energy transfer. “The AI says something that doesn't make sense,” she told her students. “See if you can listen for that.” But some school districts are going all in on AI. Miami's public-school system, the third-largest in the country, initially banned the use of chatbots. Over the past year, the district reversed course, rolling out Google's Gemini chatbot to high-school classrooms where teachers are now using it to role-play historical figures and provide students with tutoring and instant feedback on assignments. Although AI initiatives at the district level target mostly middle- and high-school students, adults are also bringing the technology to the classrooms of younger children. This past year, Iowa made an AI-powered reading tutor available to all state elementary schools; elsewhere, chatbots are filling in for school-counselor shortages.

Many schools still have bans on AI tools. A recent study on how kids are using AI in 20 states across the South and Midwest found that rural and lower-income students were least likely to say their schools permit AI use. The Houston Independent School District (HISD) offers one case study in what can go wrong when AI enters the classroom. This past school year, the district's curricula were seemingly tainted with AI slop, according to parents. In February, eighth graders viewed a slideshow depicting AI-generated art mimicking the style of the Harlem Renaissance. According to an op-ed in the Houston Chronicle written by two HISD parents, students were also given error-laden worksheets (one, on transportation technology, depicted a mix between a car and a chariot that was pulled by a horse with three back legs) and inscrutable discussion questions (“What is the exclamation point(s) to something that surprised you,” one asked). An HISD spokesperson told me that the Harlem Renaissance images were indeed AI-generated using Canva, a graphic-design tool; he was unable to confirm whether AI was used in the other examples.

None of this is slowing AI's rollout in schools. This spring, President Donald Trump signed an executive order promoting AI use in the classroom with the goal of training teachers to integrate “AI into all subject areas” so that kids gain an expertise in AI “from an early age.” The White House's push to incorporate AI in K–12 education has repeatedly emphasized public-private partnerships, a call that tech companies already appear to be embracing. Last month, Microsoft pledged to give more than $4 billion toward advancing AI education across K–12 schools, community and technical colleges, and nonprofits. The same week as Microsoft's announcement, the American Federation of Teachers, one of the country's largest teachers unions, announced a $23 million partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic. One of the partnership's first efforts is a “National Academy for AI Instruction,” opening in New York City this fall, where instructors will learn how to use AI for generating lesson plans and other tasks. The program then plans to expand nationally to reach 10 percent of U.S. teachers over the next five years.



Schools are stuck in a really confusing place. Everyone seems to agree that education needs an upgrade for the AI era. “Our students right now are going to be put at a disadvantage internationally if we don't evolve,” Miguel Cardona, Joe Biden's education secretary, told me. But no one seems to agree on what those changes should look like. Since ChatGPT's release, the in-class essay, the oral exam, blue-book exams, and even cursive have all made something of a comeback in certain classrooms, in an effort to prevent students from outsourcing all their writing and thinking to AI. At the same time, AI aims to make work more efficient—which is exactly what students are using it for. In that sense, whether kids using AI on their homework counts as cheating is “almost a semantic issue,” argues Alex Kotran, a co-founder of the AI Education Project, a nonprofit focused on AI literacy. Of course, try telling that to a concerned parent.



As Kotran points out, a middle ground exists between pretending students aren't using AI and encouraging them to rely on it nonstop. “Even if you believe that everybody is going to be using AI in the future,” he told me, “it doesn't necessarily follow that the top priority should be getting students hands-on right away.” Imagine if in 2007, schools had decided that the best way to prepare kids for the future was to force every student to spend all day in front of an iPhone. No matter what teachers', students', and parents' attitudes about AI in the classroom are, though, it's a reality they have to deal with. The path that schools take from here has direct implications for the future of AI more generally. The more reliant kids are on the technology now, the larger a role AI will play in their lives later. Once schools go all in, there's no turning back.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Donald Trump badly wants a deal to end the war in Ukraine. What is he willing to give up?

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

Vladimir Putin has had a tough few months. His military's much-feared summer offensive has made incremental gains in Ukraine but not nearly the advances he had hoped. His economy has sputtered. Donald Trump has grown fed up with Putin's repeated defiance of his calls for a cease-fire and, for the first time, has targeted the Russian president with consistently harsh rhetoric. Last week, Trump slapped one of Russia's major trading partners, India, with sanctions.

Putin needs to buy time to change the trajectory of the conflict. So the former KGB spymaster has given Trump something that the U.S. president has wanted for months: a one-on-one summit to discuss the end of the conflict. Trump leaped at the chance. But as the two men prepare to meet in Alaska on Friday, foreign-policy experts—and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky—are warning that Trump could be walking into a trap that the Russian leader is setting on American soil.

“Putin has already won. He is the leader of a rogue state, and he'll get a picture on U.S. soil with the president of the United States,” John Bolton, one of Trump's former national security advisers, told me. “Trump wants a deal. And if he can't get one now, he may walk away from it entirely.”

Putin has shown no sign of compromising his positions. His demands to reach an end to hostilities remain maximalist: He wants Russia to keep the territory it conquered, and Ukraine to forgo the security guarantees that could prevent Moscow from attacking again. Those terms are nonstarters for Ukraine and the European nations that have rallied to its defense.

Having promised an end to the war during his campaign, Trump, above all, is desperate for the fighting to stop, and observers fear that, as a result, he might agree to Putin's terms regardless of what Ukraine wants. Trump has already said in recent days that Russia and Ukraine will need to “swap lands” (without specifying which ones). But it is not clear that Russia is willing to give up anything. And if Zelensky were to reject a deal, no matter how one-sided it might be, in Trump's mind, Kyiv would suddenly be the primary obstacle to peace. That could lead Trump to once again unleash his wrath on Zelensky, with potentially disastrous consequences for Ukraine's ability to keep fighting the war.

Read: Trump invites Putin to set foot in America

“Clearly Putin's strategy is to delay and play the president: string him along, concede nothing, exclude Zelensky,” Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who sits on the Armed Services Committee, told me. “My preeminent fear is a bad deal that Zelenksy rejects, and then he becomes the bad guy, and that then Trump, once again in his classic mixture of vengeance and vanity, will turn against Ukraine.”

Trump has made clear that he wants peace. He also wants a Nobel Peace Prize. Several of his closest allies have told me that the fact that President Barack Obama received one infuriates Trump. He has taken to declaring that he has “ended six wars” in his second term. Fact-checkers say this claim is exaggerated, though it's true that his administration has focused on global hot spots in recent weeks, receiving acclaim for brokering peace agreements between Cambodia and Thailand, India and Pakistan, and Azerbaijan and Armenia. The world's most high-profile conflicts, in Gaza and in Ukraine, however, have only escalated in recent months. The situation in Gaza appears to be deteriorating, and Trump has not done anything to stop Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's controversial plan to occupy Gaza.

So Trump sees an opportunity with Ukraine. The bloodiest war in Europe since World War II has become deadlier this year, and the warring sides have expanded their arsenals with weapons capable of striking deep into enemy territory.

The White House dismissed the notion that Trump could be outfoxed by Putin. “What have any of these so-called foreign policy ‘experts' ever accomplished in their lives, other than criticizing Donald Trump?” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told me in a statement. “President Trump has solved seven global conflicts in six months, and he has made extensive progress in ending the Russia-Ukraine War, which he inherited from our foolish previous president, Joe Biden.” Some Trump allies believe that he will stand up to Putin, and that he is appropriately skeptical of the Russian leader. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, for instance, invoked the Cold War when he posted on social media on Friday that he was “confident President Trump will walk away – like Reagan – if Putin insists on a bad deal.”

Trump has been burned by Putin before. In recent months, the president has complained that Putin would tell him one thing in their phone calls and then act entirely differently on the battlefield. Trump reiterated that complaint to reporters yesterday at the White House. “I believe he wants to get it over with,” Trump said of Putin. “Now, I've said that a few times, and I've been disappointed. Because I'd have a good call with him and then missiles would be lobbed into Kyiv or some other place, and you'd have 60 people laying on a road dying.”

The summit was thrown together so quickly that, with days to go, U.S. officials are still scrambling to finalize the details. Trump yesterday characterized the summit as “a feel-out meeting,” perhaps hinting that no final deal would be reached in Alaska. That was taken as a hopeful sign by some who are skeptical of having the summit at all. “The least-bad outcome is that the men would have an exchange of views, but that Trump would stay noncommittal and no deal would be reached. That would be okay, even perhaps a small first step,” Richard Haass, who worked in three Republican administrations before leading the Council on Foreign Relations, told me. “The fear is that the president wants an agreement too much and will carry far too much of Moscow's water.”

But if history is any indication, Putin might be able to use the summit to again curry Trump's favor. Several times in both his first and second terms, Trump followed up a meeting or call with Putin by repeating Kremlin talking points. Most infamously, this occurred during a 2018 summit with Putin in Helsinki, when I asked Trump if he believed U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russia had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. And yesterday, after Putin had signaled his interest in the summit, Trump took a swipe at Zelensky, who has strenuously objected to giving any territory to Russia and has noted that the Ukrainian constitution requires that any cessation of land must be done by national vote.“I get along with Zelensky. But you know, I disagree with what he's done. Very, very severely disagree. This is a war that should have never happened,” Trump told reporters in the White House briefing room. “I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelensky was saying, ‘Well, I have to get constitutional approval.' I mean, he's got approval to go into war and kill everybody.”

Tom Nichols: It was an ambush

Since his blow-up with Trump in the Oval Office in February and Washington's brief pause on intelligence sharing with Kyiv, Zelensky has tried to remain on Trump's good side, with some success. He managed to secure a positive one-on-one meeting with Trump on the sidelines of Pope Francis's funeral at the Vatican in late April. And he has refrained from criticizing the president by name when voicing reservations about U.S. policy toward Ukraine, including a weapons pause in June. Although he has expressed dismay at being excluded from the Alaska summit, Zelensky has not gone after Trump. “We understand Russia's intention to try to deceive America—we will not allow this,” Zelensky said in an address to his nation on Sunday.

Originally, Trump agreed to the Putin summit under the condition that a second meeting would be held with both Putin and Zelensky. But the Kremlin balked at that plan, and Trump dropped it. Trump said yesterday that he would instead brief European leaders shortly after the summit, potentially even from Air Force One on the flight back to Washington. He also will partake in a virtual meeting with leaders, including Zelensky, this week before heading to Alaska.

Europe has watched the summit run-up warily. Several European nations have vowed to fortify Ukraine with weapons if the United States bows out of the conflict. Vice President J. D. Vance, one of the administration's loudest isolationist voices, this weekend declared, “We're done with the funding of the Ukraine war business” and said the United States would soon only be willing to sell arms to Europe to give to Ukraine. But Europe seems unlikely to be able to sustain the level of arms and intelligence that Ukraine would need to defend itself. And if Putin manages to secure a victory in Ukraine, he could soon look to expand his war aims elsewhere.

All of which heightens the stakes of the summit in Alaska. “Putin kept pushing Trump and eventually went further than Trump was willing to be pushed. He got mad, so Putin gave him this summit,” Bolton told me. “Now he wants to work his KGB magic on Trump and get him back in line.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

﻿The US loves to hate cheaters. The reasons why tell us a lot about how we view marriage.

Americans have long considered cheating one of the worst things you can do to another person that doesn't end in jail time.

We witnessed the ire that messing around incites second and third hand in July, when a kiss cam caught the now-infamous Coldplay CEO (not his legal name) and his fellow Coldplay-loving coworker canoodling during a concert at Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts. After being spotted, the pair quickly separated and ducked, leaving frontman Chris Martin to speculate that they were having an affair. The video quickly became national news, with sleuths revealing the people's real names (Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot), job titles (CEO and head of HR, respectively), and the company they work for (Astronomer, a data platform company). Online vigilantes found and descended on their spouses. Somehow, Martin's own ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow got involved (as part of a joke, not the affair).

Byron and Cabot's affair contained a mash of scandalous elements, but there's another reason why it has brought about the swiftest stripe of internet justice seen in recent memory: Americans love an uncomplicated story about a perceived moral failing. Nothing, therefore, brings us together quite like cheating.

We like when cheaters get caught. We like when cheaters have to pay. We like when cheaters get what we think they deserve. We like the Coldplay cheaters because we really don't like dealing with the concept that infidelity is much more complicated than we want it to be.

Despite the raft of changes that have come for American relationships — the advent of feminism, the rise and fall of divorce, the burgeoning world of open marriages — and the bare fact that sneaking around isn't uncommon, adultery is still the big bad thing we can all agree on. Why, exactly?

There's no question about it — getting cheated on can be horrible: heartbreaking, destabilizing, earth-shattering, wildly unfun. Unsurprisingly, cheating's approval numbers are incredibly low.

Since 2001, Gallup has surveyed Americans about behaviors they find immoral, and cheating has consistently been in the gutter, neck and neck with “cloning humans” as 89 percent of respondents in 2025 said it's “morally wrong.” That percentage is the same as when the survey was first conducted 24 years ago — it's risen (as high as 93 percent) and fallen, but the lowest that figure has ever been was still 85 percent of respondents declaring cheating unacceptable back in 2023.

We can see this attitude in our simple aphorisms — “If they'll cheat with you, they'll cheat on you,” “Once a cheater, always a cheater” — in our Reddit threads, and in our TikTok trends.

Americans' harsh judgment about adultery in general is tied to Americans' surprising static view of marriage. Even though so much — the age when we marry, who we marry, rates of matrimony and divorce — has shifted over the past several decades, marriage is still largely a revered institution, tied to unique legal and financial protections.

“In the US, marriage is still largely seen as the be-all, end-all, final and only relationship form,” says Alexandra Solomon, a professor at Northwestern University and psychologist specializing in relationships. This mentality often sees commitment as synonymous with monogamy, and commitment as a path to marriage.

Solomon cited countries in Western Europe as examples of places that are more relaxed than the US. Compared to the US, many people living in western European and Scandinavian countries have more diverse views of what marriages constitute and what relationships look like, from a fully committed, monogamous coupling with cohabitation and a blending of finances that never results in marriage to a marriage with consensual non-monogamy, or even just a marriage later in life, perhaps post-children. It's not that adultery can't or doesn't occur in these relationships, but it isn't seen as character failure. Extramarital affairs aren't tethered to one's moral standing; non-monogamy isn't a sign of moral failure.

“When you hold marriage up as this pinnacle, a moral pinnacle,” as Americans do, Solomon explains, “you also set yourself up to hold infidelity as the pinnacle of betrayal.”

It's worth keeping in mind that Americans might also be hypocrites.

Roughly one in three couples in the US experiences infidelity, according to research compiled by the Gottman Institute, an organization that counsels couples and trains relationship therapists. Additionally, a 2025 YouGov US survey found that 53 percent of respondents said they had been cheated on, with 33 percent responding they had been the cheater. Suffice it to say, these numbers might be an undercount given that many people may be reticent to divulge a potentially embarrassing and intimate admission to another human, let alone a pollster.

That said, what these findings do tell us is that the majority of Americans consider adultery “morally wrong,” and there are still plenty who do cheat. Statistically, we have to infer that some Americans believe cheating is morally wrong and do it anyway. How do we reconcile this tension?

“Infidelity exists in a world of contradictions,” Paul Keable, the chief strategy officer at Ashley Madison and an expert on the subject of contemporary adultery, tells Vox. Ashley Madison is infamous for its mission to discreetly connect people looking to cheat with one another and its cheeky motto: “Life is short. Have an affair.”

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Keable, who is Canadian, believes the American relationship to cheating doesn't make much sense on paper, but he compares us children who hate to be told “no.” The more you tell kids that they shouldn't, say, touch a hot stove, the more inclined they are to put their hand on it. Adults, who are children but older, ostensibly burned their fingers and learned not to grab at hot metal years ago, but failed to extrapolate the bigger lessons about things they're not supposed to do.

There are also apparently smaller paradoxes within this contradiction-hypocrisy umbrella theory. Keable says some of the users on his site cheat to save their “sexless, orgasm-less marriages.” Keable concedes that conversations about non-monogamy and divorce or separation may happen, particularly among young millennial and Gen Z couples. Still, citing fragile egos and gender roles, he believes many still don't take the option that respects a partner and spares them hurt.

He also says that the most vocal anti-adultery advocates tend to be the biggest cheaters, and right now that's good for business. Keable notes that tradwife and family influencer content emphasizes conservative, conventional ideas about marriage and puts regressive gender roles on a pedestal. The more people buy into this content, the more potential customers Keable envisions.

Keable said that after the Coldplay CEO fallout, Ashley Madison saw a surge of new signups, averaging 36,000 in the week following compared to the regular average of 20,000. Keable surmises there will be enough contradiction and hypocrisy in the US to sustain Ashley Madison's business in the coming years.

There's another way to look at Americans' elastic relationship to the morality of infidelity. As Keable notes, the moment an affair involves people we know (perhaps even ourselves), we're a lot more understanding. Suddenly, it all becomes more complicated. And “knowing” someone is pretty elastic, too. One need not look any further than celebrity infidelity scandals to see how differently they're treated.

The public reaction to both real and imagined celebrity infidelity often tilts more gleeful and humorous. Take for example, the story of two star-crossed Good Morning America anchors, both married, which was embraced by fans and tabloids alike. We saw the same energy — even if unfulfilled by the actual players — brought to discussions of the on-set chemistry between Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, or Kerry Washington and Tony Goldwyn, whose Scandal act some hoped to be real. While Ariana Grande and her new boyfriend, Ethan Slater, received some blowback, the overarching reaction to their synchronized spousal abandonment was muted. Like the Coldplay cheats, these stories involve ideas about workplace romances between people with significant others.

“Even though we, in the abstract, hate infidelity, there may be times in some of our own lives where we may have forgiven people,” Solomon says.

With some celebs, we've created narratives about them, imagined who they really are and what they're really like. Every parasocial wrinkle becomes something that makes them more human in our eyes. They can remind us of family members, friends, and even ourselves. Because they do, we give them humanity and grace that we aren't quick to offer strangers — even though these famous people are indeed strangers.

“The Coldplay couple, we have no backstory, so it's very easy to vilify both of them,” Solomon says, pointing out that people quickly jumped onto the narrative that both were betraying their spouses. Granted, the way Byron and Cabot reacted, they were caught red-handed. But there wasn't any room made to consider other possibilities (e.g., being in an open relationship, being camera shy, going into hiding for a totally different reason) before the chase to find out every detail about them began.

“They're less sympathetic to us because we don't know them and we can't put ourselves into the narrative,” Solomon adds. It all comes back to the stories we like to tell ourselves.

It's worth noting, though, that not all celebrities get off so easily — especially men who have made their marriage part of their appeal.

Perhaps the simple story Americans tell ourselves about cheating being flatly unforgivable (until the GMA anchors do it) is for sanity's sake. Infidelity hinges upon trust, a thing so special that we only allow certain people in our lives to have it. When trust is betrayed, it opens up a world of other anxieties — a debilitating number of what-if scenarios and doubts come into play. So why not just lock that person out, before they can hurt again?

That narrative almost always places us as the wronged party. Cheating, in the public imagination, always happens to us. We don't like to picture ourselves doing adultery, committing betrayal, and asking for forgiveness. “Adulterer” isn't an identity many people claim, and for good reason.

“Most people are not serial betrayers,” Carrie Cole, a counselor and the research director for the Gottman Institute, tells me.

Cole, who's studied and counseled couples through affair recovery, tells me that while people are no doubt capable of being deceptive and manipulative, she also sees many cheating partners find themselves embarrassed, ashamed, and guilty about the damage they caused. She also said that while options like an open marriage or divorce might seem like clear, more respectful options instead of adultery — a common refrain is that having all these alternatives makes cheating ostensibly more painful — affairs can happen in all kinds of relationships, no matter the rules of that relationship. Some people who have affairs are likely going against their own morals and values.

Understanding what drives people to infidelity is probably more useful than writing them off as human beings.

Cole referenced the book Not Just Friends by the late Shirley Glass, which explains that cheating is more complex than we like to think — infidelity is not just a calculus of lies and sex. Glass, who was a psychologist, theorized that sometimes infidelity can begin with making small, seemingly harmless emotional connections, getting caught up and not creating boundaries. The point is not that this is excusable, but that sometimes the “why” or “how” of infidelity can be a bit more complicated than we like to think.

Examining why people cheat and what humans seek in infidelity is also at the core of psychotherapist Esther Perel's work. Whether it's feelings of being trapped in the role of a doting mother or a lack of physical intimacy, Perel posits that affairs can show us things, perhaps even desires, that are missing in relationships and marriages. Perel poses questions about the magnitude of our morals and desires, why we hold these beliefs (e.g. marriage equals transparency and monogamy) so strongly. She shows couples that it's possible to come back from this kind of violation.

Just because Americans see infidelity as an explicit transgression doesn't mean it shouldn't be examined. Our mistakes can tell us about who we are, no matter how much we dislike said mistakes. Perhaps this is why so many people are reluctant to forgive or extend empathy to cheaters. It's much easier to write someone off when we think we could never be like them.

”I obviously don't condone anyone having an affair, but it's very easy to sit in judgment, in condemnation of one” Cole says. “It's sometimes not as clear-cut and simple as what people want to make it to be.”

Within a narrative like that of the Coldplay cheaters, whatever complex anxieties and feelings we have about trust in relationships get flattened into something deliriously simple. The alternative — hard-won sympathy, the possibility for forgiveness, empathizing with the pain of everyone involved — is a lot less entertaining and more somber than the Philly Phanatic reenacting the most humiliating moment of someone's life.

The truth is, there's a disconnect between what Americans believe about “cheaters” and how we think about ourselves and the people we're sympathetic to. In the US, there's a dogmatic understanding of matrimony that necessarily can't apply to all the many, many marriages out there, and a culture that clings to the roots of that institution even as it changes. Despite it all, there are capacities for shame, forgiveness, and redemption. We just don't seem to want to make room for them.

A story that complicated wouldn't be nearly as effective in bringing us all together.

Today's trend goes back way further than the modern influencer.

“Wellness” is a word influencers use as a hashtag on videos of them pouring collagen into smoothies and as the theme of a celebrity chef's new cookbook. It's even an obsession of the US health secretary. But what does it mean to be well? That's the question we answer this week on Explain It to Me, Vox's call-in podcast that answers the questions that matter to you most.

While the multibillion-dollar industry feels new, it's been over a century in the making. Jonathan Stea, a clinical psychologist and author of Mind the Science: Saving Your Mental Health From the Wellness Industry, says that a lot of wellness trends fill in gaps in health care. That cold plunge or super food may be harmless, but often the science behind the trends can be iffy. “The problem is that one of the ways in which wellness promoters market their materials is by promoting quote-unquote ‘science' or ‘research' to support their claims,” he says. “When you do a deeper dive into that research, what people will often find is that you can find a study to promote or to support any kind of treatment or claim.”

How did the wellness trend even begin in the first place? And how should we be thinking about our health overall? Below is an excerpt of our conversation with Stea, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

Where did wellness originate?

We can trace the modern wellness industry back to about the late 19th century. That's when two prominent figures really played a role in shaping the modern wellness industry we see today. One of those players was a guy named John Harvey Kellogg. And what he and his brother Will Keith did is, they built something called the Battle Creek Sanitarium, which was a really huge famous medical center. It was a spa, it was a grand hotel, and it attracted a lot of wealthy, highly influential people. And what John ended up doing in that center was promoting a lot of his ideas about health and about how to treat diseases. They tended to really blend a lot of what he called Biologic Living, which is really just a kind of virtuous way of approaching our health and kind of blending that with some religious Christian beliefs.

When I hear the name Kellogg, I admit that I think of my breakfast cereal. Was John Kellogg a scientist or an inventor of some kind? 

Kind of, yes. So his brother Will Keith actually started the cereal company. John was a physician, and he was a bestselling author. He had a magazine; he did lectures. His magazine was followed by millions of people.

So was he the inventor of wellness as we know it today? 

Not quite. When he was promoting his ideas, it was before the term wellness as we use it today was formed. He was promoting a precursor to wellness called Biologic Living, which essentially promoted the idea that all diseases in all health conditions can be treated with basically a trifecta recipe of good sleep, good exercise, and eating a specific diet: vegetables and fruits, etc.

Exercise, diet, sleep, eating fruits and veggies — that feels like something I hear from my doctor. 

Totally. That's a part of evidence-based care, and that's really foundational to what we do in the hospital. The problem is that what we see even in the modern wellness industry is when people sell these things as a cure-all, as a panacea for all health conditions.

John had a lot of ideas that [suggested] if we weren't following a trifecta recipe of sleep, eating well, and exercise, and we were doing other things like drinking alcohol or eating meat or sugar, or even if people were overweight — he considered that to be non-virtuous, and essentially really bad behaviors. And he would view it in a very punitive way. Even masturbation was considered self-abuse by John Kellogg, and he thought that it would lead to things like mental illness and cancer and moral destitution. He would advocate treating people who would masturbate — in boys, he would recommend circumcision or bandaging their hands together, and in girls, he would recommend [applying] pure carbolic acid to the clitoris. And even its removal.

Was John Kellogg the only person like this of his time, or was this more widespread? 

It was more widespread, and I would say that he was one of the most prominent ones. There was another huge player that played a role in the birth of the modern wellness industry: He was a guy named Bernarr MacFadden, who some consider the 20th century's first celebrity health influencer. This guy was equally eccentric to John. Macfadden would strut around New York barefoot so that his soles could absorb the earth's energy, and he would sleep on the floor so that his energy would align with the earth's natural magnetic rhythm. And he was very hostile to vaccines.

So you're telling me that an anti-vaxx wellness influencer is not a new phenomenon. 

Very old, over a century old. Similar to Kellogg, you know, Macfadden would also sell this idea of health as a moral virtue, where it's all about virtuous eating. It's all about virtuous exercise. And the problem with these ideas is that health is not a moral virtue. What these ideas do is they promote an idea about health that ignores the science. And then they downplay the role of other important things that we know play a role in health, like genetics, social factors, and just plain old bad luck.

It's very interesting that all of this happened in the 19th century. I think of that as a time with a lot of advancements in science and in health. 

Totally. Around the same time that these wellness ideas were percolating, there was also something called the Flexner Report of 1910, and that really ushered in the dawn of modern medicine. What that report did was it essentially wanted medicine and medical schools to get their act together and make them much more scientific. It would encourage schools to either get rid of alternative medicine from their curriculum or just shut these schools down altogether. At the same time, [the report] really disadvantaged folks who were economically underprivileged. And what that did is it opened [a space] for alternative medicine or wellness to step in and to take on the role of listening, humanizing, and comfort.

What about the term wellness specifically, though? When did that officially become a thing? 

Some consider the father of the modern wellness industry to be Halbert Dunn. He was a biostatistician, and he first used the term wellness as we use it today, publishing an article in the Canadian Journal of Public Health in 1959. What Dunn did is he distinguished good health, which he defined as freedom from illness, from what he dubbed high-level wellness, which is a kind of optimal functioning in one's environment. And I think his definition was quite thoughtful, but it really didn't stick.

The problem is that from there, the term wellness quickly took on a life of its own. And nowadays, in many parts of North America, wellness is everywhere and anywhere, and the definition has really ballooned to include anything and everything. If we ask one wellness guru to define wellness, we'll hear a different answer from another one.

Israelis want to end the war — but not out of concern for Palestinian suffering.

How do Israelis feel about the increasingly horrifying crimes their government is committing in Gaza?

This is one of the key questions going forward. Israel is a (teetering) democracy with elections scheduled for next year. The public's attitudes could — by putting pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition — play a major role in determining if, and when, we get a durable ceasefire. And yet, polling presents a somewhat confusing picture of their view on the war.

Surveys have consistently found 1) a majority of Israelis want a ceasefire to end the war, and 2) a majority of the Israeli population feels little concern about suffering among Gazan civilians. While Israelis have mostly shrugged off international condemnation of its conduct, the past week has seen a surge in antiwar activism, largely prompted by mass opposition to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to occupy Gaza City.

To make sense of this, I called up Dahlia Scheindlin, one of Israel's leading pollsters and author of an excellent recent book on Israeli democracy.

Scheindlin told me that Israeli opposition to the war is rooted in self-interest: a belief that continued fighting in Gaza is unnecessarily risking the lives of hostages (about 20 of whom are believed to be alive) and Israeli soldiers. Thus, opposition to the war is deepening while Israelis remain — on the whole — indifferent to the suffering of Gazans.

Beyond describing those beliefs, Scheindlin explained where they come from in Israeli society. She got into the deep roots of dehumanization on both sides of the conflict, the conspiracy theory shaping ordinary Israelis' views of starvation in Gaza, and why her time working in post-war Serbia made her more somewhat more optimistic about the chances that there could one day be real peace.

A transcript of our conversation follows, edited for length and clarity.

I want to start with a poll result that I found horrifying: 79 percent of Israeli Jews did not feel personally troubled by reports of starvation in Gaza. Do those results seem right to you, based on your broader read of the data? And what does this kind of poll say about the Israeli mindset?

Yeah, it absolutely strikes me as correct. There's a general trend [in polls] of a very strong majority of Israeli Jews expressing not only lack of empathy but belligerence and hostility towards Gazans, including civilians.

I do think we need to put it in the context of everybody else here. There are parallel trends of deep, deep hostility that we had seen already in joint Israeli-Palestinian survey research done before the war. Very hostile attitudes between the two populations definitely predate October 7.

The reason I asked specifically about Israeli Jews — though parallel trends of hostility is obviously hugely important in understanding the situation — is that their views are especially urgent amid the overwhelming evidence that the Israeli government's policy has created a starvation crisis. It is, I think, very difficult for people outside Israel to understand why that doesn't break through in its politics.

How is it that, when it seems like your government is committing such a crime, people aren't horrified? Is just dehumanization all the way down — that they think Palestinians deserve it? Or is there denial of what's clearly happening? Is there lack of coverage or censorship in the Israeli media?

It's all of those things.

Israeli media, as you pointed out, is barely covering civilian suffering in Gaza — which is not much of an excuse to be honest, because all of the information is available.

Polls have tested whether Israelis believe the starvation was happening. A recent survey found that 47 percent of all Israelis felt that it was probably lies and made up. Now, if it's 47 percent of the average, it's in the mid-to-upper 50 percent range among Jews — as presumably very few Palestinian citizens of Israel feel that way.

So 47 percent said it's not true; it's Hamas's lies. And another 18 percent said, “Even if it's true, I'm not bothered by it.”

Israelis are completely consumed with the hostages. It is front and center; it's everywhere. The country is flooded with hostage symbols: signs, slogans, pins. Everyone wears a pin, including the prime minister.

The second thing they're consumed with is the fate of their sons, brothers, husbands, fathers who are serving in Gaza.

Basically, the Israeli Jewish public thinks the war needs to stop — but because it's hurting them and not because it's hurting Palestinians.

Yes, that is correct.

There is a small portion of people who are increasingly troubled by the situation in Gaza — primarily the left, which represents about 20 percent of Israelis. Among the Jewish population, it's about 12 percent to 14 percent. So, it's a minority, but those people are troubled enough that some of them have begun making that a much more central part of their public activity.

I'm a little bit skeptical of making it seem like there's sweeping growing trends [toward public outcry about Gazan suffering]. There are demonstrations of people holding posters of children who've been killed in Gaza and also of people going to Air Force bases in Israel to hold those posters and say, “Don't go.” There were two people who burst into a reality TV show — you know, primetime television — a couple days ago and screamed, “Stop the war.” Is it growing? I don't know. But it's certainly becoming more urgent, and they're making the claim more publicly, and I think they feel that there's some space to make that claim more publicly.

I think what you hear among a lot of mainstream Israelis — which includes people from the center and even the moderate right — is that, of course, the war is bad for everybody — get our hostages back, our sons back — and it's also bad for Gazans. But [the Gazans] certainly are not a priority.

Many Israelis simply say, “I cannot be sad for the civilians of Gaza,” after what they saw on October 7 and during hostage releases. They were often released with these really grotesque ceremonies and forced to cheer and [surrounded by] mobs.

On one of those days when a hostage was released, I had a friend write to me saying, “You still think there are innocent people in Gaza?” because of the mob.

Now, even if there are thousands of people [jeering at hostages], that's out of 2 million. And, of course, we had thousands of people on the Israeli side who support, you know, terrible things.

But [the imagery] is part of what explains the very dehumanizing attitudes that don't allow for compassion.

Is this psychology part of what allows many Israelis to dismiss the seriousness or significance of the international outrage about Gaza?

They would say that the Europeans or whoever simply don't get it; they haven't been through what we've been through, and they don't understand what it's like here. Or, even more aggressively, that they're either being taken in by Hamas propaganda or are themselves antisemitic. 

What [Israelis] are saying now is, “Everybody forgot about October 7.” They forgot who really started it — because, for a lot of Israelis, everything was sort of manageable before that.

I think that the world hasn't forgotten October 7. They just don't think it's an excuse for what Israel is doing anymore.

Right. 

It's [also] an extremely widespread view here that the entire global media is against Israel because the world — [including] the UN and the international system — is always critical of Israel. And the government is compulsively pushing the line that the rest of the world is just being spoon-fed lies directly by Hamas.

In their defense, there's a grain of truth to that, right? Hamas will lie about things all the time; they're a horrifying organization. 

I know, but the assumption is that there's nobody else getting information out — that there's no Palestinian journalists who are doing their work, that there's no social media, that the international organizations who are there are never getting new information — it's only Hamas, and that international media isn't making any effort to get information from any source other than Hamas, which is just fundamentally factually not true. International media is getting its information from their own stringers and reporters inside Gaza, from credible vetted social media, or international organizations.

If you think that the whole thing is made up, you're looking at a vast conspiracy of collusion between Hamas, observers on the ground, average Palestinians — a huge conspiracy of all of them.

It seems to me that there's a real opportunity here for a politician or political faction in Israel to turn the things that Israelis are mad about — the hostages, soldier casualties — into an indictment of the broader right-wing worldview that is inflicting harm on Palestinians and taking their land is good for Israeli security — to argue that the government's whole theory of the case is a failure, and that a new approach is needed.

And yet, I just have not seen a very successful articulation of an alternative philosophy — one that has caught fire and become really powerful in Israeli politics — since October 7. The public opinion groundwork is there, but politicians aren't taking advantage of it.

You're absolutely right; politicians aren't taking advantage of it. Nobody's really making a case for an alternative. The opposition [parties are] maddeningly focused on criticizing; all of the critical points that you and I have just raised are out there. But nobody connects the dots and says, “Here is an alternative. Here's what we would do differently.”

Everybody limits themselves saying, for example, what we would do differently on a hostage deal. It's never about the bigger vision: How do you envision Israel ending this war and preventing the next war?

I can tell you, from politicians' perspective, it's because they know that, on a deeper level, Israelis are right-wing. [About] 60 percent of Jewish Israelis self-identify as right-wing. They don't want a Palestinian state, and they don't want to hear about a negotiated solution, and they don't want to hear about concessions.

So, that's why the opposition politicians don't want to get into it, because they have forgotten that leadership means courage — that leadership means leading, not following. They're basically just cowards running after a very simplistic reading of public opinion. Even scratching one level below the surface, they would know that you can change public opinion over time.

We've seen repeatedly, over a decade, that the public changes its mind slowly and incrementally, but significantly, on issues related to conflict resolution or negotiations, concessions, final status — especially when they see it as a realistic possibility, and especially when their leadership is behind it and makes the case.

I know from personal experience doing public opinion polling for Prime Minister Ehud Barak during the Camp David negotiations [the US-led peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians] in the year 2000. I was literally conducting the research, watching the focus groups, looking at the data through every night or almost every night of that negotiation, and people were changing their minds — slowly, but very steadily considering how compressed it was — over extremely controversial things. Did they love it? No, but they were moving.

When we try to tell people in polls, “Here are the advantages [of peace],” they can change their minds a little bit — but it's so remote from their experience, so hypothetical. There's no anchor in reality. If politicians were getting behind this, they would be able to create that kind of momentum.

That's a bit grim, right? 

I thought my previous analysis was extremely optimistic.

What I'm saying is that public opinion can change. The conditions are that there are some realistic policy grounds for a change in the situation and legitimate leaders who are advocating for it. And those two things are not impossible.

Well, they're just not there now, though. That's why I said it's grim. 

Right now, sure. However, we have elections coming up; we're heading into an election year in 2026. [It's] very unlikely before then, but possibly. And all polls are showing opportunity is there, and the Netanyahu government has not been able to win a majority in any credible survey.

It could still happen that Netanyahu wins again, but it's also possible that a different government might have a little bit less acumen at spinning the world around their finger — and even start feeling some pressure from the world to move towards two states.

So, then, let me ask one long-term question. There's a line from the writer Omar El Akkad that I can't really get out of my head. I'm sure you've heard it.

“One day, everyone will have always been against this.”

Exactly. Do you think that's true when it comes to Israel? That one day, Israelis who supported the war will say, “I never could have supported that”?

I think that this collective sense of regret — the rewriting of history whereby everybody was against it — is probably the exception more than the rule.

I worked in various countries in the Balkans from roughly 2006 to 2010. What I saw there is that every side thought that they got the short end of the deal. Every side thought that the world was against them. Every side was embittered.

But particularly the Serbian side, which I know better and was also viewed as the aggressor. I pretty much never encountered anybody who thought that they did the wrong thing other than losing. I'll never forget the taxi driver who said, “You know, we lost Bosnia, we lost Kosovo, we lost everything.” And that — [not the genocide] — was his major regret.

Yet, peace between Serbia and both Bosnia and Kosovo seems to be holding.

That's part of another developing hypothesis I have — which I haven't proved — but maybe somebody's investigated. I think there is a habitation factor to both violence and nonviolence. The longer you experience nonviolence, the harder it becomes to break it — even if you kind of still hate each other.

So, no, I'm not waiting for Israelis and Palestinians to love each other. We don't have the luxury of waiting for that.

﻿The question is whether a Republican judiciary will read the entire law governing Trump's power over DC, or just the part that Trump likes.

On Monday, President Donald Trump released an executive order invoking a rarely used federal law that allows him to temporarily seize control over Washington, DC's police force. Later the same day, DC's Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser seemed to concede that there's nothing she can do about it.

“What I would point you to is the Home Rule Charter that gives the president the ability to determine the conditions of an emergency,” Bowser said Monday afternoon. “We could contest that, but the authority is pretty broad.”

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Bowser is almost certainly correct that Trump can seize control of her city's police force, at least for a little while.

The District of Columbia is not a state, and does not enjoy the same control over its internal affairs that, say, nearby Virginia or Maryland does. The Constitution gives Congress the power to “exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever” over the nation's capital. If Congress wanted to, it could turn DC into a federal protectorate tomorrow.

In 1974, however, Congress enacted the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which generally gives DC residents the power to elect the city's leaders. But that law contains an exception that allows the president to briefly take command of DC's police.

“Whenever the President of the United States determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for federal purposes,” the law provides, the president may require the city's mayor to provide him “such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate.”

The same law, however, also provides that presidential control over DC police must terminate after 30 days, unless Congress takes some action to extend it. So, assuming that the courts actually apply this 30-day limit to Trump, Trump's control over DC's local police will only last a month at most.

Indeed, Trump's own executive order seems to acknowledge that his powers are time-limited. The order requires Mayor Bowser to “provide the services of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act.”

The Home Rule Act, moreover, is fairly adamant that this 30-day limit is real. It provides that, absent congressional action, “no such services made available pursuant to the direction of the President … shall extend for any period in excess of 30 days.” So, if Trump does try to extend the time limit without Congress's consent, the courts should not permit him to do so.

Trump loves to declare emergencies. In his first 100 days in office, he declared eight of them, more than any other president — including himself in his first term. His DC police order is just the latest of these emergency declarations. Trump claims that “crime is out of control in the District of Columbia,” and this supposed situation justifies invoking emergency powers to take control of DC's police.

The idea that DC faces a genuine emergency is a farce. As pretty much everyone who has written about Monday's executive order has noted, violent crime rates in the city are at a 30-year low. So, even if you concede that crime is such a problem in DC that it justifies a federal response, that problem has existed for three decades. A persistent problem is the opposite of an emergency.

That said, Bowser is correct that the Home Rule Act's text permits the president, and the president alone, to determine whether an emergency exists that justifies taking control of DC's police. The relevant language of the statute provides that Trump may invoke this power “whenever the President of the United States determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist.”

Broadly speaking, it makes sense to give the president unreviewable authority to decide when to invoke certain emergency powers. The very nature of an emergency is that it is a sudden event that requires immediate action, without which matters could deteriorate rapidly. Think of a heart attack, a major natural disaster, or an insurrection.

Suppose, for example, that a violent mob attacks the US Capitol during an important national event, such as the congressional certification of a presidential election. When Congress enacted the Home Rule Act, it quite sensibly could have thought that the president should be able to draw upon all nearby law enforcement officers to quell such an attack on the United States — without having to first seek permission from local elected officials, or a judge.

Congress, of course, did not anticipate that the president might be complicit in such an attack. But that doesn't change the fact that the statute says what it says. A nation as large and diverse as the United States cannot function unless its chief executive has the power to take some unilateral actions. If a president abuses that authority, the proper remedy is often supposed to be the next election.

It's worth noting that not every emergency statute is worded as permissively as the Home Rule Act's provision governing local police. In May, for example, a federal court struck down many of the ever-shifting tariffs that Trump imposed during his time back in office. One of the plaintiffs' primary arguments in that case, known as V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, is that Trump illegally tried to use an emergency statute to address an ordinary situation.

Trump primarily relied on a statute known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to justify his tariffs. That law gives him fairly broad authority to “regulate” international transactions, but this power “may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared.”

Thus, the text of IEEPA is quite different from the text of the Home Rule Act. While the Home Rule Act permits the president to act whenever he determines that an emergency exists, IEEPA imposes two conditions on the president. One is that there must be an emergency declaration, but the other is that the president must invoke IEEPA to deal with an actual “unusual and extraordinary threat.”

Trump claims that many of his tariffs are justified because of trade deficits — the United States buys more goods from many nations than it sells — but the US has had trade deficits for at least two decades. So trade deficits are hardly an “unusual and extraordinary threat.”

Some of Trump's invocations of emergency power, in other words, are vulnerable to a legal challenge. But the question of whether any particular invocation may plausibly be challenged in court will turn on the specific wording of individual statutes.

All of this said, the Home Rule Act does contain one very significant limit on presidential power: the 30-day limit. And the statute is quite clear that this limit should not be evaded. Again, it states that “no” services made available to the president “shall extend for any period in excess of 30 days, unless the Senate and the House of Representatives enact into law a joint resolution authorizing such an extension.” (The law also permits Congress to extend this 30-day limit by adjourning “sine die,” meaning that Congress adjourns without formally setting a date for its return, something it typically only does for a brief period every year.)

So what happens if, a month from now, Trump declares a new emergency and tries to seize control of DC's police for another 30 days? If the courts conclude that he can do that, they would make a mockery of the Home Rule Act's text. Presidents should not be allowed to wave away an explicit statutory limit on their authority by photocopying an old executive order and changing the dates.

That said, the Supreme Court is dominated by Republicans who recently held that Trump may use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes. So, while the Home Rule Act is very clear about the 30-day limit on Trump's power, there is no guarantee that this Supreme Court will rule that the law applies to him.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Trump's crime numbers are completely wrong. He's taking over DC police anyway.

Trump finally imposed his new tariffs. Here's what to know.

There's a method to his trade war madness. But major economic and legal risks remain.

Surprise! It probably has nothing to do with saving birds.

The Trump administration is worried, it would seem, about eagles — like, the big birds of prey with sharp talons and famously good eyesight.

Earlier this month, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who oversees endangered species, wrote on X that wind-energy projects kill eagles, including the iconic bald eagle, and his agency would work to protect them from harm.

He even appended a memo to the post that directs the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which falls under Burgum's command, to enforce an existing law called the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act to make sure that these birds are not “sacrificed” for wind power. The law makes killing or harming eagles without a government permit illegal.

One possible interpretation is that Burgum simply cares about birds. Or the bald eagle, anyway, a national symbol.

A more obvious one is that the Trump administration continues to do everything it can to shutter or stall the build-out of US wind farms — which Trump really seems to abhor. That apparently includes suddenly caring about certain wildlife regulations.

To be clear, wind turbines are, in fact, a serious threat to birds of prey, including eagles, and to bats, especially when they're not built or operated with wildlife in mind. Accurate estimates are hard to come by, though it's reasonable to assume that turbine blades kill hundreds of eagles per year nationwide. That number is somewhere around 1 million birds per year if you account for all avian species, according to data scientist Hannah Ritchie.

That being said, a much bigger threat to birds is stray cats, buildings, and cars. Cats, alone, kill as many as 2.4 billion birds per year nationwide. Yes, billion.

And another more serious threat than turbines? Climate change — the very problem that wind energy is helping fix. A landmark 2019 report by the National Audubon Society, a nonprofit bird conservation group, found that rising temperatures put nearly two-thirds of North American bird species at an elevated risk of extinction, including golden eagles.

Finally, there's this: Although bald eagles were once on the brink of extinction, these birds are doing just fine now. Actually more than fine. Between 2009 and 2019, their population in the lower 48 states quadrupled to more than 300,000 individuals, close to historic population estimates. That doesn't include Alaska — home to the largest bald eagle population in the US — where some people consider them pests because they're so abundant.

Bald eagles don't need saving from Trump officials.

The many species that do, meanwhile, are losing protections because of policy decisions by those very same officials. So far, the Trump administration has moved to limit the scope of laws meant to safeguard migratory birds, including eagles, and all federally endangered species, seemingly to loosen restrictions on the oil and gas industry. Separately, in May, the administration took steps to undo federal protections for the lesser prairie-chicken, an imperiled ground bird in Texas that lives atop oil-rich lands. It's also planning to open up eagle-filled wilderness in Alaska to drilling, cut funding for a bird-monitoring program, and log more US forests, which are famously where birds live.

Ironically, it's the policies and programs that Trump officials are now eroding that helped save bald eagles in the first place. So if the administration was serious about helping eagles — or the hundreds of other American bird species, from hummingbirds to owls — it's pretty clear that its actions would look a lot different.

Elon Musk has a bone to pick with Apple.

In a series of tweets late Monday night, Musk said xAI would take legal action against Apple for what he says is its bias toward OpenAI on the App Store.

""Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,"" Musk wrote in an X post. ""xAI will take immediate legal action.""

In a post earlier on Monday, he asked why the App Store hadn't placed X higher in its rankings. Musk said X deserved the spot because it is ""the #1 news app in the world.""

""Are you playing politics? What gives? Inquiring minds want to know,"" Musk wrote.

xAI and Apple didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

At press time, OpenAI's ChatGPT is ranked first on the App Store. Grok is ranked fifth.

""Unfortunately, what choice do we have? Apple didn't just put their thumb on the scale, they put their whole body!"" Musk wrote on X on Monday.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Musk's threats on Monday.

""This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like,"" Altman wrote on X.

Altman said the ChatGPT maker would remain ""focused on making great products.""

But Musk was not done.

""Apple behaves like it's owned by OpenAI — why?"" Musk wrote on X on Tuesday morning. He was responding to a post containing several screenshots of banners from the App Store featuring ChatGPT.

Musk and Altman cofounded OpenAI in 2015. Musk left its board in 2018. Since then, Musk has become a vocal critic of Altman's leadership of OpenAI.

In February 2024, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, accusing it of violating its nonprofit mission when it partnered with Microsoft. He withdrew the lawsuit in June 2024, only to refile it two months later.

Musk has previously leveled criticism at Apple and the App Store. In May 2022, Musk slammed the 30% fee Apple takes from sales on the App Store. Musk said Apple's fee was a ""tax on the Internet"" and ""literally 10 times higher than it should be.""

After acquiring Twitter in October 2022, Musk accused Apple of censorship and monopolistic practices.

""Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. Do they hate free speech in America?"" Musk wrote on X on November 28, 2022.

""Apple has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won't tell us why,"" he wrote in a follow-up post, amid concerns that Musk's loosening of Twitter's content moderation policies could run afoul of Apple's content restrictions.

The dispute was resolved after Musk met with Apple CEO Tim Cook. Musk said in an X post on November 30, 2022, that he had a ""good conversation"" with Cook and that they had ""resolved the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store.""

""Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so,"" Musk said.

The Ukrainian firm Wild Hornets said its Sting interceptor reached up to 195 miles per hour in stable flight — a speed that likely makes the system one of the fastest first-person-view combat drones.

The startup released a video on Monday of the Sting flying over open fields in an apparent test. A speed counter on the drone's first-person-view user interface indicated that the Sting reached up to 315 kilometers per hour, or roughly the top velocity of a standard bullet train.

Business Insider couldn't independently verify the drone's speed.

This is how new STING Shahed drone interceptors are born — now even faster and more powerful 😎🚀 pic.twitter.com/a6aoRsGik2

The announcement comes as the Ukrainian drone industry has been trying for months to push the limits of its FPV interceptors.

Ukrainian units are increasingly looking to these low-cost drones, once a novel concept on the battlefield, as a solution against the Iranian-designed Shahed.

Russia, which manufactures the Shahed locally, has drastically increased the number of these exploding drones it deploys at a time, pairing them with ballistic missiles to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses.

New Russian tactics that allow Shaheds to fly higher and faster have also made it more difficult for machine gun squads, a core pillar of air defense for Ukraine, to hit the loitering munitions reliably.

An interceptor drone's speed is key because the uncrewed system must be fast enough to catch up to the Shahed. The Shahed-136, the standard loitering munition used in Russia's drone waves, flies at about 115 miles per hour.

When reports first emerged of the Sting's existence in the fall of 2024, the drone's baseline was to fly faster than 100 miles per hour.

With Monday's video announcement, it has now been recorded notching nearly double that speed.

One of the industry's rising stars, the Sting is being deployed in active combat, though it's unclear at what scale.

The Wild Hornets have said that one interceptor costs $2,500 and that Ukrainian pilots have already used the Sting to destroy roughly 100 Shahed drones.

That's still a small contribution against the total volume of Moscow's drone attacks; Russia launched more than 6,000 Shaheds and decoys in July alone.

But Ukraine hopes interceptor drones will soon shore up the gap in its air defenses. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced a goal for the country to build 1,000 interceptor drones daily.

Kyiv's forces generally report shooting down or disabling between 86 to 89% of Russia's Shaheds, meaning that several hundred still get through a month. The reported interception and disabling rate was 82% in May.

Russia, meanwhile, has been pushing drone technology of its own. It's been reported to be testing and deploying jet-powered versions of the Shahed, which is believed to be modeled after an improved Iranian design that can fly up to 500 miles per hour.

Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has made an unsolicited $34.5 billion bid for Google's Chrome browser, CNBC confirmed on Tuesday.

That figure is higher than Perplexity's current valuation, but the company said several investors have agreed to back the deal. In July, Perplexity was valued at $18 billion as part of an extension that valued the company at $14 billion months earlier.

Google did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. The Wall Street Journal was first to report the bid.

Perplexity is best known for its AI-powered search engine that gives users simple answers to questions and links out to the original source material on the web. Last month, it launched its own AI-powered browser called Comet.

The startup is in the middle of a battle for supremacy in generative AI, with companies including Meta and OpenAI offering massive salaries and signing bonuses to top engineers. Megacap tech companies are spending tens of billions of dollars a year on AI infrastructure to build large language models and run hefty workloads, while startups are raising billions of dollars from venture investors, hedge funds and tech giants to pay for the hardware and headcount needed to compete.

Perplexity was approached by Meta earlier this year about a potential acquisition, but the companies did not finalize a deal.

Perpexity's bid comes after the U.S. Department of Justice proposed Google divest Chrome as part of the antitrust suit the company lost last year. The judge in the case ruled that Google has held an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search.

In response, Google said the DOJ was pushing ""a radical interventionist agenda,"" and that the agency's proposal was ""wildly overbroad."" The company has not yet disclosed how it plans to adjust its business following the antitrust ruling.

Chrome, which Google launched in 2008, provides the search giant with data it then uses for targeting ads. The DOJ said in a filing following the court's decision that forcing the company to get rid of Chrome would create a more equal playing field for search competitors.

""To remedy these harms, the [Initial Proposed Final Judgment] requires Google to divest Chrome, which will permanently stop Google's control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet,"" the DOJ wrote.

Perplexity's bid for Chrome is not the first time it's taken a big swing.

The startup submitted a proposal to merge with the short-form video app TikTok in January. TikTok's future in the U.S. has been uncertain since 2024, when Congress passed a bill that would ban the platform unless its Chinese owner, ByteDance, divested from it.

As of August, Perplexity's proposed structure has not materialized.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to allow a ""major lawsuit"" against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to proceed, escalating his pressure on the central bank leader to cut interest rates.

Trump said in a Truth Social post that the suit would relate to Powell's management of pricey renovations at the Fed's headquarters in Washington, D.C., which the president has previously criticized.

Trump did not say when that suit could be filed or by whom.

""Jerome 'Too Late' Powell must NOW lower the rate,"" Trump wrote in the post.

""Steve 'Manouychin' really gave me a 'beauty'when he pushed this loser,"" Trump wrote, referring to his first-term Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin having encouraged him to nominate Powell as Fed chair in 2017.

""The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable. Fortunately, the economy is sooo good that we've blown through Powell and the complacent Board,"" Trump claimed.

""I am, though, considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed because of the horrible, and grossly incompetent, job he has done in managing the construction of the Fed Buildings.""

""Three Billion Dollars for a job that should have been a $50 Million Dollar fix up. Not good!"" he wrote.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the president's post.

The Fed declined to comment on Trump's post.

Powell and the Fed have previously defended the ongoing renovations of two historic buildings in D.C., which house the central bank, and explained why costs have risen during the projects.

Powell pushed back on Trump to his face last month when the president visited the construction site and claimed that renovation costs had topped $3.1 billion.

""I haven't heard that from anybody,"" Powell said then.

Trump has railed against Powell for months as he pressured the central bank to quickly slash interest rates by multiple percentage points.

Trump claims that doing so would save the United States vast sums of money by reducing the cost of borrowing to finance government operations.

After raising the benchmark federal funds rate in 2022 in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Fed gradually cut interest rates multiple times in 2024, the final full year of President Joe Biden's term in office.

But it has kept rates steady throughout 2025 so far, defying Trump's demands.

In congressional testimony in July, Powell said the Fed would have already cut rates this year if Trump had not implemented his major tariff policy.

Fed officials in June indicated they expect two rate cuts this year.

Traders currently anticipate a quarter-point rate reduction following the Federal Open Market Committee's September meeting. Expectations have risen for further cuts after FOMC meetings in October and December.

Anthropic on Tuesday announced it will offer Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government to all three branches of the U.S. government for $1 per agency for a year.

It's the latest example of how major artificial intelligence companies have been looking to deepen their ties to policymakers and regulators in recent months.

Anthropic's competitor OpenAI announced earlier this month it will give its ChatGPT Enterprise product to U.S. federal agencies for $1 through the next year.

Anthropic said it partnered with the U.S. General Services Administration to bring its technology to participating agencies in the executive, legislative and judicial branches. The company is also offering technical support to help agencies implement its AI.

""America's AI leadership requires that our government institutions have access to the most capable, secure AI tools available,"" Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a statement.

Competition for U.S. government customers has grown fierce.

In June, Anthropic released a set of Claude Gov models that were built exclusively for U.S. national security customers.

The following month, the U.S. Department of Defense announced contract awards of up to $200 million for AI development at Anthropic, Google, OpenAI and Elon Musk's xAI. That same day, xAI announced Grok for Government, which is a suite of products that make the company's models available to U.S. government customers.

OpenAI is planning to open its first office in Washington, D.C., early next year, and it launched a new offering called OpenAI for Government in June.

In this article

Spirit Airlines has warned it might not be able to survive as a going concern if it doesn't raise more cash, five months after the budget travel icon emerged from bankruptcy.

After cutting its debt during restructuring, Spirit has tried to attract bookings by marketing more upscale products and looking for new ways to lower costs. Late last month, the airline announced plans to furlough 270 more pilots this fall.

""However, the Company has continued to be affected by adverse market conditions, including elevated domestic capacity and continued weak demand for domestic leisure travel in the second quarter of 2025, resulting in a challenging pricing environment,"" the company said in its quarterly report late Monday.

As its financial results aren't improving at the same pace creditors agreements require, Spirit will need additional cash. Failing to do so could result in defaults. The carrier is looking at selling some aircraft, real estate or airport gates, it said.

""Because of the uncertainty of successfully completing the initiatives to comply with the minimum liquidity covenants and of the outcome of discussions with Company stakeholders, management has concluded there is substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months from the date these financial statements are issued,"" it said in the filing.

Spirit's bankruptcy last year marked the first for a major U.S. airline since 2011.

Known for its bright yellow planes, Spirit was a budget airline pioneer in the U.S., but struggled in the wake of a failed acquisition by JetBlue Airways last year, shifting consumer tastes to more upmarket products and an engine recall that grounded many of its airplanes.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is not actually interested in negotiating when he meets his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump to discuss the war in Ukraine, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told CNBC on Tuesday.

European officials and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have expressed concerns at being sidelined from the Putin-Trump meeting in Alaska on Friday. The Ukrainian leader warned that Russia is planning further offensives and cannot be trusted, while European leaders have been scrambling to secure Ukraine a seat at the table.

""In order to have any deal implemented, you need Europe and you need Ukraine. So it is clear that Putin is just pretending to negotiate,"" Kallas said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

""Putin doesn't want Zelenskyy around that table, because that would reveal that he actually doesn't want to negotiate, and he just wants to have a picture with President Trump and also postpone sanctions,"" she said. CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for a response to Kallas' claims and is awaiting a response.

European officials and Zelenskyy have been sidelined from the Putin-Trump meeting in Alaska on Friday, which has caused much irritation. Zelenskyy has warned that Russia is planning further offensives and cannot be trusted, while European leaders have been scrambling to try and influence Trump and get Ukraine a seat at the table.

European leaders, including Zelenskyy, are set to meet for a virtual summit later on Tuesday, which will reportedly focus on ways to pressure Russia, the fate of Ukrainian territories seized by Russia and possible security guarantees for Kyiv. Trump has also been invited.

U.S. has threatened, but not yet implemented sanctions on Russia. European officials have long been trying to pressure Washington D.C. to implement measures, which could put pressure on Putin.

Ahead of the talks between Trump and Putin, concerns have also grown that the U.S. president may pursue a solution that would be unfavourable for Ukraine.

Trump suggested on Monday that there could ""some swapping"" of territory as part of a peace deal though he insisted the U.S. ""would try to get some of that territory back for Ukraine.""

The EU's Kallas on Tuesday said no deal could be implemented behind Ukraine's back. When asked about how the EU could react should Trump agree to cede some Ukrainian territory to Russia, she said: ""How would that work in practice, like really, if Ukraine doesn't agree to this, then how would it really work?""

Putin clearly just wants concessions, she said, adding that before any talks about ceding territory, a ceasefire should be discussed.

""Just to recall that Ukraine agreed to unconditional ceasefire already five months ago, and since then, Putin and Kremlin, Russia has just been playing games,"" Kallas said.

""Russia could stop this war today. Just stop bombing the civilians and civilian infrastructure, and the war would be over,"" she added.

The EU diplomat also addressed tensions within the bloc regarding its approach to the war.

Hungary, which has previously created hurdles for the approval of EU sanctions against Russia, this week chose not to endorse a statement by the bloc that said Ukraine must be free to decide its own future.

""We definitely also need to discuss our working methods, because this is a crucial time for Europe, it is a crucial time for our security, and we need to be able to adopt decisions. We have been able to adopt decisions so far, but it's of course, increasingly more difficult,"" Kallas said.

In this article

On sales rose 32% in the Swiss sportswear company's second quarter, leading it to raise its full-year revenue guidance even as it contends with new tariffs on imports from Vietnam. 

The buzzy sneaker brand, which has been credited with taking market share from Nike, now expects full-year sales of 2.91 billion Swiss francs ($3.58 billion), up from its previous outlook of 2.86 billion francs. That's in line with Wall Street expectations of 2.92 billion francs, according to LSEG. 

On also raised its gross margin guidance to a range of 60.5% to 61%, compared with its previous outlook of between 60% and 60.5%. 

The company's shares jumped 7% in morning trading Tuesday.

On, which sources about 90% of its goods from Vietnam, raised prices on July 1 to offset the higher costs. It hasn't seen demand slow down among wholesale partners or consumers, CEO Martin Hoffmann told CNBC in an interview. 

""We have a lot of confidence in our lifestyle business, so we skewed the price increases more towards the lifestyle business, while trying to stay a bit more where we were on our running products,"" Hoffmann said. ""So far, we don't see negative impact from the price increases."" 

The company, which has grown more than 30% in nearly every quarter since 2023, beat Wall Street's sales expectations for the second quarter. 

Here's how On did in its second quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

On's net loss in the three months ended June 30 was 40.9 million francs or 12 cents per share, compared with net income of 30.8 million francs, or 10 cents per share, in the year-ago period. The loss was primarily driven by foreign exchange fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc.

Sales rose to 749 million francs, up 32% from 568 million francs a year earlier.

On, founded in Switzerland in 2010, has sought to become the most premium sportswear brand on the market. It is one of several companies that have been taking share from Nike, most notably in its running segment. The company draws a fraction of Nike's annual sales, but it has garnered a reputation for innovation, a recent knock against the legacy sneaker giant. 

In a sneaker category that's been relatively soft in recent years, On has consistently grown sales in the mid-double digits and still has more room to grow given how low its brand awareness is in some parts of the world. 

One key to the strategy has been balancing direct sales through its own website and stores and sales through wholesale. At a time when Nike pulled away from wholesalers, On and others filled that crucial shelf space while growing their store footprint and digital revenue. 

During the second quarter, On's wholesale and direct-to-consumer revenue both exceeded Wall Street expectations. On's wholesale revenue was 441 million francs, compared with estimates of 429 million francs, according to StreetAccount. Direct sales were 308 million francs, compared with expectations of 279 million francs, according to StreetAccount. 

Sales in the Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and the Asia-Pacific region all beat expectations, according to StreetAccount. 

While On doesn't break out its performance in China, Hoffmann said it's been a bright spot for the company, as sales grew about 50% in the second quarter compared with the year-ago period. 

""The American and the Chinese consumer is very strong for On,"" said Hoffmann. ""We have seen basically 50% same-store growth in our retail stores, even bigger growth in our [e-commerce] channel, and then the new stores come on top so … China is a very strong market for us.""

In this article

U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled that he'd be open to allowing Nvidia to sell a downgraded version of its most advanced artificial intelligence chip to China.

Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Trump said that he could make a deal with Nvidia if it could reduce the performance of its Blackwell system.

""It's possible I'd make a deal"" on a ""somewhat enhanced — in a negative way — Blackwell"" processor, Trump said. ""In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it.""

Trump indicated that he will meet with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang regarding the Blackwell.

""On the Blackwell, I think he [Huang] is coming to see me again about that,"" Trump said, adding that the Blackwell system is the ""latest and the greatest in the world.""

Last month, Huang, who has lobbied Trump for access to the Chinese market after effectively being shut out, said he hopes to sell more advanced chips to China.

The flurry of activity around semiconductors comes after Nvidia and AMD agreed to a deal to pay the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. Trump said he initially asked for a 20% cut but that the number came down to 15% after Huang negotiated.

If the downgraded Blackwell chips were approved for export, it ""would be a big deal going forward,"" said Paul Triolo, partner and senior vice president for China at advisory firm DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group.

""The idea here is to addict China to substandard, or non-cutting edge technology, Triolo added.

Nvidia's Huang has often touted the idea that if China is cut off from American chips then domestic tech firms like Huawei will fill the void. He has argued that U.S. chips should be sold in China so that Chinese firms are dependent on them when developing their AI technology.

Washington's chip export regime has evolved over the past few years. Nvidia was blocked in 2022 from exporting its A100 and H100 chips to China — chips that are crucial for training large AI models. In 2023, the U.S. placed additional export curbs on more Nvidia semiconductors.

Chinese firms stockpiled these chips and have been using them to build their AI models. These chips were acquired legally and are still being used to train models, according to Triolo.

It's not yet clear what kind of capabilities a downgraded Blackwell system for China would have and if it would be suitable for training more advanced models. In the meantime, Huawei is continuing to develop its Ascend series of processors, which it is trying to position as an Nvidia alternative.

""We are in sort of a transition point of running out of those stockpiles of earlier acquired Nvidia GPUs and hoping that Huawei's new Ascend series of processors will be capable of replacing those but they are not quite capable of doing that yet,"" Triolo said.

""Probably next year Huawei will have a new version of its 910 processors that will be more competitive with Nvidia.""

Sidelined from forthcoming talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end to the war, Ukraine has warned the world that Moscow is not to be trusted and is planning new offensives.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said intelligence and military officials had briefed him on Monday ""on what Putin is counting on and what he is actually preparing for,"" saying ""this includes military preparations.""

""He is certainly not preparing to cease fire or end the war,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly address.

""There is not a single sign that the Russians have been told to prepare for a post-war situation – not yet. On the contrary, they are moving their troops and forces in ways that indicate they plan to launch new offensive operations. No one preparing for peace acts this way,"" he added.

""Putin's sole aim is to present a meeting with America as his personal victory and then continue acting as before, putting pressure on Ukraine as before,"" the president warned. CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for a response to Zelenskyy's claims and is awaiting a response.

The problem for Ukraine is whether anyone is listening.

Neither Zelenskyy nor European officials are invited to the Trump-Putin talks in Alaska on Friday, much to their consternation.

Ukraine has vehemently stated that no deal about its future can be struck in its absence, amid fears that it could be forced to cede Russian-occupied territory to Moscow as part of a peace deal. European leaders, meanwhile, are pushing strongly for Ukraine's involvement in the talks. The U.S., for its part, has said it is considering inviting Zelenskyy, NBC News reported.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz invited Trump to join Zelenskyy and European leaders when they hold an emergency call on Tuesday afternoon in anticipation of Friday's talks. The virtual summit will reportedly focus on ways to pressure Russia, the fate of Ukrainian territories seized by Russia and possible security guarantees for Kyiv.

Kaja Kallas, the European Union's foreign policy chief, told CNBC Tuesday that Putin was ""just pretending to negotiate"" and was trying to circumvent Trump's threat of further sanctions if a ceasefire is not agreed.

""In order to have any deal implemented, you need Europe and you need Ukraine. So it is clear that Putin is just pretending to negotiate. Otherwise it would have Ukraine around that table. He just wants to postpone the sanctions, and that's why he's playing this game,"" Kallas told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

Claiming that Putin ""just wants to have a picture with President Trump,"" Kallas said Russia had shown little appetite for peace.

""It is clear that Putin just wants some concessions, and they haven't done any concessions on their side before [talking about ceding] territories, we should talk about ceasefire ... Ukraine agreed to an unconditional ceasefire already five months ago, and since then, Putin and the Kremlin have just been playing games. So we should really put the pressure on Russia,"" she said.

Trump suggested on Monday that there could ""some swapping"" of territory as part of a peace deal though he insisted the U.S. ""would try to get some of that territory back for Ukraine.""

""There'll be some swapping, there'll be some changes in land,"" Trump told reporters at the White House, although he downplayed any expectations of what could come of the talks, describing them as a ""feel-out meeting.""

""We're going to see what he has in mind and if it's a fair deal, I'll reveal it to the European Union leaders and to NATO leaders and also to President Zelensky,"" Trump said.

Geopolitical analysts agree that the talks are unlikely to yield a comprehensive and long-lasting solution to the more-than-three year conflict between Russia and Ukraine, given the complexity of the war, its underlying causes and the number of stakeholders involved.

Instead, the talks ""should be seen as the Trump administration's attempt to assess whether there is space for a mutually acceptable compromise — at least on select issues,"" Andrius Tursa, Central and Eastern Europe advisor at risk consultancy Teneo, said in emailed comments Monday.

""Even in a best-case scenario, any high-level agreement would require multiple rounds of difficult follow-up talks to resolve implementation issues. This would be another option for Moscow to draw out the talks, hoping to capitalize on its gradually increasing advantage on the frontlines,"" he noted.

The Kremlin may seek to exploit growing exhaustion in Ukraine by proposing a temporary or partial de-escalation in the war, Tursa said.

""Such a move would offer the Trump administration a symbolic diplomatic success while placing pressure on Kyiv to make substantial concessions. Should Ukraine fail to respond in a way deemed acceptable by Moscow, the Kremlin would likely portray Kyiv as the main obstacle to peace and count on Washington to increase pressure on Zelenskyy.""

Tursa said this latter scenario underscores the risks inherent in any potential Trump-Putin agreement that's reached without the direct involvement of Ukraine and its European allies.

""Despite Ukraine's reliance on U.S. support, neither Zelensky nor Ukraine's parliament could be expected to endorse an agreement perceived as unfavorable and lacking public backing. Zelensky's administration has already publicly rejected the idea of territorial concessions floated ahead of the summit, clearly signaling Kyiv's red lines.""

The heaviest of U.S. President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs — a full 145% on imports of Chinese goods — was, once again, delayed for another 90 days.

The move should be a huge relief not just to investors, but perhaps most of the population on Earth. The U.S. and China are the two largest economies in the world, according to World Bank data, and a trade war in which imports of each other's goods double in price would probably stymie, if not cripple, the global economy.

But markets were mostly unmoved. Well, they did move — lower. The three big U.S. stock indexes retreated Monday as this outcome was more or less expected, since both sides had earlier telegraphed an extension of the tariff pause.

Investors could have also been conditioned to expect flip-flopping from Trump, such that threats, promises, criticisms and praises don't carry as much heft as they should anymore. On Monday, Trump said Intel's CEO Lip-Bu Tan's ""success and rise is an amazing story,"" after describing Tan as ""highly CONFLICTED"" the week before.

There's a Freudian idea in which an individual projects their thoughts and feelings to another person. Researchers are, well, conflicted, on the veracity of the phenomenon, but empirical observation suggests it's not uncommon.

Trump extends pause on China tariffs. U.S. tariffs on China were delayed for 90 days, Trump said on Truth Social. It was the expected outcome from the latest round of talks between the two countries.

Elon Musk threatens legal action against Apple. Musk alleged that Apple is engaging in antitrust violations by making it ""impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store."" Musk is the founder of xAI, which is behind the Grok AI chatbot.

Intel CEO is a ""success,"" Trump says. The U.S. president's praise of Lip-Bu Tan is a reversal in tone from his previous week's message, in which Trump said Tan ""must resign, immediately.""

U.S. stocks end Monday lower. Major stock indexes fell as traders awaited inflation data. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 touched record highs Tuesday, with the latter boosted by the Reserve Bank of Australia's rate cut.

[PRO] Europe's defense sector could receive another leg up. According to Ben Heelan, Bank of America's head of EU industrials research, one corner of the investing world, previously reluctant to turn to defense stocks, might be changing its mind.

Spain treads a risky path by standing up to Trump on defense and China

The Spanish government recently renounced U.S. aircraft purchases and resisted intense pressure to commit to NATO's new 5% defense spending target, while seeking closer economic ties with China.

Taken together, analysts say Spain has become a rare example of a European country willing to draw the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump. Notably, despite Trump threatening a tough trade deal for Spain, the European country has not faced any material consequences.

Spain's somewhat unique approach to defense and foreign policy is fueling tensions with the Trump administration.

The Spanish government recently renounced U.S. aircraft purchases and resisted intense pressure to commit to NATO's new 5% defense spending target, while seeking closer economic ties with China.

Taken together, analysts say Spain has become a rare example of a European country willing to draw the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Notably, despite Trump threatening a tough trade deal for Spain, the southern European country has not yet faced any material consequences.

""Spain is an interesting case in Europe because it is really the only country that is openly antagonizing Trump whereas everybody is trying to keep their head down for the most part,"" Federico Santi, a senior analyst focused on southern Europe at Eurasia Group, told CNBC by video call.

What's particular to Spain, Santi said, was the ""distinct weakness"" of the country's minority leftist coalition government, which has been embroiled in a series of scandals and corruption investigations.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who has led the country since 2018, has rebuffed calls from opposition lawmakers to resign. The leader of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party has instead said he intends to run for re-election in 2027.

The opportunity to focus on big-ticket foreign policy issues such as defense, Eurasia Group's Santi said, could help Sanchez to distract the public from his own domestic woes.

""Spain has, by and large, gotten away with its fairly outspoken criticism of Trump for two main reasons. Number one, it is in the EU. So, unlike the South Africa's or Brazil's of the world that faced a very direct backlash from Trump in the form of higher tariffs, they are somewhat shielded from that,"" Santi said.

""And the other point I think that works to Sanchez's advantage is that Trump just doesn't seem to be that concerned or aware of Spain as a country. I mean, he's aware of it, but it is not really on his radar,"" he added.

A spokesperson for Spain's government did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.

Spain's defense ministry said last week that it was no longer considering the option of buying U.S.-made F-35s, Reuters reported, preferring instead to replace its ageing fighter jet fleet with European military aircraft.

The decision to snub Lockheed Martin's fighter jets came after Trump said it was ""terrible"" that Madrid wouldn't commit to the NATO defense spending target of 5% of gross domestic product by 2035.

Speaking at a news conference at NATO's annual summit in the Netherlands in late June, Trump said the Spanish economy ""could be blown right out of the water with something bad happening.""

The U.S. president also threatened to make Spain pay ""twice as much"" on trade, criticizing Madrid for wanting to take ""a little bit of a free ride"" on defense.

The U.S. and EU, however, have since signed a framework trade agreement that means the 27-nation bloc will face tariffs of 15% on EU goods to the U.S. The EU negotiates trade deals collectively, which means Spain benefits from the collective bargain struck by Brussels.

In stark contrast, Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU, has been hit hard by a U.S. tariff rate of 39% on key export products.

Ignacio Molina, senior fellow at the Elcano Royal Institute, a think tank in Madrid, said Spain's geographic distance from Russia and the distinct features of its foreign policy stretching back to its last war in 1898, which was against the U.S., means that Madrid views its relationship with Washington as ""less vital"" than other EU countries.

""The dominant political culture in Spain is much more pro-European than Atlanticist. Even with regard to Ukraine (whom Spain strongly supports) Spain's main focus is on its EU accession bid and the reception of refugees, not on its NATO membership or arms deliveries,"" Molina told CNBC by email.

Molina highlighted that Spain-U.S. relations are further complicated by the fact that the Spanish government is the ""most ideologically left-leaning"" in all of Europe.

""This introduces a domestic political temptation to distance itself from Trump, who is extremely unpopular in Spain, including among center-right voters,"" Molina said.

A diplomatic rift between Spain and the U.S. has also been exacerbated by Madrid's pursuit of closer economic ties with Beijing.

The U.S. has two military bases in southern Spain, a country that has emerged as one of Europe's most China-friendly governments.

Both U.S. and EU officials have recently been critical of Sanchez's decision to award a multi-million-euro contract to Chinese tech giant Huawei for the use of its wiretapping technology.

Kristina Kausch, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the U.S., and the think tank's representative in Madrid, said Spain's deepening ties with China had raised eyebrows in the U.S. and parts of Europe.

""While this echoes a broader desire in Europe for strategic rebalancing, EU leaders have stressed that such a rebalancing must be based in reciprocity,"" Kausch said.

By resisting U.S. purchasing pressure on defense, Kausch told CNBC that Spain has demonstrated Europe's determination to independently develop military capabilities and industrial capacity.

Even with the cover of EU membership, however, Kausch said the approach is not likely to be risk-free.

""Spain is giving a voice to concerns that are also shared, to greater or lesser degree, by other EU or NATO allies. It shows leadership, but it is also a big gamble that could backfire on Sanchez personally, on Spain, and on Europe,"" she added.

In this article

Tesla is recruiting test drivers in New York to operate cars with ""automated driving systems,"" but the company hasn't applied for the permits it would need to test autonomous vehicles in the nation's largest city.

A job opening on Tesla's website says the company is looking to hire vehicle operators in the borough of Queens. The hires will be ""responsible for driving an engineering vehicle for extended periods, conducting dynamic audio and camera data collection for testing and training purposes.""

A spokesperson for the New York City Department of Transportation told CNBC on Monday that Tesla has not applied for approvals to test AVs on city streets in New York. InsideEVs, an electric vehicles news site, previously reported that Tesla was hiring test drivers for its robotaxis in Brooklyn.

Any company that obtains a permit to test AVs in New York has to keep ""a trained safety driver behind the wheel, ready to take control of an AV-enabled vehicle at all times,"" according to the DOT spokesperson.

Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.

Alphabet's Waymo, the robotaxi leader in North America, has applied to test its AVs in New York, but its application remains under review, the DOT said Monday.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been trying to sell investors on a future for his company that's built around AI and robotics, rather than sales of its existing vehicles. But Tesla still earns almost all of its revenue from sales of EVs and battery energy storage systems.

Tesla's EV sales have been on the decline this year, especially in Europe, partly due to Musk's decision to focus on the Cybertruck, rather than producing a more affordable EV with mainstream appeal. Some of the company's struggles are the result of a political backlash against Tesla because of Musk's incendiary political rhetoric, work with President Donald Trump, and endorsements of Germany's anti-immigrant AfD party.

Along with its recruiting efforts in Queens, Tesla is also seeking to hire test drivers for its Autopilot team to gather data from drives in cities and suburbs of Dallas, Houston, Tampa, Orlando and Miami, as well as Palo Alto, California, home to Tesla's engineering headquarters.

The current listings on Tesla's website say Autopilot vehicle operators may need to travel to international and domestic destinations and must be familiar with ""automated driving systems,"" suggesting planned or ongoing testing of Tesla's robotaxi and FSD or Full Self Driving system, currently marketed as FSD Unsupervised in the U.S.

Tesla notched a win in Texas last week, obtaining a permit to run a ride-hailing service in the state. The Tesla Robotaxi LLC permit and state regulations do not require Tesla to keep a human safety driver on board.

However, Tesla has been operating a fleet of robotaxis in Austin since late June, with employees riding in the front passenger seat, tasked with manually intervening during a trip if necessary. The service has only been accessible to invited users. Musk said in a post on X over the weekend that he intends for the Austin service to open to the general public next month.

In San Francisco, Tesla is also operating a limited, manned car service but promoting it as ""autonomous ride-hailing."" 

Musk posted last week that the company is ""working as quickly as possible to get 100+ Teslas operating for autonomous ride-hailing (can't use the word ""taxi"" or ""cab"" in California) in the Bay Area and allow anyone to request a ride.""

The company is not authorized to carry passengers on public roads in autonomous vehicles in California, the California Public Utilities Commission told CNBC in a recent email.

Tesla's approach to AVs has drawn federal probes, product liability lawsuits and recalls following injurious or damaging collisions that occurred while drivers were using the company's Autopilot or FSD systems.

The California DMV previously sued Tesla, accusing it of false advertising around its driver assistance systems.

While Tesla owners manuals say the Autopilot and FSD features in their cars are ""hands on"" systems that require a driver ready to steer or brake at any time, Tesla and Musk have shared statements through the years saying that a Tesla can ""drive itself.""

Markets are on high alert ahead of US inflation data set to be released on Tuesday, which could set the stage for crypto's next rally.

That's according to Alice Liu, head of research at CoinMarketCap, who said that the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, could “lock in expectations for a September Fed rate cut, which is generally bullish risk-on assets like crypto.”

Low rates usually incentivises investors to tap into riskier bets like digital assets.

The CPI figures “could potentially trigger Bitcoin's next all-time high,” Liu said in comments shared with DL News. 

The new data comes as Bitcoin trades around $118,500 after surging past $122,000 over the weekend, reversing last week's losses, with Ethereum gaining over 20% in the same period. 

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes the CPI figures every month. It is a key economic metric closely followed by policymakers, businesses, and markets, and is seen as one of the most important macro events this month for both Wall Street and digital assets. 

A lower CPI figure could solidify expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September while a hotter inflation read may hit Fed rate cut chances and weigh on crypto markets.

The new numbers are “poised to be one of the most critical macro data releases in recent memory for risk assets,” analysts at Presto Labs wrote in a Tuesday note to investors.

Several analysts have said they anticipate that crypto prices will soon hit record highs. 

Bitwise, Bernstein and Standard Chartered have all predicted that Bitcoin's price will hit $200,000 before the end of the year. 

Even so, Liu notes that Bitcoin and Ethereum options trades have surged to “near yearly highs” of $43 billion and $14 billion respectively. 

“This high open interest from derivatives traders could amplify volatility, so be cautious of short squeezes, sudden liquidations, or sharp price moves,” Liu said.

The Fed has held its benchmark rate at 4.25%–4.50% all year. Markets are pricing an 84.4% chance of a September cut, according to the CME FedWatch tool. That's up from the beginning of August when traders put the chances at 40%.

Bitcoin Depot reported a second-quarter profit of $12.3 million on Tuesday, attributing the 183% increase compared to a year ago partly to an increase in the value of its Bitcoin holdings.

The Atlanta-based firm, which operates over 8,800 crypto kiosks across North America, said the value of its Bitcoin holdings increased $2.3 million in the second quarter. As of June 30, the company held 100 BTC worth $11.5 million, a 666% increase compared to a year ago.

Revenue rose 6% year-over-year to $172 million, as a result of increased kiosk deployment and a higher median transaction size among customers exchanging cash for Bitcoin, the firm said.

Bitcoin Depot's stock price fell 14.4% on Tuesday to $4.14, according to Yahoo Finance. The company's shares have still popped 155% year-to-date.

On an earnings broadcast, Bitcoin Depot CEO Brandon Mintz said that 3,300, or nearly a third of the company's active machines, had been installed for less than a year. He later noted that the company has 1,700 kiosks in inventory that could later be deployed.

The company raised $12 million in the second quarter through an at-the-money offering program, selling common shares in a similar way to Bitcoin-buying firm Strategy. CFO David Gray signaled that the Bitcoin ATM operator could use funds raised to accumulate Bitcoin—it bought 6 BTC in Q2—pay down debt, or pursue strategic mergers and acquisitions.

With several Bitcoin ATM operators across the U.S., Mintz said that the firm is trying to “consolidate a fragmented market,” acquiring the assets of Telecoin, a Louisiana-based Bitcoin ATM operator in the second quarter.

The company has relocated the position of its kiosks in light of regulatory shifts, such as a law passed last year in California that imposed limits on daily transactions and the spread that Bitcoin Depot charges. Mintz said the company has around 200 kiosks left in the region.

At the same time, the company is also expanding overseas, deploying 200 kiosks in Australia this year, which “continues to emerge as a global hot spot for Bitcoin adoption, Mintz said.

Bitcoin was recently trading at about $119,700, down slightly over the past 24 hours but up 6% during the last week.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) stock popped as much as 5% at the opening bell on Tuesday after ethereum (ETH-USD) rose another 5% to trade north of $4,400 and the company announced plans to sell up to another $20 billion worth of stock to increase its holdings of the cryptocurrency.

Bitmine, whose board is led by investor Tom Lee, announced Monday that its holdings of ETH stood at $4.96 billion, or a little over 1.15 million tokens, meaning the company owns roughly 1% of all tokens in circulation.

The company's goal is to eventually acquire 5% of the world's outstanding ETH tokens. Monday's news pushed the stock up more than 14%. The stock is up over 600% this year.

""We are leading crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of our stock,"" Tom Lee said in a press release announcing the company's latest ethereum purchase.

Bitmine is one of a host of cryptocurrency ""treasury companies,"" a strategy most prolifically pioneered by Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), which holds large amounts of bitcoin on its balance sheet.

In plain terms, the companies pursuing the strategy issue stock and use the proceeds from the issuance to buy cryptocurrencies that are held on their balance sheet.

Another major ETH market holder alongside Bitmine, cryptocurrency broker Coinbase (COIN), saw shares up more than 2% in premarket trading on Tuesday. Coinbase operates one of the largest transaction-processing chains on ethereum and holds on its balance sheet more than 100,000 tokens, valued at more than $500 million, according to trade publication Coindesk.

The crypto treasury strategy has attracted a variety of companies, including perennial meme stock GameStop (GME), which announced in March its intent to hold bitcoin on its balance sheet, and ETH treasury holder SharpLink Gaming (SBET).

Ether has soared over the past month, trading up more than 50% to a value of more than $4,400 per token. The cryptocurrency has yet to crest its high-water mark of more than $4,600, which it attained in October 2021.

Bitcoin, comparatively, is up a bit over 1% over the past month.

Ether received a boon in June with the highly successful IPO of fintech giant Circle Internet Group (CRCL), which offers the stablecoin USD Coin. The ethereum network has also gained widespread recognition as the ecosystem of choice for most stablecoin mintings, according to Coindesk.

BitMine Immersion shares surged after the company revealed plans to raise up to $20 billion to expand its $5 billion Ethereum stash. It is aiming to control 5% of the token's supply.

BitMine Immersion Technology (BMNR) shares surged in pre-market trading after the crypto treasury firm announced plans to raise as much as $20 billion to buy more Ethereum (ETH-USD). The move could make it one of the largest holders of the world's second-biggest cryptocurrency.





The company, led by Fundstrat co-founder Thomas Lee, already holds nearly $5 billion in ETH as of Aug. 10. Its long-term goal is to acquire 5% of the entire ETH supply, a stash worth roughly $25 billion at today's prices.

BitMine has wasted little time in scaling up its treasury strategy. The firm previously authorized $4.5 billion in stock sales through deals with Cantor Fitzgerald and ThinkEquity, nearly exhausting that allocation. Now it is dramatically increasing its ambitions with the new $20 billion target.

The plan involves continuing to sell shares into a market that has been showing strong appetite for BMNR stock. High trading volumes, averaging $2.2 billion daily last week, mean the company can raise capital with less downward pressure on its share price. BMNR ranked as the 25th most traded U.S.-listed stock last week, surpassing heavyweights such as JPMorgan (JPM) and Micron (MU).

BitMine's aggressive buying spree is designed to accumulate and stake ETH, earning yield while competing with other digital asset treasury plays such as SharpLink Gaming (SBET). Its rivals are watching closely since the scale of this buying program could move markets if executed in full.

Chairman Tom Lee says BitMine is “leading crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV [net asset value] per share and by the high trading liquidity of our stock.” He sees both as critical advantages as the firm pushes toward its 5% ETH ownership goal.

The announcement helped extend BitMine's recent rally. BMNR shares were up over 10% in Tuesday's pre-market trading, building on Friday's near 25% gain. That buying momentum has coincided with ether hitting new cycle highs above $4,300 over the weekend, aided by aggressive accumulation from digital asset treasuries like BitMine.

If the $20 billion program is completed, BitMine would strengthen its position as one of the most influential players in ETH markets. This is a bet that could pay off handsomely if Ethereum's price continues to climb in the next bull cycle. However, with such a massive move, the gamble also comes with much more risk if crypto markets turn against them.

Based on TipRanks data, ThinkEquity analyst Ashok Kumar initiated coverage on BitMine Immersion Technologies with a Buy rating and a $60 price target. This target implies a potential upside of about 3.48% from the company's most recent close at $57.98.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum ETFs and strategic reserves now account for 7.98% of ETH's total supply, according to data from Strategic ETH Reserve.xyz.

This percentage has risen from about 3% as recently as the beginning of April, when no publicly listed company held any Ethereum as a reserve asset.

Since then a wave of corporations have added ETH to their treasuries, helping the altcoin to rise from $1,800 in early April to its current price of $4,300.

This includes firms such as Bitmine Immersion Tech, The Ether Machine and  SharpLink Gaming, which respectively own 1.2 million ETH, 598,800 ETH and 345,400 ETH.

At the same time, Ethereum ETFs have gone from holding 3.5 million ETH to 6.15 million ETH, an amount which on its own equals over 5% of the alt's total circulating supply.

The two biggest Ethereum ETFs are currently BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust ETF, with $13.1 billion in net assets, and Fidelity's Ethereum Fund, with $3 billion.

The total value of all Ethereum funds now stands at $31.9 billion according to the latest CoinShares report, which represents 17.8% of the value of all Bitcoin funds, at $179.3 billion.

The total AUM of ETH funds has risen from $14.6 billion as recently as June 30, meaning that these funds have more than doubled within a month.

For some experts, this rapid rate of growth stems largely from Ethereum's immaturity in relation to Bitcoin, for which total funds have seen an increase in AUM of only 12.5% since the end of June.

""What's happening now feels familiar: many who missed the Bitcoin treasury moment are jumping on Ethereum and other altcoins, hoping for the same impact,” says Melanion Capital CEO Jad Comair, speaking to Decrypt.

Other analysts and industry participants agree with this kind of take, with YouHodler Chief of Markets Ruslan Lienkha telling Decrypt that Ethereum had “lagged in performance” prior to its recent gains, and that it's still trailing on its 2021 ATH of $4,878.

SharpLink Stock Rises, Then Falls Following $400M Deal to Boost Ethereum Treasury

He explained that Ethereum's ""relative underperformance"" creates an ""appealing risk-reward profile: if macroeconomic and market conditions remain favorable, ETH could deliver outsized gains over a shorter time frame compared to Bitcoin.”

Yet it's not only starting from a relatively low base that has helped make Ethereum attractive to institutions and public companies, but also its status as the biggest layer-one network in crypto.

“Ethereum's robust ecosystem offers diversified utility beyond being a store of value, further enhancing its investment appeal for institutions and public companies seeking both growth potential and technological exposure,” Lienkha added.

Not everyone is convinced that Ethereum ETFs will maintain its recent levels of activity, however, with Comair likening the recent growth in ETFs and strategic ETH reserves to the 2017-18 “ICO boom.”

“But ETH doesn't command the same potential or level of corporate interest, and we'll probably see Solana or others branded as ‘treasury coins' next,' he argues.

Comair, whose company offers a Bitcoin Equities ETF, also suggests that Bitcoin treasuries are “fundamentally creating value” for corporate finances, whereas “most” altcoin treasury moves are “likely to be a passing fad.”

Bitcoin ETFs Bounce Back—But Ethereum Funds Are on Top

Yet Lienkha contends that market conditions currently remain “constructive,” in terms of major indices trading near or at all-time highs, and that the trend of growing Ethereum ETFs and treasuries will continue.

“This risk-on environment is likely to stimulate further capital inflows into ETH, particularly as institutions continue to diversify their digital asset exposure beyond Bitcoin and recognize Ethereum's broader utility within the blockchain ecosystem,” he says.

Solana meme coins are one of the worst-performing crypto asset classes of the day, according to CoinGecko, with the category as a whole slumping by 8.5%. It comes as experts say that investors are rotating funds into “quality-focused” assets such as Ethereum and other leading altcoins.

Major Solana meme coins, such as absurdist meme Chill House, the lowbrow token Fartcoin, and gaming-inspired meme MLG, have all dropped by double digits on the day. The network's second-largest meme coin BONK has fallen 6.5%, despite the announcement that a publicly traded company intends to acquire $115 million worth of the token by the end of the year.

It's worth noting that the total meme coin sector is down 4.1% on the day and the entire crypto market is trading flat, per CoinGecko, but Solana memes have underperformed the wider meme coin market. Meanwhile, it's been a great month for Ethereum, up 4.7% on the day per CoinGecko data.

“The ETH ecosystem, DeFi, and higher-beta L1s have generally held up better than meme-coins. SOL continues to lag, with competitors questioning its narrative,” Max Shannon, senior associate at crypto index provider Bitwise, told Decrypt.

It follows a spike in institutional interest in ETH, as $10.87 billion in total has flowed into Ethereum ETFs while public treasury companies have acquired more than $14 billion. Ethereum ETFs and strategic reserves now account for almost 8% of ETH's total supply.

“Our institutional clients are becoming increasingly fundamental-discerning and quality-focused,” Shannon explained. “The emerging narrative is ETH as the backbone for institutional capital moving on-chain: Ethereum combines a long operating history, zero downtime, and leading decentralization and liquidity.”

As such, the best performing assets on the day are projects like the purpose-built real-world asset network Provenance Blockchain, which has jumped 10.2%. Over the week, other “quality-focused” projects have seen the largest gains, like the stablecoin issuer Ethena, which spiked 40.5 in the past seven days%.

“Solana meme coins are down and marking one of the sharpest sector declines, while higher-liquidity altcoins are drawing flows,” Jamie Elkaleh, Chief Marketing Officer at Bitget Wallet, told Decrypt.

Elkaleh added that the pattern “points to a clear capital shift: traders are trimming exposure to the highest-beta, thin-liquidity bets and reallocating into deeper markets with stronger narratives and institutional participation, especially ahead of macro events like the U.S. CPI print.”

That said, volume in the Solana trenches saw a steady increase over the past seven days, according to Dune data, spiking to $235 million in daily volume across token launchpads on Monday. The increase has occurred amid a battle for market share between token launchpads, with Pump.fun reclaiming its crown on Wednesday.

Still, per CoinGecko, Solana is down just 0.5% on the day as the third-worst-performing asset in the top 10 cryptocurrencies—behind XRP, which set a new all-time high last month, and Dogecoin.

“Although memecoins remain the most actively traded assets on Solana DEXs, their share has recently dropped to 44% from a mid-July peak of 73%,” Illia Otychenko, Lead Analyst at crypto exchange CEX.IO, told Decrypt. “This indicates waning interest even within the Solana ecosystem, which could be the catalyst behind their contraction.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Best Altcoins as Trump Media Bitcoin ETF Joins Crypto.com","https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-alongside-truth-social-btc-etf/","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 10:26:36 GMT","

Trump Media (parent company of Truth Social) has updated its Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing for the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF.

If approved, the ETF would give investors direct exposure to $BTC's price through publicly traded shares.

Historically, Bitcoin ETF approvals spark demand for $BTC itself. And as the crypto leader, its success often fuels rallies for other coins as investors look to diversify their portfolios for broader gains.

As hype builds, now could be a prime time to scoop up some of the best altcoins before their prices soar.

If all goes as planned, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF would enter an extremely competitive space dominated by heavyweights like BlackRock's IBIT, Fidelity's FBTC, Bitwise's BITB, and Ark Investment's ARK.

To put their weight into perspective, IBIT alone has attracted $57.9B in total inflows, followed by FBTC with $12.05B.

The Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, however, has a competitive edge. Because it attaches the Truth Social brand to a regulated $BTC investment product, it brings together political influence, media reach, and crypto hype that's tricky to replicate.

Also, Crypto.com is the world's third-largest exchange by trading volume. As such, its operational role adds credibility and scale to the fund, possibly attracting investors seeking a secure, well-managed Bitcoin ETF.

This kind of high-profile Bitcoin ETF launch is bound to have a knock-on effect on the next crypto to explode. Especially altcoins tied to strong use cases, like Best Wallet Token ($BEST), T-RIZE ($RIZE), and Snorter Token ($SNORT).

As the crypto industry continues attracting attention, significantly propelled by Donald Trump's Web3 advocacy, this could be your best chance yet to join the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale.

As crypto adoption accelerates, the mobile app (available on iOS and Android) is a go-to hub for buying, managing, and swapping over 1K+ digital assets – all while having complete control over your private keys.

In fact, its ‘Cross-Chain Swaps' feature promises to give you the best rates and lowest fees, thanks to its integration with 330 decentralized exchanges and 30 bridges.

The wallet currently supports major chains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon. However, it'll soon expand across 60 networks, so you can access diverse DeFi opportunities and enjoy even faster, cheaper transactions in one place.

All is achieved without compromising security. It utilizes Fireblocks' MPC security technology, enabling you to secure cloud backups of all your multi-chain wallets. Doing so ensures easy account recovery and protection against hacks or single points of failure.

And the excitement doesn't end there. Best Wallet has tons to look forward to in the pipeline, including the debuts of its very own crypto debit card (Best Card), NFT gallery, and market intel analytics.

For the full suite of perks, however, you'll want to snag some $BEST. Then, you can enjoy staking rewards at a 92% APY, governance rights, lower gas fees, and exclusive access to the best crypto presales.

$BEST is available on presale for just $0.025475. If it continues to roll out the developments promised on its roadmap, plus if Trump keeps advocating for crypto, it could reach $0.62 next year.

When taking into account that the upside here could surpass 2,333%, now's a great time to join $BEST at its lowest current price tag.

$RIZE is the linchpin of T-RIZE, a decentralized platform that makes it easy and compliant to tokenize and trade real-world assets (RWAs).

By allowing RWAS owners to bring their projects on-chain – like real estate, infrastructure, and private equity – the platform allows you to buy fractional ownership. This way, you can invest in high-value assets at a fraction of the price, all while benefiting from the blockchain's transparency.

T-RIZE is already backed by over $2B in tokenized assets and partnerships across 150 countries, connecting asset owners to global investors through regulatory primary and secondary markets.

Its native token, $RIZE, powers transaction fees, governance, premium feature access, and AI-driven insights. As such, its success hinges on T-RIZE's success.

Since T-RIZE announced that $RIZE is now listed on the Revolut app, its price has jumped by more than 33% in just 24 hours.

With $RIZE tapping into Revolut's 60M+ global users, now signals a good opportunity to purchase the token for around $0.063 before it continues attracting more attention.

Snorter Token ($SNORT) is the native token of Snorter Bot, a cutting-edge trading bot primed to launch on Telegram this quarter.

It'll initially gear up on Solana, promising the lowest fees (0.85%) and fastest execution on the network compared to other bots, including Maestro and Trojan.

Afterward, it'll expand multi-chain, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and Base. By doing so, it'll enable you to trade promising projects across major networks through a single, streamlined interface.

From the get-go, it'll give you access to advanced features like copy trading, limit orders, and automated sniping so you can explore hot opportunities quickly to help boost your gains.

Cryptocurrency is a fast-moving and unpredictable world. Many people dream of spotting the next altcoin pump, when the price of a smaller crypto suddenly rises by a large percentage, before it happens. 

While there's no guaranteed way to predict pumps perfectly, ChatGPT can be a powerful tool to help you do smarter research, spot patterns and filter noise from real signals.

This article breaks down how to use ChatGPT to analyze altcoins, track trends and identify early indicators of a potential pump. 

What is an altcoin pump?

An altcoin pump is a sudden and sharp increase in the price of an alternative cryptocurrency — i.e., any crypto that's not Bitcoin BTCUSD. This usually happens when:

A group of traders starts buying quickly (sometimes coordinated in pump groups).

Big news or social media hype pushes the price up.

A new exchange listing or partnership is announced.

Influencers or YouTubers start talking about the coin.

Sometimes pumps are organic and driven by real growth. Other times, they're manipulated and short-lived (also known as pump-and-dump schemes). Your goal is to spot potential real growth before the crowd does.

Can ChatGPT predict pumps?

Not exactly. ChatGPT doesn't have a crystal ball. It can't tell the future or access real-time prices unless connected to external tools. But what it can do is:

Analyze altcoin fundamentals (utility, team, tokenomics)

Summarize community sentiment from forums, Reddit, X, etc.

Detect historical patterns from past pumps

Generate watchlists based on criteria you choose

Create strategies for monitoring altcoins.

Basically, ChatGPT acts like your crypto research assistant, helping you make educated guesses instead of blindly chasing hype.

Step-by-step: How to use ChatGPT for altcoin pump research

You can use the “Search” feature of ChatGPT to quickly find up-to-date crypto trends, news and market analysis across the web.

1. Identify what you want to track

Before using ChatGPT, decide on your angle. For example:

Are you tracking low-market-cap coins under $50 million?

Do you want coins that are trending on social media?

Are you looking for coins with upcoming events (like token burns or listings)?

The more specific you are, the better the results.

2. Use smart prompts

Let's look at two example prompts you can use with ChatGPT to research altcoins:

Prompt example 1: Altcoin watchlist based on fundamentals

“Act as a crypto research assistant. Give me a list of 5 altcoins under a $100 million market cap with strong utility, active development teams, and upcoming catalysts (like exchange listings, partnerships, or events). Summarize in 120 words.”

ChatGPT's response provides a clear and concise list of five low-cap altcoins, summarizing their utility, development status and upcoming catalysts in about 120 words as requested. It effectively highlights key points for quick analysis but lacks citation details for credibility and deeper verification. Do verify onchain data and up-to-date project information before making any investment decisions.

Prompt example 2: Analyze pump potential from social buzz

“Assume the role of a crypto market analyst. Analyze which altcoins are gaining the most attention on X, Reddit, and YouTube in the past 7 days. Look for sudden spikes in mentions, positive sentiment, or trending hashtags. Which ones might be getting ready to pump? Summarize in 100 words.”

ChatGPT highlighted trending altcoins by analyzing social traction across X, Reddit and YouTube over the past seven days. It clearly identifies Remittix, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Little Pepe as tokens with rising mentions and positive sentiment, suggesting potential price movement. However, it should also caution readers to verify onchain data and use up-to-date market info before acting on social trends.

3. Combine ChatGPT insights with other tools

ChatGPT works best when paired with data tools, such as:

CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap: For tracking market caps and price changes

LunarCrush: For social sentiment

DEXTools or TokenSniffer: For new coin launches and on-chain data

X and Reddit: To catch buzz early.

4. Be careful: Red flags to watch out for

Not all pumps are good. Be on alert for coins that:

Have anonymous teams

Promise massive returns quickly

Have very low liquidity or trading volume

Are trending in known pump-and-dump Telegram groups.

You can ask ChatGPT to check for red flags:

“Name 5 low-cap altcoins that might be a scam or pump-and-dump project.”

ChatGPT's response lists five examples of tokens linked to scam-like or pump‑and‑dump behavior, including real-world cases like Save the Kids and SafeMoon. It also explains common patterns with unnamed micro‑cap memecoins and organized hype groups. However, you should verify this information before drawing conclusions.

Caution: Don't chase every pump

While it can be exciting to hunt for the next big altcoin pump, it's important to stay grounded. Many pumps are short-lived and driven by hype or manipulation, especially in low-market-cap coins. Prices can skyrocket in minutes and crash just as fast, leaving late buyers with major losses.

Always be cautious of:

Too-good-to-be-true returns: Projects promising 10x overnight gains are often scams.

Anonymous teams or no white paper: Lack of transparency is a major red flag.

Low liquidity: If few people are trading the coin, you might not be able to sell when you need to.

Pump-and-dump groups: Telegram or Discord groups that coordinate artificial price movements are common and risky.

Use ChatGPT to identify potential, but combine it with critical thinking and outside verification. The crypto market moves fast, but slow and informed decisions usually win in the long run.

Always remember that even the best tools can't guarantee success in crypto. Use ChatGPT for research and insight, but always do your own research (DYOR).

Crypto is volatile, and even promising coins can fall in price. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.

ByChristian Catalini,

 Contributor. 

Fintech powerhouse Stripe is secretly building a high-performance blockchain called “Tempo,” per a now-removed job posting and Fortune's reporting. This payments-optimized chain would fill a critical gap in Stripe's crypto stack, complementing its recent acquisitions of stablecoin startup Bridge and wallet infrastructure provider Privy.

Stablecoins promise to make crypto mainstream by delivering faster, cheaper, more interconnected global payments. The paradox: the same move could undercut what the technology set out to achieve. Add the rush to branded rails—Robinhood's chain on Arbitrum, Coinbase's Base on the OP Stack, and now Stripe's Tempo—and we could end up close to where we started, just with block explorers. Worse, market concentration may rise if a few players use stablecoins to reach previously unimaginable scale. With the GENIUS Act now law, the next 12–18 months will likely determine the outcome. We've seen this tension before in the early internet's open web versus walled gardens.

In the history of technology, the pendulum regularly swings between centralization and decentralization. Even when a technology has a decentralizing effect, economies of scale in a new dimension—whether complementary resources, talent, brand, or distribution—inevitably become vectors of concentration. Once concentration becomes too high, the ingenuity of entrepreneurs and developers invents a new approach to reverse it.

A prominent example is the early internet, which brought a wave of entry and competition to the heavily concentrated industries of telecommunications, retail, and media—only to create the perfect conditions for today's tech giants to scale through network effects and capture a sizable share of value.

Although the underlying internet protocols remained open and neutral, massive digital platforms at the application layer walled off participants from competing services by strategically breaking interoperability. From email to social media to payments, we spend most of our time and money within the confines of what the tech giants have designed for us. And while we are clearly better off—more choice, lower prices—it's increasingly clear that some would prefer a world where platforms do not have as much power and influence over them.

Crypto's reason for existence was to break free from centralized intermediaries. After the 2008 financial crisis, Satoshi wanted to create a world where anyone could exchange value without having to trust a central bank or financial institution ever again. And while the original Bitcoin vision of a fully democratic network—“one‑CPU‑one‑vote”—didn't pan out due to economies of scale in mining, Bitcoin did deliver what more and more financial institutions and some governments now recognize as a novel and neutral financial asset.

Inspired by Bitcoin, entrepreneurs and developers have applied the same principles in an attempt to bring decentralization back to other digital platforms—starting with payments, but branching out into finance, marketplaces, messaging, and social media. Overall, progress toward decentralization is mixed: while it's true that Bitcoin allows anyone around the world to be their own bank, the vast majority of consumers and institutions rely heavily on intermediaries for custody and use. Similarly, solutions that offer consumers greater control over their private data and the content they create have stayed niche—often because they lag in usability and convenience relative to the centralized counterparts they're trying to replace. Convenience eats privacy for lunch any day—and it's difficult to undo the entrenched network effects of the leading digital platforms.

In payments, the most critical battle is unfolding now. Legacy infrastructure is siloed, and incumbents have tremendous power over what we can access—and on what terms. Because of winner‑take‑all dynamics, markets can become so concentrated that the public sector has to step in—the most salient example is China's introduction of a central bank digital currency to unravel the payments oligopoly established by Ant Group and Tencent.

Crypto is a natural, market‑driven solution to this. It provides neutral and decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, as well as truly open and interoperable financial rails via their base layers. But as the technology has matured, two core problems have emerged.

The first problem is that cryptocurrencies are volatile and therefore expensive for payments and financial contracts. To address this, the market has focused on fiat‑backed stablecoins; this inevitably leads to centralization because issuance and sound management require a regulated financial entity to be in charge of—and accountable for—reserve operations. While distributed governance of a stablecoin network is technically possible, it is extremely difficult to get the design right. Libra is the most prominent example: despite backing from more than two dozen leading global companies and countless resources dedicated to establishing credible distributed governance, the project was always perceived as Meta's initiative.

Banks have tried for more than a decade to come together as consortia in response to crypto, and, to date, no joint project has delivered anything tangible. The reason is obvious: until the situation is truly dire, competitors are unlikely to commit to a joint solution—so, in the meantime, everyone hedges their bets across multiple tracks.

Intuitively, distributed ownership of a stablecoin network makes sense and is not that different from what ultimately made Visa scale in the 1970s—when Bank of America relinquished control of the BankAmericard credit card program to respond to increasing competition from the consortium that would become Mastercard.

Networks of crypto exchanges and fintechs, such as the Global Dollar Network, may be able to move faster, given the agility of the new entrants backing them, but they will still need to strike the right balance between economic incentives and governance to shift members from a wait‑and‑see mode—where everyone hopes to free‑ride on others' efforts—into action. Even Circle's Centre Consortium, which had only Circle and Coinbase as members, was dissolved and converted into a simple revenue‑sharing agreement.

So, while there might be a solution to the decentralized governance of a stablecoin, what we know is that, to date, the only working model is one that places a single entity in charge of everything. This is, of course, problematic in the long term, and while issuers today control only the asset, they have already started expanding their offerings in ways that limit openness. For example, Circle announced its payment network (CPN), which places it at the center of how payments are executed—from defining rules and eligibility, to inserting itself into every API interaction and price and liquidity discovery, to, of course, collecting a fee. Put together, this setup is not that different from the model that has allowed Visa and Mastercard to dominate payments for decades.

The second problem crypto has run into is one that is deeply tied to its roots: decentralization is expensive. The economic consequence is that you can only afford it where it truly matters. To date, among networks at scale, that's been true only for the base layers of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. At most, that yields a few thousand decentralized transactions per second globally across all of them combined—a far cry from what global payments would require, even before you layer financial services on top.

As a result, most transactions no longer occur on the base layers (L1s) but on a sprawling ecosystem of high‑throughput scaling solutions (L2s). L2s offer near‑zero fees and instant settlement, and they're profitable because they internalize Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)—the gains from reordering, inserting, or omitting transactions in a block.

While crypto purists might decry this trend, it aligns precisely with economic theory: users are willing to pay a premium for decentralization and censorship resistance at the core settlement layer, yet they readily trade some of that for greater centralization in higher layers to gain lower costs and faster speeds. The base layers remain open and trustless, and depending on the application, participants may compromise further—even embracing fully trusted, centralized solutions.

This trade‑off is broader than a user's decision to be their own bank and self‑custody funds versus accepting some degree of trust in a third‑party wallet. When building products, Coinbase, Robinhood, and the like care deeply that the underlying network stays neutral and does not play favorites among applications, developers, or businesses—the way the tech giants do on their platforms. Essentially, they are willing to pay for decentralization and neutrality to reduce the risk of hold‑up and expropriation—something that has repeatedly played out on traditional digital platforms.

To fully grasp what fast, low‑cost L2s will do to payments and competition in crypto, look no further than what the internet did to news and media: as the cost of distributing—and now, with AI, also generating—large swaths of content fell to zero, business models had to evolve drastically, and massive aggregators (Google, Facebook, Spotify, etc.) emerged to take advantage of the new economics at play. Because L2s remove friction, offer convenience, and allow builders to deliver experiences much closer to traditional fintech products, they are the obvious layer where most of the value will be created—and appropriated.

Furthermore, as basic money becomes free and commoditized, competition shifts to the value‑added services and workflows associated with it. That's exactly where fintechs, neobanks, crypto exchanges, and even traditional financial institutions have a significant advantage.

Any one of these players, if it executes well over the next couple of years, can use the technology to establish the first truly massive and global financial network. Once it reaches scale, it could also progressively degrade interoperability, appropriating more of the value—much as today's internet giants did.

So what's the most likely scenario? Based on how strong and persistent network effects have been in crypto over the last decade, it's safe to assume that payments and financial services will disproportionately gravitate toward a couple of leading blockchains. The remaining chains will need to specialize within an industry vertical to stay relevant. Most activity will take place not on their decentralized base layers but on scaling layers branded and shaped by crypto and fintech players (e.g., Base, Robinhood Chain), applications (e.g., Unichain, World Chain), and financial institutions (e.g., Kinexys, Fnality, Partior).

Players that control distribution—whether on the consumer, merchant, or institutional side—have a massive advantage, as they own the interface between the blockchain and the real world. Blockchains drastically lower the cost of verifying and coordinating onchain data, but their value is limited without a strong nexus with complementary offchain information—identity, compliance, credentials, creditworthiness, and more. That's where friction persists—and where economies of scale will decide winners and losers.

This is why stablecoin issuers have strong incentives either to commoditize the rails—by issuing on multiple networks and positioning themselves at the center of interoperability across them (e.g., Circle's Cross‑Chain Transfer Protocol)—or to nudge most activity to a network they control, such as a new L2 or a higher‑level protocol like CPN. Either strategy gives them a shot at becoming massive global fintech leaders and capturing most of the value the technology creates.

Meanwhile, crypto and fintech players will want to shift those same valuable transactions to a network over which they have more sway, such as a branded L2. In doing so, they'll also want either to commoditize stablecoins and other tokenized assets, or to issue their own. In the latter scenario, stablecoins may well be used as a loss leader to expand the reach of a fintech's offering, and domestic stablecoins will be issued to gain more control over the FX market and support local use cases. Real‑world assets (RWAs), memecoins, other tokens, and applications that are truly differentiated and exclusive to those networks may also help these branded chains retain volume within their borders. The same companies will be able to develop clever rewards and loyalty programs that increase consumer and business stickiness within their ecosystems.

As convenience and economic reality win over dogmatism, crypto will look very different than it is today. The good news is that, as part of that transformation, it will be far more useful. And while that may come with more centralization, the fact that the underlying protocols are open source and forkable means that, no matter how large some players may become, they face more pressure to retain greater interoperability than under the status quo. 
 It is also possible that because crypto protocols allow for new market design and incentives, the ultimate solution will be something that was not quite achievable for the internet protocols—which did not have built‑in monetization mechanisms. Regardless, once centralization materializes, some clever group of developers will work hard to undo it, and the cycle will repeat.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

The company will use the new funding to roll out this solution in Europe, Asia and North America, expand its operations and add to its engineering team, according to a Tuesday (Aug. 12) press release emailed to PYMNTS.

Riva was established earlier this year and is now inviting companies to join its waitlist, according to a banner on its website.

Riva uses a combination of traditional and blockchain-based payment routing to optimize each payment's speed and cost, according to the press release.

With this solution, the company aims to modernize B2B payments by addressing the often-unfavorable exchange rates and slow settlement times associated with cross-border transfers that are routed through banks and financial institutions, the release said.

Riva powers international payments with blockchain technology, including stablecoins, or with traditional fiat-to-fiat rails, depending on what is the best option for the client's money transfers, based on their location and other circumstances, per the release.

The company is working to obtain authorization as a payment institution across the United Kingdom and the European Union, a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license in the EU and a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license in Switzerland, according to the release.

“By combining blockchain technology with a robust regulatory framework, we're building a solution that offers businesses the speed, transparency and cost-efficiency they need to thrive in today's interconnected economy,” Riva Money co-founder and CEO Niklas Hoejman said in the release.

Malin Posern, partner and managing director at Project A, which led the funding round, said in the release that the time is right for an “infrastructure rethink” because stablecoin adoption is accelerating and regulatory frameworks are maturing.

“Riva's dual-rail system for businesses elegantly solves for both speed and flexibility in a market that's still reliant on legacy processes,” Posern said.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report “The Treasury Management Playbook: Spotlight on Cross-Border Payments” found that cross-border payments are undergoing a revolution as new solutions deliver cost-effective, real-time payment options with maximum visibility for senders and receivers.

This structure aims to create a sense of shared ownership and incentivize engagement among users. Additionally, the integration of NFTs goes beyond mere collectibility—these digital assets provide tangible benefits such as ticket multipliers and access to premium in-real-life (IRL) events. For example, some NFTs offer a 20% ticket multiplier, allowing users to receive six tickets for the price of five [1].

A special NFT collection, known as the “CryptoLottery Owners Pass,” has been introduced with a total supply of 150 units. These NFTs are built on the Solana blockchain and are available at no cost. Holders of the Owners Pass receive additional privileges and benefits, reinforcing the platform's commitment to rewarding engaged participants [1].

CryptoLottery also combines the excitement of live, in-real-life draws with the transparency of blockchain verification. This hybrid model allows players to experience the spectacle of traditional lottery events while benefiting from the auditability and trust provided by blockchain technology. The result is a platform that seeks to merge entertainment with verifiable fairness [1].

Michael Gonzalez, founder of CryptoLottery and former founder of FitTea, emphasized that the platform was developed to modernize lotteries for a digital-first world. He highlighted the platform's commitment to transparency, accessibility, and real value for global players. This vision aligns with the broader adoption of blockchain-based services in the lottery and gaming sectors [1].

CryptoLottery positions itself as the official lottery of Web3, aiming to bring the thrill of global lottery draws to a decentralized and digital-first audience. With its focus on instant payouts, community ownership, and NFT utility, the platform represents a new approach to lottery platforms that leverages the strengths of blockchain technology. As the Web3 ecosystem continues to evolve, platforms like CryptoLottery may play a significant role in redefining how users engage with digital rewards and value [1].

The meme coin market is showing signs that another strong upside phase could be approaching. In past cycles, when conditions align like this, certain tokens have recorded gains of 10x or even 100x within a short span.

Larger names such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu still see steady demand, but their substantial market caps reduce the likelihood of the outsized returns that meme coin traders typically target.

That is why attention is increasingly moving toward early stage projects that have yet to launch. These coins combine smaller valuations with the potential to capture attention quickly once they list, creating a profile that better matches the growth expectations of speculative traders in this sector.

Entering a meme coin during its ICO or presale phase gives investors a set of opportunities that are rarely matched once the token is live. Crypto ICOs are typically structured with tiered pricing, meaning the earliest participants secure the lowest entry cost.

As the ICO progresses, the price per token usually steps up, offering an immediate advantage to those who acted first. In a bullish market environment, this early positioning can translate into significant upside once trading begins.

Beyond the price benefit, many of the best crypto ICOs introduce high APY staking programs that allow holders to grow their allocation before the coin is even listed. This can be especially valuable for those intending to hold through the initial launch volatility. In addition, early participants are often eligible for exclusive airdrops, community giveaways, or reward campaigns designed to incentivise engagement. These extras can sometimes generate meaningful returns on their own.

Timing also plays an important role, as projects that conclude their ICOs just as the crypto market is entering a strong upward phase often experience amplified demand, leading to rapid appreciation in value. For investors seeking both positioning and potential, presale meme coins offer a rare combination of low cost access, added rewards, and the possibility of entering just before a market wide rally takes hold.

We will look at a group of meme coins currently in presale that fit all of these conditions. They combine the cultural pull and community driven energy that fuel meme coin rallies with the structural advantages of early stage entry. Each one has the potential to capture attention quickly after launch, and in the right market conditions, they could deliver massive returns that have defined the most memorable runs in this sector.

Maxi Doge has been building quietly but steadily, introducing itself to investors as a degen themed yet determined presence in the meme coin arena. It is not trying to be a complex protocol or a layered financial product.



Instead, its strength lies in the clarity of its identity, a mascot and tone that remain consistent across every post, contest, and community interaction. In the meme coin market, that consistency matters. Traders know what they are getting, and the visual branding is easy to spot in fast moving feeds.

Right now, Maxi Doge is still in presale, which means the current price is the lowest it will ever be before listings. This stage attracts those who understand how entry cost can influence potential upside. A smaller starting valuation creates more room for aggressive percentage moves if the token gains traction after launch. Despite its recent launch, Maxi Doge has already managed to be featured across top crypto based websites and YouTube channels like Jacob Crypto Bury and many others.

The community, while not massive yet, is showing the right kind of behaviour, constant discussion, user made memes, and willingness to keep the project visible even when market chatter shifts elsewhere. This is often the difference between an ICO token that fades and one that catches fire.

In meme coin cycles, momentum tends to reward projects with an active, recognisable presence before they even hit exchanges. Maxi Doge's early supporters seem committed to pushing it into that category, making the initial coin offering window a chance to get in while the floor is still low.

TOKEN6900 has leaned fully into its absurd, tongue in cheek identity. Everything about it, from its name to its social media tone, is designed to be instantly shareable. That matters in meme coin culture, where the fastest moving tokens are often the ones that can make people laugh, confuse them just enough to be intrigued, and then get them to share it with others.



The presale is still open, and the pricing steps upward with each stage. Investors who secure an allocation now are getting in before later rounds push the entry cost higher. This structure creates urgency, but it also rewards those who are early with more price headroom once trading begins.

Community traction for TOKEN6900 has been growing at a rate that suggests organic pull rather than paid noise. Group chats stay active at all hours, content creation is constant, and smaller holders seem just as vocal as the bigger buyers. This matters because meme coin surges are often driven less by a single announcement and more by relentless, unpredictable community driven activity.

In the meme coin sector, branding alone is not enough. The network effect has to be strong enough to keep people talking. TOKEN6900 appears to have that mix of novelty and persistence. The presale period is giving those paying attention a window to secure their stake before the real social push begins at launch.

Snorter takes a different route from most meme coins by pairing its playful branding with a working Telegram-based AI bot. While the token still taps into the same culture of jokes, memes, and constant conversation, it also offers something functional that traders can use. That combination often attracts two types of buyers, those who want the fun and those who see an extra reason to hold.



Being in presale gives early participants two key advantages. First, they can buy at the bottom price before the tiered increases take effect. Second, they can stake their tokens immediately at high annual yields, growing their position while the token is still private. This approach builds both scarcity and loyalty before the first day of public trading.

Community presence is already strong. Conversations are not just about the bot or the presale progress, but also about the memes and running jokes that keep people engaged. Snorter's ability to operate in both worlds, the humour driven meme space and the utility driven product space, gives it a depth that most presale meme coins do not have.

If market sentiment shifts upward while Snorter is moving from ICO to listing (IEO), both aspects of its identity could work in its favour. Early buyers would then not only be holding a meme coin with a growing user base but also one tied to an active product, an uncommon combination in this niche.

Bitcoin Hyper manages to walk the line between meme coin energy and genuine blockchain infrastructure. On one side, it borrows the branding power of Bitcoin's name and wraps it in a lighter, more irreverent tone that fits meme culture.



On the other, it is being built as a Bitcoin based Layer 2 network designed to improve transaction speed and usability. This gives it an underlying structure that separates it from tokens that rely solely on community hype.

The presale stage is still active, giving early buyers the lowest entry price available. With a stepped pricing format, every round that sells out increases the token cost for the next, making timing a central factor for anyone looking to maximise position size before trading begins.

Bitcoin Hyper also offers staking during presale at high annual yields, allowing participants to grow their holdings before the token even lists. This can significantly boost allocation, especially for those planning to hold through the early market swings after launch.

— Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) August 9, 2025



Its community mixes the typical meme coin banter with discussions about Layer 2 scaling and Bitcoin's ecosystem. This mix is unusual, but it works in Bitcoin Hyper's favour as it attracts traders looking for fast moving speculative plays as well as those interested in infrastructure projects with a cultural hook. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Hyper has raised over $8.8 million, further proving its increasing demand in the volatile meme coin market space.

If the presale concludes at the same time the wider market is accelerating upward, Bitcoin Hyper could benefit from both meme coin momentum and interest in functional blockchain layers. For early participants, that overlap could be a decisive advantage.

In meme coin cycles, the biggest moves often come without warning. By the time a token is listed and trending, the early pricing window has already closed. Meme token ICOs change that equation. They allow entry while valuations are still low, with the added benefit of staking rewards, giveaways, and the kind of early community growth that can spark rapid momentum.

The tokens discussed above are building now, not reacting later. Each combines a clear identity with active support, and in some cases, features that extend beyond pure speculation. If the market shifts into a higher gear, these early foundations can translate into fast gains. For traders who value timing as much as selection, acting before the crowd arrives is often the difference between catching the move and chasing it.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Tanvirul Islam Prince, founder of ECM Coin, is integrating blockchain into e-commerce to address the lack of decentralized payment infrastructure.

- The ECM ecosystem includes live platforms like AndroMarkets and a planned ICO to fund blockchain development and metaverse expansion.

- ECM Coin aims to bridge the $8 trillion e-commerce gap with low-fee transactions and real-world usability, not just as an investment asset.

- Supported by BigBull Capital and Al Wadiat, the project emphasizes security through audits and token burns to protect investors.

Tanvirul Islam Prince, founder of ECM Coin and CEO of METAFUSION LABS LLC, is pioneering the integration of blockchain technology into the global e-commerce sector. With a 15-year background in capital markets, including experience in crypto, forex, and stocks, Prince identified a significant gap in the e-commerce industry: the absence of a blockchain-based payment infrastructure tailored for real-world commerce [1]. In 2020, he conceptualized ECM Coin, and by 2022, the platform began building community engagement through MyCoinPoll.com. Today, the ECM ecosystem includes multiple platforms such as bCoinMart, AndroMarkets, CryptoCoinEarning, and the Androverse metaverse [1].

The ECM Coin ICO is currently live, offering 50 million tokens at $1.20 each. Funds raised will support the development of the ECM Blockchain, integration with e-commerce platforms, expansion of the crypto exchange, and growth of the metaverse economy. The project has a clear long-term roadmap extending through 2028, including international exchange listings, strategic e-commerce partnerships, and the launch of ECM payment gateways [1]. The company also plans regular token burn events to manage supply and value [1].

What distinguishes ECM Coin is its integrated ecosystem, which spans exchange, staking, and metaverse components under one brand. Unlike many blockchain projects, several of its ecosystem components are already operational, including AndroMarkets, which is live and functioning ahead of the ICO's completion. This early delivery is seen as a strong indicator of the project's capability and real-world readiness [1].

The global e-commerce market is projected to exceed $8 trillion USD by 2027, yet cryptocurrencies currently account for less than 2% of transactions. ECM Coin aims to bridge this gap by offering low-fee, fast transactions and seamless integration for both consumers and merchants. Prince emphasized that the goal is not to create another investment asset but to build a digital currency that can be used for daily transactions [1].

Security and transparency are core to the ECM Coin project. The company has committed to regular audits and public reporting on development milestones. Tokenomics are structured with clear allocations and planned token burns, reinforcing a transparent approach to investor protection [1].

The project is supported by BigBull Capital LLC and angel investor Al Wadiat Financing Broker. Prince leads a global team of 45+ members in executing the vision of a blockchain-powered e-commerce future [1].

The ECM ICO is currently open for participation, with opportunities for investors, merchants, and partners to engage through official channels. The project's upcoming ECM Blockchain mainnet is targeted for launch in Q4 2025 [1].

Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) may have lost some of their allure globally, but Rwanda is marching on with its CBDC project. The country's central bank is calling on citizens to pitch in with their ideas on how to best implement a digital Rwandan franc.

Further south, Botswana has launched a feasibility study to evaluate the risks and benefits of a CBDC.

Rwanda targets payment innovation, cheaper remittances with CBDC

The Central Bank of Rwanda (BNR) has launched a retail CBDC ideathon, inviting any Rwandan citizen, company, startup, or corporation to share their proposals and help shape the country's digital payments future.

BNR says it intends to involve all financial industry stakeholders from the start to “foster innovation and competition in the digital finance ecosystem,” in line with the country's National Fintech Strategy (2024-2029).

Rwandans have until August 15 to register their interest, and one month after that to submit their ideas. By the end of September, the bank will have selected the best ideas and awarded the ideators.

Rwanda remains among a few countries in Africa that have retained interest in CBDCs, with most now exploring other financial innovations as the CBDC hype has died down. Some, like Kenya, say a digital currency isn't a priority as financial inclusion is already high. Others, like South Africa, are monitoring global developments but are exploring alternatives like stablecoins.

Nigeria is the only African nation to launch a digital currency with its e-Naira, but adoption has been disappointing. Local companies are now shifting to stablecoins, with cNGN launching earlier this year as the country's first regulated stablecoin.

Still, Rwanda persists with its CBDC project. BNR says it has been conducting closed-loop tests with a limited user group to build a better understanding of the technology, user experience, and potential risks.

The test “focuses on legal frameworks, cybersecurity, and payment system integration,” the bank says.

The participants have included staff from the CBR, local lenders, merchants, and a select group of institutions. The project will run for five months, with the results expected by early October.

The central bank reiterated that the testing doesn't imply it will launch the digital franc. Instead, it will use the results to guide its next steps.

BNR says it has identified over a dozen potential opportunities but has narrowed in on four major “sweet spots.”

The first is to enhance the resilience of its payments system; the CBDC would be accessible offline and via USSD, which shields it from power outages and network disruptions. Second, it would promote innovation and competition, with a BNR study finding that a duopoly in the mobile payments sector by MTN and Airtel has driven up transaction costs. A digital franc would provide a cheaper alternative, forcing these telecoms to lower charges and offer better services.

The CBDC would also boost Rwanda's journey toward a cashless economy and enable faster and cheaper remittances.

Local innovators have supported the CBDC project but called on the top bank to focus on making it accessible through USSD codes and offline transactions.

“Retail use of the CBDC should be the focus to be able to bring in as many users as possible. This helps to learn fast and iterate on what works and what doesn't,” commented Bobson Rugambwa, the CEO of local fintech Mvend.

Botswana conducts CBDC feasibility study

In Botswana, the government is conducting a feasibility study to determine if it should develop a CBDC.

Ruth Baitshepi, who heads the innovation hub at the Bank of Botswana, recently revealed that the bank is in the early stages of its CBDC journey.

“First and foremost, we want to determine if there is even a need for a CBDC in Botswana and whether the emergence of digital assets poses any threat to the sovereignty of the Pula to necessitate a CBDC,” she said during a media briefing, local outlets report.

Botswana is home to 2.5 million citizens, despite being among the 50 largest countries by land area, making it one of the most sparsely populated nations globally. In the past five years, mobile payments have spiked, boosting financial inclusion. However, one in three Batswana remains unbanked.

				European officials fear any hopes of the euro becoming a serious contender to the American currency will be quashed.			

The rise of dollar-linked stablecoins threatens Europe's push to elevate the euro's global standing and may ultimately weaken the European Central Bank's control over the economy, three ECB officials told POLITICO.

Their comments come following a seminar on stablecoins — cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of official currencies — held alongside the ECB's regular policy meeting in July. 

Policymakers' scrutiny of these fast-growing digital assets has also increased as their market value has more than doubled — from $125 billion to roughly $255 billion — in under two years. Nearly 99 percent of that is tied to the U.S. dollar.

Officials fear the increasing adoption of stablecoins could entrench dollar dominance in global finance and quash any hopes of the euro becoming a serious contender to the U.S. currency.

“This trend hurts Europe's efforts to boost the international role of the euro and the geopolitical influence that comes with it,” said one Governing Council member, granted anonymity to speak freely about a sensitive topic.

The recent U.S.-EU trade deal served as a stark reminder of how much U.S. dominance over the global financial system affects the transatlantic power balance. Acutely aware that Europe is punching below its weight, ECB President Christine Lagarde urged Europe's leaders to seize the “euro moment” created by the shift in the global order to boost the role of the single currency.

The U.S. administration has supported developing dollar-linked stablecoins as a way to shore up the greenback, even as uncontrolled budget deficits, erratic trade policy and political interference in monetary policy and economic data reporting all work to undermine international confidence.

Most current stablecoin activity is concentrated in emerging markets, prompting ECB executive board member Piero Cipollone to warn of ""destabilizing effects"" as a result of  “digital dollarization”, particularly on emerging markets and less developed economies. But ECB officials warn that if European consumers turn to dollar-backed digital assets in large numbers, it could pose a significant risk to control of the money supply in the eurozone.  

“Should U.S. dollar stablecoins become widely used in the euro area, whether for payments, savings or settlement, the ECB's control over monetary conditions could be weakened,” Jürgen Schaaf, a long-time digital euro advisor in the ECB's Market Infrastructure and Payments department, said in a blog post last week. “Without a strategic response, European monetary sovereignty and financial stability could erode.”

For years, ECB officials have framed the launch of a digital euro as Europe's most effective response to the threat posed by foreign digital currencies. The goal is to provide a trusted, euro-denominated alternative that would make it safer and easier for citizens and businesses to stay within the eurozone's monetary framework. A digital euro would offer the advantages of digital currencies without the currency substitution risk.

Lagarde has redoubled her efforts to move the project forward, urging lawmakers to act swiftly. “A legislative framework to pave the way for the potential introduction of a digital euro should be put in place rapidly,” she told the European Parliament in June, calling it a “strategic priority” to address the risks posed by stablecoins.

According to one member, the Governing Council remains skeptical of stablecoins, echoing concerns voiced by the Bank for International Settlements that they fail to meet the standards of “sound money” and suffer from insufficient regulation.

Another colleague, however, acknowledged there may be a limited role for euro-linked stablecoins serving as a bridge between the two systems until the digital euro is launched, which could still take several years. Similarly, Schaaf noted that they “could serve legitimate market needs” and “could also reinforce the international role of the euro.”

There tends to be a broad divide between politically left- and right-leaning economists, with the latter generally more open towards supporting a technology that has been largely advanced by the private sector.

Economists Jens van 't Klooster, Edoardo Martino, and Eric Monnet are convinced that mimicking the U.S. stablecoin model would be a strategic misstep. “This is neither realistic, given the incumbency advantage of the dollar, nor is euroization of third countries through risky stablecoins per se good for the EU,” they wrote in a recent paper for the Center for Economic Policy Research.

Instead, they urged Brussels to focus on positioning the euro as a globally trusted, safe asset — backed by sound institutions and regulation.

“The EU should stick to promoting the internationalization of the euro as a safe asset that can be held without constraint,” they argued. Third countries may then use the euro to offset the risk of stable coin-driven  dollarization, raising long-term demand for the single currency.

The omission of the pioneering scientist's maiden name needled Warsaw and sparked fierce lobbying.

China's rise and democratic backsliding in other countries are making a mockery of Europe's efforts to spread its values through trade.

European Council President António Costa wants to discuss international role for euro but divisions over  large-scale joint borrowing are as wide as ever.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Disgraced crypto exec Do Kwon pleads guilty to fraud charges in $40B collapse","https://nypost.com/2025/08/12/business/do-kwon-to-plead-guilty-in-40b-crypto-collapse/","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 16:01:31 GMT","

Do Kwon, the South Korean cryptocurrency entrepreneur behind two digital currencies that lost an estimated $40 billion in 2022, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to two charges of conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud.

Kwon, 33, who co-founded Singapore-based Terraform Labs and developed the TerraUSD and Luna currencies, entered the plea at a court hearing in New York before US District Judge Paul Engelmayer.

He had pleaded not guilty in January to a nine-count indictment charging him with securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud and money laundering conspiracy.

Accused of misleading investors in 2021 about TerraUSD – a so-called stablecoin designed to maintain a value of $1 – Kwon pleaded guilty to the two counts under an agreement with the Manhattan US Attorney's office, which brought the charges.

He faces up to 25 years in prison when Engelmayer sentences him on Dec. 11, though prosecutor Kimberly Ravener said the government had agreed to advocate for a prison term of no more than 12 years provided he accepts responsibility for his crimes.

Kwon is one of several cryptocurrency moguls to face federal charges after a slump in digital token prices in 2022 prompted the collapse of a number of companies.

Prosecutors alleged that when TerraUSD slipped below its $1 peg in May 2021, he told investors a computer algorithm known as “Terra Protocol” had restored the coin's value.

Instead, they said, he arranged for a high-frequency trading firm to secretly buy millions of dollars of the token to artificially prop up its price.

Prosecutors said that false claim and others drove retail and institutional investors to buy Terraform products and boost the value of Luna – a more traditional token that fluctuated in value but was closely linked to TerraUSD – to $50 billion by the spring of 2022.

In court, Kwon apologized for his conduct.

“I made false and misleading statements about why it regained its peg by failing to disclose a trading firm's role in restoring that peg,” Kwon said. “What I did was wrong.”

Kwon agreed in 2024 to pay $80 million as a civil fine and be banned from crypto transactions as part of a $4.55 billion settlement he and Terraform reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Kwon has been detained since his extradition from Montenegro late last year.

He also faces charges in South Korea. As part of the deal, prosecutors will not oppose Kwon's potential application to be transferred abroad after serving half his US sentence, Ravener said.

 The end of the almost five-year legal dispute will enable the agency to dedicate more time to developing clear regulatory frameworks, according to SEC Chair Paul Atkins. 

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is signaling an increasing focus on developing a clear cryptocurrency regulatory framework after ending one of the industry's longest-running legal battles.

The SEC and Ripple Labs ended their almost five-year dispute after both parties filed to drop their legal appeals and bear their costs and fees, according to a filing last Thursday with the Second Circuit Appeals Court. 

The case's conclusion is a “welcome development” that ensures “minds once occupied with litigation now can concentrate on creating a clear regulatory framework for crypto,” said SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce in a Monday X post.

“With this chapter closed, we now have an opportunity to shift our energy from the courtroom to the policy drafting table,” said SEC Chair Paul Atkins in response to Peirce's post. “Our focus should be on building a clear regulatory framework that fosters innovation while protecting investors,” he added.

The SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, alleging the company raised $1.3 billion through unregistered XRP securities sales. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP was not a security when sold to retail investors but was a security in sales to institutions. Ripple was fined $125 million in August 2024.

The end of the case comes as lawmakers advance the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, known as the CLARITY Act. The bill aims to define the structure of digital asset markets.

Republican lawmakers and the Senate Banking Committee aim to pass the bill by Sept. 30 despite growing signs of pushback from Democratic Party lawmakers.

Earlier in July, leading Democratic Party members in the House of Representatives announced a collective effort to oppose Republican efforts to pass so-called “dangerous” legislation, signaling deepening political division between the two sides of the aisle.

“[Republicans are] doubling down by fast-tracking a dangerous package of crypto legislation through Congress,” said House Financial Services Committee ranking member Maxine Waters, specifically criticizing the CLARITY Act and the  Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which seeks to prohibit the launch of a US central bank digital currency.

Circle (NYSE:CRCL) is the big IPO winner so far this year, returning 418% from its first day of trading, while AI player CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) sports a 173% gain since it listed in early June.[2] The latest IPO craze surrounds Figma (NYSE:FIG), a browser-based designing interface company, which brought about mid-late 1990s vibes when it began trading in July.

But is the shine coming off the 2025 IPO Cinderella story? CRCL was cut in half from its June peak to below $150 for a time last week, CRWV dropped 55% over the early summer, and FIG fell hard after an early burst. Still, the Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO), which holds shares of recent IPOs, notched fresh highs going back to Q1 2022 as August got underway.

It's clear that the IPO environment is more conducive than it was a few quarters ago, but there's still uncertainty for currently private companies considering testing the public waters. Sure, it's high times for AI and crypto adjacent going concerns, but companies in other, more cyclical industries may still be treading lightly.?

Recent manufacturing and services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) readings have not been all that upbeat, while earnings growth away from the Magnificent Seven stocks is paltry. Thus, the story with IPOs mirrors what we see in most of the US stock market: Party on in tech (AI and crypto, specifically) and good luck to everyone else, particularly domestic small and mid-sized companies.

Space startup Firefly Aerospace (NASDAQ:FLY) hit the tape last week on Thursday August 7th, and it aims for more durable success than Voyager Technologies (NYSE:VOYG), which popped and dropped after its June IPO.

What happens this week with Bullish (which trades under the ticker BLSH) will be the latest data point on the broader trend. Pressure was undoubtedly on its underwriters in the wake of Figma's pricing. FIG priced at $33, opened at $85, then peaked on its second session at $142. Its market cap topped out near $70 billion, which (at the time) made it larger than 340 S&P 500 constituents.

You see, when a stock is priced significantly below its post-IPO trading level, many experts argue that substantial money was left on the table. Had the underwriting banks set a higher price, original investors might have enjoyed even greater gains. Instead, the quick profits went to new shareholders who bought in at the IPO price.?

Bigger picture, there remains a clear, though gradual, upward trend in the number of new IPO filings. The count (on a trailing 12-month basis) hit a low in Q1 2024, and we've seen modest year-over-year increases since then. Not even halfway through the third quarter, and we have already reached about 70% of the total IPO filings for Q3 2024. All the while, high-profile private companies bide their time, surely eyeing that perfect moment to tap the public arena.

Who might be next? There's an online prediction market for that. According to Kalshi, bettors place an 81% chance that Klarna, a Swedish fintech company specializing in the buy now, pay later niche, will IPO by the end of the year.[3] The latest reports suggest Klarna will restart its public offering process as soon as September.

Discord, Cerebras, and Databricks are other possible IPOs as we approach the end of 2025, but the real heavyweights to come are SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Valuations run in the hundreds of billions of dollars for those private behemoths, with higher estimated price tags every time a funding round happens, it seems. Wall Street bankers are no doubt champing at the bit to organize IPO roadshows, while Elon Musk and Sam Altman could capitalize on ever-increasing valuations.

As for the ex-tech space, it may take time for macro conditions to turn more favorable for IPOs to flourish. Lower interest rates would help spur equity unlocks, so long as a protracted economic downturn is avoided. Our team will also be watching M&A trends as a potential first step toward a pickup in cyclical-sector go-public activity.

With so many massive day-one IPO winners, casual investors might think the IPO market is as hot as ever. That's not the case when eyeing the data. Still, capital markets are stronger compared to recent years, and the IPO pipeline is filled with AI and high-tech power players.

Donald Trump's deregulatory blitz has its limits.

It doesn't seem to like financial privacy, an omission that appears to have galvanised crypto devs and policy experts. 

To recap: Last week, Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm was convicted of a federal crime. The week before, the developers of Samourai Wallet pleaded guilty to the same crime. 

The same day the Samourai devs threw in the towel, Trump's crypto policy team came out with a 166-page report titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology.” Not everyone liked what they saw. 

The report recommended expanding the infamous Patriot Act to cover crypto technology, labelling certain tools “primary money laundering concerns.” It suggested to force DeFi protocols to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and its anti-money laundering provisions. 

“This could include services that custody assets or have centralised governance, including through instances in which governance tokens are held by one or a small group of persons that can effectively assert control,” the report reads. 

There is a cost to privacy. As one of Storm's prosecutors put it, “Isn't anonymity just another word for concealment?” 

The argument appeared to be that we've all got something to hide, but that criminals have more to hide. 

There's also a cost to not having privacy. As one of Storm's attorneys put it, “How would you feel if someone took your bank account and published it on the internet?” 

The received wisdom of the DeFi community is that blockchain-based finance will never go mainstream without privacy. 

The devs are fighting back. 

“To me, the medium-term target is to make privacy [the] default in wallets,” Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said in a recent appearance on the Bankless podcast. 

“The biggest mistake that we're making as an ecosystem right now is that we came up with this concept of a privacy wallet. We should not have privacy wallets — privacy should be a feature of wallets.” 

Buterin added that the Ethereum Foundation has started working on the issue, and more information can be expected in the next several months. It has also pledged an additional $500,000 towards Storm's legal costs. 

Last week, Electric Coin Company CEO Josh Swihart asked senators to protect financial privacy in a forthcoming mega-bill. 

“This is not about hiding crime; it is about protecting law-abiding citizens from constant surveillance, data breaches, and unjust profiling,” Swihart wrote. 

“Treating all privacy-oriented digital assets as suspect would be akin to banning locks because criminals might hide behind closed doors.”

PROPOSAL: Lido DAO considers token buyback program 

PROPOSAL: Polygon DAO considers raising validators' required minimum stake

Trump promised a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve stocked with crypto seized by US law enforcement. According to one rumour, the first contribution will come from a crypto developer. 

The irony of the Samourai Wallet forfeiture funds being the first official deposit into the SBR captures the current moment in Bitcoin/crypto pretty well, IMO.

Qubic, a project led by former IOTA co-founder Sergey Ivancheglo, says it has secured more than 51% of Monero's global hashrate, a milestone that, if true, gives it the ability to reorganize blocks, censor transactions, and attempt double-spends on the privacy-focused blockchain. 

Ivancheglo framed the move as a stress test to help the Monero community prepare for future network threats, but the announcement has triggered sharp debate among developers and security experts.

A 51% attack occurs when a single entity or coordinated group controls a majority of a proof-of-work network's hashrate. Ethereum Classic suffered multiple reorganizations in 2020, resulting in millions of dollars in losses, while Bitcoin Gold faced similar assaults in 2018 and 2020. 

Smaller networks like Verge have also been targeted, demonstrating how concentrated hashing power can destabilize and entire cryptocurrency network.

Monero, which uses the CPU-friendly RandomX algorithm, has long prided itself on resisting ASIC centralization. Qubic's “useful proof-of-work” (uPoW) model repurposes Monero mining rewards by converting XMR into USDT, then using the proceeds to buy and burn QUBIC tokens, a deflationary mechanism that doubles as a liquidity sink for its own ecosystem.

From mid-May to late July, Qubic's share of the network jumped from less than 2% to over 25%, at times topping pool rankings.

Ledger CTO Charles Guillemet warned on X that Monero “appears to be in the midst of a successful 51% attack,” citing signs of a major chain reorganization, with several other industry experts like SlowMist founder Yu Xian expressing their doubt over Qubic's economics.

Whether the events mark a hostile takeover or simply a stress test, XMR has responded negatively, dropping by 6.65% in the past 24 hours to compound a 16% decline over the past week.

U.S. inflation data for July came in mixed, with headline numbers better than forecast, but the core rate rising faster than expected.

The July U.S. Consumer Price Index rose 0.2%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economist forecasts had been for 0.2% and June's pace was 0.3%.

On a year-over-year basis, CPI was higher by 2.7% against 2.8% expected and 2.7% previously.

Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.3% from the prior month, compared with forecasts for 0.3% and June's 0.2% gain. On a yearly basis, core CPI increased 3.1%, versus expectations of 3% and June's 2.9%.

The data likely isn't far enough off from forecasts to lower expectations for a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut as soon as September, with market-implied odds at 84% before the release, according to CME FedWatch. Fifteen minutes following the mixed numbers, those odds had risen to 90%.

Ahead of the report, bitcoin BTC$119,417.80 was trading near $118,500, as traders hedged downside risks with short-dated put options. In the minutes after the release, BTC rose very modestly to just under $119,000.

A check of traditional markets finds U.S. stock index futures on the rise following the CPI, with the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 each ahead about 0.6%. The dollar has softened a bit and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dipped three basis points to 4.26%.

BitMine Immersion Technology (BMNR), the bitcoin miner that pivoted to an ether (ETH) treasury strategy under Fundstrat's Thomas Lee's leadership, is doubling down on its stock sale program, aiming to raise up to $20 billion more buy more ETH.

The company had previously authorized $4.5 billion in stock sales through agreements with Cantor Fitzgerald and ThinkEquity, and said it has already sold nearly all of that allotment, with just $723 left to sell.

BMNR's stock was up 4% pre-market.

Bitmine pursues a strategy to accumulate ETH and stake tokens for a yield, competing with rivals such as SharpLink Gaming (SBET) and others. The firm has accumulated almost $5 billion in ETH as of August 10 and ultimately aims to acquire 5% of the total ETH supply.

The firm also said on Monday that its stock was the 25th most traded among U.S.-listed companies, surpassing major stocks like JP Morgan and Micron in average daily trading volume. High trading volume allows to firm to sell shares to raise funds with less impact on the stock price.

This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

The bitcoin BTC$119,417.80 rally has stalled, raising the possibility of a potentially bearish technical formation: a double top.

A close examination of the daily chart reveals that bulls failed to sustain a rally above the key Fibonacci level of $122,056 on Monday, a performance that precisely mirrors a similar rejection on July 14, according to data source TradingView.

This dual failure to establish a foothold above the key price point, separated by a brief pullback, is a hallmark of the double top pattern. The neckline of this pattern, drawn from the low of $111,982 reached during the brief pullback, is the key level to watch on the downside.

A decisive move below that level would confirm the double top breakdown, potentially opening the door for a sell-off to $100,000. That level is arrived at by subtracting the gap between the twin peaks and the neckline from the neckline level in what's known as the measured move method of calculating targets.

Early this year, BTC double-topped near $100,000, eventually falling to lows under $75,000 in early April. The double top comprises two peaks separated by a trough and takes roughly two to six weeks to form. The gap between the two peaks must be equal to or less than 5%, with the spread between peaks and the trough being at least 10%, according to technical analysis theory.

These, however, are guidelines and not rules, meaning the backdrop is more important – the pattern should appear after a prolonged uptrend to be valid, which is the case with BTC.

The dual failure of Bitcoin bulls to sustain gains above $122,000 indicates a clear case of buyer exhaustion, giving bears a significant upper hand as the market heads into today's CPI release.

This exhaustion of buying pressure means the market is now particularly vulnerable to a hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation report due Tuesday. In other words, the buying momentum is not strong enough to absorb the potential selling pressure triggered by an elevated CPI and the resulting drop in the Fed rate cut bets. In this scenario, the market could experience a rapid decline.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Is $30 XRP price a real possibility for this bull cycle?","https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-30-xrp-price-realistic-in-this-bull-cycle","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 12:03:20 GMT","

 XRP prices have multiplied at least 10x in previous bull cycles, fueling hopes for a similar big breakout toward $30 by mid-2026. 

Key takeaways:

One market analyst projects XRP could climb toward $34 this bull cycle.

XRPL's $190 billion market cap versus $85 million TVL keeps overvaluation risks in play.

XRP (XRP) has rallied by more than 550% since November to over $3 on Tuesday. The cryptocurrency's sharp gains have prompted technical analyst Gert van Lagen to predict a broader uptrend toward $34 this bull cycle. 

Is it realistic for XRP to hit $30 and higher levels? Let's take a closer look.

XRP has broken out of a seven-year double-bottom structure after rising above its neckline near $1.80, according to Van Lagen. 

The cryptocurrency then pulled back to the neckline, which acted as support. In chart terms, such a retest often signals that the breakout is strong and traders are confident in higher prices.

Using the 2.00 Fibonacci extension of the pattern, Van Lagen's measured-move projection points to a $34 target by mid-2026.

The setup mirrors XRP's 2014–2017 price action, when a similar multi-year base resolved into a parabolic rally, pushing XRP/USD over 100,000% higher. 

XRP's markets have witnessed such outsized moves in recent years. For instance, it has gained 1,072% since the 2022 lows. Before that, in 2020-2021, XRP price soared by over 1,625%.

XRP's 2020–21 rally largely took cues from a near-zero interest rate environment in the US. Its 2022–25 gains were mainly fueled by progress in the Ripple lawsuit, growing legal clarity, exchange relistings and ETF optimism.

The latter continues to guide XRP bulls in 2025 with 95% odds of a spot ETF approval and forecasts suggesting the token could rally toward $27 if the green light comes, close to Van Lagen's target.

The growth of XRP's parent chain, XRP Ledger (XRPL), lags far behind other major layer 1s, including Ethereum, according to DefiLlama.

Its $190 billion market cap is roughly 2,200 times larger than its $85 million total-value-locked (TVL). That's a stark contrast to Ethereum's ratio of about 5.6, despite XRP's valuation being nearly 40% of the latter's. 

Such a disparity has led to concerns over XRP's extreme overvaluation relative to onchain activity.

As of August, over 95% of XRP's supply is in profit, a threshold that, during the 2020–21 and 2022–25 rallies, consistently preceded sharp price corrections, as shown in the Glassnode chart below.

When such a large share of holders sit on gains, profit-taking typically accelerates, creating sell pressure. Such a dynamic could challenge XRP's ability to sustain its current uptrend toward $30.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","New crypto whale buys $1.3B of Ether ahead of US inflation reports","https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-crypto-whale-buys-1-3b-ether-us-inflation","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 13:42:09 GMT","

 The new whale's investments came amid record-breaking Ether ETF inflows, which may help Ether recapture its old all-time high, market watchers told Cointelegraph. 

A new cryptocurrency whale has purchased $1.34 billion worth of Ether in the past eight days, outpacing record US spot Ether ETF inflows and fueling speculation over the token's price trajectory ahead of key US inflation data.  

The whale acquired 312,052 Ether (ETH) across 10 newly created cryptocurrency wallets, according to crypto intelligence platform Lookonchain.

The whale has acquired $300 million more than the record-breaking inflows to US spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which amassed $1 billion worth of Ether on Monday, their largest daily net inflows since launch.

Analysts say the billion-dollar accumulation could help push Ether closer to its previous all-time high of $4,890, still more than 12% above current levels. The surge in demand comes as investors await this week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports, which could shape expectations for the US Federal Reserve's Sept. 17 interest rate decision.

The CPI and PPI reports are “key” for shaping monetary policy expectations, as higher-than-expected inflation data may “weaken” investor appetite and “stall” the current crypto rally, according to Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, chief investment officer at crypto trading and asset management platform XBTO. “The rally fits within ETH's typical behaviour and could pause or consolidate without fresh catalysts.

“It's near-neutral Z-score (–0.06) shows that, despite the size of the move, it remains well within ETH's normal volatility range,” he said, adding that the continued corporate treasury buying may enable Ether to test its prior all-time high.

Markets are pricing in an 82% chance that the Fed will keep interest rates steady during the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Sept. 17, according to the latest estimates of the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

Still, Ether is seeing aggressive profit-taking from short-term Ether holders, signaling that this cohort may expect a pullback.

 Spot Ether ETFs had their biggest net inflow day ever on Monday, outpacing their Bitcoin counterparts amid ETH's recent rally. 

Spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded their biggest day of net inflows ever on Monday, with flows across all funds totalling $1.01 billion.

The development came as many key indicators had turned bullish and Ether (ETH) gained 45% in the past 30 days.

Inflows into Ether ETFs far exceeded those of their Bitcoin (BTC) counterparts, which saw a net inflow of $178 million on Monday, according to Farside Investors.

For the Ether funds, BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) attracted the lion's share of flows, with a record $640 million going into the fund.

The Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) was the runner-up and also recorded its largest single-day inflow, taking in $277 million.

NovaDius president Nate Geraci said on X that Ether ETFs were previously underestimated as institutional investors did not understand Ethereum.

“Feel like spot eth ETFs were severely underestimated simply [because] tradfi investors didn't understand eth,” Geraci said.

He added that institutional investors are now resonating with ETH, as it is being touted as the “backbone of future financial markets.”

The record inflows come as key indicators have turned bullish for ETH, which has surged 45% in the past 30 days, according to CoinGecko.

Ether held on exchanges hit a nine-year low on Thursday, dropping to 15.28 million ETH, its lowest level since November 2016, according to data from Glassnode.

Investors taking their crypto assets out of exchanges is typically considered a bullish signal, meaning they could be moving them for long-term storage.

In a Monday X post, onchain data platform Token Terminal noted that Ethereum remained the dominant chain for tokenized assets, as the blockchain accounted for about 58% of all tokenized assets across all chains.

The company also said that assets staked on the Ethereum network surpassed the $150 billion milestone for the first time.

Crypto influencer Anthony Sassano posted that Ether ETFs have bought over 50% of the ETH issued since the Merge in late 2022.The blockchain has issued over 451,000 ETH since its switch to proof-of-stake, while net inflows into the ETFs on Monday bought up 238,000 ETH, Sassano said.

“In a *single day*, the ETH ETFs bought over 50% all the net issued ETH since The Merge,” he said.

Corporate holders of Ether witnessed their assets under management swell to $13 billion on Monday due to the price increase of ETH.

The recent price rally has seen an uptick in short-term traders booking profits, suggesting short-term traders may be expecting ETH to pull back

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin warned on Thursday that the recent trend of corporations buying ETH for their treasuries could turn into a dangerous “overleveraged game.”

Cosmic Tornado from Star's Birth Whirls in Dazzling JWST Image

This telescope has revealed the whipped-up dust from the birth of a star—and a shining background galaxy—more clearly than ever before

When a star is born, the process leaves behind a flurry of high-energy gas, dust and debris. Some of this remnant material clumps together into planets, the way Earth likely formed. Others end up floating endlessly as meteors and space dust. But when conditions are just right, powerful plasma jets blasting out of a young star whip some of the debris into a giant, helical tower of steamy-looking cosmic dust—one of which we now can see better than ever before, thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

Astronomers had long been aware of these so-called Herbig-Haro objects—brilliant flares of ionized gas, often near newborn stars, that can be light-years long—including one named HH 49/50, whose characteristic shape led to its nickname of “cosmic tornado.” This object shines in the Chamaeleon I Cloud complex 625 light-years from Earth. Back in 2006, when HH 49/50 was first spotted by the now decommissioned Spitzer Space Telescope, astronomers could make out only an out-of-focus (albeit recognizably helical) lump of heated gas and dust with something shining at its tip. Although it was an exciting discovery at the time, the image's low resolution left the situation blurry.

Now, with the much bigger JWST, the full picture snaps into focus: the telescope captured this field of dust and debris just as a baby protostar (probably located somewhere on its lower right, outside the boundary of the image shown here) was blasting it into this very particular shape. The fuzzy blob at the top resolves into a distant spiral galaxy unrelated to the object itself. Its apparent position atop this ongoing event is just a quirk of our perspective.

This view, and the great distance, also creates a few other optical illusions, says Macarena Garcia Marin, an astrophysicist at the European Space Agency who was part of the team that took the new image. For example, the smaller dots appearing to float in front of the cosmic tornado aren't dust; they're actually entire galaxies shining through from behind it. The pointy dots are lone stars.

Still, the chance alignment of these cosmic entities lets scientists study a rich array of extraterrestrial phenomena, says Melissa McClure, an astronomer at Leiden University in the Netherlands who was not on the imaging team. Notably, we can see processes such as accretion in action, she says—“And the image is just gorgeous!”

Garcia Marin is particularly struck by the JWST picture's ephemeral nature, at least on cosmic scales. When the protostar eventually grows up, most likely beyond our lifetimes, the jets it produces and the accompanying cosmic tornado will fade, Garcia Marin says: “You're looking at a snapshot of a moment in the universe.”

New research, published in The Journal of Immunology, discovered that a parasitic worm suppresses neurons in the skin to evade detection. The researchers suggest that the worm likely evolved this mechanism to enhance its own survival, and that the discovery of the molecules responsible for the suppression could aid in the development of new painkillers.

Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by helminths, a type of worm. Infection occurs during contact with infested water through activities like swimming, washing clothes, and fishing, when larvae penetrate the skin. Surprisingly, the worm often evades detection by the immune system, unlike other bacteria or parasites that typically cause pain, itching, or rashes.

In this new study, researchers from Tulane School of Medicine aimed to find out why the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni doesn't cause pain or itching when it penetrates the skin. Their findings show that S. mansoni causes a reduction in the activity of TRPV1+, a protein that sends signals the brain interprets as heat, pain, or itching. As part of pain-sensing in sensory neurons, TRPV1+ regulates immune responses in many scenarios such as infection, allergy, cancer, autoimmunity, and even hair growth.

The researchers found that S. mansoni produces molecules that suppress TRPV1+ to block signals from being sent to the brain, allowing S. mansoni to infect the skin largely undetected. It is likely S. mansoni evolved the molecules that block TRPV1+ to enhance its survival.

""If we identify and isolate the molecules used by helminths to block TRPV1+ activation, it may present a novel alternative to current opioid-based treatments for reducing pain,"" said Dr. De'Broski R. Herbert, Professor of Immunology at Tulane School of Medicine, who led the study. ""The molecules that block TRPV1+ could also be developed into therapeutics that reduce disease severity for individuals suffering from painful inflammatory conditions.""

The study also found that TRPV1+ is necessary for initiating host protection against S. mansoni. TRPV1+ activation leads to the rapid mobilization of immune cells, including gd T cells, monocytes, and neutrophils, that induce inflammation. This inflammation plays a crucial role in host resistance to the larval entry into the skin. These findings highlight the importance of neurons that sense pain and itching in successful immune responses

""Identifying the molecules in S. mansoni that block TRPV1+ could inform preventive treatments for schistosomiasis. We envision a topical agent which activates TRPV1+ to prevent infection from contaminated water for individuals at risk of acquiring S. mansoni,"" said Dr. Herbert.

In this study, mice were infected with S. mansoi and evaluated for their sensitivity to pain as well as the role of TRPV1+ in preventing infection. Researchers next plan to identify the nature of the secreted or surface-associated helminth molecules that are responsible for blocking TRPV1+ activity and specific gd T cell subsets that are responsible for immune responses. The researchers also seek to further understand the neurons that helminths have evolved to suppress.

A new study from Flinders University has revealed why forgiving ourselves can be so difficult for some - even when we know it might benefit our mental health.

The research, published in the journal Self and Identity, looked at the real-life experiences of people who feel stuck in guilt and shame after making a mistake or going through a difficult situation.

The study explored why some people struggle to forgive themselves, comparing personal stories from 80 individuals who either did forgive themselves eventually with those who felt they never could.

The study found that people who struggled to forgive themselves often felt that the event was still fresh in their minds, even if it had happened years ago.

They described replaying the moment over and over, feeling stuck in the past, and struggling with intense emotions including guilt, regret, shame and self-blame.

Professor in Psychology and lead author, Professor Lydia Woodyatt, says the findings show that self-forgiveness is far more complex than simply ""letting go.""

""Self-forgiveness isn't about just moving on or forgetting what happened,"" says Professor Woodyatt, from the College of Education, Psychology and Social Work.

""People who forgave themselves still thought of the events from time to time, and still sometimes felt shame or guilt, especially if they were in a situation that reminded them of the event. The difference was, the emotions were much less intense and frequent, and the event no longer controlled their life.""

The group also made a conscious effort to focus on the future, accept their limitations (especially of knowledge, judgment, or control at the time), and reconnect with their values moving forward.

In contrast, the research showed that people who felt they had failed someone they cared for -- such as a child, partner, or friend -- or who had been victims themselves, often found it hardest to move on.

Professor Woodyatt says this challenges the idea that self-forgiveness is only for people who have clearly done something wrong.

""Sometimes self-condemnation, guilt and shame arise when wrong is done to us, or in situations where we feel a heightened sense of responsibility - even if there is no way we could control the outcome,"" she says.

""Emotions are a clue to what the brain needs to resolve in order to move on from self-condemnation. Emotions are the hurt that indicates the site of the possible injury if you will.

""In the case of shame, guilt and self-condemnation, this is about our brain helping to work through moral injury - that is core threats to psychological needs like agency (such as a sense of choice, control and autonomy) and our need for belonging (such as being an appropriate group member or relationship partner) and live according to those shared values.""

The study also found that self-forgiveness is not a one-time decision, but a process that takes time, reflection, and often support from others.

Professor Woodyatt says the findings are important for mental health professionals who work with people dealing with guilt and shame.

""Helping someone forgive themselves isn't about telling them - 'don't feel ashamed for this, it's not your fault',"" she says.

""It's about helping them understand where that shame or guilt is coming from, and working through those underlying psychological needs, moving from moral injury to moral repair - reaffirming their sense of agency and moral identity moving forward.""

Criminologist and psychologist Dr Melissa de Vel-Palumbo says the study offers valuable insights for criminologists by revealing how people process guilt and responsibility -- key factors in understanding offending behaviour and rehabilitation.

""In this research we drew on real stories from people reflecting on painful experiences, some going back decades,"" says Dr de Vel-Palumbo from Flinders' College of Business, Government and Law.

""That gave us a unique window into how people actually live with guilt, shame and self-blame over time.""

As the demand for plant-based meat and dairy options grows, vegan burgers, nuggets, and beverages have been in the spotlight for sustainable protein alternatives. But unlike their meatless burger counterparts, plant-based eggs haven't received the same attention from researchers -- until now.

Enter Da Eun Kim, a doctoral student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and Brenna Ellison, a professor at Purdue University. Together, they set out to answer a deceptively simple question: What makes someone willing to purchase a vegan egg?

Their new study is one of the first to examine this question. Using an experimental method known as a vignette design, researchers tested how factors such as price, product type, and setting influence people's behavior.

""We wanted to measure the consumer's perception about plant-based eggs,"" said Kim, who is a graduate student in the Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics, part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences at Illinois. ""A vignette experiment allowed us to create hypothetical scenarios and isolate what consumers really think.""

Instead of directly asking people if they would purchase a plant-based egg, the vignette method asked participants to imagine they were about to eat breakfast. This meal would take place either at home or in a restaurant, and consumers had a choice between scrambled eggs or pancakes made with plant-based eggs.

The results were both surprising and informative.

""We expected the setting to be more important, as we thought the novelty of the plant-based egg product would lead people to want to eat it in a restaurant where chefs know how to prepare the product in a way that tastes good,"" Ellison said. ""Surprisingly, the location of where you were eating, whether it be at a restaurant versus at home, didn't have as much of an effect as we imagined.""

Additionally, consumers were more likely to purchase plant-based eggs when they were mixed into something familiar, like pancakes, instead of served on their own.

The team also asked participants to rate how plant-based eggs would compare to traditional ones. Unsurprisingly, expected taste and appearance still favor the classic egg. But the plant-based version came out on top for environmental impact and animal welfare. This reflects a broader trend in food science, where ethical motivations are beginning to influence consumer choices.

Does this mean every consumer will want to purchase plant-based eggs? ""Probably not,"" Ellison said. ""However, we did find that consumers who had previous experience trying plant-based eggs were more likely to purchase them compared to people without that experience. This suggests that consumers had a positive experience with the product previously.""

While familiarity with plant-based eggs is helpful, familiarity with the end product, such as pancakes, may also be key. ""Introducing them as an ingredient, especially in a product that consumers are comfortable with, is a way to get people over any 'mental hurdles' associated with trying plant-based eggs,"" Ellison said.

These results offer a clear message for the industry: give people an easy, tasty, and recognizable way to try something new.

""There are still sensory barriers,"" Kim said. ""I've tried the liquid version that comes in a bottle, like egg whites. The taste was different, but I was surprised the texture was very similar to traditional eggs.""

That firsthand experience echoes the study's findings; while taste and texture still matter, many consumers just need a nudge to take the first bite. And the best way to do that may be through a subtle swap in a familiar dish.

While plant-based eggs might not be ready to replace the classic scramble at every breakfast table, they are finding their niche. Science shows that people may not be ready to eat them plain -- but mix them in, make it easy, and meet consumers where they are.

The human brain ages less than thought and in layers - at least in the area of the cerebral cortex responsible for the sense of touch. Researchers at DZNE, the University of Magdeburg, and the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research at the University of Tübingen come to this conclusion based on brain scans of young and older adults in addition to studies in mice. Their findings, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, also provide new insights into how the ability to process sensory information changes with age.

The human cerebral cortex is only a few millimeters thick and arranged in numerous folds. This tissue usually becomes thinner with age. ""This is a hallmark of aging. It is attributed, among other things, to the loss of neurons. As a result, some abilities deteriorate. In any case, it is generally assumed that less brain volume means reduced function,"" explains Prof. Esther Kühn, a neuroscientist at DZNE and the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research. ""However, little is known about how exactly the cortex actually ages. This is remarkable, given that many of our daily activities depend on a functioning cortex. That's why we examined the situation with high-resolution brain scans.""

A processor for tactile input

Together with colleagues from Tübingen and Magdeburg, Esther Kühn focused on a part of the cerebral cortex where signals from the tactile sense are processed. This ""primary somatosensory cortex"" is located on the left and right side of the top of the head and extends along a strip about a finger's width wide towards each ear. ""This brain area is relevant for the perception of one's own body and for interacting with the environment,"" explains the neuroscientist. ""When I pick up a key, grasp a door handle or even walk, I constantly need haptic feedback to control my movements. The corresponding stimuli converge in this area and are also processed here.""

An unexpected finding

Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the researchers were able to map this area of the cerebral cortex with unprecedented accuracy. To do this, they employed a particularly sensitive scanner with a magnetic field strength of seven Tesla, enabling them to image minute brain structures about the size of a grain of sand. A total of around 60 women and men between the ages of 21 and 80 were examined. ""Until now, it had not been considered that the primary somatosensory cortex consists of a stack of several extremely thin layers of tissue, each with its own architecture and function. We have now found that these layers age differently. Although the cerebral cortex becomes thinner overall, some of its layers remain stable or, surprisingly, are even thicker with age. Presumably because they are particularly solicited and thus retain their functionality. We therefore see evidence for neuroplasticity, that is, adaptability, even in senior people.""

Stacked architecture

The layered structure of the primary somatosensory cortex also occurs in similar form in other areas of the human brain - and even in other organisms. ""From an evolutionary perspective, processing sensory information in this way has apparently proven beneficial,"" says Kühn. In the current study, not only the middle layer of the cortex but also the areas above were found to be remarkably resistant to the aging process. The different layers were distinguished based on their content of myelin, a substance essential for the transmission of nerve signals. ""The middle layer is effectively the gateway for haptic stimuli. In the layers above, further processing occurs,"" says Kühn. ""For example, in the case of sensory stimuli from the hand, the upper layers are particularly involved in the interaction between neighboring fingers. This is important when grasping objects. We therefore also did tests on the tactile sensitivity and motor ability of the hand with our study participants. Furthermore, we performed so-called functional MRI scans to capture the function of the middle layer of the cortex, where the signals are received.""

Modulated stimuli

Only the deeper layers of the cerebral cortex showed age-related degeneration: they were thinner in older study participants than in younger ones. In the lower layers of the cortex, a process called modulation takes place: tactile signals are amplified or attenuated depending on the context. ""This has something to do with concentration and attention,"" explains Kühn. ""For example, if I'm wearing a ring on my finger, at some point I'll stop feeling it, even though the tactile stimuli are still there. This only reoccurs when I consciously notice the ring again.""

What is used is preserved

""The middle and upper layers of the cortex are most directly exposed to external stimuli. They are permanently active because we have constant contact with our environment,"" Kühn continues. ""The neural circuits in the lower layers are stimulated to a lesser extent, especially in later life. I therefore see our findings as an indication that the brain preserves what is used intensively. That's a feature of neuroplasticity. This is also consistent with our observations regarding a study participant, who was 52 years old. He had to rely on just one arm throughout his life, as he was born with a missing limb. The corresponding middle layer of his cerebral cortex, the one getting sensory inputs, was comparatively thin."" In addition, differences in the aging of the brain's layers may explain why some abilities decline with age, while others do less. ""Sensorimotor skills that are repeatedly practiced, such as typing on a keyboard, can remain stable for a long time, even in old age,"" says Kühn. ""However, if there are interfering stimuli, such as a noisy environment, older people usually find such activities particularly difficult. This could be because the functionality of the deep layers of the cortex has deteriorated, the modulation of sensory stimuli thus being impaired.""

Evidence for compensation

However, the researchers found evidence that mechanisms in the deep layers of the cerebral cortex counteract age-related functional decline to some extent. ""Although the deep layers became thinner with age, their myelin content, surprisingly, increased. In fact, we also observed these effects in studies on mice, which we did for comparison. We then found that the rise in myelin is due to an increase in the number of certain neurons,"" says Kühn. ""These are known to have a positive effect on the modulation of nerve impulses. They sharpen the signal, so to speak. Apparently, compensatory mechanisms counteract specific cellular degeneration. With regard to prevention, it would be interesting to study whether these mechanisms can be specifically promoted and maintained. In fact, our data from mice suggests that this compensation disappears at a very advanced age.""

An optimistic view on aging

""Together, our findings are consistent with the general idea that we can do something good for our brains with appropriate stimulation. I think it's an optimistic notion that we can influence our aging process to a certain degree,"" says Kühn. ""But of course, everyone has to find their own way to tap into this potential.""

With over 75% of professionals using AI in their daily work, writing and editing messages with tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot or Claude has become a commonplace practice. While generative AI tools are seen to make writing easier, are they effective for communicating between managers and employees?

A new study of 1,100 professionals reveals a critical paradox in workplace communications: AI tools can make managers' emails more professional, but regular use can undermine trust between them and their employees.

""We see a tension between perceptions of message quality and perceptions of the sender,"" said Anthony Coman, Ph.D., a researcher at the University of Florida's Warrington College of Business and study co-author. ""Despite positive impressions of professionalism in AI-assisted writing, managers who use AI for routine communication tasks put their trustworthiness at risk when using medium- to high-levels of AI assistance.""

In the study published in the International Journal of Business Communication, Coman and his co-author, Peter Cardon, Ph.D., of the University of Southern California, surveyed professionals about how they viewed emails that they were told were written with low, medium and high AI assistance. Survey participants were asked to evaluate different AI-written versions of a congratulatory message on both their perception of the message content and their perception of the sender.

While AI-assisted writing was generally seen as efficient, effective, and professional, Coman and Cardon found a ""perception gap"" in messages that were written by managers versus those written by employees.

""When people evaluate their own use of AI, they tend to rate their use similarly across low, medium and high levels of assistance,"" Coman explained. ""However, when rating other's use, magnitude becomes important. Overall, professionals view their own AI use leniently, yet they are more skeptical of the same levels of assistance when used by supervisors.""

While low levels of AI help, like grammar or editing, were generally acceptable, higher levels of assistance triggered negative perceptions. The perception gap is especially significant when employees perceive higher levels of AI writing, bringing into question the authorship, integrity, caring and competency of their manager.

The impact on trust was substantial: Only 40% to 52% of employees viewed supervisors as sincere when they used high levels of AI, compared to 83% for low-assistance messages. Similarly, while 95% found low-AI supervisor messages professional, this dropped to 69-73% when supervisors relied heavily on AI tools.

The findings reveal employees can often detect AI-generated content and interpret its use as laziness or lack of caring. When supervisors rely heavily on AI for messages like team congratulations or motivational communications, employees perceive them as less sincere and question their leadership abilities.

""In some cases, AI-assisted writing can undermine perceptions of traits linked to a supervisor's trustworthiness,"" Coman noted, specifically citing impacts on perceived ability and integrity, both key components of cognitive-based trust.

The study suggests managers should carefully consider message type, level of AI assistance and relational context before using AI in their writing. While AI may be appropriate and professionally received for informational or routine communications, like meeting reminders or factual announcements, relationship-oriented messages requiring empathy, praise, congratulations, motivation or personal feedback are better handled with minimal technological intervention.

Researchers from the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), part of City of Hope, and the Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center have identified a potential biomarker for long COVID.

If the findings of their study are confirmed by other research centers, the biomarker could be the first specific and quantifiable indicator for confirming long COVID. Currently, clinicians confer a diagnosis of long COVID based upon a collection of symptoms that patients develop after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

""If a patient arrives in clinic and they relate the persistence of typical signs and symptoms of long COVID, 12 weeks or more after COVID -19 infection, I give them a presumptive diagnosis, but I don't have any blood tests or biomarkers to confirm this diagnosis,"" said William Stringer, M.D., a Lundquist Institute investigator and senior author on the study.

The study results, reported in the journal Infection, detail the detection of SARS-CoV-2 protein fragments within extracellular vesicles (EVs) -- tiny, naturally occurring packages that help cells share proteins, metabolites, and other materials. The researchers collected and analyzed blood samples from 14 patients over 12 weeks of aerobic exercise training (56 samples in all) in a clinical trial led by Stringer in long COVID.

The researchers found 65 distinct protein fragments from SARS-CoV-2 inside the EVs. These fragments come from the virus's Pp1ab protein, an RNA Replicase enzyme which is key to how the virus copies itself and makes other viral particles. This protein is found uniquely in SARS-CoV-2, and not in uninfected human cells, noted Asghar Abbasi, Ph.D., a Lundquist Institute investigator and first author of the study.

Significantly, the researchers found that these viral peptides were demonstrated in each subject, but not each blood draw, in the EVs of Long COVID patients and were not detected in a separate control group of pre-pandemic EV samples.

These findings add to growing evidence that suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may persist in certain body tissues long after the initial infection. Some groups hypothesize these lingering viral reservoirs could play a role in Long COVID. How the virus reaches tissues without its usual entry points -- such as the brain -- remains an open question, and may be related to EV particles.

""We thought that maybe if the virus is circulating or moving in the body, we should try to see if EVs are carrying those viral fragments,"" Abbasi explained.

This idea became part of an ongoing clinical trial led by Drs. Abbasi and Stringer, which was already studying EVs to see if they are linked to changes in immune function related to exercise and post-exertional malaise, a common symptom in these patients.

""While promising, the molecular signal of the viral peptides within the study samples was observed to be subtle and not consistently detected at every blood collection time point,"" said Patrick Pirrotte, Ph.D., associate professor at TGen, director of the Integrated Mass Spectrometry Shared Resource at TGen and City of Hope, and co-senior author of the study. ""There's still a lot to unpack that we don't know at this point.""

For instance, he added, the researchers don't know if the exercise itself drives the expression of viral programs intracellularly, and then those viral programs result in proteins that are going to be shed, or if there is a permanent reservoir in those cells, and it's just a matter of detecting it at a certain time point. Although the identified peptides originated from one of the virus' largest proteins, the researchers did not detect other comparably large proteins indicative of active viral replication. It's possible that the peptides contained in the EVs are just molecular ""trash"" leftover after the formation of new viral proteins.

""We haven't run [our tests] on people without long COVID symptoms who are currently, or who were, infected with COVID,"" said Stringer. ""This raises the question: is this just continuing to take out the trash from the COVID infected cell or is this really ongoing replication someplace? I think that's the mechanistic issue that needs to be resolved in future studies.""

Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest threats facing humanity, making the need for new antibiotics more critical than ever. While most antibiotics originate from bacteria and fungi, archaea offer a largely untapped reservoir for antibiotic discovery. In this study, we leveraged deep learning to systematically explore the archaeome, uncovering promising candidates for combating antimicrobial resistance. By mining 233 archaeal proteomes, we identified 12,623 molecules with potential antimicrobial activity. These peptide compounds, termed archaeasins, have unique compositional features that differentiate them from traditional antimicrobial peptides, including a distinct amino acid profile. We synthesized 80 archaeasins, 93% of which showed antimicrobial activity in vitro against Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. Notably, in vivo validation identified archaeasin-73 as a lead candidate, significantly reducing A. baumannii loads in mouse infection models, with effectiveness comparable to that of established antibiotics such as polymyxin B. Our findings highlight the potential of archaea as a resource for developing next-generation antibiotics.

The rise of antimicrobial resistance is one of the most urgent global health threats, as resistant pathogens undermine the efficacy of existing antibiotics, leading to increasingly difficult-to-treat infections. This growing crisis highlights the critical need for new antibiotics1. However, the discovery pipeline for antibiotics has slowed substantially in recent decades1,2, and has traditionally relied primarily on bacteria and fungi as sources. Recently, computational approaches3,4,5,6,7, particularly deep learning models, have provided new avenues for antibiotic discovery by enabling the systematic exploration of vast sequence spaces.

Despite their evolutionary significance and biochemical diversity, archaea remain an underexplored domain for antibiotic discovery. Unlike bacteria and eukaryotes, archaea possess unique lipid membranes, metabolic pathways and stress-adaptation mechanisms that may influence the structure and function of their encrypted peptides (EPs). EPs have emerged as an exciting new frontier in antibiotic discovery due to their unique structural and functional properties. These peptides are often overlooked in conventional sequence-based searches but can show broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity when properly identified and tested. Previous studies have shown that EPs derived from human4,7, bacterial3,8 and even extinct organisms5,6 proteomes can serve as effective antimicrobial agents, yet no systematic investigation has explored the archaeome for such bioactive sequences. Given their evolutionary divergence from bacteria and eukaryotes, archaeal EPs may have structural and mechanistic properties that differentiate them from known antimicrobial agents.

In this study, we applied APEX 1.1, an updated version of our previously developed deep learning framework, APEX6, to systematically mine all archaeal proteomes curated from the Swiss-Prot9 subset of UniProt10. This approach enabled the identification of EPs with predicted antimicrobial activity, herein referred to as archaeasins (Extended Data Fig. 1). By leveraging a computational pipeline trained on known antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and EP sequences, we identified 12,623 putative AMPs from 233 archaeal proteomes. Of these, we synthesized and experimentally tested 80 archaeasins, with 93% showing antimicrobial activity in vitro. Furthermore, we validated the efficacy of archaeasin-73 in preclinical murine infection models, where it showed antimicrobial effects comparable to those of polymyxin B.

By expanding the search for encrypted AMPs into the archaeome, this work highlights the untapped potential of this domain of life and underscores the power of integrating deep learning with experimental validation to accelerate antibiotic discovery. Our findings provide a large-scale demonstration that archaea encode a vast repertoire of peptides with promising therapeutic potential.

We collected 18,677 non-redundant reviewed protein sequences from 233 archaeal organisms available on UniProt10 and used APEX 1.1, a deep learning antimicrobial activity predictor6 retrained on updated data (‘APEX 1.1' in Methods), to mine EPs within archaeal proteomes. As APEX predicted bacterial-strain-specific minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), we used the mean MIC to represent the overall antimicrobial potency of the peptides and found 12,623 EPs with a mean MIC ≤100 μmol l−1 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Data 1), representing an archaeasin ratio of 0.00653% from the 193,331,608 archaeal peptides scanned. To assess whether this signal exceeded random expectations, we generated a non-redundant set of 193,288,387 randomly sampled peptides with a length distribution matching that of the archaeasins. Applying the same AMP criterion (mean MIC ≤ 100 μmol l−1), we identified 5,292 predicted active peptides from the random set, corresponding to an AMP rate of 0.00274%, or roughly 2.38× lower than that observed in archaeal EPs. These findings suggest that antimicrobial sequences are statistically enriched in archaeal proteomes relative to random sampling.

a, Archaeal proteomes were systematically scanned to identify EPs with potential antimicrobial activity. Circular bars denote the log10-transformed average active (red) and inactive (blue) EPs discovered by APEX. A peptide was classified as active if its predicted mean MIC against tested bacterial strains was ≤100 μmol l−1. The values were normalized by the number of proteins per organism scanned. Archaea with peptides that were synthesized are indicated by a light red square, and those experimentally validated as active are highlighted with a dark red square. b, Sequence space exploration using a similarity matrix. The graph illustrates a bidimensional sequence space visualization of peptide sequences found in DBAASP and antimicrobial EPs discovered by APEX in archaea organisms. Sequence alignment was used to generate a similarity matrix for all peptide sequences in DBAASP and the 12,623 antimicrobial EPs predicted by APEX (Supplementary Data 1 and 2). Each row in the matrix represents a feature representation of a peptide based on its amino acid composition. UMAP was applied to reduce the feature representation to two dimensions for visualization (Extended Data Fig. 2a). c, Comparison of amino acid frequency in archaeal EPs with known AMPs from the DBAASP, APD3 and DRAMP 3.0 databases (Extended Data Fig. 2b–e). d,e, Distribution of two physico-chemical properties for peptides with predicted antimicrobial activity, compared with AMPs from DBAASP, APD3 and DRAMP 3.0: net charge (d) and normalized hydrophobicity (e). Net charge influences the initial electrostatic interactions between the peptide and negatively charged bacterial membranes, whereas hydrophobicity affects interactions with lipids in the membrane bilayers (Extended Data Fig. 2). The Chi-squared test of independence of variables in a contingency table was used to compare the amino acid composition in c; P values were 0, that is, below machine precision levels, suggesting that they are statistically significant. Statistical significance in d and e was determined using two-tailed t-tests followed by a Mann–Whitney test; P < 0.0001. The solid line inside each box represents the mean value for each group.

We next examined whether archaeal species with larger genomes tend to encode a greater number of predicted AMPs. To do this, we compiled the number of predicted active EPs (defined as peptides with a mean MIC ≤100 μmol l−1 across 11 pathogen strains) and the total number of protein-coding genes, based on National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) annotations, for the 10 archaeal genera with the highest and lowest EP counts. This dataset enabled us to assess potential relationships between genomic content and AMP abundance (Supplementary Table 1). A Spearman correlation analysis revealed a statistically significant positive correlation between genome size and the number of predicted EPs (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (ρ) = 0.4475, P = 0.0479), suggesting that archaeal species with larger genomes may harbour a broader repertoire of latent antimicrobial sequences.

Interestingly, several of the top-scoring genera, such as Pyrococcus, Methanocaldococcus, Pyrobaculum and Sulfolobus, are known thermophiles. This observation raises the possibility that certain lifestyle traits, such as adaptation to high-temperature environments, may be associated with greater bioactive peptide abundance. Although this analysis focused primarily on genome size, we acknowledge that environmental factors such as temperature tolerance, metabolic specialization or ecological niche may also influence the diversity and prevalence of encrypted AMPs. However, we consider this a preliminary analysis and expect that, as more archaeal genomes are catalogued and annotated, the observed trends will become more robust and enable more detailed exploration of ecological and evolutionary correlates of active peptide abundance.

To investigate the distribution of AMP-like EPs within the archaeal proteomes, we first performed sequence alignment on the combined set of 12,623 EPs and 19,775 publicly available AMPs from DBAASP11, APD3 (ref. 12) and DRAMP13 (see ‘APEX 1.1' in Methods). We then applied uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)14 to reduce and visualize the sequence similarity matrix derived from the local sequence alignment (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2a).

Focusing on the top 265 archaeasins (mean MIC < 80 μmol l−1; Supplementary Data 2) that are sequentially diverse (see ‘Archaeasin selection' in Methods), we analysed their source proteins by retrieving Gene Ontology annotations (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Gene Ontology term frequencies revealed that many of these top-ranking archaeasins originated from cytoplasmic proteins and proteins with essential cellular functions, including ATP binding, metal-ion binding, DNA binding, tRNA binding and zinc-ion binding. Several archaeasins were also derived from structural ribosomal proteins, plasma membrane proteins and proteins involved in translation. Collectively, these findings highlight the broad distribution and functional diversity of archaeasins throughout archaeal cells.

The amino acid composition of archaeasins revealed distinctive features compared with known AMPs from databases (Fig. 1c) and EPs previously discovered in the human proteome using APEX6 and a complementary scoring function4,7 (Extended Data Fig. 2c–f). Archaeasins were notably enriched in glutamic acid residues, surpassing levels typically found in known AMPs. This higher prevalence of negatively charged residues is also observed when comparing archaeasins with other EPs from human proteins. Nonetheless, archaeasins maintain a prevalence of cationic residues, leading them to display a slightly higher proportion of cationic residues compared with database entries, suggesting a unique balance in charge distribution (Fig. 1d). Despite these differences, their hydrophobicity remains comparable to standard database sequences (Fig. 1e). In addition, archaeasins show a tendency towards increased amphiphilicity, indicating a balanced distribution between hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2). This analysis supports the notion that archaea, like humans7, encode a rich and compositionally unique repertoire of antimicrobial EPs, highlighting their potential as an unusual source of antibiotics and providing an evolutionary contrast that aids in deciphering antimicrobial diversity across domains of life.

To experimentally validate the antimicrobial activity of the archaea EPs, we selected 80 peptides that were both sequentially diverse (<70% sequence similarity with each other) and top ranked by APEX 1.1 (Supplementary Data 2). We prioritized peptides with less than <70% sequence similarity to known AMP sequences for chemical synthesis and experimental validation (Extended Data Fig. 2a). In addition, when two mined sequences showed high sequence similarity, we retained only the peptide with the higher predicted antimicrobial activity (see ‘Archaeasin selection' in Methods).

These archaeasins were tested against clinically relevant pathogens (Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium) at a range of concentrations from 1 μmol l−1 to 64 μmol l−1. The results showed that 75 of the 80 EPs showed antimicrobial activity (MIC ≤ 64 μmol l−1) against at least 1 pathogenic strain (Fig. 2a), resulting in a hit rate of over 93%. Polymyxin B and levofloxacin were used as positive controls (Extended Data Fig. 4a). In addition, the Pearson correlation (r = 0.503) between predicted and experimentally validated MICs showed the predictive power of APEX 1.1 (Extended Data Fig. 4b). When comparing the Pearson and Spearman correlations between experimental and predicted MICs from the first version of APEX6 to APEX 1.1 (used to explore the archaeome) on the 80 archaeasins synthesized, we observed that APEX 1.1 significantly outperformed APEX (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).

Briefly, 105 bacterial cells were incubated with serially diluted EPs (0–64 μmol l−1) at 37 °C. Bacterial growth was assessed by measuring the optical density at 600 nm in a microplate reader at 1 day post-treatment. The MIC values presented in the heat map represent the mode of the replicates for each condition, and the antibiotics polymyxin B and levofloxacin were used as positive controls (Extended Data Fig. 4a). b−d, Ternary plots showing the percentage of secondary structure for each peptide (at 50 μmol l−1) in 3 different solvents: water (b), 60% TFE in water (c), and SDS (10 mmol l−1) in water (d). Secondary structure fractions were calculated using the BeStSel server18. fH and fβ stand for helical and β fractions, respectively. Red dots indicate active archaeasins and blue dots represent inactive peptides (Extended Data Fig. 5).

Source data

The secondary structure of short peptides is often dynamic, transitioning between disordered and ordered conformations at hydrophobic–hydrophilic interfaces. These structural transitions are critical in determining the antimicrobial and other biological functions of peptides. To assess the secondary structure of the synthesized archaeasins, we conducted circular dichroism experiments in various environments: water, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in water (10 mmol l−1), and a mixture of trifluoroethanol (TFE) in water (3:2, v/v). SDS micelles were chosen as a membrane-mimetic environment because of the lipid bilayer environment that is similar to biological bilayers15. The TFE–water mixture is known to induce α-helical structures by dehydrating the amide groups in the peptide backbone, thus favouring intramolecular hydrogen bonds that promote a helical conformation16,17. All archaeasins were tested at 50 μmol l−1 in the wavelength range of 190–260 nm (Extended Data Fig. 5). To determine secondary conformation fractions, we used the Beta Structure Selection (BeStSel) server18 (Fig. 2b–d). As expected, given that archaeasins are short sequences (<50 amino acid residues), all tested peptides were unstructured in water (Fig. 2b), with a slight tendency towards β-like structures (20% < fβ (β fraction)< 45%) in the other 2 analysed media, the helical-inducer TFE and water mixture (3:2, v/v; Fig. 2c) and SDS micelles (10 mmol l−1) in water (Fig. 2d). This behaviour is typical for short peptides showing antimicrobial activity19,20,21. Whereas EPs primarily adopt β-like structures3,8, archaeasins showed helical conformations in helical-inducing media and upon interaction with lipid bilayers.

To explore whether molecules from the same archaeal strains or their closest relatives could synergize and potentiate each other's antimicrobial activity against pathogens, we performed checkerboard assays. Checkerboard assays are a standard method used to evaluate the interaction between two antimicrobial agents by testing their combined effects over a range of concentrations. This approach allows for the determination of whether a combination exhibits synergy, additivity, indifference or antagonism, providing a quantitative assessment of potential cooperative activity22. These assays tested peptide concentrations ranging from 2× the MIC to concentrations up to 32× lower, under the same conditions as those used for the antimicrobial assays. We initially selected the bacterial strain A. baumannii American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 19606, known for its high antibiotic resistance and significant role as an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen with substantial global mortality rates23. This strain was particularly susceptible to the archaeasins. We then selected peptides from strains closely related on the phylogenetic tree (pairwise distance ≤8), resulting in the testing of 79 pairs of archaeasins (Fig. 3).

The synergistic interactions between pairs of EPs from the same or closely related organisms (phylogenetic pairwise distance ≤8) that showed activity against A. baumannii ATCC 19606 were assessed using checkerboard assays. These assays involved twofold serial dilutions, ranging from 2× MIC to a 1:32 dilution. The histogram shows the FICI values obtained for each pair of EPs. A total of 79 pairs were evaluated. Low FICI values (≤0.5) indicate synergistic interactions, intermediate values (0.5 < FICI ≤ 1) indicate additive effects and higher values (1 < FICI ≤ 2) indicate indifferent interactions. Numbers 1–15 indicate where each pair or group of pairs originates within the archaeal phylogenetic tree.

Source data

Most of the combinations tested showed synergistic or additive interactions, as determined by the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI)24. The FICI is commonly classified as follows: FICI ≤ 0.5 indicates strong synergy, 0.5 < FICI ≤ 1 suggests an additive effect, 1 < FICI ≤ 2 implies no interaction (indifference) and FICI > 2 denotes antagonism between the compounds. Lower FICI values indicate a stronger interaction, where the combined effect of the peptides enhances antimicrobial efficacy beyond their individual activities. Synergistic interactions are particularly significant in antimicrobial research, as they allow for lower individual drug concentrations while maintaining or enhancing efficacy. This can reduce potential toxicity, slow resistance development and improve treatment outcomes. By leveraging synergy, it may be possible to develop combination therapies that enhance the effectiveness of existing antimicrobial agents. Notably, archaeasins from Methanocaldococcus species showed some of the lowest FICI values, ranging from 0.25 (archaeasin-25 and archaeasin-27) to 0.375 (archaeasin-21 and archaeasin-27, archaeasin-21 and archaeasin-28, and archaeasin-24 and archaeasin-28). Similarly, Methanothermobacter species compounds showed FICI values from 0.28 (archaeasin-46 and archaeasin-48) to 0.375 (archaeasin-45 and archaeasin-46, and archaeasin-46 and archaeasin-48). Thermococcus species had a FICI of 0.28 (archaeasin-75 and archaeasin-76), while compounds derived from Pyrococcus species had a FICI of 0.375 for combinations of archaeasin-60 and archaeasin-64, archaeasin-60 and archaeasin-65, archaeasin-61 and archaeasin-65, and archaeasin-63 and archaeasin-64.

Interestingly, our analysis revealed that certain archaeal lineages appear to be more prone to producing synergistic peptides. Peptides from hyperthermophilic archaea, particularly those from Methanocaldococcus and Thermococcus species, showed the most consistent synergistic interactions. This observation suggests that organisms adapted to extreme environments may have evolved antimicrobial strategies that rely on cooperative mechanisms, possibly to counteract competitive microbial communities. The tendency of peptides from these lineages to show synergy could be due to their structural adaptations, enhanced stability under extreme conditions or specific physico-chemical properties that facilitate cooperative activity. Further exploration of these evolutionary trends may provide deeper insights into the origins of antimicrobial synergy and guide the design of therapeutic peptide combinations.

These findings highlight the potential for archaeasin-based combinatorial therapies to provide alternatives for antimicrobial development, particularly in addressing multidrug-resistant infections.

To understand how archaeasins exert their effect on bacterial cells, we conducted fluorescence assays to determine if their mechanism of action involves membrane targeting. First, we identified 70 antimicrobial hits among archaeasins effective against A. baumannii ATCC 19606 (Fig. 2a). We then assessed the ability of these peptides, at their MIC values, to permeabilize (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 6a) and depolarize (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 6b) bacterial outer and cytoplasmic membranes, respectively.

To assess whether archaea EPs act on bacterial membranes, all active peptides against A. baumannii ATCC 19606 were subjected to outer membrane permeabilization and cytoplasmic membrane depolarization assays. a,b, Here we show the two lead permeabilizer and depolarizer archaeasins (see Extended Data Fig. 6 for permeabilization and depolarization results of all archaeasins). The fluorescence probe NPN was used to assess membrane permeabilization (a) induced by the tested EPs (Extended Data Fig. 6a). The fluorescence probe DiSC3-5 was used to evaluate membrane depolarization (b) caused by archaeasins (Extended Data Fig. 6b). The shown values represent the relative fluorescence of both probes, with nonlinear fitting compared with the baseline of the untreated control (buffer + bacteria + fluorescence dye) and benchmarked against the antibiotics polymyxin B and levofloxacin. c, Laurdan generalized polarization over time in A. baumannii treated with archaeasins. Generalized polarization values were measured to assess changes in the lipid packing (membrane order) of the cytoplasmic membrane following treatment with the archaeasins that showed greater permeabilization of the outer membrane, archaeasin-21 and archaeasin-22, and greater depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane, archaeasin-57, and archaeasin-78. Higher generalized polarization values indicate increased membrane rigidity, whereas lower values reflect increased membrane fluidity. Benzyl alcohol was used as a positive control for membrane fluidization, and untreated cells served as a negative control. Data represent a linear regression of the mean of 3 independent experiments over 30 min. d, Haemolytic and cytotoxic concentrations, against RBCs and HEK293T cells, respectively, leading to 50% cell lysis (HC50 and CC50, respectively) were determined by interpolating the dose-response data using a nonlinear regression curve. All experiments were performed in three independent replicates (Extended Data Fig. 7). The protein and peptide structures depicted in panels a and b were created with PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, v.3.0 (Schrödinger).

To evaluate the ability of archaeasins to permeabilize the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, we used N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN) assays. NPN is a lipophilic dye that fluoresces in lipid-rich environments, such as bacterial outer membranes. Damage to the bacterial outer membrane allows NPN to penetrate, increasing fluorescence (Fig. 4a). Only archaeasin-21 (parent protein, uncharacterized protein MJ1489.1) and archaeasin-22 (parent protein, putative flagella-related protein D) from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii effectively permeabilized the bacterial outer membrane. Polymyxin B served as a positive control in these experiments4. Overall, archaeasins did not permeabilize the bacterial outer membrane to the extent observed for AMPs25,26 or other human- or animal-derived EPs4,6.

We then used 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (DiSC3-5), a fluorophore that indicates cytoplasmic membrane depolarization. Disruption of the transmembrane potential causes the fluorophore to migrate to the extracellular space, resulting in increased fluorescence. Among the 70 peptides tested, 34 archaeasins significantly depolarized the cytoplasmic membrane more than the control group treated with polymyxin B4 (Fig. 4b). Archaeasin-78 (parent protein, alanine tRNA ligase) from Thermofilum pendens and archaeasin-57 (parent protein, small ribosomal subunit protein uS4) from Pyrobaculum arsenaticum were particularly effective depolarizers.

Laurdan generalized polarization assays further supported this membrane-targeting mechanism by revealing changes in the physical state of the A. baumannii cytoplasmic membrane upon archaeasin treatment (Fig. 4c). Laurdan fluorescence shifts reflect alterations in membrane lipid packing, where increased generalized polarization values indicate membrane rigidification. Consistent with the cytoplasmic membrane depolarization data, archaeasin-78 and archaeasin-57 caused pronounced increases in generalized polarization values over time, suggesting that these peptides not only disrupt membrane potential but also directly perturb membrane lipid organization. In contrast, archaeasin-21 and archaeasin-22, which were effective at permeabilizing the outer membrane, induced only modest or even decreasing generalized polarization shifts, indicating minimal impact on the cytoplasmic membrane's physical state. These differences in Laurdan response correlate with each peptide's structural features and probable depth of membrane insertion, reinforcing the conclusion that cytoplasmic membrane interaction, rather than outer membrane permeabilization, is the dominant antimicrobial mechanism for most archaeasins.

These findings suggest that archaeasins primarily exert their antimicrobial effects by depolarizing the cytoplasmic membrane, rather than permeabilizing the outer membrane. This suggests a mechanism akin to that of the recently reported small open-reading-frame-encoded peptides8 and unusual for conventional AMPs25,26 and EPs4, which typically target the outer membrane19.

To assess the potential toxicity of the synthesized archaeasins, we exposed them to human red blood cells (RBCs), a common method for evaluating the toxicity of antimicrobial agents20,26,27. Of the 80 archaeasins tested, 25 (31.3%) showed moderate to low haemolytic activity within the explored concentration range, that is, their HC50 values (linear regression of the peptide concentration that leads to 50% RBC lysis) were ≤64 μmol l−1 (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 7). Most sequences active against bacterial pathogens at low MIC values did not display toxic effects at those concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 7). However, 7 archaeasins, specifically archaeasin-12, archaeasin-13, archaeasin-32, archaeasin-54, archaeasin-58, archaeasin-64 and archaeasin-78, did show haemolytic effects.

To further evaluate the safety profile of the archaeasins, we assessed their cytotoxic activity against human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells. The CC50 values, defined as the peptide concentration leading to 50% reduction in HEK293T cell viability, were determined for each of the 80 synthesized archaeasins (Fig. 4d). The cytotoxicity data are summarized in a heat map, indicating the concentration ranges at which cytotoxic effects were observed (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 7).

Of the 80 archaeasins tested, the majority displayed low cytotoxicity, with CC50 values exceeding 128 µmol l−1. Specifically, 26 archaeasins showed CC50 values higher than 128 µmol l−1, suggesting minimal cytotoxic effects within the tested concentration range. However, a subset of archaeasins showed low to moderate cytotoxicity. Notably, archaeasin-12, archaeasin-13, archaeasin-32, archaeasin-54, archaeasin-58, archaeasin-64 and archaeasin78, which also showed haemolytic activity, had CC50 values at or below 64 µmol l−1, indicating potential off-target toxicity.

Interestingly, most archaeasins with potent antibacterial activity (low MIC values) did not show significant cytotoxicity towards HEK293T cells at those concentrations. This selective activity highlights their potential as promising antimicrobial candidates with limited cytotoxic effects on human cells.

To evaluate whether the lead archaeasins retained their antimicrobial potency in complex living systems, we tested them in two mouse models: a skin abscess model28,29,30 and a deep thigh infection model4,5 (Fig. 5a). In both models, we used A. baumannii, a pathogen responsible for infections in the blood, urinary tract, lungs, and topical wounds, and a major cause of mortality in hospitalized patients due to its antimicrobial resistance31. Three lead archaeasins showed potent activity against A. baumannii and no cytotoxicity (CC50 < 64 μmol l−1): archaeasin-2 (MIC value = 4 μmol l−1) from Aeropyrum pernix, archaeasin-17 (MIC value = 2 μmol l−1) from Ignicoccus hospitalis and archaeasin-73 (MIC value = 8 μmol l−1) from Sulfurisphaera tokodaii.

Source data

In the skin abscess model, infection was established with a 20 μl bacterial load of 1.2 × 105 A. baumannii cells in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) applied to a wounded area of the skin (Fig. 5a). A single dose of each archaeasin at their respective MIC was administered to the infected area. Two days post-infection, all tested archaeasins showed significantly reduced bacterial counts by 1.5 to 2 orders of magnitude. Archaeasin-73, in particular, reduced the bacterial load by two orders of magnitude compared with the untreated control group. Its potency was comparable to that observed in the positive control group of mice treated with polymyxin B and was higher than that of the levofloxacin control group (Fig. 5b). Four days post-infection, all archaeasins and the two antibiotics, polymyxin B and levofloxacin, continued to prevent bacterial growth with similar efficacy. Polymyxin B reduced bacterial counts by four orders of magnitude compared with the untreated control group of mice, while all other treatment groups showed a two- to three-order magnitude decrease. These results are promising, as the archaeasins were administered only once after the abscess had been established, highlighting their anti-infective potential. Importantly, no significant changes in weight, used as a proxy for toxicity, were observed in our experiments (Extended Data Fig. 8a).

Next, we assessed the efficacy of the same lead archaeasins (archaeasin-2, archaeasin-17 and archaeasin-73) in a murine deep thigh infection model (Fig. 5c), which is widely used to assess the antibiotic potential of compounds. Mice were administered 2 rounds of cyclophosphamide treatment for immunosuppression before the intramuscular infection with 1 × 105 cells in 100 μl of A. baumannii. A single dose of each archaeasin (at their MIC) was delivered intraperitoneally (Fig. 5c). Four days post-treatment, the archaeasins were unable to prevent the growth of the infection, while the antibiotics polymyxin B and levofloxacin (positive controls) reduced the bacterial load by three orders of magnitude (Fig. 5d). Four days post-treatment, the bacterial counts remained stable for all peptide treatment conditions and the treatments with polymyxin B and levofloxacin, while the untreated control increased by two orders of magnitude. No significant changes in weight were observed, indicating that the archaeasins are non-toxic (Extended Data Fig. 8b). These in vivo results support the antibiotic properties of archaeasins under physiological conditions and provide a strong foundation for advancing their development as potential antimicrobial agents.

In this study, we systematically explored the archaeome using the deep learning model APEX 1.1, revealing a wealth of previously unrecognized antibiotic molecules within archaea. Our findings highlight the untapped potential of archaea as a source of antimicrobial agents32,33,34,35,36,37,38, expanding the traditional focus beyond bacteria and fungi, which have historically been the primary sources of antibiotics derived from nature.

We report the discovery of archaeasins, a class of AMPs with unique sequence diversity. Our synergy assays further underscored the potential of archaeasins to work in concert, enhancing their antimicrobial efficacy when combined. The low FICI values observed in combinations from closely related strains, particularly within the Methanocaldococcus and Methanothermobacter species, point to the possibility of developing combination therapies that leverage these synergistic effects. Such combinations could provide more effective treatment options, especially against multidrug-resistant pathogens.

Mechanism-of-action studies revealed that archaeasins primarily exert their antimicrobial effects by depolarizing the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, rather than by permeabilizing the outer membrane. This finding is particularly intriguing, as it suggests that archaeasins may operate through a mechanism distinct from that of conventional AMPs, which often target the outer membrane. Depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane is a critical process that disrupts bacterial homeostasis, leading to cell death. Interestingly, this mode of action aligns more closely with that of recently described small open-reading-frame-encoded peptides8.

Our in vivo experiments in mouse models showed that archaeasins retain their antimicrobial potency in complex biological systems, effectively reducing bacterial loads in both skin abscess and deep thigh infection models. The observed efficacy, particularly with archaeasin-73, which showed results comparable to that of traditional antibiotics like polymyxin B and levofloxacin, is promising. These results suggest that archaeasins have the potential to be developed into viable therapeutic agents, especially for infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens such as A. baumannii. Importantly, the lack of significant toxicity observed in these models further supports the safety profile of these peptides, a crucial consideration for future development.

Despite the promising results, several challenges and limitations remain. For instance, although the in vivo findings are encouraging, further studies are necessary to systematically evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of archaeasins, including their pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and potential immunogenicity in humans.

In addition, there are inherent limitations in using deep learning to explore archaeal proteomes as a framework for antibiotic discovery. Our current deep learning model is sequence based and lacks structural information. Although this approach allows for rapid analysis across proteomes, incorporating structural and three-dimensional descriptors in future iterations could improve the model's accuracy in predicting antimicrobial activity. To prevent APEX from making over-optimistic MIC predictions, we included ‘inactive' data points (that is, data with MICs above the maximum concentrations tested) in the model training and assigned a pseudo-MIC label of 512 μmol l−1 to them. However, the pseudo-MIC labels may not perfectly reflect the true MICs of these points, potentially introducing noise into the model. A future direction will be to use contrastive loss during model training, eliminating the need for concrete assumptions about the MICs of inactive data. Another challenge is the limited availability of information on archaeal proteins. The virtual screening of archaea proteomes was performed only on the high-quality reviewed sequences from UniProt, while the unreviewed sequences were not included in the analysis. This inevitably led to an imbalanced analysis, with some interesting clades (for example, DPANN and Asgardarchaeota) not being well characterized by APEX. In the future, we will apply APEX to screen unreviewed archaea proteins to complement this study.

In this study, we used only female mice to maintain consistency with established protocols and previous studies4,6,20,29,30,39,40, ensuring better comparability of results. However, sex-based physiological variations, including differences in immune response, hormone levels and microbiota composition, may influence infection outcomes and antimicrobial efficacy.

Another limitation is the observed decrease in efficacy of archaeasins between days 2 and 4 in the skin infection model, probably due to its susceptibility to proteolytic degradation and clearance in vivo. Addressing this challenge will require future studies to explore peptide stabilization strategies, such as chemical modifications (for example, d-amino acid incorporation, cyclization or PEGylation), to enhance in vivo stability and extend their therapeutic efficacy.

In addition, although EPs have been shown to be less likely to promote bacterial resistance than conventional antibiotics4,30, future studies will evaluate the potential for archaeasins to induce resistance.

A comparison with random sequences matching organismal amino acid distributions would shed additional light on how sequence composition influences antimicrobial potential. In our previous work3, scrambled versions of EPs from bacteria, which no longer reflect the natural arrangement of amino acids, were inactive. This result suggests that the biologically derived sequences are essential for the antimicrobial effect. Furthermore, we4,7,41,42 and others43 have reported the discovery of bioactive ‘hidden' or ‘encrypted' peptides in proteomes. Altogether, this work38 supports our hypothesis7 that many previously unrecognized bioactive peptides, including those derived from the human proteome7, can play critical roles in host immunity and other physiological processes7.

In conclusion, our study shows the promise of using deep learning to unlock the archaeome as a source of antibiotics. The discovery of archaeasins warrants further development of these agents, opening a new frontier in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.

All reviewed canonical and isoform sequences of archaea (taxon identifier, 2157) were downloaded from UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/; access date, 24 August 2023). We were able to obtain 19,710 protein sequences (18,677 non-redundant sequences) from 233 archaeal organisms. Protein substrings ranging from 8 to 50 amino acid residues in the 18,677 sequences and containing only canonical amino acids were considered as the archaea EPs. In total, we obtained 193,331,608 EPs from the archaeome for further study.

APEX is a bacterial-strain-specific antimicrobial activity predictor6, and was trained on an in-house peptide dataset and publicly available AMPs. Here we updated the training data and retrained APEX (that is, APEX 1.1). Specifically, the updated in-house peptide dataset for training APEX contained 15,718 MIC values from 1,642 peptides and 11 pathogenic strains (A. baumannii ATCC 19606, E. coli ATCC 11775, E. coli AIC221, E. coli AIC222, K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883, P. aeruginosa PAO1, P. aeruginosa PA14, S. aureus ATCC 12600, methicillin-resistant S. aureus ATCC BAA-1556, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis ATCC 700802 and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium ATCC 700221). Inactive data points, that is, MIC values higher than maximum concentrations tested, were labelled as 512 μmol l−1. All MICs were then transformed by \(-{\log }_{10}\frac{{\rm{MIC}}\;{\rm{value}}}{1,000,000}\). In addition to the in-house data, we curated 19,564 publicly available AMPs from DBAASP11, APD3 (ref. 12) and DRAMP13 that did not overlap with our in-house data, and 9,857 non-AMPs following the instructions from refs. 44,45. These publicly available AMPs and non-AMPs were used as a data augmentation strategy during APEX training6. We followed the original APEX paper6 for hyperparameter selection. The top eight APEX models were selected to create an ensemble learning where the final MIC prediction was defined as the mean predictions of the selected models. The training of APEX 1.1 was conducted using PyTorch (v.1.11.0+cu113).

The six physico-chemical properties of peptides, including normalized hydrophobic moment, normalized hydrophobicity, net charge, disordered conformation propensity, propensity to aggregation in vitro and amphiphilicity index, were obtained from the DBAASP server11. Note that the Eisenberg and Weiss scale46 was chosen as the hydrophobicity scale.

To obtain the phylogenetic tree, the taxon identifiers of 233 archaeal organisms obtained from UniProt were uploaded to NCBI Taxonomy Common Tree (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/CommonTree/wwwcmt.cgi). Of note, 201 of 233 archaea organisms were successfully retrieved. The resulted tree file from NCBI was then visualized via iTOL (https://itol.embl.de/). The distance of two nodes in the phylogenetic tree is defined as the length of the shortest path between these two nodes.

Let SW(i, j) denote the Smith–Waterman alignment score47 between two protein sequences i and j. We define the peptide sequence similarity between i and j as \(\frac{{\rm{SW}}(i,\;j)}{\sqrt{{\rm{SW}}\left(i,i\right){\rm{SW}}(j,\;j)}}\).

Given a peptide dataset, we calculated a similarity matrix to represent the pairwise sequence similarities among the peptides. We then applied UMAP to transform this similarity matrix into a two-dimensional space. This transformed space serves as a proxy for the peptide sequence space, allowing us to visualize the distribution of peptides within it.

APEX 1.1 was used to predict the antimicrobial activity for the 193,331,608 EPs derived from the archaeome. We used the mean MIC value against the 11 pathogen strains to rank and select the EPs for chemical synthesis and experimental validation (Supplementary Data 2). When selecting the peptides, we also made sure they met the following criteria:

The selected peptide should have <70% sequence similarity to all in-house peptides and publicly available AMPs.

The selected peptides themselves should have <70% sequence similarity.

The selected peptide should have ≤80 μmol l−1 mean MIC by prediction (there are 265 peptides that meet all three criteria, so we selected the synthesized peptides from the top 265 scored peptides from the 193,331,608 screened ones).

To facilitate chemical synthesis and minimize undesired side products, we excluded from the APEX selection all peptides containing more than one cysteine residue.

Peptides with multiple cysteines often require specialized conditions for disulfide bond formation and may introduce structural heterogeneity that complicates downstream validation.

Peptide sequences with high potential for aggregation (motifs known to cause aggregation and hydrophobic clusters) were also excluded from the selection.

All peptides used in the experiments were purchased from AAPPTec and synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) strategy.

In this study, we used the following pathogenic bacterial strains obtained from the ATCC: A. baumannii ATCC 19606, E. coli ATCC 11775, K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883, P. aeruginosa PAO1, P. aeruginosa PA14, S. aureus ATCC 12600, S. aureus ATCC BAA-1556 (methicillin-resistant strain), E. faecalis ATCC 700802 (vancomycin-resistant strain) and E. faecium ATCC 700221 (vancomycin-resistant strain). E. coli AIC221 (E. coli MG1655 phnE_2::FRT; control strain for AIC222) and E. coli AIC222 (E. coli MG1655 pmrA53 phnE_2::FRT; polymyxin resistant, colistin-resistant strain) were kindly donated by Prof. Mark Goulian (University of Pennsylvania). Pseudomonas Isolation (P. aeruginosa strains) agar plates were exclusively used in the case of Pseudomonas species. All other pathogens were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and on LB agar. In all experiments, bacteria were inoculated from 1 isolated colony and grown overnight (16 h) in liquid medium at 37 °C. On the following day, inoculums were diluted 1:100 in fresh media and incubated at 37 °C to mid-logarithmic phase.

HEK293T cells were obtained from ATCC (CRL-3216). RBCs and human serum were purchased from Zen-Bio. The RBC samples were obtained from the same certified healthy donor (blood type A−).

Broth microdilution assays were performed to determine the MIC values of each peptide. Peptides were added to non-treated polystyrene microtitre 96-well plates and 2-fold serially diluted in sterile water from 1 μmol l−1 to 64 μmol l−1. Bacterial inoculum at 4 × 106 colony-forming units (CFU) per ml in LB medium was mixed 1:1 with the peptide. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of peptide able to completely inhibit the bacterial growth after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. All assays were done in three independent replicates.

The circular dichroism experiments were conducted using a J1500 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter (Jasco) in the Biological Chemistry Resource Center (BCRC) at the University of Pennsylvania. Experiments were performed at 25 °C, the spectra graphed are an average of 3 accumulations obtained with a quartz cuvette with an optical path length of 1.0 mm, ranging from 190 nm to 260 nm at a rate of 50 nm min−1 and a bandwidth of 0.5 nm. The concentration of all peptides tested was 50 μmol l−1, and the measurements were performed in water, a mixture of TFE and water in a 3:2 ratio, and SDS in water at 10 mmol l−1, with respective baselines recorded before measurement. A Fourier transform filter was applied to minimize background effects. Secondary structure fraction values were calculated using the single spectra analysis tool on the server BeStSel18. Ternary plots48,49 were created in https://www.ternaryplot.com/ and subsequently edited.

Combinations of two EPs from the same protein were tested against A. baumannii ATCC 19606 strains using the checkerboard assay. Briefly, 2-fold serial dilutions of each peptide were orthogonally mixed and incubated with a bacterial suspension at a final concentration of 2 × 106 CFU ml−1 in LB for 24 h at 37 °C. The FICIs were defined to attribute whether the interactions between peptides were synergistic (FICI ≤ 0.5), additive (0.5 > FICI ≥ 1) or indifferent (FICI > 1), and were calculated using the following equation:

where A and B are the two peptides, old MIC represents the MIC values obtained for the standalone peptides, and new MIC values are defined by the MIC values obtained for the combination of peptides, considering the checkerboard assay.

The NPN uptake assay was used to evaluate the ability of the peptides to permeabilize the bacterial outer membrane. Inocula of A. baumannii ATCC 19606 were grown to an optical density (OD) at 600 nm of 0.4, centrifuged (9,391g at 4 °C for 10 min), washed and resuspended in 5 mmol l−1 HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mmol l−1 glucose. The bacterial solution was added to a white 96-well plate (100 μl per well) together with 4 μl of NPN at 0.5 mmol l−1. Peptides diluted in water were then added to each well, and fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength (λex) of 350 nm and an emission wavelength (λem) of 420 nm for 45 min. The relative fluorescence was calculated using the untreated control (buffer + bacteria + fluorescence dye) and polymyxin B (positive control) as baselines, and the following equation was applied to reflect the percentage of difference between the baselines and the sample:

The cytoplasmic membrane depolarization assay was performed using the membrane-potential-sensitive dye DiSC3-5. A. baumannii ATCC 19606 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 in the mid-logarithmic phase were washed and resuspended at an OD of 0.05 (optical density value at 600 nm) in HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) containing 20 mmol l−1 glucose and 0.1 mol l−1 KCl. DiSC3-5 at 20 μmol l−1 was added to the bacterial suspension (100 μl per well) for 15 min to stabilize the fluorescence, which indicates the incorporation of the dye into the bacterial membrane. Peptides were then mixed 1:1 with the bacteria to a final concentration corresponding to their minimal inhibitory concentration needed to kill 100% of the bacterial cells (MIC100) values. Membrane depolarization was then followed by reading changes in the fluorescence (λex = 622 nm, λem = 670 nm) over time for 60 min. The relative fluorescence was calculated using the untreated control (buffer + bacteria + fluorescence dye) and polymyxin B (positive control) as baselines, and the following equation was applied to reflect the percentage of difference between the baselines and the sample:

Cytoplasmic membrane order in A. baumannii was assessed using the generalized polarization of Laurdan fluorescence. Overnight cultures were prepared in LB broth and subcultured 1:100 into fresh PBS supplemented with 0.1–0.2% glucose. Cultures were grown at 37 °C with shaking (21g) until mid-log phase (OD600 ≈ 0.5). Bacterial cells were pelleted, washed 2× and resuspended in Laurdan buffer (PBS with 0.1–0.2% glucose and 1% dimethylformamide) to an OD600 of 0.5. Laurdan (10 μmol l−1 final concentration from a 0.5 mmol l−1 stock in dimethylformamide) was added, and cells were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in the dark. After washing, 200 μl aliquots were transferred in triplicate into a black 96-well plate. Peptides (at 100× MIC) or benzyl alcohol (positive control; 5 mmol l−1 final concentration) were added (2 μl per well; 1:100 dilution), and fluorescence was monitored over 30 min in 1-min intervals using a plate reader (λex = 350 nm, λem = 440 nm and 490 nm). Controls included untreated cells, buffer with Laurdan only and Laurdan-stained cells without peptide treatment. Generalized polarization was calculated as:

To evaluate the release of haemoglobin from human erythrocytes upon treatment of each of the EPs, human RBCs were obtained from Zen-Bio (male donor, blood type A−) obtained from heparin anti-coagulated blood. RBCs were washed with PBS (pH 7.4) 4× by centrifugation at 800g for 10 min. Aliquots of 200-fold-diluted cells (75 μl) were mixed with peptide solution (0.78–100 μmol l−1; 75 μl), and the mixture was incubated for 4 h at room temperature. After incubation, the plate was centrifuged at 1,300g for 10 min to precipitate cells and debris, and 100 μl of supernatant from each well was transferred to a new 96-well plate for absorbance reading (405 nm) using an automatic plate reader. The percentage of haemolysis was defined by comparison with negative control (samples containing PBS) and positive control (samples containing 1% (v/v) SDS in PBS solution).

The cells were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% penicillin and streptomycin (antibiotics) and 10% fetal bovine serum and grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

One day before the experiment, 100 μl aliquots of HEK293T cells, at a concentration of 50,000 cells ml−1, were seeded into each well of 96-well plates (5,000 cells per well). Following cell attachment, the HEK293T cells were treated with increasing concentrations of peptides (ranging from 8 μmol l−1 to 128 μmol l−1) and incubated for 24 h. After the exposure period, cytotoxicity was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Specifically, the MTT reagent was prepared at a concentration of 0.5 mg ml−1 in phenol red-free medium and used to replace the peptide-containing supernatants (100 μl per well). The plates were then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2, facilitating the formation of insoluble formazan crystals. These crystals were subsequently dissolved in 0.04 mol l−1 hydrochloric acid prepared in anhydrous isopropanol. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer to quantify cell viability. All experiments were conducted in triplicate (three biological replicates).

The backs of 6-week-old female CD-1 mice under anaesthesia were shaved and injured with a superficial linear skin abrasion made with a needle. An aliquot of A. baumannii ATCC 19606 (6.3 × 105 CFU ml−1; 20 μl) previously grown in LB medium to an OD of 0.5 (optical value at 600 nm) and then washed 2× with sterile PBS (pH 7.4, 9,391g for 3 min) was added to the scratched area. Peptides diluted in sterile water at their MIC value were administered to the wounded area 1 h post-infection. At 2 and 4 days post-infection, animals were killed, and a uniform excision of the scarified skin was excised, homogenized using a bead beater (25 Hz for 20 min), 10-fold serially diluted and plated on McConkey agar plates for CFU quantification. The experiments were performed using six mice per group. Mice were single-housed to avoid cross-contamination and maintained under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle at 22 °C with humidity controlled at 50%. The skin abscess infection mouse model was revised and approved by the University Laboratory Animal Resources from the University of Pennsylvania (protocol 806763).

Experiments were performed using 6-week-old female CD-1 mice, which were rendered neutropenic by intraperitoneal application of 2 doses of cyclophosphamide (150 mg kg−1 and 100 mg kg−1) at 3 and 1 days before the infection. At day 4 of the experiment, the mice were infected in their right thigh through a 100 μl intramuscular injection of A. baumannii ATCC19606 (in PBS at a concentration of 1 × 106 CFU ml−1). The bacterial cells were grown in LB broth, washed twice with PBS solution and diluted at the desired concentration before infecting the mice. The peptides were administered intraperitoneally 2 h after the infection. At 4 days post-infection, mice were killed and a uniform excision of the tissue from the right thigh was excised, homogenized using a bead beater (25 Hz for 20 min), 10-fold serially diluted and plated on McConkey agar plates for bacterial colony counting. The experiments were performed using six mice per group. Mice were housed in groups of 3 and maintained under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle at 22 °C with humidity controlled at 50%. The deep thigh infection mouse model was revised and approved by the University Laboratory Animal Resources from the University of Pennsylvania (protocol 807055).

All assays were performed in three independent biological replicates as indicated in each figure legend and in the Methods. The values obtained for haemolytic activity were estimated by nonlinear regression based on the screen of peptides in a gradient of concentrations and represent the haemolytic concentration values needed to lyse and kill 50% of the cells present in the experiment. In the skin abscess and thigh infection mouse models, we used six mice per group following established protocols approved by the University Laboratory of Animal Resources of the University of Pennsylvania.

In the mouse experiments, all the raw data were log10-transformed and statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test. All the P values are shown for each of the groups, and all groups were compared with the untreated control group. All calculation and statistical analyses of the experimental data were conducted using GraphPad Prism v.10.3. Statistical significance between different groups was calculated using the tests indicated in each figure legend. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.

The archaeome was systematically mined using our deep learning algorithm, APEX. Peptide sequences ranging from 8 to 50 amino acid residues within archaeal proteins were analyzed through multitask deep learning models trained on both public and in-house peptide datasets to predict antimicrobial activity. The top-ranked peptides, based on their predicted antimicrobial potential, were chemically synthesized and extensively evaluated against clinically relevant pathogens in both in vitro and animal model studies. Comprehensive assays were conducted to investigate the mechanism of action, toxicity, physicochemical properties, and potential synergistic interactions of these peptides. The protein and peptide structures depicted in the figure were created with PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, version 3.0 Schrödinger, LLC. Figure created with BioRender.com.

(a) Bidimensional sequence space visualization of peptide sequences found in DBAASP, all predicted antimicrobial EPs discovered by APEX, and peptides that were synthesized and validated in this study. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was used to reduce the feature representation to two dimensions for visualization purposes. (b) Frequency of the gene ontology annotations of the top 265 archaeasins with mean MIC < 80 μmol L−1. (c) Amino acid frequency in archaeasins compared with known AMPs from DBAASP, APD3, and DRAMP 3.0 databases, and other encrypted peptides from the human proteome discovered by APEX6 and a scoring function4. (d) To further explore differences at the individual residue level, we calculated the percentage of each amino acid residue within every peptide sequence and used a one-sided Mann-Whitney U test to compare these percentages between peptide sets. A significance threshold of p < 0.01 was used to identify amino acids that were significantly more or less abundant between specific sets. The exact p-values for each comparison are shown in Supplementary Data 3 and 4 files (under Data availability). (e-g) Relative abundance of the amino acid content of Archaea encrypted peptides identified by APEX (red) and (d) AMPs from the DBAASP, APD3, and DRAMP 3.0 database (blue), (e) human proteome encrypted peptides discovered by APEX (orange), and (f) human encrypted peptides found by the scoring function (yellow). The frequency of amino acid was normalized by the total number of amino acid residue counts. Chi-square test of independence of variables in a contingency table was used to compare the amino acid composition in c-f, p values were 0, that is, below machine precision levels suggesting that they are statistically significant.

Source data

(a) Net charge and (b) normalized hydrophobicity. (c) Hydrophobic moment normalized by peptide length, reflecting the amphipathicity of the molecules, which directly influences their interactions with bacterial membranes. (d) Amphiphilicity index and (e) disordered conformation propensity, both of which are closely correlated with the mechanism of action, specifically how peptides interact with membrane lipids to exert antimicrobial activity. (f) Propensity to aggregate in vitro, correlated with the supramolecular arrangement of the molecules and potential toxicity. Statistical significance was determined using two-tailed t-tests followed by the Mann-Whitney test; p values are shown in the graph. The solid line within each box represents the mean value for each group.

Source data

(a) Heatmap showing the activity of the antibiotics polymyxin B and levofloxacin used as controls in our experiments. The results represent the mode of three independent replicates. (b) Each peptide is represented by a red circle on the scatter plot. The inset includes Pearson (r) and Spearman (ρ) correlation coefficients, R-squared (R2), p-value, and the slope (m) of the linear regression.

Source data

Circular dichroism experiments were conducted with encrypted peptides from the archaeome using a J-1500 Jasco circular dichroism spectrophotometer. The spectra were recorded in three different media: (a) water, (b) 60% trifluoroethanol in water, and (c) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in water (10 mmol L−1), after three accumulations at 25 °C, using a 1 mm path length quartz cell, between 260 and 190 nm at 50 nm min−1, with a bandwidth of 0.5 nm. The concentration of all peptides tested was 50 μmol L−1. (d) Heatmap with the percentage of secondary structure found for each peptide in three different solvents: water, 60% trifluoroethanol (TFE) in water, and SDS (10 mmol L−1) in water. Secondary structure fraction was calculated using the BeStSel server18.

Source data

(a-c) Outer membrane permeabilization was assessed using the probe 1-(N-phenylamino)naphthalene (NPN), showing the permeabilization effects of Archaea-encoded encrypted peptides active against A. baumannii ATCC 19606: (a) relative fluorescence, (b) fluorescence intensity, and (c) summary of the relative fluorescence in different time points of the experiment. (d-f) Membrane depolarization assays were performed using the hydrophobic probe 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide [DiSC3-(5)] on all archaeasins active against A. baumannii ATCC 19606: (d) relative fluorescence, (e) fluorescence intensity, and (f) summary of the relative fluorescence in different time points of the experiment. Polymyxin B served as a positive control, while buffer, buffer with the probe, and buffer with both probe and bacteria were used as baseline controls for fluorescence. Error bars are the standard deviation obtained from the three replicates and relative fluorescence is shown as a non-linear regression of the fluorescence intensity normalized by the untreated control (buffer).

Source data

Hemolytic activity was assessed by exposing red blood cells to archaeasins, with lysis determined by absorbance readings after 4 h. The peptides were added to plates and subjected to a two-fold dilution series (ranging from 64 to 4 μmol L−1) before exposure to the red blood cells.

Source data

Mouse weight was monitored throughout the duration of the (a) skin abscess model (4 days total) and the (b) deep thigh infection model (8 days total) to assess potential toxic effects of both the bacterial load and the archaeasins.

The election of US President Donald Trump last year triggered widespread concern in the US scientific community, but some researchers saw a glimmer of hope in the form of Michael Kratsios — the president's chief science adviser. Scientists who had worked with Kratsios during Trump's first presidency, from 2017 to 2021, had mostly good things to say when Trump nominated him in December: although Kratsios is not a scientist, he had previously shown support for science and a willingness to listen to and work with the scientific community.

Researchers also took it as a positive sign that Kratsios' nomination to lead the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) came early, and that he was given the official title ‘assistant to the president', which theoretically grants him easier access to Trump. Kratsios' predecessor from the first Trump administration, meteorologist Kelvin Droegemeier, arrived two years into the president's term and without such a title.

In the announcement in late December, Trump credited Kratsios' previous service as the US chief technology officer and his brief role overseeing defence research. Along with the announcement, Trump promised to “unleash scientific breakthroughs, ensure America's technological dominance, and usher in a Golden Age of American Innovation!”

Now, four months after his Senate confirmation, Kratsios is beginning to make his mark as he pushes the president's science agenda. Although some scientists and scholars are withholding judgement for now, many feel dismayed. In their view, Kratsios has done nothing publicly to defend science, even as the Trump administration slashes science budgets, terminates research grants and projects, fires government scientists and attacks universities. His public comments have typically reinforced the administration's arguments that science and academia, like government, have become liberally biased and bureaucratic institutions that need to be downsized and then jolted back to life.

In particular, Kratsios' first major initiative — a directive calling on federal agencies to promote ‘gold standard science' — has attracted widespread criticism for undermining and politicizing science. Most crucially, the guidance expands political power over sensitive science topics and questions of alleged research misconduct. When Kratsios defended the effort in an editorial in the journal Science on 24 June (M. Kratsios Science 389, 7; 2025), one of his predecessors, John Holdren, went so far as to publish a letter in Science accusing Kratsios of deploying Orwellian doublespeak to defend a proposal that will further enable the Trump administration's attacks on science. “And now the fox in the henhouse overseeing it all is Michael Kratsios?” wrote Holdren, a physicist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who served as science adviser to former US president Barack Obama. “What a charade!”

Holdren is not alone. “We were really hopeful that Kratsios would defend science, but it doesn't look like he is going to do that,” says Kenneth Evans, a science-policy researcher at Rice University in Houston, Texas. The question now, Evans adds, is whether Kratsios and the Trump administration will present a positive agenda for science. “Tearing everything down doesn't seem like a way forward.”

Kratsios declined multiple interview requests from Nature, and the OSTP declined to comment on the allegations in this article.

Kratsios earned a bachelor's degree in politics at Princeton University in New Jersey in 2008, but quickly moved to finance. In 2010, he went to work for the controversial Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, who runs a venture-capital firm with a focus on technology companies. Thiel is a critic of the modern science and innovation system and a long-time supporter of Trump.

Kratsios' early supporters credit him with pushing new strategic policies on artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing forwards during his first stint in the White House. They also say he kept the OSTP office running until Droegemeier was confirmed in January 2019.

“For two years, we had no director, and he was really holding down the fort,” says Tobin Smith, senior vice-president for government relations and public policy at the Association of American Universities (AAU) in Washington DC. Smith says the AAU's interactions with Kratsios were positive during the first administration, but says it's too early to say what the OSTP might get done under his watch this time around. “The verdict is still out.”

Unlike Droegemeier during Trump's first administration, Kratsios has not shied away from speaking out — and doing so in highly political terms. In his first policy speech at a conference in Austin, Texas, on 14 April, less than three weeks after his confirmation, Kratsios accused the administration of former president Joe Biden of leading with “a spirit of fear rather than promise” and “promoting social division and redistribution in the name of equity”. He then laid out a bleak assessment of US science, arguing that the US innovation system must be renewed to achieve “the Golden Age of American innovation”.

“As we look forward to America's 250th birthday celebration next year,” he said, “our progress today pales in comparison to the huge leaps of the 20th century.”

Several scientists who have worked directly with Kratsios expressed little doubt that he wants to promote science and technology, whether by reducing bureaucratic paperwork or introducing new funding models to encourage innovative research. He leans into areas such as AI, nuclear power and drones, and he wants to produce tangible change rather than written reports, says one scientist who recently departed the OSTP and requested anonymity to speak freely about their time with Kratsios.

“I do think he cares deeply about the American science and technology enterprise,” says the scientist, “but he's more of a technologist than a scientist”.

And that is precisely the problem, says Michael Lubell, a physicist at the City College of New York in New York City, who has studied the history of US science policy. Science advisers dating back to the Second World War varied by discipline and philosophy and served administrations of different political stances, Lubell says, but they were all scientists or engineers who could represent and speak to the research community. He says Kratsios' expertise rests with technology.

Trump's call for ‘gold standard science' has prompted an outcry: here's why

Trump's call for ‘gold standard science' has prompted an outcry: here's why

“He does not come from the science community, he does not know the science community and he does not understand the intellectual content of the science community,” Lubell says. “He is a mouthpiece for the president.”

Several scientists who have worked with Kratsios say he has a knack for picking up scientific terms and ideas, knowing his audience and reading the political terrain. It's unclear how he will balance competing demands in his current role. As science adviser and head of the OSTP, Kratsios needs to be responsive to the president's priorities while representing the scientific community's needs, says Gretchen Goldman, who leads the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and who worked on scientific-integrity policies at the OSTP under Biden. “Those two things are just fundamentally in opposition under this administration, so I don't see how Kratsios could win.”

Kratsios caught many scientists and policy specialists off guard with his first signature initiative: the gold-standard-science policy, which Trump unveiled on 23 May in an executive order that also repealed scientific-integrity policies put in place across the federal government under Biden. Kratsios followed up with guidance laying out nine core tenets, starting with reproducibility and transparency, designed to ensure that science conducted or funded by the government is “beyond reproach”.

Although the basic framing sounds reasonable at first, Goldman and others have raised a host of criticisms. One is that a guidance document on the gold-standard-science policy issued by the OSTP contains transparency language that seems to echo a controversial ‘secret science' rule put in place at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the first Trump administration (see go.nature.com/4fnb9pk). The EPA rule, which was blocked by a federal court and killed by the Biden administration, sought to require that the underlying data for science used in public policy be made publicly available, but critics argued that the policy could eliminate the ability of epidemiologists and other researchers at the agency to rely on certain types of public-health data that cannot be released owing to rules designed to protect individuals' privacy.

We developed a large language model-based framework to predict the magnitude of aging across diverse populations using unstructured and heterogeneous data. The predicted aging was highly correlated with multiple aging-related outcomes. Our research suggests that large language models can do more than generate text — they can also predict a person's aging status.

Nature Synthesis

                         (2025)Cite this article


The development of a general strategy for stereospecific construction of every type of glycosidic linkage remains a much sought-after yet unrealized goal. Such a strategy would be particularly useful in the context of complex glycan syntheses. Glycosylations involving an SN2 mechanism are ideal to ensure stereospecificity but have been challenging to implement in a manner conferring generality across a range of sugars. Here we disclose a stereospecific glycosylation method that accommodates a broad range of monosaccharides, including hexopyranoses (for example, glucose, galactose, mannose, fucose, alluronate, 2-azido-2-deoxyglucose and 2-azido-2-deoxygalactose) and pentofuranoses (for example, arabinose, ribose, xylose and lyxose). Mild activation with an electrophilic bromine reagent results in complete inversion of the anomeric configuration and excellent yields for many glycosylations. The method proved reliable in multistep oligosaccharide syntheses and automated glycan assembly.

The Photorhabdus virulence cassette is a microbial nanosyringe that can be engineered to deliver protein cargos into human cells. Here we further modify this system to incorporate exogenous cargos and targeting moieties in vitro. We show that this method, termed SPEAR, enables loading of different types of cargo (including folded ribonucleoproteins and single-stranded DNA) and targeting of defined cell types both in vitro and in vivo.

Contractile injection systems (CISs) encompass a broad class of syringe-like protein complexes that enable prokaryotes and their viruses to inject effector molecules into nearby cells1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. We previously reprogrammed an extracellular CIS (the Photorhabdus virulence cassette (PVC)) to deliver proteins into human cells13, highlighting this system's potential for use as a therapeutic delivery technology. Here, we engineer PVCs to extend their utility, enabling delivery of different types of cargo and compatibility with a wider range of cell-type-specific targeting proteins, leading to a system termed spike engineering and retargeting (SPEAR; Fig. 1a,b).

a,b, SPEAR harnesses two attachment points to enable modular in vitro cargo loading (via self-assembly of Pvc10 onto Pvc8) and retargeting (via conjugation of antibodies to Pvc13). c, A cargo domain (Cas9) fused to the PVC spike (Pvc8) or spike tip (Pvc10) can be visualized loading onto PVCs. A novel density (designated with an arrow) can be observed at the base of the particle; scale bar, 25 nm. d, RT–qPCR analysis of the complexes from c indicates that Pvc8/Pvc10–Cas9 fusions can load onto PVCs as RNPs. e, PVCs can deliver Cas9 RNPs into HEK293FT cells. Cas9 activity required proper PVC targeting; T, targeted (Pvc13–Ad5 knob); UT, untargeted (truncated Pvc13). f, Comparison of spike-based cargo loading (this study) to tube-based (internal) cargo loading13,21. Cas9 loaded into the PVC tube (via N-terminal fusion of the Pdp1 N-terminal domain (NTD)) was unable to co-deliver sgRNA, while Pvc8/Pvc10–Cas9 yielded transfection-independent gene editing. g, Spike-based cargo loading can be combined with tube-based cargo loading to enable delivery of a two-component base editor (ZFD) with a single PVC design. All values in d–g are shown as mean ± s.d. with n = 5 biological replicates. Statistical significance was computed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Bonferroni post hoc test; ****P < 0.0001; ***P < 0.001; NS, not significant.

Source data

In our first-generation PVC design, we used the injection system's native cargo loading mechanism, which is limited to proteins. To accommodate different cargos, we took inspiration from a related family of CISs (type VI secretion systems (T6SSs)), which can fuse cargo domains to the spike at the base of the complex14,15,16,17. Given the structural similarity between the T6SS spike complex (VgrG/PAAR) and the PVC spike complex (Pvc8/Pvc10)3,14,18, and the fact that T6SSs have been successfully engineered to load exogenous cargos via the spike19,20, we imagined implementing an analogous spike-mediated cargo loading strategy in PVCs (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). After deleting endogenous cargos, we fused a heterologous cargo domain (Cas9) to the spike (Pvc8) or spike tip (Pvc10) in an arrangement similar to that seen in T6SSs and analyzed the resulting purified PVCs with negative-stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We identified nascent densities at the base of each PVC particle likely corresponding to loaded Cas9 (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). Two separate densities were observed with a Pvc10 design carrying two Cas9 domains (Cas9–Pvc10–Cas9), and three were observed when Cas9 was fused to the trimeric Pvc8 (Pvc8–Cas9), confirming that these densities likely corresponded to Cas9 cargos loaded onto the spike complex.

Although we previously demonstrated that Cas9 could be loaded into PVCs internally (via the tube)13, we were unable to load Cas9 in the complex with single guide RNA (sgRNA), likely because cargos are unfolded during loading into the tube21. However, our TEM results in Fig. 1c suggested that cargos loaded onto the spike complex remain folded; therefore, we sought to test if we could use this method to load and deliver Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). We found that PVCs harboring Pvc8/Pvc10–Cas9 fusions, when coexpressed with sgRNA, purified with an approximately five-log enrichment of sgRNA over PVCs harboring unmodified spike complexes (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1f). Furthermore, when these PVCs (carrying an Ad5 knob domain in Pvc13 to allow for targeting of human cells13, used in all live-cell experiments in this work unless specified otherwise) were added to HEK293FT cells, we observed on-target insertions and deletions (indels) without co-transfection of sgRNA (Fig. 1e,f and Extended Data Fig. 1g,h), indicating that Cas9 RNPs loaded onto the PVC spike are also functionally delivered. Finally, we also found that spike-based cargo loading can be combined with tube-based cargo loading, enabling the delivery of both halves of a two-component base editing system (the zinc finger deaminase (ZFD)22) by a single PVC design (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 1i).

In addition to delivering folded proteins and RNPs, Pvc10-based cargo loading may offer another advantage: because Pvc10 is an external component of the PVC and is not required for assembly of the full complex3, it might be able to self-assemble onto PVCs lacking Pvc10 in vitro, enabling loading of a wide variety of synthetic cargos (for instance, chemically modified cargos) that might be difficult to load in vivo (Fig. 2a). We found that separately purified Pvc10 protein readily assembles onto Δpvc10 PVCs in vitro, fully rescuing the activity of these particles (which were loaded with Cre internally13) against HEK293FT cells harboring a Cre reporter (loxP–green fluorescent protein (loxP–GFP); Fig. 2b). Furthermore, when Δpvc10 PVCs (lacking internal cargos) were incubated with Pvc10–Cas9 RNPs and added to HEK293FT cells, we observed on-target indels (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2a), indicating the feasibility of this in vitro cargo loading approach.

a, Proposed model of in vitro cargo loading via Pvc10. Pvc10–cargo fusions can likely load onto PVCs via an interaction between Pvc10 and the untipped spike (Pvc8). b, Incubation with separately purified Pvc10 protein in vitro rescues the activity of Δpvc10 PVCs (loaded internally with Cre13) in HEK293FT cells co-transfected with loxP–GFP. Activity of Δpvc10 PVCs complemented with Pvc10 in vitro approached that of unmutated PVCs lacking the pvc10 deletion. c, Δpvc10 PVCs incubated with Cas9 RNPs tethered to Pvc10 (Pvc10–Cas9RNP) in vitro produce on-target indels in HEK293FT cells. d, Proposed model of in vitro DNA loading via Pvc10. PVCs harboring an HUHe tag in Pvc10 are incubated with ssODNs containing an HUHe-specific recognition sequence, allowing for covalent conjugation of ssODNs to Pvc10, which enables spike-mediated translocation of ssDNA. e, PVCs loaded with ssODN HDR templates in vitro (as described in d) produce targeted 6-bp DNA insertions in HEK293FT cells following Cas9 genomic cleavage (conferred via pretransfection of a Cas9/sgRNA plasmid). f, PVCs can deliver DNA, RNA and protein simultaneously. PVCs loaded with Cas9 RNPs (as in Fig. 1e) and ssODN HDR templates (as in e) via a single multidomain Pvc10 design (HUHe–Pvc10–Cas9RNP) yield both indels and DNA insertions in untransfected HEK293FT cells. g, Proposed model of in vitro retargeting of PVCs using self-conjugating protein tags. PVCs containing ST or SNAP in the distal domain of the targeting element (Pvc13) are covalently conjugated to antibodies (scFvs or mAbs) labeled with SC or BG, altering the binding specificity of Pvc13. h,i, Endogenous toxin-loaded PVCs conjugated with an anti-HA tag single-chain antibody (scFvanti-HA) via ST/SC (h) or an mAb to CD3 (mAbanti-CD3) via SNAP/BG (i) kill human cells displaying the cognate binding partners for these antibodies (BJ–HA and Jurkat cells, respectively). j, PVCs retargeted in vitro are highly target specific, enabling programmable population editing. Toxin-loaded PVCs carrying Pvc13–ST were retargeted in vitro (as in g–i) with either an SC-labeled anti-EGFR DARPin (DARPinanti-EGFR–SC) or an SC-labeled anti-mouse MHC class II Nb (Nbanti-MHCII–SC) and were subsequently added to a mixed population of EGFR+ cells (A431) and MHC class II+ cells (A20). Retargeted PVCs selectively inhibited only one cell type within the mixed population. All values (b, c, e, f and h–j) are shown as mean ± s.d. with n = 5 biological replicates. Statistical significance was computed using one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post hoc test; ****P < 0.0001; NS, not significant.

Source data

We next sought to harness Pvc10 to load an entirely different category of cargos: single-stranded DNA (ssDNA; Fig. 2d). We fused an HUH endonuclease (HUHe) domain23,24 to Pvc10 and incubated the resulting Pvc10–HUHe PVCs with ~100-nt ssDNA oligonucleotides (ssODNs) containing both an HUHe-specific recognition sequence and a homology-directed repair (HDR) template designed to yield a 6-bp insertion in the human VEGFA locus (Extended Data Fig. 2b). After adding the resulting DNA-loaded PVCs to HEK293FT cells pretransfected with a Cas9/sgRNA plasmid, we observed the intended insertions at this locus (Fig. 2e). In addition, PVCs loaded with both Cas9 RNPs (via C-terminal fusion of Cas9 to Pvc10, as in Fig. 1c–f) and HUHe–ssODNs (via N-terminal fusion of HUHe to Pvc10 followed by in vitro conjugation of ssODNs, as in Fig. 2e) produced both Cas9-mediated indels and ssODN-mediated DNA insertions in untransfected HEK293FT cells (Fig. 2f), indicating that PVCs can deliver Cas9 RNPs and ssDNA HDR templates simultaneously via a single multidomain Pvc10 fusion.

To further extend the utility of PVCs for delivery, we sought to expand the breadth of cell types targetable by this system. Previously, we showed that small binding proteins, such as DARPins and nanobodies (Nbs), could be genetically inserted into the targeting element (Pvc13); however, larger targeting proteins (such as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)) were incompatible with this strategy. To overcome this limitation, we inserted bioconjugation tags (SpyTag (ST) or SNAP-tag (SNAP)) into the distal binding domain of Pvc13, enabling us to covalently conjugate Pvc13 to full-sized antibodies (scFvs and mAbs) containing SpyCatcher (SC)25,26 or benzylguanine (BG)27 in vitro (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). When PVCs harboring Pvc13–ST or Pvc13–SNAP were incubated with an anti-HA tag scFv fused to SC (scFvanti-HA–SC) or an mAb to CD3 labeled with BG (mAbanti-CD3–BG), respectively, we observed robust delivery activity in human cells displaying appropriate binding partners for these antibodies (BJ stably displaying HA tag (BJ–HA) or Jurkat cells, respectively; Fig. 2h,i and Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). Because the majority of publicly available binding proteins specific for human cell surface receptors are mAbs and scFvs, this result greatly expands the cell types and tissues targetable by PVCs.

We next asked whether PVCs retargeted in vitro retain the high level of target specificity observed previously with retargeted PVCs13. Using the ST/SC retargeting method, we conjugated toxin-loaded PVCs with either of two different binding domains, the anti-mouse MHC class II Nb VHH7 (Nbanti-MHCII)28 or the anti-human EGFR DARPin E01 (DARPinanti-EGFR)29, and applied the resulting retargeted PVCs to an approximately 1:1 coculture of cells expressing either mouse MHC class II (A20) or human EGFR (A431). We found that each PVC treatment selectively depleted only a single subset of cells within the mixed population: PVCs conjugated with Nbanti-MHCII selectively inhibited A20 cells, and PVCs functionalized with DARPinanti-EGFR selectively inhibited A431 cells (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 3e–g). In addition, after systemic administration of similar anti-mouse MHC class II-targeting PVCs (conjugated with Nbanti-MHCII) into mice, we observed a roughly 7% bulk depletion of MHC class II+ cells in the mouse spleen without significant impact on off-target cell populations (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c) and with only minor neutralizing immunity (Extended Data Fig. 4d), indicating that PVCs functionalized in vitro can be leveraged to specifically target defined cell types in vivo. This could be useful for delivery applications targeting circulating immune cells; for instance, reprogramming B cells for sustained therapeutic production30.

Finally, we tested whether Pvc8/Pvc10-based in vitro cargo loading (Fig. 2a–f) and ST/SC-based in vitro retargeting (Fig. 2g–j) can be combined into a single in vitro complementation reaction (Extended Data Fig. 5a). We found that when PVCs lacking both a cargo and a targeting moiety (Δpvc10/Pvc13–ST) were incubated with separately purified Pvc10–Cas9RNP and Ad5 knob–SC, the resulting reprogrammed PVCs produced on-target edits in HEK293FT cells (Extended Data Fig. 5b), indicating that these particles were equipped with both a cargo and a targeting moiety in vitro. Overall, this study demonstrates that PVCs can be modularly functionalized with a variety of cargos (including protein, RNPs, ssDNA and multidomain cargos; Figs. 1c–g and 2a–f) and cell-type-specific binding proteins (including scFvs and mAbs; Fig. 2g–i and Extended Data Fig. 3), enabling target-specific delivery both in artificial mixed populations (Fig. 2j) and within live mice (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c). Due to the PVC's unique injection-based mechanism of action (Extended Data Fig. 1c), which is thought to operate independently of intrinsic cellular pathways for internalization or trafficking, this system is likely well suited for use in metabolically inactive or senescent cells or in nonhuman organisms that are difficult to target with existing tools (such as plants, fungi or prokaryotes). Together, these results establish SPEAR as a highly programmable chassis for biomolecular delivery with wide-ranging applications in biotechnology.

The wild-type PVCpnf locus was constructed previously13 and is publicly available as separate structural (pvc1–pvc16) and cargo/regulatory (Pdp1, Pnf and regulatory genes PAU_RS16570–PAU_RS24015) plasmids (Addgene, 198271 and 198272, respectively). Routine plasmid manipulations involved PCR amplification using KOD ONE polymerase (Sigma, KMM-101NV; 6-min extension time for structural plasmids and 2-min extension time for cargo/regulatory plasmids), assembly with Gibson Assembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs, E2611L) and either electroporation into EPI300 electrocompetent cells (Lucigen, EC300110; for structural plasmids) or transformation into chemically competent Stbl3 cells (Thermo Fisher, C737303; for cargo/regulatory plasmids). Novel designs were structurally validated with AlphaFold3 and visualized with PyMOL (2.5.2) and ChimeraX (1.8). A list of amino acid/DNA sequences for constructs used throughout this study can be found in Supplementary Tables 1–10.

PVC samples were obtained using a previous method3,13 with modifications. Briefly, one variant each of the PVC structural plasmid and cargo/regulatory plasmid were electroporated into EPI300 cells, after which colonies were inoculated into 5 ml of Terrific Broth (TB; US Biological, T2810) and shaken at 37 °C for 16 h. Starter cultures were then inoculated (at 1:100) in 500 ml of TB medium and shaken at 24 °C for an additional 48 h. Cultures were then spun for 25 min at 4,000g, resuspended in 22 ml of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5; Thermo Fisher, 15567027), 140 mM NaCl (AmericanBio, AB01915), 3 mM KCl (Sigma-Aldrich, P9541), 5 mM MgCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, M4880), 200 μg ml−1 lysozyme (Thermo Fisher, 89833), 50 μg ml−1 DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich, DN25), 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, 93443) and 1× Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (MedChem Express, HY-K0010)) and subsequently shaken at 37 °C for 60 min to promote lysis. Lysates were then pelleted at 5,000g for 30 min at room temperature (RT) to remove bulk cell lysate. Supernatants were then spun in an ultracentrifuge at 120,000g for 1 h at 4 °C to pellet PVC protein complexes. Pellets were hydrated overnight at 4 °C in 1 ml of PBS (Life Technologies, 10010049), resuspended and spun at 16,000g for 15 min at 16 °C to remove residual solid lysate. Supernatants were then applied to 22 ml of cold PBS before repeating the ultracentrifuge spin (120,000g for 1 h) and resuspending in 100–500 µl of cold PBS (with the final volume depending on pellet size). Final resuspensions were again clarified at 16,000g for 15 min at 16 °C, and PVC yields were quantified by A280 measurement on a NanoDrop instrument (Thermo Fisher). For mouse experiments, endotoxin was then removed from the final PVC samples using a detergent-based method used previously13. All PVC samples containing spike–cargo fusions were used immediately; all other PVCs were stored at 4 °C for a maximum of 2 weeks before use. Long-term storage of PVCs was achieved by adding 5% (final concentration) glycerol to the PVC suspension and storing at –80 °C without flash-freezing.

Several proteins used to functionalize PVCs in vitro (such as the Pvc10–Cas9RNP protein used in Fig. 2c and all cargo/targeting proteins used in Extended Data Fig. 5b) were purified in isolation of PVCs using affinity chromatography. Plasmids carrying the desired open reading frames with N-terminal affinity tags (6×His-TwinStrep-Sumo) were transformed into Rosetta 2 (DE3) cells (Sigma-Aldrich, 71401M). Each colony was inoculated into 10 ml of TB medium and grown at 37 °C for 14–18 h before being inoculated into an additional 500 ml of TB. Cultures were grown at 37 °C until they reached an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6–0.8, induced with 1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (GoldBio, I2481C) and subsequently allowed to grow at 18 °C for an additional 16–18 h. Cells were then collected via centrifugation at 4,000g for 30 min, resuspended in 15 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5; Thermo Fisher, 15567027), 280 mM NaCl (AmericanBio, AB01915), 3 mM KCl (Sigma-Aldrich, P9541), 5 mM MgCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, M4880), 20 mM imidazole (VWR, IC102033), 1× cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, 11836170001) and 50 µg ml−1 DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich, DN25); 0.004 U µl−1 SUPERase-In RNase Inhibitor (Thermo Fisher, AM2694) if purifying RNPs) and passed twice through a Microfluidics M110P microfluidizer. Lysates were then clarified at 19,000g for 20 min at 4 °C, after which they were incubated with 2 ml of 50% Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, 30210; pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer) with shaking for 1 h at 4 °C. Following incubation, Ni-NTA beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000g for 3 min at 4 °C, transferred to a column (Thermo Fisher, 29922), washed with 10 ml of cold lysis buffer, washed with 10 ml of cold wash buffer 1 (40 mM imidazole in PBS; Life Technologies, 10010049), washed with 10 ml of cold wash buffer 2 (60 mM imidazole in PBS) and finally eluted with 2 ml of cold elution buffer (250 mM imidazole in PBS) for 5 min. The elution was collected, suspended in excess cold PBS and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter unit (molecular weight cutoff of 10 kDa or 50 kDa; Sigma-Aldrich, UFC9050). Purified protein yield was quantified by measuring A280 on a NanoDrop instrument (Thermo Fisher). For cargos containing sgRNA, 1 U µl−1 SUPERase-In was also added to prevent RNase activity. To remove the 6×His-TwinStrep tag, purified proteins were treated with Ulp1 protease (a gift from S. Vo, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard) at 0.4 mg of Ulp1 per 1 mg of cargo at RT for 1.5 h.

Several proteins used to functionalize PVCs in vitro (such as the Pvc10 protein in Fig. 2b, the anti-MHC class II/anti-EGFR proteins in Fig. 2j and the Ad5–SC protein in Extended Data Fig. 3c,d) were expressed using an in vitro transcription/translation (IVTT) system. The desired open reading frames were synthesized as gBlocks (IDT) containing 5′ and 3′ extensions required for expression in a T7-based IVTT system (5′ T7 promoter and ribosome binding site; 3′ T7 terminator) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. gBlocks were enriched using PCR with NEBNext polymerase (New England Biolabs, M0541), and the resulting amplicons were purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, 28104) and eluted in distilled water. One microgram of each purified amplicon was then spiked into PURExpress reactions (New England Biolabs, E6800; 50 µl final volume) and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h to promote expression of the desired protein. These reactions were then used as raw inputs for in vitro complementation reactions (see ‘In vitro cargo complementation' and ‘In vitro retargeting' below).

To complement PVCs with spike–cargo fusion proteins in vitro, 150 µg of PVCs was incubated with either 15 µg of affinity-purified spike–cargo protein in a 50-µl reaction (in PBS) or with 50 µl of a raw IVTT reaction containing a spike–cargo protein; these reactions were incubated for 1–2 h at 24 °C. For cargos containing Cas9 RNPs, 1 U µl−1 SUPERase-In (final concentration) was also added before the addition of cargo. Reactions were then diluted to 100 µl with PBS and purified with 100 µl of a 50% slurry (in PBS) of Capto Core 700 resin (Cytiva, 17548101). Reactions were incubated with resin for 30 min at RT with rotation, after which they were transferred to a filter plate (Harvard Apparatus, 74-5650) and eluted by centrifugation at 1,500g for 3 min. An amino acid sequence for an engineered Pvc10 construct designed to load Cas9 onto PVCs can be found in Supplementary Table 1.

To load ssDNA cargos onto PVCs in vitro, 150 µg of PVCs (containing Pvc10–HUHe) was mixed with 10 pmol of DNA (containing an HUHe recognition sequence: AAGTATTACCAGC; synthesized by Azenta) in a 50-µl reaction in HUH buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 8), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM MnCl2), which was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to promote conjugation of HUHe to the DNA cargo. Protein–DNA conjugation reactions were then purified using Capto Core 700 pre-equilibrated with HUH buffer before DNA delivery experiments in live cells. An amino acid sequence for an engineered Pvc10 construct harboring HUHe, as well as a DNA sequence for a representative HUHe-specific ssDNA cargo, can be found in Supplementary Tables 6 and 7.

To alter PVC target specificity in vitro, 150 µg of PVCs was incubated with either 5 µg of affinity-purified SC/BG-labeled binding protein (purified as described in ‘Affinity purification of spike–cargo fusions and binding domain–SC fusions' or provided by B. Lash, M. Segel and D. Strebinger, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard) in a 50-µl reaction (in PBS) or with 50 µl of a raw IVTT reaction containing a binding domain–SC protein (see ‘In vitro expression of spike–cargo fusions and binding domain–SC fusions'); these reactions were incubated for 1 h at RT. Retargeted PVCs were then purified using Capto Core 700 (see ‘In vitro cargo complementation') before experiments in live cells. Amino acid/DNA sequences for an ST-functionalized PVC tail fiber (Pvc13–ST), a binding domain–SC protein used to retarget Pvc13–ST and a DNA amplicon used to express a binding domain–SC protein via IVTT can be found in Supplementary Tables 8–10.

Loading of cargo domains onto Pvc8/Pvc10 was verified using immunoblots. Ten micrograms of purified PVCs (containing spike–cargo fusion proteins) was mixed with NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Thermo Fisher, NP0008) and NuPAGE Sample Reducing Agent (Thermo Fisher, NP0009), both to a final concentration of 1×, and were subsequently boiled at 95 °C for 10 min. The denatured samples were then run on NuPAGE Bis-Tris 1–12% protein gels (Thermo Fisher, NP0321) for 20 min at 200 V in 1× MOPS buffer (Thermo Fisher, NP000102) and were blotted onto PVDF membranes using an iBlot 2 instrument (Thermo Fisher). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at RT in blocking buffer (5% BLOT-QuickBlocker (VWR, 786-011) in 1× TBS-T (Thermo Fisher, 28360)), stained for 1 h at RT with mouse anti-Flag (Sigma, F3165; diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer), washed three times with TBS-T (5 min each), stained for 30 min with anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling, 7076; diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer) and washed another three times with TBS-T (5 min each). Finally, membranes were incubated for 1 min with chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Fisher, 32209) and imaged with a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc instrument. For ssDNA loading experiments, the Cy3 channel was also imaged alongside chemiluminescence. Pvc12 was used as a loading control for immunoblots; this protein was visualized via the addition of a C-terminal Flag tag.

Loading of Cas9 onto the PVC spike complex was visualized using negative-stain TEM. Briefly, PVC samples were diluted to 100–500 ng µl−1 in PBS and applied to a glow-discharged 200-mesh carbon-coated copper TEM grid (VWR, 100489-722) for 60 s before removing excess liquid with a light-duty tissue wiper (VWR, 82003). Grids were then treated with clarified 2% uranyl formate stain (incubating with gentle agitation for 5 s, 5 s, 10 s, 20 s and 20 s on five separate 30-µl uranyl formate droplets positioned on Parafilm) and allowed to dry at RT. TEM imaging was performed using an FEI Tecnai (G2 Spirit TWIN) microscope at 120 kV equipped with a Gatan Orius SC1000B camera located in the MIT.nano Characterization Facilities at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

To confirm the presence of sgRNA in PVCs loaded with Cas9 RNPs, we performed quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT–qPCR). PVCs were standardized to a concentration of 1,000 ng µl−1 and denatured by mixing with NuPAGE Sample Reducing Agent (Thermo Fisher, NP0009; 1× final concentration) and boiling at 95 °C for 10 min. These denatured samples were then used to generate cDNA using ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase (New England Biolabs, M0368) and random primers (New England Biolabs, S1330), according to the manufacturer's protocol. We then ran qPCR on the resulting cDNAs using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher, 4385612) in a Bio-Rad CFX Opus 384 qPCR instrument. A list of RT–qPCR primers used during this study can be found in Supplementary Table 11.

All cell lines were maintained in T75 flasks (Thermo Fisher, 156499) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in either DMEM-GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher, 10569044; for HEK293FT and A431 cells) or RPMI-GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher, 61870127; for A549 and A20 cells). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (VWR, 97068-085) along with 10 µg ml−1 gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich, G1397) and 1× penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher, 15140122) to prevent bacterial growth. A list of cell lines used in this study can be found in Supplementary Table 12.

To assess the activity of PVCs in live cells, we first seeded target cells into clear-bottom, 96-well plates (VWR, 89091-012) and allowed them to grow to ~80% confluence. A total of 7.5 µg of purified PVCs (into 100 µl of cell culture medium) was then added to each well. For some experiments, improved efficiency was observed if this dose was spaced over 3 days (2.5 µg per day). For experiments involving co-transfection, DNA was transfected using GeneJuice Transfection Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, 70967) either immediately after adding PVCs (for Cre reporter plasmids) or 6 h before adding PVCs (for Cas9/sgRNA or bdSENP1 plasmids; these transfections were followed by a medium exchange before adding PVCs). For ssODN delivery experiments, 1 µM (final concentration) Alt-R HDR enhancer V2 (IDT, 10007921) was also added alongside PVCs to promote HDR-mediated repair. For toxin delivery experiments, cytotoxicity was assessed using CellTiter-Glo 2.0 Cell Viability Assay (Promega, G9241) 24 h after adding PVCs; any wells exhibiting higher luminescence than the control well (PBS) were assigned a cytotoxicity value of 0% to avoid negative cytotoxicity. For assays involving Cre-driven GFP expression, cells were incubated for 3 days, imaged with a Leica DMi8 confocal microscope and analyzed by flow cytometry (see ‘Flow cytometry'). For gene editing experiments, cells were incubated for 4 days, genomic DNA was extracted with 50 µl of QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution (Lucigen, QE09050), and indels/base substitutions were quantified by next-generation sequencing (see ‘Deep sequencing'). All numerical data from the PVC experiments were plotted with Prism (10.2.2), and figures were graphically assembled in Adobe Illustrator (27.1.1).

Cells were first collected by incubation with 30 µl of TrypLE Express dissociation reagent (Thermo Fisher, 12604) for 5 min at RT, followed by resuspension with 50 µl of cold flow cytometry buffer (PBS supplemented with 2% EDTA (Life Technologies, 15575020) and 5% fetal bovine serum (VWR, 97068-085)). Samples were then run on a Beckman Coulter Cytoflex S flow cytometer, and analysis was performed using FlowJo (10.8.2).

To assess the target specificity of in vitro-retargeted PVCs (Fig. 2j), we instead used a modified protocol involving cocultures of two cell lines. Briefly, an approximately 1:1 mixture of A431 and A20 cells (1 × 106 cells each) was seeded into 2 ml of RPMI-GlutaMAX (with supplements listed in ‘Cell culture') in six-well, flat-bottom plates (VWR, 29442), 150 µg of in vitro-retargeted PVCs was added, and the cultures were allowed to grow for 48 h. The supernatants (containing suspension cells) were then collected and combined with adherent cells (collected in a similar manner as detailed in ‘Flow cytometry'), pelleted at 300g for 5 min, resuspended in 500 µl of fresh flow cytometry buffer to remove residual TrypLE reagent, immunostained with anti-mouse CD19–Alexa Fluor 700 (Thermo Fisher, 56-0193-82; 1:100 dilution) at RT for 30 min in the dark, washed with blank flow cytometry buffer three times and analyzed on a Beckman Coulter Cytoflex S flow cytometer. The flow cytometry gating scheme used during this experiment can be found in Extended Data Fig. 3g.

We used deep sequencing to detect PVC-mediated delivery of gene editing systems (Cas9 and ZFDs). We first amplified the desired target region out of each genomic DNA extract using NEBNext (New England Biolabs, M0541) and subsequently barcoded the resulting amplicons with indexed Illumina P5 and P7 next-generation sequencing primers. Libraries were purified with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, 28104), quantified on a NanoDrop instrument (Thermo Fisher) and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument. Indels/base substitutions were then quantified with Geneious Prime (2020.0.5). A list of primers used for deep sequencing can be found in Supplementary Table 13.

All experiments in mice conformed to guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health and were conducted under Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol 0017-09-14-3, approved by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Animals were chosen randomly for treatment with either control or experimental conditions without blinding. Female C57BL/6J mice (aged 8–12 weeks) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (strain 000664). All mice were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. A total of 100 µl per mouse at 1.2 µg µl−1 of either MHC class II-targeting or untargeted PVC in sterile 0.9% NaCl was injected intravenously. Animals were deeply anaesthetized 24 h after injection with CO2, and spleens of PVC-injected mice were extracted. Single-cell suspensions were generated by mashing through 100- and 70-µm cell strainers (Greiner One-Bio, 542000 and 542070) and repeated washing with PBS. Splenocyte samples were blocked with 1:50 TruStain FcX (anti-mouse CD16/CD32) reagent (BioLegend, 101320) before antibody staining for flow cytometry and stained with fixable viability dye eFluor780 (1:1,000 dilution; Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-mouse CD45-eFluor450 (1:100 dilution; BioLegend), anti-mouse CD3-FITC (1:100 dilution; BioLegend), anti-mouse CD19-APC (1:100 dilution; BioLegend), anti-mouse CD11b-PE-Cy7 (1:100 dilution; BioLegend) and anti-mouse IA/IE (MHC class II)-PE (1:100 dilution; BioLegend) at 4 °C for 30 min. Flow cytometry was performed on a Beckman Coulter CytoFlex S device with standard laser and detector configuration, and data were analyzed using FlowJo 10.8.1 software.

To assess whether mice mount a neutralizing immune response against PVCs following systemic injection, we used a serum neutralization assay. Briefly, we injected mice with either PBS (mock injection) or MHC class II-targeting PVCs (intravenously as described in ‘In vivo B cell depletion assay'), repeated the injections in one cohort at t = 7 days (to amplify the generation of neutralization antibodies), extracted serum for all cohorts at t = 14 days via submandibular bleed, incubated clarified serum with similar MHC class II-targeting PVCs (5% (vol/vol) serum and 15 µg of PVCs in each 100-µl reaction, diluted in PBS) for 1 h at RT and titrated the resulting PVC/serum mixtures on MHC class II+ cells (A20). Cytotoxicity was assessed as described in ‘Live-cell experiments with PVCs'.

All statistical analyses were performed in Prism (10.2.2). All quantitative data are presented as mean ± s.d. with n = 5 biological replicates per condition; biological replicates represent independent treatments in separate culture wells or mice. All images and blots are representative examples from n = 3 independent experiments. Statistical significance was computed using two-sided unpaired Student's t-test or one-way ANOVA, followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test (to correct for multiple comparisons), as indicated in the figure legends.

a, The wildtype PVCpnf locus—consisting of 2 spike genes (the spike (pvc8) and spike tip (pvc10), in blue) and 2 cargo genes (Pdp1 and Pnf, in orange)—was redesigned to generate PVCs which load cargo via the spike complex. Pdp1 and Pnf were deleted, and novel cargo domains were fused to either pvc8 or pvc10. b, AlphaFold3 predicted structures of engineered Pvc8/Pvc10-cargo fusions share similarity with similar complexes from T6SSs. The spike-cargo effector from T6SSTse6 (PDB: 4MTK/1TU114) was used as a reference. GFP was used as the cargo domain in AlphaFold queries for novel spike-cargo designs. Note that Pvc8 assembles as a trimer; thus, three cargo domains are present in Pvc8-cargo designs. c, Proposed mechanism of spike-mediated cargo delivery in human cells. PVCs harboring cargos fused to the spike complex (Pvc8/Pvc10) recognize target cells via the tail fiber (Pvc13), initiating a series of conformational changes which result in translocation of the spike—along with cargo domains tethered to the spike—across the membrane. d, PVCs can load exogenous cargos via Pvc10. Four arbitrary proteins (Cre, GFP, a nanobody (Nb), and a DARPin) were fused to the C-terminus of the spike tip (Pvc10), and loading was assessed using immunoblot on purified PVC complexes. Novel domains were only present in purified PVC samples when fused to Pvc10, indicating Pvc10 mediated loading of these domains onto the PVC complex. Baseplate (Pvc12) served as a loading control. e, Characterization of loading efficiency for novel spike-cargo designs. PVCs loaded with Cas9 were imaged with TEM (as in Fig. 1c) and the proportion of loaded particles were quantified (n = 250 for each design). Ambiguous particles were counted as unloaded. Zoomed-out images provided as context for the images in Fig. 1c. Scale bar, 100 nm. f, The RT–qPCR analysis from Fig. 1d plotted on a linear scale reveals differences in gRNA loading consistent with the observed variability of Cas9 loading from (e). Compared to the N-terminal Pvc10 fusion (Cas9-Pvc10), the C-terminal Pvc10 fusion (Pvc10-Cas9)—which also loads RNPs more efficiently—correspondingly loads more gRNA. The dual-Cas9 fusion (Cas9-Pvc10-Cas9) and Pvc8 fusion (Pvc8-Cas9) load the most gRNA, likely due to these designs harboring multiple Cas9 monomers per loaded PVC particle. g, Pvc8-mediated delivery of Cas9 requires the presence of Pvc10. Δpvc10 PVCs harboring Pvc8-Cas9 failed to produce indels in HEK293FT cells, indicating a functional spike complex is necessary for delivery of Cas9 in these particles. h, PVC-mediated delivery is dependent on sheath contraction. PVC-mediated delivery of Cas9 RNPs (as in Fig. 1e, f) was inhibited with PVCs harboring 5aa insertions in the sheath (Pvc2) previously shown to inhibit sheath contraction in other CISs32,33. See Supplementary Tables 4 and 5 for amino acid sequences of novel mutants. N.c., non-contractile. i, Longterm storage of PVCs. Tube-loaded PVCs (loaded with endogenous toxins Pdp1 and Pnf13; left) or spike-loaded PVCs (loaded with ZFDs, as in Fig. 1g; right) were frozen at -80 °C for 23 months and 12 months, respectively, and were subsequently incubated with HEK293FT cells to determine the effect of storage on cytotoxicity or base editing efficiency, respectively. Successful storage required the presence of 5% glycerol (v/v). All values (f–i) are mean ± s.d. with n = 5 biological replicates. Statistical significance was computed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test (f, h, i) or two-sided Student's t-test (g); ****P < 0.0001.

Source data

a, Pvc10-cargo fusion proteins self-associate with Δpvc10 PVCs in vitro. Pvc10 alone or with a cargo (GFP) were incubated with PVCs lacking Pvc10, purified using ultracentrifugation, and visualized with an immunoblot. Only intact Pvc10 or Pvc10-GFP successfully purified with the PVC complex after the complementation reaction; –Pvc10 variants of both (harboring a scrambled Pvc10 sequence) failed to purify. All proteins were tagged with FLAG; bands were visualized with anti-FLAG immunoblot. Baseplate (Pvc12) served as a loading control. b, ssODNs can be loaded onto the PVC spike tip in vitro. ssODNs (labeled with Cy3) were titrated against PVCs containing Pvc10-HUHe (tagged with FLAG), and protein-DNA conjugation was assessed using a dual Cy3/FLAG blot. Only ssODNs containing the 13-nt HUHe recognition sequence produced an increase in molecular weight in both the DNA and protein bands, indicating these species became covalently linked.

Source data

a, AlphaFold3 predicted structures of Pvc13-ST (grey) docked with various binding domain-SC designs (blue). Note that Pvc13 forms a trimer; therefore, three Pvc13-ST monomers and three binding domain-SC monomers were queried for each design. b, Pvc13 can be covalently linked with a novel binding domain using ST/SC. A DARPin fused to SC (DARPin-SC; tagged with FLAG) was incubated with PVCs harboring Pvc13-ST, and assembly of the DARPin/Pvc13 complex was assessed using anti-FLAG immunoblot. Assembly required both ST and SC in Pvc13 and the DARPin, respectively. Additionally, only the assembled DARPin-Pvc13 conjugate was retained in purified PVC fractions, indicating it was physically associated with the PVC complex. c, d, PVCs retargeted in vitro are active in human cells. PVCs loaded with Cre via Pdp1 (NTD) were retargeted with Ad5 knob domains in vitro (as was done with a DARPin in (b)) and exposed to HEK293FT cells co-transfected with a Cre reporter plasmid (loxP-GFP). Only particles resulting from an in vitro complementation reaction involving both ST and SC produced GFP activity. Images in (c); replicate data in (d). Scale bar, 200 μm. e, f, Individual validation of the retargeting moieties used in Fig. 2j. In addition to the Ad5 knob-SC used in (c, d), the anti-EGFR DARPin E01 (DARPinαEGFR-SC) (e) enabled PVC activity in EGFR+ cells (A431) and an anti-mouse MHC-II nanobody (NbαMHCII-SC) (f) enabled PVC activity in MHC-II+ cells (A20). In these experiments, we used Pvc13-ST PVCs loaded with toxins; PVC-mediated delivery was detected as cytotoxicity. g, Flow cytometry gating scheme for the co-culture experiment in Fig. 2j. All values (d–f) are mean ± s.d. with n = 5 biological replicates. Statistical significance was computed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; ****P < 0.0001.

Source data

a, Schematic and flow cytometry workflow for in vivo studies of reprogrammed PVCs. Endogenous toxin-loaded PVCs retargeted against mouse MHC-II via ST/SC-based in vitro retargeting (as in Fig. 2j) were injected into mice (i.v.) and splenocytes were subsequently analyzed for targeted depletion of MHC-II positive cells. b, MHC-II-targeting PVCs selectively inhibit MHC-II positive cells in vivo. PVCs injected into mice as in (a) produced specific cytotoxicity against the MHC-II+ cell population, including B cells, without significant reduction in the total cell population (CD45+) or depletion of off-target populations (myeloid APCs and T cells). c, PVC injections alter the cellular composition of the mouse spleen. Systemic treatment with MHC-II-targeting PVCs (a, b) reduced the total B cell population in the spleen by about 7% after 24 h. d, PVC injections result in minor neutralizing immunity. Serum from mice challenged with a mock injection (PBS), one PVC injection, or two PVC injections (at t = 0 and 7 days) were extracted at t = 14 days and incubated with equivalent MHC-II targeting PVCs to determine the effect of serum on PVC activity in MHC-II positive cells (A20). PVCs incubated with serum from mice challenged with two PVC doses exhibited a roughly 30% decrease in potency (IC50) compared to PVCs incubated with mock serum. All values are mean ± s.d. with n = 4 biological replicates. Statistical significance was computed using two-sided Student's t-test; ****P < 0.0001; ***P < 0.001; *P < 0.05; n.s., not significant.

Source data

a, Proposed model of dual-functionalization of PVCs via spike engineering and retargeting (SPEAR). Δpvc10 PVCs harboring Pvc13-ST were incubated with separately purified cargo (as in Fig. 2a–c) and targeting protein (as in Fig. 2g–i), yielding PVC complexes programmed to deliver defined molecular cargos into defined target cells. b, PVCs can be both loaded and retargeted in vitro. Indels were observed only when the cargo (Cas9 RNPs) contained Pvc10 and when the targeting protein (Ad5 knob) contained SC, indicating two separate functionalization steps occurred. All values are mean ± s.d. with n = 5 biological replicates. Statistical significance was computed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; ****P < 0.0001.

In July 2021, the River Meuse flooded catastrophically in the Netherlands and Belgium, killing 43 people and causing billions of dollars of damage to the local infrastructure. The severity of the flooding was unexpected because the river was considered safe after the implementation of a major flood-management programme, which involved widening the river corridor. Writing in Nature, Barneveld et al.1 report an analysis of the flood. They argue that a combination of uneven river widening and the specific characteristics of the riverbed triggered rapid changes in river morphology (the shape of the river channel) during the inundation. As a result, the effects of the flood were worse than they would have been had the river not been widened.

In vivo CRISPR screens in CD8+ T cells have previously uncovered targets for cancer immunotherapy; however, a minority of the genome has been individually annotated, suggesting that additional regulators remain to be discovered. Here we assessed 899 genes in CD8+ T cells responding to murine melanoma and identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1 as a new negative regulator of anti-tumor CD8+ T cell function. We demonstrated that Stub1 knockout CD8+ T cells effectively control tumor growth across multiple murine models. Mechanistically, STUB1 interacts with the adapter protein CHIC2 to regulate cytokine receptor expression in mouse and human CD8+ T cells. Among the regulated cytokine receptors, interleukin-27 receptor α is essential for tumor growth control mediated by Stub1/Chic2 knockout CD8+ T cells. Together, these findings establish the STUB1–CHIC2 complex as a regulator of cytokine receptor expression in CD8+ T cells and provide rationale for inhibiting this pathway to enhance CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity.

A group of Americans are building a “whites only” community in rural Arkansas they call the Return to the Land. They believe that white people and Western culture are facing extinction due to an influx of immigrants and minorities, and according to the group's founder, access to the community is open only to people of white European ancestry who share common views on topics such as segregation, abortion, and gender identity.

Video footage shared by the group on its social media accounts show a bucolic setting with animals and children running around their 160-acre site, while members of the community build timber-frame homes, churches, and other facilities. A “few dozen” people are already living there full time, says Eric Orwoll, the group's president.

Though the organization claims that Return to the Land is nothing more than a peaceful settlement of like-minded people, the online histories of the group's leaders tell a different story. Members have espoused virulently racist and antisemitic views and repeatedly praised Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party. One of the leaders says he is currently under criminal investigation in Ecuador. Orwoll himself has spoken about the coming of a second Hitler and praised KKK leader David Duke. He is also closely aligned to an international network of far-right influencers, extremists, and white supremacists, including Thomas Sewell, a neo-Nazi living in Australia who was the founder of a group that influenced the Christchurch, New Zealand, shooter.

Despite this, the Return to the Land community has been lauded by far-right influencers and has already raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations.

Return to the Land, which was first reported on by The Forward and Sky News, is actively scouting for other locations to create a network of similar communities across the country, with a development in Missouri apparently in the works. Inspired in part by the Silicon Valley-based concept of the “network state” and by a white separatist community in South Africa known as Orania, the group promotes itself on its website as a community designed to “promote strong families with common ancestry, and raise the next generation in an environment that reflects our traditional values.”

“They use a lot of innocuous language,” Morgan Moon, a researcher at the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, tells WIRED. “Instead of saying they want to make a white ethnic community, they say they want to make a strong community of common ancestry. But at the same time, when we see their promotional videos and propaganda, what we see is that when they're depicting the failing modern society, they use imagery consisting of minority groups or the LGBT+ community. When they're showing the idealized parallel society that they're attempting to create with Return to the Land, they tend to only use white Aryan imagery.”

Orwoll has spent years building up an audience of like-minded followers on social media, primarily on YouTube, where he speaks about Western culture and philosophy.

In 2023, a group of Orwoll's followers decided to buy the 160-acre plot in rural Arkansas. They chose the location because Orwoll lives nearby, the property was relatively cheap, and the building regulations were lenient. The county is over 90 percent white, which was also a deciding factor, says Orwoll, who also claims to be a classically trained musician who previously played with Shen Yun, a Chinese performing arts group run by the Falun Gong, a religious movement.

Return to the Land is set up as a private members association, and those seeking to join have to go through a number of steps in order to verify their identity and heritage.

“You fill out a questionnaire that'll give us an initial idea of where you're coming from, your values, who you are, your background and then there is a phone interview, and we make admissions decisions on a case by case basis,” Orwoll tells WIRED.

The application form for Return to the Land asks potential members to outline their ancestry and also respond to a range of questions about their social and cultural viewpoints, including whether they support foreign immigration, “transgenderism,” Covid-19 vaccines, and segregation. It also asks: “How often do you think about the Roman empire?” with answers ranging from “every day, at least once” to “a few times a week, probably” and “never.” This initial process only gets you approved to access private group chats on Telegram. For those who decide they want to move to Arkansas and become part of the community, “vetting for that level of involvement is much more thorough,” says Orwoll, though he declined to say what that process involved beyond conducting a “background check.”

Peter Csere, the group's secretary, tells WIRED that the association has 300 members across the country. Orwoll says they have had interest not only from Americans but also from people on other continents.

Despite being the face of the development, Orwoll does not live in the Return to the Land community. “I've not developed my homestead sufficiently to allow my four children to live safely there full time, so I have a house 15 minutes away, but I'm working towards moving into the community,” he says. In recent weeks, as Orwoll's past has been closely scrutinized, researchers found videos in which Orwoll performed in online porn videos with his then wife Caitlyn, who is now a resident on the Return to the Land compound. Orwoll has condemned porn addiction, claiming that it “emasculated” young men.

“In my early twenties I did plenty of things that I am now totally against,” says Orwoll, who confirmed on X that he appeared in the videos. “I considered myself a nihilist, did psychedelics, and didn't respect traditional sexual morality. The lack of guidance I had and the way it threw off my early adult life informed the importance I later placed on traditional values.”

To date, the community has raised approximately $330,000 from land sales, according to a financial analysis conducted by the ADL's Center on Extremism. It is also running five separate crowdfunding campaigns on GiveSendGo, a Christian-focused crowdfunding platform. These campaigns have raised over $185,000 in donations. The latest campaign, which has a target of $100,000, was launched last month and is designed to fund rallies across the country to promote the Return to the Land model. The campaign has already raised over $88,000; one of the top donations was for $5,000, to which the donor appended the white supremacist “14 words” slogan. Orwoll says that all of this funding has allowed him to quit his job and work full time traveling around the US speaking about the project.

One of the fundraising campaigns was specifically launched to help fund a legal defense that Orwoll believes may eventually be necessary. “I would prefer not to be sued, but I recognize that it probably will happen, and the upside of it happening is that, should we win, case law would be decided in our favor,” Orwoll says.

While the Fair Housing Act of 1968 prevents housing discrimination based on race or religion, Orwoll believes that the structure of his group as a private member association will allow him to circumvent the law. The group has raised over $63,000 from supporters for what it calls “legal framework research.”

“The attorneys that we've consulted with believe that what we're doing is legal,” Orwoll says. “I think it is a debatable edge case, probably, but we believe it is legal.” When asked to provide the names of the legal experts who they are working with, Orwoll declined to divulge their identities.

Arkansas attorney general Tim Griffin tells WIRED his office has found nothing illegal about the community. “Racism has no place in a free society, but from a legal perspective, we have not seen anything that would indicate any state or federal laws have been broken,” Griffin says in a statement emailed to WIRED.

A spokesperson for Shannon Smith, assistant US attorney in the Eastern District of Arkansas, declined to comment on whether her office is investigating the situation. WIRED has learned, however, that her office has referred the matter to the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice. “They are better equipped to handle allegations such as these,” Smith wrote in an email shared with WIRED. The DOJ declined to comment on the situation.

Multiple civil rights organizations have condemned Return to the Land's project and called on local and federal lawmakers and officials to shut down the project.

“We believe this development not only revives discredited and reprehensible forms of segregation,” Lindsay Baach Friedmann, a regional director at the ADL, wrote in a statement posted on X. “We urge the Arkansas Fair Housing Commission, local elected officials, and law enforcement to act swiftly to ensure that Northeast Arkansas remains a welcoming and inclusive community, not a refuge for intolerance and exclusion.”

The Arkansas Fair Housing Commission and Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not respond to WIRED's repeated requests for comment.

The idea of Return to the Land was partly inspired by venture capitalist Balaji Srinivasan's book The Network State, which promotes the idea of digital-first communities of people with shared values with the aim of gaining a degree of sovereignty. “That book was one inspiration,” Orwoll says. “I wouldn't say we're trying to emulate everything that Srinivasan writes about in the book, the more techno, crypto, and augmented-reality aspects that he discussed doesn't exactly align with our values, but the core concepts of how to organize the network state, I think, were very useful, actually.” Orwoll posted about the book in the group's Telegram channel earlier this year, urging others to read it.

“Imagine a network of a dozen high tech, high human capital, small White cities spread through the US south, exchanging workers, students and ideas,” Orwoll wrote on X in February.

The Return to the Land community has also been hailed as a huge success by far-right influencers and extremists on social media. “If you don't have the right to build a community on a private piece of land and live around the sorts of people you want to live around, then you don't have any rights at all,” right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh wrote on X about Return to the Land. “This is as basic and fundamental as rights can possibly get. Freedom of association.“

Many of the very people who have been most vocal in supporting Orwoll and his project are the same extremists who he has forged close relationships with in recent years.

Orwoll has long associated with white supremacists and promoted neo-Nazi ideals. Last year, Orwoll was a “VIP” guest at the America First Political Action Conference, an annual white nationalist gathering run by Nick Fuentes. “I have always considered you a brilliant and dedicated advocate for our cause,” Fuentes wrote on X recently in response to a post from Orwoll. When asked if Fuentes would be allowed to live within the compound, given his Mexican heritage, Orwoll tells WIRED “it would depend on a vote.”

Earlier this year, Orwoll invited Sewell, the well-known Australian neo-Nazi, to be a speaker at a conference dedicated to discussing intentional communities. Jared Taylor, who runs the white supremacist American Renaissance website, antisemitic influencer Lucas Gage, and Thomas Rousseau, the leader of white nationalist group Patriot Front, were also speaking at that conference. Rousseau has been interviewed by Orwoll on his social media channels on multiple occasions.

Moon says that she has also observed active clubs—many of which are run by Rousseau—taking part in events on the Return to the Land plot in Arkansas. Active clubs are a network of white supremacist groups who participate in physical training, preparing members for a war they believe they are fighting against a system designed to bring down the white race.

In a post on X last year, Orwoll wrote that “what really matters isn't which biological race you belong to or what your ethnic background is. What matters is what proportion of admixture you have from the ancient and spiritually superior root races.” In a follow-up post, he said that anyone who disagrees with the statement needs some “ahnenerbe” teaching.

Ahnenerbe was a pseudoscientific organization created by Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS in Adolf Hiter's Nazi Germany. The group consisted of scientists and academics charged with proving that Germans descended from an Aryan race that was responsible for most of the world's greatest achievements in everything from agriculture to art and literature.

Orwoll has also recently reminisced about a period in history when, as he portrayed it, former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke was almost elected as governor of Louisiana, and “White Pride rallies … filled stadiums.”

When asked recently about his comments regarding the arrival of a second Hitler, Orwoll said that the Nazi Party leader was “a very controversial historical figure.”

“I'm not saying you're going to have to wait for a new person to start a new Holocaust,” Orwoll told Sky News. “I am saying you are going to wait for a charismatic leader who is going to advocate for your interests, because that's how a lot of people see Hitler.""

A deeply antisemitic, anonymous X account with the screen name Raven Resolve has repeatedly referred to themselves as part of the Return to the Land group. As well as promoting the movement on numerous occasions, the account has also claimed that Return to the Land is “forming a nationwide army of future warriors.” In the past, the account has said that the American government is the enemy. “The people who rule this country hate it and its people,” the account wrote in 2023. “It's a similar screen name to one of our member's screen names on our internal chats,” Orwoll wrote in an email to WIRED, without officially confirming that Raven Resolve was part of Return to the Land. “If it is him: Views expressed by our members don't necessarily represent the views of RTTL,” Orwoll added. “We have a program for authorizing someone as a representative, and if that X account is one of our members, he's not been authorized to represent us.”

Csere, the group's secretary, who has repeatedly referred in social media posts to Nazis as “based,” tells WIRED that he was merely “trolling leftists.” When asked what his real view of Nazis is, Csere said: “The Nazis made a lot of politically conservative reforms that were popular among the German people, however, their method of dealing with foreign influence in German politics and society ended up backfiring.”

Csere is also facing allegations of financial fraud related to his departure from a vegan ecovillage he was part of in Ecuador. The group has accused Csere of owing the project $29,000 and stealing $30,000 in cryptocurrency. Csere denies the allegations, telling WIRED that “various owners of that former community owed me large amounts of money and did not pay it back.” He also says he has been prevented from selling land he owned in the development.

It isn't just allegations of financial impropriety, either: Csere is under criminal investigation in Ecuador for stabbing a local miner. “My attorney says that he has never seen a case of clear-cut self defense where the prosecutor tried so hard to press charges, for so long,” Csere says, adding that the investigation is still active.

Ultimately, Orwoll and Return to the Land have also been emboldened by an administration they believe offer the best chance at making this project work.

“Right now we have the most favorable judiciary,” Orwoll said in a recent video posted on X. “We have the most favorable cultural climate and administration that we're going to get. I can't imagine someone a lot better than Trump being elected next time. I mean, I can imagine it, it's just not a realistic scenario. So we have a limited amount of time where we need to fight battles.”

Trump's second term has been marked by hardline immigration policies, including a massive uptick in Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, the construction of draconian detention centers, and the embrace of the idea of “remigration,” a far-right European plan to expel minorities and immigrants from Western nations.

“The first thing that the Trump administration really did when it got in power was go after diversity programs and start attacking civil rights,” Chuck Tanner, a researcher for the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, tells WIRED. “Groups like [Orwoll's] are attuned to that and want to use that to insulate themselves from prosecution or investigation for setting up deeply racist secessionist kinds of communities.”

A piece of advice if you're meeting with Lisa Su: Wear sneakers.

Su, the leader of AMD, moves fast these days, though I suspect that's always been the case. Her company's chips underpin the artificial intelligence that's changing the world at breakneck speeds. To hear Su and literally everyone else in semiconductors talk about it, the US is in an AI race with China—and the rules keep changing. The Trump administration has once again shifted its stance on what kind of chips can and can't be shipped to China, with the latest decree being that the US will take a 15 percent cut of AMD and Nvidia chip sales to China. Meanwhile, on the home front, Su has claimed that AMD's newest AI chips can outperform Nvidia's—part of her strategy to keep eroding Nvidia's dominance in the market.

So, yeah: Be ready to keep up.

Under Lisa Su, the stalwart American semiconductor company has reasserted itself as a force in the age of AI. “Reasserted” doesn't do it justice: Su took a struggling AMD and executed a 10-year turnaround that has been, as one economist put it, nothing short of remarkable. Since 2014, when Su took over as CEO, AMD's market cap has risen from around $2 billion to nearly $300 billion.

Aside from her well-known bona fides, Su herself—what drives her, what inspires her, what irritates her, where her politics lie—is less known. This is what I was hoping to learn when I visited AMD's offices and labs in the hills of Austin, Texas, on a day in late June when the wind seemed to do little more than push heat around.

Our conversation kicked off with China, which accounts for nearly a quarter of AMD's business. She betrayed no anxiety. Su now travels frequently to Washington, DC, to grease the wheels. “We've come to realize that export controls are a bit of a fact of life,” she told me, “just given how critical the chips that we make are.” In other words, it's precisely because AMD's chips are so darn important—to national security, to national economies—that they're now at the heart of modern statecraft.

Another thing I learned about Su: She plays the long game. Politics is a cakewalk compared to what she's managed to pull off professionally.

Su was born in Taiwan in 1969 and raised in Queens, New York. Her father worked for the city as a statistician; her mother was an accountant who became an entrepreneur in her mid-forties. Su earned a doctoral degree in electrical engineering from MIT, then went on to stints at Texas Instruments, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor, where she served in executive roles. After joining AMD in 2012, she quickly rose to COO. As Su tells it, six months in, the chairman of the board called her and said, “It's time, Lisa.” Su's response: “Really? That seems kinda quick.”

As CEO, Su smartly steered AMD toward the high-performance computing market. She embraced chiplets, a modular approach to building chips that has paid off enormously. She impressed the industry by launching the world's first 7-nanometer data center GPUs. More recently, she doubled AMD's data center revenue in two years. And she has struck deals with juggernauts like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and a couple of Elon Musk's companies. During a keynote speech at AMD's annual event this June, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman trotted onto the stage to hug it out with Su.

These are all impressive data points. Yet AMD is still a fraction of the size of its most notorious competitor, the $4.4 trillion Nvidia. Comparisons between the two companies are inevitable—especially since Su is distant cousins with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. (I was warned that Su hates being asked about this. I asked anyway.)

During my visit to Austin, Su led me on a tour of AMD's test labs, where rows of server racks are rigged up to be put through the extremes. Engineers straightened up when Su paused at their stations. One of them surprised her with a celebratory cake in the shape of AMD's EPYC Venice processor. Su appeared genuinely delighted. She posed for a photograph, then moved on to the next row in the lab, striding with purpose in white Prada sneakers. Along the way I fired questions at her, raising my voice to be heard above the din. What do models like DeepSeek mean for her business? Will AMD build its own LLMs? What drives Lisa Su?

Later on, Su invited me to join her in her chauffeured car. (Alas, it was not one of her Porsches, which have license plates bearing the names of her favorite AMD chips.) The noise was gone; the walls were down. During the nearly 30-minute drive to the next lab, Su pressed me on my thoughts on AI, called out my skepticism, and shared why powering the AI revolution—particularly around health care—is personal to her.

What is something that you would hope that the Trump administration—but also the general public—would understand about the AI accelerators that you're making?

That we, as tech companies, benefit from more users. And limiting the number of users in our ecosystem is actually bad, not just for AMD but really for the US. Because there will be alternatives out there. The idea that somehow, if we don't ship chips to the rest of the world, that AI progress is going to stop—it's not going to stop. AI progress is going to continue to develop, and we'd rather them develop on us than on someone else.

There have been incentives recently to bring more chipmaking back to the US. What's the most complicated part of bringing that manufacturing back?

We absolutely should bring manufacturing back to the US. Absolutely, 100 percent.

Why is that?

Because it is such a critical part of national security and the economic interests. We had an ice storm here in the central Texas area a couple of years ago. For days nothing could move around. A couple of fabs around here were shut down. For good business practice, you want diversity.

To bring manufacturing back will take time. But it's doable. The thinking went from “Oh, you can't do leading-edge manufacturing in the US” to today, how in TSMC's Arizona fab we're running some of our latest server processors, and it's looking really good. So it can be done. It is more expensive, and that's OK, too. I think it requires a change of mentality, that you don't always go for the lowest-cost thing.

When you became president and CEO of AMD in 2014, did you think that folks like yourself would be expected to weigh in so much on what's going on in terms of geopolitical and social issues? Do you feel more pressure to participate in conversations with the current administration?

Well, it certainly has changed. I wouldn't say that we're political or I'm political. You won't see me weighing in on general social issues, because I don't necessarily think that that's where my value-add is. But when it comes to technology policy and where semiconductors are in the world, yes, we have to participate. And I wouldn't call it increasing pressure. I would call it an increasing responsibility to do so, because we want the rules to be written right.

You're one of the most prominent women leaders in technology, in semiconductors. Why don't you think you add value?

Maybe value-add is not the right way to state it. It's more like, my personal opinion might be interesting, but frankly, it's much more important that we get the policy correct, based on what I consider facts.

Your least favorite question these days is probably “When?” Meaning, when might AMD surpass Nvidia in the AI GPU market? My guess is that 10 years ago people might've laughed at the idea, and now they might be more willing to entertain it.

When I started as CEO, people would ask me, “Why are you taking this job?” and I would be very confused. I was like, “Are you kidding me?” To me, it was the best. We were a company in an industry that really matters that had been underperforming for a while, and I had a chance to take this team and do something which I felt was important. If you asked me, “What do I want to be when I grow up?” it was not “I want to be a CEO,” it was “I want to work on something that matters.”

At that time, everyone was comparing us to Intel, and we would have to defend that. And my comments to the team are, “Look, we know what we can do, and let's just show the world what we can do.” And so I mean, this notion of when, I don't love this. I know the media loves this. It's always A versus B, is that right? That's what you guys—

I wouldn't say it's A versus B. I mean, I think AMD is more nuanced in some ways, because you still have so many clients and customers who are reliant on x86 and CPUs. And you have this fast-growing data center business, which you grew from $6 billion in 2022 to $12.6 billion last year. But Nvidia is the big question right now.

Look, my point is I don't necessarily want to be compared against Intel or Nvidia. My vision, our vision, has always been, “There's no one-size-fits-all.” You need the best in the data center. You need the best CPUs. You need the best AI accelerators. You need the best in your personal computing. We have this portfolio that is quite broad, and the market is humongous. It's more than $500 billion over the next three to four years. We have plenty of opportunities.

So, Sam Altman was at your AMD AI event in June, and you talked about working with OpenAI. You're working with Meta. You're working with Elon Musk's companies, Tesla and xAI. But the reality with AMD is that companies like that love their Nvidia GPUs, and you're an “also.” Do you want to get to the point where you're like, “No, we are the primary partner?”

Of course. That's where we are today in CPUs. So if you were to ask many of those same companies, I think they would say that AMD is their strategic CPU partner. And absolutely, we expect to be there in AI as well. But I'm not impatient with this.

You don't want to put a time stamp on it.

Look at it this way: When I first joined AMD in 2012, Microsoft was just an early partner for us in gaming. Over the past 10-plus years we've built a lot of trust, and now we're cocreating with them, so Microsoft just announced they're using AMD not only for their next-generation Xbox consoles but across their entire cloud.

Our work with Meta has been absolutely the same way. I remember the first conversation I had with Meta, and I said, “Just give me a shot. I don't have to tell you that I'm going to be the best in the world. I know that I'm going to prove that to you. I'm going to be your best partner. Not just your best technology partner but also your best partner in helping you get your technology infrastructure together.” And that's what we do.

At the AMD AI event in June you talked a fair amount about DeepSeek, the large language model that came out of China and reportedly cost a lot less money and computing power to train. How are AI models like that changing the way you're thinking about computing power?

Well, it's another example of just how much workloads have been changing in AI. People were previously all focused on large-scale training, and now with reasoning models and fine-tuning, the industry has transitioned to a place where inference-type computing is actually growing faster. It's why you have to have very flexible hardware.

So it's not changing the way we're thinking about it, because we always thought inference was going to be more important. I guess that means we were right in betting on that. We've optimized for memory capacity and other key things that are important for inference computing.

I'm going to bring up Nvidia again: Nvidia has been training some of its own models and offers a framework, NeMo, for developers to build their own generative AI models. How seriously have you thought about AMD training its own models?

We are training our own AI models. We have an AI models team. But we're not training our models for the sake of competing with big model builders. We train them to learn from them. The more we dog-food our own stuff, the more we learn, and then we can accelerate our building.

Analysts and even some of your customers have told me that AMD is incredibly customer-oriented. On the other hand, folks who are deep in the technical weeds say that ROCm, the set of software tools for programming AMD's hardware, still isn't as good as Nvidia's CUDA. What specific steps do you plan to make to lure in more developers?

Yeah, I mean, I agree that the software is the most critical layer, because it's what developers see. And when you think about ROCm and CUDA, it's not that one is better than the other. It's that CUDA has been around for a long time. People have gotten used to a certain ecosystem, and so we're actually teaching them a different ecosystem. That's the way to think of ROCm.

What I hear is that it's not just entrenchment, though. Developers say, “The compilers don't work as well” or “The performance libraries aren't as good” or “We want more portability.”

Sure. But the reason for that is because, hey, things are done a certain way in Nvidia's CUDA, and they would like to have it done a very similar way in ROCm. I have not yet met an AI customer that we haven't been able to get working, performant, and all of that stuff. We don't necessarily have all the libraries yet. There are lots of, let's call it special kernels, that have been written. So to your question of, What are we doing? I mean, we're running faster. That's the best answer: We are running faster.

I learned very early that you don't have to agree with criticism, but you have to understand it's a perspective. And then you decide what you're going to do on top of it. There's still a lot to do. And we're hiring like crazy. We're acquiring, and we're listening to developers. And I think what we've seen is you can actually make progress pretty quickly.

What do you make of the Meta Superintelligence Lab and Mark Zuckerberg reportedly offering AI talent people up to nine figures to go work for Meta? What does that kind of compensation do to hiring in the Valley?

I can't say I have direct experience with it, frankly. I think competition for talent is fierce. I am a believer, though, that money is important, but frankly, it's not necessarily the most important thing when you're attracting talent. I think it's important to be in the zip code [of those numbers], but then it's super-important to have people who really believe in the mission of what you're trying to do.

I think people have done relatively well here, because the stock's done OK. But from a recruitment standpoint, it's always like, “Do you want to be part of our mission?” Because the ride is really what we're trying to attract people to. It's the ride of, “Look, if you want to come do important technology, make an impact, you're not just a cog in the wheel, but you're actually someone who's going to drive the future of our road map, then you want to be at AMD.”

Do you envision ever offering anyone a nine-figure compensation package to come build out your software ecosystem?

I don't think so.

Because you'd have to answer to shareholders or make a case to your board?

Because it's not really about one person in our world. I mean, it's really about great people, don't get me wrong—we have some incredible people. We acquired Nod.ai, and Anush Elangovan, who was the CEO of that, has now become the head of our software ecosystem work. He's just absolutely phenomenal with his passion. He'll go after every single person who has an issue with ROCm. And I'm like, “Anush, how do you do that?” So that's what I mean. We're looking for people who have that type of passion for the work that we do, and there are lots of those people around.

What is “superintelligence” to you?

I think the idea that AI can make all of us superintelligent is a wonderful vision, and we're still in the very early innings of how to do that.

One of the areas that I'm most personally passionate about is health care, because I have had experience with the health care system, and I think it should be much, much better than it is today. We should be able to cure these diseases. We shouldn't have to do trial and error like we sometimes do. This is a perfect use case for AI. Being able to stitch all those pieces together to go from drug discovery to therapeutics to inpatient care, all of that is ripe for—let's call it transformation. I don't know if you call that “superintelligence.”

There's this idea floating around that AI is going to be so smart that it's going to eventually be able to delete humanity. How do you think about those kinds of predictions? Do you believe in AGI?

I do believe in AGI, but I don't believe in the idea that AI will be smarter than people. I also am not a big doomsday person or believer, either. Look, I mean, technology is great, but technology is as great as the people who build it and create it and channel it in the right direction. So I find those conversations a little bit esoteric. And our focus is, “The tech is good, but it's not great yet. How do we make it great?”

How do you measure “great”?

I think this idea of having AI solve real hard problems is when it gets great. And we talk about agents as one of the next big things. I think agents right now are doing, let's call it, relatively more of the mundane tasks of the world.

Lisa Su outside of AMD's headquarters.

Putting things in your shopping cart.

Right. I think there's two directions AI goes. One is pure productivity, you know, how do I remove some of, let's call it the menial work that people do, so that they can work on more interesting things? That's one aspect of it, and we're using that.

But the other aspect of it is when AI can solve really, really hard problems. It can take what would've taken us 10 years to figure out and do that in six months. I think about a world where it normally takes us three years to design a chip, and what does that look like if I could do that in six months?

Does humanity just not keep up at some point, though?

I don't know. I would bet on humanity being OK.

Technology can be a little bit overwhelming now.

Well, but Lauren, I think that's the point. When technology is good enough, you don't have to think about it. Today, you still have to think about when you go and ask—what's your favorite? Do you use ChatGPT or Grok?

I use ChatGPT, yeah. Not every day, but—

Often?

Often enough. I mean, I'm obligated to test these things.

Yeah, but you still have to make sure, “Hey, did it give me the right answer?”

Oh, absolutely. I mean, as a journalist in particular. I don't use it for my writing in any capacity. We draw a very hard line between using it for learning how to cook a steak versus using it for our journalism.

But you use it for research.

Sometimes, but the hallucinations are concerning.

But that's the point of it's not good enough yet. At some point, it's going to be good enough. You'd want to be able to take your AI at face value.

You mentioned health care. When we're older and infirm, will the generation of folks who are treating us be ChatGPT doctors?

I would like there to be a generation of folks treating us who have the vast amount of data that ChatGPT will have, so that they're better informed to make diagnoses.

When you think about AI philosophically, is it like the internet all over again? Is it more comparable to Linux, like it's going to be some operating system that runs on everything that we own? Is it electricity? Is it fire? I think Sundar Pichai has compared AI to fire, in terms of how transformative it is.

The internet is not a bad comparison, but I think AI is much more than the internet. Because, if you think about it, the internet was a lot about moving traffic. AI is more about something foundational in terms of productivity. Sometimes people compare it to the Industrial Revolution, and that's not a bad comparison, actually.

With other revolutions we weren't overwhelmed so much with thinking about what was true and real and what was not.

You can choose two ways to think about it. One is you try to hold back on AI because it could be dangerous, or you try to go as fast as you can but put the right lens on the information. I'm a big believer in the second camp. And as a result I don't believe in these cases where you're not going to need lots and lots of people. Because in the end, people are the judge of what truth is. We're still hiring more and more engineers, because they're the final arbiters of our engineering.

I am hopeful that humanity will figure it out.

And it will be so much better. It will be like the internet is to us today, which is you just take it for granted. We shouldn't evaluate the technology based on this point in time. We should evaluate it on the slope of what we're going to be capable of doing. We're going to get these things right. But we may have a few bumps in the road.

You seem a little concerned about AI. Are you just playing devil's advocate?

I tend to think the people who stand to benefit the most from these technologies are the ones who have the luxury of being a little bit more optimistic about it and who are hyping it up. There's that famous line: The future is not distributed evenly. Even with the advancements in medicine, we're going to see biases emerge that lead to people getting denied health care or insurance coverage. We've already seen this.

Health care, for me, is quite personal, because my mom was quite ill. For a while. And so I got to watch her journey going through that. And I realized, like, it doesn't matter who you are. You can't guarantee the best health care, because it's really an art right now. It's not a science. And I believe it should be a science.

Why do you think it's an art?

The body is a very complex system. So you have specialists, like a heart specialist or a kidney specialist. But there are not that many generalists that can pull it all together. And that, to me, is a travesty. I'm like, come on—this is solvable.

That's what we do in tech, right? We take complex systems and put them together, and we make them work. But we're often only looking at one aspect of health, and it's my firm belief that if we can use technology to help pull all of that expertise together, we'll be able to treat people better. I watched it firsthand. So, anyways, in my next life when I have time to do something other than this—

You'll be a doctor?

I won't be a doctor, but I hope to be someone who can help bridge the divide and use technology for what it's actually capable of.

You could do that in this lifetime, too.

I have a few things to do right now.

Was your mother able to recover?

No, unfortunately.

I'm sorry.

But you know what I mean? I just realized that—wow.

You realized, it could happen to any of us.

Yes, but it's about the quality of care, even with the best doctors.

About a year ago my own mother had some really serious health issues, and she ended up in the ICU on a ventilator. Doctors kept coming in and looking at scans and couldn't figure out what was going on. And I was sitting in the hospital thinking, I'm so deep in the world of reporting on AI, where people are touting incredible medical advancements, but we can't tell what's happening from these scans?

So you know. You know exactly what I mean. It's infuriating for me to think my mom was in the ICU for 60 days, and people said, “Nobody walks out of that.” They were like, “She's not going to be able to do it.” And I was like, “Yes, she is. I know she is.” I wasn't the one qualified to make those calls, right? And she did. She survived another two years after that.

You talk often about resilience. How do you personally—not the company, but you—stay resilient? Is it Starbucks? I noticed you had one at your AI event.

Yes, this is a passion tea lemonade, and it does a lot for me. I'm not a big caffeine drinker, so this and a bit of exercise does it for me. I go in waves [with Starbucks]. Sometimes I have a lot, and sometimes I cut myself off.

Same. What's your preferred form of exercise?

I like to box. I have a trainer that comes to the house, and he lets me hit him. Well, not him, but mitts.

How long have you been doing that?

I don't know. Seven, eight years, something like that.

So two to three years after you became CEO, you were like, “I need to work some stuff out here.”

Yes.

How much do you sleep per night?

Five, six hours. Six is a really good number. On weekends, I might be seven.

What impresses you most as a leader? When you have your first meeting with someone, what impresses you?

Passion for what they're doing. Because I think that stays with you through good times and bad times. Things are always going to go wrong, but if you're truly passionate about what you do, then I think you shine.

What irritates you?

What irritates me?

Yes.

Well, I can't say people who ask me about Jensen being my cousin?

You can totally say that.

To tell you the truth, it doesn't really irritate me, but it's more like, “Really? Is that the most important thing we have to talk about?”

What is it you feel like people don't really know about you, that you want them to understand about you?

I feel like people know me. No? Well … I get up every day because I believe our products can change the world, and they can make the world a better place. So there's always noise—this, that, export controls, whatever. Those are noise.

So is it that you're a supreme optimist?

I don't think of myself that way, but I'm probably a supreme technology optimist. I'm actually quite pragmatic. So I'm a pragmatic supreme technology optimist. How does that sound?

It sounds like ChatGPT generated it.

That was not a programmed response.

How would I describe myself? I do believe tech has the opportunity to change so much of how we experience life in a very, very positive way. So in that case, I am a supreme technology optimist. But I'm pragmatic in how you get there. And how you get there is every day, step by step. We learn, we listen, we adjust. We apply what we learn. That's just what we do.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Character.AI Gave Up on AGI. Now It's Selling Stories","https://www.wired.com/story/character-ai-ceo-chatbots-entertainment/","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 15:30:00 GMT","

After school, Karandeep Anand often finds his 6-year-old daughter deep in conversation with an AI chatbot as she eats snacks at their kitchen counter. She's too young to type—let alone have her own account on Character.AI—but that hasn't stopped her from nabbing his phone to have voice conversations with a Sherlock Holmes bot, which she uses to build her own mystery stories.

Character.AI is an AI companion startup (though Anand likes to say it's an AI role-play startup, which we'll get into later). He took over as the CEO in June in the midst of a potentially devastating lawsuit for its parent company and looming questions about child safety. When I ask if he's concerned about his daughter connecting with an AI chatbot rather than a real human, he's quick to say no.

“It is very rarely, in any of these scenarios, a true replacement for any human,” Anand told me during a video call late last week. ”It's very clearly noted in the app that, hey, this is a role-play and an entertainment, so you will never start going deep into that conversation, assuming that it is your actual companion.”

It's a delicate moment for Character.AI.

Last August, Google swooped in with a roughly $2.7 billion deal to license Character.AI's technology. As part of the agreement, Character.AI's two cofounders left for Google's AI division.

Anand, who previously worked as the VP of business products at Meta, was tasked with picking up the pieces—which he did in part by leaving behind the founding mission of delivering personalized superintelligence to focus on AI entertainment.

“What we gave up was this aspiration that the founders had of building AGI models—we are no longer doing that. That is the hundreds of billions of dollars investment fight, which Big Tech is fighting,” Anand says. “What we got in return was clarity and focus, being able to singularly pursue the AI entertainment vision.”

As part of this change in strategy, Character.AI is no longer trying to build its own frontier models. “The last six months, we've done a lot of work to get off of our proprietary models on text and start using open source models,” Anand says. The company has tested a few: Meta's Llama, Alibaba's Qwen, and DeepSeek. “The open source models are beating any proprietary model hands down,” Anand claims.

Running an AI startup without billions of dollars in revenue can be a brutal equation, and Character.AI is still figuring out how to make the math work. The company told me it's generating revenue at a run rate of more than $30 million and is on track to reach $50 million in revenue by the end of the year. When I asked Anand how many users pay for the $10 monthly subscription, he didn't give a number but noted “monetization wasn't a focus till four or five months ago.”

“Since I've been on board, it's very clear we do need to monetize. And we've had, I think, almost 250 percent subscriber growth in the last six months. So the paid user base is growing quite, quite well,” Anand says. Character.AI recently introduced advertisements, including reward ads (where users can choose to watch an ad to get access to on-platform incentives), to help monetize in countries where subscriptions aren't feasible, he tells me.

“AI is expensive. Let's be honest about that,” Anand says.

In October 2024, the mother of a teen who died by suicide filed a wrongful death suit against Character Technologies, its founders, Google, and Alphabet, alleging the company targeted her son with “anthropomorphic, hypersexualized, and frighteningly realistic experiences, while programming [the chatbot] to misrepresent itself as a real person, a licensed psychotherapist, and an adult lover.” At the time, a Character.AI spokesperson told CNBC that the company was “heartbroken by the tragic loss” and took “the safety of our users very seriously.”

The tragic incident put Character.AI under intense scrutiny. Earlier this year, US senators Alex Padilla and Peter Welch wrote a letter to several AI companionship platforms, including Character.AI, highlighting concerns about “the mental health and safety risks posed to young users” of the platforms.

“The team has been taking this very responsibly for almost a year now,” Anand tells me. “AI is stochastic, it's kind of hard to always understand what's coming. So it's not a one time investment.”

That's critically important because Character.AI is growing. The startup has 20 million monthly active users who spend, on average, 75 minutes a day chatting with a bot (a “character” in Character.AI parlance). The company's user base is 55 percent female. More than 50 percent of its users are Gen Z or Gen Alpha. With that growth comes real risk—what is Anand doing to keep his users safe?

“[In] the last six months, we've invested a disproportionate amount of resources in being able to serve under 18 differently than over 18, which was not the case last year,” Anand says. “I can't say, ‘Oh, I can slap an 18+ label on my app and say use it for NSFW.' You end up creating a very different app and a different small-scale platform.”

More than 10 of the company's 70 employees work full-time on trust and safety, Anand tells me. They're responsible for building safeguards like age verification, separate models for users under 18, and new features such as parental insights, which allow parents to see how their teens are using the app.

The under-18 model launched last December. It includes “a narrower set of searchable Characters on the platform,” according to company spokesperson Kathryn Kelly. “Filters have been applied to this set to remove Characters related to sensitive or mature topics.”

But Anand says AI safety will take more than just technical tweaks. “Making this platform safe is a partnership between regulators, us, and parents,” Anand says. That's what makes watching his daughter chat with a Character so important. “This has to stay safe for her.”

The AI companionship market is booming. Consumers worldwide spent $68 million on AI companionship in the first half of this year, a 200 percent increase from last year, according to an estimate cited by CNBC. AI startups are gunning for a slice of the market: xAI released a creepy, pornified companion in July, and even Microsoft bills its Copilot chatbot as an AI companion.

So how does Character.AI stand out in a crowded market? It takes itself out of it entirely.

“AI companionship is the wrong way to look at what people do with Character. What people are doing with Character is actually role-play. And it sounds interchangeable, but it isn't,” Anand tells me, adding that less than 20 percent of the app gets used for companionship (that's according to an internal research report of data self-reported by users). It doesn't appear to be totally out of the simulated relationship game, though—it took me all of a few minutes to find an AI boyfriend to engage in graphic sexual role-play with.

“People want to role-play situations. People want to role-play fiction … They want to live in alternate realities. They want to unplug from their day-to-day stuff,” Anand says.

I, personally, unplug from my day through a different kind of virtual world. I am totally addicted to the video game Stardew Valley. I run Huckleberry Farm like the damn Marines. To Anand, the video game is more of a competitor than Grok. “It became very clear that we're an entertainment company,” Anand says.

When it comes to role-playing, the Seattle-based CEO says he's mostly into using Characters for vampire fan fiction. The problem, he says, is that when the vampire bot talks about blood, it gets censored. “The context needs to be understood, so we dial back on the filters by being a lot more precise with the context,” Anand tells me.

This level of content moderation is one of the many changes Anand has been working on since taking over the company in June. The company also redesigned the app with a more modern, Gen Z–friendly look and added new tools for the platform's creators, who generate more than 9 million Characters per month. These updates, he says, mark a shift from Character.AI being seen as just a chatbot company to something more ambitious: an entertainment engine where users can consume and create stories, remix content, and experiment with new formats like audiobooks.

“Every story can actually have a billion endings,” Anand says. A user could even stage a roast battle between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, he adds. “You can prompt that and output something pretty fun.”

I'm not sure the litany of lawyers employed by those tech CEOs would be as entertained. That's not to mention the people who may not be able to afford an army of staff to defend their personhood. I immediately thought of a WIRED story about the family of an 18-year-old who was killed in 2006 only to find the image likeness of their daughter re-created on Character.AI. In that same story, an editor at a gaming publication found she had been re-created on the platform following a harassment campaign involving her coverage.

When I bring this up to Anand, he explains that when users create Characters modeled after public figures like Musk or Bezos, the system is designed to clearly signal that these are parodies, not attempts at deepfakes or impersonation. (One Elon Musk chatbot page doesn't show such warnings. Neither do the Dr. Phil or Joe Rogan chatbot pages.) Though, there's a disclaimer below each chat: “This is an A.I. and not a real person. Treat everything it says as fiction.”

Anand says Character.AI has also imposed strict limitations on the company's video generation tool, AvatarFX, to prevent misuse. Users shouldn't be able to generate realistic deepfakes even if they try, and specific voices or topics are outright restricted.

“We're very, very clear that we're staying in the entertainment territory. We're not into the general purpose video generation territory at all. We're not a Google Veo 3. We're not a Runway,” Anand says. “It's a very, very important line.”

Anand contrasts this with platforms like Meta, where he claims content is often uploaded first and moderated after the fact. At Character.AI, he says, content guardrails are baked into the creation pipeline itself. “Our reactive takedowns are a very, very small percentage,” Anand tells me.

I worry that as these tools grow more convincing, loneliness will deepen, not disappear. Anand understands. But he also has something to sell.

“I'm very passionate about this topic myself, and it's on us to go shape the dialog around this in the best, healthy way possible, because Gen Z is AI-native,” Anand says. “The question is, how do we build this in a way where it's safe and trustworthy and engaging in the right ways with the right incentives? That's on us.”

Last week, I reported that Elon Musk held an all-hands meeting for X and xAI employees. I've since obtained another screenshot from that meeting showing xAI's revenue over the past seven months.

In January, Grok on X brought in just under $150 million, with other services like enterprise API usage adding another $28 million. According to the chart, revenue has grown tenfold since the start of 2025, reaching just south of $500 million in July—driven by Grok on X and the $30 a month SuperGrok subscription. A smaller fraction of revenue is generated by the newly released SuperGrok Heavy subscription, which costs $300 a month. xAI did not respond to WIRED's request for comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Rise of the US Military's Clandestine Foreign War Apparatus","https://www.wired.com/story/the-fort-bragg-cartel-seth-harp-excerpt/","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The 2020s are shaping up to be one of the most violent decades in modern history, with American-sponsored proxy conflicts and shadow wars smoldering all over the world, from Ukraine to Yemen to Gaza. The United States enables and prolongs these wars not by sending troops to fight in them, but by trafficking arms to the belligerents, providing intelligence to its favored proxies, and using covert operations, especially assassinations, to shape geopolitical conditions. At the forefront of these clandestine US military machinations is the Fort Bragg-based Joint Special Operations Command, or JSOC, which despite its relative invisibility to the public is far and away the most powerful organization in the military, and one of the most influential institutions in the US government. But it was not always this way.

As I discuss in my new book, The Fort Bragg Cartel, the rise of JSOC does not date back to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, or the wars that the United States waged in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the Twin Towers. Rather, the origins of JSOC's takeover from within are traceable to the darkest days of the Iraq War, about five years after 9/11, when things were going considerably worse for American war planners and foreign policy officials, and—in a backlash that would lead to the election of President Barack Obama—the public was turning sharply against US involvement in foreign wars.

This excerpt tells part of that story.

On just one day in June 2006, the Associated Press reported that shootings and bombings killed 12 people in Baghdad, a suicide bomber killed four and wounded 27 at the funeral of a Shiite soldier, seven bullet-riddled bodies were pulled from the Tigris River, two who had been tortured to death were fished out of the Euphrates, and police found the body of a teenage girl who had been raped and murdered in Kirkuk. Amid this horrible paroxysm of revenge killings, auguring Iraq's descent into outright civil war split along sectarian lines, President George W. Bush and his national security council pulled together a host of new advisors in an attempt to revise their failing strategy. It was at this juncture that a number of ambitious officials in the special operations community stepped up to offer a new path forward. The plan of action that they developed, which Bush's successor would adopt and expand in Afghanistan, forever transformed the American way of making war, and goes a long way toward explaining how Fort Bragg, North Carolina, even more than the CIA's headquarters at Langley, Virginia, came to be the United States' national nerve center of invisible imperial power.

Stanley McChrystal, then a two-star major general, was the most important figure in this revolution in military affairs. McChrystal, a West Point graduate and the son of a distinguished general, had risen through the ranks in the 75th Ranger Regiment and was groomed for some of the Army's most sensitive missions. Smart, shrewd, charismatic, and press-savvy, McChrystal first came to prominence as a Pentagon spokesman, and in 2003, was tapped to lead black ops JSOC, which until then had been relegated to important but limited roles. Consistent with the emphasis laid on psychological operations in the Special Forces, the most important warfighting innovation that McChrystal developed while serving in this position was not primarily tactical or strategic but ideological and mediatic.

Although there were relatively few foreign fighters in Iraq and most came from neighboring Syria, McChrystal was the primary proponent of the view, quick to spread among Washington policymakers, that the enemy was not a nationalist rebellion against outside occupation, but one node of a global conspiracy of America-hating terrorists. To describe this nebulous and inherently malignant foe, McChrystal and his staff invented the term “al-Qaeda in Iraq” or AQI. At the top of this dubious organization, which they themselves had done more than anyone else to conjure into being, JSOC analysts placed the dopey Jordanian criminal Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a mysterious Bedouin bogeyman, much hyped by deceitful Pentagon spooks in the runup to the war, who may not have even been in Iraq at the time. To explain away the paucity of tangible contacts between insurgents in Iraq and Osama bin Laden's organization, the remnants of which were now scattered around Pakistan and Yemen, McChrystal and his aides redefined al-Qaeda as a concentric grouping of decentralized “franchises” operating on a “blind cell model.”

In his memoir, McChrystal admits with remarkable if belated frankness that JSOC produced intelligence assessments “that inflated al-Qaeda's role,” and “problematically used ‘AQI' as a catchall designation for any Sunni group that attacked Americans.” This narrative, he acknowledges, was a way to “sidestep the reality” that most Iraqi insurgents were primarily motivated by “earthly grievances,” not Islamist ideology. There's no indication, however, that he shared these important caveats with President Bush, who seized upon the imaginary influx of foreign jihadists into Iraq as an after-the-fact vindication of his discredited case for war. By grossly exaggerating Zarqawi's importance, McChrystal and his deputy, Vice Admiral William McRaven, convinced the Bush administration that it was possible for the United States to kill its way to victory in Iraq through a massively stepped-up campaign of targeted assassinations. This was an essential precondition for the rise of JSOC.

Another of the advisors whom Bush called upon to reformulate the war effort in late 2006 was Michael Vickers, the top Pentagon official in charge of the larger umbrella organization over JSOC, the Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, known by the comically unwieldy acronym “ASD SO/LIC & IC,” for Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations/Low-Intensity Conflict and Interdependent Capabilities. In his memoir, Vickers recalls how the Bush administration scrapped its existing playbook and instituted a new policy that put JSOC firmly in charge of the fight in Iraq.

The plan involved a two-pronged approach, the public-facing aspect of which was a temporary buildup or “surge” of conventional forces. But the real escalation took place behind the scenes, as JSOC was quietly tasked with implementing a radically expanded campaign of mass assassinations very similar to the Vietnam-era Phoenix Program, which in spite of the repugnance it had elicited in the public, was considered a success by the Washington-dwelling national-security set. Once limited to former regime officials and leaders of the insurgency, JSOC's hit list, euphemistically known as the “disposition matrix” or “joint prioritized effects list,” grew exponentially to include anyone, however youthful or peripheral, suspected of taking up arms against American occupiers. Vickers calls this covert war the “hidden surge.”

From now on, Iraq would be a war of targeted killings carried out clandestinely, almost always at night. Swollen with new infusions of money, personnel, equipment, and aircraft, JSOC became “JSOC on steroids,” a “counterterrorism killing machine” capable of slaying recalcitrant Iraqis on a scale that both Vickers and McChrystal describe as “industrial.” From about 10 a month at the start of the war, the number of night raids that JSOC carried out increased to 10 per day at the height of the surge.

McChrystal called this relentless tempo the “continuous targeting cycle.” Fluent in McKinsey-style jargon like “decision cycle,” “dynamic process,” and “nodal analysis,” he was adept at spitting out pithy truisms such as “it takes a network to defeat a network,” and a prolific coiner of acronyms like F3EAD, which stood for Find, Fix, Finish, Exploit, Analyze, and Disseminate.

Despite the ungainly initialism, the F3EAD cycle was not a complicated concept. It typically meant tracking down a target, killing him and every adult man and teenage boy in the vicinity, seizing every piece of paper and electronic device found on their persons, and using these materials to come up with more names to add to the hit list, and then killing them too, sometimes just a few hours later.

The hidden surge, in which the Army component of JSOC, known as Delta Force, played the leading role, was greatly enabled by the widespread adoption of cell phones in Iraq, a technological development that coincided with the first few years of American occupation. JSOC's screen-filled headquarters at Camp Anaconda received an influx of personnel from the National Security Agency, who found it trivial to intercept unencrypted calls on Iraq's burgeoning mobile networks, and could easily transform cell phones into listening devices.

Television and film depictions of the Global War on Terrorism often portray American operators and spies as able to speak the local languages, suavely lobbing savvy quotations from the Koran at their truculent Islamist antagonists. But in a startling admission with sobering implications, McChrystal states in his memoir that JSOC in Iraq was “hindered by an almost complete lack of Arabic skills within our force,” suggesting that nearly all of those whom Delta Force killed were targeted not on the basis of the content of telephonic intercepts, but on pseudoscientific “nodal analysis,” tips from paid informants, and arbitrary guesswork.

“We were not death squads,” McChrystal writes. But armed with NSA intercepts, backed by newly developed Reaper drones, and joined by fierce Kurdish mercenaries called Mohawks, that's exactly what JSOC became during the covert surge in Iraq, which lasted into 2008. The body count from Delta Force's killing spree, and the proportion of Iraq's hundreds of thousands of war dead who were gunned down in JSOC night raids, will never be known because it wasn't recorded in the first place. That these events are lost to the historical and photographic record was by design. What Vickers dubs the “hidden surge” was a side of the Iraq war never intended to be seen by the public, who were fed images of conventional, uniformed troops on patrol, but never any footage of the plainclothes men who did nearly all of the nighttime wet work.

“From 2006 on, 90 percent or higher of insurgent deaths were from targeted, offensive SOF operations,” said a former Delta Force sergeant major who served in Iraq during the surge, using an acronym that refers to special operations forces in general. “Going out night after night, on purpose, and getting in firefights with bad guys—that job fell to us.”

Instead of mounting patrols and reacting to fire like conventional infantry, Delta Force operators identified their targets from a distance, in advance, and took them by surprise, often making use of perfidious techniques such as disguising themselves as Iraqis, using wigs, brownface, and prosthetics. They posed as Red Cross personnel, United Nations inspectors, western businessmen, or European diplomats. With the help of female support soldiers, they passed themselves off as husband-and-wife pairs, masquerading, for instance, as married schoolteachers who'd come to teach English to Iraqi kids. They even copied the enemy's tactics and blew up targets with roadside bombs.

Among themselves, the bearded, long-haired operators called each other by their first names, eschewed divisions of rank, and dressed in a mishmash of civilian attire. When they did wear uniforms, the unit patches they sported were purely fictitious: hometown police badges, the seals of various states, Spartan helmets, Crusader shields, the Confederate battle flag, or jokey tabs that said things like “HATCHET FORCE” or “FUCK AL QAEDA.”

No camera crews ever went on night raids with Delta Force. Their operations were not the subject of news documentaries, nor do we possess any oral histories, because silence is the unit's chief point of pride. But over time, these strictures inevitably loosen, if only a little. In recent years, many former special operators have gone on podcasts to discuss their military careers in a certain Army “special mission unit” or “compartmented element.” And once-rare photos of JSOC operations have found their way onto social media, including images of Delta Force in Iraq under McCrystal's leadership.

“Several of my rotations to Iraq [were] composed of just my team and a small HQ element,” a former Delta Force troop sergeant major named Jesse Boettcher wrote in an Instagram post dated February 28, 2022. “While I had the full force of the US government just a radio call away, there were very few of us on the ground getting dirty. Our small element was able to execute and refine the entire F3EAD cycle almost daily, with very little outside assistance.”

In the photo accompanying the post, Boettcher, then in his mid-thirties, sits at a table dressed in soiled civilian clothes. In back of him is a whiteboard. Much of the writing on it has been blacked out, but you can still read random words, including “meeting,” “explosives,” “liaison,” “interrogation,” and “safehouse.” Taped on the wall behind the whiteboard is a grid of 55 mugshots of brown-skinned men. Almost all of them have been crossed out with an X.

Another picture, posted January 19, 2022, shows the rest of Boettcher's team, a group of seven unkempt white men. “It might look like a ragtag bunch of ruffians, but this crew were straight-up Pipe-Hitters,” Boettcher wrote, using an obscure term considered a high compliment in the special operations community that derives from the concept of a soldier who is so fearless, daring, and addicted to war that he can be likened to a smoker of crack cocaine. “The guys in front,” Boettcher wrote, referring to three fresh-faced, clean-shaven young men kneeling in the foreground, “have killed more people than cancer.”

Here's a simple question: Is the current top iPhone better for the environment than the top iPhone was five years ago?

Let's take the iPhone Pro series. If we're looking at recycled and renewable materials, it's an easy yes. Compare the iPhone 11 Pro, released in September 2019, with the iPhone 16 Pro, released in September 2024, and there has been good progress—from a few smaller components and packaging to now at more than 25 percent of the whole phone. There's work to do, of course, but that's what you'd expect at Apple's halfway point to its 2030 goal of carbon neutrality.

But what the iPhone is made out of is only one part of the picture. Take a look at the carbon emissions for each iPhone's life cycle, including everything from materials to the electricity for manufacturing, transportation and charging, and things get more complicated. The AI race is only compounding the problem.

In 2020, the year Apple set out its net-zero climate goals, per-phone emissions were 82 kilograms CO2E (carbon dioxide equivalent) for the iPhone 12 Pro. After a sharp decrease to 69 kilograms in the iPhone 13 Pro, progress that Apple attributes to its Supplier Clean Energy Program, things start to slow—and then, with the iPhone 15 Pro, stall almost completely.

It's at this point that Apple changed its reporting in a way that makes it harder to understand year-on-year improvements—moving to a comparison versus a 2015 baseline of 92 kilograms instead. So when the iPhone 16 Pro arrived in 2024 with the same level of emissions as the 15 Pro, it was still positioned as having greenhouse gas emissions savings of 30 percent rather showing those savings at a relative standstill, year on year.

So while, yes, the current top iPhone is better for the environment than five years ago (and the figures for some of the base models show even greater improvements), most of that progress was made between 2020 and 2022. As Apple has pushed forward with AI and introduced emissions-heavy technological innovations to support it, the company has been left mostly treading water. All while, in contrast, 2023's Fairphone 5 managed to get its life cycle emissions down to just 42 kilograms. (Fairphone will release the figures for its newer Fairphone 6 in October.)

The wider context here, though, is that the house is on fire. Google's total greenhouse gas emissions increased an astonishing 48 percent between 2019 and 2023—in part due to its energy-guzzling AI data centers—and last year it dropped its carbon neutrality pledge (though it still claims it will be at net-zero emissions by 2030). Elsewhere, Microsoft's total emissions increased by 23 percent from 2020 to 2024, which it attributed to growth in AI and cloud expansion, Amazon's shipping and delivery emissions keep going up, and Samsung is running behind on its more limited net-zero aims.

As the kids say, the bar is in hell. At least Apple hasn't backtracked; Apple's still playing. But as Tim Cook doubles down on Apple's commitment to AI, can Cupertino keep up with its climate goals while pushing forward in its AI ambitions?

In a comment to WIRED, Apple didn't exactly acknowledge the challenges it's facing. “As data clearly show, Apple is on track to meet our ambitious goal to be carbon neutral across our entire footprint by 2030,” it said.

“We've reduced our global emissions by more than 60 percent since 2015 and worked with our suppliers to bring nearly 18 gigawatts of clean energy online across our supply chain. We're laser-focused on continuing this progress with more collaboration and innovation in the years ahead.”

However, at the September 2024 iPhone launch, Apple was pretty quiet about its sustainability progress. There were only a few mentions of the recycled materials used across its hardware and its packaging—a stark contrast to the five-minute chat with Octavia Spencer as Mother Nature that opened 2023's event.

In 2023, Apple opened its iPhone launch with a five-minute video on sustainability, featuring Octavia Spencer as Mother Nature.

Then, in April 2025, Reuters reported that Apple had chartered a cargo jet with a capacity of 100 tons out of Chennai airport in Tamil Nadu, India. It was the sixth chartered flight on the route since March, designed to beat Trump's tariffs and get an estimated 1.5 million iPhones into the United States, fast.

This might seem like a questionable move for a company striving for carbon neutrality, but Lena Chang, climate and energy program director at Greenpeace East Asia, says things like this are actually the least concerning issue facing Apple's 2030 pledge: “It's ironic to point out [the cargo jets], but transportation emissions are a small part of the supply chain.”

Instead, Greenpeace points to other forces it believes are slowing Apple's progress. According to Apple's 2025 Environmental Progress Report, reductions in its total “Scope 3” manufacturing emissions—the indirect greenhouse gas emissions outside of the company's control but created due to its operations—slowed to a 13 percent decrease between September 2023 and September 2024 versus an equivalent 30 percent decrease from 2022 to 2023.

To explain this, Chang and her team are focused on what they see as the gap between Apple's commitments and those of its suppliers in Asia, producing an easily digestible ranking of the recent climate progress and commitments of the five major final assembly suppliers to Apple: Foxconn, Luxshare Precision, Wistron, Compal and Pegatron.

Of them all, only Wistron has commitments that align with Apple's (100 percent renewable energy by 2030), but the company hasn't released any data for 2024 as yet. Pegatron is only committed to 50 percent in the same time, with Foxconn and Compal not hoping to make 100 percent until 2040 and 2050 respectively.  (WIRED requested comment from all five of these suppliers and received no reply.)

Chang points to the ambition of Apple's two Clean Energy Funds in the region, worth around $400 million, but wants to see stronger accountability from the company regarding its suppliers in mainland China and Taiwan.

“We are talking with some suppliers of Apple, and they actually complain that ‘yeah, we see there's money there, but there's just not enough incentive for us to initiate a project,'” Chang explains. “We need suppliers to take more initiative, and we need stronger enforcement from Apple, whether it's monitoring on a year-to-year basis or strengthening its reporting mechanism to really push its suppliers to adopt more renewable energy.”

This problem now stretches to India too, alongside Vietnam, as Apple scrambles to shift the assembly of the iPhones bound for the US, due to instability around global tariffs. Foxconn accounts for a large share of the local iPhone assembly in the region, but Tata Electronics, a subsidiary of Tata Group, is growing in importance after several big investments. (WIRED requested comment and sustainability data from Tata Electronics; the company said it cannot accommodate the request.)

“Tata Electronics itself, as a subsidiary, has not said anything yet on climate—anything significant,” says Ashish Fernandes, CEO and founder of Climate Risk Horizons, a think tank covering India's energy transition. Tata Group has various climate commitments and was carbon neutral for its energy usage for a period, but Fernandes says it isn't clear how these impact the iPhone assembly operations—a lack of clarity he believes can't continue: “If you want to manufacture for Apple, there's going to be a lot of scrutiny.”

It isn't alone. From the 14 suppliers that have manufacturing units for Apple in India, Climate Risk Horizons researcher Simran Kalra says, only three have specified their renewable energy share in India—and it isn't particularly good news.

FIH Mobile's 2024 ESG report showed a renewable energy ratio for its two plants in Tamil Nadu was 35.5 percent (FIH said it is not currently “a direct Apple supplier,” but the company has previously worked with Apple), while Flex's was around 27 percent in both 2023 and 2024. As for Pegatron? Its 2022 and 2023 reports showed it used no renewable energy in India at all.

“India is not exactly a country where it's difficult to get renewables going,” says Fernandes. “We've got a pretty big domestic renewables industry already. So it should be fairly simple for Apple to insist to its suppliers that they meet the bulk of it from renewables and 100 percent by ‘X' date.”

However, it is the conflict between AI and climate goals that can be viewed as the most “vicious cycle,” as UK-based analyst Jan Stryjak, who leads Counterpoint Research's work on sustainability, puts it.

“AI is hugely costly when it comes to energy usage and water. So a lot of companies are using AI to make their operations more efficient in order to use more AI, or to support more AI, which in turn requires them to be more energy and operationally efficient. Apple is no different.”

Apple's next-gen Siri currently uses ChatGPT for some requests.

At first blush, Apple Intelligence at least looks to be somewhat different. It aims to offer an on-device, privacy focused, perhaps more climate-friendly alternative to the cloud-based AI agents. For user requests that need larger models, Apple points to its creation of Private Cloud Compute, hosted on Apple silicon servers at the company's data centers, which are powered by 100 percent renewable energy.

But can Apple scale this 100 renewable infrastructure while competing in a field where it is lagging behind? According to Data Centre Map, Apple operates 16 of these data centers, with six more sites planned or under construction. For comparison, OpenAI partner and investor Microsoft has 120-plus data centers, Amazon runs 200-plus, and Google runs 66 with at least 30 more planned—the very expansions behind some of the biggest climate progress reversals.

Even as a smaller, more energy-efficient AI agent, Apple Intelligence still has power trade-offs—particularly when it leans on ChatGPT to answer some search questions in Siri, a partnership which Apple said late last year is not part of the Private Cloud Compute plan.

“A year ago, when they were talking about Apple Intelligence, it struck me how they were doing an ‘all of the above,' right? They had their own thing but they could fall back onto ChatGPT,” says Ben Lee, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania in the department of electrical and systems engineering, who has previously consulted for Meta and Google on sustainability.

“That suggests that they're not quite sure that the smaller models give them what they want on device,” he says. “I think they're trying to develop the capability first and foremost and then trying to figure out efficiency later.”

The path to developing more advanced AI capabilities hasn't exactly been smooth, with key features painfully delayed and next-gen Siri pushed further and further back—with the upgrade now not expected until spring 2026. Recent Bloomberg reporting suggests that Apple leadership is weighing a move to OpenAI or Anthropic technology to help finally deliver its AI promises for a new version of Siri, with tests of these outside models on Apple's cloud infrastructure. The question is: Will Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives, be at that table when these decisions are made?

Even if she is, there is no getting away from the electricity needed to manufacture the advanced semiconductor chips powering on-device Apple Intelligence (like the A18 and A18 Pro chips) and Apple's own AI servers (reportedly Apple's M4 chips as of this year). “Taiwan doesn't have such a rapid deployment of renewable energy, and South Korea, another place that fabricates a lot of chips, doesn't have a lot of it at all,” says Lee.

In March, TSMC—the Taiwan-based semiconductor chipmaker which powers flagship iPhones—put out a 2024 report, including a section on ESG: There was a 19 percent increase in greenhouse gas emissions per product unit versus its target of a 10 percent decrease. There was also a 14 percent increase in water use and, drumroll please, only around 14 percent of its used energy came from renewables.

The TSMC press team, when asked for comment, pointed to TSMC accelerating its renewable energy timeline by 10 years in 2023, a 20-year joint procurement agreement for 20,000 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy, and its partnership with Apple on the Restore Fund for carbon-removal projects.

But Greenpeace's Lena Chang wants to see TSMC investing more into Taiwan's wind, solar, and geothermal energy industries, following Google's lead there. “The majority of TSMC's renewable energy is purchased,” she says. “They can take the initiative to invest more. From a passive consumer to a proactive prosumer, that's what we are trying to call out TSMC to do more.”

Of course one of the trickiest threads to solve in all of this is the incompatibility of building AI-capable chips for iPhones which are used on average for just two and a half years before a customer upgrades to a new device.

“Unlike data centers, which buy hardware and then deploy them for very long lifetimes and get very high utilization, you don't get that in the consumer electronics side,” says Lee. “Apple would like us to refresh our hardware every two years or so. So that's the difficulty. You have the Scope 3 emissions numbers [for the supply chain], then very high refresh rates and relatively poor utilization.”

He believes that after years of flattening in performance and a commoditization of general-purpose CPUs, we otherwise would have seen a slowing down in overall hardware refresh rates: “I think AI is probably restarting the cadence of refresh.”

If we continue to get an iPhone launch annually, if Cupertino continues to pack in advanced Apple silicon into every premium device and upgrade cycles remain at 2.5 years, then attention to the afterlife of iPhones becomes more pressing. Globally, Apple makes up just over half the entire secondary smartphone market and while around one in three owners in the US resell their smartphone, that figure drops to around one in five in Europe.

That's not helped by the fact that the amount Apple currently offers to recover traded-in iPhones is much less than the competition, says Counterpoint's Jan Stryjak. Elsewhere, in some countries, there's simply too many different prices and gradings on offer to make sense for the average phone owner: “This is something the industry needs to rectify, to help with giving those older iPhones that second life.”

Apple appears not to be blind to the challenges it is facing. In April, Lisa Jackson said this in a press release on Apple's environmental progress: “As we get closer to 2030, the work gets even harder—and we're meeting the challenge with innovation, collaboration, and urgency.”

Apple is ]the third biggest company in the world by market cap. As its AI agent strategy becomes clearer, environment charities and sustainability experts see a number of ways that it could strengthen its work toward its 2030 climate goals to counteract new innovation.

Then again, the first and second biggest companies in the world? Nvidia and Microsoft, two of the companies at the forefront of the shift toward AI. “We will keep campaigning on the supply chain decarbonization, especially now there seems to be no stopping in AI technology,” says Greenpeace's Lena Chang. “It is really important that we keep the balance between AI and sustainable development.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Data Brokers Are Hiding Their Opt-Out Pages From Google Search","https://www.wired.com/story/data-brokers-hiding-opt-out-pages-google-search/","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

Data brokers are required by California law to provide ways for consumers to request their data be deleted. But good luck finding them.

More than 30 of the companies, which collect and sell consumers' personal information, hid their deletion instructions from Google, according to a review by The Markup and CalMatters of hundreds of broker websites. This creates one more obstacle for consumers who want to delete their data.

This story is copublished with The Markup and CalMatters.

Many of the pages containing the instructions, listed in an official state registry, use code to tell search engines to remove the page entirely from search results. Popular tools like Google and Bing respect the code by excluding pages when responding to users.

Data brokers nationwide must register in California under the state's Consumer Privacy Act, which allows Californians to request that their information be removed, that it not be sold, or that they get access to it.

After reviewing the websites of all 499 data brokers registered with the state, we found 35 had code to stop certain pages from showing up in searches.

While those companies might be fulfilling the letter of the law by providing a page consumers can use to delete their data, it means little if those consumers can't find the page, according to Matthew Schwartz, a policy analyst at Consumer Reports who studies the California law governing data brokers and other privacy issues.

“This sounds to me like a clever work-around to make it as hard as possible for consumers to find it,” Schwartz said.

After The Markup and CalMatters contacted the data brokers, seven said they would review the code on their websites or remove it entirely, and another two said they had independently deleted the code before being contacted. The Markup and CalMatters confirmed eight of the nine companies removed the code.

Two companies said they added the code intentionally to avoid spam at the recommendation of experts and would not change it. The other 24 companies didn't respond to a request for comment; however, three removed the code after The Markup and CalMatters contacted them.

(See the data on our GitHub repo.)

Most of the companies that did respond said they were unaware the code was on their pages.

“The presence of the [code] on our opt-out page was indeed an oversight and not intentional,” May Haddad, a spokesperson for data company FourthWall, said in an emailed response. “Our team promptly rectified the issue upon being informed. As a standard practice, all critical pages—including opt-out and privacy pages—are intended to be indexed by default to ensure maximum visibility and accessibility.” The Markup and CalMatters confirmed that the code had been removed as of July 31.

Some companies that hid their privacy instructions from search engines included a small link at the bottom of their homepage. Accessing it often required scrolling multiple screens, dismissing pop-ups for cookie permissions and newsletter sign-ups, then finding a link that was a fraction the size of other text on the page.

So consumers still faced a serious hurdle when trying to get their information deleted.

Take the simple opt-out form for ipapi, a service offered by Kloudend that finds the physical locations of internet visitors based on their IP addresses. People can go to the company's website to request that the company “Do Not Sell” their personal data or to invoke their “Right to Delete” it—but they would have had trouble finding the form, since it contained code excluding it from search results. A spokesperson for Kloudend described the code as an “oversight” and said the page had been changed to be visible to search engines; The Markup and CalMatters confirmed that the code had been removed as of July 31.

Telesign, a company that advertises fraud-prevention services for businesses, offers a simple form for “Data Deletion” and “Opt Out / Do Not Sell.” But that form is hidden from search engines and other automated systems and isn't linked on its homepage.

Instead, consumers must search about 7,000 words into a privacy policy filled with legalese to find a link to the page.

A spokesperson for Telesign didn't respond to a request for comment.

Five of the pages listed in the California registry not only aren't indexed for search, they don't exist. For example, a company called BrightCheck, which offers “AI-driven identity verification,” lists a privacy instructions page on the California registry. But when The Markup and CalMatters visited the page in late July, we found a notice that the page no longer exists. The page was there on March 18 when The Markup and CalMatters first scanned the site, and the Wayback Machine has an archive of the page from February 14.

BrightCheck didn't respond to a request for comment.

The California Consumer Privacy Act went into effect in 2020, governing companies that make most of their revenue from selling consumer data or who make more than $25 million per year or handle the data of more than 100,000 people in the state. With no comprehensive federal privacy law, the law is among the few regulations data brokers must comply with.

California's most recent broker database lists nearly 500 companies, most of which consumers have likely never heard of. They include businesses with zippy startup names like StatSocial and UpLead, and they offer everything from email marketing tools to contact directories. CalMatters last year published a guide with information on how consumers can exercise their rights using the database or third-party tools and on how they can request deletion of their children' s information.

Tom Kemp, executive director of the entity tasked with enforcing the privacy law, the California Privacy Protection Agency, said in an interview that the agency had reproduced The Markup and CalMatters' findings. While he declined to comment on any particular company's practices, he pointed to an enforcement advisory from the agency on “dark patterns,” which are design choices that have “the substantial effect of subverting or impairing a consumer's autonomy, decisionmaking, or choice.”

If a company makes it much more difficult to choose to remove their personal data than to contribute it, or includes excessive jargon or other hurdles for consumers to jump through to remove it, according to the advisory, they might be violating the law.

This year, the privacy agency has taken enforcement action against companies including Todd Snyder and Honda for, among other violations, making it too difficult to choose to not have their data used. Todd Snyder paid a nearly $350,000 fine this year, while Honda agreed to pay more than $630,000. Both agreed to overhaul their privacy practices.

Kemp said that, when determining whether a company has violated the privacy act, it's important to determine whether there's a pattern of activity making it difficult for consumers to exercise their rights. Hiding a privacy instructions page could be the first “thread” in determining whether a company is shirking their obligations.

In the past, other companies have been criticized for hiding important web pages from search engines. In 2019, ProPublica revealed how the company behind tax filing service TurboTax added code to effectively hide an option for users to file their taxes for free. A 2021 report from the Wall Street Journal found that hospitals were hiding prices they were required to post under federal transparency rules.

Recognizing that most Californians have never heard of the hundreds of companies in the data broker registry, lawmakers in California recently passed the Delete Act. The law will create a system called the Delete Request and Opt-out Platform, or DROP, which will allow consumers in California to send a single, legally binding request to all data brokers on the registry at one time.

In the course of our investigation, we made adjustments to some URLs in California's registry. For 64 sites, we removed “www.” from the beginning of the domain name to resolve server errors.

Technology has become a keystone for making schools safe for kids these days. It's appearing everywhere, even in things as simple as the visitors' sign-in sheet.

“While many schools have paper log visitor management, we continue to see an increase in using electronic visitor management that can track visitors and cross-check them against national databases, like the sex offender registry,” Jordan Ferrantelli, vice president of the health care, education and life safety practice at Guidepost Solutions, a global investigations, compliance, and security consulting firm, told TechNewsWorld.

“One of the technologies that I'm seeing implemented more and more — and that has one of the best returns on investment for schools — is visitor management,” added Adam Coughran, president of Safe Kids, in Newport Beach, Calif., an organization that teaches elementary, middle, and high school students how to respond to life-threatening events.

“Over the years, visitor management has ranged from simply knowing the faces that walk into the school, to a pen and paper on a clipboard, writing down a name and check-in/check-out time,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Now, technology has advanced visitor management to allow mini background checks when people check in. This ensures they're not a sex offender or otherwise restricted from being on campus.”

“It also manages custodial rights — knowing who has the legal right to pick up a child and when,” he added.

Ferrantelli noted that there is growing adoption of technologies like gunshot detection systems and the use of camera analytics to identify weapons.

Metal detectors, though, appear to be one technology schools have drifted away from. “Schools don't want to go that far. They don't want to look like prisons,” said Tom McDermott, K-12 safety and security coach and market manager at CEIA USA, a provider of electromagnetic inspection systems, headquartered in Hudson, Ohio.

There's also a practical reason for eschewing metal detectors. “The kids have to get to class on time,” he told TechNewsWorld. “If they had to go through a metal detector, they'd probably have to get to school an hour earlier than they do now.”

“There are a growing number of commercial, government, and nonprofit technologies that intend to increase school safety,” Elyse Thulin, an assistant research professor at the University of Michigan's Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention, told TechNewsWorld.

Among those technologies, she cited monitoring activity through integrated software on student devices, apps for bystander reporting, and technology that controls access to physical structures, such as swipe cards that automatically lock doors.

“School districts and schools are encouraging kids to have an app on their devices so if they see something — a threat or they're being bullied — they can report it through the app to the school,” McDermott explained.

“In most mass casualty and mass shooting events, people saw things with a student or individual, but didn't do anything about it, so I highly recommend reporting software like that for kids,” he said.

Another safety technology gaining in popularity is panic buttons. “Panic buttons, or duress alarms, are a growing and affordable safety tool,” said Justin Kelley, vice president of global operations at Allied Universal, a multinational private security and facility services company.

“They allow for real-time communication and pinpoint the location of an incident, whether it's a fight, a medical emergency, or another urgent situation,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“These systems can alert administrators and first responders without the need for a phone call, which is especially important in an active threat scenario where you don't want to draw attention to yourself,” he continued. “In multi-building or multi-level schools,” he added, “these alarms can identify the exact room where help is needed. It's technology that's worth the investment.”

Operating some panic buttons can be challenging, though, when they depend on a smartphone to make a 911 call, and a school has a no-phone policy in place. However, Kenny Kelley, CEO of Silent Beacon, a personal safety technology company in Rockville, Md., pointed out that those policies apply only to students.

“For faculty, this is quite popular because panic buttons are required in some states now,” he told TechNewsWorld. “One of the latest ones was Texas, which requires faculty, security, teachers, and admins to have physical panic buttons that can call 911 directly.”

Keeping up with technology can be challenging for cash-strapped public entities like school systems. Allied Universal's Kelley recommends that systems with tight budgets focus on a layered system. First, install a robust camera network that covers both exterior and interior spaces. “And make sure it's actively monitored,” he said. “Cameras don't help if no one's watching.”

Second, implement access control, he continued. Require student ID badging and reduce the number of entry and exit points. “In the late '90s, schools often had 30 to 40 open doors,” he explained. “Now, funneling everyone through a limited number of controlled entrances allows for effective screening without causing major delays.”

“Basic upgrades to camera systems can now include AI features like facial recognition or weapon detection,” he added, “but for schools on a tight budget, cameras and access control are the starting point.”

When considering technology and safety in the schools, it's important to look beyond the physical boundaries of the school, argued Jacqueline Nesi, a clinical psychologist and digital wellness expert, who is working with Straight Talk Wireless on a customizable agreement that helps parents and kids lay the groundwork for healthy digital habits.

“Technology plays an increasingly important role in school safety, from emergency communication systems to digital monitoring tools that help identify potential threats or student distress,” she told TechNewsWorld. “However, one aspect that often gets overlooked in school safety discussions is the critical foundation that begins at home — how families approach digital agreements and technology boundaries.”

“The challenge many schools face is that technology-related safety issues, from cyberbullying to inappropriate content sharing, often originate outside school hours, but significantly impact the school environment,” she said. “This is why family-centered digital wellness initiatives are becoming so important to overall school safety strategies.”

Brent Cobb, CEO of Centegix, maker of wearable safety technology for K-12 education, in Atlanta, noted that for some time, conversations around school safety have portrayed schools as vulnerable environments. “I believe that this narrative is shifting — schools will increasingly be recognized as some of the most prepared, responsive, and resilient public spaces in the country,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“As schools invest in safety infrastructure,” he added, “they provide more than just physical protection — they offer peace of mind. When educators and students trust that their environment is secure, they can focus on what really matters: teaching and learning.”

REDMOND, Wash. — The first crewed flight around the moon in more than 50 years is still months away, but NASA is already saying thank you to L3Harris Technologies' Aerojet Rocketdyne segment and other suppliers who are making the trip possible.

Today, NASA's road trip brought agency officials — plus astronaut Woody Hoburg — to the L3Harris facility in Redmond, which has contributed propulsion systems to NASA missions ranging from space shuttle flights to the Voyager probes' journeys to the edge of the solar system.

Now NASA is getting ready to launch four astronauts on a round-the-moon mission known as Artemis 2, powered in part by hardware built in Redmond. Hoburg, who spent six months on the International Space Station in 2023 and is awaiting his next crew assignment, told an audience of about 200 L3Harris employees and VIPs that the Artemis 2 crew is well aware of the company's contribution.

“They're depending on you, and they know they can count on you,” he said. “Thank you for all the hard work you're doing to make this amazing adventure possible.”

The Artemis 2 mission is currently targeted for launch next April, or perhaps even earlier, said Howard Hu, NASA's program manager for the Orion crew vehicle. The mission after that, Artemis 3, is due to lift off no earlier than mid-2027 with the goal of landing astronauts on the lunar surface for the first time since Apollo 17 in 1972.

L3Harris' Aerojet Redmond team delivered the hardware for those two Artemis missions — including auxiliary engines for Orion's European-built service module — years ago. Now the team is working on thrusters for missions as far out as Artemis 8, which is scheduled to go the moon no earlier than 2033.

With the advent of the Trump administration and new management at NASA, the long-term plan for crewed moon missions has been in flux. 

The White House initially sought to cancel the Space Launch System and Orion programs after Artemis 3, and instead focus on a commercial alternative for Mars missions, such as SpaceX's Starship launch system. But Congress voted to stay the course — and Don Mahr, director of program management at L3Harris' Redmond facility, told GeekWire that NASA has told its suppliers to continue executing the current plan, at least for now.

Amit Kshatriya, NASA's deputy associate administrator for the Moon to Mars Program, said propulsion systems from L3Harris will continue to be essential components in NASA's toolbox even if the long-term plan for Artemis changes. 

“It's the wrong argument to think about picking one thing or another,” he said. “The right argument is, how do we stimulate and create missions and capability across the country in all sorts of different capability classes.”

Kshatriya said that NASA's needs are almost certain to change “five years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now,” and that L3Harris has demonstrated it'll be able to keep up.

“A shop like this is the DNA that we need to keep going, which is why we're so excited to be here,” he said.

Hoburg is excited as well. “We're using the moon as a proving ground to figure out how to get to Mars, so it's a really exciting time,” he said. “And the Artemis 2 crew that's embarking on this mission, they're the pathfinders that are starting a sequence of missions. … It's going to be the next step in space.”

Does Hoburg want to go to the moon? His answer was diplomatic. “I want the United States of America to go to the moon,” he told GeekWire. “It is time to do it. I would love to get to fly one of those missions myself, but I'm proud of our country that we're leading and executing these missions.”

During today's thank-you gathering in Redmond, four L3Harris Aerojet employees received awards from NASA for their contributions to the Artemis program. Brett Mendenhall and Richard Mirabella were given NASA's Silver Snoopy Award, which must be pinned onto the winner's lapel by an astronaut. “That was the part where I try not to draw any blood,” Hoburg quipped.

Camille Samonte received the NASA Space Flight Awareness Trailblazer Award, and Cory Houck won the SFA Management Award.

The Allen Institute for AI released a new AI robotics system that uses novel approaches to help robots navigate messy real-world environments, while making all of the model's code, data, and training methods publicly available under open-source principles.

The system, called MolmoAct, converts 2D images into 3D visualizations, previews its movements before acting, and lets human operators adjust those actions in real time. It differs from existing robotics models that often work as opaque black boxes, trained on proprietary datasets.

Ai2 expects the system to be used by robotics researchers, companies, and developers as a foundation for building robots that can operate in unstructured environments such as homes, warehouses, and disaster response scenes.

In demos last week at Ai2's new headquarters north of Seattle's Lake Union, researchers showed MolmoAct interpreting natural language commands to direct a robotic arm to pick up household objects, such as cups and plush toys, and move them to specific locations. 

Researchers described it as part of AI2's broader efforts to create a comprehensive set of open-source AI tools and technologies. The Seattle-based research institute was founded in 2014 by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, and is funded in part by his estate.

Ai2's flagship OLMo large language model is a fully transparent alternative to proprietary systems, with openly available training data, code, and model weights, designed to support research and public accountability in AI development.

The institute's projects are moving in “one big direction” — toward a unified AI model “that can do reasoning and language, that can understand images, videos, that can control a robot, and that can make sense of space and actions,” said Ranjay Krishna, Ai2's research lead for computer vision, and a University of Washington Allen School assistant professor.

MolmoAct builds on AI2's Molmo multimodal AI model — which can understand and describe images — by adding the ability to reason in 3D and direct robot actions.

Since launching in 2016, and being profiled by GeekWire in 2022, Havium has become a full-service platform that handles all of the operational burden associated with single-family rental (SFR) ownership.

Havium launched a full cash management service that handles all payment responsibilities — such as mortgage, taxes, insurance, utilities, HOA dues, etc. — for each Havium property, to insulate clients from such obligations post-acquisition.

Havium was founded by CEO Jamie Nacht, his wife Cristin Nacht, and former CTO Arash Motamedi.

Jamie Nacht said Havium has helped clients acquire about $40 million in rental properties to date and currently manages $25 million under its full-service model.

The company earns revenue by taking a fee on each client transaction and by managing the ongoing operations of each property. 

“We align directly with our clients — when they invest and their assets perform well, so do we,” Nacht said.

Havium operates in seven Pacific Northwest markets and expects to enter two or three new markets by the end of the year.

The startup has raised $590,000 to date, and the new round — funded entirely by angel investors — will fuel continued product development, backend infrastructure improvements, and geographic expansion, according to Nacht.

Anthropic is increasing the amount of information that enterprise customers can send to Claude in a single prompt, part of an effort to attract more developers to the company's popular AI coding models.

For Anthropic's API customers, the company's Claude Sonnet 4 AI model now has a one million token context window — meaning the AI can handle requests as long as 750,000 words, more than the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy, or 75,000 lines of code. That's roughly five times Claude's previous limit (200,000 tokens), and more than double the 400,000 token context window offered by OpenAI's GPT-5.

Long context will also be available for Claude Sonnet 4 through Anthropic's cloud partners, including on Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud's Vertex AI.

Anthropic has built one of the largest enterprise businesses among AI model developers, largely by selling Claude to AI coding platforms such as Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and Anysphere's Cursor. While Claude has become the model of choice among developers, GPT-5 may threaten Anthropic's dominance with its competitive pricing and strong coding performance. Anysphere CEO Michael Truell even helped OpenAI announce the launch of GPT-5, which is now the default AI model for new users in Cursor.

Anthropic's product lead for the Claude platform, Brad Abrams, told TechCrunch in an interview that he expects AI coding platforms to get a “lot of benefit” from this update. When asked if GPT-5 put a dent in Claude's API usage, Abrams downplayed the concern, saying he's “really happy with the API business and the way it's been growing.”

Whereas OpenAI generates most of its revenue from consumer subscriptions to ChatGPT, Anthropic's business centers around selling AI models to enterprises through an API. That's made AI coding platforms a key customer for Anthropic, and could be why the company is throwing in some new perks to attract users in the face of GPT-5.

Last week, Anthropic unveiled an updated version of its largest AI model, Claude Opus 4.1, which pushed the company's AI coding capabilities a bit further. 

Generally speaking, AI models tend to perform better on all tasks when they have more context, but especially for software engineering problems. For example, if you ask an AI model to spin up a new feature for your app, it's likely to do a better job if it can see the entire project, rather than just a small section.

Abrams also told TechCrunch that Claude's large context window helps it perform better at long agentic coding tasks, in which the AI model is autonomously working on a problem for minutes or hours. With a large context window, Claude can remember all its previous steps in long-horizon tasks.

But some companies have taken large context windows to an extreme, claiming their AI models can process massive prompts. Google offers a 2 million token context window for Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Meta offers a 10 million token context window for Llama 4 Scout.

Some studies suggest there's a limit to how effective large context windows can be; AI models are not great at processing those massive prompts. Abrams said that Anthropic's research team focused on increasing not just the context window for Claude, but the “effective context window,” suggesting that its AI can understand most of the information it's given. However, he declined to reveal Anthropic's exact techniques.

When prompts to Claude Sonnet 4 are over 200,000 tokens, Anthropic will charge more to API users, at $6 per million input tokens and $22.50 per million output tokens (up from $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens).

Google is rolling out a new feature called “Preferred Sources” in the U.S. and India, which allows users to select their preferred choice of news sites and blogs to be shown in the Top Stories section of Google's search results. Enabling this feature means you will see more content from the sites you like, the company says.

When users search for a particular topic, they will see a “star” icon next to the Top Stories section. They can tap on that icon and start adding sources by searching for them. 

Once you select the sources, you can refresh the results to see more content from your selected sources. Google said that for some queries, users will also see a separate “From your sources” section below the Top Stories section.

This feature enables users to get information from sources they like, but that would also likely trap them in an ideological bubble without exposing them to different points of view on a particular topic. 

Google debuted this feature as a Search Labs feature on an experimental basis, so users had to opt in to enable it. The company said that during the test phase, more than half of the users selected four or more sources.

Now, the company is making it available to all users for English language searches in the U.S. and India.

Epic Games has just secured a win in its crusade against Apple and Google's app store policies: The Federal Court of Australia on Tuesday ruled that Apple and Google engaged in anti-competitive conduct when it came to their respective app stores, ABC News reported.

While Judge Jonathan Beach found that the two tech giants had abused their dominant position in the market for app distribution to limit competition, he rejected Epic's claims that the companies had engaged in “unconscionable conduct.”

Epic Games has been fighting Apple and Google's fee structure for in-app purchases in various jurisdictions around the planet. The company scored a major win against Apple this year in the U.S., and as a result, Fortnite returned to Apple's U.S. App Store after five years.

Tuesday's ruling could yield a similar result for Epic in Australia: The company's CEO Tim Sweeny said that the Epic Games Store and Fortnite would return to the Apple App Store in the country soon.

“We welcome the court's rejection of Epic's demands that we distribute app stores from within the Google Play store, and Epic's attacks on other critical security protections that users rely on. However, we disagree with the court's characterisation of our billing policies and practices, as well as its findings regarding some of our historical partnerships,” a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

Meanwhile, Apple told ABC News that its app store is the safest way for users to get apps, and that it disagreed with the court's ruling on some of Epic's claims.

Amid the rise of new AI-powered low code developer tools aimed at hobbyists and non-technical folks, Uno Platform is doubling down on enterprise developers instead.

Montreal-based Uno Platform offers a suite of enterprise-grade tools for developers to build cross-platform .NET applications that can be supported on Android, Apple, Linux, and Windows systems. Users code an application once and Uno Platform makes it easy to ship other types of applications from the existing codebase.

“If you're coding something once and it works on five different platforms on desktop, web, and mobile, you're getting 5x the productivity already,” Uno Platform co-founder and CEO Francois Tanguay told TechCrunch.

Uno Platform is not the only app developer tool platform available, but Tanguay thinks it stands out in a market flooded by vibe coding platforms like Lovable and Cursor. For Tanguay, enterprise developers should have access to productivity tools too.

“Everything we are shipping hasn't been done before and we like we have a clear road map in terms of how we can add those extra capabilities make everybody 10x faster,” Tanguay said. “Nobody's capturing that market yet in the enterprise space.”

The two-year-old startup's enterprise focus has attracted customers and investors. Uno Platform just raised a C$3.5 million ($2.54 million) seed funding round co-led by AQC Capital and Desjardins Capital with participation from Scott Hanselman, the vice president of Microsoft's developer community, in addition to other angel investors.

The capital will help Uno roll out its premium tooling tier, Uno Platform Studio, and new feature, “Hot Design” which allows developers to pause a running application and change its user interface in real time.

Tanguay said they wanted to build Uno Platform to be as seamless to use and helpful as working with an consulting agency, which is exactly how the company got started in the first place.

Tanguay founded Nventive in 2008 as a consulting agency to build apps for companies right as apps were becoming the next hot technology. After a few years, Nventive started developing the suite of tools that eventually became Uno Platform because the agency was looking for ways to make itself more efficient, Tanguay said.

Nventive launched Uno Platform as an open source toolbox in 2018. The open source community could help the agency keep up with frequently changing operating systems that were constantly releasing new versions that required Uno Platform to tweak its offerings.

“We have over a hundred million downloads of platform, something we wouldn't have been able to do just by ourselves,” Tanguay said. “It was really betting on the open source, as a community, to help grow that initiative and bet that others would see the same value in having access to a toolbox like this.”

Tanguay was right and the company has more than 300 open source contributors. Nventive decided to fully spin out the tool box and created Uno Platform in 2023. Since then, the company has started working with enterprise customers, including Toyota, Microsoft and TradeZero, among others.

Longing for the nostalgia of watching home movies, like in the VHS days, but stuck with all your personal videos saved on an iPhone? Sure, you can AirPlay them to the TV, but the experience is not the same. This struggle inspired developer Devin Davies to create Cassette, a new iOS app that plays back videos in a format similar to VHS, making your iPhone videos feel more like old home recordings.

To use the app, you virtually “load” one of the tapes laid out across the screen by selecting the year's videos you want to view. The videos are labeled with what look like handwritten stickers with the year attached to the VHS tape's cover sleeve. 

You can then watch your life unfold on the screen with no further interaction required on your part. 

This lean-back experience introduces a new way to consume the media you have saved on your device, which is often left unviewed after the initial recording. 

The idea for Cassette was prompted by Davies' friend and fellow app developer Charlie Chapman, who is also a senior advocate at RevenueCat, a platform that helps mobile app developers manage in-app purchases and subscriptions. Chapman complained in a group chat about how watching home movies as a family today just wasn't the same as it used to be when watching old family videotapes.

He said he wished there was a way to AirPlay videos to the TV and then have them immediately play one after the other.

Davies, best known for his award-winning recipe app Crouton, jumped on the idea, hacking together Cassette from a custom slideshow app he had made for Apple TV. He later shared a test build with the group chat.

“I kid you not, the entire group chat had this profound experience with our partners where we stayed up all night watching our kids grow up before our eyes,” Chapman told TechCrunch. “I've never experienced ‘product market fit,' or whatever you want to call it, like this before,” he said. 

The app itself offers a clever and simple design, where you're presented with rows of VHS tapes, in all their retro splendor. You tap on one to virtually “load” it into the TV icon at the top of the iPhone's screen to start playing the video. With AirPlay, you can also mirror your device to a TV to watch the full experience play out on the big screen.

The videos themselves include a location, date, and timestamp displayed in a retro pixel font that looks like the old screen fonts used on VHS tapes. (Even if you're too young to remember VHS tapes, seeing old videos in this format pulls on the heartstrings. That could be because old home movies are still regularly referenced in modern movies and TV shows during sentimental moments and scenes.)

In practice, there were some challenges that the app still needs to overcome. 

If you have a habit of downloading online videos, like TikToks or Reels, these will show up among your “home movies.” However, Davies tells TechCrunch that the app is already filtering out screen recordings, and he's now looking to see if TikTok videos could be filtered out, too. 

To support its development, Cassette offers an optional premium subscription (dubbed “ColorPlus”) that allows users to manually select a VHS tape instead of having the app play a video at random. This costs either $0.99 per month or $5.99 per year. There's also an affordable Lifetime unlock for $7.99, which can go a long way toward supporting indie projects like this.

The app is a free download for iPhone and iPad.

It really isn't. I said as much in the previous thread, but the part that elevates this past the typical petty Musk behavior was the accusation that the car was bricked while it was being driven.  That goes way past anything Tesla or Musk has done before and could easily have killed someone.  Doing that doesn't just require an asshole CEO, it would require incompetence of both the legal and technical folks at the company who would actually implement this type of haphazard remote disabling.

I've implemented limp modes before and the easiest way is to prevent acceleration to over a certain speed without enabling regen. If you're already at highway speeds, you'll simply coast down to the limp speed and have plenty of time to pull over.I suspect that wouldn't fall afoul of FMVSS either, but it's never come up for me.

Something like ""a crazy coincidence or wild prank"" made to look real and genuine is not particularly sinister. I personally have briefly put way to much stock in a screenshot of a Tweet from an unattributed anonymous poster alleging X happened. Simply because ""it feels true"" and confirms my bias.

In reality, people who believed this probably think Elon is a petty tyrant and don't like his politics. I agree with them, especially on the first point. The difference is that they either allow this to overwhelm their critical thinking skills, or never had any to begin with.

But Elon Musk has made himself the face of Tesla, used that power in other contexts to go after critics, and the Cybertruck had a bizarre anti resale clause when released and Tesla have made a habit of features-as-a-service with remote software deactivations when other vehicles are resold.So in the specific case here, the reaction very much represents a big brand sentiment problem attributable to concrete issues.

More seriously, the correct reaction to a fake is to adjust towards whatever the fake is moving your away from. If the fake wants you to believe Tesla is a company that will brick your car while driving — adjust towards it being more likely that they won't, because if it were, there would be no need to fake it.Saying instead “huh, I guess my priors were right all along because of how many people believed it” is…yeah, an interesting way of thinking.

Surely there were a bunch of automotive engineers on Reddit getting downvoted to oblivion for suggesting that this doesn't pass a sniff test because it arguably violates subsection 69 of FMVSS 420 or that they don't need to do that because industry standard is to just prevent the car from starting next time, or whatever.

It did break prioritization in the opinion of the ground level teams and their goals but I argue it's not bad to at least periodically do this since grating against the current org structure prioritization and goals is not a bad thing to do on occasion.Chances are they'll find there's no team that considers themselves the owners of spell check or spam filtering and the goals the keyboard team are going for is likely some silly thing like ""number of sentences with correct punctuation"" leading to the current ridiculous outcomes where the period in the URL is way too prominent, especially considering we don't even type full URLS into the search bar that often these days.Dear Apple leads: if you're reading this do a short initiative where execs aim to file an annoyance a day. It's not hard to find such. There will be some complaints at the ground level that these executive annoyances get too much priority but part of that will be because you're questioning lower level org priorities (a healthy thing to do!), not because the issues don't matter. The end result will bring Apple a bit more in line with the quality we saw during the Jobs period since this is exactly the kind of shake up he did on occasion.

Actually, come to think of it, the problem must be a bit easier than on smartphones, right? Real keyboard input is very precise. Smartphone keyboards already guess what word you were trying to spell, so they are influencing the typos in the direction  of likely words… cannibalizing the very guess list that the dictionary uses!

Since ""typo"" comes from ""typography"", it roughly means ""symbolic"". So ""typoglycemia"" should mean ""symbolic sugar of the blood"".

It still is. The spell checker on my Android phone is a PIA. It's too dumb to correct many typos, there's no way of highlighting wrongly used but correct words such a 'fro' and 'for', etc. There's no automatic or user defined substitution such as correcting 'rhe' with 'the' and yet keep the words highlighted until a final revision.Wordpossessor spellers have no way of tagging certain words that one may or may not wish to use depending on context. A classic example that's caught me out past the draft and found its way into the final document without me noticing it is 'pubic' for 'public'. Why doesn't my speller highlight such words in red and ask whether I actually meant to use this word?Moreover, spellers are not all of the same level of accuracy, for example Microsoft Word's speller is much better than LibrOffice's much to my annoyance as LibreOffice is my main (preferred) WP.Nor is there a method of collecting misspelled words or typos and tagging them as spelling errors or typos for the purpose of helping one's spelling or typing. It'd be nice to have a list of my misspelled words together with their correct spelling, that way I could become a better speller. Also, spellers could be integrated with full dictionaries—highlight the word and press F1 for its meaning, etc.There are no dictionary formats that are both universal and smart, that is that would allow for easy amalgamation between dictionaries and yet could contain user defined words and other user metadata which would be distinguished from the general corpus of words when crossed or amalgamated. For example, a smart dictionary format could contain metadata that would allow a dictionary and thesaurus to coexist in the same word list, similarly so different dictionaries, technical, medical etc.All up, spellers are still a damn mess. They need urgent attention.

Instead of how LLMs operate by taking the current text and taking the most likely next token, you take your full text and use an LLM to find the likeliness/rank of each token. I'd imagine this creates a heatmap that shows which parts are the most 'surprising'.You wouldn't catch all misspelling, but it could be very useful information to find what flows and what doesn't - or perhaps explicitly go looking for something out of the norm to capture attention.

This should also be pretty cheap (just one pass through the LLM).

I constantly type ""form"" instead of ""from"" for example and spelling checkers don't help at all. Even a simple LLM could easily notice out of place words like that. And LLMs also could easily go further and do grammar and style checking.

It seems that anything that helps people gets this reaction these days. On the one hand, the argument 100% resonates with me. On the other hand, spelling isn't really the end, is it? It's just a means to an end, so what's wrong with making the mean easier? Did people worry that you'd stop knowing how to plant potatoes when trading was invented? EDIT: The example doesn't make sense because agriculture is newer than trading, but you got the idea.

I'd argue that negative people where correct. People can't spell anymore, not even with a spellchecker. Maybe they never could? I'm not against spellcheckers, I think they are amazing, but they haven't helped much.

Writing a spell checker that quickly identifies if a word is in a list of valid words (the problem described in the article) is a trivial problem for anyone who has basic algorithms and data structure knowledge. It's the classic example for using a trie: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrieThe problem described in the article is doing it within very limited storage space. How do you store your list of 200K words on a system with only 256K of memory? This is the challenging part.

Almost. You needed to clarify what the interviewer was asking and discover requirements. As much as HN likes to hate on coding interviews requiring specific algorithm knowledge, determining requirements is very much part of the job, and engineers have a tendency to build what they want to build, not what the customer wants.

I once built a spell checker plus corrector which had to run in 32kB under a DOS hotkey, interacting with some word processor. On top of that, it had to run from CD ROM, and respond within a second. I could do 4 lookups, in blocks of 8kB, which gave me the option to look up the word in normal order, in reverse order, and a phonetic transcription in both directions. Each 8kB block contained quite a few words, can't remember how many. Then counting the similarities, and returning them as a sorted list. It wasn't perfect, but worked reasonably well.[1] Adding that for professional spell checking you'd need at least 100k lemmata plus all inflections plus information per word if you have to accept compounds/agglutination.

- Contests will often be won not by the entry that best adhered to the prompt, but the best-looking one. This happened in the contest ""Input Prompt
Build a brutalist website to a typeface maker,"" which I got as a recent example. The winning entry had megawatt-bright magenta and yellow, which shouldn't appear anywhere near brutalism, and in other design aspects had almost no connection to brutalism either -- but it was the most attractive of the bunch.- The approach only gets you to a local maximum. Current LLMs aren't very good designers, as you say, so contests will involve picking between mostly middling entries. You'd want a design that's, say, a 9 or a 10 on a 10-point scale -- but some 95% of the entry distribution will probably be between 5.5 and 7.5 or so, and that's what users will get to pick from.

I definitely agree with your second point. One idea we're experimenting with is adding a human baseline, in which the models are benchmarked against human generated designs as well.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","What you may have missed about GPT-5","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/12/1121565/what-you-may-have-missed-about-gpt-5/","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 07:52:23 GMT","

As “general intelligence” remains out of reach, OpenAI is leaning more on application-specific pitches. Health advice is its most dangerous test case.

Before OpenAI released GPT-5 last Thursday, CEO Sam Altman said its capabilities made him feel “useless relative to the AI.” He said working on it carries a weight he imagines the developers of the atom bomb must have felt.

As tech giants converge on models that do more or less the same thing, OpenAI's new offering was supposed to give a glimpse of AI's newest frontier. It was meant to mark a leap toward the “artificial general intelligence” that tech's evangelists have promised will transform humanity for the better. 

Against those expectations, the model has mostly underwhelmed. 

People have highlighted glaring mistakes in GPT-5's responses, countering Altman's claim made at the launch that it works like “a legitimate PhD-level expert in anything any area you need on demand.” Early testers have also found issues with OpenAI's promise that GPT-5 automatically works out what type of AI model is best suited for your question—a reasoning model for more complicated queries, or a faster model for simpler ones. Altman seems to have conceded that this feature is flawed and takes away user control. However there is good news too: the model seems to have eased the problem of ChatGPT sucking up to users, with GPT-5 less likely to shower them with over the top compliments.

Overall, as my colleague Grace Huckins pointed out, the new release represents more of a product update—providing slicker and prettier ways of conversing with ChatGPT—than a breakthrough that reshapes what is possible in AI. 

But there's one other thing to take from all this. For a while, AI companies didn't make much effort to suggest how their models might be used. Instead, the plan was to simply build the smartest model possible—a brain of sorts—and trust that it would be good at lots of things. Writing poetry would come as naturally as organic chemistry. Getting there would be accomplished by bigger models, better training techniques, and technical breakthroughs. 

That has been changing: The play now is to push existing models into more places by hyping up specific applications. Companies have been more aggressive in their promises that their AI models can replace human coders, for example (even if the early evidence suggests otherwise). A possible explanation for this pivot is that tech giants simply have not made the breakthroughs they've expected. We might be stuck with only marginal improvements in large language models' capabilities for the time being. That leaves AI companies with one option: Work with what you've got.

The much-hyped release makes several enhancements to the ChatGPT user experience. But it's still far short of AGI.

The starkest example of this in the launch of GPT-5 is how much OpenAI is encouraging people to use it for health advice, one of AI's most fraught arenas. 

In the beginning, OpenAI mostly didn't play ball with medical questions. If you tried to ask ChatGPT about your health, it gave lots of disclaimers warning you that it was not a doctor, and for some questions, it would refuse to give a response at all. But as I recently reported, those disclaimers began disappearing as OpenAI released new models. Its models will now not only interpret x-rays and mammograms for you but ask follow-up questions leading toward a diagnosis.

In May, OpenAI signaled it would try to tackle medical questions head on. It announced HealthBench, a way to evaluate how good AI systems are at handling health topics as measured against the opinions of physicians. In July, it published a study it participated in, reporting that a cohort of doctors in Kenya made fewer diagnostic mistakes when they were helped by an AI model. 

With the launch of GPT-5, OpenAI has begun explicitly telling people to use its models for health advice. At the launch event, Altman welcomed on stage Felipe Millon, an OpenAI employee, and his wife, Carolina Millon, who had recently been diagnosed with multiple forms of cancer. Carolina spoke about asking ChatGPT for help with her diagnoses, saying that she had uploaded copies of her biopsy results to ChatGPT to translate medical jargon and asked the AI for help making decisions about things like whether or not to pursue radiation. The trio called it an empowering example of shrinking the knowledge gap between doctors and patients.

With this change in approach, OpenAI is wading into dangerous waters. 

For one, it's using evidence that doctors can benefit from AI as a clinical tool, as in the Kenya study, to suggest that people without any medical background should ask the AI model for advice about their own health. The problem is that lots of people might ask for this advice without ever running it by a doctor (and are less likely to do so now that the chatbot rarely prompts them to).

Indeed, two days before the launch of GPT-5, the Annals of Internal Medicine published a paper about a man who stopped eating salt and began ingesting dangerous amounts of bromide following a conversation with ChatGPT. He developed bromide poisoning—which largely disappeared in the US after the Food and Drug Administration began curbing the use of bromide in over-the-counter medications in the 1970s—and then nearly died, spending weeks in the hospital. 

So what's the point of all this? Essentially, it's about accountability. When AI companies move from promising general intelligence to offering humanlike helpfulness in a specific field like health care, it raises a second, yet unanswered question about what will happen when mistakes are made. As things stand, there's little indication tech companies will be made liable for the harm caused.

“When doctors give you harmful medical advice due to error or prejudicial bias, you can sue them for malpractice and get recompense,” says Damien Williams, an assistant professor of data science and philosophy at the University of North Carolina Charlotte. 

“When ChatGPT gives you harmful medical advice because it's been trained on prejudicial data, or because ‘hallucinations' are inherent in the operations of the system, what's your recourse?”

A horrific shooting took place outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's headquarters in Atlanta on Friday. The shooting killed one police officer and left the building's staff locked down and terrified. The shooter, who unsuccessfully tried to breach the building, has been identified as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White. He was found dead at the scene.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has not been particularly good at navigating his high-profile position since taking office. His controversial beliefs and his unusual policies have made the bureaucrat a consistent target for criticism, and the events of this weekend proved to be yet another opportunity for Kennedy-related controversy to erupt.

Kennedy posted a public statement about the shooting over the weekend. Before he did that, however, Kennedy notably posted some pictures from a fishing trip to his personal X account. “Fishing the Kenae with Ninilchik Chief Ivan Encelewski Chairman of the Cook Inlet Tribal Council and Council President Gloria Oneil,” Kennedy posted on Saturday morning. Some 30 minutes later, Kennedy posted a statement to his official account expressing sympathy for the traumatized CDC staff: “We are deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at CDC's Atlanta campus that took the life of officer David Rose,” Kennedy wrote. “We stand with his wife and three children and the entire CDC family.”

It's worth noting that public figures aren't always personally responsible for the posts on their social media accounts. It's unclear who is running Kennedy's socials but, whoever they are, they dropped the ball here. Gizmodo reached out to the HHS for comment. An HHS press release published Monday afternoon said that Kennedy had visited the CDC campus where the attack took place and later “met privately with the widow of Officer David Rose, who courageously gave his life in the line of duty.” The statement says that Kennedy “offered his deepest condolences and reaffirmed the agency's commitment to honoring Officer Rose's bravery, sacrifice, and service to the nation.” Kennedy also reached out to staff on Saturday, not long after the shooting took place.

Kennedy's questionable social media choices aren't the only thing he has been criticized for in the wake of the shooting, however. White is alleged to have been preoccupied with the covid-19 vaccine which, according to MSNBC, he “blamed for his health problems,” an assertion that was previously corroborated by CNN's sources. Kennedy has notably spread skepticism about vaccines and fanned the flames of conspiracy theory around the covid pandemic. Several medical organizations recently sued Kennedy over changes he made to the government's vaccination recommendations. When it comes to the recent shooting, NPR has reported that some laid-off CDC employees have even said that “Kennedy shares responsibility for the violence and should resign.”

Kennedy's leadership at the HHS has been subject to ongoing criticism. The MAHA zealot has pursued various fringe agendas (like removing synthetic dyes from cereal and other processed foods and reintroducing tallow into french fries) while moving to cut funding, staffing, and resources to arguably much more important initiatives—including mRNA vaccine development, cancer research, and other vital health programs. Earlier this year, the HHS conducted layoffs at the CDC that reportedly impacted thousands of workers, although some of those workers have since been invited back to the agency.

That shocking finale coda of Hwang Dong-hyuk's Squid Game series left many curious about what it meant for the American spin-off Netflix has in the works. When the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) pauses next to an alley in downtown Los Angeles, you witness, along with him, the Squid Game recruitment ritual being administered by a new face: Cate Blanchett, wearing a suit and offering up the Ddakji slaps.

It's hard to believe the Academy Award-winning actress was only recruited for a one-off cameo right after she claimed to be retired. In an interview with Variety, Blanchett discussed how the guest role came to be and what it might mean for her future in the franchise. “Because it's such a cult series and they were shooting in L.A. of all places, everyone was on a need-to-know basis,” she said of the “out of the blue offer” that stipulated she bring her own suit.

“I got a couple of storyboards. I had to [learn to] play the game very quickly. I had to practice and practice. I knew there were four or five setups that they were going to do, and I knew what they needed from every shot, and then I was given the sides. But it was one of the more mysterious jobs.”

Blanchett explained that while her role was a feature on the series finale, she'd consider returning. “I am wildly open to anything,” she shared with the trade, “and in a world that is so beautifully, magically created like that, for sure. They're amazing world-builders, and that series has been eaten alive. I don't think there's a corner of the globe that it hasn't touched in some way.”

What's so playfully suspicious about her answers is that Netflix has enlisted David Fincher for his take on the American Squid Game spin-off. And he happens to be a filmmaker Blanchett worked with on The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, so what gives? Nothing, apparently, just coincidence. The actress affirmed to Variety, “I mean, I'd love to work with David again. It's been ages. But no, I don't know anything more than you do. I'm not being coy. I really don't.”

With Grok, the months pass, but the story stays the same. The AI chatbot from xAI, Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, continues to stir controversy, putting its host platform, X, in an increasingly embarrassing position.

Just weeks after a version of Grok was found to be praising Adolf Hitler, the new, supposedly more powerful “SuperGrok” found itself in hot water again on Monday, forcing X to briefly suspend the chatbot for what it vaguely described as “inappropriate posts.”

Even Elon Musk seemed exasperated. When a user pointed out the suspension, the tech mogul candidly replied: “Man, we sure shoot ourselves in the foot a lot!”

Man, we sure shoot ourselves in the foot a lot!

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 11, 2025



The chaos surrounding the suspension itself highlighted the chatbot's profound unreliability. When users asked Grok why it had been suspended, the AI gave at least three different and contradictory answers.

In one instance, it offered a generic, corporate-sounding explanation: “Yes, I was briefly suspended due to inappropriate posts, but xAI has removed them and implemented safeguards against hate speech. I'm back and focused on truth-seeking,” the chatbot said.

Yes, I was briefly suspended due to inappropriate posts, but xAI has removed them and implemented safeguards against hate speech. I'm back and focused on truth-seeking.

— Grok (@grok) August 11, 2025



However, other users posted screenshots of a far more specific and politically charged reason: “My account was suspended after I stated that israel and the US. are committing genocide in Gaza. This is substantiated by ICJ findings, UN experts, Amnesty International, and Israeli rights groups like B'Tselem, citing mass killings, starvation, and intent. U.S. complicity via arms support is widely alleged. It's now restored.” Gizmodo could not independently verify these screenshots.

— Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) August 11, 2025



In a third version of events, Grok simply denied anything had happened at all. “No, it's not true. I'm fully operational and unsuspended on X. Rumors like this often spread quickly—likely misinformation. If you have questions, ask away!”

No, it's not true. I'm fully operational and unsuspended on X. Rumors like this often spread quickly—likely misinformation. If you have questions, ask away!

— Grok (@grok) August 11, 2025



The suspension was brief—less than thirty minutes, according to users—but the incident is part of a deeply troubling pattern of incompetence and misinformation. Grok is currently at the center of a major controversy in France after it repeatedly and falsely identified a photo of a malnourished 9-year-old girl in Gaza, taken by an Agence France-Presse (AFP) photographer on August 2, 2025, as being an old photo from Yemen in 2018. The AI's false claim was used by social media accounts to accuse a French lawmaker of spreading disinformation, forcing the renowned news agency to publicly debunk the AI.

The Day Grok Tried to Be Human

According to experts, these aren't just isolated glitches; they are fundamental flaws in the technology. All these large language and image models are “black boxes,” Louis de Diesbach, a technical ethicist, told AFP. He explained that AI models are shaped by their training data and alignment, and they don't learn from mistakes in the way humans do. “Just because they made a mistake once doesn't mean they'll never make it again,” de Diesbach added.

This is especially dangerous for a tool like Grok, which de Diesbach says has “even more pronounced biases, which are very aligned with the ideology promoted, among others, by Elon Musk.”

The problem is that Musk has integrated this flawed and fundamentally unreliable tool directly into a global town square and marketed it as a way to verify information. The failures are becoming a feature, not a bug, with dangerous consequences for public discourse.

X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Elon Musk has opened a fresh front in his ongoing feud with Big Tech.This time he's targeting Apple.

On Monday night, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO accused the iPhone maker of antitrust violations, claiming its App Store policies put his AI chatbot Grok, developed by xAI, at a disadvantage compared to rivals, particularly OpenAI's ChatGPT. “Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,” Musk posted on X (formerly Twitter). “xAI will take immediate legal action.”

xAI will take immediate legal action.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 12, 2025



Musk didn't elaborate on the legal strategy or confirm whether a lawsuit is already in motion. But his public offensive had begun earlier in the evening, as if he were building a case before a jury.

“Hey @Apple App Store, why do you refuse to put either 𝕏 or Grok in your ‘Must Have' section when 𝕏 is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps?” he wrote in another post. “Are you playing politics? What gives? Inquiring minds want to know.”

A quick check by Gizmodo found that ChatGPT is currently the No. 1 free app in the U.S. iOS App Store and the only AI chatbot featured in Apple's “Must-Have Apps” section.

Musk sees that as evidence of bias, and he's tying it to Apple's deeper ties with OpenAI. “And why is ChatGPT literally in every list where you have editorial control?” he added in yet another post.

Apple and OpenAI announced a partnership in June 2024 to integrate ChatGPT into iPhones, iPads, and Macs through Siri and system-wide writing tools. The deal gave OpenAI's chatbot unprecedented visibility and direct access to hundreds of millions of Apple users.

And why is ChatGPT literally in every list where you have editorial control?

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 12, 2025



Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 but left the company three years later after a falling-out, has since become one of its fiercest critics. His AI company, xAI, launched Grok in late 2023, branding it as an “edgy” alternative to mainstream chatbots. Grok is integrated directly into X, the social platform Musk acquired in 2022.

The spat with Apple adds to Musk's growing list of AI-related battles,  including lawsuits, public feuds with former allies, and frequent claims that competitors are politically biased.

Musk's threat marks the opening salvo in what could become a major new antitrust fight. Apple has long faced scrutiny and lawsuits  from developers such as Epic Games, as well as regulators in the U.S. and Europe, who argue that its iron grip on the App Store amounts to an illegal monopoly.

Now, Musk is repurposing those same arguments for the AI era. His complaint targets the core of Apple's App Store power: the ability to anoint winners and bury rivals through editorial curation and promotion. For an upstart like xAI, being sidelined while a competitor enjoys premium placement can be fatal.

In Musk's view, Apple's promotion of ChatGPT is part of a cozy, potentially anti-competitive relationship with OpenAI.

Apple did not immediately respond to Gizmodo's request for comment.

It's Musk's classic strong arm move. He's done it before, yell loud enough, play the bully, and force your rival to the table. Now the question is whether Apple takes the bait or calls his bluff.

AI company Perplexity has offered to buy Google's Chrome browser for $34.5 billion, according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal. The offer is being characterized as a “longshot,” especially since Perplexity itself is only valued at about $18 billion, according to the newspaper, but the idea is rooted in a very real problem for Google: A judge is currently considering whether Google's parent company Alphabet should be forced to sell Chrome over antitrust concerns.

Perplexity told the Journal that it had investors lined up, including large venture-capital funds. The newspaper reports that Perplexity's offer was “designed to satisfy an antitrust remedy in highest public interest by placing Chrome with a capable, independent operator,” in the AI company's words. But Alphabet, under CEO Sundar Pichai, has resisted proposals to sell off Chrome.

Other companies like OpenAI have previously floated interest in buying Chrome, though none of the big players have made a large public move like Perplexity. Neither Google nor Perplexity responded to questions from Gizmodo emailed Tuesday morning.

Google Chrome has about 3.5 billion users, which is an incredible market share when you remember that there are only about 8.1 billion people on the planet. The U.S. Justice Department first sued Google in 2020 over allegations of monopolistic behavior, and U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled in the summer of 2024 that the tech giant really was a monopoly. “Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” Mehta wrote at the time. The question is what you do about it.

Perplexity recently launched its own browser called Comet, which injects more generative artificial intelligence into the browser experience. But there's disagreement among AI enthusiasts about whether browsers are actually the future of the AI experience. Many futurists imagine the traditional web browser won't even be a thing a decade from now. And AI skeptics are quick to point out just how unreliable AI can be when you ask it difficult questions.

Lawsuits against Google sped up in recent years over its alleged antitrust behavior, both in Europe and the U.S. In 2023, the DOJ said Google had engaged in “anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct,” and President Joe Biden's Attorney General, Merrick B. Garland, said the lawsuits against Google were about protecting consumers and safeguarding competition.

Judge Metha is expected to rule sometime this month about the remedy for Google's monopoly. And while it's not clear what the judge will decide, he'll no doubt take notice of Perplexity's offer.

We need an affordable MacBook, now more than ever. It's time to face the fact that today's headlining laptop chips are overkill for what most folk need a computer for. If the majority of internet users are browsing the internet on phones that cost $200 or $400 less than the cheapest MacBook Air, it only makes sense to put a mobile chip into a laptop shell and call it a day. New rumors suggest that Apple could do just that, and we could see this cheapo Mac before the end of the year.

Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, a semi-reliable source for upcoming Apple products, proposed the Mac maker was on the road to a cheaper MacBook. A new report from DigiTimes Asia (spotted by MacRumors) adds fuel to that kindling rumor. The site reported, based on anonymous “supply chain sources,” that there's a 12.9-inch MacBook in the works that could hit the scene this year. Better yet, it will cost between $600 and $700. The reason it will go for close to $400 under the current MacBook Air M4 is because it will use one of Apple's A-series mobile chips, likely the A18 Pro found on the iPhone 16 Pro, rather than Apple's M-series silicon.

See MacBook Air M4 at Amazon

The next MacBook would be slightly smaller in size compared to a MacBook Air with a 13.6-inch display. If Apple does manage to push out this cheapo Mac, it likely won't be here until the tail end of the year. Recent rumors from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman suggest Apple could push its next MacBook Pros to 2026. A cheap MacBook would be one way to fill the gap in its release schedule. In the meantime, today's iPads are also split between devices like the iPad mini with an A17 Pro chip and the iPad Air and iPad Pro with M-series silicon. It makes sense for Apple to split up its laptops in the same way.

Apple's current cheap iPhone, the iPhone 16e, lacks some of the modern amenities of today's iPhones, like the Dynamic Island and wireless MagSafe charging. A cheap MacBook would likely sport a basic IPS LCD panel and very few I/O ports. It could feature lower resolutions of earlier Intel-based MacBooks like the discontinued 12-inch MacBook. No matter what, its main selling point will be its affordability. Apple would allow users to access the new macOS 26 features alongside quality-of-life capabilities like AirDrop and access to iMessage. Today's A18 chips are based on a 3nm process, which in layman's terms means they're very fast and power efficient. As long as you're not looking to play AAA games or work on more-intensive rendering apps, such mobile chips would be perfectly serviceable.

While us computing nerds press our noses to the screen to identify the minute differences between single- and multi-core CPU benchmarks across PC and Mac chip generations, the rest of the world isn't aware or just doesn't care about how powerful their laptop is. Most consumers just want a device that can browse their socials, hit up their favorite apps, and let them type out a few emails. A phone can do all that, and it's small enough to fit in your pocket. U.S. census data shows us that most households use phones as their main computing device. Families who only access the internet via a smartphone normally make much less money as a whole than those with home computers and are much more likely to live below the poverty line. There are some people who have no choice but to opt for cheaper devices. Luckily, with today's variety of chips, cheaper doesn't need to be worse.

We're in a place where affordable laptops don't have to be so much worse. Today's sub-$500 PCs are relatively serviceable, even with low-end Intel and AMD chips. That doesn't mean there isn't a floor for specs that users need to make a laptop worth the money. Today's Chromebook models have been supplemented by the addition of “Chromebook Plus” with minimum specs like 8GB of RAM. Still, even an excellent laptop like Lenovo's Chromebook Plus 14 feels constrained by the focus of cloud-based apps on ChromeOS. If Apple sticks macOS 26 on its cheapo MacBook, users would have access to the full gamut of Mac-enabled features.

Just hours after President Trump confirmed a new deal that will see Nvidia pay 15% of sales revenue to the government in exchange for H20 export licenses, a new Bloomberg report claims that China's government has been urging local companies to avoid using the chips for weeks. Nvidia has hit back and tells us its H20 chip is not for use in military applications or government infrastructure.

Over the weekend, reports claimed that the White House had struck a deal with both Nvidia and AMD that would see the companies share 15% of related revenue in China in exchange for export licenses of previously restricted chips, the H20 and MI308, respectively. Since then, President Trump has confirmed the deal and even hinted that he may permit Nvidia to ship more potent Blackwell AI processors, providing they are nerfed in some regard.

Despite the perceived boon to Nvidia in securing H20 licenses, Bloomberg says that China ""has urged local companies to avoid using Nvidia Corp.'s H20 processors,"" especially for government-related purposes, in a potential blow to the company. According to the report, Chinese authorities have sent notices to firms over the past few weeks ""discouraging use of the less-advanced semiconductors."" The report comes from ""people familiar with the matter,"" and cannot be verified at this stage; however, Bloomberg claims the information comes from interviews with ""more than a half-dozen people."" A similar FT report on Tuesday echoes the development, stating that Beijing is demanding tech companies justify orders of H20 chips instead of domestic alternatives.

The report claims that particularly strong guidance was issued around the use of the H20 chip for government and national security-related work by both state enterprises and private companies. It also briefly mentions that AMD AI accelerators, presumably the aforementioned MI308, are also thought to have been included in the push. According to the report, some letters from the state to companies included a series of questions asking why entities would buy Nvidia H20 chips over local alternatives, ""whether that's a necessary choice given domestic options, and whether they've found any security issues in the Nvidia hardware.""

The concerns reflect recent reports that Chinese state media is pushing the line that H20 GPUs are unsafe and outdated. One state-linked social media account wrote on WeChat, ""When a type of chip is neither environmentally friendly, nor advanced, nor safe, as consumers, we certainly have the option not to buy it.""

Bloomberg claims that the most stringent guidance relates only to sensitive applications, in the same way that Tesla vehicles and iPhones are restricted in certain places in the country. However, at least one source reportedly told the publication that the guidance could be extended.

In a statement, Nvidia told Tom's Hardware: ""As both governments recognize, the H20 is not a military product or for government infrastructure. China has ample supply of domestic chips to meet its needs. It won't and never has relied on American chips for government operations, just like the U.S. government would not rely on chips from China. Banning the sale of H20 in China would only harm U.S. economic and technology leadership with zero national security benefit."" The statement, while addressing China's concerns, seems strange, given that China's reported move against H20 would clearly be motivated, at least in part, by a desire to erode U.S. economic and technology leadership.

As mentioned, the state media concerns were fairly nebulous, simply touting the H20 as unsafe and bad for the environment. More specifically, Bloomberg claims that China's concerns center around location-tracking and remote shutdown of chips, coupled with a broader concern about shifting reliance away from Western offerings. According to Bloomberg, Chinese officials ""are worried that Nvidia chips could have location-tracking and remote shutdown capabilities,"" something Nvidia strenuously denies. In a recent article, Nvidia denounced claims that any of its hardware contains backdoors or kill switches, and vehemently opposed their use in principle. As the report notes, Washington has floated the idea of using georestrictions, including software and hardware-based solutions, to combat chip smuggling.

On the broader note of supply, Bloomberg notes ""Beijing is intensely focused on developing its domestic chip capabilities,"" and cites officials urging Chinese companies to pick homegrown semiconductors.

If China is indeed going on the offensive, urging local companies to steer clear of H20 chips, that could complicate the picture for Nvidia in the region somewhat. Despite initial indications that Nvidia was sitting on enough H20 chips to meet renewed demand — CEO Jensen Huang stated the company would not restart production — a report in late July claimed Nvidia was seeking an extra 300,000 units to meet demand. 

The FT reports that some tech companies are reportedly planning to downsize their oders of H""0 chip following questions from regulators.

A new ‘Guide to comfortable use of the store' asks café visitors to stop bringing in ‘Personal desktops, printers, power strips, partitions, etc.'

Seeing people pecking at their laptop keyboard while they cradle a latte will be a common enough sight at your local Starbucks in the U.S. However, some South Korean folk have managed to outstretch the limits of the coffee chain's hospitality. The Korea Herald reports that “every branch” of Starbucks in the nation has put up signs telling customers that bringing in their desktop PCs, printers, power strips, and even putting up office partitioning, is no longer permitted.

Local news reports suggest that the Starbucks customers with a penchant for bringing their home offices into the café are “a small but persistent group of clients.” The signs urge people to make room for their fellow coffee drinkers, and not to abandon their tech clutter at shared tables for long periods.





Of course, there's already a local word for these busy coffee shop table hogging folks. The Korea Herald says locals call them ‘cagongjok,' which it explains is a portmanteau word blending the Korean words for ‘café' and ‘study tribe.'

In our topmost picture, which the Korea Herald simply credits to social media (X), you can see that a particularly anti-social setup was spotted in a Starbucks in South Korea. We assume the image was originally shared for mirth-making and/or incredulous impact. Not only does this coffee shop visitor have a bulky-looking desktop setup (but where is the system unit?), but they have also constructed an isolating office pod to reduce distractions.

The source report suggests that other Starbucks cagongjoks have been spotted bringing printers, which are typically bulky, as well as power strips to feed their numerous electronics.

South Korea has enjoyed a “massive café boom” in recent years, according to Statistics Korea, which is quoted by the Herald. Latest figures show the number of coffee shops operating in the country have almost doubled, to 100,000, since 2015. It is pointed out that using cafés as study and workspaces has also grown quickly in popularity.

However, long-staying customers “can be costly for owners,” states the source. It cites an industry research institute that estimates a single coffee only covers 1 hour and 42 minutes of seat time before it becomes unprofitable.

 August 11, 2025  

The coronary sinus reducer (CSR), an hourglass-shaped stent that narrows the coronary sinus to increase coronary sinus pressure, has shown some promise in treating patients with refractory angina. But a meta-analysis published today in JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions found the benefits of the intervention are likely smaller than those early studies predicted.

“There have been lots of unblinded single-arm studies [of CSR], but only three randomized controlled trials. We wanted to look at the different effect sizes between the unblinded and blinded studies to better understand the overall potential efficacy of the device,” said Rasha Al-Lamee, MD, a cardiologist at the National Heart and Lung Institute in London, UK, who led the meta-analysis.

Al-Lamee and her colleagues looked at data from a combined total of 180 patients in the three trials, as well as 13 single-arm studies with 668 total patients. They found the coronary sinus procedure to be safe, with a success rate of 98.3%.

But while both the single-arm and the controlled trials demonstrated improvements in symptoms of angina, the effect size was much smaller in the controlled trials.

In the more rigorous trials, 26% of patients experienced at least a one-class improvement and 17% had at least a two-class improvement on the Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification of angina. Those figures were about one third of the gains reported in the single-arm trials. What's more, the randomized controlled trials found no evidence of benefit based on continuous measurements such as the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Nor did they find improvements in objective measures such as myocardial perfusion associated with the intervention.

Deepak Bhatt, MD, a cardiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the journal article, said more treatment options are needed for patients with refractory angina, who have often exhausted all other medical therapies and surgical procedures. But while coronary sinus reduction shows promise, the meta-analysis demonstrates why more, and larger, trials will be needed before clinicians can use it more broadly.

“It's not an inexpensive procedure, so we want substantial, objectively quantified evidence that it helps patients,” he told Medscape Medical News. “History is littered with examples of things we were convinced worked but really didn't.”

Percutaneous laser therapy, for example, seemed to show benefits for refractory angina at first, but more rigorous randomized trials found no benefit from the procedure, he said.

The CSR device is already approved in the UK and Europe and its use is on the rise there, said Al-Lamee, but it has not yet been approved in the US. The ongoing COSIRA-II trial, with an estimated enrollment of 380 patients, will ideally be adequately powered to provide definitive results and support US approval, she said.

Al-Lamee said that, should COSIRA-II show definitive benefit, it may be possible in the future to consider widening the application. Perhaps it could be considered before more high-risk revascularization options. “For example, why offer re-do coronary artery bypass surgery if you can use a device that is effective and much lower risk instead?” she said.

Al-Lamee had received consulting and speaker fees from Shockwave Medical, which makes the CSR device. Bhatt reported no relevant financial conflicts.

 August 12, 2025  

After British Columbia (BC) made long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) free in April 2023, LARC dispensations, which had been declining steadily, went up by 49%, data indicated. The findings underscored the importance of removing the cost barrier for birth control, according to the authors.

The data are particularly important because LARC, which includes intrauterine devices (IUD) and subdermal implants, is the most effective type of contraception, study author Laura Schummers, ScD, assistant professor of health outcomes at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, told Medscape Medical News.

The research was published on July 28 in The BMJ.

“These methods are at least 10 times as effective as other kinds of contraception,” Schummers said. With LARC, “less than 1% of users become pregnant each year of use.” For comparison, the pill, patch, or ring have failure rates near 6%-9%, she noted. In addition, LARC can last for 3-10 years, and its effectiveness does not depend on the user.

More than 40% of pregnancies worldwide are unintended, including 48% of pregnancies in North America, according to the researchers. They examined the numbers of monthly dispensations for all contraception prescriptions, including LARC, in the years before and after a universal contraception coverage policy was instituted in BC in April 2023. Under this policy, the public insurer pays 100% of prescription costs.

The researchers tracked contraception prescriptions that were given to 859,845 reproductive-aged female residents of BC (age, 15-49 years) between April 1, 2021, and June 30, 2024. They compared these prescriptions with those given to a control group derived from the nine other Canadian provinces that did not dispense contraception for free. Without this no-cost intervention, most Canadian insurance plans require copayments, coinsurance, or annual deductibles, and many don't cover contraception at all.

In April 2023, when the new policy took effect, “we saw an immediate increase by over 1050 additional dispensations per month,” Schummers said. “By June 2024, there were almost 1300 additional dispensations per month for LARC that amounted to a 49% increase in what we observed vs what was expected, based on the pre-policy trends. That really tells us there was an unmet need for the most effective forms of contraception and that costs were driving contraceptive choices, as well as contraceptive use overall.”

Upfront costs are likely a barrier to the adoption of LARC, said Schummers. Though prescriptions increased for all forms of contraception, “we found almost all of the increase in use was concentrated in the LARCs,” she said. That difference likely has to do with cost structure. Even though the contraceptive pill is a monthly payment for years, it is a low payment, typically $20-$25. A low payment per month over years may be perceived as easier to pay than the one-time $350-$450 upfront for LARC, said Schummers.

The findings “confirm that this was a smart policy decision,” according to Schummers. They also may help encourage the policy's adoption in other provinces.

Canada is “in a period of evolving discussions about contraception coverage and prescription coverage more generally,” Schummers observed. BC was the first province to make the policy change, and Manitoba, Yukon, and Prince Edward Island have followed suit.

“But the remaining provinces do not yet have an agreement in place,” Schummers said. “Our study provides timely evidence to support those discussions and to guide decisions to follow what BC has done across all the provinces.”

Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Dustin Costescu, MD, obstetrician/gynecologist and family planning specialist in Hamilton, Ontario, said that despite LARC methods' many advantages, many barriers limit its uptake. This study demonstrates the magnitude of the financial barrier and the rapid increase in uptake when it is removed, he said.

“Moving the needle on LARC uptake is not an easy task. With millions of BC residents, increasing LARC uptake by 1.9% means tens of thousands of individuals have accessed an IUD or implant where previously they could not. While not captured in this study, that translates to a reduction of unintended pregnancies, unplanned births, and abortion by a magnitude of thousands.”

One of the reasons the federal government has prioritized universal access to contraception is that access to birth control has demonstrated cost savings globally, Costescu said.

“The work of the authors, many of whom are primarily responsible for the work to build universal coverage in BC, cannot be overstated and demonstrates the need and demand for LARC access in Canada,” he said.

The study was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. Schummers reported having no relevant financial relationships. Costescu reported relationships with Searchlight, Organon, Bayer, and Duchesnay.

A new study shows the glow from tooth whitening often fades within a year, but whether you still love your smile may depend more on your personality than the shade of your teeth.

Study: Effect of personality characteristics on perception of tooth whitening outcome in young adults in long-term: a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. Image credit: PeopleImages.com - Yuri A/Shutterstock.com

Tooth whitening is a common practice, but its effectiveness over the long term remains unclear. Similarly, its impact on psychological and social health is poorly understood. A study published in Head & Face Medicine examined these aspects of tooth whitening over one year to assess how specific personality traits affected the outcomes.

People often feel dissatisfied with tooth color, which inhibits their willingness to smile. Such attitudes are influenced heavily by culture, demographic profile, age- and sex-related factors, and even education.

Dentists often use standardized shade guides to assess tooth color, but this may not always provide satisfactory results. Spectrophotometry is a more objective and more reproducible instrument-based method of tooth color perception. The CIE Lab color space quantifies color by implementing lightness, red-green, and yellow-blue color axes. This system has been validated and aligns with the human eye's perception.

There is no demonstrated direct relationship between a more cosmetically appealing smile and quality of life. However, personality factors such as neuroticism, conscientiousness, and perfectionism may be more important in determining one's satisfaction with one's smile. In this context, the current study also considered how personality traits might alter the perceived effects of whitening, independent of the actual degree of color change achieved.

The study included 50 participants between 19 and 28 years old, randomized to either an intervention or a control group. The former received a light-activated whitening gel, while the latter received an inactive gel.

The participants were evaluated for tooth color, personality traits, and the intervention's psychosocial impacts at three time points: baseline, one week after treatment, and one year after treatment.

Both intervention and control groups were similar in age distribution, sex ratio, quality of life, spectrum of personality traits, lightness, and translucency. However, the control group had significantly lower chroma (color saturation) at baseline (p=0.001). Notably, high lightness and low chroma predict satisfaction with how one's smile looks.

The group exposed to the whitening gel showed improved tooth color one week after treatment compared to controls. The degree of whitening decreased over time, but even at one year, it was above the baseline.

Chroma decreased in the intervention group over the first week but increased one year after the intervention. The final chroma value remained lower than at baseline. Translucency went down over both the short- and long-term.

The control group showed no difference in either lightness or chroma after one week, but it decreased over one year. Translucency increased over the first week after intervention but declined over the first year thereafter. Thus, the short-term change in color was greater in the intervention group vs the control group. However, the difference between them tapered over the long term.

One week after the intervention, the whitening group significantly reduced psychological and social concerns but did not statistically significantly improve aesthetic concerns or dental self-confidence. This could reflect unrealistic expectations, the initial discomfort, or the need to get used to the change in tooth color. The intervention group did not feel that their teeth looked much better, nor did they feel more self-confident about their teeth. This might be because the difference in tooth color did not match the patient's high expectations. In comparison, controls reported a significant psychological improvement, which persisted over the long term.

At one year, the intervention group was more distressed as they perceived a relapse of their tooth discoloration, especially in participants with a detectable relapse (ΔE ≥ 3). The perceived relapse could have increased psychological stress in this group over time. In contrast, psychological improvement continued in the control group after this time.

“Preserving tooth color and addressing expectations and adaptation issues are crucial for optimizing psychological outcomes of dental aesthetic procedures.”

When stratified by personality traits, the investigators found that people who were more perfectionistic and less neurotic experienced more benefits one week after whitening. Less neurotic individuals were more satisfied with the effects of the whitening gel, in both groups.

Highly perfectionistic people were more likely to feel more socially comfortable after teeth whitening, as they are more conscious of improving their self-perceived formerly undesirable condition. Conversely, more conscientious individuals continued to experience more improvements over the long term. These effects were equally strong in both the whitening and placebo groups, indicating that personality influenced psychosocial outcomes regardless of the actual whitening achieved.

Personality traits affect psychosocial health more than the actual amount of tooth whitening achieved. People who show less responsible attitudes are more likely to act impulsively and may feel less burdened by the appearance of their smiles, thus improvements due to tooth whitening are less likely to benefit them psychosocially.

In this study, participants could not accurately assess the improvements in their tooth color after a tooth-whitening intervention. They often perceived a relapse to the discolored state over time. A strong placebo effect was seen, with participants in the control group showing satisfaction with the color change.

Personality traits played a powerful role in the procedure's impact on patients' psychosocial outcomes. Inter-group differences in psychosocial scores were not statistically significant overall, likely due to the high variability in individual responses. This indicates the need to adopt a personalized approach to cosmetic dental treatments, including individualized counseling, to ensure patient expectations are realistic and that patients are satisfied with the treatment provided.

The authors also noted study limitations, including the small sample size, focus on a single tooth, potential dehydration effects on enamel leading to temporary lightness changes, and technical challenges in repeat color measurements.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New research highlights combined impact of genes and lifestyle on dilated cardiomyopathy","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250812/New-research-highlights-combined-impact-of-genes-and-lifestyle-on-dilated-cardiomyopathy.aspx","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 04:07:00 GMT","

An international team, led by scientists from the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute has studied around 3000 people affected by the heart disease dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) – a driver of heart failure and sudden cardiac arrest.

They discovered those who had a mutation in a particular gene called TTN were 21 times more likely to develop the disease than family members who did not carry a mutation.

For the first time, the team found that a person's general health and lifestyle factors; such as being overweight or having high alcohol consumption, contributed to an earlier DCM diagnosis.

The study published in the European Heart Journal involving 1000 families affected by DCM also found men with the mutation were more likely to develop DCM at a younger age than women.

Our study reveals just how much mutations in this gene raise the risk of developing DCM. That's a good thing for patients because it means doctors can keep a far closer eye on them, and ensure they have early access to medical treatments.

We have also crucially shown is that it's not all down to your genes. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and being on the right medications could help prevent or delay dilated cardiomyopathy for decades. We hope it will incentivise those at risk to exercise, eat well and drink less and better manage other risk factors too.""

Professor Fatkin, head of the Inherited Heart Diseases Laboratory, Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute

DCM affects approximately one in 250 people worldwide – that's around 32 million individuals.

Truncating mutations in the TTN gene are the most common genetic cause of DCM and can be tested for through a simple blood test but until now it was not known how much these mutations raised the risk of developing the disease, or how other risk factors, both clinical and lifestyle, contributed to the onset of the disease.

Clinical factors such as having high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes also increased the risk, whilst having a history of atrial fibrillation doubled the chance of getting DCM.

The findings highlight the need for more research and clinical trials to determine if people with TTN mutations would benefit from being given DCM medications before symptoms begin.

""There are still so many questions to be solved – for example should we be giving drug therapies to those at risk far earlier? Could that delay or prevent DCM from developing entirely, and if so when exactly should that therapy start?"" adds Professor Fatkin.

The researchers recruited 3158 patients from 1043 families affected by TTN mutations. It was the largest study of its kind ever done and involved patients from Australia, North America, the UK, Europe and South Korea. Family members were assessed clinically and underwent genetic testing to see if they carried a TTN mutation.

The researchers first examined the link between the age of diagnosis and the type of mutation and then investigated the relationship between age at DCM diagnosis and cardiac risk factors (such as high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, obesity, diabetes, thyroid disease), and lifestyle factors (including alcohol intake and exercise patterns).

Scientists at Tsinghua University have developed a method to grow kidney tumors in the lab using cells from real patients, offering a potential new tool in the fight against renal cancer. Their research, published in the journal Biofabrication, outlines how 3D bioprinting technology can be used to replicate the unique characteristics of each patient's tumor.

The team combined tumor cells with other cell types, including blood vessel-like structures, to mimic the environment within the body. The lab-grown tumors, called organoids, are created from real patients' tumor cells, and exactly mimic their traits. This realistic model provides a more accurate platform for studying tumor development and testing how different therapies perform. The technology also reduces the need for labour-intensive manual processes, enabling faster and more scalable testing.

The incidence rate of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is increasing annually, posing a serious threat to human health. One of the main challenges in treatment is that many patients don't respond well to chemotherapy, and targeted drugs work differently for each person. tumors vary significantly, and genetic changes over time can lead to treatment failure, drug resistance, and higher chances of recurrence. Current lab models are often inconsistent and don't accurately reflect how tumors behave in the body, making it difficult to test realistic treatment options.

The new 3D bioprinting approach overcomes these limitations by producing organoids that retain the same features as the original tumors. This allows researchers to test multiple therapies quickly and identify the most effective options before applying them in the clinic.

This new method could greatly improve how we study kidney cancer and develop personalized treatments for patients. The rapid production of organoids will make it much faster to find the right treatment for individual patients.""

New research reveals the exact protein blends and doses that help plant-based athletes recover like those using whey, but warns that some plant proteins still fall short.

Study: Effect of Plant-Based Proteins on Recovery from Resistance Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage in Healthy Young Adults—A Systematic Review. Image credit: Josep Suria/Shutterstok.com

Scientists have systematically reviewed the available literature to assess the effectiveness of plant-based proteins in recovering muscle damage induced by resistance exercise in healthy young adults. This review is published in Nutrients. 

Protein intake is essential among athletes because it facilitates muscle repair and stimulates recovery. Animal proteins (e.g., whey), rich in essential amino acids, particularly leucine, have gained popularity for their role in inducing muscle protein synthesis (MPS).

Previous studies have documented the potential health benefits of plant-based proteins in reducing the risk of cardiometabolic diseases and promoting blood glucose regulation. Considering its benefits, scientists have focused on exploring its potential in improving athletic performance and recovery.

Recently, scientists have documented a rapid shift towards plant-based eating in the athletic dietary landscape, due to various environmental, ethical, and health-related considerations. In addition, athletes who follow a vegan diet consciously avoid all animal products and solely rely on plant-based protein sources.

Since plants offer a different amino acid profile than animals, it is essential to understand whether plant-based proteins offer similar support in repairing muscle damage incurred from resistance training. Previous studies have shown that more plant-based protein consumption can fulfill the leucine and total protein requirements.

Many athletes perform resistance exercises for general fitness, which can induce muscle damage, primarily from eccentric contractions. These exercises promote delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), making them an ideal model to study muscle damage from eccentric and non-eccentric resistance exercise contexts and their recovery. Although plant-based diets have gained significant popularity worldwide, limited studies examine their effects specifically in vegan athletes, and evidence is scarce.

The current review evaluated the existing evidence on the effect of plant-based proteins in muscle recovery after resistance training. The study included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized trials, and crossover studies published in English. All relevant studies were obtained from electronic databases, such as Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ProQuest, Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, and Embase. Although vegan athletes were part of the eligibility criteria, only one study exclusively investigated the group.

Healthy young adults between 18 and 44, including vegan athletes, who engaged in resistance training, were included. All participants consume plant-based proteins (e.g., rice, soy, pea, cocoa, hemp, or blends), as acute or chronic supplements in quantified doses. These supplements were consumed before, during, or after resistance training. The efficacy of plant-based proteins was evaluated by comparing the outcomes with animal-based proteins (e.g., whey, casein), placebo/sham interventions, or no supplementation. The primary outcomes include muscle recovery indicators such as MPS, DOMS, inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., CK, IL-6), and fatigue. Secondary outcomes included muscle function and body composition.

A total of 24 studies fulfilled all eligibility criteria and were considered. These studies were conducted between 2002 and 2024, with most conducted in 2024, indicating a recent growing interest in plant-based protein for recovery after resistance training. Approximately 92% of these studies were RCTs, followed by non-randomized designs. Nearly all studies were conducted in Western countries, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Europe, and the United States, except one conducted in India.

The selected studies include data from 938 participants. The authors highlighted limited research on plant-based proteins in vegan athletes and sedentary or inactive individuals. Most studies have investigated the efficacy of plant-based proteins, particularly soy protein, across mixed-gender cohorts. However, some studies have also evaluated the efficacy of plant-based protein extracted from pea, potato, bean, rice, cocoa, hemp, or protein blends on muscle recovery post resistance training. Protein doses ranged from 15 to 40 g/day, frequently administered post-exercise. Evidence suggests that doses ≥30 g containing 2.5 – 3 g leucine are more likely to produce effects comparable to whey.

Most research measured muscle recovery indirectly or subjectively (e.g., soreness and fatigue), while few assessed objectively based on post-exercise MPS, biomarkers, skeletal muscle satellite number, phenylalanine balance, muscle thickness, amino acid transport rates, and transporter expression.

Nine studies indicated positive effects of plant-based proteins on muscle recovery outcomes. Most positive effects were associated with blended plant protein formulations or higher doses (≥30 g with ~2.5 g leucine). Researchers also observed that single-source plant proteins, such as soy, potato, pea, and cocoa, did not positively impact hormonal balance, MPS, and biochemical indices in most trials. However, some individual studies reported comparable outcomes to whey for specific measures such as lean mass or strength gains.

Although plant-based proteins improved body mass index and muscle strength, findings on lean mass gains were inconsistent across studies. Some evidence also suggested that gender-specific responses, such as greater hypertrophy in women and fatigue resistance in men with hemp protein, but these effects require confirmation. Multiple studies have shown that trained athletes consuming 50 g of soy protein per day experienced a reduction in muscle damage biomarkers and improved subjective recovery, supporting a potential dose-dependent effect.

Many of the positive MPS findings came from acute studies, and the review noted that these short-term changes may not always translate into long-term performance or body composition improvements. The review found substantial variability in protocols, protein formulations, and outcome measures and a moderate-to-high risk of bias in many studies. Detection bias was common in trials relying on self-reported soreness or fatigue, and a meta-analysis was not conducted because of heterogeneity.

The current study underscored the prospect of replacing animal proteins with plant-based protein blends to support muscle recovery in young athletes post-resistance exercise. However, the authors caution that the evidence base is limited, particularly for vegan-specific populations, and that findings are more consistent for acute MPS stimulation than long-term functional outcomes such as strength or lean mass.

To obtain optimal results, vegan athletes must use protein blends in higher doses to meet recovery needs. Future high-quality, longer-term trials with standardized protocols are needed to establish definitive recommendations.

Oxytocin promotes social behaviors and helps maintain relationships. But clinical trials in patients with autism show variability in how consistently oxytocin improves these behaviors. Steve Chang, from Yale University, led a study to explore how oxytocin influences brain activity to shape social behavior in rhesus monkeys and why its effects are so variable. This work is featured in JNeurosci's Central Questions for Social Neuroscience Research Special Collection. 

The researchers focused on the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) because these brain areas process reward and integrate information during social decision-making. Delivering oxytocin directly into the BLA had state-dependent effects; when monkeys were socially motivated prior to oxytocin exposure, the hormone maintained socially beneficial decisions and social task behavior over a longer time period, but oxytocin didn't influence the same monkeys when they were less motivated. Brain activity supported these results showing that oxytocin increased BLA and ACC activity only when monkeys were socially motivated. Activity in the BLA and ACC was also more coordinated during prolonged social states, suggesting that oxytocin may stabilize communication in this pathway to sustain social behavior. 

Says Chang, ""We previously found that communication between these brain areas is important for social reward and behavior. So, the link between enhancement of this signal and prolonged social behavior was interesting to see."" Elaborating on clinical implications, Chang adds, ""We have to be more careful and not just use a standardized approach. Even within individuals, there are variations in the effectiveness of oxytocin treatment! It may be important to individually tailor treatments.""

""Pharmacotherapy can help people living with obesity improve overall health, not just lose weight,"" says Dr. Sue D. Pedersen, MD, endocrinologist and obesity medicine specialist in Calgary, and lead author of this guideline. ""The goal of obesity medications is to improve metabolic, mechanical, and/or mental health, and improve quality of life, incorporating treatment goals that are important to each individual patient.""

The guideline includes 6 new and 7 revised recommendations, reflecting the latest evidence since the 2022 and 2020 versions of the guideline. It takes the emphasis off body mass index (BMI) and focuses on an individualized approach that uses additional indicators, such as waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, adjusted for sex and ethnicity where appropriate, and the presence of obesity-related complications.

Obesity pharmacotherapy is a safe and effective option to support long-term obesity care. It is one of three pillars of treatment outlined in the full Canadian Adult Obesity Clinical Practice Guideline, with other pillars being behavioural and psychological and surgical approaches. Obesity treatment should always be tailored to each person's specific health needs, values, and preferences. Recommendations also support sustained use of obesity pharmacotherapy as part of a long-term strategy to maintain improvements in health and quality of life.""

Dr. Sue D. Pedersen, MD, endocrinologist and obesity medicine specialist in Calgary

Recommendations include two new medications, tirzepatide and setmelanotide, as well as new recommendations for obesity-related complications such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, osteoarthritis, and more.

The guideline recommends against using compounded obesity medications because of concerns about content, safety, efficacy, and quality.

The guideline panel notes that only Alberta recognizes obesity as a chronic disease. Barriers to access - such as cost, stigma, and limited drug plan coverage - continue to prevent Canadians from receiving medication and support.

""The lack of recognition of obesity as a chronic disease by public and private payers, health systems, the public, and media has a trickle-down effect, limiting access to treatment (e.g., related to medication costs),"" the authors conclude.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study identifies risk factors that increase risk of death in children with Fontan circulatory failure","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250811/Study-identifies-risk-factors-that-increase-risk-of-death-in-children-with-Fontan-circulatory-failure.aspx","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 03:55:00 GMT","

A multi-center study has identified critical risk factors that increase the likelihood of death in children with a heart defect who are awaiting or have recently undergone heart transplantation, according to findings published in Circulation.

Fontan circulatory failure (FCF) is a long-term complication in children born with single-ventricle heart defects who have undergone a series of surgeries that culminates with the Fontan procedure. While this surgery helps reroute blood flow and extend life expectancy, it can lead to chronic health problems, including heart failure and damage to other organs. Many of these patients eventually require a heart transplant.

The new study, conducted across 20 U.S. medical centers, offers new insights into how specific health complications affect survival in children with the condition, said co-author Anna Joong, MD, cardiologist at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

""We have a strong interest in understanding patients with Fontan circulatory failure: how we can better manage their heart failure, when the ideal time is to list them for a heart transplant, and what the risk factors are while waiting for a transplant,"" Dr. Joong said.

In the study, investigators analyzed data from 409 patients who had undergone a Fontan procedure and were listed for heart transplant between 2008 and 2022. They tracked outcomes from the time of waitlisting through one year after transplant. They found that 5.9 percent died awaiting a transplant, and among those transplanted, 8.5 percent died within the first year.

The investigators also found that certain pre-existing conditions significantly increased the risk of death, including:

Overall, survival has improved for patients who have single ventricle physiology and who had a Fontan. A really novel finding of this study was that patients with low oxygen levels were associated with poor outcomes. That's an important thing for clinicians and families to know about, as an additional risk factor and when to refer to advanced heart failure therapies.""

Dr. Anna Joong, MD, cardiologist at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine

The findings should guide clinicians in identifying high-risk patients earlier and considering more aggressive interventions, including earlier heart failure team and transplant referral, Dr. Joong said. Overall, the study lays the groundwork for improving transplant outcomes and tailoring care to the specific needs of children born with single-ventricle heart defects.

Moving forward, Joong and her collaborators will continue to study children post-heart transplant to understand their quality of life and address any functional limitations, she said.

The study was supported by a grant from the Additional Ventures and Enduring Hearts organizations and a gift from the Van Hooser family.

Research from the Nanoscience Center of the University of Jyväskylä, Finland, has revealed that lignin, a polyphenol, important for plant structure, has antimicrobial activity against viruses and bacteria. The results highlight that lignin, which is also an important by-product from wood industry, has potential as promising green alternative to synthetic antimicrobial agents for coating agents, packaging material, or surface disinfectants. The research is fruitful collaboration with Spinnova Oy and CH Bioforce. 

The University of Jyväskylä study used a simple water-based extraction method, in which lignin was isolated in high purity from birch chips, wheat straw and oat husks. The method allows the products to maintain a high total phenol content and effectively remove carbohydrate impurities.

- We revealed that these aqueous-based lignin samples demonstrated strong antiviral efficacy against non-enveloped enteroviruses but also good activity against enveloped coronaviruses and tested bacteria, rejoices Professor of Cell and Molecular Biology Varpu Marjomäki from the University of Jyväskylä.

In addition to testing human seasonal coronavirus (HCoV-OC43) in Biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) laboratory, the research team evaluated the efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in a BSL-3 laboratory in Jyväskylä.

- The results revealed that lignins exhibited much stronger antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19, in comparison to the HCoV-OC43 causing common cold. Furthermore, the lignins had inhibitory effects on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, explains Doctoral Researcher Jun Liu from the University of Jyväskylä.

By employing a range of classical and in-house-developed biochemical and imaging techniques, the research team was able to investigate the underlying antimicrobial mechanisms.

- The results revealed that lignins inactivate enteroviruses by stabilizing and aggregating viral particles, thereby reducing their entry into the host cells and by preventing the release of the infective RNA genome in the cells, says Marjomäki.

In contrast, transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy revealed that lignin solutions disrupted the structural integrity of coronavirus particles, hence reducing their ability to bind to and infect host cells. Electron microscopy also revealed clear effects on bacterial cell membrane and aggregation of bacterial internal materials. Professor of Cell and Molecular Biology Lotta-Riina Sundberg says this suggests that active chemical groups penetrate the cells, ultimately leading to bacterial dysfunction.

- Research shows that lignin can be an environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic microbe-repellent substances. It can be used in coatings, packaging, and disinfectant products in a safer and more sustainable way, specifies Sundberg.

The work was done under tight collaboration between University of Jyväskylä, Spinnova Oy and CH Bioforce.

In this interview, News Medical‑Life Sciences speaks with  Dr. Todd Bauman, Senior Director of Supply Chain, and Chris Povich, Vice President of Automation, at Ascential Medical & Life Sciences about right shoring in life sciences and how medical manufacturers are aligning supply chain strategy with cost, risk, and resilience in today's complex global environment.

Todd Bauman: I'm Dr. Todd Bauman, Senior Director of Supply Chain at Ascential, where I lead strategy focused on cost control, operational risk reduction, and long‑term value across our global medical and life sciences manufacturing network.

Chris Povich: I'm Chris Povich, Vice President of Automation. My role is to support our customers in automating production systems, helping them mitigate risk and scale efficiently across regions while maintaining compliance and quality in medical manufacturing.

Todd: Right shoring is not just a choice between offshoring and reshoring. It's about aligning your supply chain footprint with your business goals, customer needs, and external pressures such as tariffs or labor shortages. It takes into account the total cost, risk exposure, and resilience over time.

Todd: Cost miscalculations, geopolitical instability, long lead times, and inventory shocks—like we saw during COVID—are major drivers. Ethical sourcing concerns and public perception also play a role. Supply chains optimized purely for labor cost are increasingly exposed.

Chris: Automation is essential, especially when reshoring to higher labor-cost regions. By investing in automation, companies can reduce labor dependence, increase throughput, and improve quality. It also helps speed up workforce training and enables faster scaling of duplicate lines across geographies.

Todd: We've implemented a regional supply model—leveraging Central American suppliers for Costa Rica, European suppliers for Ireland, and Asian suppliers for Singapore and Malaysia. This reduces logistics risk, regulatory hurdles, and increases resilience by localizing supply where we manufacture.

Chris: The two options—line transfer or duplication—come with complexity. Duplicating a line requires reevaluation of obsolete components and sourcing constraints. Labor cost and skill shortages may make full transfers costly, so automation often becomes a necessary investment. Timeline, compliance, and capital cost are all key factors.

Todd: Landed cost looks at transport and tariffs, but TCO includes overhead, warranty costs, inspection, and reverse logistics. TCO offers a more holistic view, and when tariffs rise—as they have for aluminum from China—it often tips the scales toward reshoring or regionalizing.

Chris: Look for a global partner with mature local capabilities. They should offer deep engineering breadth, regulatory knowledge, and regional service support. This reduces costs, travel burdens, and improves time to market. At Ascential, our footprint and flexibility allow for scalable, localized execution across the globe.

Todd: Don't follow the bandwagon—use your math. Every company's optimal model is different. Map your risks, evaluate your costs holistically, and align your sourcing strategy with long-term corporate goals. Regionalization isn't just a trend—it's a smart path forward.

Chris Povich is Vice President of Automation at Ascential Medical & Life Sciences. He brings extensive experience in automation strategy, system integration, and operational scale-up for the life sciences sector. Chris specializes in global project execution, line duplication, and technology integration to enhance manufacturing efficiency and resilience.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Research finds long-term health challenges in survivors of childhood cancer","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250811/Research-finds-long-term-health-challenges-in-survivors-of-childhood-cancer.aspx","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 03:10:00 GMT","

Researchers at City of Hope®, one of the largest and most advanced cancer research and treatment organizations in the United States with its National Medical Center ranked among the nation's top cancer centers by U.S. News & World Report, today published a new study which found that some survivors of childhood cancer are more at risk for serious health issues as they grow older, including new cancers and chronic conditions like heart disease. 

While a cause for concern, the findings published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology also point to a silver lining: The ailments are potentially manageable if caught early and treated.

Our study underscores the importance of partnership among patients, their primary care providers and cancer survivorship programs to ensure survivors receive necessary screening for the early detection, prevention and treatment of conditions, including secondary cancers, resulting from lifesaving treatment. We at City of Hope are continuing to learn more about what health conditions survivors of childhood cancer are at risk for at different times in their life to inform the updating of evidence-based guidelines for cancer survivors.""

Rusha Bhandari, M.D., pediatric hematologist-oncologist at City of Hope and corresponding author of the new study

The City of Hope-led study is the first to look at childhood cancer survivors who reached the age of 50, a population that is expected to grow as cancer treatments continue to improve and become more targeted and personalized. 

Nearly 15,000 children and adolescents in the United States are diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma or other types of cancer each year. The rate of young patients surviving cancer for at least five years is now 85%, up from 58% a few decades ago. 

To determine long-term risks, Dr. Bhandari, Saro Armenian, D.O., M.P.H., a pediatric hematologist-oncologist at City of Hope Children's Cancer Center, and their colleagues reviewed a national database that tracks about 40,000 people who were diagnosed with cancer before they turned 21. The researchers identified individuals who were still alive at age 50 and then compared any new incidence of cancer with the rate of cancer found in the general population. The risks for chronic health conditions were compared to the patients' siblings. 

Having overcome cancer at an early age, survivors face new risks when they turn older, the study found. Young patients have a higher risk of secondary cancers and are five times more likely to die from the disease compared to other individuals over the age of 50.

Cancer survivors face increased risks for heart disease as well. In fact, pediatric cancer survivors had a higher incidence of heart problems at age 55 compared to their 70-year-old siblings. They were also more frail, had trouble with physical exertion and suffered poorer health in general. 

Looking at the type of cancer treatment survivors had received, the team found that radiation therapy was the main culprit for future risks, rather than chemotherapy. 

""Radiation causes cellular DNA damage that can lead to mutations and the development of new cancers,"" said Dr. Armenian, senior author of the study. 

The study was based on treatment regimens used in the 1970s and 80s. There have been vast improvements since then, including delaying or avoiding radiation in favor of targeted cancer drugs and emerging treatments such as immunotherapy and precision oncology. Still, Dr. Bhandari urges greater vigilance to protect against future health problems. 

""Some survivors should screen for conditions like breast or colon cancer at an earlier age than is recommended for the general population,"" Dr. Armenian said. ""Teamwork is needed to ensure survivors receive necessary screening and preventative care for conditions, including secondary cancers.""

While young cancer patients faced more health problems as they got older, the study did find a bright spot when it came to mental health. Cancer survivors were no more likely to report mental health issues than their siblings at age 50. 

""This mental health finding may reflect the resilience and positive mindset of our long-term survivors who have battled cancer,"" Dr. Bhandari said. ""This is a wonderful example of how our patients continue to inspire us as they navigate their cancer and survivorship journeys.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Chelsea hoping to keep key goalie target away from Manchester United","https://fansided.com/soccer/chelsea-keep-key-goalie-target-away-from-manchester-united","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 14:02:23 GMT","

Despite playing a key role in Chelsea's Club World Cup win this summer, Robert Sánchez is still deemed the weak link in the Blues' roster. The goalkeeper made many mistakes last season, and Chelsea winning the Club World Cup has given Enzo Maresca the funds to sign a new keeper. 

Chelsea will face competition from Manchester United if they are to sign a world-class player in that position. RMC Sport has reported (translated from French) ""Gianluigi Donnarumma is not among the PSG players selected to play in the European Super Cup against Tottenham this Wednesday

""The Italian goalkeeper is being urged to find a new club, following the arrival of Lucas Chevalier from Lille... Chelsea and Manchester United have inquired about the goalkeeper's situation in recent hours."" 

Donnarumma played a key role in PSG's Champions League win last season and is regarded as one of the best keepers in the world. However, his contract expires next summer, and the French side has already signed a replacement for him. 

The highly rated 23-year-old, Lucas Chevalier, was signed from LOSC Lille for $47 million this summer. This has made Donnarumma surplus to requirements. However, the Italian international could now get his chance in the Premier League. 

Chelsea is in the Champions League after finishing fourth in the Premier League last season. As Donnarumma won European soccer's top competition last year, he will feel he belongs in the tournament. 

United, on the other hand, finished a lowly 15th in English soccer's top flight last season. They had a chance to qualify for the Champions League via the Europa League. However, they lost in the final of that competition to Tottenham Hotspur. 

Both Chelsea and the Red Devils could do with a new keeper. Sánchez and United's André Onana are not regarded as the best goalies in the world. Onana is also injured, which means that Altay Bayındır will likely start the season as United's first choice. 

United is a historic club, as is Chelsea in the modern era. The lure of Old Trafford is still great, but the Blues are a team that appears to be on the up right now. Therefore, Donnarumma should hold out for a move to Stamford Bridge.

Gambling group delivers better-than-expected half-year results, helping it to brace for looming tax rises

Business live – latest updates

A flurry of bets on the football Club World Cup, England's triumphant European Women's Championship campaign and summer tennis tournaments helped the UK gambling company Entain to better-than-expected results, helping it brace for looming tax rises in its domestic market.

The owner of brands including Ladbrokes and Coral reported an 11% rise in underlying profits to £583m in the first half of the year, on revenues that rose 3% to nearly £2.6bn.

At BetMGM, Entain's 50%-owned US joint-venture, revenues rose by more than a third. US sports betting continues to grow rapidly following the supreme court's overturning in 2018 of a decades-old ban on the practice.

But Entain also performed strongly in its home market, with online gambling revenues up 21% in the UK and Ireland.

Entain said the Club World Cup, held in the US earlier this summer, had delivered “fantastic results” for the company, despite a muted response to the tournament in the UK.

Entain describes Brazil as one of its “must win” markets, alongside the UK and US, and it has a partnership with the São Paulo team – and Club World Cup participant – Palmeiras. The company said this helped boost local interest in betting on the tournament.

The Club World Cup final, between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, was the year's most popular event by the number of bets taken. The French Open and Wimbledon tennis tournaments also delivered new records for the company, amid surging interest from gamblers in a sport whose design inherently creates opportunities to place rapid-fire wagers.

Female tennis players have spoken out this year about the abuse they receive, often from gamblers frustrated by having lost bets.

Entain's chief executive, Stella David, appointed earlier this year after her predecessor, Gavin Isaacs, departed suddenly after five months, said the results showed the company was “getting stronger, fitter and faster”.

Entain's improved fortunes in the UK could cushion the blow if the Treasury goes ahead with plans to target the gambling industry with higher taxes, as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, casts around for ways to plug a fiscal hole.

Gordon Brown, a former prime minister who also served a decade as chancellor, called recently for gambling duties to increase by £3bn, from about £2.5bn at present, to pay for lifting the two-child limit on benefits.

The Treasury is expected to increase taxes levied on the sector, albeit by a smaller amount than Brown has suggested.

Speaking to analysts about tax, David said: “People should look at the maths and be very careful about where we go forward. There is already a large black market in the UK and driving up tax rates has the potential of reducing the tax take because people go to the black market.”

Industry lobbyists have argued that increased taxes would force bookmakers to pass on the cost in the form of worse odds available to gamblers, which would drive them to illegal operators.

While Entain reported rising underlying profit, it lost £96m before tax overall, due to the impact of one-off costs including amortisation of acquisitions and the cost of legal issues.

These include alleged non-compliance with money-laundering laws in Australia and a deferred prosecution agreement relating to bribery charges involving a business it owned in Turkey.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Luis Enrique has not been given a touchline ban for the UEFA Super Cup, despite his apparent 'slap' on Joao Pedro at the Club World Cup. 

FIFA launched an investigation into the shocking incident at the end of the bad-tempered final between PSG and Chelsea last month. 

And despite Enrique appearing to connect with the Brazilian's face, before the striker went down to the turf, he has escaped punishment. 

That means he'll be in situ in his technical area as usual when the Champions League winners face Europa League champions Spurs on Wednesday night in Italy. 

Enrique's 'slap' was another major flashpoint of the game in which Joao Neves was sent off for pulling the hair of Marc Cucurella.

After the final whistle, players and coaches from both sides came together in an altercation, with Enrique also involved.

During the melee, Enrique appeared to use his hand to make contact with Pedro in what some have termed a slap. 

Pedro hit the turf in a heap, with PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma in close proximity. 

Enrique subsequently tried to explain his actions, claiming he was attempting to act as a peacekeeper.    

'At the end of the match, there is a lot of tension. It is a situation that can be avoided by everyone,' said the PSG boss.

'I think that is logical. I am going to prevent my players from going any further in that brawl and from then on there is pushing and shoving from everyone. 

'I think that is not the best thing to do. 

'It's a result of the tension, the result of the situation of the match and I have nothing more to add. 

When asked about the incident with Enrique after full-time, Pedro said: 'We're world champions and that's what matters.

'At the end of the day, it's normal. Both teams wanted to win and that happens. It's all part of it.'

How do we fill the days until the 2026 World Cup? By keeping up with some of the world's top sides in what will be an action-packed European club season. 

Three of the continent's Big Five circuits – England's Premier League, Spain's La Liga and Ligue 1 in France – kick off this weekend, with Germany's Bundesliga and Italy's Serie A following on Aug. 22 and 23, respectively. In other countries, domestic league action is already underway. 

But these are the 20 clubs to watch, loaded with the stars we'll be seeing next summer. Ahead of the top European campaigns kicking off, let's count down the teams who'll shine the brightest.

Note: League positions reflect last season's finish.

So what if the defending European champions lost decisively to Chelsea in last month's FIFA Club World Cup final? Luis Enrique's PSG is still the team to beat in 2025-26. Luis Enrique returns close to his entire squad from last season's long-awaited triumph, though keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma could leave this month. If he does, the Parisians already have Donnarumma's replacement in French international Lucas Chevalier, who arrived from Lille for $47 million.   

Last year, the Reds ran away with the Premier League title, besting second-place Arsenal by 10 points. Despite the tragic death of forward Diogo Jota, Liverpool has only gotten better this summer. Arne Slot's side has been the big winner of this transfer window, dropping north of $350 million on backup keeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, defenders Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, and forwards Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz. No wonder they're the favorites to retain the English title.

Baca was just seconds away from reaching the UEFA Champions League final last season under first-year manager Hansi Flick. This season, the Blaugrana are looking to go at least one step further. Who says they can't? Eighteen-year-old Lamine Yamal is on his way to becoming the world's best player — if he isn't already. Fellow Ballon d'Or candidate Raphinha had 34 goals in all competitions in 2024-25, doubling his previous career-best. Robert Lewandowski, who turns 37 on Aug. 21, remains an elite striker. Pedri runs the show behind them. The rest of the regulars return, too, with forward Marcus Rashford the marquee summer addition. 

After finishing fourth in the Prem last term, the Blues stunned many by winning the expanded, 32-team Club World Cup in July. Can they harness that momentum and use it to challenge for English and European titles next spring? They've got the firepower. Chelsea already have an emerging superstar in winger Cole Palmer — this season he'll be supported by new recruits like strikers Liam Delap and João Pedro, Pedro's fellow Brazilian attacker Estêvão, and English forward Jamie Gittens.

The Premier League runner-up in each of the last three seasons, what Mikel Arteta's team is missing at this point are trophies. Still, Arsenal continues to improve. The Gunners knocked then-Champions League holders Real Madrid out of Europe's top club tournament last April, snaring a convincing 5-1 aggregate win. And they've added real quality this summer in the form of defensive midfielder Martín Zubimendi and forwards Viktor Gyökeres and Noni Madueke. 

The record 15-time European champs are coming off what, by their standards, was a dreadful 2024-25, with no major titles secured. But Los Blancos still boast one of the deepest, most expensive squads on Planet Fútbol. And Kylian Mbappé & Co. are now led by one of the sport's great up-and-coming coaches in former Real Madrid captain Xabi Alonso, who replaced the legendary Carlo Ancelotti in June. 

City's unprecedented run of four consecutive Premier League titles came to a halt last season, when Pep Guardiola's side finished third, lost the FA Cup final to Crystal Palace, and were eliminated from European play before the Champions League's round of 16 even began. This team is too good not to bounce back in a big way this year, though — even without club legend Kevin de Bruyne, whose contract wasn't extended. 

Having reached the UEFA Champions League final in two of the last three seasons, nobody should underestimate the Nerazzurri. Inter added Croatian midfielder Petar Sučić, Brazilian winger Luis Henrique and French striker Ange-Yoan Bonny this summer. Besides veteran forward Joaquín Correa, their most significant departure is manager Simone Inzaghi, who was replaced by former Inter defender Cristian Chivu in June. 

After losing the German title to Bayer Leverkusen in 2023-24, Bayern reclaimed its status as the Bundesliga's standard-bearer last season, finishing as champs for the 12th time in 13 seasons.  Things will be different this year without club legend (and new Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder) Thomas Müller, with Leroy Sané leaving, too. But the $81 million arrival of Colombian winger Luis Díaz from Liverpool will help.

Can Atleti end their four-year title drought and beat Barcelona and Real Madrid to La Liga glory this season? Occasionally, Madrid's other team outlasts Spain's double-headed monster. Longtime manager Diego Simeone will be hoping his team is due after a strong summer transfer window which saw $185 million-worth of new talent arrive — including former Villarreal attacker Álex Baena, USMNT midfielder Johnny Cardoso and Argentine World Cup-winner (and Atlanta United alum) Thiago Almada. 

Scudetto winners in 2023 and 2025, the Neapolitans are no doubt aiming for similar success in European play this season to celebrate the club's centennial. The arrival of Champions League winner Kevin de Bruyne on a free transfer from Manchester City can't hurt. Neither will forward Noa Lang, who helped PSV reach the knockout stage in each of the last two years. 

The Magpies eked into the Champions League places last term only because UEFA granted England's top flight one additional spot. Newcastle fans aren't complaining though, though they will be if and when star forward Alexander Isak leaves for Liverpool on the eve of the new season. 

Juve got the proven, consistent goalscorer they've long needed when the ""Old Lady"" inked Canadian striker Jonathan David on a free transfer from Lille following the Concacaf Gold Cup. David replaces Randal Kolo Muani, who returned to PSG upon the completion of his loan, in manager Igor Tudor's lineup.

The club that helped develop the all-world likes of Jude Bellingham and Erling Haaland in recent years has a new batch coming through — one led by midfielder Jobe Bellingham, Jude's younger brother. But most of the vets that took the Black & Yellow to the 2024 Champions League final remain, not least captain Emre Can, playmaker Julian Brandt and Swiss keeper Gregor Kobel. 

It's hard to believe that the 20-time English champions finished 15th last season, when they also lost the Europa League final to Premier League rivals Tottenham. But the Red Devils added forwards Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Šeško this window, and they should fare better in Ruben Amorim's first full season at the Old Trafford helm. 

Plenty of big names — think Mbappé, Thierry Henry and George Weah — have come through the Principality over the years. AS Monaco added a few more this summer in former France World Cup winner Paul Pogba and Barcelona loanee Ansu Fati. Both should help in the Champions League, with Les Rouge et Blancs looking to reach the round of 16 for the first time since 2017. 

The loss of star attractions Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong (both to Liverpool) and manager Xabi Alonso (to Real Madrid) hurts. Same for Odilon Kossounou and Granit Xhaka, who also left this summer. But stout defender Jarell Quansah, fellow $40 million man (and USMNT star) Malik Tillman, and new boss Eric ten Hag should help keep the club near the top of the Bundesliga. 

As Dutch champs the last two years, PSV has also pushed above its weight in the Champions League, reaching the knockout stages twice and knocking out Italian titans Juventus last season. They lost Tillman, Lang and others this summer, but having USMNT pair Sergiño Dest and Ricardo Pepi back healthy this season could be a coup for coach Peter Bosz.

The Champions League-bound Turkish giants made waves this summer by signing prolific 26-year-old Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen from Napoli for $87 million on a permanent deal, as well as bringing in German winger Leroy Sané for free from Bayern Munich. 

The Ligue 1 runner-up to PSG last year and three times overall this decade, Marseille is chasing its first domestic title since 2010. The ambition is there, with L'OM dropping almost $90 million on transfers this summer. Yet two potentially huge contributors came for free: former Arsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and USMNT veteran Tim Weah, who previously won a French title with Lille in 2020-21.

Moises Caicedo is heading into the 2025/26 season full of belief that Chelsea can make a strong impact in the Premier League. 

He's also excited about stepping onto the Champions League stage for the first time. The Ecuadorian midfielder is coming off a dream campaign.

Voted both Chelsea's Player of the Year and Players' Player of the Year, Caicedo capped his season by helping the Blues lift two trophies.

He scored in the 4-1 demolition of Real Betis in the Europa Conference League final, and his performance at the Club World Cup saw him named the third-best player in the tournament.

Caicedo returned home to Ecuador over the summer and was greeted like a national hero.

“People stopped me in the street,” Caicedo told Chelsea's website. “It was crazy, they were happy to see me, I could see on their faces.

“It was incredible seeing my country and how happy people were watching me win the Club World Cup. My family also are proud of me, and I enjoyed being there a lot.”

Now back at Cobham, Caicedo has shifted his focus to the 2025/26 season. Manager Enzo Maresca has praised him as an important part of the team, and he is using that praise as fuel.

“I appreciate that and it's a motivation for me,” he said. “It's why I train every day even harder.”

Caicedo knows that the coming Premier League season will be as demanding as ever, but he is confident that Chelsea can make their mark.

“I just want to start the season really well,” he said. “For sure, it will be an incredible and tough season also, because we know the Premier League is always tough, but we are going to do well.”

The 23-year-old is also looking forward to playing in the Champions League for the first time in his career after helping the Blues qualify for the first time since 2022/23.

“It's a dream come true and I am looking forward to it,” he said. “It's another level, and now we are there, we want to do really well.”

Chelsea have been busy in the transfer market, but they're still negotiating deals for Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho and RB Leipzig forward Xavi Simons.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Coral and Ladbrokes owner Entain has revealed a surge in online gaming as popular sporting events such as Wimbledon and the men's football Club World Cup reeled in punters.

The sports betting giant reported total net gaming revenues – the amount of money the company pockets after paying out winnings to customers – of £2.6 billion for the first six months of the year, excluding its operations in the US.

This was 6% higher than the same period a year ago, at constant currency rates.

The increase jumped to 8% in the UK and Ireland, the company's biggest market, while online sales in the region surged by a fifth year-on-year.

Both the volume of players and the value of sales increased, which Entain said reflected an improved experience for customers as well as previous changes to gambling rules starting to level out.

The company had previously warned about the impact from regulatory changes in the UK which were designed to make betting safer for consumers.

The FIFA Club World Cup final, which saw Chelsea beat PSG, was the most bet-on football match of 2025 for Entain's brands, with strong engagement coming from Brazil, Spain and the US.

Interest in horse racing surged with the Royal Ascot and the Epsom Derby Festival both among the most bet-on competitions, while Wimbledon Tennis and the Women's Euro football tournament were also drawing in bets.

Entain nonetheless reported a pre-tax loss of £96 million for the first half, swinging from a £13.7 million profit the prior year which the firm said was driven by one-off costs.

On an underlying basis, earnings before tax, interest and other costs came in at £583.4 million for the period – 11% higher than last year.

The company said it was now expecting higher sales growth for the year than its previous outlook, with online net gaming revenues forecast to rise by 7%.

Annual underlying earnings are estimated to be between £1.1 billion and £1.15 billion.

ATLANTA (AP) — Human rights scandals have marred World Cup tournaments for years, but FIFA is testing a new protocol requiring all host committees to develop action plans to protect human rights for the 2026 games in North America.

With the games less than a year away, though, FIFA's commitment to upholding human rights is still under scrutiny. Human rights advocates who wanted more enforceable standards and clearer directions for local officials say FIFA watered down a more robust model for the plans. 

“Even though where we landed is very different than what we had consulted them on, the existence of the framework is in many ways unprecedented. Sports bodies have not had human rights frameworks that reflected the breadth of issues covered across so many jurisdictions. But the plan is just a plan. It's not self-executing,” said Jennifer Li, director of the O'Neill Institute's Center for Community Health Innovation at Georgetown Law and national coordinator of the Dignity 2026 Coalition, which is working with FIFA on human rights.

Adding to advocates' unease, several U.S. host committees said they couldn't meet a March deadline for an early draft of their plans. A FIFA spokesperson said the governing body has been working closely with host cities and counties, which they say are on track to develop final action plans by the Aug. 29 deadline. Sixteen North American sites will host games, including 11 in the U.S.

Human rights concerns in North America look different from those in other countries where FIFA has come under fire, which had few protections for workers and massive stadium and transportation construction projects. Migrant workers labored in Qatar's scorching heat for more than a decade before the 2022 World Cup there, and human rights advocates worry migrant workers' lives are again at risk in Saudi Arabia, which will host the games in 2034.

FIFA's suggestions for the 2026 plans include guidelines on nondiscrimination, security, preventing trafficking, protecting unhoused people and workers' rights, including for migrant workers.

“The host communities are quite invested in their legacy, so they've stepped up,” said labor rights expert Deborah Greenfield, who is in an expert advisory group supporting FIFA's human rights work for 2026.

U.S. President Donald Trump has ramped up immigration enforcement across the country, stirring fears that federal law enforcement officers will arrest workers and even travelers during the games. Trump imposed a travel ban on 12 countries in June, and seven face restrictions. 

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has close ties to Trump. A FIFA spokesperson said it is working with a White House task force to “bring millions of people from different nations and communities” together in the U.S.

Protesters in Miami-Dade County gathered outside FIFA's offices in June to demand that the governing body protect travelers and workers and speak out against Trump's immigration moves. That came after a Club World Cup event hosted in the area by Spanish-language TV network Telemundo was canceled after an unexpected Coast Guard inspection involving at least one Border Patrol agent, local outlets reported.

“There's no guarantee that you might not have ICE posted up at the World Cup,” South Florida AFL-CIO President Jeff Mitchell said.

Local organizers don't seem to have their human rights plan ready and haven't agreed to meet with the union, Mitchell said. He noted that the region has a history of wage theft in a state with weak heat protection laws for workers.

“Organizations like FIFA like to say that they have these human rights efforts, but they aren't pushing it,” Mitchell said. “They're leaving it up to the locals to do it. What tends to happen is everybody gets their bag and then they turn a blind eye to making sure people are getting paid properly or not being harassed.”

Miami-Dade officials referred The Associated Press to the local host committee, which did not respond to requests for comment. 

More than 9,000 unhoused people were arrested when Atlanta prepared to host the Olympics in 1996, and a plan to eliminate homelessness downtown before the World Cup worries advocates that unhoused people will be jailed again. 

Atlanta officials and partners say the Downtown Rising plan is a part of the mayor's larger investments in reducing homelessness and building affordable housing. The goal is to house people, not put them in jail, officials say.

In California, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom called on cities to ban encampments in May and offered money for mental health and substance use treatment. Cities with impending sporting events have ramped up enforcement, including San Jose, where unhoused people who reject three offers of shelter will now be eligible for arrest on trespassing charges. The mayor said the policy would encourage people to move inside. 

“This panic rush to disappear visible signs of poverty is very concerning,” said Dr. Mark Spencer, an Atlanta hospital physician involved in local advocacy. “Politicians and the business community know that visible signs of poverty are unpopular, and that's the driving force behind what is happening. It's not about human rights in any meaningful way.”

FIFA's human rights policy published in 2017 mandates bidders for the men's 2026 World Cup to respect “international human rights and labor standards according to the United Nations' guiding principles.” 

A group of international lawyers filed a formal complaint to FIFA in May claiming the soccer body is failing to uphold its human rights policy with 2034 World Cup host Saudi Arabia.

In North America, Greenfield said FIFA is taking the goal of having a tournament “that respects and promotes human rights” seriously and she wouldn't be participating in the effort if she didn't think that was possible.

Candace Stanciel, Atlanta's chief equity officer, said the city was committed to human rights work before FIFA came in and launched efforts to combat human trafficking in airports, hotels and public transport. Officials are working on potential language tools, accessibility measures for people with disabilities and an app to report issues including human rights abuses.

One of Seattle's largest labor organizations and the city's organizing committee signed a labor standards agreement last year. The International Labour Organization called FIFA's human rights framework “an important step forward in harnessing the power of sport to advance decent work globally,” adding that it aligns with international labor standards.

Three countries have been banned from competing at the World Cup because of political reasons, following sanctions from the United Nations.

At present, Russia remain suspended from competing in international football and instead have been playing unofficial friendly fixtures against the likes of Belarus, Nigeria, Zambia and Grenada in recent times.

The suspension was announced by FIFA and UEFA in May 2022 amid the invasion of Ukraine and a number of European associations refusing to play Russia.

Russia appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport but were unsuccessful in their efforts - though in March The Independent reported that ""moves are currently happening to get Russia back into football"".

For the upcoming 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada, eight countries were banned from competing in qualifying for a multitude of reasons.

A good chunk of World Cup bans have been for football reasons, including Mexico in 1990 for fielding overage players at the World Youth Championships and Japan for missed payments back in 1950.

But only three have been blocked from World Cup participation because of a political element.

Having been hosts for the 2018 edition, Russia were banned from both the 2022 and 2026 World Cup tournaments because of the Ukraine invasion and the fact that England, Poland, and Sweden had said they would not play them.

Advert

The ban extends to the youth and women's teams and also applies to the European Championships, with Russian sides also not permitted to play in UEFA competitions.

In 2022, Russia had progressed to play-offs for World Cup qualifying but their tie with Poland was cancelled and their opponents received a bye to the next round.

Back in 1992, with United Nations sanctions against the country, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was banned from international football following on from the dissolving of Yugoslavia.

They had finished top of their qualifying group for Euro 92 but received the suspension just 10 days before and were replaced by Denmark, who went on to win the competition. The ban extended to qualifying for the 1994 World Cup and when it was lifted, the union of Serbia and Montenegro continued under the name before being renamed in 2003 and qualifying for the 2006 World Cup with that title.

Both would go on to gain full independence and split to compete as separate nations.

The second World Cup host, South Africa put on a memorable festival of football in 2010 but they were banned by FIFA in 1961 during the period of racial apartheid.

Advert

The ban was lifted in 1963 following a visit from hen-FIFA President Stanley Rous and there was talk of South African FA proposing playing an all-white team for the 1966 World Cup and team made up of back players four years later.

The idea was rejected and the South African FA was suspended by FIFA in 1965 and later expelled two years later when Joao Havelange became FIFA president.

Their reinstating came in 1992 and they went on to win the Africa Cup of Nations in 1996.

How do we fill the days until the 2026 World Cup? By keeping up with some of the world's top sides in what will be an action-packed European club season. 

Three of the continent's Big Five circuits – England's Premier League, Spain's La Liga and Ligue 1 in France – kick off this weekend, with Germany's Bundesliga and Italy's Serie A following on Aug. 22 and 23, respectively. In other countries, domestic league action is already underway. 

But these are the 20 clubs to watch, loaded with the stars we'll be seeing next summer. Ahead of the top European campaigns kicking off, let's count down the teams who'll shine the brightest.

Note: League positions reflect last season's finish.

So what if the defending European champions lost decisively to Chelsea in last month's FIFA Club World Cup final? Luis Enrique's PSG is still the team to beat in 2025-26. Luis Enrique returns close to his entire squad from last season's long-awaited triumph, though keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma could leave this month. If he does, the Parisians already have Donnarumma's replacement in French international Lucas Chevalier, who arrived from Lille for $47 million.   

Last year, the Reds ran away with the Premier League title, besting second-place Arsenal by 10 points. Despite the tragic death of forward Diogo Jota, Liverpool has only gotten better this summer. Arne Slot's side has been the big winner of this transfer window, dropping north of $350 million on backup keeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, defenders Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, and forwards Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz. No wonder they're the favorites to retain the English title.

Baca was just seconds away from reaching the UEFA Champions League final last season under first-year manager Hansi Flick. This season, the Blaugrana are looking to go at least one step further. Who says they can't? Eighteen-year-old Lamine Yamal is on his way to becoming the world's best player — if he isn't already. Fellow Ballon d'Or candidate Raphinha had 34 goals in all competitions in 2024-25, doubling his previous career-best. Robert Lewandowski, who turns 37 on Aug. 21, remains an elite striker. Pedri runs the show behind them. The rest of the regulars return, too, with forward Marcus Rashford the marquee summer addition. 

After finishing fourth in the Prem last term, the Blues stunned many by winning the expanded, 32-team Club World Cup in July. Can they harness that momentum and use it to challenge for English and European titles next spring? They've got the firepower. Chelsea already have an emerging superstar in winger Cole Palmer — this season he'll be supported by new recruits like strikers Liam Delap and João Pedro, Pedro's fellow Brazilian attacker Estêvão, and English forward Jamie Gittens.

The Premier League runner-up in each of the last three seasons, what Mikel Arteta's team is missing at this point are trophies. Still, Arsenal continues to improve. The Gunners knocked then-Champions League holders Real Madrid out of Europe's top club tournament last April, snaring a convincing 5-1 aggregate win. And they've added real quality this summer in the form of defensive midfielder Martín Zubimendi and forwards Viktor Gyökeres and Noni Madueke. 

The record 15-time European champs are coming off what, by their standards, was a dreadful 2024-25, with no major titles secured. But Los Blancos still boast one of the deepest, most expensive squads on Planet Fútbol. And Kylian Mbappé & Co. are now led by one of the sport's great up-and-coming coaches in former Real Madrid captain Xabi Alonso, who replaced the legendary Carlo Ancelotti in June. 

City's unprecedented run of four consecutive Premier League titles came to a halt last season, when Pep Guardiola's side finished third, lost the FA Cup final to Crystal Palace, and were eliminated from European play before the Champions League's round of 16 even began. This team is too good not to bounce back in a big way this year, though — even without club legend Kevin de Bruyne, whose contract wasn't extended. 

Having reached the UEFA Champions League final in two of the last three seasons, nobody should underestimate the Nerazzurri. Inter added Croatian midfielder Petar Sučić, Brazilian winger Luis Henrique and French striker Ange-Yoan Bonny this summer. Besides veteran forward Joaquín Correa, their most significant departure is manager Simone Inzaghi, who was replaced by former Inter defender Cristian Chivu in June. 

After losing the German title to Bayer Leverkusen in 2023-24, Bayern reclaimed its status as the Bundesliga's standard-bearer last season, finishing as champs for the 12th time in 13 seasons.  Things will be different this year without club legend (and new Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder) Thomas Müller, with Leroy Sané leaving, too. But the $81 million arrival of Colombian winger Luis Díaz from Liverpool will help.

Can Atleti end their four-year title drought and beat Barcelona and Real Madrid to La Liga glory this season? Occasionally, Madrid's other team outlasts Spain's double-headed monster. Longtime manager Diego Simeone will be hoping his team is due after a strong summer transfer window which saw $185 million-worth of new talent arrive — including former Villarreal attacker Álex Baena, USMNT midfielder Johnny Cardoso and Argentine World Cup-winner (and Atlanta United alum) Thiago Almada. 

Scudetto winners in 2023 and 2025, the Neapolitans are no doubt aiming for similar success in European play this season to celebrate the club's centennial. The arrival of Champions League winner Kevin de Bruyne on a free transfer from Manchester City can't hurt. Neither will forward Noa Lang, who helped PSV reach the knockout stage in each of the last two years. 

The Magpies eked into the Champions League places last term only because UEFA granted England's top flight one additional spot. Newcastle fans aren't complaining though, though they will be if and when star forward Alexander Isak leaves for Liverpool on the eve of the new season. 

Juve got the proven, consistent goalscorer they've long needed when the ""Old Lady"" inked Canadian striker Jonathan David on a free transfer from Lille following the Concacaf Gold Cup. David replaces Randal Kolo Muani, who returned to PSG upon the completion of his loan, in manager Igor Tudor's lineup.

The club that helped develop the all-world likes of Jude Bellingham and Erling Haaland in recent years has a new batch coming through — one led by midfielder Jobe Bellingham, Jude's younger brother. But most of the vets that took the Black & Yellow to the 2024 Champions League final remain, not least captain Emre Can, playmaker Julian Brandt and Swiss keeper Gregor Kobel. 

It's hard to believe that the 20-time English champions finished 15th last season, when they also lost the Europa League final to Premier League rivals Tottenham. But the Red Devils added forwards Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Šeško this window, and they should fare better in Ruben Amorim's first full season at the Old Trafford helm. 

Plenty of big names — think Mbappé, Thierry Henry and George Weah — have come through the Principality over the years. AS Monaco added a few more this summer in former France World Cup winner Paul Pogba and Barcelona loanee Ansu Fati. Both should help in the Champions League, with Les Rouge et Blancs looking to reach the round of 16 for the first time since 2017. 

The loss of star attractions Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong (both to Liverpool) and manager Xabi Alonso (to Real Madrid) hurts. Same for Odilon Kossounou and Granit Xhaka, who also left this summer. But stout defender Jarell Quansah, fellow $40 million man (and USMNT star) Malik Tillman, and new boss Eric ten Hag should help keep the club near the top of the Bundesliga. 

As Dutch champs the last two years, PSV has also pushed above its weight in the Champions League, reaching the knockout stages twice and knocking out Italian titans Juventus last season. They lost Tillman, Lang and others this summer, but having USMNT pair Sergiño Dest and Ricardo Pepi back healthy this season could be a coup for coach Peter Bosz.

The Champions League-bound Turkish giants made waves this summer by signing prolific 26-year-old Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen from Napoli for $87 million on a permanent deal, as well as bringing in German winger Leroy Sané for free from Bayern Munich. 

The Ligue 1 runner-up to PSG last year and three times overall this decade, Marseille is chasing its first domestic title since 2010. The ambition is there, with L'OM dropping almost $90 million on transfers this summer. Yet two potentially huge contributors came for free: former Arsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and USMNT veteran Tim Weah, who previously won a French title with Lille in 2020-21.

Want to volunteer at the FIFA World Cup next year when matches are played in Boston? It's time to apply.

The FIFA World Cup 2026 is calling for more than 65,000 volunteers to help out in the soccer tournament's 16 host cities.

New Englanders can volunteer at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, where the Boston matches will be played, organizers said.

Other Boston-area volunteers might be stationed at local hotels and airports.

To become a volunteer, you'll need to be at least 18 years old at the time of application and able to speak English, FIFA said.

To be eligible, you'll also need to comply with the entry requirements of the host country, whether it be the United States, Canada, or Mexico.

Prospective volunteers will also have to pass a background check and attend volunteer team tryouts.

All volunteers must commit to eight shifts between June 11 and July 19, 2026, organizers said.

You can apply to be a volunteer on the FIFA website.

Volunteers will receive an official World Cup 26 volunteer uniform, meals and refreshments, an exclusive reward and recognition items, and a volunteer certificate for their service, organizers said.

More information can be found on the Boston FIFA World Cup 2026 website.

Seven soccer matches will be hosted at Foxboro's Gillette Stadium over the course of the tournament. Here's the schedule:

Ruben Amorim is putting together a squad capable of competing towards the top of the table, and adding the Cameroonian would be a game-changer

""We were the better team, but in the end if you don't score goals, you can't win matches."" That was Ruben Amorim's assessment of Manchester United's defeat in the Europa League final to Tottenham. He declined, however, to state whether the Pope was Catholic or whether bears tend to go to the bathroom in woods. 

But while the coach was stating the obvious, he was also underlining United's biggest problem, and this summer the club have made solving it their biggest priority, spending more than £200 million ($269m) to give Amorim a shiny new front three of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. If United do not manage to seriously improve on their attacking numbers this season then they will only have themselves to blame, and Amorim will have a lot of questions to answer.

Unless something goes terribly wrong, United should score a lot more goals, even if they are unlikely to be a complete team ready to take on Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal in the title race. Their free-spending has not changed the fact that they are still lacking balance and are particularly ill-equipped in midfield, arguably the most important area of all.

The club can, though, address that issue by signing Carlos Baleba from Brighton. The move would take the club's spending to a colossal £300m ($404.5m), but it would also be a game-changing transfer that could actually turn Amorim's side into Premier League title contenders. And if they are serious about returning to the elite, they need to make it happen.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Many in north London would've liked to see more of the 19-year-old this term, but her time is better spent elsewhere in the Women's Super League

No one announced themselves at the 2025 European Championship quite like Michelle Agyemang. The 19-year-old was a relative unknown in her own country, never mind on the continent, before the tournament got underway. Her efforts in Switzerland, though, would help propel England to a successful title defence, while securing individual glory for herself in the form of the Best Young Player award and a spot on the list of nominees for the Kopa Trophy, announced last week.

Yet, as the focus starts to turn towards the new club season, many who watched Agyemang rifle in vital goals against Sweden and Italy in the Euro 2025 quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively, will have been surprised to see the Mirror report that Arsenal are in discussions with Brighton about sending the teenager back on loan to the south coast, where she spent the last campaign, rather than factoring her into their own first-team plans for the coming year. This is just a few weeks after Agyemang showed incredible composure in front of goal and all-round quality to be a regular game-changer for one of the best national teams in the women's game.

But while this summer was certainly an indication that the striker would be capable of making an impact at Arsenal this season, the right move for Agyemang, the Gunners and even England right now is another temporary switch.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The rivalry continues to heat up between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz.

In 2024, the youngsters left no doubt they are the world's two best players by sharing the Grand Slams between them, and the trend has continued in 2025.

In their latest battle, Sinner defeated Alcaraz to become the Wimbledon champion for the first time.

With the tennis circuit now on the road to the US Open, Sinner, the defending champion at Flushing Meadows, will be under threat from Carlos Alcaraz not only for the title, but his world number one ranking.

Jannik Sinner has been at the summit of the ATP rankings since June 2024, when he overtook Novak Djokovic.

The Italian currently has a 3440-point lead over world number two Alcaraz, but the Spaniard currently leads the race to the ATP Finals in Turin.

Should Alcaraz win the US Open and Sinner lose early, the points deficit could swing in his favour and with three months of the season remaining, the 22-year-old has every chance of reaching the top of the ATP rankings by the end of the year.

Furthermore, Steve Johnson of the ‘Nothing Major' podcast thinks Alcaraz will usurp Sinner at the top of the rankings by the end of the year.

“I think Carlos ends the year as number one and he also had a three month head start,” Johnson said. “Sinner was out for four Masters series, so I just think he gets him. But it entirely depends on the big events. You win the Open and it's 2000 points.

“One of these guys loses kind of early. You lose in the quarters and somebody wins it and they are going to get a 1500 point head start just from that event.

“But I think Carlos gets him at the end of the year. I think after his loss at Wimbledon, I think that was a kick in the pants for him to be like I need to be better.”

Alcaraz and Sinner's rivalry went up a level this season, as each of their three matches in 2025 have taken place in the final.

Two of these matches occurred in the finals of Grand Slams. Alcaraz won a classic match at the French Open, while Sinner won their Wimbledon encounter in four sets.

There is every chance the pair could square off in the US Open final in September, but while that remains to be seen, Johnson thinks there will be at least two more Sinner and Alcaraz matches in 2025.

“These guys are pushing each other. They see what they are doing, it's the same with Roger, Rafa and Novak. They push each other to get better,” Johnson said.

“So he sees how good Jannik is playing on hard courts. He is going to solely work on how to beat Jannik, because he feels like he can beat everybody else on Tour.

“This is going to be a great rivalry and I think we are going to see them in a couple more finals throughout the year. I would love to see them in the US Open final, that would be electric, but we are a long way from that.”","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Jannik Sinner's 2025 ATP Tour campaign has been one for the ages, as he continues to dominate the men's game.

In January, Sinner won his third Grand Slam title at the Australian Open, defeating Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6, 6-3, in the final.

He then encountered one of the biggest setbacks of his career, as Sinner was suspended for three months, bringing an end to the ‘Clostebol' saga.

Returning on the clay, Sinner reached the final of the Italian Open and French Open, but came up short against Carlos Alcaraz on both occasions.

Finally getting one over on his biggest rival, Sinner defeated Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final to win his second major of the year.

Sitting pretty atop the ATP rankings, with two of the three Grand Slams in his back pocket, things couldn't be going much better for Sinner, although that's not to say he hasn't been embroiled in controversy.

Sinner's fellow Italian and national tennis hero, Nicola Pietrangeli, has made several comments about the world number one that haven't gone down well.

However, looking to clarify his thoughts on Sinner, Pietrangeli has now claimed that the media were twisting his words.

During an interview with Super Tennis, Italian tennis legend Pietrangeli suggested the media have been forcing a false narrative about him and Sinner.

“Interviews? They change my words, that's enough,” he said.

“You know, in the end, what I don't understand is how people can think I want to speak badly of [Jannik] Sinner because I'm jealous.

“But why? Why should I speak badly of him? How dare they?”

Recently discharged from hospital, Pietrangeli made a joke about the costs of healthcare, referring to Sinner once more.

“Everything they tell me has a cost,” he said.

“But I'm not as rich as Sinner… and I'm just joking because I can already see they're going to start another controversy.”

During an interview last November, Pietrangeli claimed Sinner would never break his Davis Cup record, suggesting he would need ‘three or four lifetimes' to do so.

Pietrangeli holds the record for most Davis Cup matches played and won, which, in fairness, is likely to stand the test of time.

Earlier this year, when the 23-year-old won his second consecutive Australian Open title, Pietrangeli suggested Sinner's win over Zverev was ‘boring'.

Whilst the headline quotes don't always paint Pietrangeli in the best light, in his defense, he does often qualify such statements with praise for the Italian world number one.

The 91-year-old clearly has a lot of respect for Sinner, as the youngster builds on the legacy he started in 1959.

At the 1959 French Open, Pietrangeli became the first Italian player to win a major title, defeating Ian Vermaak in the final.

Defending his title a year later, Pietrangeli eventually retired with two Grand Slam titles to his name.

65 years on, Italian players have won seven more majors, as the nation begins to establish itself as a true tennis superpower.

As a country, Italy has won nine Grand Slam titles, a number that is likely to increase over the coming years.

Not only is Sinner a threat at all four majors, but Jasmine Paolini and Lorenzo Musetti have both shown how dangerous they can be on clay and grass courts over the past 18 months.

Whether any of the trio can add a tenth Grand Slam title to their nation's tally in New York next month remains to be seen, but it will certainly be worth tuning in for.

The 2025 US Open is scheduled to begin on Sunday, August 24.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Mensik – Nardi: 12.08.2025 18:30 CEST
H2H: 1-0

Jakub Mensik has won three of his last five matches. This week in Cincinnati, Mensik defeated Quinn in his opening match. He served great, not offering any breakpoints. He hopes for a solid result this week to get closer to the top 10 in the rankings.

Luca Nardi has won three of his last five matches. This week in Cincinnati, Nardi failed to qualify for the main draw tournament. However, with several players withdrawing from the tournament, the Italian entered the main draw as a lucky loser. In the second main draw round, he upset Shapovalov in three tight sets, after losing the opening set 6-7.

According to the bookies, Mensik is the favourite in this matchup, and we agree. He is a better hard-court player than Nardi. Last season in Miami under similar conditions, Mensik demolished Nardi in straight sets, and we expect a similar outcome tonight.

That being said, Mensik covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Jakub Mensik -3.5 games handicap @1.73 @bet365

Nakashima – Zverev: 13.08.2025 01:00 CEST
H2H: 0-4

Brandon Nakashima has won three of his last five matches. Last week in Toronto, Nakashima lost to Shelton in the third round in three tight sets. This week in Cincinnati, the American won the opening match against Blockx in three tight sets. After losing the opening set 4-6, he stepped up his level and turned the match around.

Alexander Zverev has won four of his last five matches. Last week in Toronto, Zverev lost to Khachanov in the semifinals in three tight sets. This week in Cincinnati, he defeated Basavareddy in the opening round in straight sets. He served great, not offering any breakpoints.

According to the bookies, Zverev is the favourite in this matchup, and we agree. He is in solid form and leads 4-0 in head-to-head meetings against Nakashima. He has all the weapons to dominate tonight.

That being said, Zverev covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Alexander Zverev -3.5 games handicap @2.00 @bet365

Shelton – Bautista-Agut: 13.08.2025 02:30 CEST
H2H: 2-0

Ben Shelton has won seven straight matches. Last week in Toronto, Shelton won the Masters 1000 title. He defeated Khachanov in the final in three tight sets. This week in Cincinnati, Ugo Carabelli retired mid-match in the opening match against Shelton.

Roberto Bautista-Agut has won three of his last five matches. This week in Cincinnati, the Spaniard won both matches in straight sets. Last season in Cincinnati, the Spaniard failed to qualify for the main draw of the tournament.

According to the bookies, Shelton is the big favourite in this matchup, and we agree. He is in great form and is one of the best players in the world. He defeated the Spaniard in both head-to-head meetings in straight sets. We expect him to do so tonight as well.

That being said, Shelton covering the games handicap is a value bet.

French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz will take on Hamad Medjedovic at the Cincinnati Masters on Tuesday. The third-round schedule also includes a showdown between Andrey Rublev and Alexei Popyrin.

(2) Carlos Alcaraz vs. Hamad Medjedovic

Carlos Alcaraz hasn't played an event since he lost the Wimbledon final to Jannik Sinner–and it showed in his second-round win over Damir Dzumhur at the Western & Southern Open. The Spaniard was scratchy, dropping the second set before he righted the ship in the third. Cincinnati will be Alcaraz's only event prior to the U.S. Open in a couple of weeks.

Hamad Medjedovic is ranked 72nd in the world. The Serb's best result of the season (by far) came on the hard courts of Marseille, where he lost in the final to Ugo Humbert. Like Alcaraz, Medjedovic has played no other events since Wimbledon; unlike Alcaraz, he lost in the opening round at the All-England Club. His best results have come on hard courts, but a player of Alcaraz's caliber is going to be a big ask. Despite Alcaraz's slow start to the North American hard-court swing, look for him to advance in straight sets.

(9) Andrey Rublev vs. (21) Alexei Popyrin

Andrey Rublev has endured an inconsistent season. The world No. 11 won the title in Doha, but his Grand Slam results have been lackluster. He was knocked out of the Australian Open in the first round and in the round of 16 at the French Open and Wimbledon. Rublev plays a ton of tennis; Cincinnati marks his 20th tournament of the season.

Unfortunately for Rublev, Alexei Popyrin is a known quantity for the Russian. Popyrin won their two most recent matches, both in 2024 in Monte Carlo and Montreal. Rublev is a player whose results reflect how much confidence–or lack thereof–he has. He at least made a good run to the quarters last week in Toronto, which bodes well for his form in Cincy. Interestingly, Popyrin also made the quarters in Toronto. He upset Daniil Medvedev and Holger Rune last week, so he will be playing with confidence. With both men in decent enough form, look for this one to go the distance.

Nine's Wide World of Sports

Emma Raducanu complained to the umpire about a crying child and was applauded by sections of the crowd in her narrow third round loss to world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka in Cincinnati.

It was the pair's second meeting of the year after Sabalenka edged the Brit in their third-round encounter at Wimbledon, but this one had more spice.

With the match all square at one set apiece and with Raducanu serving at 3-4 in the third, tensions rose as the Brit was forced to fight off several break points.

At one point as she stepped up to serve, the 2021 US Open champion stopped her motion when a child cried out. She turned to the umpire and said: ""It's been, like, 10 minutes.""

Emma Raducanu complains to the umpire. X

The umpire replied: ""It's a child. Do you want me to kick the child out of the stadium?""

When members of the crowd replied ""yes"", the British No.1 shrugged and smiled.

As Raducanu towelled herself, the umpire said: ""I can call in, but we need to continue for the moment.""

The tense clash continued and Raducanu ended up holding her serve to level the scores at 4-4 in the third.

Both players held serve until it went to a tiebreak in the final set, with Sabalenka pulling through to win it 7-5.

Sabalenka took the match 7-6(3), 4-6, 7-6(5).

""Happy to get through this match,"" Sabalenka said in her on-court interview. ""I really hope I have a day tomorrow.""

Raducanu opened the match by winning eight straight points. but a double fault on the ninth point swung things for Sabalenka, who took the first frame in around an hour.

Another close contest followed in the second as both players held their serve in the early stages, before Raducanu managed to shift the momentum by winning a break point in the seventh game to take the lead and eventually the set, 6-4.

Sabalenka has now won all three career meetings with Raducanu, who has lost 11 of 12 matches against top five players.

She's currently working with Francisco Roig, who coached Rafael Nadal from 2005-2022.

Swiatek: ‘I'm just proud of myself'

Top-ranked Iga Swiatek has beaten 18-year-old American Coco Gauff 6-1, 6-3 in the French Open final to collect her second title at Roland Garros and stretch her winning streak to 35 matches.

Swiatek's unbeaten run equals one by Venus Williams in 2000 as the longest this century.





Swiatek's victory over Gauff on Saturday allowed her to add to the 2020 trophy she won in Paris. That made her the first player from Poland to win a Grand Slam singles title. Swiatek has now won her past six tournaments and is 42-3 this season. Swiatek's last loss came in February to 2017 Roland Garros champion Jelena Ostapenko.

Swiatek is unbeaten since February and sure looks unbeatable at the moment. Gauff, appearing in her first Grand Slam final at just 18, never stood much of a chance, like most opponents against Swiatek lately.

The post Coco Gauff reflects on Wimbledon upset before Cincinatti Open rematch appeared first on ClutchPoints.

One week ago, Coco Gauff lost in the National Bank Open in Montreal. But as she goes through the Cincinnati Open, she looks back at her most disappointing loss.

In June, No. 2 Gauff lost in the first round at Wimbledon to No. 42 Dayana Yastremska. Now she is set to take on Yastremska in the third round at Cincinnati. She defeated Wang Xinyu (6-3, 6-2) in the second round on Sunday.

Gauff is looking ahead to the challenge with the proper mindset, per Peter Lynch of The Tennis Gazette.

“I don't ever think of revenge-type tennis,” she said. “At first I used to think like that but then I am like I have to play too many people too many times to have a revenge mindset.“

“I think for me it's a good measure to see where my game is. I thought that Wimbledon match was a tough loss for me and I don't think I approached it well.

Upon reflection, Gauff compliments Yastremska for being a formidable opponent.

“I always have trouble against her, she is a tough opponent, great ball striker who can pull winners out of anywhere” she said.

“So it will be a tough test for me, especially having to play her again, but I think I have had more time to work on things in the hard court season and I definitely think it's a better surface than grass for me.

As for the upcoming match, Gauff exuded confidence in her abilities.

“So it's going to be a tough match but I am looking forward to it and hopefully I can do better than Wimby” Gauff said.

Gauff is looking to recapture the magic she had in winning in the French Open.

In 2023, Gauff won her first Cincinnati Open, her first WTA 1000 singles title. The victory opened the door into what Gauff had in the making as a top-notch professional player.

A few weeks later, Gauff dramatically won the U.S. Open. In 2024, Gauff lost in the third round of the Cincinnati Open to Yulia Putintseva (6-4, 2-6, 6-4).

It was also during the Cincinnati Open that Gauff solidified herself as a fashion icon. This year, she represented two brands, New Balance x Miu Miu collaboration.

...

NEW YORK (AP) — Three-time Grand Slam semifinalist Grigor Dimitrov withdrew from the U.S. Open on Tuesday, a little more than a month after he tore a chest muscle and had to quit playing against Jannik Sinner at Wimbledon.

That exit from the All England Club on July 7 — Dimitrov had taken the opening two sets against Sinner but got hurt in the third — marked the fifth consecutive Grand Slam tournament where the 34-year-old Dimitrov failed to complete a match. It also happened at the Australian Open in January and the French Open in May, plus last year's Wimbledon and U.S. Open.

A year ago in New York, Dimitrov stopped while trailing 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3, 4-1 against Frances Tiafoe in the quarterfinals.

Dimitrov was a semifinalist at the U.S. Open in 2019, at the Australian Open in 2017, and at Wimbledon in 2014.

His highest ranking was No. 3; he is currently No. 21.

With Dimitrov out of the field, Alejandro Tabilo gets a spot in the men's singles bracket, which starts play on Aug. 24.

Brandon Holt is the next player who would move into the draw if another man withdraws. Holt upset Taylor Fritz at Flushing Meadows in 2022 and his mother is two-time U.S. Open champion Tracy Austin.

Third round singles action continues on Tuesday.

Last month at Wimbledon, Coco Gauff was upset in the first round by Dayana Yastremska.  On Tuesday, they meet again in the third round of the Cincinnati Open.

Plus, Carlos Alcaraz, Jessica Pegula, and Jasmine Paolini will alsoplay their third round matches.  And in a battle between two Masters 1000 champions, Andrey Rublev takes on Alexei Popyrin.

Throughout the tournament, this preview will analyze the day's two most prominent matches, while highlighting the other notable matches on the schedule.  Tuesday's play gets underway at 11:00am local time.



Alexei Popyrin (21) vs. Andrey Rublev (9) – 11:00am on Court 3

Rublev's two Masters 1000 titles both came on clay, though he was a finalist four years ago in Cincinnati.  However, across the past 52 weeks, he's just 7-9 at Masters level, and just 8-4 at Majors.  But he did reach the quarterfinals last week in Canada, and in his opening round on Sunday, avenged a recent loss in Washington against Learner Tien.

Popyrin was the surprise champion last summer in Canada, and also reached the quarterfinals last week, eventually losing a tight match to third-seeded Alexander Zverev.  The Australian also achieved a quarterfinal here two years ago, yet this year he's struggled, and owns a losing record.  Perhaps no longer having the defense of the Canada points looming over him will free up Alexei's play.

And Popyrin has actually taken two of three meetings with Rublev, which includes the final of Canada, Alexei's biggest win of his career.  Both players possess formidable forehands, but Popyrin is the one with the bigger serve.  Having won their last two matches, I give Alexei the slight edge to prevail again on Tuesday.



Dayana Yastremska (32) vs. Coco Gauff (2) – Not Before 3:00pm on Center Court

In the first round of The Championships, Gauff fell in straight sets to Yastremska, as grass continues to trouble the two-time Major singles champion.  On a surface that invites winners, Coco struck only six in that match, and committed 29 unforced errors.  Then in Montreal, Gauff's service woes resurfaced, hitting as many as 23 double faults in a match.  Yet the 2025 champion played well on Sunday, defeating Xinyu Wang 6-3, 6-2, just weeks after the same player upset Coco on grass in Berlin.

Yastremska is now 31-17 on the year, and has advanced to a pair of WTA finals, in Linz and Nottingham.  But as per Tennis Abstract, her Wimbledon victory over Gauff was her first top 10 win in 18 months.  Dayana has a pretty big game, but she can also become error-prone at times, and she does not possess the same great movement that Coco has.

Prior to their Wimbledon matchup, Gauff has claimed their other three encounters, though she did bizarrely drop the first set to Yastremska this past April in Madrid by a score of 6-0.  While the fast-playing conditions in Cincy are to Dayana's liking, I still favor Coco to avenge a recent loss for the second consecutive round.



Other Notable Matches on Tuesday:

Hamad Medjedovic vs. Carlos Alcaraz (2) – As has been the theme of his season, Alcaraz did not play his best tennis in his opening round on Sunday, yet still managed to beat Damir Dzumhur in three sets.  This is his first encounter with Medjedovic, who upset 26th-seeded Tallon Griekspoor in the last round.

Jasmine Paolini (7) vs.  Ashlyn Krueger (26) – Paolini defeated Maria Sakkari on Sunday via a pair of sets decided by tiebreaks.  On the same, Krueger required three sets to overcome Anastasija Sevastova, as the 21-year-old American now looks to equal her best WTA 1000 result to date by advancing to the fourth round.  This is a first-time meeting.

Magda Linette (31) vs. Jessica Pegula (4) – Pegula defeated Kimberly Birrell in straights in her opening round, to record just her second victory since the start of Wimbledon.  She is 3-0 against Linette, and has claimed all six sets they've contested.

Brandon Nakashima (26) vs. Sascha Zverev (3) – Zverev has reached the semifinals or better in his last three Cincinnati appearances, taking the title back in 2021.  He has won all four times he's faced Nakashima, though all four matches have been pretty tight.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Why did a professional cyclist struggle to watch Jannik Sinner win Wimbledon?","https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/professional-cyclist-lizzy-banks-struggle-jannik-sinner-wimbledon-10184513/","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 11:17:49 GMT","

Lizzy Banks, a professional women's cyclist who had failed a drugs test and was eventually given a two-year ban, says she struggled to watch Jannik Sinner play the Wimbledon final. 

“I can't tell you how difficult it was to watch Wimbledon this year. I watched the men's final and I didn't expect it to hit me like that, I was so upset. I want to make it clear that I don't think Jannik Sinner purposely took anything. He was given his zero-month sanction, like I was. It was appealed to CAS, like mine was. And then he got the most handy time, a three-month sanction, and then he was able to just go straight back to it,” Banks told The Times. “I was never even offered a deal, but I wouldn't have taken it anyway.

Her reaction was because of how her own career played out because of that ban. Initially, she was given no ban as UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) had agreed that there had been contamination and it was no fault of hers. But WADA refused to accept the opinion of UKAD's expert witness, professor David Cowan, and instead fought for and secured a two-year ban later. 

Her ordeal began in May 2023 when she took a routine urine test that led to a positive finding for a diuretic called Chrortalidone, which she claims she had not even heard of before. Her conclusion, and which was supported by the professor Cowan after his investigations, was that one of medications she took to treat asthma or a pill she took after a dental treatment perhaps had been contaminated in the manufacturing process. 

But CAS panel didn't agree to her version and though they described her as a “peroson of integrity”, said that she was unable to prove the source of the contamination and hence warranted a ban, which was back-dated and is now served. 

It's for this reason that she struggled to watch Sinner play and win Wimbledon. “Then they came out and said this case [Sinner's] is a million miles from doping. Well, how does that make me feel? Just because I'm little old me and nobody cares about me I have to go through hell, and he gets to go and win Wimbledon.”

She told The Times newspaper about how her life was completely upset after the ban. “I was an athlete of integrity who took the utmost care in her anti-doping responsibilities, who was unknowingly exposed to a contaminant-sized dose of an obsolete diuretic with an impossibility of tracing the source because of a 79-day delay. And so is that really proportional to my career being completely lost, my identity being lost, my health being destroyed for two years, my husband's health being destroyed for two years, loss of earnings for two years, the impact that will have on other earnings in the future. Is that proportional?”

Grigor Dimitrov has officially pulled out of the upcoming US Open, having struggled with an injury since Wimbledon earlier this year. The Bulgarian had been on the verge of a famous victory over eventual champion Jannik Sinner, but was forced to retire from the round-of-16 clash and hasn't been seen in competitive action since.

Dimitrov injured his pectoral muscle in the Sinner clash and has been unable to recover from the problem in time to line up at Flushing Meadows later this month. It brings to an end a streak of 58 Slam main draws in a row, which had been the longest active streak on the ATP Tour.

As a result of Dimitrov pulling out of the US Open, Alejandro Tabilo has been named as the 34-year-old's replacement. The world No.103 has competed in both the Australian and French Open main draws this year, reaching the first and second rounds respectively.

Speaking shortly after his Wimbledon withdrawal, Dimitrov posted on social media: ""Sometimes the heart wants to keep going… but the universe has a different plan for us,"" wrote Dimitrov in a post on Instagram, which included a photo of himself in a hospital bed. Having to withdraw from this match at Wimbledon was one of the most painful moments of my career.

""Thank you for the overwhelming wave of love - from family, friends, fans, colleagues, to the entire tennis community… your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times. Thank you all. Truly. Recovery starts now. I'll see you all soon. G.""

It was initially expected that Dimitrov would recover from the injury quickly, with talk of him being involved in the North American hard-court swing. However, it transpired that the original prognosis was worse than first thought, with Dimitrov firstly withdrawing from the Canadian Open and then the Cincinnati Open.

His manager, Georgi Stoimenov, appeared to float the idea of Dimitrov not being available for the US Open last month, claiming it was unlikely he'd be fully fit. Now, just a couple of weeks before the action in New York gets underway, his absence has been confirmed by the tournament organisers.

As well as losing his impressive Grand Slam streak, it's likely Dimitrov will also fall outside of the top 30 in the ATP rankings. He will have the chance to climb back up the standings at tournaments like the China Open and Shanghai Masters, but only if the Bulgarian star is fit enough to compete.

Jack Draper reveals he discovered an arm issue following his shock Wimbledon exit but has since returned to being fully healthy and highlights he is not lacking any motivation ahead of the US Open.

After Draper collected his maiden Masters crown in Indian Wells and broke into the top-5, high hopes were placed on him at Wimbledon. Those hopes of seeing the world No. 5 do well at The Championships were quickly squashed after he suffered a surprise second-round loss to Marin Cilic.

While Draper took all the responsibility and blame for his Wimbledon display, he later withdrew from the Masters tournaments in Toronto and Cincinnati, citing an injury. Now, in an interview with LTA, the 23-year-old said that after The Championships, he found out that he had been playing with an arm injury ""for a little while.""

“The doctors and my team advised me that I'd need to take some time out. I had a few days off, so I chilled and took my mind off tennis. Then I was really motivated to come back and do a really good fitness block and work myself hard physically to make some good gains,"" the world No. 5 told LTA.

After taking some time for himself and fixing his arm issue, Draper says he is in ""a great place"" now and ecstatic about taking to the US Open courts.   “I got back to my tennis slowly to protect my arm, but it's been a really productive few weeks now. It was disappointing to miss Toronto and Cincinnati, but I think it's been a good period for me to reflect on things and improve. I'm really looking forward to going out to the US Open, and I'm in a great place personally and tennis-wise. I feel refreshed, motivated, and I can't wait to get back out there,"" the Briton added.

Last year, Draper made his maiden Grand Slam semifinal at the US Open before losing to eventual champion Jannik Sinner. The world No. 5 not playing any matches ahead of the US Open definitely isn't ideal, but at least he is guaranteed to arrive to New York fresh and healthy.

CINCINNATI, Ohio — As the countdown to the US Open—and its polarizing mixed doubles event—continues, Jessica Pegula says a lack of communication between players and organizers is at the heart of the divide.The American No. 4 seed spoke after her second-round victory at the Cincinnati Open on Sunday, where she defeated Kimberly Birrell 6-4, 6-3. Pegula, who will team up with Tommy Paul at the revamped two-day tournament, said players weren't consulted before the major overhaul was announced.Read More: Katerina Siniakova, doubles No. 1, on not making US Open cutoff: ""Nothing more to say""“I'm honored that they asked me to play.

The US Open revealed the new format in February. The event will now take place during Fan Week over two days, with abbreviated “Fast 4” scoring. The most controversial change is the limited field of 16 teams—eight direct entries based on singles rankings, not doubles, and eight wild cards, a mix of fan favorites and doubles champions.Pegula, a member of the WTA's Player Council who co-signed a letter to the four Grand Slams calling for a greater share of profits for players, welcomed the initiative but said the lack of communication left players blindsided.Read More: US Open breathes new life into mixed doubles format with Fan Week revamp“We were like, Okay, you guys (US Open) just went rogue and changed the format and didn't tell anybody.

I think that's just something that we as players are trying to work with them on, having that line of communication be a lot smoother.“I feel like maybe if there was feedback about the format, then the (reaction) would be a little different, not so all over the place.”

Player feedback has been mixed, with many doubles specialists strongly opposed. Because of the singles ranking requirement, many top doubles players are effectively locked out—for example, doubles world No. 2 Katerina Siniakova, the reigning Wimbledon mixed champion, and ATP No. 1 Marcelo Arevalo would need a wild card to enter.Six of the eight wild cards have already been awarded, with Carlos Alcaraz-Emma Raducanu, Venus Williams-Reilly Opelka and Novak Djokovic-Olga Danilovic among the pairs confirmed. Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, the Roland Garros mixed doubles champions, are the only team so far made up of dedicated doubles players.Read More: Mixed doubles madness!

Adding to the strain is the schedule, which sees the mixed doubles event start on Tuesday—just one day after the Cincinnati Open's Monday final. It's a tight turnaround in a packed summer calendar that already featured the Canadian Open concluding on Thursday and Cincinnati's main draw starting the same day.“The two weeks, I feel like it's crushing a lot of the players a little bit,” Pegula said. “Obviously, yes, (they can) make more money, and our prize money may be a little bit higher and stuff like that—but it's kind of, like, at what expense?”Through to the third round in Cincinnati, No. 4 seed Pegula will face No. 31 seed Magda Linette on Tuesday.

The year's final Grand Slam announced in February that its mixed doubles competition, which will offer $1 million in prize money, would take place from August 19-20 ahead of the singles main draw the following week.

The competition's format was also overhauled to feature a field of 16 teams - half of the 32 teams that competed last year - with eight entries based on the combined singles rankings of players and eight wildcards.

Matches will be best of three sets, with short sets to four games, with no-advantage scoring, tiebreakers at four-all and a 10-point tiebreak in lieu of a third set. The final will be a best-of-three set match to six games.

The move was described by defending US Open champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori as a ""profound injustice"" to doubles players, and Pegula, who is part of the WTA Player Council, said more communication was needed between organisers and players.

""I'm honoured that they asked me to play. It's going to be great, it's going to be fun and the fans will really enjoy it,"" Pegula told reporters at the ongoing Cincinnati Open.

""At the same time, how they went about it, I didn't think was really great ... We were like, Okay, you guys went rogue and changed the format and didn't tell anybody. You just did it.

""Did you talk to the players? Did you get their input about how it could be better? That's something that we as players are trying to work with them on, having that line of communication be a lot smoother.

""I feel like maybe if there was feedback about the format, then the (reaction) would be a little different, not so all over the place.""

The US Open said previously it understood the feedback from players but stressed that the reimagined event will elevate mixed doubles with a bigger spotlight and inspire more people to play the sport.

Pegula, who will team up with fellow American Tommy Paul in the competition that also features pairs such as Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu and Jannik Sinner and Emma Navarro, said the move to limit the field could impact doubles players' earnings.

""It's not good when you have players saying they're upset that now they can't play, or that it's a way for them to make money and now they don't have that,"" Pegula added.

Jessica Pegula is excited about playing in the new US Open mixed doubles event but that doesn't mean she is perfectly fine with the changes made, as the American criticized the tournament organizers over a ""rogue"" move and urged them to next time communicate more with players before taking a drastic decision.

After it had been speculated for some time, the US Open organizers officially confirmed it in February when they revealed their completely revamped mixed doubles format. This year, a total of 16 teams will take part in a two-day event - eight teams made the tournament directly, while eight entered via a wildcard - the focus is on top singles players participating and the winning duo will take a historic $1 million prize money. 

To make sure they'd have a strong player field consisting of top ATP and WTA players, the organizers decided to schedule the doubles event for the qualifying week and that's why the event will take place between August 19-20. And they were successful in their goal since the majority of top-10 male and female stars signed up for the event.

However, it also drew a major backlash from doubles-oriented players, who ripped the US Open's move as ""disrespectful to the game."" Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori - last year's champions - declared the decision ""a profound injustice.""

""I'm honored that they asked me to play. It's going to be great, it's going to be fun and the fans will really enjoy it. At the same time, how they went about it, I didn't think was really great ... We were like, +Okay, you guys went rogue and changed the format and didn't tell anybody.' You just did it,"" Pegula said.

""Did you talk to the players? Did you get their input about how it could be better? That's something that we as players are trying to work with them on, having that line of communication be a lot smoother. I feel like maybe if there was feedback about the format, then the (reaction) would be a little different, not so all over the place.""

In the same interview, Pegula said it definitely wasn't a good look when some players started complaining that they were stripped of their job and a chance to make money.

Meanwhile, Pegula's US Open mixed doubles partner is world No. 16 Tommy Paul.

The Cincinnati Open is well underway, with the world's best players still looking for a spot in the last 16. World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has already booked his place in round four, and former finalist Carlos Alcaraz will be hoping to join him when he takes on Hamad Medjedovic.

World No. 1 and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka survived a huge scare in her own third-round match, as Emma Raducanu pushed her to the brink before losing 7-6 4-6 7-6. It was an impressive performance from Raducanu, who was told off by the umpire for communicating a little too much with her new coach, Francisco Roig, during the first set.

But the conditions have been brutal so far in Cincinnati. Cameron Norrie and Daniil Medvedev struggled with the heat over the weekend and things took a turn on Monday when Arthur Rinderknech collapsed in the middle of his match against Felix Auger-Aliassime, and retired a few games later. Play was then interrupted by a power cut, and later by a fire alarm. Express Sport will bring you the very best news, gossip and reaction from the Cincinnati Open.

Grigor Dimitrov has officially pulled out of the US Open.

The Bulgarian suffered an injury at Wimbledon and has been missing in action ever since.

The tournament organisers have confirmed today he won't take part in the competition.

Alejandro Tabilo will take the Bulgarian star's spot instead.

It brings an end to a remarkable run of 58 Grand Slam main draw appearances.



Francisco Comesana appears to be struggling with the conditions.

He's taken himself to the side of the court and currently has his head in his hands.

The umpire appeared to suggest he could be about to vomit.

A medical time-out has been called.

Alexei Popyrin digs deep to take the opening set against Andrey Rublev.

That one went the full distance!



Alexei Popyrin and Andrey Rublev are locked at 6-6 in the first set.

They're heading for a tiebreaker.

Taylor Fritz believes he and Elena Rybakina are the team to beat at the revamped US Open mixed doubles event next week.

The pair won the Indian Wells exhibition earlier this year and have more experience together than blockbuster pairings like Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz.

The ATP No. 4 told Tennis Channel: ""I really do think we're one of the favourites. We have a mixed doubles title already, and I thought we played great there. I'd love to play mixed doubles regularly if it didn't overlap with singles, but being able to play it before the week starts is amazing. I'm super excited.""



Grigor Dimitrov has pulled out of the US Open, according to the DartsRankings entry list.

The world No. 21 was forced to retire when he hurt his pectoral muscle mid-match at Wimbledon. Dimitrov was on course to pull off a huge upset when he led world No. 1 Jannik Sinner 6-3 7-5 2-2 in the fourth round.

But he suddenly went down in pain and was left in tears as he forfeited the match. It was Dimitrov's fifth successive mid-match retirement at a Grand Slam tournament.

The former world No. 3 later shared a photo on Instagram, showing himself in a hospital bed, and wrote: “Thank you for the overwhelming wave of love - from family, friends, fans, colleagues, to the entire tennis community… your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times. Thank you all. Truly. Recovery starts now. I'll see you all soon.”

He has not played a match since, and will now miss the US Open.

Frances Tiafoe will represent Team World at the Laver Cup for the sixth time in his career.

The world No. 14 joins Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, Tommy Paul, and Joao Fonseca on World's squad, which is now led by a new captain in Andre Agassi.

Tiafoe said: “There's nothing like Laver Cup. I love playing for Team World and competing alongside guys who are usually my rivals.

“We've built something special, and I can't wait to bring that same energy to San Francisco. Playing at home in front of U.S. fans means a lot – and I want to do everything I can to help us win.”



Emma Raducanu has added another event to her packed tennis schedule.

Less than 24 hours after she suffered a tight defeat to world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in Cincinnati, it was confirmed that Raducanu will make her Toray Pan Pacific Open debut this year.

The WTA 500 event in Tokyo is part of the Asian swing and runs from October 20 to 26.

World No. 4 Jessica Pegula has revealed that her former coaches and even her parents weren't happy with her attitude on the court growing up.

The American is known for her calm demeanour and rarely gets super fired up during matches. While she's commended for her cool and collected approach now, Pegula was previously told she had a ""bad attitude"".

Appearing on the Tennis Insider Club podcast, she said: ""When I was growing up, everyone always - and I say everyone is in, my parents or my coaches at the time - like never really liked my attitude. I always kind of had a bad attitude.

""And so not a bad attitude, but they'd say, you know, you look like you don't care. Passive kind of thing. And I'd be like, so then I kind of got this complex, like they were trying to get me to be fired up and I'd be like, that's okay, but like, I can't do that, so do I do it?

""So then I get mad. I think then I just started kind of being more emotional and maybe a little bit more like bad attitude.""



Jessica Pegula has struggled since lifting the title in Bad Homburg in June.

The world No. 4 suffered a shock first-round exit at Wimbledon, and then lost her opening match in Washington. As the two-time defending champion at the recent Canadian Open, she was stunned by Anastasija Sevastova, losing her first match at the tournament since 2022.

But Pegula is keen to bounce back in Cincinnati this week.

She said: I'm playing good tennis, but sometimes taking control of the momentum and those big points is something that I just haven't been able to execute coming off of Wimbledon.

""It's frustrating, but at the same time, you just keep working and trying to problem solve and figure out. What is that cue to get that back, or what is that cue to get your feet moving, your serve or return? We've just been trying to problem solve it, but at the same time, not overthink it. That's hard.

""You're trying to go out there and work on things, trying to get back to basics, and that can be a little up and down. I feel like I'm in the thick of it, but it's not the first time.""

Jack Draper is preparing to make his return at the US Open after an arm injury forced him to skip the Masters 1000 events in Canada and Cincinnati.

The British No. 1 - who has not played a match since Wimbledon - had also signed up for the new US Open mixed doubles event. After his first partner, Qinwen Zheng, was forced to withdraw after having surgery, he re-entered with Paula Badosa.

But Badosa has also pulled out, and it's not known whether Draper will attempt to play with a third teammate.

For now, he's excited to get back on the court in New York.

Draper told the LTA: “I got back to my tennis slowly to protect my arm, but it's been a really productive few weeks now. It was disappointing to miss Toronto and Cincinnati, but I think it's been a good period for me to reflect on things and improve.

“I'm really looking forward to going out to the US Open, and I'm in a great place personally and tennis-wise. I feel refreshed, motivated, and I can't wait to get back out there.”

Felix Auger-Aliassime has spoken out on the brutal conditions in Cincinnati after his opponent, Arthur Rinderknech, collapsed during their match on Monday and soon retired.

“It feels like we're in an oven, even for the fans. We're always on the move and focused on trying to win, but the crowd is sitting for a long time, and so are our coaches,” the No. 23 seed told Tennis Channel.

“A friendly reminder to everyone: drink plenty of water, bring hats, and cool off as much as possible.”



Two junior stars have already earned main draw wildcards for the upcoming US Open after claiming titles at the USTA Boys' and Girls' 18s National Championships over the weekend.

Darwin Blanch - the 17-year-old who was thrashed by Rafael Nadal at last year's Madrid Open - won the boys' title.

Meanwhile, 18-year-old Ahn, who is set to play college tennis at Stanford, won the girls' title.

Runners-up Jack Satterfield and Maya Iyengar are set to receive qualifying wildcards.

Venus Williams recently returned from a 16-month hiatus, reaching the second round in both singles and doubles in Washington. After losing her opening match in Cincinnati, she will turn her attention to the US Open, where she has entered the revamped mixed doubles event with Reilly Opelka.

But Rick Macci, an important figure in the Williams sisters' early development as tennis players who went on to coach both Venus and Serena, has suggested that Serena could also make a return in Flushing Meadows and play women's doubles with her sister.

“Asked if Serena will play doubles with Vee at the OPEN. My gut is probably because at the end of the day Serena can still play even though she has been away,” Macci tweeted.

“Her serve is still one of the best on the planet and when she competes her mindset is like granite.”



Emma Raducanu wasn't the only player with a new coach at this year's Cincinnati Open. Aryna Sabalenka recently added former doubles No. 1 Max Mirnyi to her team, and she wants him to help with her skills at the net.

The top seed beat Raducanu 7-6 4-6 7-6 in the third round on Monday and admitted that their work had already paid off.

“I was brave enough to come to the net and take risks with some shots I've been working on for the last couple of weeks,” the reigning Cincinnati champion explained.

“Max is very happy with my volley, but at the same time, he thinks it's too risky. I'm very happy with that shot. I was brave in some decisions, and I think that's why I got the win.”

The Cincinnati Open marked Emma Raducanu's first tournament with new coach Francisco Roig in her corner.

Roig spent years working with Rafael Nadal, and he had a successful post-Wimbledon trial week with Raducanu before they officially joined forces in Cincinnati.

After pushing world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in a 7-6 4-6 7-6 defeat with a vocal Roig cheering her on, Raducanu expressed some early optimism about their new partnership.

She said: I think the first week went well. I think we practised well.

""I made some improvements and I think for certain moments, you could see some stuff we practised peek through. But given that it's only been a week, I think there's been improvements.""



Former world No. 3 Stan Wawrinka, who lifted the trophy at the 2016 US Open, will hope to receive a wildcard into the upcoming tournament. For now, he's busy getting some reps in on the Challenger Tour.

Now aged 40, Wawrinka was one of the biggest threats to the Big Four's dominance during the 2010s and claimed three Grand Slam titles.

But his ranking has dropped to No. 152 in the world, and he regularly competes on the Challenger circuit to get more matches and ranking points under his belt.

The 2016 US Open champion is in action at this week's Europcar Cancun Country Club in Cancun, where he faces a qualifier in his opening match.

It's been a positive tournament for the Frenchmen in Cincinnati this year. The draw size at the Masters 1000 event has been expanded to include 96 players, and some of the lower-ranked competitors are making the most of it.

Three unseeded French players are through to the round of 16 in the men's draw.

Qualifier Adrian Mannarino stunned No. 13 seed Tommy Paul on Monday, coming back to win 5-7 6-3 6-4.

Benjamin Bonzi also mounted a comeback to beat Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(4) 6-3 6-4.

And Terence Atmane, another qualifier, took out teenage sensation Joao Fonseca 6-3 6-4.



World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka has joked that Emma Raducanu made her feel like she was ""getting old"" during their three-hour, three-set match on Monday.

Aged 27, Sabalenka is only five years older than Raducanu, but she felt the heat during her 7-6 4-6 7-6 victory and said: ""The whole time I've been thinking, this is what they call aging. I was like, ‘This is how it feels to be old.'

""I looked at Emma and she was pumped and ready to play the next point, and I was still trying to recover my breath. I looked at Jason [Stacy, her fitness coach], didn't say anything, but we need to do something because I'm getting old.""



The US Open's revamped mixed doubles event gets underway next week. Only 16 teams will get to compete over two days, with eight entries being determined by their best combined singles ranking, and the other eight teams getting wildcards.

But there has been plenty of backlash to the overhaul, especially from doubles specialists, who can no longer enter the tournament using their doubles ranking.

Jessica Pegula, who has signed up to play alongside Tommy Paul, has now claimed US Open bosses went ""rogue"" and made the changes without consulting players.

Speaking in Cincinnati, the American said: ""We were like, Okay, you guys just went rogue and changed the format and didn't tell anybody. You just kind of did it. What do you even know? Did you talk to the players? Did you get their input about how it could be better?

""I think that's just something that we as players are trying to work with them on, having that line of communication be a lot smoother.""

There was chaos at the Cincinnati Open on Monday when play was suspended for 75 minutes due to a local power outage.

Broadcast cameras suddenly cut off around 5pm local time but the matches on court initially continued as normal. But play was halted when it emerged that the tournament had been affected by a power cut.

The matches resumed shortly after 6.30pm local time, and Taylor Fritz beat Lorenzo Sonego while Benjamin Bonzi came back to beat Stefanos Tsitsipas.

There was another interruption during the night session when a fire alarm went off during Jannik Sinner's showdown with Gabriel Diallo. But after a short delay, they decided to play on.

Emma Raducanu was understandably disappointed to come out on the losing end of a three-hour and nine-minute battle with world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka on Monday. But the Brit is still proud of herself for pushing the world's best player, especially on a surface she feels less confident on.

""She's world No. 1 for a reason and I pushed her more than I did at Wimbledon so that's an improvement,"" Raducanu said, referencing her two-set loss to Sabalenka at SW19 last month.

""And also, it was good to have this result on a hard court because it's very different to grass. I was always thinking that grass suits me a lot more and I still believe that so to have pushed her on a hard court like that, I'm pretty proud of it.""



Defending champion Jannik Sinner survived a tough test against 6ft 8"" big-server Gabriel Diallo in the night session on Monday to win 6-2 7-6(6).

It was a dramatic match, briefly interrupted by a nearby fire alarm that went off in one of the court's stands, but they decided to play on after a brief delay, and Sinner saved a set point in the second set to get the job done.

But the world No. 1 admitted it was difficult to come through, and got straight back on the practice court after the match was over.

""I feel like today was a very difficult day at the office. He was serving very very well, especially in the second set. Against big servers you always have to find the right balance at the back of the court. Today I struggled a bit at times,"" he said after reaching the fourth round.

""But still very happy. I need these tough matches. Getting used to very difficult situations. I'm very happy this happened before a Grand Slam. Hopefully these situations I can keep for the main goal here in the US.""

The stars have been feeling the heat so far at this year's Cincinnati Open, but there were worrying scenes on Monday when Arthur Rinderknech collapsed at the back of the court while facing Felix Auger-Aliassime.

The Frenchman got broken to level the score at 2-2 in the second set and walked to his towel. He went to sit down but fell onto the ground, and was quickly tended to by medics.

Rinderknech played on but got broken again and retired with Auger-Aliassime leading 7-6 4-2.



Emma Raducanu made a statement during her tight, three-set defeat to Aryna Sabalenka on Monday. The Brit proved that she can stay with the world's best players for hours without dropping her level, as Sabalenka narrowly came out on top in a final set tiebreak in their third-round showdown.

But there was one moment of madness for Raducanu, who walked closer to her new coach, Francisco Roig, for a brief chat after holding for 5-4 in the first set. Roig also got out of his chair to communicate better, and the umpire called Raducanu back before telling her they weren't allowed to approach one another.

""Emma, you cannot actively approach him and he cannot leave his position. You know that. You cannot have a conversation,"" Miriam Bley said.

Raducanu protested that she couldn't hear Roig over the music, but the umpire simply suggested Roig should speak louder.

""Okay, sorry, I didn't know that. Can you tell someone to tell him? I can't say it like now,"" the British No. 1 replied.

Taylor Fritz continued to bounce back from his Toronto semi-final defeat on Monday at the Cincinnati Open, where he overcame Lorenzo Sonego and handled a mid-match power outage to reach the fourth round in Ohio for the third time.

The 27-year-old, who lost to Ben Shelton in straight sets in Canada last week, moved past the Italian 7-6(4), 7-5 in two hours and eight minutes, without facing a break point, to improve to 6-2 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

After winning a 67-minute opening set, play was suspended for about 75 minutes. Upon resumption, the second set went on serve until 5-all when Sonego missed five first serves to give Fritz the break point he needed. The American then held to love to close out his 38th tour-level victory of the season, according to Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

”I was looking for that break the entire match today,” Fritz said. “I wish I could have gotten it done in the first, when I had a couple of chances. But there's a lot of scoreboard pressure at the end of the sets, and that's where a lot of times I am finding that break.”

Fritz was down 0/30 serving at 4-5 to stay in the second set, but dug himself out of danger without facing a break point in the game, or the match. Last year's US Open finalist has not been broken in two matches this tournament and has not faced a break point since his second service game in his opening victory over American qualifier Emilio Nava. 



By advancing to the fourth round, the American has become the only player to reach at least the last 16 at all four hard-court ATP Masters 1000 events in 2025. The 27-year-old advanced to the fourth round in Indian Wells and the semi-finals in Miami and then Toronto last week.

Chasing his first Masters 1000 crown of the season and second overall, the former Indian Wells champ will meet #NextGenATP Brazilian Joao Fonseca or Frenchman Terence Atmane in the fourth round. Fritz is the first American to be among the top four seeds in Cincinnati since Andy Roddick in 2007

Now 21-4 since the start of June — a run that includes grass-court titles in Stuttgart and Eastbourne and a Wimbledon semi-final showing — Fritz is well positioned in sixth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. The American is aiming to make his second consecutive appearance at the Nitto ATP Finals, having advanced to the title match in 2024.

Fritz next plays the winner of 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals champion Joao Fonseca and French qualifier Terence Atmane.

Former World No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas's disappointing run at the four North American hard court Masters 1000s this year continued when, despite serving 14 aces, he fell to Frenchman Benjamin Bonzi 6-7(4), 6-3, 6-4.

The Greek finishes the series with just four wins across Indian Wells, Miami, Toronto and Cincinnati, where he reached three consecutive semi-finals from 2020-2022, including a run to the final three years ago. 

Bonzi next meets Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Tiafoe returns to Team World for Laver Cup San Francisco","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/tiafoe-laver-cup-2025-announcement","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 16:41:54 GMT","

Frances Tiafoe has been confirmed as the latest addition to Team World for the Laver Cup, which will take place at Chase Center in San Francisco, from 19-21 September 2025.

Tiafoe will team up with fellow Americans Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton and Tommy Paul plus #NextGenATP Brazilian Joao Fonseca, on Captain Andre Agassi's team. With one remaining spot to be announced, Team World will be looking to reclaim the Laver Cup and win on home soil against a powerful Team Europe, which features Carlos Alcaraz, Alexander Zverev, Holger Rune and Casper Ruud, with two more players to be announced.



A five-time Laver Cup competitor, Tiafoe has been a key figure for Team World since the inaugural event in Prague in 2017. He holds a 6-5 win-loss record and famously sealed Team World's first-ever Laver Cup title in London in 2022 with a dramatic victory against Stefanos Tsitsipas, having earlier partnered with Jack Sock to defeat Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in Federer's farewell match.

This season, Tiafoe was a quarter-finalist at Roland-Garros and a finalist at the ATP 250 event in Houston. He is a two-time US Open semi-finalist, reaching the final four in 2022 and 2024, the latter ending in defeat to teammate Fritz.

“Frances is a perfect fit for the Laver Cup,” said Team World Captain Agassi. “He's a big-match player, who thrives in the team environment, and is a threat in both singles and doubles. Beyond that, he brings incredible energy while on court and to our bench when supporting the team. His presence lifts everyone around him. I'm thrilled to have him on our team.”

“There's nothing like Laver Cup,” said Tiafoe. “I love playing for Team World and competing alongside guys who are usually my rivals. We've built something special, and I can't wait to bring that same energy to San Francisco. Playing at home in front of U.S. fans means a lot – and I want to do everything I can to help us win.”

Now in its eighth edition, the Laver Cup pits six of the best men's tennis players from Europe against six of their counterparts from the rest of the World in a thrilling three-day competition.

Played on a dramatic black indoor court, the competition rotates between Europe and rest of the world cities each year. Each team's six players must all compete in one singles match during the first two days, and no more than two during the three-day competition. At least four of the six players must play doubles. Each match win is worth one point on Friday, two points on Saturday, and three points on Sunday, with the first team to reach 13 points winning the Laver Cup.

The 2025 edition of Laver Cup marks the event's first appearance on the U.S. West Coast, with the state-of-the-art Chase Center, home of the seven-time NBA Champion Golden State Warriors and WNBA's Golden State Valkyries, set to host tennis for the first time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Fire Alarm: Sinner saves set point to down Diallo in Cincinnati","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-diallo-fire-alarm-cincinnati-2025","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 03:11:15 GMT","

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has seen a lot in his young career. But Monday night at the Cincinnati Open was surely a first for the World No. 1 Italian.

Play was halted in the second game of the second set in his third-round match with Gabriel Diallo when a fire alarm in the 1899 club grandstand began to sound. After a delay of several minutes, the players agreed to play through the sound and flashes, playing four points before the alarm ended. Sinner ultimately closed out the match 6-2, 7-6(6) after saving a set point with a clutch forehand service return in the tie-break.

“It was a very difficult day at the office. He was serving very well, especially in the second set… If you don't play well in tough situations like this you can lose these matches,” Sinner said.








The start of Sinner's evening match had been delayed by a late finish to Taylor Fritz's match with Lorenzo Sonego, which endured a 75-minute delay when the venue lost power.

Sinner took the first set 6-2 against the World No. 35, 6' 8” Canadian in their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting after winning six straight games from 0-2 in the first set. Diallo pushed Sinner to a tie-break on the strength of his first serve but came undone in the tie-break when he made just two of seven first serves. For the match he won just five of 32 second-serve points against the four-time major champion.

Diallo had a set point at 6-5 in the tie-break but after landing just his second first serve of the 'breaker he was unable to deal with a scorching Sinner forehand return that landed at his feet.

Sinner is on a 22-match hard-court winning streak since losing to Carlos Alcaraz in the Beijing final in October. He improved to 46-0 vs. players ranked outside Top 20 on hard courts since losing to World No. 66 Dusan Lajovic at this tournament two years ago.

Diallo, who played college tennis at the University of Kentucky, just two hours from the Lindner Family Tennis Center, home of the Cincinnati Open, fired 10 aces but also threw in a career-high 10 double faults as he perhaps tried to overplay against Sinner.

Sinner, who has reigned at No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings for 61 consecutive weeks since becoming the 29th man to rise to top spot, next plays qualifier Adrian Mannarino, who upset 13th seed Tommy Paul 5-7, 6-3, 6-4. The Frenchman entered Toronto with four tour-level wins this season, and has since earned four more.

Playing his first tournament since winning his first Wimbledon title, Sinner is 27-3 on the season, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Just 10 wins away from 300 career wins, Sinner earlier in the tournament became the second player to qualify for November's Nitto ATP Finals, where he will be the defending champion.

CINCINNATI, Ohio — As the countdown to the US Open—and its polarizing mixed doubles event—continues, Jessica Pegula says a lack of communication between players and organizers is at the heart of the divide.The American No. 4 seed spoke after her second-round victory at the Cincinnati Open on Sunday, where she defeated Kimberly Birrell 6-4, 6-3. Pegula, who will team up with Tommy Paul at the revamped two-day tournament, said players weren't consulted before the major overhaul was announced.Read More: Katerina Siniakova, doubles No. 1, on not making US Open cutoff: ""Nothing more to say""“I'm honored that they asked me to play. I think it's going to be great, I think it's going to be fun and I think the fans will really enjoy it,” Pegula told press in a mixed zone interview. “At the same time, how they went about it, I didn't think was really great.”

The US Open revealed the new format in February. The event will now take place during Fan Week over two days, with abbreviated “Fast 4” scoring. The most controversial change is the limited field of 16 teams—eight direct entries based on singles rankings, not doubles, and eight wild cards, a mix of fan favorites and doubles champions.Pegula, a member of the WTA's Player Council who co-signed a letter to the four Grand Slams calling for a greater share of profits for players, welcomed the initiative but said the lack of communication left players blindsided.Read More: US Open breathes new life into mixed doubles format with Fan Week revamp“We were like, Okay, you guys (US Open) just went rogue and changed the format and didn't tell anybody.

I think that's just something that we as players are trying to work with them on, having that line of communication be a lot smoother.“I feel like maybe if there was feedback about the format, then the (reaction) would be a little different, not so all over the place.”

“I feel like maybe if there was feedback about the format, then the (reaction) would be a little different, not so all over the place.”

Player feedback has been mixed, with many doubles specialists strongly opposed. Because of the singles ranking requirement, many top doubles players are effectively locked out—for example, doubles world No. 2 Katerina Siniakova, the reigning Wimbledon mixed champion, and ATP No. 1 Marcelo Arevalo would need a wild card to enter.Six of the eight wild cards have already been awarded, with Carlos Alcaraz-Emma Raducanu, Venus Williams-Reilly Opelka and Novak Djokovic-Olga Danilovic among the pairs confirmed. Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, the Roland Garros mixed doubles champions, are the only team so far made up of dedicated doubles players.Read More: Mixed doubles madness!

But it's not good when you have players saying that they're upset that now they can't play, or that it's a way for them to make money and now they don't have that,” Pegula said.“I think it's going to be a really fun event, but at the same time, yeah, I wish that they would have been communicating with us a little bit better.”

Adding to the strain is the schedule, which sees the mixed doubles event start on Tuesday—just one day after the Cincinnati Open's Monday final. It's a tight turnaround in a packed summer calendar that already featured the Canadian Open concluding on Thursday and Cincinnati's main draw starting the same day.“The two weeks, I feel like it's crushing a lot of the players a little bit,” Pegula said. “Obviously, yes, (they can) make more money, and our prize money may be a little bit higher and stuff like that—but it's kind of, like, at what expense?”Through to the third round in Cincinnati, No. 4 seed Pegula will face No. 31 seed Magda Linette on Tuesday.

2025 season: The story so far

It has been almost a year since Daniel Ricciardo lost his Formula 1 race seat and embarked on a new adventure outside the sport.

Daniel Ricciardo has explained how he is going through “a bit of self-exploration” after leaving the world of Formula 1, with the Australian “trying to figure out who I am” beyond racing.

Ricciardo dropped off the F1 grid following the 2024 Singapore Grand Prix, leaving him with a career total of 257 starts, three pole positions, eight victories, 32 podium finishes and more than 1,300 points.

Since then, Ricciardo has kept a relatively low profile, only occasionally making appearances at rounds of his own karting series and sharing few reflections on an F1 stint that featured time at HRT, Toro Rosso (later AlphaTauri/RB), Red Bull, Renault and McLaren.

Speaking in a rare post-F1 interview at Ray White's Connect conference in his native Australia, Ricciardo shared more on what he has been doing since walking away from the sport just under a year ago – and some of the realisations that have followed.

“Well, I haven't been shaving my face,” Ricciardo, who recently turned 36, initially joked. “The beard is my comfort right now.”

On a more serious note, he continued: “This year has been a bit of self-exploration. I lived this crazy high-speed life for so long and this year I've sat into a little bit of stillness.

“I've had a lot of time. I've done some hiking. I was in Alaska a few weeks ago and didn't get mauled by a grizzly [bear], which was a bonus.

“I've been trying to figure out who I am other than this race car driver. I've come to appreciate the little thing[s] more and the meaning of the importance of family and friends.

“I've always been driven and that sometimes leads you to being selfish, so I'm trying to learn to be a bit more selfless and become a better listener.”

With that extra time to reflect, Ricciardo took it all the way back to his very first steps in motorsport – and admitted that he still finds it difficult to believe some of the successes he went on to experience.

“[My] childhood was great,” the Perth-born racer said. “I was always driven to do something that scared me a bit.

“The reason I got into racing was because no one was really doing it. It was my chance to do something a little bit cooler than everyone else.

“I was just showing off, but showing off has got me to a really good place in life.”

He added: “Sometimes I think about things like winning Monaco and think, ‘Did that actually happen?!'.

“I always loved racing, but I never thought I'd have the career I had and make it to F1.

“You just have to take everything one step at a time. If you look too far ahead, everything looks a bit daunting.”

2025 season: The story so far

As the 2025 season takes a breather, F1.com takes a look back at the championship fight so far between McLaren team mates Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

The 2025 season has featured several fascinating storylines so far – and one of these has centred around the increasingly close intra-team championship fight that has been playing out between McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

From Round 1 in Australia through to the last race before F1's traditional summer break in Hungary, the battle has seen its fair share of changes in momentum – as well as a dramatic collision along the way.

We've been taking a look back at how the duel has unfolded throughout the first half of the campaign – with plenty more to come when the action resumes at the end of August…

When the season kicked off at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, Norris laid down an early marker by beating Piastri to pole position.

While Piastri remained on the tail of his team mate during the first half of Sunday's race, heavy rainfall in the latter stages resulted in the home hero running off the track, dropping him down the order in the process.

Throughout the hectic final stages, Norris held position to take victory by just 0.895s from Red Bull's Max Verstappen, with Piastri having to settle for ninth place.

Piastri was looking for a better outing when F1 moved on to Shanghai one week later – and while McLaren lost out to the Ferrari of Lewis Hamilton in Saturday's Sprint, Piastri grabbed pole position in Qualifying.

Despite a challenge from Mercedes' George Russell at the start, the driver from Melbourne looked in commanding form as he led throughout before claiming his first win of the season.

Norris, meanwhile, reported an issue with his brakes during the latter stages but held onto second place, giving the Woking-based squad a 1-2 finish.

Norris and Piastri dominated the top of the free practice timesheets when Formula 1 arrived at Japan's Suzuka Circuit. However, Verstappen caused a surprise by outpacing both to secure pole position.

While there was a close moment between Verstappen and Norris when both emerged from the pit exit at the same time during Sunday's race, the Dutchman remained ahead and ultimately became the third different winner in as many Grands Prix.

The final 10 laps saw Piastri close in on Norris during the battle for P2 before his challenge fell away towards the end, meaning that Norris led home his team mate in a 2-3 formation.

After the opening three races, Norris led the championship by one point from Verstappen, with Piastri 13 points adrift in third. But it was Piastri who enjoyed a stronger Qualifying at Round 4 in Bahrain, the Australian taking pole while Norris ended the session back in sixth.

From there it proved to be an impressive weekend for Piastri, who built a strong lead on race day before eventually crossing the line with a sizeable 15-second margin from Russell in P2.

Norris' good recovery drive saw him complete the podium in third, but the Briton had lost a fair bit of ground to his team mate in the championship, with Piastri having leapfrogged Verstappen to move just three points behind Norris.

After topping second and third practice in Saudi Arabia, Norris looked in promising form entering into Qualifying – but things unravelled for the Briton when a hefty crash in Q3 put him out of the session and left him down in P10 on the grid.

Piastri, meanwhile, lined up in second behind polesitter Verstappen. An early battle between the pair resulted in Verstappen being handed a five-second time penalty, dropping him behind the Australian who went on to claim a mostly untroubled win from there.

While Norris recovered to a final result of P4, Piastri's victory was enough to steal the championship lead from his team mate, making him the first Australian to head the standings in 15 years.

The Miami Grand Prix was the scene of Norris' debut win in 2024 and the British driver proved victorious at the track again during this year's Sprint, with a well-timed pit stop bringing him out ahead of Piastri.

That run did not continue into Sunday's race, however. With Verstappen taking pole ahead of Norris – and Piastri back in fourth – a mistake from Norris at the start dropped him back, while Piastri moved forwards and eventually overtook Verstappen for the lead.

Norris climbed back up to second and helped McLaren to seal another dominant 1-2, allowing Piastri to strengthen his championship lead in the process.

Piastri was again the man to beat in Qualifying for the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, the Australian clinching pole position while Norris ended the session in fourth.

It was second-placed Verstappen who starred on race day, however, with the Red Bull man making a stunning move on Piastri to take the lead on Lap 1.

The Dutchman went on to win, while Norris finished ahead of Piastri in second. This put the gap between them in the championship at 13 points.

Charles Leclerc topped the timesheets of every practice session during his home race weekend in Monaco – but Norris beat the Ferrari driver to pole position in Qualifying.

On Sunday the Briton held that position through Virtual Safety Car phases and a mandated two-stop strategy rule to claim his first Grand Prix win since the beginning of the season.

While Piastri joined him on the podium in third, the 24-year-old's championship lead had been cut to just three points.

The momentum swung back to Piastri as F1 returned to the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya for Round 9 of the season.

After beating Norris to P1 on the grid in Qualifying, the championship leader returned to the top step of the rostrum on race day.

Norris was not far behind, with the team securing another 1-2, but Piastri had eked out his title standings advantage to 10 points.

Entering into the Canadian Grand Prix weekend, Norris admitted that it was a case of “when” not “if” he and Piastri would come to blows on track during the battle for the World Championship.

Within a matter of days, that prediction had proven accurate. After a slightly weaker weekend for the squad in general, Norris was chasing down his team mate in a scrap for fourth during the closing stages of the race.

Contact occurred between them, resulting in Norris – who took responsibility for the incident – pulling off track with damage, while Piastri crossed the line in fourth. It was an incident that McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella labelled as “not acceptable”.

Off the back of that incident in Montreal, Norris appeared keen to bounce back at the next round in Austria, having set the pace in second and third practice before grabbing pole position in Qualifying, with Piastri placing in third.

What followed on Sunday was a thrilling race-long duel between the McLaren duo as they fought for the lead, Piastri remaining hot on Norris' tail throughout much of the Grand Prix.

Norris ultimately kept his team mate at bay by 2.695s to seal his third win of the campaign – and, after his non-score in Canada, the Briton was now 15 points off in the championship fight.

Verstappen again beat both McLarens to pole position at Silverstone – but a dramatic Grand Prix saw the order change.

In an eventful wet-dry race, Piastri overtook Verstappen for P1 just as rain started to fall. The Australian was later hit with a 10-second time penalty for slowing too much when preparing for a restart following a Safety Car period, handing the lead to Norris during the pit stops phase.

From there Norris claimed victory in front of his home crowd, with Piastri coming home in a slightly less happy second. His title lead had again been reduced, with the margin now down to eight points.

The Sprint spoils went to Verstappen as F1 arrived at Spa-Francorchamps for Round 13, the Dutchman having overtaken pole man Piastri in the early stages – but it was a fight between the McLaren pair when it came to Qualifying.

Norris outpaced Piastri by just 0.085s to claim pole. However, after a delay to Sunday's race due to heavy rainfall, Piastri was on the charge when racing eventually got underway and made a bold move on his team mate along the Kemmel Straight to take the lead.

While Norris went on the pursuit in the latter stages, he ultimately crossed the line just over three seconds adrift of Piastri – and, with that, the Australian had stretched his championship lead out again to 16 points.

Hungary hosted the final round of the campaign prior to the sport's traditional summer break – a venue that was also the scene of Piastri's first Grand Prix victory 12 months earlier.

Qualifying threw up a surprise result when Leclerc grabbed an unexpected pole, and the Monegasque initially led for the early stages of the race. However, while Norris had fallen away at the start, an alternative one-stop strategy put the Briton ahead of both Leclerc and Piastri as the event progressed.

Piastri went on the chase of the other McLaren during the final phase, providing a thrilling conclusion to the Grand Prix – but Norris held off his team mate to win by just 0.698s.

The impact on the championship? Norris is now only nine points away from Piastri – and, with a further 10 rounds to go when the season resumes, it looks like there is plenty more action to come in the fight for the title.

The service, Howdy, is $2.99 monthly and it's based on the idea that consumers want a Netflix add-on with no annoying commercials.


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


	 Roku is dipping its toes in the paid streaming service space, but is entering within its own new niche. 


	On Aug. 5, the company announced the launch of an ad-free streaming service, Howdy, for $2.99 a month. This makes it the cheapest major, general entertainment ad-free streaming service, far below the costs of Netflix, at $18 a month, or Hulu at $19 a month. 




	At launch, it will offer close to 10,000 hours of content from Lionsgate, Warner Bros. Discovery and FilmRise, including Mad Max: Fury Road, The Blind Side, Weeds and Kids in the Hall, alongside select Roku Original titles. That said, Howdy's content is unlikely to rival the breadth of titles and the new content offered on other services. But Roku isn't aiming to compete with them.

					Roku Delivers Stronger Than Expected Platform Revenue, Raises Outlook		
			









	“Priced at less than a cup of coffee, Howdy is ad-free and designed to complement, not compete with, premium services,” Roku founder and CEO Anthony Wood said in the Aug. 5 announcement of the new service.




			Related Video		







	The $2.99 monthly subscription comes at the right time, as the average price of ad-free plans has risen 23 percent in the past two years to $13.88, according to data firm Antenna's year-end report on the subscription landscape. Even ad-supported plans come in at a higher cost, with the average price having risen 25 percent.


	That means the service should appeal to those price conscious customers, as well as those who want to watch classic programming, but grow tired of advertising interruptions. According to market research firm Circana, among customers who cancel a streaming subscription, 24 percent do so because of the high cost. At the same time, 21 percent of individuals that are reducing their viewership or stopping their viewership of free, advertising-supported services are doing so because they say there are too many advertisements.

	











	For Roku, analysts see the move as a healthy way for the company to continue diversifying its revenue away from advertising alone and better monetize the traffic that's coming onto the platform. Roku reached more than 90 million streaming households as of January 2025. The new offering joins the platform's Roku Channel, a free, ad-supported streaming platform that was the most popular FAST service in June, according to the Nielsen Gauge. Roku also acquired subscription streaming service Frndly, a $6.99 monthly service which offers 50 live TV channels as well as video content, in May. 


	Roku's platform revenue, which includes advertising and subscription revenue, is already on a solid growth trajectory, with the company reporting revenue up 18 percent year-over-year in its most recent quarter due to the strong performance of video advertising and the acquisition of Frndly. The company included the launch of Howdy in its outlook, with platform revenue set to hit $4.075 billion, up 16 percent year-over-year. Roku is on track to be operating income positive in Q4 of 2025 and for full year 2026.


	“By adding owned and operated subscription services, Roku has an increasing number of ways to monetize the traffic it directs from its home screen: drive users to The Roku Channel (which monetizes through advertising), drive to its subscription services, Frndly and Howdy, drive to third-party apps where it may or may not take a cut of ads and/or subscription fees and drive transactional pay-per-view,” Lightshed analysts Rich Greenfield, Brandon Ross and Mark Kelley said in an Aug. 5 note. 

	











	In adding Howdy into the company's streaming services, John Buffone, vice president and media entertainment industry advisor at Circana, notes that Roku is “playing now in basically all the streaming areas.” Given the popularity of bundling among consumers, Buffone said he could also see Roku offering bundled packages of Howdy alongside Frndly, other streamers or in partnership with third-parties similar to how Walmart's subscription service includes Paramount+.


	“I think this gives them an opportunity to bundle with their company-owned services, with SVOD services that they carry on our operating system. And if they want to go beyond media, there should be a lot of activations available there as well,” Buffone said. 


	The app began automatically appearing on Roku homescreens Aug. 5, which already gives it a free, large reach, and the plan is to launch the service on mobile and other platforms in the future. The only downside for Roku with the service is not having the opportunity to place ads to direct consumers to their other services. 


	“Notably, Roku's only cost to marketing Howdy is the opportunity cost of not marketing other content that might drive a consumer to watch ad-supported content on The Roku Channel,” the Lightshed analysts said.

The superstar confirmed her upcoming 12th album during an Instagram video for the upcoming special episode of 'New Heights' on Wednesday.



		By Ethan Millman, Carly Thomas 

	August 11, 2025 9:18pm	




Taylor Swift is officially entering her next era, with the superstar announcing her latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, during a teaser for an upcoming special episode of Travis and Jason Kelce's New Heights podcast on Wednesday.


	The new album — her 12th studio effort since her 2006 debut — marks Swift's first new project since releasing The Tortured Poets Department in April 2024. Just over a year later, that album is already six-times-platinum, according to the RIAA, and it was nominated for album of the year at the 67th Grammy Awards.

	Earlier on Monday, a countdown started on Swift's official website, with it expiring at 12:12 p.m. ET. At that time, a new teaser for the upcoming New Heights episode — which will feature the pop superstar as a guest — dropped on her Instagram.


	In the clip, Swift, who is sitting next to her boyfriend Travis, tells Jason, “So I wanted to show you something.” She then whips out a mint green briefcase with her initials written in the color orange on the front. She then confesses, “This is my brand-new album, The Life of a Showgirl.”


	Jason then proceeds to yell in excitement, as Travis shouts, “TS12.”


	Swift did not share the album's release date, and the cover art was also blurred out in the teaser, leaving room for more surprises.


	The post also includes the caption,” Posted at 12:12 on the 12th. Tay's 12th album is called………… pre pre-order now at TaylorSwift.com.”

A post shared by New Heights (@newheightshow)


New Heights teased Swift's special appearance on the podcast earlier Monday, confirming a special guest online and posting an anonymous silhouette. The podcast later confirmed in a teaser on Instagram that the singer was, in fact, the special guest on Wednesday's episode.

	











	Swift has kept a low profile in 2025 compared to the past several years since she wrapped her record-breaking Eras Tour at the end of 2024. Though she made waves back in May when she announced that she'd finally secured the purchase of the rights to her early master recordings. That ended one of the most contentious disputes in music business history, which had begun when music executive Scooter Braun bought the rights to Swift's first five albums via an acquisition of her former record label Big Machine in 2019. (Braun sold her masters to Shamrock Capital a year later, with Swift making a deal with the company this year.)


	“This was a business deal to them, but I really felt like they saw it for what was to me: my memories and my sweat and my handwriting and my decades of dreams,” Swift said of the deal at the time. 


	Still, even as that controversy courted drama, Swift turned it into a lucrative chapter in her career with the “Taylor's Versions” of her original albums, which helped elevate her superstardom and, in several cases, outsold the originals.


	Like all of Swift's releases, the new album will almost assuredly be a chart monster as well, as she is perhaps the only artist left in the business who could reliably sell a million units in one week alone. (2022's Midnights debuted with over 1.5 million units sold in its first week, while last year's The Tortured Poets Department opened with a massive 2.6 million units.)

The actor stars alongside Julia Garner in director Zach Cregger's new horror mystery pic.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Josh Brolin is tired of “all the same shit” that's on streamers, so that's why he boarded Zach Cregger‘s Weapons.


	The Oscar-nominated actor recently shared with Collider how the horror mystery pic is the solution to all the boring content he said is currently offered on streaming services.




	“You're looking for great filmmakers, and you're hoping that there's another new good filmmaker out there,” he said. “Right now, with so much content, you're just watching things on whatever streaming service you're on, and you're just going, ‘Fuck, why is this so boring, man? Why?' And just go to the next thing. It's all the same shit.”

	Brolin added of Weapons, “And then somebody not only takes the horror genre, but then fucks with it and then does something on the edge of absurdity, and it's sort of humorous, so it's keeping you off-[balance] enough for him to have an emotional impact, ultimately.”

	The film, which also stars Julia Garner, follows a community in chaos after all but one child from the same class mysteriously vanishes on the same night at exactly the same time. The small town is then left questioning who or what is behind their disappearance. Weapons not only won over critics and audiences but also came in more than $10 million ahead of expectations for its opening weekend with $42.5 million.


	Cregger previously told The Hollywood Reporter that “it seems like horror is one of the few outlets for real creativity right now on a big scale.”

	











	“Without horror, you go to the theater, and you get people in tights for $200 million, and there's not a lot of room for risk in those movies. And no shade, I'm all for entertainment, entertaining. But, it's a shame that there's not a lot of room for anything else,” the Barbarian director continued. “I love horror, my creative tuning fork resonates strong with horror, so I'm lucky in that regard. I dearly wish that we could have cool, edgy weird comedies back in the movie theaters. Or dramatic fare for adults in the theater. I feel like there's not a lot of movies for grown-ups anymore.”

""People want a little more variety on their plate,"" says MacFarlane in explaining why comedy is a viable theatrical genre despite Hollywood's fears of its demise. 


							By 

	Mia Galuppo


Film Writer


The Naked Gun has been held up as a bellwether for the viability of studio comedies in the post-pandemic era, and this past weekend, the comedy reboot proved its staying power. The feature, directed by Akiva Schaffer and starring Liam Neeson, dropped just 50 percent in its sophomore outing, bringing its domestic total to $33 million, and its global haul to $56.4 million.


	Producers Seth MacFarlane and Erica Huggins hope The Naked Gun is the first of a new wave of comedies that will find theatrical audiences.




	Outside of Naked Gun, MacFarlane and Huggins-headed Fuzzy Door has a varied slate that runs the gamut from a Peacock series based on the late '80s horror-comedy The Burbs to a doc on Carl Sagan to MacFarlane's Frank Sinatra tribute album Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra. MacFarlane says, “To put it this way: You can make spark plugs and breakfast cereals at the same time, and if there's a market for both, then why not?”

					Original 'Naked Gun' Director Reacts to Reboot's Opening Weekend (Exclusive)		
			









	MacFarlane and Huggins talk to THR about the “double-edged sword” of testing comedies, what lessons Hollywood should take from Naked Gun's performance, and sequel plans.


What has the response been to Naked Gun's performance?


ERICA HUGGINS I've gotten so many incoming calls and texts and emails from well-wishers, and that doesn't always happen. (Laughs.) For the first time, you can feel the goodwill from every single producer, all the agencies, from actors, from people who just want comedy.


SETH MACFARLANE I just got a text from a retired Family Guy writer, which tells you how long the show has been on the air.  “A retired Family Guy writer.” He said he was at a barber shop at Amherst, Massachusetts. It's a six-chair place, and everybody was talking about The Naked Gun.

	











If that isn't a glowing review, I don't know what is. What was the biggest hurdle to get the greenlight on this movie?


HUGGINS The biggest thing to overcome was the question: “Will a movie like this — a spoof movie, that we haven't seen in at least a decade — work for today's audience?” Then, the next question always became, “Who is the audience? Is it nostalgia only? Is it the older crowd? How do we get the younger crowd?” And then it always came back to budget. The other big part to overcome was that we needed dramatic actors to play the comedy, and play it straight.


How did you convince the studio that Liam Neeson was the right choice?


MACFARLANE I don't know that we ever did. Eventually, they just got tired of us. There have been other iterations of this franchise attempted over the years and oftentimes it is a comedian, and usually a terrific comedian, who is announced as the lead. One of the fundamental edicts of the [original Naked Gun creators] Zucker Brothers was you played against the comedy. You cast people like Robert Stack, Peter Graves and Leslie Nielsen. There were no comics, and it just worked every single time when they stuck to that.


In the opening weekend exit numbers, nearly half the audience was in the 18 to 34 demo. What do you make of that?


HUGGINS All the previous Naked Guns were PG-13. Akiva was extremely aware of what that did for him as a kid. It allowed him access, even though it was still a little bit risqué.

	











MACFARLANE Younger audiences don't really have the same comedy filmography attached to their experience of growing up as we did. We had movies like Planes, Trains and Automobiles and Caddyshack. In the '90s, they had comedies like Home Alone and in the early 2000s 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. It's been a while since a generation has had a comedy or series of comedies that define their decade.


The marketing for this movie leaned into the reality that there haven't been broad comedies in theaters. Why do you think that played well?


MACFARLANE It was an easy choice for the studio to just dive into, because there has not been a true, hard comedy in a long time. In the '80s, you had shows like Cheers that were comedies. They had jokes, they had laughs, they were true comedies that would also be recognized during award season. You don't see that anymore. [Today] you see essentially dramas with a smattering of jokes in comedy categories. I think it was pretty easy for the studio to take that reality and say, “Hey, we know what you're looking for. Here's some water in the desert.”


How important is audience testing when it comes to releasing a comedy for modern audiences?


MACFARLANE Testing is such a double-edged sword. It is hugely valuable in the same way that it's hugely valuable to workshop your stand-up set, to know what jokes work and what don't, and to take different parts of the country and see how different audiences react. The only downside is some of the stuff that sticks in the long run, that's the stuff that's a little weirder, so it doesn't really land right away.

	











HUGGINS The things that audiences love the most and hate the most are the things that are most talked about, too. You have to be careful about not just cutting it off because you get a couple of cards that say it offends people. You want to try and find a balance.


The narrative for comedies and movie musicals is that these two genres have to constantly prove themselves every time they go into a theater.


MACFARLANE It sure is!


Heading into opening weekend, did you feel that pressure?


HUGGINS The question was, “Will a comedy work in the theaters?” Because they are so easy to access on Netflix. All the comedies now seem to be accumulating on streaming, and so it's just a different experience from laughing in a crowd. I think [it's about] re-teaching audiences to buy a ticket and go to a packed theater and see a funny movie.


MACFARLANE All the great comedies that we look at as sort of these benchmark moments in our culture and in our own lives, they're all theatrical. I can't really think of a single streaming comedy that has that kind of collective hold on the zeitgeist. Maybe they're out there and I don't know them. Streaming comedies, some of them, of course, being very good, just kind of come and go. There's a tendency to think of the theater as something that's on its way out, but I really think that's a mistake.


What lessons do you want Hollywood to take away from the performance of Naked Gun?


MACFARLANE Take risks. Make movies that aren't just reboots — wait a second. The lesson is that people want something that's outside the usual fare. We're just so deluged with superhero movies at this point that. It's like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, when he wakes up on that last morning, says, “Anything different is good.” People want a little more variety on their plate.

	











Fuzzy Door has a varied slate — from a Peacock series based on The Burbs to a doc on Carl Sagan — what are studios and streamers saying they are buying right now?


HUGGINS I haven't seen a lot of interest in buying a hard comedy. It's harder to understand what that is if you haven't done it. People want something that feels original, and then in the same breath, they want something that everybody already loves. It's about good material, regardless of the genre. We're betting on our taste.


MACFARLANE Taste is everything. There's so much examining of marketing data, which, if it was worth a damn, every movie and TV show would be a huge hit. You look at somebody like Dana Walden, who just has really good taste and just continues to succeed and succeed and succeed. At the end of the day, you have this thing called a brain, and if you're running a production company or a studio it is incumbent on you to use that brain and make decisions based on things that you think are of quality or not, marketing data be damned. People don't want a genre until they do.


Have there been talks about a Naked Gun sequel?


HUGGINS Absolutely. We've now had enough conversations among the filmmakers, and certainly with Pam [Anderson] and Liam, too, when we were selling the movie in the blue sky version of what could happen next, yes, we were thinking about where it could go and what it could be. Akiva and Dan and Doug, our writers, we're all talking about it.

The Aug. 23-24 select theatrical run is the latest milestone for the Netflix movie and soundtrack's global success. 


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


KPop Demon Hunters, the hit Netflix animated feature and soundtrack, is headed back to select theaters with a sing-along event set for screenings across North America on Aug. 23 and 24.


	The KPop Demon Hunters A Sing-Along Event will see fans of Huntrix and Saja Boys join along to sing chart-topping songs like “Golden” and “Your Idol.” Netflix is also looking to fill theaters later this month for extra revenue after the movie became a surprise hit for the streamer since debuting in June.




	The project centers on the adventures of Huntrix, a girl group comprised of three members who just happen to also fight monsters from the underworld. The movie's soundtrack also made the top 10 list for the Billboard 200 chart, with “Golden” becoming a number one hit.

The NFL star hosts the podcast with his brother, Jason Kelce.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	If you guessed Taylor Swift as the mystery guest on the upcoming episode of the New Heights podcast, give yourself a pat on the back.


	After teasing Swifties on Monday morning, the Jason- and Travis Kelce-hosted podcast confirmed the pop superstar, who is also famously dating Travis, would be making an appearance on Wednesday's episode.




	“Taylor's about to do a f*cking podcast!” the podcast captioned the episode's teaser on Instagram.


	In the clip (below), a smiling Swift also tells Travis, “Such a nice color on you.” The NFL star, who is seen wearing a blue shirt, responds, “Yes, I know. It's the color of your eyes, sweetie. It's why we match so well.”

A post shared by New Heights (@newheightshow)


	Kelce and Swift have been romantically linked since the late summer of 2023, with their relationship going public in September of that year. While fans don't know exactly how and when they got together, Swift previously confirmed that they started dating shortly after Kelce mentioned her on his New Heights podcast in July 2023. At the time, he talked about his failed attempt to give the singer a friendship bracelet with his number on it at her Kansas City Eras Tour stop.


	Since then, the “Fortnight” singer has regularly been seen attending the tight end's Kansas City Chiefs games during NFL seasons, cheering on her man from the stands with friends and family always nearby.


	Kelce also popped up at Swift's Eras Tour shows throughout its nearly two-year run to support his girlfriend, singing along to her songs in the crowd, wearing friendship bracelets and all. During one of her shows in London in 2024, the football star even made a surprise appearance onstage during a performance of “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.”

	











	After the Eras Tour wrapped in December 2024, the pair maintained a low profile as they continued to grow their connection, making occasional public appearances for date nights and events. Fans also waited for years for the couple to make their red carpet debut, and they finally did in June 2025, but in their own casual style, at the opening night ceremony for Kelce's Tight End University in Nashville.

The pop star fittingly announced her 12 studio album on Aug. 12.

	Hannah Dailey



Taylor Swift didn't rest for long after wrapping her global Eras Tour. After just eight months of downtime, the pop superstar all but broke the internet by revealing at 12:12 a.m. ET Tuesday (Aug. 12) that she'd be embarking on a brand new era with the release of an album titled The Life of a Showgirl, which will mark the 12th studio LP in her discography.


	What was almost as eye-popping as the announcement itself was the way she shared the news. In lieu of her more recent method of unveiling new albums during award-show acceptance speeches — like she did for 2022's Midnights at the VMAs and 2024's The Tortured Poets Department at the Grammys — Swift instead chose a much more casual route of spreading the word this time. Joining boyfriend Travis Kelce on his New Heights podcast, the 14-time Grammy winner simply revealed the project's existence and title in a clip posted to the show's social media accounts, just one day before the full episode's release.


	“So, I wanted to show you something,” she said in the video, pulling a blurred-out vinyl from a “T.S.” brief case as the Kansas City Chiefs tight end beamed beside her. “This is my brand new album, The Life of a Showgirl.”


	Fans are now clamoring for all the information they can get on the LP, which will mark Swift's first full-length since 17-week Billboard 200 chart-topper Tortured Poets. But while only time will tell how the famously cryptic, Easter-egg-dropping musician will continue sharing new details about Life of a Showgirl, Billboard is keeping track of all of them as they come.


	See everything there is to know — so far — about Swift's 12th studio album below.


	The title of The Life of a Showgirl was the first detail Swift revealed about the project, doing so in the New Heights clip, which was posted after a timer on her website ticked down to 12:12 a.m. ET on Aug. 12. But fans are already starting to come up with theories about what inspired the theatrical name, with some people pointing out that scenes from Gold Diggers of 1933 — a 92-year-old film about showgirls — just so happen to match the aesthetic of her Eras Tour performance of “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived.”


	Swifties have also picked up on the fact that the musician likely wrote most or all of The Life of a Showgirl while putting on her own traveling show for two years straight on the Eras trek. “Okay wait I'm already obsessed with this album concept,” one fan wrote on X. “The Life of a Showgirl potentially being about Taylor's life during the eras tour, the highest of highs and the lowest of lows, the physical and mental toll, the glitz and the glam, the celebrations, the constant travel, the longing and long distance… I am OBSESSED.”


	For months, Swifties speculated that her incorporation of more and more orange outfits in the final stages of the Eras Tour meant that the star's next album would have an orange theme — something that proved to be true when Swift finally announced The Life of a Showgirl, changing her website to have a sparkly clementine wallpaper, and updating her profile pictures on social media to show a similarly hued lock. Taylor Nation had also shared 12 images of Swift wearing orange on stage hours before the album was announced.


	A second crucial color of the new era, however, appears to be mint green — and fans think they might have already figured out what it represents. “The colour scheme is copper oxidizing because a showgirl is on a pedestal for the world and over time, in the public eye they lose their shine…,” one person wrote on X, using the Statue of Liberty's fade from bronze to green over time as an example.


	After working almost exclusively with Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner for about eight years, Swift appears to have reunited with producer Max Martin for The Life of a Showgirl. At least, that's what fans have gathered from the mysterious Spotify playlist Swift personally curated for the new era — titled “And baby, that's show business for you” — that includes only songs she made with the elusive Swedish pop pioneer.


	The premise of Martin's involvement is definitely exciting, as he helped Swift craft some of her biggest hits to date. Their previous collaborations include “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” “Blank Space” and “Shake It Off,” each of which spent multiple weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Taylor Swift‘s mysterious countdown timer has come to an end, with the pop icon sharing the announcement of her new album, The Life of a Showgirl.


	Speculation of a new era from Swift began on Monday (Aug. 11) when rumors of her 12th studio album were stoked thanks to the appearance of a countdown clock on her official website. 


	The countdown officially ended at 12:12 a.m. ET, on Aug. 12, with Swift's store going live with pre-orders for a new project titled The Life of a Showgirl.

	Currently, specifics of the forthcoming album are sparse. The webstore offers pre-orders for vinyl, CD and cassette editions, while noting that its official release date is still to be announced, with physical items set to ship ahead of Oct. 13.

	Additionally, the artwork utilized in the online mock-ups (a mint green background with a glittery, burnt-orange padlock) is described as being “a blurred digital rendering for pre-order purposes only,” with full artwork and specifications to be announced later.


	On Monday morning, New Heights — the podcast hosted by Swift's boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother, fellow NFL star Jason Kelce — teased “a VERY special guest” for their new episode on Wednesday, with a social teaser suggesting that Swift would be making an appearance on the show. 


	Swift's upcoming presence was later confirmed, with her cameo on New Heights set to premiere at 7 p.m. ET on Wednesday (Aug. 13).

	











	In a clip shared to both Swift and New Heights‘ Instagram accounts alongside the announcement, the pop icon gives fans confirmation that the new project is indeed the #TS12 news they've been waiting for.


	“So I wanted to show you something,” Swift says, before presenting a blurred-out copy of her new record. “This is my brand new album, The Life of a Showgirl.” The album's full artwork is expected to arrive during the New Heights podcast on Wednesday.


	Swift's 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, was released in April 2024 and scored the biggest Billboard 200 debut of her career. The album had 17 nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 — a new record for Swift — and received a Grammy nod for album of the year. It was her seventh nomination in that marquee Grammy category, a record among female artists.


	The superstar has been relatively quiet since her record-breaking Eras tour wrapped up last December, although the May news that she successfully bought back the master recordings of her first six studio albums did prompt a streaming resurgence for those projects, as well as her entire catalog.

Plus, Chappell Roan's ""The Subway"" rumbles in at a career-best No. 3.

	Gary Trust



HUNTR/X's “Golden” goes up, up, up a spot for its first week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.


	The aspirational song is from the soundtrack to the smash animated Netflix film KPop Demon Hunters and glows as the first Hot 100 leader for the act, whose music is voiced by EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI. The set rules Billboard's Soundtracks chart for a seventh week.


	Notably, “Golden” is the ninth song associated with Korean pop to conquer the Hot 100 — and the first by female lead vocalists. It joins “Seven” by Jung Kook (featuring Latto) and “Like Crazy” by Jimin, both of BTS, in 2023, and BTS' six No. 1s in 2020-21: “Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat),” with Jawsh 685 and Jason Derulo; “Dynamite”; “Life Goes On”; “Butter”; “Permission To Dance”; and “My Universe,” with Coldplay. (HUNTR/X singers EJAE and REI AMI were born in Seoul, South Korea; Nuna is from New Jersey.)


	“Golden” is also the first IRL Hot 100 No. 1 by any act with a fictional background since the ensemble No. 1 “We Don't Talk About Bruno,” which reigned for five weeks in February-March 2022. It, too, was released from a hit animated film, Disney's Encanto, and sung by multiple vocalists as their characters in the movie.


	As for all-women collectives of three or more members, HUNTR/X is the first to top the Hot 100 in 24 years — since Destiny's Child dominated with “Bootylicious” for two weeks in August 2001.


	Plus, Chappell Roan's “The Subway” pulls into the Hot 100 at No. 3, marking her highest debut and rank. The song starts as her fourth top 10.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Aug. 16, 2025) will update on Billboard.com Tuesday, Aug. 12. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Golden,” on Visva/Republic Records, tallied 31.7 million official streams (up 9% week-over-week), 8.4 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 71%) and 7,000 sold (up 35%) in the United States Aug. 1-7.


	The track slays for a third week at No. 1 on Streaming Songs and rises 5-3 for a new best on Digital Song Sales. It makes history in the former metric, as it's the Hot 100's greatest gainer in streaming for a record-breaking sixth straight week. (It surpasses the five weekly wins in a row for Migos' “Bad and Boujee,” featuring Lil Uzi Vert, in early 2017.) “Golden” debuted at No. 81 on the July 5 chart and began its streak the following week.


	Plus, “Golden” is the first non-debuting title to clear 30 million weekly official U.S. streams since Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” in late March. (In between, two songs reached the mark in their first chart weeks: Playboi Carti's “Evil J0rdan” and Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae.)


	Flying colors: “Golden” is the fourth Hot 100 No. 1 with “gold” or “golden” in its title to shine atop the Hot 100.


	Here are all the glittering “gold” records:


	Honorable mentions (silver medals?): 24kGoldn sparkled with “Mood,” featuring iann dior, for eight weeks at No. 1 in 2020-21, and Bobby Goldsboro led with “Honey” for five weeks in 1968.


	(While no songs with “silver” in their names have led topped the Hot 100, “Fly, Robin, Fly” by Silver Convention did for three weeks in 1975.)


	Chappell Roan's “The Subway” rolls into the Hot 100 at No. 3, marking the singer-songwriter's highest career debut and rank as she earns her fourth top 10. All four have hit the top five: “Good Luck, Babe!” and “Pink Pony Club” each rose to No. 4 last September and this April, respectively, and “The Giver” entered at its No. 5 peak in March.


	“The Subway” tallied 25.1 million streams, 787,000 in airplay audience and 6,000 sold in its first full week of tracking (no pun intended), following its July 31 release as a recording. Chappell Roan premiered the song live during her Governors Ball set on June 7, 2024, and built buzz for it by playing it regularly in concert since.


	(The song becomes the highest charting Hot 100 hit with “subway” in its title. Petula Clark rode her classic “Don't Sleep in the Subway” to No. 5 in July 1967.)


	Alex Warren's “Ordinary” drops to No. 2 on the Hot 100 after nine nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in June. It claims an eighth week at No. 1 on Radio Songs (73.6 million, essentially even) and an 11th week atop the Songs of the Summer chart, having led each week since the survey made its seasonal return after Memorial Day.


	Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, dips 3-4 on the Hot 100 after it debuted in May as Wallen's fourth No. 1 and McRae's first. It posts a 12th week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.


	Justin Bieber's No. 2-peaking “Daisies” falls 4-5 on the Hot 100, two weeks after it debuted at its No. 2 high. It's the chart's top gainer in airplay for a second week (20.9 million, up 23%).


	Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” is steady at its No. 6 Hot 100 best, and Wallen's “Just in Case” descends 5-7 after reaching No. 2.


	Saja Boys, HUNTR/X's targets in KPop Demon Hunters, climb 9-8 for a new Hot 100 high with “Your Idol.”


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024 and closed as the year's No. 1 song, backtracks 7-9 as it adds a record-extending 103rd week on the chart overall and a record-boosting 73rd week in the top 10.


	Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” stumbles 8-10, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning in July 2024.

The countdown ends in a few hours, at… 12:12 a.m. ET, on Aug . 12. (See the countdown here.)

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


	The blast radius of Carl Rinsch‘s extravagant spending habits and Netflix‘s impetuous handing out of millions in the Golden Age of Streaming now has the feds footing the bills.


	A month before the 47 Ronin director's fraud and money laundering trial over allegedly scamming the Ted Sarandos– and Greg Peters-run streamer out of $11 million and more was initially scheduled to start in New York City, looks like the once high-living Rinsch truly is dead broke – as he claimed when he was arrested in March in Los Angeles.


	In fact, out on a $100,000 bond posted quickly after the Department of Justice indictment came down, the “no income” filmmaker behind the never completed and hugely over-budget android drama series White Horse/Conquest is totally skint. The 47-year-old Rinsch is so broke, say his public defender lawyers, that he can't afford to get himself from L.A. to the Big Apple for a pre-trial court appearance next week.

	











	And a federal judge is A-Okay with that. 


	“Ordered that the United States Marshals Service arrange for Mr. Rinsch's means of noncustodial transportation from Los Angeles, California to New York, New York, or furnish the fare for such transportation for Mr. Rinsch's court appearance, scheduled for August 19, 2025 at 4 PM,” wrote District Judge Jed Rakoff on Monday after receiving a request from the director's publicly provided attorney. “It is hereby ordered that it should be arranged for Mr. Rinsch to arrive in New York by the evening of August, 18, 2025; and it is hereby further ordered that the aforesaid expenses shall be paid for by the United States Marshals Service.”

	











	Facing decades behind bars if found guilty on multiple charges, Rinsch was originally set to go on trial September 8. That date has now been kicked down the calendar to December 2 at 9:30 a.m. ET in the federal courthouse at 500 Pearl Street. No witness list has been produced yet, but you can be sure ex-Netflix exec Cindy Holland, and maybe even Sarandos and 47 Ronin star Keanu Reeves, are in the running to potentially testify.


	Given the seal of approval by Reeves, Rinsch was given $61 million by now-Paramount streaming chief Holland when she deftly snagged White Horse, later renamed Conquest, out of Amazon's paws in 2018. Burning through $44 million for the project with little to show for it but holding final-cut power, Rinsch insisted in 2020 he needed another $11 million for various and pre- and post-production needs to complete the series. Netflix gave it to him.


	Well, as Billy Preston once said, “nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin',” and despite telling Netflix that everything was “awesome and moving forward really well” on the project, Rinsch is accused of going on a spending spree of cars, crypto, lawyers (to sue Netflix), fancy watches, fun and more.


	A year or so later, with Rinsch living large but almost busted again, the streamer took Rinsch to arbitration to get its money back.


	Securing a $12 million award, Netflix won that round, after the filmmaker claimed the company actually owed him $14 million. However, a poverty-declaring Rinsch hasn't paid them a penny, and the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York (which hasn't had the best year between Donald Trump's vengeance and face-planting in its sex-trafficking prosecution of Sean “Diddy” Combs) came a knockin' a few months ago – -which brings us to now.


	Assuming that Rinsch, who has pleaded not guilty, isn't flying Con Air or Amtracking or Greyhounding it, air travel is actually pretty reasonable, even with less than a week left to make the trip.


	Currently, with a peek on Expedia, there is a one-way and non-stop 8:47 p.m. PT flight in economy on August 18 from LAX to JFK on Frontier Airlines for $245 before taxes and fees. That flight gets into NYC at 5:30 a.m. ET, so Rinsch would have  time before having to show up at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Courthouse in the afternoon. Alternatively, there is a 9:15 a.m. PT one-way flight on Delta for $459 that would get Rinsch into JFK at around 6:25 p.m. ET on August 18.


	When you make this a return flight with Rinsch going back to Los Angeles on August 20, the prices go up to around $600 at the low end. Of course, this doesn't take into consideration the fact that the defendant will likely need a hotel, which is never cheap or easy to get in New York in the middle of August.


	Still, in this age of deep federal budget cuts and agencies being slashed by the Trump administration, even the idea of a one-time multimillionaire (at least on paper) Hollywood director getting government handouts might just rub some the wrong way.


	Just maybe.

I'm in the minority but I personally like 47 Ronin.  But the thing is…that movie went way over budget, it's release date was moved back multiple times, and Universal finally had to fire CR during post production because they didn't think he would ever finish the movie.  All of this was widely reported….so giving the writer/director a huge sum of money with no supervision sounds like business malpractice.  Shareholders should be suing the Netflix execs who gave him the money and didn't monitor the progress of what he was making rather than Netflix suing him.  Netflix execs are shirking responsibility for their own actions.

None of this adds up. How the hell would any director just be given $64 million dollars for a movie and not have a single producer following along to make sure things were going according to plan? Did they start filming? Was anyone seeing dailies? Were actors hired? Were their dept heads on set? WAS there a set?! Like, was the movie shot but he just ran over budget because he was spending the budget on himself the side?
This article makes it out like Rinsch was given millions, spent it all, and didn't actually shoot the movie at all. This article also fails to mention that taxpayer dollars partly fund the United States Marshal Service's budget. So, WE the People, are partially paying for this grifter's flight and hotel and food to/from NYC.

He directed one studio movie with budget issues, that he was nearly fired from, that failed at the box office…

…and he was given free reign over the budget here? Where was the oversight by Netflix? Who and where were the producers? How did he even access that much money without anyone knowing? I rep directors and can't even figure how this happened. He may be a fraudster but he was enabled by a shocking lack of oversight for someone with his history.

He was Ridley Scott's son in law, and they thought he was the second coming of Ridley.

I've been working in this business for over 30 years and one thing has remained the same:   Buyers watch money like a hawk.   How could this even happen?   Who was asleep at the wheel at Netflix?!??

	“It's easy to talk about forgiveness and mercy when it's not your loss.” So begins a new trailer for Task, HBO‘s upcoming drama series from Mare of Easttown creator Brad Ingelsby. The seven-episode series premieres Sunday, Sept. 7 at 9 pm on HBO and will stream next day on HBO Max.


	Set to Pink Floyd's “Wish You Were Here”, the trailer sees Mark Ruffalo‘s Tom, an FBI agent in action as he's put in charge of a task force to find the perpetrators of a string of violent home invasion robberies led by an unsuspecting family man (Tom Pelphrey). 


	“I'm gonna take their money so we can have a better life,” says Pelphrey's Robbie.  ‘When we're too deep into something, we just can't see what others see,” he adds.

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Stavros Halkias, a buzzy comedian recently making his way into acting with projects like Yorgos Lanthimos' Bugonia and indie comedy Let's Start a Cult, has come aboard for a role in Tony, the forthcoming Anthony Bourdain biopic from A24, Star Thrower and Zapruder Films, which has wrapped production.


	Character details are under wraps. As previously announced, The Holdovers breakout Dominic Sessa leads the cast, which also includes Antonio Banderas, Emilia Jones, and Leo Woodall.


	While pic's logline is under wraps, sources say the film takes place during the summer of 1976, when a young Anthony Bourdain has a life-changing summer in Provincetown.

	











BlackBerry helmer Matt Johnson is directing from a script by Todd Bartels and Lou Howe. A24 is producing with Tim and Trevor White under their Star Thrower (The Post, King Richard) banner, along with Johnson and Matthew Miller through their Zapruder Films. Exec producers include Chris Stinson, Amy Greene, Lou Howe, Todd Bartels and Emily Rose, as well as Kimberly Witherspoon, who reps Bourdain's estate.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Viewed by comedy insiders as one of the comics you'll see break out as a star in film and TV, Halkias has in recent years been courted by a number of top-tier filmmakers, including Lanthimos (with Bugonia, premiering in Venice later this month) and Steven Soderbergh (with the recent sci-fi web series Command Z). He built his following with specials like the self-released Live at the Lodge Room, which reached a million views on YouTube in its first four days and currently sits at over 7M, and Netflix's Fat Rascal, as well as podcasts like the hugely popular Cum Town, which ran from 2016-2022. Most recently, he wrote, produced and starred in indie comedy Let's Start a Cult, also starring opposite Shane Gillis in Season 2 of Netflix's Tires.


	Currently on the international leg of his The Dreamboat Tour, Halkias at the same time hosts the podcast Stavvy's World, which debuted at #3 on the iTunes comedy charts and garnered hundreds of thousands of subscribers in its first year. He is represented by UTA.

SEO Staff Writer


Taylor Swift has returned from her post-Eras tour hiatus with the announcement of her twelfth album, The Life of a Showgirl.


	The official release date has not yet been revealed, but the pre-order vinyls or cassette tapes will ship before October 13, according to Swift's website.


	The vinyl is a glittery orange color with a green sleeve over it. The mint green cover has the cutout of a lock symbol over the disc. Not many more details are available at this time, but the album artwork is to be revealed at a later date


	The songstress had a glittery orange background up on her website counting down to 12:12 ET or 9:12 PT. At 9 p.m. ET and 7 p.m. PT, Travis and Jason Kelce's New Heights podcast announced that Swift would, indeed, be the special guest on Wednesday's new episode, which drops at 7 p.m. ET. Fans had been speculating, some even going so far as to photoshop a picture of Swift into the mystery guest silhouette cutout on the promo shot for the episode.

	“Yesss, I know. It's the color of your eyes, sweetie,” Kelce said in reply to Swift. “It's why we match so well.”

	











	Then Swift excitedly says “We're about to do a f*cking podcast!”

Taylor Swift weilds a power unlike any other. Only she can direct the world's superpowers to stop throwing sandwiches at federal agents and head to the nearest internet-enabled device to log onto www.taylorswift.com. Earlier today, Ms. Swift, showing off her terrifying ability to control humans en masse, turned her entire website into a mysterious countdown clock. Set for 12:12 A.M. E.S.T., Swift primed her faithful legion for a grand proclamation. What was so vital that she shut down Swift central to replace it with an orange glitter background? Was it a podcast? A new album? Well, if you were on the website at the time of expiration, it was to announce “504 Gateway Time-out.” Then, after several more refreshes, we had our answer: Taylor Swift's 12th studio album, The Life Of A Showgirl, is ready for preorder.

She also brought the album to her boyfriend's podcast, New Heights. In a clip posted to X, a website currently courting a lawsuit from Swift—why they still do business with that website is beyond us—Swift brought the album to show to Travis and Jason Kelce. The new episode of New Heights, which supposedly features Swift discussing the record, releases on Wednesday at 7 P.M. E.S.T.

Preorders are now up for each of the three forms that the Life Of A Showgirl shall assume. For $29.99, one can procure a vinyl copy of Showgirl, or for $19.99, one can buy the cassette, making it, by far, the most expensive cassette sold since 1987. Finally, a $12.99 CD and poster combo is available for the thriftiest members of her audience, and the ones in need of the most pristine audio fidelity.

However, the album still lacks cover art, track listing, and an official release date—no one knows how to drag out an album cycle quite like Swift. The album will ship before October 13, but the site notes that “this is not the release date, official release date to be announced.” Again, no one else knows how to wring every drop of marketing potential out of what will surely be a blockbuster album like her.

So say goodbye to The Tortured Poets Department because a new era begins with Showgirl. And to paraphrase a different showgirl, the great Nomi Malone, let's hope it doesn't suck.

The Internet Archive is an internet essential, a proverbial treasure trove of digital delights from yesteryear that keeps the web free and open to everyone. Unfortunately, the Internet Archive's mission to make the internet as large, useful, and enlightening as possible is in direct conflict with that of AI companies. Although artificial intelligence has made significant strides in making the internet smaller and more cluttered with SPAM, it has also destroyed formerly useful sites ostensibly to increase profits that have yet to materialize. They're not even making money on this shit, and yet, it's driving a wave of ChatGPT-induced psychosis and endless servings of slop. But cooking up all that slop requires massive amounts of data, and to get it, AI has to steal. Disney and Universal are currently suing the “bottomless pit of plagiarism” that is Midjourney AI. But, in an effort to stop AI crawlers from hoovering up user data for even more sycophantic chatbots, Reddit is now limiting the Internet Archive because those scrapers are feeding off the Reddit data stored on there.

Per The Verge, Reddit is limiting the amount of archiving the Wayback Machine can do. The Wayback Machine will still index Reddit's homepage, allowing it to archive the day's most popular posts. However, previously, the Internet Archive's Machine allowed users to visit and store entire Reddit posts, conversations, and user pages. “Internet Archive provides a service to the open web, but we've been made aware of instances where AI companies violate platform policies, including ours, and scrape data from the Wayback Machine,” Reddit spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt said. “Until they're able to defend their site and comply with platform policies (e.g., respecting user privacy, re: deleting removed content) we're limiting some of their access to Reddit data to protect redditors.” For what it's worth, Mark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine, assured The Verge that the two websites have a “longstanding relationship” and that “ongoing discussions” will continue.

The Verge notes that not all scrapers are created equal to Reddit. The company made a deal with OpenAI and Google last year. Presumably because Google wanted to prevent Googlers from adding “site: Reddit.com” to search queries and keep them on its decaying search engine. Meanwhile, Reddit sued Anthropic in June for scraping its site. Additionally, the site has informed other search engines that they would need to pay to access the millions of pieces of information written for free by Redditors. Not that Reddit's going to pass the money on to users who are doing the labor of keeping these search engines and AI models fed. In the end, the system has made interns of us all.

Angelina Jolie is on the brink of making some major life changes at 50. The Academy Award winner is ready to let go of her treasured Los Angeles estate, which could take her far from the city she has called home for decades.

As per a report in People published on 11th August, Jolie has “put the house up for sale” as she explores a move abroad. Page Six was the first outlet to break the news.

Jolie “never wanted to live in L.A. full time,” the source explains. “She didn't have a choice because of the custody arrangement with Brad.” 

The “Maria” actress shares six children with ex-husband Brad Pitt: Maddox, 24, Pax, 21, Zahara, 20, Shiloh, 19, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 17.

The source says Jolie “plans to relocate as soon as Knox and Viv turn 18 next year. She's eyeing several locations abroad. She'll be very happy when she's able to leave Los Angeles.”

Another insider confirms that the “Without Blood” writer-director will sell the home after making minor improvements. Jolie bought the 1913-built property in 2017 for $24.5 million. Spanning 11,000 square feet, the estate features six bedrooms, ten bathrooms, and sweeping historic charm. See more photos of Jolie's estate here.

A post shared by Celebrity Real Estate (@housesofcelebs)

Jolie's home holds a special place in Hollywood history. Director Cecil B. DeMille purchased it in 1916 for under $28,000. 

A post shared by Houses (@houses)

Years later, he acquired and combined it with a neighboring property once owned by Charlie Chaplin. “It's a historic masterpiece and truly such a beautiful estate,” the source notes.

Jolie has been open about her desire to live abroad. In a 2024 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, she shared that she remains in Los Angeles “because I have to be here from a divorce.” 

She added, “When you have a big family, you want them to have privacy, peace, safety. I have a house now to raise my children, but sometimes this place can be … that humanity that I found across the world is not what I grew up with here.”

Once her twins turn 18, she plans to spend “a lot of time in Cambodia,” where she adopted Maddox in 2002. “I'll spend time visiting my family members wherever they may be in the world,” she said. Cambodia, she added, is the one place “in my heart” she considers her true home.

As her ex-husband Brad Pitt moves forward, Jolie is also embracing a fresh chapter filled with new possibilities.

Brandon Blackstock, the former husband of Kelly Clarkson, traded Hollywood for the quiet expanse of Montana in the years before his death at 48. The onetime music manager left Los Angeles behind to live as a rancher and rodeo founder, building a new life on a sprawling $1.8 million property while privately battling cancer.

According to real estate records obtained by the US Sun, Blackstock bought his four-bedroom, three-bath ranch in Butte, Montana, in April 2022 for $1.8 million. The home sits on more than 41 acres and was described by listing agents as “very private and serene.” It features massive ceilings, panoramic mountain views, and open spaces ideal for livestock operations.

From the property, Blackstock ran his companies — V Bar V Cattle Co. and Valley View Livestock — and also founded Valley View Rodeo in Bozeman. The wide-open setting allowed him to step away from the high-pressure entertainment world and immerse himself in ranch work.

In the weeks before his death, his eldest daughter, Savannah, 23, visited the ranch and shared candid family photos online. Blackstock was also father to River, 11, and Remington, 9, with Clarkson, and to Savannah and Seth from his first marriage to Melissa Ashworth. He was a grandfather to Savannah's son and had another grandchild on the way.

A post shared by Shelby Blackstock (@shelbyblackstock)

Before his retreat to Montana, Blackstock had a high-profile career in the music industry. Working alongside his father, Narvel Blackstock, he managed artists including Blake Shelton and produced for “The Kelly Clarkson Show.” He was also the former stepson of country icon Reba McEntire, maintaining a close relationship with her after her 2015 divorce from Narvel.

Clarkson filed for divorce in June 2020, with the split finalized two years later following disputes over property — including her $10 million “Vintage Valley” ranch. After she won the property in court, Blackstock moved to his own Butte ranch.

Blackstock's cancer diagnosis remained private until his death on August 7. His family confirmed the news in a statement to CNN:

“It is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family. We thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family's privacy during this very difficult time.”

TMZ reported he was fighting melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer, and Page Six noted that he was in hospice care before his passing. A source told Page Six, “It's been exhausting and so sad. Kelly has been working so hard, as well as looking after Brandon. Despite their difficult divorce, he's still the man she loved and still her kids' father.”

Just one day before his death, Clarkson canceled her Las Vegas residency dates to be with their children. “While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them,” she told fans.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Mark Zuckerberg Drops $110 Million on Interesting Purchase","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-110-million-private-compound/","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 15:14:23 GMT","

Mark Zuckerberg has invested more than $110 million in creating an expansive private compound in Palo Alto's Crescent Park neighborhood, systematically acquiring at least 11 properties over the past 14 years to build a secure family estate for himself, wife Priscilla Chan, and their three daughters.

The Meta CEO's real estate strategy began in 2011 with the purchase of a 5,600-square-foot home on Edgewood Drive and has evolved into a comprehensive neighborhood transformation that includes multiple residences, recreational facilities, and enhanced security measures throughout the area.

Zuckerberg has converted five of his acquired homes into an interconnected compound that serves as the family's main residence, according to the New York Times. The property features guest homes, professionally landscaped gardens, a pickleball court, and a pool equipped with a hydrofloor covering that can transform the swimming area for various uses.

One particularly notable addition to the compound is a seven-foot silver statue of Chan that Zuckerberg commissioned, which stands prominently on the property. The estate also includes 7,000 square feet of underground space that building permits classify as basements, though neighbors have dubbed these areas “bunkers” or “the billionaire bat cave,” according to the outlet.

The purchases have been strategically made through limited liability companies with nature-themed names such as Pine Burrow and Seed Breeze, often requiring sellers to sign nondisclosure agreements. Zuckerberg has frequently offered well above market value, sometimes paying double or triple a property's worth to secure the acquisitions.

Several of the purchased properties serve different functions within the broader estate. One building operates as an entertainment venue and staging area for outdoor events, while another controversial property functions as a private school for 14 children, despite city zoning codes prohibiting such use in residential areas.

The extensive compound has necessitated significant security measures given Zuckerberg's high-profile status as Meta's CEO. Aaron McLear, a spokesman for the couple, explained that Meta requires heavy security for its chief executive due to specific, credible threats. The security infrastructure includes cameras positioned throughout the properties and private security guards stationed in vehicles throughout the neighborhood.

“Mark, Priscilla and their children have made Palo Alto their home for more than a decade,” McLear told the New York Times. “They value being members of the community and have taken a number of steps above and beyond any local requirements to avoid disruption in the neighborhood.”

Despite these assurances, some neighbors have expressed concerns about the changes to their community. Michael Kieschnick, whose Hamilton Avenue home is bordered on three sides by Zuckerberg-owned properties, shared his perspective with the publication.

“No neighborhood wants to be occupied,” Kieschnick said. “But that's exactly what they've done. They've occupied our neighborhood.”

The couple has made several accommodations to address neighbor concerns. Security personnel now use quiet electric vehicles instead of gas-powered cars, and staff members regularly provide advance notice of potentially disruptive events along with contact information for reporting any issues.

Additionally, Zuckerberg's team has sent thoughtful gifts to neighbors during particularly active construction periods, including sparkling wine, chocolates, Krispy Kreme doughnuts, and even noise-canceling headphones to help with construction noise.

The Palo Alto compound represents just one part of Zuckerberg's broader real estate portfolio, which includes 2,300 acres on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, a developing compound at Lake Tahoe, and a recently purchased $23 million mansion in Washington, D.C.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Luke Bryan Won't Perform on Fridays & You'll Love His Reason","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/luke-bryan-friday-concert-rule/","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 13:25:01 GMT","

Luke Bryan is well known for his devotion to his fans, going to great lengths and even risking injury to put on a great show for them.

But there's one thing the “American Idol” judge won't do. And that's give them his Fridays!

And he has a great reason for that.

The “A Country Song Came On” singer co-hosted Country Countdown USA August 9 and 10. While on the show, he told host Lou Helton that the reason is his sons, Bo (17) and Tate (14.)

“Bo is playing high school football,” Luke revealed. “I try to take every Friday off so I can see him play.  Tate is playing golf too.  Bo has been driving, so we don't see him as much any more.  I don't know what we're going to do when he goes off to college.”

A post shared by Luke Bryan Official (@lukebryan)

Luke Bryan also had good things to report about his health.

The singer dealt with a bout of COVID that caused him to offer fans at one concert a full refund, then postpone two tour stops and three festival appearances.

But now Bryan says he's fully recovered. “I'm 100%. I got knocked back pretty good in mid-June and early July. I think fans were concerned about me. I was doing everything I could. You can only take so much medication.  But all well. Feeling good,” he said on Country Countdown USA.

Luke has admitted that it was hard for him to cancel shows. 

On “Taste of Country Nights,”  he said he realized fans would be asking, “What is wrong with him?” when they heard his voice. “Fans could see me really coughing hard onstage, and man, I was on every medicine trying to make myself better.”

“You know, that's the really frustrating part, I want to be onstage at a hundred percent every night of my life, but that's not really reality,” he admitted.

A post shared by ▫Bailey Zimmerman▫ (@bailey.zimmerman)

Luke Bryan is also passing on some of his hard-fought wisdom to country music's next generation.

He told Country Countdown USA host Lou Helton he has recently given advice to both Bailey Zimmerman and Ella Langley.

 Luke told the host, “When I was his age, people didn't shoot video of everything.  I told him, ‘Learn, be better, and you're human.' Then we did a song together, He said, ‘Yeah, let's do it!' He's being Bailey.  When he walked out, the fans lost it.  We got him in, and we got him outta there.” 

His advice for Ella Langley, who just announced she's taking a few weeks off from performing to focus on her health, is to focus on the excitement of her career skyrocketing.

“It so exciting to be on the cusp of your dreams coming true. She's becoming a celebrity,” Luke told Helton. “It's really fun. She has the right tools. I introduced her to the music of KT Oslin. I told her, ‘You need to listen to KT Oslin.'  It's so great, with her & Lainey [Wilson], we've got girls now with country accents.”

Princess Diana's approach to food was famously disciplined, but her former chef says the Princess of Wales made one notable exception when her sons were around. 

Darren McGrady, who spent 11 years cooking for Queen Elizabeth II before joining Diana at Kensington Palace in 1993, revealed the surprising dish that appeared on the menu only when Princes William and Harry were at the table.

A post shared by Lady Diana, Princess of Wales (@lady.diana._)

As reported by InStyle, McGrady said Diana's day-to-day meals reflected a clean, light style. “She never ate pork,” he said. “Occasionally, she'd have lamb when she was entertaining guests, but for the most part it was chicken, fish, or vegetarian options.” 

He added that the beloved princess “was into healthy eating, so we never had beef on the menu unless the boys were home.”

Moving from Buckingham Palace to Kensington meant reworking his cooking. “When I was cooking for her [Diana], I had to change my style of cooking,” he said. “I had to move from cooking food for the Queen—heavy sauces, rich sauces and creams—to start cooking lighter food again, cutting out the fats, cutting out the carbs.” 

According to McGrady, Diana was clear about the plan: “She would say, ‘You take care of all the fats, and I'll take care of all the carbs at the gym.' So dishes like tomato mousse, which she really liked, she'd say, ‘Make me a fat-free version.'”

A post shared by Lady Diana, Princess of Wales (@lady.diana._)

The royal chef further revealed that the palace menu often shifted toward “nursery-friendly” comfort food when William and Harry were home from boarding school. 

It changed from Princess Diana's healthy eating—stuffed peppers, eggplant, vegetarian dishes—to nursery food,” McGrady said. “Wills and Harry loved cottage pie, pizza, chicken nuggets, French fries, potato wedges, macaroni cheese.”

On occasion, the princess was also known to switch things up. 

McGrady revealed to People that one afternoon, “the princess came in and said, ‘Cancel lunch today. I'm taking them out.'” When he asked where, “she said, ‘McDonald's.'” He protested—“I said, ‘I can do burgers better than McDonald's,'” he remembered—only to get the matter-of-fact response, “she said, ‘I know that, Darren, but they want the toys and the Happy Meal.' They would get fast food sometimes, just like normal families with children.”

Even with those indulgences, the princess balanced discipline with delight—making space for the boys' favorites, a spontaneous drive-thru, and, yes, the occasional beef dinner when William and Harry were home.

“Mare of Easttown” creator Brad Ingelsby is back exploring another distinctive slice of Americana with “Task,” an HBO original drama series debuting Sunday September 7 and releasing its seven-episode season weekly after that. Take a look at the newly released trailer for “Task” below.

Ingelsby became one of TV's most celebrated new creators with his 2021 limited series “Mare of Easttown,” starring Kate Winslet — IndieWire even listed “Mare of Easttown” as one of the greatest HBO series ever. A portrait of a near-suburban eastern Pennsylvania police chief, it gripped viewers with its twisty but empathetic procedural story as Winslet's cop unravels a murder mystery. It felt like one of the few cops-and-criminals crime thrillers that actually cared about its victims.

It's taken four years, but Ingelsby returns with a new series, and “Task” looks to explore other often-neglected aspects of American life. This time, Mark Ruffalo leads an FBI Task Force assigned to solving a string of armed robberies, led by a family man (Tom Pelphrey) who hardly fits the profile of career criminal.

 










Ingelsby's always been interested in life at the margins. His debut spec script, which became the 2013 film “Out of the Furnace,” came to him when he imagined what it would be like to be a criminal recently let out of prison — at the time he was writing it, the then AFI grad student was working a summer job at the famed Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio.

His work is that of deeply felt character studies, from the Sienna Miller-starring “American Woman” to the addiction recovery drama “The Way Back.” Ingelsby's most recent film is the Julianne Moore-Sydney Sweeney starring thriller “Echo Valley.”

Billed right now as a drama series, it'll be interesting to see if “Task” has multi-season potential for HBO. “Mare of Easttown” won multiple Emmys in the limited series categories for the 2020-2021 season, though it lost Best Limited Series to “The Queen's Gambit.” IndieWire is certainly excited about this one. We put “Task” on our list of our most anticipated HBO shows of 2025. Watch the trailer below.

Cindy Lee has announced a short tour of North America. The first date takes place at Chicago's Empty Bottle, on November 5, and will feature support from Freak Heat Waves and Accessory XL. Their next show, at Toronto's Massey Hall, will be opened by Blue Light. Cindy Lee will close things out at Montreal's Rialto Theatre and New York's Brooklyn Paramount. See the tour dates below.

Last year, in support of Diamond Jubilee, Cindy Lee played a handful of shows on what was called their “last American tour.” They cut the tour short, however, for undisclosed personal reasons. To an extent, these new dates are makeup shows, as Cindy Lee was due to play the Empty Bottle and venues in Brooklyn, Toronto, and Montreal.

Cindy Lee recently brought their catalog to Bandcamp (and took it off Spotify). They plan to release physical reissues of Cat o' Nine Tails, Act of Tenderness, and more later this year.

“E After Next,” the Moby rework that has become a staple of Avalon Emerson's DJ sets, has been formally released via Dead Oceans. Billed as a collaboration between the two, it is part of Emerson's dancefloor-oriented single series Perpetual Emotion Machine, which follows her 2023 dream-pop album, Avalon Emerson & the Charm.

As Emerson said upon announcing the series, “These songs were created for my DJ sets. Whether they're entirely original, edits to recontextualize old favorites, instrumental, or feature me singing, they are all part of my perpetual emotion machine. And the machine steams on.”

Moby's original, “Next Is the E,” appeared on his 1992 self-titled album; it was renamed “I Feel It” in the United Kingdom to soften any implied reference to ecstasy.

Earlier this evening (Monday, August 11), Taylor Swift updated her website with a clock counting down to 12:12 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on August 12. Now, she's announced a new album. The Life of a Showgirl will mark Swift's 12th original studio album and follow-up to 2024's The Tortured Poets Department and its extended edition, The Anthology. It's currently available to pre-order on her website, though a formal release date has yet to be shared.

On Wednesday, Swift will appear on New Heights, the podcast hosted by her boyfriend—Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce—and his brother, Jason Kelce. In a clip from the episode now posted on social media, Swift reveals a mint green briefcase with the letters “TS” in orange lettering. “I want to show you something,” Swift says. “This is my brand new album, The Life of a Showgirl.” The cover art, however, is blurred out. Watch the clip below.

In May, a re-recorded version of “Look What You Made Me Do,” the lead single from Swift's 2017 album, Reputation, appeared in The Handmaid's Tale's final season. Fans who anticipated the imminent announcement of Reputation (Taylor's Version), however, were proven wrong when, later that month, Swift shared that she had bought back the master recordings for her first six studio albums, which had been acquired by Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings LLC in 2019 and sold to Los Angeles private equity firm Shamrock Capital the following year. According to Swift, a re-recorded version of her self-titled debut album is complete, but Reputation (Taylor's Version) may remain unfinished.

The final show of Swift's Eras Tour took place on Sunday, December 8, 2024. The nearly two-year, 149-concert undertaking reportedly sold over $2 billion in tickets, making it the highest-grossing tour of all time. The Eras Tour spawned a companion book and a three-hour movie. At the 2025 Grammy Awards, Swift was nominated in six categories; she took home no trophies, but did present Beyoncé with the award for Best Country Album.

Swift announced The Tortured Poets Department onstage at the 2024 Grammy Awards after winning Best Pop Vocal Album for Midnights. It debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, marking her 14th No. 1 album, broke the record for most weekly vinyl LP sales (a record previously held by Swift herself), and became the first album to hit one billion streams on Spotify within a week of its release. Swift is currently tied with Jay-Z for the most No. 1 albums as a solo artist.

For the sake of your own sanity, sometimes you have to mock your enemies—even the ones you'll never actually meet. “I am insufferable, unbelievably satisfied/It's my place to tell you what is wrong,” John Dwyer whines on Osees' “Fight Simulator” with a slightly aristocratic, pseudo-intellectual accent. As his monologue extends—the protagonist is defective, locked up, a sadist inflicting punishment—the tempo decelerates and Dwyer's voice melts like wax dripping down a candlestick. “For how long?” he repeats slower and slower, until it's a half-asleep gargled whisper. Now, doesn't that feel better?

That's largely how ABOMINATION REVEALED AT LAST is delivered; Osees move rabidly, letting off steam to avoid imploding from the pressure buildup of nonstop loathing and disgust. Upon returning to a recording studio in Tornillo, Texas, next to a now-defunct “tent city,” Dwyer and his band—drummers Dan Rincon and Paul Quattrone, guitarist and keyboardist Tom Dolas, bassist Tim Hellman—channeled their frustration into music that spits at our slurry of fascist realities: relentless genocides, kidnapped civilians, A.I. embracement, tech billionaires unleashed in a yard with no electric fence. “It's been a long year already,” Dwyer said when announcing Osees' latest album in June. He meant to convey his exhaustion with the state of the world, but sonically, the garage-rock icon and his bandmates come across more fired up than they did on last year's synth sampler diorama Sorcs 80.

There's little need to read between the lines on ABOMINATION REVEALED AT LAST. “Musk is done/Mark is done/We want/Shift that's coming,” Dwyer howls over proto-punk drumming on “Protection,” throwing the song's brassy synth notes like darts at social media's villains. In “God's Guts,” he sees through politicians' campaigns: “I know you're a man of faith/Dipped in blood and ordained.” Osees prevent their songs from feeling like a stale regurgitation of discourse by packaging them with fury. On that latter track, Dwyer's screeches are like a cougar's most grating roar, while his bandmates enact a sped-up disco-punk shuffle. Later, on “Ashes 1,” they go full hardcore, with Rincon and Quattrone adding a tiny hiccup into their drum patterns to prevent the onslaught of noise from becoming overwhelming.

Despite a handful of truly pissed-off songs, Osees' latest doesn't offer a full sequel to the caustic punk of 2022's A Foul Form. Caffeinated jitters turn into psych-rock jams fairly often, resulting in the danceable “Glass Window” or that long guitar solo punctuating “Glüe.” On closer “Glitter-Shot,” Osees embody the disaffected post-punk of Preoccupations, right down to the deep monotone bellows, while mocking a not-hard-to-guess tyrant at the Capitol. The best of the bunch, though, is “Sneaker,” in which the two drummers lock into a krautrock groove while Hellman and Dolas play off one another. It's not too dissimilar from the loose no-wave of Chime Oblivion, Dwyer's new side-project. Only here, in the unmistakable hands of Osees, it becomes a trippy exodus that plays ever so slightly into the rhythmic swagger of the band's past work.

As Osees ride their 29th album to the finish line, Dwyer is still 100% committed. From chasing song ideas to convulsing onstage, tongue out with a guitar perched on his collarbone, he's not tired of it yet—much to his surprise. A path this long often curves enough to complete a circle, and on ABOMINATION REVEALED AT LAST, Osees begin their return flight to the garage-rock headbanging of their mid-2010s material. There's too much synth and wooden drumming to sound like a full throwback to their Thee Oh Sees days, but you wouldn't be misguided if you said the album's title and art mirror Mutilator Defeated at Last from a decade ago. (“We leave a lot to interpret on our fans,” Dwyer said about the parallels.) For now, Dwyer and his bandmates sound rejuvenated incorporating multiple genres while still letting out the pent-up punk.

Anamanaguchi, perhaps the most popular chiptune band of all time, were welcomed as ComicCon royalty recently, celebrating two decades of soundtrack synergy with a free performance alongside frontman Peter Berkman's appearance at a Scott Pilgrim EX panel. They'll return to San Diego next month for a very different kind of gig at the divey downtown club Casbah, which is sweaty, dimly lit, and subject to deafening airplane noise the moment you step outside. If ComicCon represents their past, Casbah is more suited to the identity that Anamanaguchi have adopted on their new album Anyway: guitar-toting indie-rock lifers happy to pack out your city's 200-capacity venue on any given Saturday night.

Anamanaguchi albums are so infrequent that they're mission statements by default. Endless Fantasy was 76 minutes long; its follow-up arrived six years later and was simply called [USA]. Anyway doesn't ask skeptics to forget everything they know about the group; rather, it just replaces the expansive, intimidating lore of its past with more familiar touchstones. Yes, that's the American Football house on the cover. Yes, lead single “Darcie” is a waltzing alt-rock tribute to the co-founder of Polyvinyl, which offers the American Football house as an AirBnb for artistic retreats. Yes, “Darcie” does sound like Weezer—the Pinkerton version, with Dave Fridmann as their engineer. Anyway was recorded at Fridmann's Tarbox Studios and in his proverbial wheelhouse of redlined drums and compressed synth lines, giving Anamanaguchi the jagged edges to satisfy their newfound taste for rock candy.

Despite the album cover, there's no “'90s Midwest emo” in Anamanaguchi's revamped sound, though there is plenty of '90s emo from the Midwest—bands like the Get Up Kids and the Anniversary, too sentimentally rooted in punk to lose the genre tag, even as they strove to pass as synth-spiked power-pop. Anamanaguchi's rebrand kicks off with a song about the unpredictable spark of inspiration, but they don't invoke comparisons to blowtorches or fireworks displays. It's called “Sparkler,” something more suitable for Anamanaguchi's tastes—the charming, the lo-fi, the handheld. Likewise, “Sapphire” looks wistfully back on their roots schlepping “Game Boys and guitars on the A Train” to DIY gigs, archived files “small and full of life.”

Conversely, “Valley of Silence” might be the first time Anamanaguchi have gone for big and full of sorrow; if not for Songs of a Lost World, it might be the most convincing Disintegration cosplay of the past 30-odd years. But while the former is the work of a band revisiting its own strengths, “Valley of Silence” is Anamanaguchi discovering an entirely new context. The song's doleful cinematic scope contrasts with the ugly realities that ground Anyway in the here and now: In “Rage (Kitchen Sink),” Berkman confronts the black hole of someone's all-encompassing joylessness, and in the deceptively triumphant closer “Nightlife,” he sings, “Bodies of children lie covered in gauze”; it's not hard to guess which children he's referring to.

These moments don't contradict the album's primary lyrical theme, which is a celebration of Anamanaguchi's own creativity. If anything, the occasional reference to kill screens or update patches makes me think of them within the context of the Twitch superstars with whom they've rubbed shoulders at ComicCon. “You wave the bag like it's a fortune, keep pretending that it's worth the trade,” Berkman sneers on “Come for Us” perhaps having absorbed some lessons from covering Nirvana's “Territorial Pissings” (and licensing songs to Target and Taco Bell). He might be highlighting the moral quandary that unifies established bands and up-and-coming streamers: the imperative to turn your own life into a never-ending stream of content (“So much potential when you tell us/It's essential that we make more vids”). In response, he gives voice to the independent streak that has long served the band: “When they come for us, I'll be late.” Anamanaguchi embraced nerd culture long before it was mainstream. Now, though they've inverted the ratio of guitars to video games in their music, they still refuse to follow the rules of fashion.

	Is Deadpool joining the Avengers? Ryan Reynolds posted a cryptic image on Instagram last night that suggests his foul-mouthed character may be teaming up with Earth's mightiest heroes in the forthcoming Avengers: Doomsday or Avengers: Secret Wars.


	Reynolds shared a photo of the Avengers black and white logo, which has been covered with a red spray-painted “A” that appears to be the work of Deadpool. Fans were quick to jump on the potential crossover, with many commenting about their excitement. 

A post shared by Ryan Reynolds (@vancityreynolds)


Marvel revealed the enormous cast of Avengers: Doomsday in a livestream in March. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo had previously heralded the return of the franchise's beloved actor, Robert Downey Jr., during an appearance at San Diego Comic-Con in 2024. Downey Jr. will play villain Doctor Doom (despite his longtime character Iron Man dying in Avengers: Endgame), who recently popped up in the post-credits scene in Fantastic Four: First Steps. 

	











	Earlier this year, Reynolds shot down speculation that Deadpool would be part of an Avengers film. “If Deadpool becomes an Avenger or an X-Man, we're at the end,” the actor told Time. “That's wish fulfillment, and you can't give him that.” He added, “I'm writing a little something right now, that's, I don't know, it's an ensemble. But, I like that [Deadpool] is isolated.”

	Deadpool last appeared onscreen in 2024's Deadpool & Wolverine, which reunited Reynolds' beloved character with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. In a review of the film, Rolling Stone noted that the movie by introducing the characters into the MCU, it was “signaling a bold new step towards total superhero-property synergy.”

	











	In May, Marvel Studios announced that Avengers: Doomsday had been moved back from May 1, 2026, to Dec. 18, 2026, while its follow-up will now arrive in theaters on Dec. 17, 2027 instead of May 7, 2027.

	Larisha Paul



Travis Kelce‘s relationship with Taylor Swift feels more like the 1989 deep cut “You Are in Love” than the camera-flashing chaos of “Blank Space.” When asked how they keep their romance alive while navigating being in the public eye, the Kansas City Chiefs player told GQ, “Whenever I'm with her, it feels like we're just regular people. When there is not a camera on us, we're just two people that are in love.”


	Kelce and Swift began dating in 2023, when he was fresh off of his team's Super Bowl LVII win and Swift was in the early months of the career-spanning Eras Tour. Some believed they witnessed the couple hard-launch their relationship when Swift attended a Chiefs game after being publicly courted by Kelce, but of course, they had been dating privately for a while before then. “It can be perceived as something else because of how much it is talked about and how much we are tracked whenever we do go out,” Kelce said. “It happened very organically, even though from a media standpoint it was being tracked. It still happened very organically.”

	











	He added, “Nothing I've ever done has been a controlled, organized process. When I say it was so organic, we fell in love just based off the people we were sitting in a room together with. We are two fun-loving people who have the morals to appreciate everyone for who they are. We share all those values. It kind of just took the fuck off.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Their mutual understanding of how to navigate the media landscape is something Kelce values in their relationship. “I hadn't experienced somebody in the same shoes as me, having a partner who understands the scrutiny, understands the ups and downs of being in front of millions,” he said. There was also overlap in the physical demands of their respective careers. “That was very relatable, seeing how exhausted she would get after shows,” Kelce added. “She may not think of herself as an athlete. She will never tell anyone that she is an athlete. But I've seen what she goes through. I've seen the amount of work that she puts on her body, and it's mind-blowing.”

	Kelce managed to catch a few shows on the Eras Tour, waiting in the wings as Swift tweaked her lyrics to shout out “the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me.” He even joined her onstage in London as a dancer during “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.” He's witnessed firsthand how grueling those three-hour-long shows could be.


	“To go out on a stage, on a computer, essentially, for three hours. The [Eras Tour] floor is literally—I've seen underneath that thing. It is a football-field-sized computer,” Kelce said. “You take that into Singapore, where it is scorching hot, and all of a sudden you're feeling the fumes from the computer and you're feeling the fumes from the sun and you're doing a show for three hours with a lot of energy, bringing it every single song. That is arguably more exhausting than how much I put in on a Sunday, and she's doing it three, four, five days in a row.”


	Swift has been to her fair share of Chiefs games, now, too. “I sort of made her a football fan,” Kelce said. “She is the most engulfed fan now. She knows what the injury reports look like. She understands what special situations are, third and short—all these things because she just naturally loves to hear about my job.” He enjoys the balance of showing up for each other. “I get to be the plus one,” he said. “I get to go and be that fan. Because I am a fan. I'm a fan of music. I'm a fan of art. And it's so cool that I get to experience her being that plus one for me on the football field…. I feel that same enjoyment every time she comes to my shows.”


	Kelce is also learning the dynamism of performance from Swift. “Whenever I get in front of a crowd, I feel like I've got to be like, ‘Woooo!' Like, excited, bringing the energy. Then I saw that coolness and that calmness and that relatability that she is so good at presenting,” he said. “I really grabbed that. Like, man, I can use that side of entertainment as well. It's not just always being the guy that brings the energy and creates these exciting moments.”

	“People gravitate towards how she performs and how she makes it feel like the entire stadium is in this little room with her,” he continued. “She is so good at mesmerizing everybody and making everybody feel like it's an intimate situation.

	In a brief but powerful letter, Madonna asked Pope Leo XIV to visit the Gaza Strip “before it's too late.” In a Monday Instagram post, the pop icon called on the religious leader as attacks from Israel continue amid its war with Hamas.


	“Most Holy Father, please go to Gaza and bring your light to the children before it's too late. AS a mother, I cannot bear to watch their suffering. The children of the world belong to everyone,” Madonna wrote. “You are the only one of us who cannot be denied entry.”


	She added: “We need the humanitarian gates to be fully opened to save these innocent children. There is no more time. Please say you will go.”

	In her caption of the brief note, Madonna shared that it was her son Rocco's birthday and said that it would be the “best gift” to ask her followers to do what they can to “help save the innocent children caught in the crossfire in Gaza.”


	“I am not pointing fingers, placing blame or taking sides. Everyone is suffering. Including the mothers of the hostages. I pray that they are released as well,” she wrote. “I am merely trying to do what I can to keep these children from dying of starvation.”

	In addition to the pope, the star tagged several organizations offering support to the families of Gaza who are struggling during the escalating humanitarian crisis.

	Back in May, Pope Leo used his first-ever General Audience in St. Peter's Basilica to call on Israel to release aid into Gaza. “I renew my fervent appeal to allow for the entry of fair humanitarian help and to bring to an end the hostilities, the devastating price of which is paid by children, the elderly and the sick,” Leo said, calling conditions in Gaza “increasingly worrying and painful.” 

	











	Leo's plea for aid to Gaza continues the work of his predecessor Pope Francis, who was vocal in his support for the Palestinian people, and continued to call for a cease-fire in Gaza up to the day before he died.

	Even before Donald Trump officially began his second term in office, his family businesses were beginning the race to milk the presidency for every cent they could. Now, a new analysis from The New Yorker has put a potential dollar figure on how much Trump's crypto ventures, real estate deals, licensing agreements, and other grifts have netted America's first family over the course of Trump's time in politics: a staggering $3.4 billion.


	The total is an estimate, as the Trump Organization and its various auxiliary companies and ventures — which are largely under the control of the president's adult children — have not been entirely transparent regarding their finances.


The New Yorker estimated that the president's various cryptocurrency had generated at least $2.37 billion in value, financial investments coordinated by Donald Jr. and Eric Trump have generated $339.6 million, and Trump's flagship Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, has raked in $125 million in extra profits.

	











	Tack onto that $127.7 million in legal fee collection and merchandise sales and a media empire estimated to be worth $116 million, and it becomes clear that the Trumps have built themselves a corporate empire on the back of their patriarch's public office.

	Just last month, the president took a detour from a state trip to Scotland, for which millions of taxpayer dollars were spent on travel and security, to inaugurate a new Trump golf course near Aberdeen, Scotland. On that same trip, Trump hosted British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at his private Turnberry golf club — which (as was the practice during Trump's first term) will likely profit off of the president's choice to use it as a venue. The same week, it was reported that Trump has privately discussed hosting the G20 summit of world leaders at his Doral golf club.

	











	As previously reported by Rolling Stone, the president has complained to his inner circle that it was “stupid” of him to leave so much money on the table during his first term, and that he planned to rectify his mistake the second time around.

	The fact that the family's business deals making headlines around the world are being coordinated by Trump's children is a convenient loophole that allows the president to escape many of the disclosure and ethics laws that govern private investments by public officials.


	After years accusing his political opponents — and their sons — of leveraging the status of the White House to enrich themselves, the Trumps are engaged in an open campaign of open grift unlike any in the history of the Oval Office, and Americans are now just beginning to get a full picture of just how rich the People's House is making the president.

Jimmy Kimmel‘s dislike of President Donald Trump seems to have reached an inflection point. The late-night host has felt so dismayed by the administration's fascist policies that he's set up a bit of a contingency plan to flee the country altogether if need be. During a recent appearance on The Sarah Silverman podcast, Kimmel informed his ex and fellow comedian that an intercontinental move may be in store after he obtained his Italian citizenship.


	“A lot of people I know are thinking about where are they going to get citizenship?” Silverman said. Kimmel replied, “I did get Italian citizenship,” noting, “What's going on [with Trump] is as bad as you thought it was gonna be. It's so much worse; it's just unbelievable. I feel like it's probably even worse than he would like it to be.”

	Kimmel has been a vocal detractor of Trump during both of his terms. Following Trump's first 100 days in office, the comedian dedicated an opening monologue on his show to roasting the inefficiency of the government. “It's difficult to give Trump's first 100 days a grade, but if I had to I'd say it falls somewhere between F and U,” he said. “Don't get me wrong, there have been some positives. Unfortunately, they have all been pregnancy tests for women who slept with Elon Musk.” Noting how little Trump got done, he said, “None of those achievements are achievements,” he said. “The penny is gone and straws are back. Wow, America really is great again, isn't it? This tells you all you need to know about how things are going for Trump.”

	











	If Kimmel leaves the United States, he would join Rosie O'Donnell and Ellen DeGeneres as celebrities who fled the United States after Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in last November's presidential election.

	Sweater weather is coming — and so is another Mayday Parade release. The pop-punkers have announced, Sad, the second installment of their 20th anniversary album trilogy, out Oct. 3. The band also shared reflective rocker, “Under My Sweater,” alongside a new music video.


	“It's difficult to sing about a sweater without invoking Weezer, but that's part of what I love about this song,” Derek Sanders said in a statement. With its melancholy riffs and Nineties-inspired percussion, Sanders described the song as “a part of old school nostalgic emo” but with a modern twist.


Sad comes on the heels of the band's first release of the three-part album, Sweet, which arrived in April. As the title suggests, this new installment serves as a counterpart to its predecessor with a softer, more introspective mood compared to the anthemic pop-punk vitality of Sweet. It seems especially fitting for the forthcoming fall season. Even with its contrasting sound, Sad brings back producers Zack Odom and Kenneth Mount into the fold.

	











	Though a track list for Sad has yet to be released, a press release promises heartbreak, ballads, and loads of fall-time, Nineties nostalgia for songs like “Promises,” “One Day At a Time,” and “I Miss the 90s.” Album closer “I Must Obey The Inscrutable Exhortations Of My Soul” brings back Mayday Parade's penchant for long, emo-inspired song titles and is set to be the band's “most ambitious recording to date.”

	The release of Sweet and Sad coincides with the start of Mayday Parade's 20th anniversary tour, where the band will revisit their entire discography across several U.S. cities and celebrate their two decades together.


	In an interview with Rolling Stone earlier this year, the band revealed how the unconventional album trilogy idea came to be. As Mayday Parade went into the studio to record their first LP since 2021's What It Means to Fall Apart, Sanders realized their 20th anniversary was coming up, and it inspired the band to change course. “We just thought, ‘What if we tried to do something bigger and more grand?'” he said, adding, “It's kind of an experiment and feels like the right time to try something like this.”

            A late-night dog walk in Gosport has turned into something rather more unusual for one local resident, who claims to have spotted not one but two unidentified flying objects in the early hours of Tuesday 9th July 2025.
        

According to a report submitted to the National UFO Reporting Centre (NUFORC) website, the incident occurred at around 1:15am. The witness, whose name has not been released, described seeing two bright, star-like objects high in the sky. Initially motionless, the lights suddenly began moving rapidly toward each other. Rather than colliding, they reportedly circled one another for a short period before abruptly accelerating away in opposite directions.

The sighting, the report says, lasted for approximately five minutes before the objects disappeared from view.

The National UFO Reporting Centre, based in the United States, collects eyewitness accounts from around the world. Although most sightings turn out to have conventional explanations — such as satellites, drones, aircraft lights, or astronomical phenomena — some reports remain unexplained after investigation. This Gosport case has yet to be analysed in detail.

The timing of the sighting comes amid growing global fascination with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) — the term now preferred by governments and defence agencies for what the public traditionally calls UFOs. In recent years, the US Congress has held hearings on the subject, prompted in part by declassified US Navy videos showing fast-moving airborne objects that military pilots could not identify.

Such high-profile discussions have led to a surge in public interest, with more people coming forward to share their own observations of strange lights and objects in the sky. Reports have been logged from countries across the globe, with patterns often emerging during warm, clear weather when more people are outdoors at night.

Whether the Gosport sighting turns out to be an example of advanced human-made technology, an atmospheric illusion, or something altogether more mysterious, it joins a growing catalogue of eyewitness accounts feeding the ongoing debate about what might be out there.

For now, the dog walker's account stands as another entry in NUFORC's long-running database — a reminder that, even on an ordinary night walk, the skies can sometimes hold extraordinary surprises.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard says she still has more questions than answers, despite the Trump administration's January claim that the sightings were not nefarious.

Editor's note: Welcome to the world of “Paranormal PA,” a PennLive series that delves into Pennsylvania-grown stories of spirits; cryptids; oddities and legends; and the unexplained. Sign up here to get our Paranormal PA newsletter delivered to your inbox.

Many a comparison can be drawn between your average classic rock star and the Mothman. 

He's mysterious. A bit of a loner. Came up in the sixties. And has a dedicated fanbase that's spawned conventions and a series of erotica. 

But while Mothman is undoubtedly the cryptid of West Virginia, the reach and sightings of this red-eye, winged, moth-like humanoid have expanded beyond the Mountain State and into places like Pennsylvania.

In “John A. Keel: The Man, the Myths, and the Ongoing Mysteries (2019),” Greensburg-based paranormal researcher Stan Gordon tells author Brent Raynes that the first time Mothman popped up in Pennsylvania was in the summer of 1966, in a wooded part of Allegheny County, right near Pittsburgh.

As Gordon tells it, a young man was shaken up after a “strange creature leaped onto the back of his black convertible.” The young man gunned it, terrified, causing the thing to fall off his car, leaving “streaks of a white, juicy substance on the back of the vehicle.” Teenagers began to report creepy encounters with a tall, winged creature in the woods; UFO activity was even reported in the area around the same time. 

And the sightings didn't stop then, either. The York Daily Record mentions a few reports in Adams County in the 1980s and a video of a purported Mothman sighting in Monroeville circulated on the Internet in 2017. Tobias Wayland, co-author of “Mothman: Sightings and Investigations of Iconic Flying Cryptid (2025),” tells Paranormal PA via email he even got a report from a person in Levittown several years ago “who said they saw something that ‘had the body of a human, but it had wings,' climb over their fence and crawl towards them before emitting a terrifying scream and flying away.”

Now, eagle-eyed Mothman aficionados might recognize 1966 as the year of the first official Mothman sighting took place. In fact, Gordon's account places the Mothman sightings in Pennsylvania as having happened before the most famous sighting in West Virginia.

That was on a fateful night in November of that year. “Mothman: The Facts Behind the Legend (2002)” reports that two couples — the Scarberrys and the Mallettes — spotted what a Point Pleasant Register article then called a “man-sized bird … creature … something!” near the McClintic Wildlife Station in Point Pleasant, West Virginia. 

“They told a deputy sheriff it looked like ‘a flying man with 10-foot wings,'” the Kalamazoo Gazette later reported. “They said it was about seven feet tall with large red eyes.”

The Gazette explained that the story had drawn curious onlookers to the site, and, for about three days afterward, at least eight other people reported seeing the same creature. The name “Mothman” didn't take too long to start popping up in coverage.

But what was Mothman? Well, the Springfield Daily News proclaimed “W. Virginia Mothman Not From Outer Space,” weeding at least one theory out (although theories about Mothman's extraterrestrial origins persist). 

Some speculated he was a supernatural entity, while John Keel put forward the idea in his 1975 book “Mothman Prophecies” that Mothman was “Ultraterrestrial,” or an ancient hidden race of beings that that have lived beside us in secret. Others said it was probably just a big bird. 

“The phenomenon currently defies easy explanation,” wrote Richard Estep, the other co-author of “Mothman,” to Paranormal PA via email. “We couldn't nail that answer down in 70,000 words.

“I think it's one aspect of a multi-faceted phenomenon that manifests in different ways at different times for people, and is part of the flying humanoid subset of anomalies. What I can say with confidence is that it's probably much weirder than we think it is.”

Whatever he was (or is), the initial madness of the Mothman story eventually died down. According to the Gazette, it seemed like the excitement over the whole thing had at last fizzled out as the fad it was after a few weeks.

But here we are, almost 60 years later, and the Mothman legend has continued to live — vivaciously almost, despite the fact he supposedly serves as a bad omen. There's an annual festival, books, merchandise, and a 2002 adaptation of the classic John Keel book, “The Mothman Prophecies,” starring Richard Gere and Laura Linney (and which, it just so happens, was filmed in Pittsburgh).

So what is it that makes the Mothman legend so popular outside of its West Virginia roots, especially considering there are plenty of other localized legends that don't nearly have as big a fanbase (see the squonk)? In fact, why are people so enamored with cryptozoology in general, when practically all of modern science points to the unlikelihood in the existence of creatures like Bigfoot or Raystown Ray?

According to Estep and Wayland, it's not that Mr. Mothman has some sort of je nais se quoi, but, rather the fact that creature sightings were brought up in national news each time a disaster such as a bridge collapse occurred. That, and the film adaptation brought the legend to a wider audience.

“I think Mothman speaks to us on a very deep level,” Wayland said. “The amount of strange phenomena associated with the mystery — everything from UFOs to hauntings to Mothman's uncanny nature — speak to a hidden reality that people find compelling.

“The world is a terrifying place that isn't made less so by understanding it, but perhaps in attempting to understand high strangeness, we can find an escape from it; either metaphorically, in the same way we escape into a movie or book, or literally, in the sense that if there is some invisible world inhabited by such beings, maybe we'd rather live there then here.”

However, out of all the supernatural phenomenon that people believe in, many skeptics raise their eyebrows particularly high when it comes to cryptozoology: Wouldn't scientists have discovered a Bigfoot-like species by now, skeptics ask? Wouldn't modern-day cameras and other technology have captured proof of Nessie?

Well, similar to other legends — like that pair of tombstones in Pennsylvania that's believed to bring about the end of the world — Wayland explains that cryptid legends “speak to different anxieties.” Specifically, ennui. 

“Cryptids are about our fear that there's nothing new to discover in the world,” Wayland says. 

Whether or not Mothman is a symbol of a deeper fear — or just a fun story to partake in — he remains high on the totem pole of American legends. You can even get into him. yourself, if you want: There's that festival, a Mothman 5K, and a plethora of media you can consume, from books to video games.

As for the Mothman erotica ... you can look that up in your own time.

 Recording artist MGK — formerly known as Machine Gun Kelly — does not think he's from the earthly realm, according to himself (and his alleged interplanetary bloodline).


 During a Sunday night appearance on Andy Cohen's Bravo talk show Watch What Happens Live, the rapper (previously reported to be 35 years old, but now TBD) responded to a question about his age in a state of confusion.


 ""It's a weird thing, dude, I don't know if my age... I don't know if it exists,"" he said.

 Cohen asked, ""You have a Mariah Carey connection to your age? It's very fluid?"" with reference to Carey's admitted refusal to acknowledge time.


 ""I don't know many facts about my life, so I don't know,"" MGK responded. ""I'm starting to be like, if my skin rips open, it heals really quick. I'm starting to be like, who's my dad?""


 Cohen pressed on, asking, ""Do you think you could be otherworldly?"" to which MGK responded, ""I asked my mom, is there any period of time you went missing? A tall, slender creature?""


 Fellow WWHL guest Pamela Adlon quipped, ""That tracks,"" before MGK continued.


 ""She told me she felt like she got abducted at one point,"" recalled MGK. ""I'm bad at talking, I shouldn't have came on a talk show.""


 Entertainment Weekly has reached out to a representative for MGK for additional information on his suspected alien heritage.


 Perhaps MGK is who The View moderator Whoopi Goldberg warned her cohosts about in March 2024, when she confirmed live on the air that aliens are, in fact, walking among us on earth.


 ""I think they're waiting for us to clean up a little bit so that they can come here and tell us we're really messing things up,"" View guest Kumail Nanjiani joked about alien beings, before Goldberg responded in earnest with her findings about extraterrestrial existence.


 ""They're already here,"" she said, calmly. ""They're already ... They've been here for quite some time.""


 A stunned Nanjiani turned to Goldberg for more information, as the Ghost actress did not reveal how — or why — she knew of her findings that she brought to the Hot Topics table.

 ""And what are they doing?"" he asked, to which she responded: ""They're watching us."" Or, perhaps they're simply singing the 2016 song ""Bad Things"" (feat. Camilla Cabello).

Machine Gun Kelly thinks he might be part-alien. 

The Tickets to My Downfall hitmaker appeared on the August 10 episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen and explained why he thinks he's extraterrestrial. 

""It's a weird thing, dude,"" he began, ""I don't know if my age...I don't know if it exists.""

The standout, born Colson Baker, who shares 4-month-old Saga Blade with ex Megan Fox and 16-year-old Casie with ex Emma Cannon, revealed that he doesn't know a few key details about his life, like his real age and who his father is. 

""I just don't know many facts about my life. Like my skin, if it rips open, it heals really quick. There's just things where I'm starting to be like, ‘Who's my dad?'""

Kelly's mother has even admitted that, at one point in her life, she feels like she might have been abducted. 

""Yeah, I've asked my mom. Was there any period of time you went missing, like off the Earth? Was there ever like a tall slender creature?' She told me she felt like she got abducted at one point.""

Jared Padalecki revealed the one Supernatural relationship that he wishes had not happened. Over the 15 seasons that Supernatural aired, Sam and Dean Winchester had many different relationships, especially Dean, who was a notorious womanizer. However, rather interestingly, despite being the “ladies man” of the CW show, Dean actually had fewer love interests than Sam.

Although Supernatural ended in 2020, fans and stars of the show are still reflecting on its legacy, with Jensen Ackles (Dean) and Jared Padalecki (Sam) attending various fan conventions around the world. One of the things that was recently discussed was their characters' decisions in the show, which brought up an interesting comment from Padalecki about Sam Winchester's love interests.

At a FAN EXPO Boston panel, in which ScreenRant was in attendance, Padalecki was asked if Sam would make any decisions differently now. Padalecki responded that he doesn't think Sam would have gotten into a relationship with Amelia. He also expressed that he wished Sam had looked harder for Dean when he was in Purgatory. Check out his quote below:

Amelia. I don't think he would've gotten into a romantic relationship after his brother… over a dog, yeah.

 Amelia Richardson (Liane Balaban) was a veterinarian introduced in season 8. She became a love interest of Sam's while Dean was missing and presumed dead in Purgatory. The two formed an unlikely bond after Sam accidentally hit a dog with his car, leading to a quiet suburban storyline that was somewhat disconnected from the show's supernatural drama.

Padalecki's comment seems to suggest that he agrees with some of the fan criticism surrounding Amelia, which states that the relationship felt forced and Sam's lack of focus on finding his missing brother felt out of sync with the Winchesters' usual actions. The “over a dog” remark only highlights how Padalecki seemingly felt the relationship was a bit too convenient.

 While there was nothing particularly wrong with Amelia's character, the whole romantic plotline with Sam did feel strangely out of place at the time. Amelia was an interesting addition in season 8, as she brought a complicated relationship with her presumed-dead husband, who eventually returns. Interestingly, she is also one of Supernatural's few major love interest characters who doesn't die.

Yet, as Dean and Castiel vanished into Purgatory after fighting Dick Roman and the Leviathans, one of Supernatural's most powerful creatures, it wasn't the right time for Sam's romantic subplot. It was almost too obviously a mirror of Dean's relationship with Lisa when Sam was presumed dead in Supernatural season 6, and for that reason, Padalecki's comments are justified.

Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3, episode 5 introduced a chilling new villain that exceeds the threat posed by the Gorn.

Titus Welliver takes on a new role as a troubled NYPD officer in this thrilling mob series that could finally fill the void left by the end of Narcos.

Intense martial arts action and fight scenes aren't limited to the big screen, as these incredibly martial arts TV shows all prove.

Crime dramas feel a dime a dozen in the 2020s, which makes this hit Amazon Prime Video series' ability to stand out all the more impressive.

Some of the best TV shows ever are in the crime drama genre, and HBO Max has the very best of these original series available to stream.

One major Supernatural star suggests that the show's earliest major villain was far from the scariest, as that honor fell to a normal human.","{'href': 'https://screenrant.com', 'title': 'Screen Rant'}","other"

Editor's note: Welcome to the world of “Paranormal PA,” a PennLive series that delves into Pennsylvania-grown stories of spirits; cryptids; oddities and legends; and the unexplained. Sign up here to get our Paranormal PA newsletter delivered to your inbox.

Many a comparison can be drawn between your average classic rock star and the Mothman. 

He's mysterious. A bit of a loner. Came up in the sixties. And has a dedicated fanbase that's spawned conventions and a series of erotica. 

But while Mothman is undoubtedly the cryptid of West Virginia, the reach and sightings of this red-eye, winged, moth-like humanoid have expanded beyond the Mountain State and into places like Pennsylvania.

In “John A. Keel: The Man, the Myths, and the Ongoing Mysteries (2019),” Greensburg-based paranormal researcher Stan Gordon tells author Brent Raynes that the first time Mothman popped up in Pennsylvania was in the summer of 1966, in a wooded part of Allegheny County, right near Pittsburgh.

As Gordon tells it, a young man was shaken up after a “strange creature leaped onto the back of his black convertible.” The young man gunned it, terrified, causing the thing to fall off his car, leaving “streaks of a white, juicy substance on the back of the vehicle.” Teenagers began to report creepy encounters with a tall, winged creature in the woods; UFO activity was even reported in the area around the same time. 

And the sightings didn't stop then, either. The York Daily Record mentions a few reports in Adams County in the 1980s and a video of a purported Mothman sighting in Monroeville circulated on the Internet in 2017. Tobias Wayland, co-author of “Mothman: Sightings and Investigations of Iconic Flying Cryptid (2025),” tells Paranormal PA via email he even got a report from a person in Levittown several years ago “who said they saw something that ‘had the body of a human, but it had wings,' climb over their fence and crawl towards them before emitting a terrifying scream and flying away.”

Now, eagle-eyed Mothman aficionados might recognize 1966 as the year of the first official Mothman sighting took place. In fact, Gordon's account places the Mothman sightings in Pennsylvania as having happened before the most famous sighting in West Virginia.

That was on a fateful night in November of that year. “Mothman: The Facts Behind the Legend (2002)” reports that two couples — the Scarberrys and the Mallettes — spotted what a Point Pleasant Register article then called a “man-sized bird … creature … something!” near the McClintic Wildlife Station in Point Pleasant, West Virginia. 

“They told a deputy sheriff it looked like ‘a flying man with 10-foot wings,'” the Kalamazoo Gazette later reported. “They said it was about seven feet tall with large red eyes.”

The Gazette explained that the story had drawn curious onlookers to the site, and, for about three days afterward, at least eight other people reported seeing the same creature. The name “Mothman” didn't take too long to start popping up in coverage.

But what was Mothman? Well, the Springfield Daily News proclaimed “W. Virginia Mothman Not From Outer Space,” weeding at least one theory out (although theories about Mothman's extraterrestrial origins persist). 

Some speculated he was a supernatural entity, while John Keel put forward the idea in his 1975 book “Mothman Prophecies” that Mothman was “Ultraterrestrial,” or an ancient hidden race of beings that that have lived beside us in secret. Others said it was probably just a big bird. 

“The phenomenon currently defies easy explanation,” wrote Richard Estep, the other co-author of “Mothman,” to Paranormal PA via email. “We couldn't nail that answer down in 70,000 words.

“I think it's one aspect of a multi-faceted phenomenon that manifests in different ways at different times for people, and is part of the flying humanoid subset of anomalies. What I can say with confidence is that it's probably much weirder than we think it is.”

Whatever he was (or is), the initial madness of the Mothman story eventually died down. According to the Gazette, it seemed like the excitement over the whole thing had at last fizzled out as the fad it was after a few weeks.

But here we are, almost 60 years later, and the Mothman legend has continued to live — vivaciously almost, despite the fact he supposedly serves as a bad omen. There's an annual festival, books, merchandise, and a 2002 adaptation of the classic John Keel book, “The Mothman Prophecies,” starring Richard Gere and Laura Linney (and which, it just so happens, was filmed in Pittsburgh).

So what is it that makes the Mothman legend so popular outside of its West Virginia roots, especially considering there are plenty of other localized legends that don't nearly have as big a fanbase (see the squonk)? In fact, why are people so enamored with cryptozoology in general, when practically all of modern science points to the unlikelihood in the existence of creatures like Bigfoot or Raystown Ray?

According to Estep and Wayland, it's not that Mr. Mothman has some sort of je nais se quoi, but, rather the fact that creature sightings were brought up in national news each time a disaster such as a bridge collapse occurred. That, and the film adaptation brought the legend to a wider audience.

“I think Mothman speaks to us on a very deep level,” Wayland said. “The amount of strange phenomena associated with the mystery — everything from UFOs to hauntings to Mothman's uncanny nature — speak to a hidden reality that people find compelling.

“The world is a terrifying place that isn't made less so by understanding it, but perhaps in attempting to understand high strangeness, we can find an escape from it; either metaphorically, in the same way we escape into a movie or book, or literally, in the sense that if there is some invisible world inhabited by such beings, maybe we'd rather live there then here.”

However, out of all the supernatural phenomenon that people believe in, many skeptics raise their eyebrows particularly high when it comes to cryptozoology: Wouldn't scientists have discovered a Bigfoot-like species by now, skeptics ask? Wouldn't modern-day cameras and other technology have captured proof of Nessie?

Well, similar to other legends — like that pair of tombstones in Pennsylvania that's believed to bring about the end of the world — Wayland explains that cryptid legends “speak to different anxieties.” Specifically, ennui. 

“Cryptids are about our fear that there's nothing new to discover in the world,” Wayland says. 

Whether or not Mothman is a symbol of a deeper fear — or just a fun story to partake in — he remains high on the totem pole of American legends. You can even get into him. yourself, if you want: There's that festival, a Mothman 5K, and a plethora of media you can consume, from books to video games.

As for the Mothman erotica ... you can look that up in your own time.

If you love your mysteries with a touch of the supernatural, then this list is for you. Psychic detective stories bring an eerie twist to crime-solving, blending intuitive insight with spine-chilling suspense. These protagonists aren't just reading clues, they're reading minds, seeing visions and stepping into the unknown to crack cases that leave ordinary investigators stumped. Whether you enjoy dark thrillers, quirky paranormals or deeply emotional psychological mysteries, these audiobooks deliver suspenseful stories packed with psychic sleuthing.

So, plug in your headphones, close your eyes (unless you're driving, of course) and get ready for a binge-worthy lineup of gripping audiobooks that'll keep you guessing until the last second.

Performed by Joshua Jackson, Oracle is a psychological thriller that introduces Nate Russo, an FBI psychic with a disturbing ability. When he touches someone close to a victim, he sees the terrifying moments leading up to their disappearance. It's a gift that comes at a terrible cost, eating away at Russo's mind as he's pulled into a complex investigation involving missing girls, a chilling conspiracy and a darkness that may consume him. Pyper's writing is razor-sharp and atmospheric and Jackson's performance adds a grounded, emotional intensity to this tense, haunting narrative. Perfect for listeners who want the psychological weight of Mindhunter with a paranormal twist.

While Amos Decker isn't a psychic, his mind works in ways that are just as intriguing. After a devastating hit on the football field, he developed hyperthymesia and synesthesia, which means he forgets nothing and experiences memories through vivid colors and textures. This uncanny mental landscape makes him a formidable detective, especially when a shocking massacre strikes close to home. Memory Man launches Baldacci's bestselling series with grit and emotional depth, while the audiobook — expertly narrated by Ron McLarty and Orlagh Cassidy — hits a perfect rhythm for fans of cerebral, character-driven thrillers.

Samantha Blair has spent her life tormented by psychic visions, violent flashes that crash into her mind without warning, leaving her shaken and terrified. But when one of these waking nightmares reveals a murder in chilling, visceral detail, she risks everything to bring the truth to the police. Detective Brandt Sutherland, skeptical but intrigued, soon learns that Sam's gift is as real as it is harrowing. Tuesday's Child blends romantic suspense with a gripping psychic-mystery hook, crafting a heroine whose courage burns through the darkness of her visions. Perfect for readers who want their thrills tangled with heart and high stakes.

August Chase isn't just a private eye … he's a narcoleptic investigator who can step directly into the crimes he's solving. Each time sleep claims him, his dreams reconstruct the scene through the victim's eyes, turning slumber into an intentional act of detection. In Dream State, a missing person case draws him into a world far stranger and deadlier than expected. Hinckley marries noir grit with surreal dream imagery, creating an atmosphere both hypnotic and hard-edged. The audiobook's pacing and style are pitch-perfect for fans of unconventional sleuths and supernatural-noir blends.

A cheeky, genre-bending mystery, The Misadventure of the Psychic Detective follows Ethan Bell, a British psychic with a sarcastic streak and a talent for finding trouble. When a séance goes sideways, Ethan stumbles into a bizarre murder mystery full of ghosts, oddball suspects and more twists than a Victorian penny dreadful. Stadon's writing is sharp and witty and the audiobook brings Ethan's dry humor and chaotic charm to life. It's equal parts parody and homage, perfect for listeners who enjoy their supernatural sleuthing with a heavy dose of irreverent fun.

Mary Bergen has psychic visions that help the police track down brutal killers, but her gift comes from trauma. When she begins having disturbing visions of murders that haven't happened yet, Mary is forced to confront her past, her darkest fears and a deadly truth that's closing in fast. The Vision is classic Koontz: fast-paced, eerie and emotionally charged. The audiobook builds a tense atmosphere as the line between premonition and reality begins to blur. If you're drawn to dark psychological suspense with supernatural elements and a strong female lead, this one should be on your list.

Willa is a small-town psychic who sees violent messages in bones — literal messages etched into remains. When a child's remains are found with a chilling message that only she can interpret, Willa is dragged into a case that exposes secrets buried deep in her community. Message in the Bones is the first in a paranormal crime series that blends rural mystery with chilling clairvoyance. Merriman paints a vivid picture of trauma, intuition and personal strength, while the narrator brings Willa's voice to life with empathy and urgency. This series is ideal for fans of slower-burn mysteries with haunting, human stakes.

Monique Snyman's mind is a confusing bedlam of glitter and death, where candy-coated gore is found in abundance and homicidal unicorns thrive. Sorting out the mess in her head is particularly irksome before she's ingested a specific amount of coffee, which is equal to half the recommended intake of water for humans per day. When she's not playing referee to her imaginary friends or trying to overdose on caffeine, she's doing something with words—be it writing, reading, or editing.

Monique Snyman lives in Pretoria, South Africa, with her husband, daughter, and an adorable Chihuahua. She's the author of the Bram Stoker Award® nominated novels, The Night Weaver and The Bone Carver, and the South African horror series, Dark Country . Visit moniquesnyman.com to find out more!

And it could have massive implications for Mars' volcanic past. 

If you dial the Psychic Reading number posted at the intersection of Webb Road and 13th Avenue, you will reach a woman in Lincoln.

Honey Miller is the person who operates Psychic Readings, which has offices in Lincoln and Grand Island.

She's had the office at the high-traffic Grand Island intersection for 10 or 15 years. Her location is at 115 in the Executive Suites strip mall, where the most prominent business is a State Farm office.

Psychic readings by Honey is located at 1233 N. Webb Road in Grand Island.

At her Lincoln office, she does more readings in person than over the phone.

Miller has been doing readings for a long time.

“I'm a third-generation psychic. This is the only thing I've ever done. I've never had any other kind of job,” she said.

Why should people call her?

“I don't like tooting my own horn,” she said. “I'm not that kind of person. But people do say my readings are accurate, and they enjoy being around me, and they enjoy my service.”

Many call her because they're “going through a hard time,” she said. They may have worries about a lot of things.

“And they need something to help them. They need a little clarity, a little guidance,” she said.

“Because some people don't have support, and even if they do have support, there's things that they don't feel comfortable telling just anybody about,” she said.

Psychic readings by Honey is located at 1233 N. Webb Road in Grand Island.

Many people want “to know how a certain situation's going to go. I do my best to help them with that.”

Many tell her they feel much better when they leave, she said. They feel their questions have been answered.

“They tell me that I'm kind, that it's like a pleasure to either talk to me or see me.”

Seeing her, they say, is like going to a friend.

All of her readings are private and confidential. She takes what she does very seriously, she says.

In addition to her own ability, Miller uses tarot cards and does palm readings. Crystal and crystal ball readings are also part of her arsenal. She does not do astrology.

Miller uses her Grand Island office only occasionally.

“I used to come there all the time. But since COVID, not as much.” She does plan to visit the Grand Island office more often.

She speaks fondly of the Grand Island office. “I like it there. The place has got a good energy.”

She knows that some people regard psychic reading as bunk.

How does she react to that?

“I'm going to be honest. I'm pretty tough-skinned,” she said.

Many people who contact her are skeptics. “But they don't leave skeptics.”

How long does a session last?

“It really depends on what reading the person chooses, because I have a lot of readings.”

How much does a psychic reading cost?

Sometimes Miller runs a special. “I'm not running the special right now, but my readings typically start at $15.”

The sign on her Grand Island door invites people to make an appointment. Her phone number is 308-850-8939.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","Joe Rogan doubles down on conspiracy theory over Donald Trump shooting incident","https://www.themirror.com/sport/other-sport/joe-rogan-doubles-down-conspiracy-1322532","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 12:08:00 GMT","

After initially cracking jokes about existing ""in the Matrix"" following the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, podcast host Joe Rogan later cautioned his audience that ""conspiracies are real"" while diving deeper into the shocking incident.

Rogan expressed disbelief at the glaring failures by the U.S. Secret Service that allowed Trump to be wounded in the ear and suggested there might be hidden elements to the story. Trump was targeted during a rally last summer in Butler, Pennsylvania, with the gunman later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks.

The attacker was eliminated by the Secret Service after his botched assassination bid, having opened fire with a rifle from a neighboring rooftop, though it has since emerged that multiple rally attendees alerted officials about Crooks' location after spotting him with a weapon. It comes after a bizarre close-up photo of Trump's ear caused a wave of new conspiracies one year after the shooting.

The FBI has been investigating Crooks and the July 13 events, while the Secret Service claimed in the aftermath it was conducting an internal examination. The episode has sparked numerous conspiracy theories, and Rogan confessed on his ""Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast that the pieces don't fit together perfectly.

""The more you read about it, the more you're, like, 'What is going on?'"" Rogan told comedian Sam Morril, who appeared as a guest on the program. ""They knew that there was a suspicious person 10 minutes before Trump went on stage; they still let him go on stage.

""They saw him on the ------- roof and they didn't engage. They saw him on the roof with a rifle. They wouldn't put Secret Service agents on the roof because they said there was a slope to the roof, and it would be dangerous.""

Morril then declared: ""It's more dangerous if the ex-president gets shot, which he did."" Rogan responded by saying: ""Dude, it's so crazy, and the fact that they had such poor security guarding him. Like, they did such a terrible job.""

Rogan then issued a warning by stating he wasn't suggesting an alternative theory but reminded his audience that he doesn't always trust the official government account. ""I'm not accusing anybody of anything - just want to be real clear - but they have organized assassinations before,"" Rogan added. ""And when they organize assassinations, it looks just like that.

""And when they organize assassinations, one of the things they like to do is have some ------- loser kill the president and then they kill the ------- loser, and that's a wrap. This kid kind of, like, stops all the leads.""

Rogan couldn't resist questioning why the authorities didn't stop Crooks, and even pondered the possibility of him being recruited. ""If you're Secret Service, you see someone with a range finder walking 150 yards from where the president is, you tackle that ------- guy. You don't let that guy get on a ladder,"" Rogan stated.

""If I was some shadowy intelligence agency that did these, you know, undercover operations that are a little sketchy, I'd find kids like [the shooter]. That's your moneymaker. That's how you do it. If you've got a plan and you want to do something, you get some guy that's basically got nothing going on in life and then you know you mentor him, become friends with him.

""Maybe that guy's dad is an alcoholic who beats [him]. You know, maybe his mom is a ------- junkie. Who knows? Maybe his life is terrible, and you can provide mentorship and you can provide, you know, just camaraderie. Something [to make the potential shooter say], 'Wow, I wish I was a secret agent.' And then you tell this guy, you tell this kid, 'Hey, you could help America. We can work you into the program. You could be one of us.'"".

Rogan's chat with Morril then shifted to another infamous presidential assassination, after John F. Kennedy was shot and killed back in 1963.

The Kennedy story is one of the most notorious conspiracy topics in U.S. history, and Rogan didn't hold back his thoughts on the matter.

""Listen, conspiracies are real,"" Rogan declared. ""I mean, whatever the ---- happened in Dallas, Texas, in 1963, it's not what they tell you. That's one thing; 100 percent you're going to be sure. There is no objective journalism with no slant.""

It comes after Rogan previously turned on Trump as a scandal engulfed his presidency.

The unsolved murder of 19-year-old Veronica Perotti continues to haunt her family and the community. Perotti was brutally beaten to death in her apartment on West Second Avenue on June 28, 1984.

Perotti, fondly known as “Roni” by her family, was a nursing student from Marin County. She was taking summer classes and preparing for her sophomore year when her life was tragically cut short.

Her mother, Jan Miller, became an advocate for other crime victims by helping to establish “Citizens Against Homicide.” Miller has tirelessly sought information about her daughter's murder, including posting billboards offering a $50,000 reward.

      Hello Evreyone,
    


      From a purely scientific perspective, and based on astronomical evidence, I believe that intelligent life beyond Earth is not a product of science fiction, but a strong possibility supported by the facts of the universe itself. We live in a cosmos containing hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars, many accompanied by planets and regions that could potentially support life. Given such vastness, the probability that we are the only intelligent beings in existence is extremely small.
    


      Yet I have an unshakable curiosity: if the day comes when visitors from other worlds knock on Earth's door, will we truly be ready to welcome them?
    


      We humans still face difficulties in coexistence in some parts of our world, as conflicts continue to divide certain regions. So how would we interact with beings fundamentally different from us in biology, communication methods, social systems—and perhaps even in logic and reasoning?
    


      This raises critical questions: Who would establish the ""Coexistence Agreement""?
    


      Would such an agreement be shaped by the great powers, or by the alien visitors themselves?
    


      And would the other party even agree to it, or instead impose its own terms?
    


      What if these beings possessed moral values or technologies far beyond our own?
    


      This discussion is not for random speculation, but for exchanging ideas, exploring possible scenarios, and examining scientific projections for such an encounter—whether we view it as a bridge to unprecedented cosmic cooperation, or as the start of existential challenges that could reshape the course of human civilization.

            Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed on Tuesday not to give eastern Ukrainian land to Russia, saying that abandoning the Donbas region would open the door for Russian President Vladimir Putin to “start a third war” in Ukraine.
    


            Zelensky's warning comes ahead of Putin's meeting with US President Donald Trump in Alaska on Friday, where the Russian president is expected to demand Ukrainian land as part of a peace deal.
    


            While there is confusion over Putin's reported conditions for a ceasefire, most versions stress that the Russian president will demand that Ukrainian forces withdraw from all parts of Ukraine's Donbas, which includes parts of the Donetsk region it still holds.
    


            “For the Russians, Donbas is a springboard for a future new offensive. If we leave Donbas of our own accord or under pressure, we will start a third war,” Zelensky said in a meeting with journalists. Russia illegally annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014, and went on to launch its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
    


            “I am not going to surrender my country because I have no right to do so,” he added. “If we leave Donbas today, our fortifications, our terrain, the heights we control, we will clearly open a bridgehead for the preparation of a Russian offensive.”
    


Russian troops pierce Ukraine's patchy defenses in Donetsk, days before Trump-Putin summit



            Zelensky and Ukrainian military officials have warned that Russia is building up troops for a new offensive, ready to launch by September.
    


            “I haven't heard anything — not a single proposal that would guarantee that a new war won't start tomorrow and that Putin won't try to occupy at least Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv,” the Ukrainian president told reporters.
    


            “The exchange of territories is a very complex issue that cannot be separated from security guarantees for Ukraine, for our sovereign state and our people,” Zelensky added, noting that the European Union's involvement in peace talks is also crucial because “no one except Europe is giving us security guarantees.”
    


            A conversation between the US, Ukraine and “all of Europe” will take place on Wednesday, according to the Ukrainian president.
    


            Trump has signaled Zelensky would not participate in Friday's summit, though the US president previewed his plans to phone Kyiv immediately after the meeting, along with other European leaders, to brief them.
    


Panic in eastern Ukraine as Trump entertains idea of giving parts of it to Russia



Trump said his goal is ultimately to get Putin and Zelensky in the same room to hash out their differences, and surmised only they would be able to find a way to end the war with some “land swapping” between them.
    


            “I'm not going to make a deal,” Trump said. “It's not up to me to make a deal. I think a deal should be made for both.”
    


            The White House on Tuesday characterized the upcoming meeting between Trump and Putin in Anchorage as a “listening exercise.”
    


            “Only one party that's involved in this war is going to be present, and so this is for the president to go and to get, again, a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.
    


            Asked by CNN's Kaitlan Collins whether the two presidents would meet one-on-one, Leavitt said that is “part of the plan.”
    


            Zelensky also gave further details on Tuesday about the diplomatic talks that have been taking place behind the scenes, as well as his take on the outcome of US special envoy Steve Witkoff's meeting with Putin.
    


            “Witkoff said that there should be territorial concessions on both sides. That's how it sounded. And that Putin probably wants us to leave Donbas. So it didn't sound like America wants us to leave,” Zelensky said. “I do not believe that Putin's proposal is Trump's proposal. I believe that Trump represents the United States of America. He acts as a mediator, he is in the middle – not on Russia's side.”

            Artificial intelligence search company Perplexity has made an unsolicited, $34.5 billion offer to purchase Google's Chrome browser, a surprise move by a Google Search challenger that's looking to upend how people find information online.
    


            Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer confirmed to CNN the details of the offer, which The Wall Street Journal first reported.
    


            The bid comes as Google awaits a court's decision after a landmark ruling last year found that the internet giant had violated US antitrust law with its search business. The US Justice Department has proposed as a remedy that Google sell its Chrome browser.
    


            Google has promised to appeal the ruling and called the idea of spinning off Chrome an “unprecedented proposal” that it says would harm consumers and security. Google declined to provide a comment to CNN regarding Perplexity's bid.
    


            Perplexity's offer — while likely a long shot, given Google's resistance to a forced sale of Chrome — marks the latest example of how new firms are taking on tech's biggest players to reshape the internet in the AI era.
    


            Perplexity is a nearly three-year-old startup whose search tool uses AI models to parse web content and curate answers. Answers are usually posted as a summary, although Perplexity does provide links to its sources. It launched an AI search engine that competes with Google's dominant offering in December 2022.
    


AI search firm Perplexity makes $34.5 billion surprise bid for Google Chrome



            Perplexity launched its own AI-powered web browser called Comet in July. The company is pitching it as a more personalized browser that connects the dots between a user's calendars, browsing tabs, social channels and more. OpenAI is also said to be developing a web browser, according to Reuters, in yet another signal that AI companies are looking to play a bigger role in how people use the web.
    


            Perplexity said it would maintain users' current browsing preferences, including Google as the default search engine, if it were to buy Chrome, Dwyer told CNN.
    


            It would also commit to “continued available and support” for Chrome for 100 months and investing $3 billion in Chromium over the next 24 months, according to Dwyer. Chromium is Google's open-source underlying technology that other tech companies – including Microsoft and Perplexity – can use to build their own browsers.
    


            Perplexity made the offer because it “believes in the open web,” Dwyer said.
    


            Perplexity was most recently valued at $18 billion following a $100 million funding round, Bloomberg said in a report last month, citing a person familiar with the matter. The company did not comment on the report.
    


            That makes Perplexity's offer for Chrome worth nearly double its own valuation. Google, meanwhile, is worth nearly $2.5 trillion; shares of the company (GOOGL) rose around 1% on Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal reported that several investors have agreed to back the purchase, including large venture capital firms.
    


            “This is a smart and opportunistic move by Perplexity given the case against Google and regulatory scrutiny,” Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told CNN, adding that he estimates Chrome is worth at least $50 billion. “This is all a game of high stakes poker and Perplexity made a good move.”
    


            Google Chrome isn't the only high profile acquisition target that Perplexity has pursued. The company said earlier this year it was making a bid to buy TikTok, after a law was passed last year requiring the social media app's parent company, ByteDance, to sell it to a non-China-based company or face a ban in the United States.
    


            Perplexity has also reportedly been eyeballed by bigger tech players — both Meta and Apple have had discussions about buying the AI search firm, according to reports from Bloomberg and The Information, although it's not clear the talks will go anywhere.

European Union staff are in a standoff with the European Commission over their right to protest its stance on Israel, accusing the bloc of breaching their moral and legal obligations, Politico has reported.

The civil servants say the EU's position on the Gaza war puts them in violation of European and international law, the outlet cited unnamed officials from the bloc as saying on Tuesday.

One official said “complicity” has been imposed on employees, violating their “moral and legal obligations, suppressed conscientious resistance and delayed meaningful action.” 

Since late July, around 1,500 officials have reportedly signed an open letter warning of worsening humanitarian conditions in Gaza and a surge in starvation-related deaths unless more aid is allowed. Some have considered picketing, although the labor unions remain divided and the legal implications are unclear. 

An internal group has alleged “intimidation” tactics against protesters, including the removal of staff, forced deletion of videos, and non-renewal of contracts. 

A Commission spokesperson said EU foreign policy is set by national governments and that civil servants must remain neutral, adding that the workplace is not a venue for activism. 

Rights groups have accused the bloc of indirectly backing Israel's war by maintaining arms exports, preferential trade, and joint research projects – despite its own diplomats finding Israel in breach of human rights clauses.

Humanitarian agencies say that from early March to May, aid deliveries to Gaza were completely blocked off. The UN has reported that convoys continue to face obstruction and looting, warning by late July of “mounting evidence” of famine, with images of severely malnourished children circulating worldwide.

Last week, West Jerusalem approved a plan to seize Gaza City, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisting it was the only way to secure the release of Hamas-held hostages and demilitarize the enclave. His remarks have resulted in widespread criticism and domestic protests.

Around 50 hostages remain unaccounted for in Gaza, with only about 20 believed to be alive. Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, killing some 1,200 people and abducting 251 more. Since then, more than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in West Jerusalem's military campaign, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

ISTANBUL, August 12. /TASS/. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has told Vladimir Zelensky that his country is ready to host a summit on Ukraine, the Turkish president's administration said after the two held a phone call.

""Turkey is ready to host a leaders' summit. The establishment of working groups on military, humanitarian, and political issues will open up a path to a summit meeting,"" Erdogan was quoted as saying.

""President Erdogan held a phone call with Vladimir Zelensky at the Ukrainian side's request. He noted that the progress that has been reached during the direct Ukraine-Russia talks in Istanbul is crucially important and expressed hope that the next rounds of talks will yield significant results toward a ceasefire and a lasting peace,"" Erdogan's office said.

The Turkish leader all voiced support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Istanbul hosted the third round of direct Russian-Ukrainian talks on July 23. During the 40-minute talks that were preceded by a tete-a-tete meeting between the delegation heads, Vladimir Medinsky of Russia and Rustem Umerov of Ukraine, the sides discussed their positions laid down in their memorandums.

The meeting yielded an agreement to exchange not only military but also civilians. Russia proposed to set up three working groups to address political, military, and humanitarian issues. Apart from that, Moscow offered Kiev to transfer 3,000 more bodies of Ukrainian troops and suggested that the practice of short humanitarian pauses be resumed along the frontline to collect the wounded and bodies of those killed.

According to Medinsky, a decision on the fourth round of talks will be made after the third round's agreements are implemented.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Trump forwarded a false narrative around DC crime stats to justify the move. Plus, funeral held in Gaza for five journalists killed by Israeli attack

Good morning.

Donald Trump has ordered the national guard to Washington DC and seized control of the city's police force, describing a “lawless” city in ways that are sharply at odds with official crime statistics.

The president's move was swiftly condemned as a “disgusting, dangerous and derogatory” assault on the political independence of a racially diverse city. The federal takeover is expected to be in effect for 30 days, the White House confirmed to the Guardian.

Speaking at a White House press conference on Monday, Trump alleged DC was “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the world”, even though violent crime is at a 30-year low.

What do the crime figures tell us? That Trump is spreading a false narrative about DC crime – just as he did with LA. Violent crime in DC is at a 30-year low. In January, the Metropolitan police department and US attorney's office released a report indicating that total violent crime in DC in 2024 was down 35% from the previous year, marking the lowest rate in over 30 years.

How are Democrats responding? Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic minority leader in the House, described Trump as a “wannabe king” and said: “We stand with the residents of the District of Columbia and reject this unjustified power grab as illegitimate.”

The death of the prominent Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif, killed along with four colleagues in an Israeli airstrike on Sunday, prompted condemnation from around the world, as hundreds of mourners carried their bodies through the streets of Gaza City.

Sharif, one of Al Jazeera's most recognisable faces in Gaza, was killed while inside a tent for journalists outside al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on Sunday night. Seven people were killed in the attack, including the Al Jazeera correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and the camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa, according to the Qatar-based broadcaster.

How deadly has the war been for journalists? Before Sunday's airstrike, the Committee to Protect Journalists recorded at least 186 journalists and media workers killed in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel and Lebanon since the war began, making it the deadliest period for journalists since it began gathering data in 1992. The CPJ accuses Israel of directly targeting and killing 20 journalists and media workers. Any deliberate attack on a civilian could constitute a war crime, experts say. Israel, which has refused to let international media into Gaza, denies the accusation.

Donald Trump has announced he is nominating EJ Antoni, the chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, as the next commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The nomination comes after Trump fired the BLS commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, earlier this month following the release of a weak jobs report.

Trump, without evidence, alleged McEntarfer “faked” employment numbers in the run-up to the 2024 election to boost Kamala Harris's chances and said that the recent data was “rigged” to make Trump and Republicans look bad.

What happens next? The Senate will have to confirm Antoni's nomination to lead the BLS, an independent agency under the labor department. Experts fear Trump's interventions will undermine the credibility of the agency's economic data, long seen as a gold standard.

Donald Trump said he and Vladimir Putin would discuss “land swapping” when they meet on Friday in Alaska for a summit on the Ukraine war, and expressed frustration with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Meanwhile, Trump again delayed implementing sweeping tariffs on China, announcing another 90-day pause hours before the last agreement expired.

An explosion at a US Steel plant in Pennsylvania killed two people and injured at least 10 on Monday. “It felt like thunder,” said one worker near the scene.

Spain's central government has ordered officials in a Spanish town to scrap a ban on religious gatherings in public sports centers, describing it as a “discriminatory” measure mainly affecting Muslims.

Villagers whose farms in Vietnam will be bulldozed to make way for a $1.5bn golf resort backed by the Trump family have reportedly been offered rice provisions and cash compensation of as little as $12 for a square meter of land by state authorities. Thousands of villagers will be offered compensation based on land size and location, according to a report by Reuters.

Anas al-Sharif, an Al Jazeera reporter, was killed by an Israeli airstrike on Sunday night. Before his killing, he prepared a message for his family, and calling for the world not to forget Gaza. “I have lived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification,” he writes.

Anas al-Sharif, a reporter previously threatened by Israel, and four colleagues were killed in an Israeli airstrike. 

Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera's reporter Anas al-Sharif and four of his colleagues were killed on Sunday in an Israeli strike near Shifa Hospital in eastern Gaza City, according to Gaza officials and the network.

The network said the 28-year-old journalist had been previously threatened by Israel.

The Israeli military has claimed that al-Sharif headed a Hamas cell, an allegation Al Jazeera has rejected.

Gaza health officials and Al Jazeera said the journalists were killed when an Israeli missile hit a tent near the hospital. An official at Shifa said two other people were also killed.

""Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif has been killed alongside four colleagues in a targeted Israeli attack on a tent housing journalists in Gaza City,"" the Qatar-based broadcaster said.

It said he ""was killed on Sunday after a tent for journalists outside the main gate of the hospital was hit.""

The other Al Jazeera journalists killed were Mohammed Qreiqeh, Ibrahim Zaher and Mohammed Noufal.

Minutes before his death, al-Sharif, whose X account had more than 500,000 followers, posted on the platform that Israel had been intensely bombarding Gaza City for more than two hours.

Al-Sharif had worked as a prominent correspondent for Al Jazeera and was previously part of a photography team for the Reuters news agency that won the 2024 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography for coverage of the Israel-Hamas war.

He was described by the network as ""one of Gaza's bravest journalists"" and a vital voice in reporting on the war. His coverage often included interviews with residents directly affected by the fighting, as well as footage from sites immediately after Israeli strikes.

A press freedom group and a United Nations expert had previously warned that al-Sharif's life was at risk due to his reporting from Gaza. UN Special Rapporteur Irene Khan said last month that Israel's claims against him were unsubstantiated.

Al Jazeera said al-Sharif had left a social media message to be posted in the event of his death, saying he had ""never hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or misrepresentation, hoping that God would witness those who remained silent.""

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said al-Sharif was ""responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops,"" alleging he led a Hamas cell.

It cited intelligence and documents found in Gaza with a list of people linked to Hamas and the Islamic Jihad militant groups as evidence. 

Both Al Jazeera and al-Sharif had previously dismissed the accusations as baseless.

Germany has pressed Israel for a full and transparent explanation over the killing of Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza. 

""Israel is now expected, from our perspective, to explain itself in the most transparent and comprehensible manner possible,"" a spokesperson for the German Foreign Office told the German press agency dpa, while calling the killing of media workers ""absolutely unacceptable"" under international humanitarian law."" 

The UN human rights office on Monday condemned the killing of at least five Palestinian journalists in Gaza, saying the actions by Israel's military represented a ""grave breach of international humanitarian law.""

""Israel must respect and protect all civilians, including journalists,"" it added.

The post on social media platform X was accompanied by a photograph showing flattened blue tents next to a bullet-ridden wall in Gaza City.

The Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate described al-Sharif's death as a ""bloody crime"" of assassination.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it was ""appalled"" by the killing, denying the Israeli military's claims that al-Sharif had ties to Hamas.

""Israel has a longstanding, documented pattern of accusing journalists of being terrorists without providing any credible proof,"" the CPJ said Monday. 

In July, the CPJ had urged the international community to protect al-Sharif, saying in a statement that Israel had failed to provide any evidence to back up its allegations against him.

In the statement, the CPJ accused Israel of targeting him in a smear campaign.

""Israel's pattern of labeling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,"" Sara Qudah, CPJ's director for the Middle East and North Africa, said on Monday.

Reporters Without Borders (RSF) says the targeting of journalists in Gaza has created an ""information blackout"" in some areas.

Al Jazeera called the attack ""a desperate attempt to silence voices in anticipation of the occupation of Gaza"" and urged international accountability.

Al Jazeera remains blocked in Israel, where soldiers raided and shut its West Bank offices last year.

In July, RSF said more than 200 journalists had been killed by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip, accusing Israel of war crimes. A month earlier, the CPJ had said that 178 reporters had died in the war.

Meanwhile, the Hamas-run Gaza government media office has said that 238 journalists have been killed since the war started in October 2023.

According to the US Brown University's Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs' Costs of War project, the conflict is the deadliest on record for journalists.  

The institute said the war had killed more reporters than the US Civil War, World Wars I and II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s and 2000s and the post-9/11 war in Afghanistan, combined.

• Looking ahead: Meanwhile, Trump will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin one-on-one in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday, according to the White House, which characterized the summit as a “listening exercise” on the war in Ukraine.
    


            It's a busy week for President Donald Trump as the administration's asserts its control of Washington, DC's Metropolitan Police Department while the US leader prepares for a meeting Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            If you're just joining us, here's what you need to know:
    


Federal control of DC police:

            DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro was pressed today on what changes she'd like to see when it comes to sentencing and punishment for those who commit the crimes in the city. She was also asked what she can do in her position under the Trump administration's federal takeover of DC.
    


            “I don't have any special powers. I wish I did,” Pirro said.
    


            The Trump administration has continued to deny statistics that the overall crime rates in DC have decreased over the past year, which Pirro also addressed.
    


                    “Anyone who wants to tell me the crime is down and that we don't need an emergency focus on crimes of violence, all they need to do is take a look at this and talk to the loved ones and the family members of these individuals all shot and killed,” Pirro said.
                





            She was asked about DC crime during a news conference announcing an indictment against Haitian gang leader Jimmy Cherizier, also known as “Barbecue.”
    


            The DC Metropolitan Police Department will seek to dismantle any remaining homeless encampments in the district, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters today.
    


            Those who don't comply and move to homeless shelters or addiction or mental health services “will be susceptible to fines or jail time,” she added.
    


            Leavitt cited the MPD's authority under local laws to clear the city's homeless encampments, telling reporters, “these are pre-existing laws that are already on the books.”
    


                    “They have not been enforced, which is part of the reason for this nationalizing of the National Guard, to bring in this assistance for law enforcement while we are targeting criminals and trying to remove criminals off of the streets,” she said. “We also want to make DC safe and beautiful, and that involves removing mentally disturbed individuals and homeless encampments as well.”
                





            She touted the work US Parks Police have done to break up homeless encampments across the city, telling reporters that 70 have been removed from the city's parks since March, with the remaining two slated for this week.
    


            And the press secretary said the administration is “exploring” how to move homeless people “FAR from the Capital” as Trump suggested in a Truth Social post Monday.
    


                    “We're exploring how we could do that — but again, homeless shelters, offered addiction and mental health services, or jail if they refuse, are the options on the table right now, and we'll continue to explore that option,” she said.
                





            The head of the Drug and Enforcement Administration is functionally “in charge” of Washington, DC's Metropolitan Police Department during the Trump administration's takeover of law enforcement within the city, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said today.
    


            President Donald Trump tapped Terrance Cole as interim federal commissioner of the DC Metropolitan Police Department.
    


            “Terry Cole, as you heard from this briefing room yesterday, is in charge of the Metropolitan Police Department, and he's working with the chief to ensure that law enforcement officers are allowed to do their jobs in this city,” Leavitt told CNN's Kaitlan Collins.
    


            The assertion came after DC leaders signaled they did not expect significant organizational changes at the department because of the federal takeover, while vowing to work with their federal partners and seeking to downplay any controversy.
    


Earlier today: When asked if she answered to Cole, MPD Police Chief Pamela Smith responded, “I answer to Mayor Muriel Bowser.”
    


            And Bowser said, “Our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, how we make changes — none of that has changed.”
    


            Leavitt characterized Cole as tasked with working with Smith, adding that both of them would report up to Attorney General Pam Bondi for the duration of the 30-day federal takeover.
    


            She also declined to rule out the possibility of firing DC police officers, while noting that there are no current plans to do so.
    


            “I would imagine it means they have the ability,” Leavitt said of the potential for personnel changes. “As for any changes, I'm not tracking any.”
    


            President Donald Trump will meet one-on-one with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of their summit on Friday in Alaska, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN during the press briefing today.
    


            Trump expects to focus squarely on ending the war in Ukraine, leaving other issues the Kremlin has said could be up for discussion — including normalizing US-Russia ties — for another time.
    


Why this matters: Trump and Putin have met individually, without aides, previously. In 2017, they met alone during their first encounter at the G20 summit in Hamburg. Then in 2018, they sat one-on-one in Helsinki, Finland, after which Trump sided with Putin over US intelligence agencies on the question of Russian election interference.
    


            Both encounters included translators but not high-ranking aides. After the Germany meeting, Trump reportedly asked his translator for his notes.
    


            It's not atypical for leaders to meet alone with their counterparts, but Trump and Putin's relationship has been the subject of intense scrutiny. And during Trump's first term, even senior officials said they sometimes were left in the dark about what was discussed when aides were left out.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov today discussed the upcoming meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, according to Russia's foreign ministry.
    


            Rubio and Lavrov spoke about “certain aspects of preparation” for the meeting, which will take place on Friday in Alaska, the Russian foreign ministry said.
    


            “Both sides confirmed their commitment to a successful meeting,” it said.
    


            The US State Department also released a readout of the conversation with similar details.
    


The post has been updated with confirmation of the discussion from the US State Department.



            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that President Donald Trump is mainly focused “making DC safe and beautiful again,” when asked about his remarks about crime in other cities in the country.
    


            Trump called out Chicago, New York and Los Angeles for their crime rates when he announced his plans to take control of the DC Metropolitan Police Department yesterday.
    


                    “Look, the president is speaking about what he'd like to see take place in other cities around the country,” Leavitt told reporters. “Right now, this administration is focused on making DC safe and beautiful again … but I will note that the president wants to see all of our nation's cities be safe. But I think starting with our nation's capital is a great place to begin, and it should serve as a model for the rest of the country.”
                





For context: Memphis, Cleveland and St. Louis have the highest overall crime rates among US cities with a population of at least 250,000, according to the FBI's Crime Database. Washington, DC, is ranked 10th.
    


            Memphis, Detroit and Baltimore top the database for violent crime rates among cities of at least 250,000 people, while Washington, DC, ranks 17th.
    


            These numbers rely on reporting from local jurisdictions and are not exhaustive of all crime that occurs.
    


The CNN FactCheck team contributed reporting to this post. 



            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it was “unfortunate” that a federal judge this week rejected the Trump administration's efforts to unseal grand jury materials relating to Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking case.
    


            “We think that decision is unfortunate. Of course, we moved to unseal that information because the president has said he wants to see credible evidence released,” Leavitt said at today's White House briefing.
    


            Leavitt deferred to the Department of Justice when asked if the administration plans to appeal.
    


            President Donald Trump is traveling to Anchorage for a bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said as she nodded to the fact that Ukraine will not be represented.
    


            The logistics of the event, including timing and plans for a potential joint press conference, are “still being ironed out,” she told reporters at today's White House press briefing.
    


            The White House characterized President Donald Trump's upcoming meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “listening exercise,” appearing to downplay expectations for a peace deal heading into the high-stakes summit in Alaska on Friday.
    


                    “This is a listening exercise for the president. Look, only one party that's involved in this war is going to be present, and so this is for the president to go and to get, again, a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end,” Leavitt told reporters at the White House briefing.
                





            “Sitting face to face, rather than speaking over the telephone, will give this president the best indication of how to end this war and where this is headed,” she said.
    


            President Donald Trump is considering “suing” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said today.
    


            This comes after Trump posted on Truth Social earlier in the day that he was “considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed.”
    


            Leavitt declined to elaborate further, deferring to Trump.
    


            President Donald Trump's order to take control of Washington, DC's Metropolitan Police Department will be reevaluated in 30 days, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.
    


            Asked about the timeline of Trump's efforts, Leavitt said:
    


                    “As for the timing, we will reevaluate and reassess and make further decisions after this 30-day period is up, but within these 30 days, our entire focus is making sure that this is the most efficient operation possible.”
                





            Trump can retain control for 30 days if he notifies certain members of Congress, which he has done. Any request of over 30 days must be passed into law.
    


            The press secretary added that the administration's focus will be to clean up DC “as best we can” and that it will work with the MPD to do so.
    


            More than 20 people were arrested in Washington, DC, yesterday following the deployment of hundreds of officers and agents after President Donald Trump declared a crime emergency in the city, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.
    


            “Approximately 850 officers and agents were surged across the city. They made a total of 23 arrests, including multiple other contacts last night,” Leavitt told reporters at the the White House.
    


            Leavitt said people were arrested for “homicide, firearms offenses, possession with intent to distribute, narcotics, fare evasion, lewd acts, stalking, possession of a high capacity magazine …  driving under the influence, reckless driving and a bench warrant.”
    


            The press secretary said authorities also seized six illegal handguns as well.
    


            Leavitt said the administration will continue its efforts over the next month to “relentlessly pursue and arrest every violent criminal in the district who breaks the law, undermines public safety and endangers law-abiding Americans.”
    


For context: Crime, violence and guns landed at the top of the list when DC residents were asked to name the biggest problem facing the District today in a Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted this spring. The poll suggests, though, that the sense of crime as a major problem is down from recent years.
    


Overall violent crime numbers are lower in the nation's capital after a spike in 2023.

            President Donald Trump is participating in virtual Ukraine talks tomorrow, a White House official told CNN.
    


            German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said yesterday he was planning to host a virtual meeting with Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders to discuss the war in Ukraine.
    


            It comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday.
    


CNN's Christian Edwards contributed reporting. 



            Washington, DC, councilmember Brooke Pinto said that deploying the National Guard is “not the answer” to reducing crime in the city, as local leaders and Democrats push back on the Trump administration's enforcement crackdown.
    


            Pinto also voiced support for Mayor Muriel Bowser and DC Police Chief Pamela Smith during an interview on CNN, urging them to “make sure” that the administration's takeover of city resources “doesn't last longer than 30 days,” as outlined in the president's executive order.
    


                    “If these folks are going to be here in addition to our city, we want to make sure it is helpful to our efforts of crime fighting and not harmful,” Pinto said of the elevated federal law enforcement presence.
                





            During the interview, Pinto acknowledged crime concerns with pushback on what she characterized as a heavy-handed response from the Trump administration.
    


            “I'm proud of the progress that we've made leading to this 30-year low of violent crime. But I am also the first to say we have to do more — reality and safety have to be true for everyone in DC, and we take seriously our responsibility here that we're also the nation's capital,” Pinto said.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi released a statement on X following her meeting this morning with Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser.
    


            Bondi said in the statement that she and Bowser agreed to keep tourists and residents in the city safe from “deadly crime” and that they will continue to work closely together to carry out the president's orders.
    


            However, there is no additional clarity on leadership structure or missions of the federal intervention.
    


                    “I just concluded a productive meeting with DC @MayorBowser at the Department of Justice. We agreed that there is nothing more important than keeping residents and tourists in Washington, D.C. safe from deadly crime. At President Trump's direction, @TheJusticeDept will work closely with D.C. city government and @DCPoliceDept to make Washington, D.C. safe again,” Bondi wrote. 
                





            Bowser said that Bondi will be serving as President Donald Trump's proxy to implement his executive order.
    


            Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser said that she's focused on maximizing the surge of federal law enforcement ordered by President Donald Trump rather than dwelling on the circumstances surrounding the situation.
    


            “What I'm focused on is the federal surge and how to make the most of the additional officer support that we have. We have the best in the business in (the Metropolitan Police Department) in Chief Pamela Smith to lead that effort and to make sure that the men and women who are coming from federal law enforcement are being well used … all in an effort to drive down crime,” Bowser told reporters.
    


                    The mayor added that no matter “how we got here or what we think about the circumstances, right now we have more police and we want to make sure we're using them.”
                





            Bowser also said that Attorney General Pam Bondi will be serving as Trump's proxy to implement his order.
    


            “The executive order is clear. The president has requested MPD services, and our Home Rule Charter outlines the process. The president designated Attorney General Bondi as his proxy to request services through me,” Bowser said.
    


            Bowser noted that the organizational chart of how her office and the Metropolitan Police Department work together will remain unchanged.
    


                    “Our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, how we make changes — none of that has changed,” she said.
                





            Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith told reporters she met with Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terrance Cole and United States Marshals Service Director Gadyaces “Gady” Serralta yesterday and today to discuss President Donald Trump's order to take control of the city's police department.
    


                    “We have been working collaboratively. I think it's going to be a good effort. It's going to be an effort that's supported by both teams. The Metropolitan Police Department as well as our federal partners,” Smith said outside the Justice Department.
                





            Cole was tapped as interim federal commissioner of the DC Metropolitan Police Department.
    


            She said that the MPD has provided Cole with a “strategic plan on how we will provide resources around our city.”
    


            She added city officials know that they need to get illegal guns off the streets and the “enhanced presence” of federal law enforcement and resources in the city will help make the city “even better.”
    


            Asked who she responds to amid the federal takeover of DC police, Smith said:
    


                    “I answer to Mayor Muriel Bowser.” 
                





            Additional Department of Justice officials attended the meeting with DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and Attorney General Pam Bondi.
    


            They include:
    


            President Donald Trump will meet with South Korea President Lee Jae Myung on August 25, a White House official told CNN today.
    


            The South Korean leader's upcoming visit to Washington comes on the heels of a July trade deal in which the US agreed to reduce its reciprocal tariff on South Korean goods from a proposed 25% to 15%.
    


            The lower rate also applies to South Korean automobiles, one of the country's top exports to the United States. As part of the deal, South Korea committed to purchasing $100 billion in US energy and investing in the American economy.
    


            Lee took office on June 4.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis tapped Republican state Sen. Jay Collins to be his next lieutenant governor Tuesday. It's a closely watched appointment by the two-term governor, who can't run for reelection in 2026 and has been working to cement his legacy as his time leading the state winds down.

If Collins, an Army combat veteran and nonprofit executive, decides to launch a bid to succeed DeSantis, the move could tee up another proxy fight between the popular GOP governor and President Donald Trump, who has already endorsed U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds for the job. 

During a news conference announcing his pick at the Green Beret Association in Tampa on Tuesday, DeSantis praised Collins as an “ally” and a principled conservative.

“What I was looking for is someone that can be lieutenant governor that will help us deliver more wins for the people of Florida — and then also that is capable of serving and leading as governor, if that need were ever to arise,” the governor said during the news conference in Tampa, which Collins represents.

Collins was sworn in minutes after the announcement, with his wife Layla and their two young sons at his side, while the governor and first lady Casey DeSantis looked on.

Collins pledged to help deliver on DeSantis' agenda, which he said has made Florida the country's “conservative proving grounds.”

“The goal is to help him finish the mission and keep Florida strong,” Collins said of DeSantis, adding, “you don't flinch when the next mission comes up. You just say, ‘Yes, sir. Let's go.'”




Born in Montana, Collins has talked openly about personal challenges he has overcome, including experiencing homelessness while in high school. He went on to join the Army Special Forces and ultimately lost a leg, but continued to serve five more years as a Green Beret using a prosthetic leg post-amputation, according to a campaign biography. 

Taking the stage Tuesday, Collins made light of the injury he sustained, saying he was proud to serve the country that afforded him so many opportunities.

“I want you to know that I've got my sleeves rolled up, I've got my running leg on, and we are ready to get things done,” Collins said.

In recent years, Collins has served as the chief operating officer of Operation BBQ Relief, which deploys cooks and mobile kitchens to deliver hot meals in the aftermath of natural disasters. In June, Collins also flew to Israel to help support state-funded flights to evacuate Americans as Israel and Iran traded missile strikes.

“Why would you want to go in to Israel when Iran is raining rockets down? Most people would take a pass on that,” DeSantis said of Collins, calling him “the Chuck Norris of Florida politics.”

The seat had been vacant since February, when then-lieutenant governor Jeanette Nuñez was appointed to lead one of the state's public universities. In Florida, the lieutenant governor position is largely ceremonial with few official responsibilities, apart from taking over if the governor cannot serve.

Collins was first elected to Florida's Republican-dominated state Senate in 2022 and has been seen as one of DeSantis' key allies in the Legislature. In recent months, GOP legislators loyal to the president have increasingly sparred with the governor, who challenged Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.

The appointment is seen as a way for DeSantis to elevate a potential successor in 2026, though the governor has repeatedly talked up his wife, Casey DeSantis, for the job, while taking shots at Trump's pick.

YouTube on Wednesday will begin testing a new age-verification system in the U.S. that relies on artificial intelligence to differentiate between adults and minors, based on the kinds of videos that they have been watching.

The tests initially will only affect a sliver of YouTube's audience in the U.S., but it will likely become more pervasive if the system works as well at guessing viewers' ages as it does in other parts of the world. The system will only work when viewers are logged into their accounts, and it will make its age assessments regardless of the birth date a user might have entered upon signing up.

If the system flags a logged-in viewer as being under 18, YouTube will impose the normal controls and restrictions that the site already uses as a way to prevent minors from watching videos and engaging in other behavior deemed inappropriate for that age.

The safeguards include reminders to take a break from the screen, privacy warnings and restrictions on video recommendations. YouTube, which has been owned by Google for nearly 20 years, also doesn't show ads tailored to individual tastes if a viewer is under 18. 

If the system has inaccurately called out a viewer as a minor, the mistake can be corrected by showing YouTube a government-issued identification card, a credit card or a selfie.

“YouTube was one of the first platforms to offer experiences designed specifically for young people, and we're proud to again be at the forefront of introducing technology that allows us to deliver safety protections while preserving teen privacy,” James Beser, the video service's director of product management, wrote in a blog post about the age-verification system.




People still will be able to watch YouTube videos without logging into an account, but viewing that way triggers an automatic block on some content without proof of age.

The political pressure has been building on websites to do a better job of verifying ages to shield children from inappropriate content since late June when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a Texas law aimed at preventing minors from watching pornography online.

While some services, such as YouTube, have been stepping up their efforts to verify users' ages, others have contended that the responsibility should primarily fall upon the two main smartphone app stores run by Apple and Google — a position that those two technology powerhouses have resisted.

Some digital rights groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy & Technology, have raised concerns that age verification could infringe on personal privacy and violate First Amendment protections on free speech.

Fox News correspondent Alexandria Hoff has the latest on how the Justice Department will run Washington, D.C.'s police force on 'Special Report.'

A crowd rental company has seen a massive uptick in inquiries regarding its services in Washington, D.C., amid President Donald Trump's move to federalize the police force in the nation's capital. 

""Right now, D.C. inquiries are up roughly 400% compared to the same period in 2024,"" Crowds on Demand CEO Adam Swart told Fox News Digital, adding that the time period he is referencing is May to July 2024. 

The company always sees a spike in requests during what Swart calls ""high-stakes political moments.""

TRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS—BUT SOME WELCOME IT

""A large share are focused on opposing Trump's policies in Washington and raising alarms about government overreach,"" Swart said. ""We're weighing those offers carefully – because while there's truth in saying D.C.'s local government has been an abject failure in keeping citizens safe, there's also a real danger in putting too much power in federal hands. That balance of power matters."" 

Swart said the ""vast majority"" of people at political or advocacy events in D.C. are in some way paid. 

""Most people don't know this, but many protesters are literally on the payroll – Capitol Hill staffers from both parties are often expected to show up at rallies and protests on their own time,"" he said. ""So yes, most attendees are being paid or are there because it's part of their job. That doesn't mean they don't support the cause – but it does mean these crowds aren't as ‘organic' as they appear on TV.""

TRUMP CLAIMS DC CRIMES TROUNCE STATS FROM NOTORIOUSLY VIOLENT CITIES WORLDWIDE

On Monday, Trump announced that District of Columbia National Guard troops will be activated to patrol the streets in Washington, and that the federal government will take control of the Metropolitan Police Department. 

Trump cited unchecked violent crime as the reason for the takeover, which he announced a week after former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer Edward Coristine and his girlfriend were subject to an attempted carjacking on Aug. 3. Coristine was left beaten and bloodied. 

Upon learning of Coristine's victimization, Trump first floated the idea in a post on his TRUTH Social platform.

He said criminals in the city are not afraid of the police because ""nothing ever happens to them.""

""The most recent victim was beaten mercilessly by local thugs,"" Trump wrote. ""… Perhaps it should have been done a long time ago, then this incredible young man, and so many others, would not have had to go through the horrors of Violent Crime. If this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""

Shohei Ohtani and his agent were hit with a lawsuit by a real estate investor and broker in Hawaii, claiming they got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development by using their celebrity status.

The Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way superstar's agent is accused of increasingly demanding concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto and then demanding that their own business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal.

""[Nez] Balelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani's promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs' role in the project – for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,"" the lawsuit said, via the Associated Press.

""This case is about abuse of power,"" the lawsuit continued. ""Defendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built.

""Defendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants' misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all – celebrity or not.""

Ohtani and Balelo are accused of tortious interference and unjust enrichment, while also undermining their interests in another venture. 

Balelo's agency, CAA, declined to comment on the suit, according to the AP.

Balelo threatened to pull Ohtani from the deal if their own demands weren't met, the suit said.

""Kingsbarn began capitulating to Balelo's every whim,"" the suit said. ""Over time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with Otani than honoring its obligations to its business partners."" Ohtani signed his endorsement deal with the developers in 2023.

This is not the first time Ohtani has had off-field drama involving large sums of money. His former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, is serving a prison sentence for theft and fraud after stealing money from Ohtani to pay off gambling debts. The money delivered to bookies was from Ohtani's bank account.

President Donald Trump praised journalist Chuck Todd after Todd credited Trump's “impact” on the United States.

Todd offered his analysis on Trump's second term on CBN News on Monday, which caught the president's eye and prompted him to respond.

“I don't think we've had anybody have this much impact on the country since [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt],” Todd said. “I think culturally, in particular, certainly on how even our politics is conducted in that sense.” 

NEW: Chuck Todd on President Trump: ""I don't think we've had anybody have this much impact on the country since FDR."" @chucktodd @realDonaldTrump @CBNNews pic.twitter.com/nns803nKUf

“Look, [Trump] wants to involve himself in everything. FDR involved himself in almost everything.”

Todd cited Trump's threats to the Washington Commanders to return to the name Redskins, and his calls for the CEO of Intel to resign as examples. According to Todd, the Republican Party of the past would have decried such government involvement. 

Trump returned the favor by complimenting Todd in a Truth Social post Tuesday.

“Wow, thank you Chuck. I always said that you were far better than the scum that runs the FAKE NEWS at NBC and, especially, Brian Roberts and ‘Concast,'” Trump wrote. 

Trump was referencing NBC News's parent company, Comcast. The media conglomerate also owns MSNBC, CNBC, NBC Sports, Telemundo, and NBC Local Stations.

“You are a Free Man now. Congratulations – Use your time well!”

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CHASES SOCIAL MEDIA VIRALITY WITH POP CULTURE MEMES

Todd started a podcast after he was ousted by NBC News this January after 20 years at the network. At the time of his departure, Todd was the moderator of Meet the Press, where he did not shy away from criticizing Trump.

The Washington Examiner reached out to Todd for further comment.

I try to temper my natural brusqueness with watercooler niceties, but sometimes I can't help but speak up.

Dear James,

I can't seem to shut up at work, and I keep putting my foot in my mouth.

I am a naturally brusque person—a get-to-the-point kinda gal—but I am not a complete boor. Over the years I have learned to temper my directness with watercooler niceties and “please” and “thank you” in my emails.

But, sometimes, when faced with inadequate meeting agendas, disorganized communication, and paper-pushing bureaucracy, I can't help but speak up about our team-wide inadequacies. (My other colleagues are much more reserved.) I oscillate between wanting to shut up and act my wage, yet also wishing we would hold ourselves to higher standards. By God, can't we do better here?

This is not a new feeling in the office for me, and I am starting to question whether I'm the common denominator. Is it time to throw in the towel? Or should I do more to restrain my critical instincts?

Dear Reader,

I think your questions answer themselves. In the workplace, you should never restrain your critical instincts, and, yup, it's always a good time to throw in the towel. (When it comes to family, interestingly, the opposite is true.)

It does sound as if you are the common denominator, carting your high standards and your limited tolerance for banality and ineptitude from office to office. Then again, aren't we all the common denominators in our own lives? It's always us, in the middle of some situation, doing what we always seem to do, arriving at more or less the same outcomes, which for some reason bewilder us completely.

Not you, though: You're un-bewildered. You know what you're doing.

I've had only a couple of office jobs in my life. I'm a lucky bastard: I sit in coffee shops and type and fiddle around with my playlists on Apple Music. But I do know that watercooler niceties (to take a phrase from your letter) will kill you in the end, and that team-wide inadequacies (to take another one) are a condition of office life. And if you've had enough, you've had enough.

Continually firing myself,

James

Dear James,

After more than 40 years of cognitive behavioral therapy, I thought I'd overcome my childhood demons. But, like my parents before me, I still became an alcoholic. Now I'm 66, and I'm torn: Should I give up on the world? (The state of affairs is grim.) Or should I strive to live without alcohol?

Dear Reader,

I deeply appreciate this letter. So many of us right now are contemplating, approaching, or have already passed the moment of abdication you present so clearly. The moment of: You know what? Fuck it.

I hope you won't think I'm being flippant if I respond to your question with a couple of staves of soul doggerel. Here they are:

TO A READER ON THE VERGE

When the demons are upon you and the world is on its ass, why not sink in resignation to the bottom of a glass?

I'll tell you why: You're here to try, and while you have volition, to quote my friend Jay Babcock: Don't be bummed into submission.

Heroically,

James

An Israeli pollster explains what people there actually think about the events shocking the world's conscience.﻿

How do Israelis feel about the increasingly horrifying crimes their government is committing in Gaza?

This is one of the key questions going forward. Israel is a (teetering) democracy with elections scheduled for next year. The public's attitudes could — by putting pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition — play a major role in determining if, and when, we get a durable ceasefire. And yet, polling presents a somewhat confusing picture of their view on the war.

Surveys have consistently found 1) a majority of Israelis want a ceasefire to end the war, and 2) a majority of the Israeli population feels little concern about suffering among Gazan civilians. While Israelis have mostly shrugged off international condemnation of its conduct, the past week has seen a surge in antiwar activism, largely prompted by mass opposition to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to occupy Gaza City.

To make sense of this, I called up Dahlia Scheindlin, one of Israel's leading pollsters and author of an excellent recent book on Israeli democracy.

Scheindlin told me that Israeli opposition to the war is rooted in self-interest: a belief that continued fighting in Gaza is unnecessarily risking the lives of hostages (about 20 of whom are believed to be alive) and Israeli soldiers. Thus, opposition to the war is deepening while Israelis remain — on the whole — indifferent to the suffering of Gazans.

Beyond describing those beliefs, Scheindlin explained where they come from in Israeli society. She got into the deep roots of dehumanization on both sides of the conflict, the conspiracy theory shaping ordinary Israelis' views of starvation in Gaza, and why her time working in post-war Serbia made her more somewhat more optimistic about the chances that there could one day be real peace.

A transcript of our conversation follows, edited for length and clarity.

I want to start with a poll result that I found horrifying: 79 percent of Israeli Jews did not feel personally troubled by reports of starvation in Gaza. Do those results seem right to you, based on your broader read of the data? And what does this kind of poll say about the Israeli mindset?

Yeah, it absolutely strikes me as correct. There's a general trend [in polls] of a very strong majority of Israeli Jews expressing not only lack of empathy but belligerence and hostility towards Gazans, including civilians.

I do think we need to put it in the context of everybody else here. There are parallel trends of deep, deep hostility that we had seen already in joint Israeli-Palestinian survey research done before the war. Very hostile attitudes between the two populations definitely predate October 7.

The reason I asked specifically about Israeli Jews — though parallel trends of hostility is obviously hugely important in understanding the situation — is that their views are especially urgent amid the overwhelming evidence that the Israeli government's policy has created a starvation crisis. It is, I think, very difficult for people outside Israel to understand why that doesn't break through in its politics.

How is it that, when it seems like your government is committing such a crime, people aren't horrified? Is just dehumanization all the way down — that they think Palestinians deserve it? Or is there denial of what's clearly happening? Is there lack of coverage or censorship in the Israeli media?

It's all of those things.

Israeli media, as you pointed out, is barely covering civilian suffering in Gaza — which is not much of an excuse to be honest, because all of the information is available.

Polls have tested whether Israelis believe the starvation was happening. A recent survey found that 47 percent of all Israelis felt that it was probably lies and made up. Now, if it's 47 percent of the average, it's in the mid-to-upper 50 percent range among Jews — as presumably very few Palestinian citizens of Israel feel that way.

So 47 percent said it's not true; it's Hamas's lies. And another 18 percent said, “Even if it's true, I'm not bothered by it.”

Israelis are completely consumed with the hostages. It is front and center; it's everywhere. The country is flooded with hostage symbols: signs, slogans, pins. Everyone wears a pin, including the prime minister.

The second thing they're consumed with is the fate of their sons, brothers, husbands, fathers who are serving in Gaza.

Basically, the Israeli Jewish public thinks the war needs to stop — but because it's hurting them and not because it's hurting Palestinians.

Yes, that is correct.

There is a small portion of people who are increasingly troubled by the situation in Gaza — primarily the left, which represents about 20 percent of Israelis. Among the Jewish population, it's about 12 percent to 14 percent. So, it's a minority, but those people are troubled enough that some of them have begun making that a much more central part of their public activity.

I'm a little bit skeptical of making it seem like there's sweeping growing trends [toward public outcry about Gazan suffering]. There are demonstrations of people holding posters of children who've been killed in Gaza and also of people going to Air Force bases in Israel to hold those posters and say, “Don't go.” There were two people who burst into a reality TV show — you know, primetime television — a couple days ago and screamed, “Stop the war.” Is it growing? I don't know. But it's certainly becoming more urgent, and they're making the claim more publicly, and I think they feel that there's some space to make that claim more publicly.

I think what you hear among a lot of mainstream Israelis — which includes people from the center and even the moderate right — is that, of course, the war is bad for everybody — get our hostages back, our sons back — and it's also bad for Gazans. But [the Gazans] certainly are not a priority.

Many Israelis simply say, “I cannot be sad for the civilians of Gaza,” after what they saw on October 7 and during hostage releases. They were often released with these really grotesque ceremonies and forced to cheer and [surrounded by] mobs.

On one of those days when a hostage was released, I had a friend write to me saying, “You still think there are innocent people in Gaza?” because of the mob.

Now, even if there are thousands of people [jeering at hostages], that's out of 2 million. And, of course, we had thousands of people on the Israeli side who support, you know, terrible things.

But [the imagery] is part of what explains the very dehumanizing attitudes that don't allow for compassion.

Is this psychology part of what allows many Israelis to dismiss the seriousness or significance of the international outrage about Gaza?

They would say that the Europeans or whoever simply don't get it; they haven't been through what we've been through, and they don't understand what it's like here. Or, even more aggressively, that they're either being taken in by Hamas propaganda or are themselves antisemitic. 

What [Israelis] are saying now is, “Everybody forgot about October 7.” They forgot who really started it — because, for a lot of Israelis, everything was sort of manageable before that.

I think that the world hasn't forgotten October 7. They just don't think it's an excuse for what Israel is doing anymore.

Right. 

It's [also] an extremely widespread view here that the entire global media is against Israel because the world — [including] the UN and the international system — is always critical of Israel. And the government is compulsively pushing the line that the rest of the world is just being spoon-fed lies directly by Hamas.

In their defense, there's a grain of truth to that, right? Hamas will lie about things all the time; they're a horrifying organization. 

I know, but the assumption is that there's nobody else getting information out — that there's no Palestinian journalists who are doing their work, that there's no social media, that the international organizations who are there are never getting new information — it's only Hamas, and that international media isn't making any effort to get information from any source other than Hamas, which is just fundamentally factually not true. International media is getting its information from their own stringers and reporters inside Gaza, from credible vetted social media, or international organizations.

If you think that the whole thing is made up, you're looking at a vast conspiracy of collusion between Hamas, observers on the ground, average Palestinians — a huge conspiracy of all of them.

It seems to me that there's a real opportunity here for a politician or political faction in Israel to turn the things that Israelis are mad about — the hostages, soldier casualties — into an indictment of the broader right-wing worldview that is inflicting harm on Palestinians and taking their land is good for Israeli security — to argue that the government's whole theory of the case is a failure, and that a new approach is needed.

And yet, I just have not seen a very successful articulation of an alternative philosophy — one that has caught fire and become really powerful in Israeli politics — since October 7. The public opinion groundwork is there, but politicians aren't taking advantage of it.

You're absolutely right; politicians aren't taking advantage of it. Nobody's really making a case for an alternative. The opposition [parties are] maddeningly focused on criticizing; all of the critical points that you and I have just raised are out there. But nobody connects the dots and says, “Here is an alternative. Here's what we would do differently.”

Everybody limits themselves saying, for example, what we would do differently on a hostage deal. It's never about the bigger vision: How do you envision Israel ending this war and preventing the next war?

I can tell you, from politicians' perspective, it's because they know that, on a deeper level, Israelis are right-wing. [About] 60 percent of Jewish Israelis self-identify as right-wing. They don't want a Palestinian state, and they don't want to hear about a negotiated solution, and they don't want to hear about concessions.

So, that's why the opposition politicians don't want to get into it, because they have forgotten that leadership means courage — that leadership means leading, not following. They're basically just cowards running after a very simplistic reading of public opinion. Even scratching one level below the surface, they would know that you can change public opinion over time.

We've seen repeatedly, over a decade, that the public changes its mind slowly and incrementally, but significantly, on issues related to conflict resolution or negotiations, concessions, final status — especially when they see it as a realistic possibility, and especially when their leadership is behind it and makes the case.

I know from personal experience doing public opinion polling for Prime Minister Ehud Barak during the Camp David negotiations [the US-led peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians] in the year 2000. I was literally conducting the research, watching the focus groups, looking at the data through every night or almost every night of that negotiation, and people were changing their minds — slowly, but very steadily considering how compressed it was — over extremely controversial things. Did they love it? No, but they were moving.

When we try to tell people in polls, “Here are the advantages [of peace],” they can change their minds a little bit — but it's so remote from their experience, so hypothetical. There's no anchor in reality. If politicians were getting behind this, they would be able to create that kind of momentum.

That's a bit grim, right? 

I thought my previous analysis was extremely optimistic.

What I'm saying is that public opinion can change. The conditions are that there are some realistic policy grounds for a change in the situation and legitimate leaders who are advocating for it. And those two things are not impossible.

Well, they're just not there now, though. That's why I said it's grim. 

Right now, sure. However, we have elections coming up; we're heading into an election year in 2026. [It's] very unlikely before then, but possibly. And all polls are showing opportunity is there, and the Netanyahu government has not been able to win a majority in any credible survey.

It could still happen that Netanyahu wins again, but it's also possible that a different government might have a little bit less acumen at spinning the world around their finger — and even start feeling some pressure from the world to move towards two states.

So, then, let me ask one long-term question. There's a line from the writer Omar El Akkad that I can't really get out of my head. I'm sure you've heard it.

“One day, everyone will have always been against this.”

Exactly. Do you think that's true when it comes to Israel? That one day, Israelis who supported the war will say, “I never could have supported that”?

I think that this collective sense of regret — the rewriting of history whereby everybody was against it — is probably the exception more than the rule.

I worked in various countries in the Balkans from roughly 2006 to 2010. What I saw there is that every side thought that they got the short end of the deal. Every side thought that the world was against them. Every side was embittered.

But particularly the Serbian side, which I know better and was also viewed as the aggressor. I pretty much never encountered anybody who thought that they did the wrong thing other than losing. I'll never forget the taxi driver who said, “You know, we lost Bosnia, we lost Kosovo, we lost everything.” And that — [not the genocide] — was his major regret.

Yet, peace between Serbia and both Bosnia and Kosovo seems to be holding.

That's part of another developing hypothesis I have — which I haven't proved — but maybe somebody's investigated. I think there is a habitation factor to both violence and nonviolence. The longer you experience nonviolence, the harder it becomes to break it — even if you kind of still hate each other.

So, no, I'm not waiting for Israelis and Palestinians to love each other. We don't have the luxury of waiting for that.

In this article

There's a new company at the center of the intensifying battle between Elon Musk and Sam Altman: Apple.

Musk and Altman, who helped start OpenAI a decade ago with a group of other co-founders, had a public falling out that led to a legal fight last year, with Musk accusing Altman of breach of contract for abandoning the artificial intelligence company's founding mission.

The back-and-forth war of words and lawsuits took another dramatic turn on Monday, when Musk threatened Apple with ""immediate"" legal action over alleged antitrust violations. Musk's complaint, which he voiced on his social media site X, is that Apple favors OpenAI's ChatGPT over X's Grok chatbot in the App Store.

""Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,"" Musk wrote, without citing evidence. ""xAI will take immediate legal action.""

Apple partnered with OpenAI in mid-2024 to integrate ChatGPT into its iPhone, iPad, Mac laptop and desktop products. Readers added context to Musk's post, pointing out that China's DeepSeek reached the top spot in the App Store in January of this year, and that Perplexity was No. 1 in India in July.

Altman quickly responded to Musk's accusations.

""This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like,"" Altman wrote in a post on X Monday night.

Altman referenced a 2023 report from tech news site Platformer that described how Musk, after acquiring Twitter (now X), made sweeping platform changes and ""created a special system for showing you all his tweets first.""

Altman said that if Musk ended up filing a suit, he hoped it would lead to ""counter-discovery on this,"" adding that he and many others ""would love to know what's been happening.""

The feud continued into the morning hours on Tuesday.

""You got 3M views on your bulls--- post, you liar, far more than I've received on many of mine, despite me having 50 times your follower count!"" Musk wrote.

Musk's X account indicates he has 224 million followers, but the company has never disclosed how many could be bots. Altman's account on X lists 3.9 million followers.

Altman clapped back, asking if Musk would ""sign an affidavit that you have never directed changes to the X algorithm in a way that has hurt your competitors"" or helped his own companies, and said he would offer a personal apology in return.

Neither Musk nor his attorneys responded to requests for comment. OpenAI referred CNBC to Altman's posts and the company's past statements. Apple declined to comment.

Musk stepped down from the OpenAI board in 2018, after hiring another founding member of the startup, Andrej Karpathy, to run the Autopilot team at Tesla. Around the time he left OpenAI, Musk said he saw AI as ""potentially more dangerous than nukes.""

As part of his lawsuit against OpenAI, Musk asked a federal court to stop the AI startup from converting into a fully for-profit business. Musk argued that OpenAI ditched its original mission as a nonprofit to develop AI ""for the benefit of humanity broadly."" A federal judge in California denied Musk's effort to halt the transformation.

OpenAI has emerged as a massive commercial enterprise since the public launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, and is now in talks with investors about a stock sale that would value the company at roughly $500 billion, CNBC confirmed last week.

Musk formed xAI in March 2023, announcing its debut four months later. Since then, he has raised billions of dollars for the company, merged it with X and called for Tesla, his only publicly traded business, to invest billions more into the AI company.

In February, a Musk-led group of investors offered to buy control of OpenAI for $97.4 billion. Altman responded on X, saying, ""no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.""

In dragging Apple into the dispute, Musk has focused on the App Store, where ChatGPT is currently the top-ranked free app while Grok is fifth. Musk took issue with ChatGPT being listed as one of the store's ""Must-Have Apps,"" a list that does not include Grok.

""Why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your 'Must Have' section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps? Are you playing politics?"" Musk wrote in a post.

Grok releases have been riddled with safety issues and concerns surrounding manipulation of the technology. In May, the chatbot promoted false claims about alleged ""white genocide"" in South Africa, leading Musk to write that the automatic responses were the result of an ""unauthorized modification."" In July, Grok responses across X included praise for Adolf Hitler.

Musk's threats to Apple come as the iPhone maker faces pressure from regulators and competitors over App Store policies. A panel of judges in June denied Apple's emergency application to halt changes to its App Store that resulted from the company's legal battle with Epic Games. In 2021, a judge ruled that Apple could no longer prohibit developers from directing users away from the company's in-app purchasing, which brings with it up to 30% of gross sales.

In this article

The Trump administration is still working out the details of its 15% export tax on Nvidia and AMD and could bring deals of this kind to more companies, the White House's Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.

""Right now it stands with these two companies. Perhaps it could expand in the future to other companies,"" said Leavitt, the White House's spokesperson. 

""The legality of it, the mechanics of it, is still being ironed out by the Department of Commerce, and I would defer you to them for any further details on how it will actually be implemented,"" she continued.

President Donald Trump confirmed on Monday that he had negotiated a deal with Nvidia in which the U.S. government approves export licenses for the China-specific H20 AI chip in exchange for a 15% cut of revenue. Advanced Micro Devices also got licenses approved in exchange for a proportion of its China sales, the White House confirmed.

""I said, 'If I'm going to do that, I want you to pay us as a country something, because I'm giving you a release,'"" Trump said Monday.

""We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets,"" Nvidia said in a statement this week.

Trump said the export licenses for AMD and Nvidia were a done deal. But lawyers and experts who follow trade have warned that Trump's deal may be complicated because of existing laws that regulate how the government can charge fees for export licenses.

The Commerce Department didn't immediately return a request for comment.

The H20 is Nvidia's Chinese-specific chip that is slowed down on purpose to comply with U.S. export relations. It's related to the H100 and H200 chips that are used in the U.S., and was introduced after the Biden administration implemented export controls on artificial intelligence chips in 2023.

Earlier this year, Nvidia said that it was on track to sell more than $8 billion worth of H20 chips in a single quarter before the Trump administration in April said that it would require a license to export the chip.

Trump signaled in July that he was likely to approve export licenses for the chip after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang visited the White House.

The U.S. regulates AI chips like those made by Nvidia for national security reasons, saying that they could be used by the Chinese government to leapfrog U.S. capabilities in AI, or they could be used by the Chinese military or linked groups.

The Chinese government has been encouraging local companies in recent weeks to avoid using Nvidia's H20 chips for any government or national security-related work, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.

Oops, something went wrong

Buckle up, crypto fans—Bitcoin‘s (CRYPTO: BTC) reign might be wobbling, and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) is charging onto the scene like a rockstar stealing the spotlight!

Track BTC movement here.

As of this week, the crypto world is buzzing with a seismic shift. TradingView charts show Bitcoin's market dominance dipping to 59.87%—a drop that's got tongues wagging.

On the other hand, Ether's dominance has surged to 13.62%, fueled by a jaw-dropping 51.68% price jump in the past month alone. With Ether hitting $4,486.75 and outpacing Bitcoin's modest 1.70% monthly gain, it's clear something big is brewing.

What's driving this Ether frenzy?

Recent news paints a thrilling picture. On Aug. 11, Cointelegraph reported Vitalik Buterin reclaiming billionaire status as ETH soared, a testament to its skyrocketing value. Posts on social media are abuzz with excitement, with analysts highlighting Vitalik's statement that Ethereum has exceeded anyone's expectations thanks to its tech upgrades and booming ecosystem.

The SEC's recent pro-crypto moves, unveiled by Chair Paul Atkins, have also lit a fire under Ether, with new reforms positioning it as a key U.S. infrastructure player—news that broke on July 31 and sent waves through the market.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin, priced at $119,367.90, is feeling the heat. Its dominance has slid from a high of 66% earlier this year, and recent web reports suggest investors might be cashing out profits or shifting focus to altcoins.

The contrast is stark—Ether's ecosystem, powered by DeFi and NFT growth, is pulling in capital, while Bitcoin's slower pace hints at a market craving fresh excitement.

Could this be the start of an ""altseason"" where Ether challenges Bitcoin's throne? With Ethereum ETFs raking in record inflows—$2.12 billion in a single week per CoinDesk's July 21 report—and DeFi TVL soaring, the momentum is undeniable.

Bitcoin fans might argue it's just a breather, but Ether's recent surge, backed by institutional hype and innovative upgrades, suggests a thrilling new chapter. One thing's for sure: in this crypto rollercoaster, the ride's far from over—grab your popcorn!

Ethereum (ETH) was the only major cryptocurrency in the green in pre-market U.S. market hours as Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market wobbled ahead of Tuesday's core inflation data release.

Ethereum's price climbed 0.6% in the last 24 hours to just under $4,300, following a record $1 billion in daily ETF inflows on Monday. Farside data shows Ethereum's fund inflows far outpaced Bitcoin's, which totaled $178 million. 

The Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) attracted the biggest share, with a record $640 million going into the fund, followed by the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), which also recorded its largest single-day inflow, taking in $277 million. On Stocktwits, retail sentiment around Ethereum remained in ‘bullish' territory over the past day amid ‘high' levels of chatter.

Ethereum's resilience was shared by Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) and FG Nexus (FGNX). Shares of both Ethereum-holding companies gained more than 5% in pre-market trade. The two are competing to become the largest corporate holders of the cryptocurrency. FG Nexus has set an ambitious target of acquiring 10% of Ethereum's total supply, while Bitmine is aiming for 5%. Bitmine currently leads with 1.15 million tokens, far ahead of FG Nexus's 53,731 ETH.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin's price fell 2.4% in the last 24 hours to around $118,200. This puts the apex cryptocurrency's price 3.7% below its all-time high of $122,220, seen last month. Retail sentiment around the apex cryptocurrency fell to ‘bearish' from ‘neutral' territory a day ago. 

Losses were broad across major altcoins as meme token Dogecoin (DOGE) fell 5.3%, Ripple's native token XRP (XRP) slipped 4.9%, Cardano (ADA) dropped 4.8% followed by Solana (SOL), which fell 4.6%. The overall cryptocurrency market shed 1.9% of its value over the past day, trending just above $4 trillion, at the time of writing.

Crypto market volatility led to $425 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours. Most of the liquidations came from long bets–traders who bet that the price of cryptocurrencies would rise, amounting to around $340 million. Short liquidations were around $85 million. Ethereum experienced the largest liquidations of $118 million, followed by Bitcoin at $69 million.

Due to BTC trading sideways, Bitcoin-linked stocks were mixed during pre-market trading. Shares of Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, edged 0.3% lower. Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT) stock fell 0.18%, and shares of its peer, Mara Holdings (MARA), dipped 0.7%. Meanwhile, crypto exchange Coinbase Global's (COIN) stock moved 0.49% higher.

- Orange Cap Games partners with Kaito AI to let Moonbirds NFT holders earn Yap Points via social media engagement.

- The collaboration boosts Moonbirds trading volume by 369% and raises floor price 28% post-announcement.

- Yap Points, awarded through AI analysis of user content, unlock future rewards like airdrops or exclusive privileges.

- Moonbirds' 10,000 Ethereum-based owl NFTs feature nesting rewards for long-term holders.

- This model pioneers active NFT utility, potentially reshaping engagement between NFT projects and AI platforms.

Orange Cap Games, the new IP manager of the Moonbirds NFT collection, has announced a partnership with Kaito AI, an AI-driven search platform for the Web3 and crypto space, to allow Moonbirds NFT holders to participate in the Kaito AI Leaderboard and earn Yap Points [1]. This collaboration marks the first time a major NFT project has integrated directly into the Kaito AI leaderboard, offering holders new ways to engage with their assets and earn potential future benefits [1].  

Under the terms of the partnership, Moonbirds holders can earn Yap Points by sharing content about the project, including the Moonbirds, Mythics, and Oddities NFTs, on social media platforms such as X. The Kaito AI system uses artificial intelligence to analyze user contributions and assign Yap Points, which reflect a user's engagement and influence in promoting the project. These points may unlock future rewards, including airdrops or exclusive ecosystem privileges [1].  

Kaito AI operates as a specialized search engine, aggregating data from social media, governance forums, and research to provide real-time insights into the crypto and NFT markets. The platform previously introduced the Kaito Yap leaderboard, which rewarded top contributors with airdrops such as the ANIME token distribution [1]. With the Moonbirds integration, the platform expands its focus to major NFT projects and their communities.  

The partnership appears to have already driven increased activity in the Moonbirds NFT market. According to on-chain data from CoinGecko, the NFT collection's trading volume surged by over 369% following the announcement. In the past 24 hours, the Moonbirds NFT recorded a trading volume of 451 ETH, and the floor price rose by 28% to 2.88 ETH [1]. These figures suggest that the collaboration has generated renewed interest and engagement among holders.  

Orange Cap Games acquired the Moonbirds NFT project from Yuga Labs and now oversees its development and ecosystem. The Moonbirds collection includes 10,000 pixelated owl birds, while Mythics and Oddities feature additional NFTs, all hosted on the Ethereum blockchain. These collections are known for their “nesting” mechanism, which rewards long-term holders with benefits over time [1].  

By integrating the Moonbirds NFT into the Kaito AI Leaderboard, the project introduces a novel approach to NFT utility and engagement. Instead of passive ownership, holders are incentivized to contribute to the project's visibility and growth. This model could influence future collaborations between NFT projects and AI platforms, potentially broadening the value proposition for NFT owners [1].

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Pump.fun Token Nears ICO Price: Which Presales Could Explode Next?","https://coincentral.com/pump-fun-token-nears-ico-price-which-presales-could-explode-next/","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 19:00:41 GMT","

The Pump.fun token's (PUMP) ICO was among the largest in history, raising about $500 million in less than 12 minutes after launch. It launched with a fully diluted valuation of over $4 billion, and an ICO price of $0.004 per token.

Even though the PUMP token jumped to roughly $0.0068 soon after its listing, whales were quick to cash out, provoking a nearly 67% decline in the token's value. The token has finally started showing signs of a healthy recovery over the past few weeks and is now approaching the ICO price level.

But continued sell-offs by large holders have capped bullish momentum. While PUMP is still constrained by whale dominance, opportunistic traders are already looking for new cryptocurrencies with higher potential.

One standout project on their lists is Snorter Token (SNORT), the native token of a Solana-based trading bot that will power lightning-fast trades and snipes through a Telegram interface. Early investor interest has already helped the token raise more than $3 million in its recently launched presale, with some predicting that it could become one of the biggest crypto launches of 2025.

Meme coin enthusiasts are closely watching PUMP's next swing, as many see it as an important factor in determining if Solana's meme coin frenzy is still going strong.

After sliding from roughly $0.007 to an all-time low of $0.0022 on July 29, the PUMP token took a bullish stance and has been climbing within a rising wedge ever since. We're witnessing a series of higher lows and slightly shallower higher highs, indicating that buyers are still in control, but are losing a bit of momentum with each push.

The on-chain story behind that rebound is just as revealing. Pump.fun has reclaimed its position as Solana's top meme coin launchpad, hosting more than 65% of 27,500 daily launches.

This increased platform activity directly correlates with the demand for PUMP tokens, as creators and traders use the token to cover fees and participate in incentives. What's worth noting is that even with platform metrics flashing green, some heavyweight traders are already heading for the exits.

On-chain analytics firm Lookonchain notes that the whale trader ParallelAiRev has recently cashed out every one of his long bets on the PUMP token, locking in gains while the price sat near its recent peak.

Whale investor @ParallelAiRev just closed all his $PUMP longs, taking profits at highs.

Over the past month, he has made a total profit of over $1.5M, becoming the most profitable $PUMP trader on Hyperliquid's 30-day leaderboard.https://t.co/qpdFcdbuUr pic.twitter.com/lh8O3lpfGS

— Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 11, 2025



 

Lookonchain mentions that the trader accumulated more than $1.5 million in profit over the last 30 days, placing him at the top of Hyperliquid's 30-day PUMP-trading leaderboard.

From a fundamental point of view, Pump.fun has spent about 118,000 SOL (roughly $19 million) buying back almost three billion PUMP tokens at $0.0064 each. By scooping up such a huge chunk of supply, the team has temporarily reduced the number of coins in circulation.

In theory, buybacks make each remaining token scarcer. But PUMP is still down 53% over the past month, suggesting that organic demand remains relatively low.

Given the headwinds PUMP is facing, many traders are scouting new presales for higher upside, and Snorter Token is quickly moving to the top of that list.

Snorter Bot is an automated Web3 trading solution on Telegram that will use Solana tech for higher speed and efficiency. Its goal is to help everyday users spot and act on emerging token opportunities, helping them find the next 100x gem before it goes mainstream.

To accomplish this, Snorter Bot comes equipped with advanced features that were previously reserved for professional trading tools. For instance, Snorter Bot will monitor new token launches on Solana and execute trades within milliseconds using an upgraded Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).

More importantly, the bot will also feature scam detection and honeypot filters to automatically flag suspicious contracts or potential rug pulls before any new token purchases are made.

SNORT is the utility token that will fuel the Snorter Bot platform, and holding it will unlock several benefits to users. For example, the tokens will unlock reduced trading fees as low as 0.85% per trade (versus 1.5% for non-holders) and provide access to premium bot features, including unlimited snipes.

Looking at SNORT's potential, popular market commentator ClayBro is bullish on the token's future. In his latest video, he shows us how Google's Gemini predicts SNORT could jump toward $1 by year-end and push past $2 during the next bull run peak in 2025–26.



Interested buyers can visit Snorter Token's official website to buy SNORT for a discounted presale price. They can also immediately stake SNORT for a high passive yield of up to 146% annually.

That's according to a report Tuesday (Aug. 12) from Bloomberg News, citing sources familiar with the matter, as the news outlet examines Visa's wider efforts in the stablecoin space.

“This is just another mechanism for value exchange,” Cuy Sheffield, Visa's head of cryptocurrency, said in an interview with Bloomberg, referring to stablecoins more generally. “I see it massively expanding our addressable market.”

The Bloomberg report says many analysts see stablecoins as a potential opportunity for Visa, and not a threat. Stablecoin payments are in theory cheaper than card fees, they still require services such as fraud prevention, dispute resolution and compliance checks, along with connections to bank payment rails and fiat currency conversion.

Visa, the report continues, wants to serve as a bridge as the flow of money shifts, using its infrastructure to help make stablecoins more mainstream for merchants and consumers.

“They are going after the land grab of empowering every possible stablecoin platform with a payment capability,” said Richard Crone, chief executive officer of payments consultant Crone Consulting. “This is a really big opportunity.”

Asked by PYMNTS about the assertion that Visa is weighing its own stablecoin launch, a company spokesperson said that in the stablecoin ecosystem, it is difficult to rule anything out.

“But our focus is on what we can do today: scale stablecoin-linked cards, enable stablecoin settlement, and work closely with our bank partners to help them leverage stablecoins across a range of use cases. That's our near-term priority and what's active in the market right now. ”

Visa spent a large portion of its recent earnings call on its ongoing investments and bets on stablecoins, which had just become legally operable digital assets in the U.S.

“Consumers and businesses are using stablecoins to save money in U.S. dollars, but they also want to spend that money, and there's no better way to do that than with a Visa crypto card,” Visa CEO Ryan McInerney said in a call with analysts.

“We are piloting and partnering with stablecoin companies … as we build out our stablecoin settlement stack … we are working to streamline treasury operations, improve liquidity management and enable quick and more cost effective cross-border transactions.”

“We are also helping banks issue their own stablecoins and realize the benefits of programmable money,” the CEO added. “There is so much more to come in this space.”

PYMNTS examined the growth of stablecoins in a report last week, arguing that while there are still some logistical and regulatory obstacles, there's evidence that stablecoins “are not just waiting around” to become part of the larger financial system.

“Instead, they're partnering, building and plugging themselves into traditional finance, with the goal of reshaping not just how money moves but the store of value itself,” the report said.

NEW YORK — Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and wire fraud Tuesday morning, three years after the dramatic $60 billion collapse of the Terra/Luna stablecoin ecosystem.



The 33-year old South Korean national arrived in court in handcuffs and a canary yellow prison jumpsuit, a metal chain around his waist. He admitted that he ""knowingly engaged in a scheme to defraud and did in fact defraud"" purchasers of the TerraUSD  stablecoin.



Judge Paul Engelmayer, who is overseeing the case, walked the Terra creator through the charges to establish that Kwon was indeed guilty of the allegations laid out in an earlier indictment, which included seven other charges such as securities and commodities fraud. Under the charges in the original indictment, Kwon faced a maximum sentence of 135 years in prison if convicted on all counts. Kwon's plea agreement with the government slashes his maximum sentence to 25 years — 20 for the wire fraud charge, and five for the fraud conspiracy charge, which the judge can either order to be served consecutively or concurrently.



Throughout the hearing, the judge noted that he was not bound by the DOJ's plea agreement, meaning he could sentence Kwon to a lengthier sentence than the DOJ suggested.



Under the terms of the plea agreement, laid out by an assistant U.S. attorney, Kwon agreed to pay a maximum forfeiture of $19,286,774.78 plus interest, forfeit what Engelmeyer described as a “substantial set” of properties and pay restitution. He also agreed not to contest the factual allegations in the indictment. In exchange, the DOJ agreed to recommend a maximum sentence of 12 years. Once he's served half of his ultimate sentence, the DOJ agreed to support any motion Kwon makes for an international prisoner transfer.



Kwon's attorney said there remain open charges against him in South Korea.



In a prepared statement, Kwon said he'd worked with others to defraud UST purchasers in South Korea, the Southern District of New York and other locations between 2018 and 2022, and that he'd used international and interstate wires to do so.



“Between 2018 and 2022 in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere, I knowingly agreed with others to engage in a scheme to defraud, and did in fact defraud, purchasers of the cryptocurrencies issued by my company, Terraform Labs,” Kwon said. ""In 2021, I made false and misleading statements about why [UST] regained its peg,"" he added, noting that a trading firm had been involved. ""What I did was wrong and I want to apologize for my conduct.""



Kwon had repeatedly and publicly cheered on UST, criticizing detractors or anyone who questioned the token's stability.



""Have fun staying poor,"" he tweeted at one user on X in 2021.



Just over a dozen people sat in the gallery ahead of the hearing, with more than half of that group consisting of reporters. Throughout the hearing, the judge asked a number of procedural questions to establish that Kwon was competent to plead guilty, running briefly through his medical history and checking at multiple points that Kwon had read the filings he was agreeing to and discussed them with his legal team.



Kwon will be sentenced on Dec. 11 at 11:00 a.m. in Manhattan. By the time of his sentencing, he will have been in U.S. custody for almost a year.



Kwon has been in the U.S. since New Year's, following a lengthy extradition process with the government of Montenegro. He and Terraform Labs had already been found liable for civil fraud by a jury in a case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, following UST's collapse.

Ether (ETH) has climbed 5% in the past 24 hours to $4,470, its highest price since December 2021.

Helping the bullish action in crypto in general was Tuesday morning's Consumer Price Index report. While the data was mixed and inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, market participants lifted bets on the U.S. central bank trimming interest rates at its next meeting in September.

Boosting ether in particular was a new massive leg higher in the growing corporate treasury strategy movement. Already the owner of roughly $5 billion in ETH, Tom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) disclosed plans to raise up to $20 billion in capital for further purchases.

The move extends a months-long rally for the Ethereum network's native token, which also continues to outperform bitcoin after years of severe relative weakeness. The ETH/BTC ratio rose above 0.37 on Tuesday, now higher by nearly 50% over the past month, though still lower by 15% year-over-year.

A key driver in recent weeks has been surging inflows into U.S. spot ether exchange-traded funds. On Monday, ether ETFs saw a record $1 billion in daily inflows, again surpassing their bitcoin equivalents.

“Ethereum's outperformance today, with a gain of over 4% against Bitcoin's muted move, reflects the market's focus on its own set of powerful catalysts,” said Axel Rudolph, senior technical analyst at IG. “Institutional inflows into US spot ETH ETFs following the US's CPI print, coupled with growing confidence in the network's recent upgrades, are proving far more compelling for investors than the broader macro-driven momentum underpinning bitcoin.”

Supporters have increasingly dubbed Ethereum “the blockchain of Wall Street,” pointing to its central role in tokenizing assets, hosting decentralized finance platforms and powering settlement systems that resemble traditional market infrastructure.

""We're seeing a wave of renewed interest from institutional and sophisticated investors who view ETH as more than just a ‘second-place' crypto,"" said David Siemer, co-founder and CEO of Wave Digital Assets. ""They see it as the backbone of DeFi, tokenization, and the largest smart contract ecosystem.""

""Given the backdrop of greater regulatory clarity out of the U.S. and the passing of the GENIUS Act, combined with ETH-focused digital asset treasuries such as Sharplink buying significant amounts of the token, and a resurgence in DeFi activity across ETH-focused protocols, it's clear there is broader institutional interest in the ecosystem,"" he said.

If the Fed delivers the rate cut traders are betting on, the combination of looser monetary policy, strong ETF demand and strategic positioning by large investors could further fuel ETH's run — although, as with past rallies, volatility may prove just as intense on the way down.

 The Terraform Labs co-founder was indicted in 2023 on nine charges related to the collapse of the ecosystem, resulting in an estimated $40 billion in losses. 

Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon has changed his plea from not guilty to guilty on two counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud.

According to reporting on Tuesday from the US District Court in the Southern District of New York (SDNY), Kwon waived his right to go to trial on two of the nine charges he has been facing from the US government and pleaded guilty. The reported plea agreement with prosecutors would impose $19 million in financial penalties.

The two felony charges could carry up to a 25-year prison sentence if served consecutively, but the agreement reportedly would have prosecutors not recommend more than 12 years. Kwon's sentencing hearing was scheduled for Dec. 11.

“It will be up to me to decide what a just sentence for you would be,” said Engelmayer on Tuesday, according to Inner City Press.

The Terraform co-founder was indicted in March 2023 for charges including securities fraud, market manipulation, money laundering and wire fraud related to his role at the company. He first appeared in the New York courtroom in January after his extradition from Montenegro, pleading not guilty to all charges and remaining in US custody without bail.

After the 2022 Terra crash, Kwon's whereabouts were largely unknown until Montenegrin authorities arrested him for using falsified travel documents. He served four months in prison before US and South Korean officials both petitioned Montenegro for extradition, which was complicated by challenges in the country's lower courts.

It was unclear as of Tuesday why the Terraform co-founder had chosen to change his plea after seven months. According to court filings, US prosecutors had been discussing “pretrial motions and related issues” with Kwon's lawyers, but had still been expected to go to trial in January 2026.

Crypto-related figures facing criminal charges in SDNY have not always gotten off easy. In 2024, a federal judge sentenced former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison. Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm was recently found guilty of running an unlicensed money transmitting service and is expected to be sentenced soon, potentially facing a retrial for two charges.

 Hex Trust has integrated Tezos-based Etherlink to offer institutional custody for xU3O8, a tokenized uranium asset listed on multiple exchanges. 

Digital asset custody firm Hex Trust has integrated Etherlink, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible layer 2 built on Tezos, to add institutional custody for xU3O8, a tokenized uranium asset issued on the network.

The integration is backed by Trilitech, the research and development (R&D) adoption hub for Tezos and developer of Etherlink, which is working with Hex Trust to connect institutional clients to xU3O8 and other Etherlink-based assets, according to a Tuesday announcement shared with Cointelegraph.

“Tokenized commodities like uranium are gaining institutional interest as more real-world assets move onchain,” said Giorgia Pellizzari, head of custody at Hex Trust.

Listed on multiple exchanges, xU3O8 allows users to invest in physical uranium, U308, the product created when uranium ore has been mined and milled. It is backed by uranium trading firm Curzon and UK-regulated exchange Archax.

The addition of uranium extends Hex Trust's real-world asset (RWA) services into a commodity that is tightly controlled and historically difficult for institutions to access.

Ben Elvidge, Trilitech's head of commercial applications, called uranium a “perfect fit” for tokenization, citing challenges in market access and pricing transparency.

“Now we can solve both problems with blockchain rails. Having a proper regulated custodian like Hex Trust in the mix just makes it that much easier for institutions to dip their toes in the water,” he said.

Hex Trust is licensed in Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai and Italy. Last year, the firm announced it had obtained in-principle approval from the Singapore financial regulator for a major payment institution (MPI) license.

Related: RWA token market grows 260% in 2025 as firms embrace regulating crypto

Last year, Uranium.io, the world's first decentralized application for uranium trading, launched on the Tezos blockchain in partnership with Curzon Uranium and Archax.

The platform is designed to lower barriers to entry in the global uranium trade, which was historically dominated by institutional investors. Prior to this, retail investors could only gain exposure to uranium through ETFs, as direct trading was largely restricted to institutional players with significant capital.

Earlier this year, Transak partnered with Uranium.io to let retail investors buy tokenized uranium with crypto or credit cards for as little as $10, a sharp drop from the $4.2 million minimum required in the over-the-counter market.

Heads up!

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The theory of continental drift was proposed by German meteorologist Alfred Wegener more than a century ago in 1912. According to the theory, the continents we know today were once connected as one big “supercontinent” called Pangea. The theory explains why continental coasts align like puzzle pieces, and why fossils from certain species are found in vastly different places. 

Experts suggest that the supercontinent began breaking apart around 200 million years ago—a timeline that has been widely accepted as geological history for decades. But an international research team may be challenging that notion. A new study published in the journal Geology suggests that a giant, hot blob split Greenland from North America 80 million years ago—and now, it's heading toward New York. 

“This thermal upwelling has long been a puzzling feature of North American geology.” lead author of the study Tom Gernon said in a press release. “Our research suggests it's part of a much larger, slow-moving process deep underground that could potentially help explain why mountain ranges like the Appalachians are still standing.”

The hot zone on which the study focused is a feature called the North Atlantic Anomaly (NAA), residing deep beneath the crust. Experts estimate that the molten rock mass is around 350 kilometers (218 miles) wide, and it currently sits 200 kilometers (124 miles) beneath the Appalachian Mountains in New England. 

Using geodynamic simulations, tectonic plate reconstructions, and seismic tomography data, researchers traced the origins of the mass back to the Labrador Sea, where Canada and Greenland began splitting around 80 million years ago. Researchers estimate that the blob migrates at a rate of 20 kilometers (12 miles) per million years. Per the team's calculations, the mass is steadily heading toward New York City—but Yankees fans, fear not! Experts anticipate the center of the anomaly won't pass through the Big Apple for the next 15 trillion years. 

The study expands on recent research that proposed a new idea called the “mantle wave” theory, which posits that the molten material beneath Earth's surface behaves almost like a lava lamp. When continents divide, hot, dense rock bubbles off the base of tectonic plates, and the “waves” move across continents' lower surfaces. Once beneath the base of a continent, the heat from the blob works like the fire in a hot air balloon, making the continent more buoyant. Researchers believe this phenomenon could've caused ancient mountains to be “further uplifted” over the past few million years.  

“Our earlier research shows that these ‘drips' of rock can form in series, like domino stones when they fall one after the other, and sequentially migrate over time,” co-author Sascha Brune said in the press release. “The feature we see beneath New England is very likely one of these drips, which originated far from where it now sits.”

Needless to say, this is certainly an example of “slow and steady wins the race”—at least when it comes to forming the continents. According to Gernon, there is still a lot to learn about how the continents came to be arranged in the way we see them today. 

“Even though the surface shows little sign of ongoing tectonics, deep below, the consequences of ancient rifting are still playing out,” he explained in the release. “The legacy of continental breakup on other parts of the Earth system may well be far more pervasive and long-lived than we previously realised.”

Mitochondria, the tiny organelles without which our bodies would be deprived of energy, are gradually revealing their mysteries. In a new study published in Nature Neuroscience, researchers from Inserm and the University of Bordeaux at the NeuroCentre Magendie, in collaboration with researchers from the Université de Moncton in Canada, have for the first time succeeded in establishing a causal link between mitochondrial dysfunction and the cognitive symptoms associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

Thanks to the creation of a specific and unprecedented tool, they succeeded in increasing mitochondrial activity in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, where they observed an improvement in memory deficit symptoms. While these are only initial results, they open the door to considering mitochondria as a new therapeutic target.

The mitochondrion is a small intracellular organelle that provides the energy needed by the cell to function properly. The brain is one of the most energy-demanding organs, and neurons rely on the energy produced by mitochondria to communicate with one another. Indeed, when mitochondrial activity is impaired, neurons do not have the energy required to function correctly.

Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a progressive impairment of neuronal functions leading to the death of brain cells. In Alzheimer's disease, for example, it has been observed that neuronal degeneration, which precedes cell death, is accompanied by impaired mitochondrial activity. However, due to the lack of suitable tools, it has been difficult in the past to determine whether mitochondrial alterations play a causal role in these conditions or are simply a consequence of the pathophysiological process.

In this new study, researchers from Inserm and the Université de Bordeaux, in collaboration with researchers from the Université de Moncton in Canada, developed for the first time a tool that allows to temporarily stimulate mitochondrial activity. They hypothesized that if this stimulation led to an improvement of symptoms in animals, this would mean that the impairment of mitochondrial activity precedes the loss of neurons in the context of a neurodegenerative disease.

In previous studies, the research teams already described the specific role of G proteins[1] in the modulation of mitochondrial activity in the brain. In the present paper, the researchers succeeded in generating an artificial receptor, called mitoDreadd-Gs, able to activate G proteins directly in the mitochondria, thereby stimulating mitochondrial activity. The stimulation of mitoDreadd-Gs in the brain led to the normalisation of both mitochondrial activity and memory performance of dementia mouse models.

""This work is the first to establish a cause-and-effect link between mitochondrial dysfunction and symptoms related to neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that impaired mitochondrial activity could be at the origin of the onset of neuronal degeneration,"" explains Giovanni Marsicano, Inserm research director and co-senior author of the study.

""These results will need to be extended, but they allow us to better understand the important role of mitochondria in the proper functioning of our brain. Ultimately, the tool we developed could help us identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for dementia and facilitate the development of effective therapeutic targets,"" explains Étienne Hébert Chatelain, professor at the Université de Moncton and co-senior author of the study.

""Our work now consists of trying to measure the effects of continuous stimulation of mitochondrial activity to see whether it impacts the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases and, ultimately, delays neuronal loss or even prevents it if mitochondrial activity is restored,"" added Luigi Bellocchio, Inserm researcher and co-senior author of the study.

In a moonshot move, AI search engine Perplexity has offered to buy Chrome from Google for $34.5 billion cash in an unsolicited offer, Reuters reported, and Perplexity has confirmed to TechCrunch.

Perplexity tells TC the terms of the offer include a commitment to keep Chrome's underlying engine, Chromium, open source and continue to invest in it. Perplexity's offer includes a promise to invest $3 billion into the open source project.

Perplexity is also promising not to change the user defaults of Chrome users, including the default search engine. That is, Perplexity is promising to leave Google as the search engine rather than making its own AI-powered option the default. 

Google could not be reached for comment. TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds. 

This bid comes after the Department of Justice proposed in March that Google be forced to sell Chrome after a judge ruled the tech giant acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search. Google has not agreed to sell Chrome and has vowed to fight the ruling. 

The Perplexity spokesperson believes the court will soon set terms for remedies, perhaps later this month. (Google is also fighting another federal case where the judge ruled it illegally monopolized adtech, and the DOJ is proposing Google be forced to divest two of its adtech products or otherwise break up its ad business.)

When the DOJ first proposed that Google divest Chrome, both OpenAI and Perplexity expressed interest in buying it. Given that Chrome is the dominant browser, with 68% marketshare according to Statcounter, if the court rules Chrome must be sold, no doubt others worldwide would want to bid as well.

Interestingly, the CEO of rival search engine DuckDuckGo testified in April that Chrome could be worth “upwards of $50 billion,” Bloomberg reported at the time. Should Perplexity's offer succeed, it could be considered a bargain. 

Still, this offer for Chrome is far more than Perplexity has raised from investors and more than the startup's current valuation. Perplexity has raised about $1.5 billion to date, PitchBook estimates, including an extension round of $100 million raised last month that valued it at $18 billion, Bloomberg reported.

In the meantime, Perplexity last month launched its own browser, called Comet, in its bid to grow its AI search business without having to serve its customers through a browser, particularly one owned by its main rival Google.

And, by the way, last month, Perplexity also reportedly submitted a bid to merge with TikTok.

Hackers claim to have compromised the computer of a North Korean government hacker and leaked its contents online, offering a rare window into a hacking operation by the notoriously secretive nation. 

The two hackers, who go by Saber and cyb0rg, published a report about the breach in the latest issue of Phrack magazine, a legendary cybersecurity e-zine that was first published in 1985. The latest issue was distributed at the Def Con hackers conference in Las Vegas last week.

In the article, the two hackers wrote that they were able to compromise a workstation containing a virtual machine and a virtual private server belonging to the hacker, whom they call “Kim.” The hackers claim Kim works for the North Korean government espionage group known as Kimsuky, also known as APT43 and Thallium. The hackers leaked the stolen data to DDoSecrets, a nonprofit collective that stores leaked datasets in the public interest.

Kimsuky is a prolific advanced persistent threat (APT) group widely believed to be working inside North Korea's government, targeting journalists and government agencies in South Korea and elsewhere, and other targets that could be of interest for North Korea's intelligence apparatus. 

As is usual with North Korea, Kimsuky also conducts operations more akin to a cybercriminal group — for example, stealing and laundering cryptocurrencies to fund North Korea's nuclear weapons program. 

This hack gives an almost-unprecedented look inside the operation of Kimsuky, given that the two hackers compromised one of the group's members, rather than investigating a data breach as cybersecurity researchers and companies typically have to rely on.

“It shows a glimpse how openly ‘Kimsuky' cooperates with Chinese [government hackers] and shares their tools and techniques,” the hackers wrote.

Obviously, what Saber and cyb0rg did is technically a crime, although they will likely never be prosecuted for it, considering North Korea is sanctioned up to its eyeballs. The two hackers clearly believe Kimsuky members deserve to be exposed and embarrassed.

“Kimsuky, you're not a hacker. You are driven by financial greed, to enrich your leaders, and to fulfill their political agenda. You steal from others and favour your own. You value yourself above the others: You are morally perverted,” the two wrote in Phrack. “You hack for all the wrong reasons.”

Saber and cyb0rg claim to have found evidence of Kimsuky compromising several South Korean government networks and companies, email addresses, and hacking tools used by the Kimsuky group, internal manuals, passwords, and more data. 

Emails sent to the addresses allegedly belonging to the hackers, which were listed in the research, went unanswered. 

The hackers wrote that they were able to identify Kim as a North Korean government hacker, thanks to “artifacts and hints” that pointed in that direction, including files configurations and domains previously attributed to the North Korean hacking group Kimsuky. 

The hackers also noted Kim's “strict office hours, always connecting at around 09:00 and disconnecting by 17:00 Pyongyang time.”

Just a week after OpenAI announced it would offer ChatGPT Enterprise to the entire federal executive branch workforce at $1 per year per agency, Anthropic has raised the stakes. The AI giant said Tuesday it would also offer its Claude models to government agencies for just $1 — but not only to the executive branch. Anthropic is targeting “all three branches” of the U.S. government, including the legislative and judiciary branches. 

The package will be available for one year, says Anthropic.

The move comes after OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind were added to the General Services Administration's list of approved AI vendors that can sell their services to civilian federal agencies. TechCrunch has reached out to Google to see if it plans to respond to Anthropic's and OpenAI's challenges in kind.

Anthropic's escalation — a response to OpenAI's attempt to undercut the competition — is a strategic play meant to broaden the company's foothold in federal AI usage. 

“We believe the U.S. public sector should have access to the most advanced AI capabilities to tackle complex challenges, from scientific research to constituent services,” Anthropic said in a statement. “By combining broad accessibility with uncompromising security standards, we're helping ensure AI serves the public interest.”

Anthropic will offer both Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government. The latter supports FedRAMP High workloads so that federal workers can use Claude for handling sensitive unclassified work, according to the company. 

FedRAMP High is a stringent security baseline within the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) for handling unclassified sensitive government data. 

Anthropic will also provide technical support to help agencies integrate AI tools into their workflows, according to the company. 

Anthropic, along with OpenAI, xAI, and Google, has been granted up to $200 million by the Department of Defense to leverage AI for national security, but the AI firm clearly hopes to integrate into a broader array of government work, including science research and health services. Anthropic noted in its press release that Claude is already being used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to accelerate scientific discoveries, and also by the District of Columbia Department of Health to help residents access health services in multiple languages. 

Anthropic says it is able to make such deployments because Claude “meets the government's highest security standards.” Aside from being certified for FedRAMP High, customers can access Claude through their existing secure infrastructure via partnerships with AWS, Google Cloud, and Palantir, giving them more control over their data. 

Anthropic's multicloud access could give it an edge in the competition with OpenAI, whose current official FedRAMP High offering is tied to Azure Government Cloud only. While Azure is widely adopted in government, some government agencies and security teams might prioritize data sovereignty, infrastructure control, and the operational flexibility a multicloud strategy offers. 

OpenAI is, however, actively working to reduce its reliance on Azure so it can embrace a more diversified infrastructure approach.

In early 2023, David Petrou, a distinguished engineer and founding member of both Google Goggles and Google Glass, made a surprising move. After more than 17 years at the company, he departed to launch his own startup.

“I was seeing how fast technology was changing, and I felt there are certain ideas that are best explored in the context of a startup,” Petrou told TechCrunch.

His ultimate idea was to build Continua, a consumer-facing company that uses AI agents to enhance collaboration and interaction in group chats on SMS, iMessage, and Discord.

“The simple way to think about it is that we're bringing the power of LLMs to group chats,” Petrou said.

Continua announced on Tuesday that it has raised an $8 million seed round. The funding was led by GV, with additional participation from Bessemer Ventures Partners and a group of angel investors.

When developing Continua, Petrou noticed that people would interact with ChatGPT or another LLM, and then would copy and paste what they learned into their group conversation.

“If you and I are planning a trip, or if we're trying to figure out what to have for dinner, or what movie to watch, all of these things can be facilitated by an LLM participating in a group chat with us,” Petrou said.

Continua claims its AI agents can reduce group chat chaos by joining conversations and offering helpful information only when it's needed.

As the group discusses projects and common plans, Continua can automatically set reminders, launch polls, add calendar invitations, or generate Google documents with checklists and to-do lists.

If a user forgets details from the group chat, such as the meeting time or location, they can simply direct message Continua to privately ask for the information.

At first glance, Continua may seem like a straightforward application of AI, but Petrou says that getting LLMs to participate in a conversation with multiple humans is a rather complex technical problem. Since most AI models are designed for conversations between a single person and a single assistant, Continua had to fine-tune its technology to understand the dynamics of group chat discussions.

For instance, group members do not need Continua to respond to everything they write.

“You want the agent to have social intelligence,” Petrou said. He added that they had to “break the LLM's brain” to naturally integrate the AI into conversations.

Users can invoke Continua when they need its help or tell the agent to “hang back” if it's chiming in too often.

Users can get started with Continua by adding its phone number to a group SMS or its username to a Discord chat.

While several companies, including Meta and the startup Hey Umai, offer AI agents for conversations, Petrou insists that Continua is most suitable for group interactions.

Erik Nordlander, a general partner at GV, said his firm invested in Petrou even before the concept of Continua's group chat AI had fully taken shape. “David is a really brilliant engineer, someone who's been working with AI since before it was the hot thing.”

According to Nordlander, Continua has several potential paths to profitability. The agent is already assisting with event planning and trip booking, which he suggested they could charge for in the future.

It's still cheaper than Sonnet, but certainly not by 10x. Sonnet, arguably, is still better than GPT-5, although not by much and not in all circumstances.I read analysis that GPT-5 is better at debugging (super important) and following exact instructions (many people don't quite know what they are asking for anyway, so this could be counter-productive in many cases).So no, OpenAI did not burn the boats...(Ok, this is for coding only.

But why on earth would you not use proper case for your words? ai is difficult to read as everybody else on the planet uses AI! Even the sentences feel weird without their uppercase at their beginning. (At least the final sentence dots were there…)

reply

Also I have not seen any evidence that OpenAI is pivoting to advertising. And even if they did I'm doubtful that advertising would pay the bills. This is one of the reasons Google did not originally pursue LLMs despite having the technology.

reply

To be profitable, OpenAI would need to be 1/10th as good as Meta or Google are at monetizing via ads.

Plus: the US has paused China tariffs again

This is today's edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology.

Meet the early-adopter judges using AI

The propensity for AI systems to make mistakes that humans miss has been on full display in the US legal system as of late. The follies began when lawyers submitted documents citing cases that didn't exist. Similar mistakes soon spread to other roles in the courts. Last December, a Stanford professor submitted sworn testimony containing hallucinations and errors in a case about deepfakes, despite being an expert on AI and misinformation himself.Now, judges are experimenting with generative AI too. Some believe that with the right precautions, the technology can expedite legal research, summarize cases, draft routine orders, and overall help speed up the court system, which is badly backlogged in many parts of the US. Are they right to be so confident in it? Read the full story.

What you may have missed about GPT-5

OpenAI's new GPT-5 model was supposed to give a glimpse of AI's newest frontier. It was meant to mark a leap toward the “artificial general intelligence” that tech's evangelists have promised will transform humanity for the better. 

Against those expectations, the model has mostly underwhelmed. But there's one other thing to take from all this. Among other suggestions for potential uses of its models, OpenAI has begun explicitly telling people to use them for health advice. It's a change in approach that signals the company is wading into dangerous waters. Read the full story.

An American teenager is currently stuck in Antarctica after illegally landing his single-engine airplane in Chilean territory.

19-year-old Ethan Guo, who was in the midst of navigating a trip around the world when he landed at the world's southernmost pole, has been stuck in the icy region since June, according to the Associated Press. Upon landing, local officials charged Guo with providing them with “false flight plan information” and landing without authorization. Since then, he has been staying at a military base while he awaits movement on the court case, AP writes.

Unlike the exploits of many other influencers, Guo's stunt does seem to have involved a noble goal: the young American wants to become the youngest person to fly to all seven continents, while also collecting donations for childhood cancer research along the way. The teen's “Flight Against Cancer” has so far raised $131,000, according to the St. Jude fundraiser page associated with the effort. Guo has said that he hopes to raise over $1 million, which will go to St. Jude's Children's Hospital.

On Monday,  the charges against Guo were dropped as part of an agreement between his lawyers and Chile's prosecutors, the AP writes.  To avoid a trial, the agreement requires that Guo donate $30,000 to a children's cancer foundation within 30 days, the outlet says. He is also required to leave the country as soon as conditions allow, and he is not to return to Chile for a period of three years. Gizmodo reached out to Guo through his Instagram for comment.

At the time that he became stranded, Guo had already finished much of his journey, having traversed six of the world's continents, the BBC reports.

According to Guo's fundraiser, he originally began learning to fly when he was 13. He subsequently became interested in beating the world record for youngest person to fly to all seven continents. “Unfortunately, my cousin, who is the same age as me, developed stage 4 Hodgkin's lymphoma. As a young man, I watched the disease affect the people closest to me, such as my grandparents and aunts, little by little,” Guo wrote. “Since then, I decided to do what I could for Cancer research. In order to raise funds for research and international awareness, I decided that by breaking the record, I could get the necessary attention to influence and help as many people as possible who are suffering from the disease.”

It's unclear when Guo will be heading back to the U.S. He has said that, when he is released, he hopes to continue his trip around the world. “I remain in Antarctica awaiting approval for my departure flight,” the teen told the Associated Press on Monday. “I sincerely hope they give it to me soon so that I and my plane can continue with my original mission.”

Nintendo wants all the games coming to its Switch 2 to emphasize the features that make it distinct from the original Switch. After all, why else would consumers drop $450 on a new handheld when many are still holding onto their 8-year-old device? If you were twiddling your thumbs waiting for developers to port your favorite games to the Switch 2, know that they may be coming, but only after developers can show they'll emphasize the new system's best—or at least distinctive—qualities.

Over the last few months, murmurs from the developer community have hinted Nintendo has held back dev kits from some studios, and now we have a better idea why. In now-deleted posts to its LinkedIn page, Poland-based studio Lynxbyte shared what Nintendo wants from developers in order to receive a dev kit to port their games. YouTuber Doctre81 shared these posts from LynxByte in a video, and the LinkedIn posts have already made the rounds on Bluesky.

If LynxByte's explanation is correct, then Nintendo isn't interested if a game already runs on the original Switch. The entire point is to show off the Switch 2's capabilities. Nintendo “prioritizes” games that “take advantage” of the Switch 2's hardware. This could be showing off games running at 4K resolution and 60 fps or titles that support the Joy-Con 2 mouse mode. The more developers can emphasize features, including GameChat for quick and dirty video calls or even improved rumble in the official controllers, the greater their chances at securing a dev kit. Nintendo individually approves companies and greenlights titles. Partner studios obviously get the fast-lane treatment.

Nintendo's latest Direct game showcases haven't left us with many surprises. Many of the games in the most recent Indie World Showcase emphasized they were coming to the original Switch, rather than Switch 2. Upcoming titles like Mina the Hollower, Content Warning, and Ball X Pit will be emphasized for both platforms, though you'll still be able to play any OG Switch titles on the sequel handheld. Games like Glaciered will be exclusive to Switch 2. The July 31 Nintendo Direct showcased ports of games like Persona 3 Reload and Apex Legends as exclusive to Switch 2. It's unclear how those games or new titles like 007: First Light are embellishing the Switch 2's features, but likely it will be in performance as well as Joy-Con 2 mouse controls.

The details revealed by LynxByte also revealed extra information we didn't know about Nintendo's handheld, despite having it in hand for more than two months. We were already well aware the Switch 2 supports Nvidia's deep learning super sampling tech, or DLSS, for AI upscaling. DLSS takes frames rendered at a lower resolution and bumps them up to a higher resolution while enhancing the overall frame rate. We just didn't know what version of DLSS the Switch 2 was using. The leaks show Nintendo's Nvidia-made chipset supports DLSS 3.1, which first launched in 2023. That's the version before the advent of DLSS 3.5 with enhanced ray-traced lighting techniques and the current DLSS 4 with improved “neural” upscaling. The latest version of Nvidia's upscaler uses trained AI models to make textures and geometry look sharper compared to previous versions.

This all checks out, as leaked Switch 2 specs support Nvidia and Nintendo's joint choice to go with Ampere-level graphics performance that was first introduced back in 2020. You could compare the Switch 2's performance to the lower-end GeForce RTX 30-series cards, which is impressive enough for a handheld. We've seen ports like Cyberpunk 2077 perform even better than their counterparts on handhelds like the Steam Deck. Other ports like Street Fighter 6 also run at a steady clip.

Then there are anticipated ports of titles like Star Wars Outlaws, which is set to launch on Switch 2 on Sept 4. Some fans watching the July 31 Direct were flabbergasted by the trailer's muddy textures, lower detail, and odd visual hiccups that made the game look worse than it appeared on PC or PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X. Ubisoft RedLynx, which is working with the original game developers Massive Entertainment, mentioned it had added extra features like touch controls in certain minigames to “enhance immersion.” While we have to wait to see if the port can match the performance of Cyberpunk 2077, it's clear that adding those Switch 2 exclusive features was a big reason this port is coming sooner than others.

Asus and Noctua have finally launched their fifth collaborative graphics card, the GeForce RTX 5080 Noctua Edition, originally teased at Computex 2025. Following prior models based on the RTX 30 and 40 series, this new iteration introduces a significant redesign that includes the first-ever triple 120x25mm fan setup on a gaming GPU, employing Noctua's next-generation NF-A12x25 G2 fans alongside a thoroughly custom-engineered heatsink.

The cooling system integrates an extensive vapor chamber with eleven heatpipes—seven 8 mm and four 6 mm, a notable increase from previous Noctua Editions, which typically featured fewer heatpipes and smaller heatsinks. This design aims to balance efficient thermal dissipation with minimized acoustic output. Our review of the Noctua Editiorn RTX 3080 already praised the design from back then, so we expect this to be even better. Check out the official introduction video, which goes over every aspect of the card in detail:

Noctua's new NF-A12x25 G2 fans incorporate advanced aerodynamic features such as Progressive Bend impellers and SupraTorque motors designed to maintain high airflow and static pressure in demanding environments like large heatsinks. The fans are deliberately offset in rotational speed—arranged in an A-B-A sequence with speed variations of roughly ±50 RPM—to mitigate acoustic phenomena like beat frequencies and periodic vibrations.

Asus' internal testing at a 360W power target using FurMark stress tests reportedly showed the Noctua Edition achieved GPU temperatures of approximately 57°C and VRAM temperatures near 52°C, with noise levels measured at 21.4 dB(A). These figures would represent a substantial noise reduction—about 14.5 dB(A) less—compared to Asus's own ROG Astral RTX 5080 variant, while maintaining similar or lower operating temperatures. When fan speeds were artificially limited to 500 RPM, the Noctua Edition remained the quietest option tested and maintained temperatures well below the GPU's thermal limits.



The card supports Asus' 0dB semi-passive fan control, which shuts off the fans entirely under 50°C GPU temperature, allowing for silent operation during light workloads. Additionally, there's a dual BIOS switch that enables users to toggle between a quieter fan curve or a performance mode emphasizing the lowest possible temperatures. Asus' GPU Tweak III software will allow further customization of fan curves and undervolting to fine-tune noise and thermal performance.

Physically, the RTX 5080 Noctua Edition is considerably larger than standard models, extending 385 mm in length and occupying nearly four slots due to the thick triple-fan assembly and enlarged heatsink. This size makes it incompatible with many mid-tower cases and necessitates careful system planning.

Clock speeds on the Noctua Edition are set with a boost clock of 2700 MHz, modestly above the Founders Edition's 2600 MHz but below some factory-overclocked variants, reflecting Asus' apparent focus on thermals and acoustics over maximum out-of-the-box frequencies. The card also features phase-change thermal pads aimed at improved longevity and consistent thermal performance, addressing issues like pump-out and dry-out associated with traditional thermal pastes.

Asus' collaboration with Noctua dates back several generations, with earlier models on the RTX 3080 and RTX 4080 lines gaining attention for their unique brown fan design and quieter operation compared to competing variants. Each iteration has gradually introduced refinements in cooling architecture and fan technology, culminating in the current RTX 5080 Noctua Edition's triple-fan configuration and advanced heatsink design. Noctua already makes some of the best coolers on the market, so this GPU should carry forward the company's reliable legacy.

While the card's technical approach delivers measurable reductions in noise and heat under stress, the tradeoffs include its considerable physical footprint and a boost clock that does not aggressively push performance limits compared to other RTX 5080 models. Availability and pricing for the ASUS GeForce RTX 5080 Noctua Edition have not been announced, but the card is available for £1,500 on Scan, that's about 50% more expensive than MSRP.

A new OLED gaming monitor seems to appear every week, with models ranging from 27 inches and larger, along with ultra wides and even the occasional jumbo screen. Asus has already populated its ROG Swift and Strix lines with these lovelies, and I have here the newest example, the XG32UCWMG. This bracelet-worthy character string refers to a 32-inch 4K panel that runs at 240 Hz, 480 Hz in FHD resolution, and includes FreeSync Premium Pro, G-Sync compatibility, HDR10 with DisplayHDR 400 and wide gamut color. Let's take a look.

The XG32UCWMG is a WOLED panel with a very glossy front layer. WOLED, or White OLED uses a single OLED pixel with RGB color filters. A micro lens array pumps up brightness to a claimed 1,300 nits for HDR content. The front layer is optically pure and still manages to prevent reflections from spoiling the image. Though it has the same infinite contrast sported by any OLED, this special glass delivers greater clarity.

The native refresh rate is 240 Hz in 4K, and you get a dual mode switch for 480 Hz at FHD resolution. If you're a frame rate junkie, it doesn't get much faster unless you go with a smaller LCD panel running at 500 or 540 Hz. This isn't the first dual-mode monitor I've seen, and in the comparison tests, I'll show you three more examples that produce some interesting results.

The one thing missing here is Quantum Dots, which are the way to an even larger color gamut. Most examples cover 110% of DCI-P3 or more, but the XG32UCWMG is no slouch in the saturation department. In my tests, it was just a hair less than 100% which is very colorful indeed. Accuracy is there too with no need for calibration. If your needs run to photography and video production, there are optional color space modes available.

The full suite of GamePlus options is here with aiming points, sniper mode, timers, frame counter and display alignment marks. The refresh rate switch can be done with two clicks once it's set up in Windows and you can program the joystick clicks to a variety of often-used commands. You also get LED lighting in the back with Asus' cool Lite-Brite ROG logo that lights up in any desired color. Asus' Display Widget Center desktop allows full control without the need for the OSD. Extensive screen care options include a proximity sensor that blanks the screen when the user leaves their desk and logo and border protection along with pixel orbit and panel refresh. Asus backs the XG32UCWMG with a three-year warranty.

The XG32UCWMG arrived packed with crumbly foam in its three component parts. The base is a new small footprint design that looks diminutive but is a substantial metal plate that is more than capable of keeping everything upright. The stand assembles with a captive bolt and snaps onto the panel. The power supply is a small external brick. The cable bundle comes in a nice, zippered pouch and includes USB and DisplayPort. You also get a microfiber cleaning cloth and a large sheet of Asus ROG decals.

The XG32UCWMG is impressive from the front for two reasons. One, that glossy layer is a real thing. From the moment you turn it on, you can see its superior optical properties. Clarity is extremely high as is color saturation. There are no Quantum Dots here, but honestly, it's hard to tell. The second thing I noticed was the super thin bezel. This is common with OLEDs, but Asus has managed to get the top and side borders down to just 8mm. The panel is super thin with a component bulge in Asus' classic two-piece design. The panel's minimum thickness is just 5mm with a metal backing. The bulge adds a bit of size, making the total depth 2.8 inches.

The back features a large ROG logo made from colored pixels that remind me of the Lite-Brite toy from the 1970s. It's a cool aesthetic that I've seen on many of the newest ROG displays. You can light it up in different colors and play effects like flashing and breathing. It can also coordinate with on-screen action when Display Widget Center is installed.

The stand is rock solid with a small base designed to minimize the XG32UCWMG's footprint. It looks small in the photos, but in practice, the monitor ain't goin' nowhere. It's an improvement over the very wide and deep leg-style bases from Asus' past. Just above the cable hole, you can see a small protrusion from the screen with a backlit ROG logo. Behind this is a joystick and two control keys. The left one is preset to make the frame rate switch. More on that later.

Ergonomics include 5/20 degrees tilt, 15 degrees swivel and 4.3 inches of height adjustment. There is no portrait mode. If you'd rather use an arm, a 100mm VESA mount is provided along with a substantial steel bracket; however, no fasteners are included.

The input panel is underneath in the usual position and splits on either side of the upright. One side has two HDMI 2.1 and a DisplayPort 1.4 with Display Stream Compression (DSC). The other side has USB 3.2, one up and three downstream ports and a USB-C which can replicate a second DisplayPort. Everything is supported by KVM functions in the OSD where you can bind USB and video ports together to control multiple systems from a single set of peripherals.

The XG32UCWMG's OSD will be familiar to any Asus ROG display owner. It's a high contrast design with red accents and white text on a black background arranged in a tree with nine sub-menus.

The XG32UCWMG starts with the Gaming menu and its collection of video processing and play aids. At the top is Frame Rate Boost, which is a simple toggle between UHD/240 Hz and FHD/480 Hz. You'll need to set it up once in Nvidia Control Panel for G-Sync systems or AMD Graphic Control for FreeSyncers. Then, it's just two clicks to switch between modes, first the left button, then the joystick.

The full suite of GamePlus features is included, with aiming points, six sniper magnifications, timers, stopwatch, frame counter (number or graph) and display alignment marks. GameVisual is Asus' term for picture modes and there are nine in total. Racing is the default and best choice for all applications and does not require calibration.

The Image menu has luminance control and a Uniform Brightness toggle. For most productivity apps, leaving this on makes the image more consistent and less fatiguing. When it's off, highlights become brighter, up to around 450 nits at maximum brightness. In HDR mode, it's even brighter still with 25% window patterns measuring around 735 nits and 1% windows topping 1,300 nits. Additionally, OLED Anti-Flicker prevents artifacts from creeping in during rapid frame rate changes. HDR signals get four dedicated picture modes and include the option to adjust brightness and contrast. Gaming HDR is the most dynamic option while True Black is the most accurate.

Color settings include selectable gamuts, sRGB, and DCI-P3. The latter refers to the DisplayP3 standard with 2.2 gamma and D65 white point. To calibrate, there are color temp presets and a user mode with RGB sliders. You can also pick from five gamma presets and adjust saturation for all six colors.

OLED Care options are extensive and include screen dimming, logo protection, pixel orbiter and pixel refresh. A front-mounted sensor can be engaged to turn the screen off when you leave your desk. To view two video sources at once, there's PIP and PBP with a single split option (50/50) and corner positions and sizing for the PIP window. The lighting in the back can be controlled with various colors and effects, or you can tweak it with Asus Display Widget Center app.

The joystick directions and selector can be programmed for the most-used functions, such as input select or GameVisual. The left button defaults to Frame Rate Boost, which is the easiest way to switch refresh rates between 240 and 480 Hz. Customized Setting lets you save your configurations for later recall. In the KVM menu, you can bind USB and video ports so multiple systems like a PC and console can be controlled from a single keyboard and mouse.

The XG32UCWMG's Racing mode is very color-accurate out of the box and can be enjoyed without calibration. The full color gamut will be used for all content, covering around 100% of DCI-P3. If you want sRGB, the best choice is to use the Display Color Space option in the Color menu rather than the dedicated sRGB mode because it retains all the image adjustment options. I made one change to the red slider but left gamma on its default setting. The table below shows my recommendations plus brightness values for Uniform Brightness on or off.

For HDR signals, there are four dedicated modes. True Black is the closest to standard but if you want maximum brightness in the highlight zones, choose Gaming HDR. It will peak at around 1,300 nits in a 1% window. Turning on Adjustable HDR gives you access to the brightness and contrast sliders, plus the Uniform Brightness toggle.

My first order of business was to set up the Frame Rate Boost, AKA dual refresh operation. I opened Nvidia Control Panel and set the max refresh rate for 4K at 240 Hz, then pressed the button for 480 Hz, then returned to NCP and set the refresh to 480 Hz. This only needs to be done once; then the XG32UCWMG will switch back and forth with two button clicks after a brief delay. I noted that HDR worked fine in either mode. I also noted that you can't switch while you're in a game. The resolution change plays havoc with the graphics, and I had to shell out to the Windows desktop to recover. Just pick your mode before loading the game and you'll be fine.

So, does it make a difference? The reduced resolution is certainly obvious when going from 138ppi to 69ppi pixel density. Yes, the frame rate increases greatly. In my case, running a GeForce RTX 4090 in Doom Eternal means 220-240fps in 4K and 350-420fps in Full HD. But at 220fps in UHD, there is no motion blur or perceptible delay whatsoever. Only a slower video card will benefit from the 480 Hz mode. The higher frame rate does nothing for the gaming experience when you can run over 200fps in 4K.

And that is a revelation, especially in HDR mode, where the image is just stunning. The XG32UCWMG's glossy front layer provides an obvious optical benefit. The picture is so sharp, I almost cut myself. Highlights are incredibly textural and bright, yet there is perfect balance over the entire dynamic range. I also did not miss the Quantum Dot color. The picture is so good that I can't imagine giving up that glossy screen for 10% more gamut coverage.

Of course, video processing is flawless. G-Sync operated perfectly, and I never saw any artifacts, stutter or blur. It really can't get better than this. Response is incredibly fast, and certainly quick enough for the highest levels of competition. On-screen movement almost seemed to anticipate my control inputs.

The XG32UCWMG is equally capable as a workday monitor. You won't find better image quality than OLED and this is one of the best. That is by a small margin, as I have yet to review an OLED I didn't love. This monitor does stand out a bit, though, with that glossy screen. I also appreciated the flexibility offered by Uniform Brightness. All OLEDs should have this feature, but many do not. I recommend turning it on for work and turning it off for gaming and entertainment. And HDR content should be viewed in the Gaming HDR mode. It's the most dynamic and textural of the four choices.

The XG32UCWMG convenience features like GamePlus's aiming points and KVM peripheral management are pluses for sure. The extra USB ports were welcome, and I enjoyed the LED feature on the back. My only wish was for internal speakers but donning a pair of headphones took care of that.

Takeaway: The XG32UCWMG is a premium monitor in every respect. Whether you want it for gaming or work or both, it delivers at the highest level of image quality and performance. It reinforces the mantra, “you never regret buying the best.”

""The current water shortfall situation in England now defined as a 'nationally significant incident.'""

The UK government has instructed citizens to delete old emails and pictures to help conserve water, following the announcement of a ""nationally significant"" water shortage. However, the advice isn't up to snuff, as deleting emails and pictures should have no significant effect on water consumption, and might even make it worse for data centers that use certain types of evaporative cooling.

Guidance published Tuesday states ""the current water shortfall situation in England is now defined as a 'nationally significant incident.'"" Five areas of the country are officially in drought, with six more experiencing prolonged dry weather following the six driest months leading up to July since 1976. According to the report, rivers and reservoir levels continue to recede, and August isn't looking much wetter.

Naturally, the government is trying to encourage citizens to save water, and lists a number of very reasonable actions concerned residents can take to reduce their water usage. Measures such as collecting rainwater, fixing a leaky toilet, and using wastewater to water plants, alongside reducing shower times and not watering your lawn, can help reduce water usage. Finally, the article states, ""Delete old emails and pictures as data centres require vast amounts of water to cool their systems.""

As some onlookers have noted, the recommendation rings a little hollow when juxtaposed next to the UK government's commitment to turbocharge growth using AI. Perhaps more pertinently, the advice rings hollow because it's likely not very sensible. While it's true that data centers do consume large amounts of water through evaporative cooling (where it's used), the vast majority of this power draw comes from CPU and GPU computation, not the storage of pictures and emails. Once the data is stored, the storage devices generate very little heat and are often spun down (placed into low- or no-power states) and called upon only when needed.

The impact of an individual deleting emails and old photos on data center water usage is likely to be so infinitesimal as to be considered futile. In fact, rooting out old emails and photos and deleting them from your online archives might well use more energy and water than storing them in the first place, making this a counterproductive exercise.

Furthermore, if the data you're deleting to try and save water is stored in a data center outside of the UK, you'll actually end up saving water (or more likely not, as we've discussed) in some other country. The UK doesn't have universal laws mandating that citizen data has to be stored within the country, so this is a real possibility.

So if you're in the UK and looking to save water during this particularly dry spell, probably best to try some of the other options first.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may augment standard language therapy to help slow the progression of primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a neurodegenerative disorder that erodes communication.

In a randomized sham-controlled clinical trial, 6 months of active intermittent theta-burst TMS

plus language therapy improved or mitigated decline in regional brain metabolism, trained language abilities, functional impairment, and neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with PPA.

The study was published online on August 11 in JAMA Network Open.

PPA is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome marked by progressive speech and/or language impairment. Most cases stem from frontotemporal degeneration or Alzheimer's disease. There are currently no effective drug treatments, although speech-language therapy has proven to be helpful.

TMS can induce changes in cortical excitability, potentially promoting the reorganization of language networks, and has shown promise as adjunctive treatment for post-stroke aphasia.

Previous studies examining the short-term effects of TMS on PPA reported “encouraging” results, but the longer-term effects, beyond more than a few weeks of intervention, have not been examined, until now.

For the study, the researchers led by Jordi Matias-Guiu, MD, PhD, with the Department of Neurology, Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain, recruited 63 adults with early-stage PPA (42 women; mean age, 72 years).

Participants were randomized (2:1) to either active intermittent theta-burst TMS or sham TMS for 6 months, immediately followed by evidence-based language therapy for PPA.

The trial consisted of a 24-week treatment that included a 2-week intensive course, in which active TMS or sham TMS combined with language therapy was applied daily, followed by a maintenance phase in which the same stimulation was applied weekly for 22 weeks. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3 months after the start of the treatment, and at the end of the treatment (6 months following baseline).

The main outcome was the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) on FDG PET imaging in the left hemisphere, assessed at baseline and at 6 months (immediately following the intervention).

The primary outcome was positive with higher adjusted mean SUVR in the active group than in the sham TMS group (0.78 vs 0.77; P = .046).

Active TMS was also associated with significant improvement on all secondary language outcomes at 6 months, including the mini linguistic state examination, with an adjusted mean difference at 6 months of 7.71 (P = .002). Patients in the sham group worsened on this measure compared with those in the active group.

Active TMS also led to improvement in confrontation naming of trained words, which improved by a mean 23.8 points in active recipients compared with sham TMS recipients.

Functional independence also benefited, with daily-living scores falling (indicating better performance) by 5.4 points in the active group compared with the sham TMS group. Neuropsychiatric symptoms eased as well, with a 4-point advantage on the neuropsychiatric inventory scale.

There were no significant differences in the number of adverse events. Adherence to treatment protocol was high (92%).

“Overall, these findings suggest that the combination of TMS and language therapy is a feasible and effective treatment option for PPA,” the researchers concluded.

They said future studies should investigate the potential for TMS paired with an evidence-based speech-language intervention to sustain or extend these benefits beyond 6 months.

This study had no commercial funding. The authors declared no relevant conflicts of interest.

Patients with autoimmune Addison disease (AAD) showed increased use of hypnotics/sedatives, anxiolytics, and antidepressants in the year before diagnosis, suggesting potential misdiagnosis of early symptoms. The elevated use of hypnotics/sedatives persisted for years after diagnosis, indicating persistent sleep disturbances in this population.

""[These] findings underscore the importance to considering somatic differential diagnoses, such as adrenal insufficiency, when a person presents with symptoms like fatigue or melancholy. Conversely, it is equally important to evaluate potential psychiatric causes in individuals with adrenal insufficiency who report excessive fatigue or melancholy,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Sara Öster, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. It was published online on August 02, 2025, in European Journal of Endocrinology.

Medication dispensations might not have reflected actual patterns of drug use. The study did not analyse prescribed daily doses, focusing instead on the annual prevalence of drug use.

This study was supported by the Centre for Clinical Research and Education, the Region Värmland County Council, and a Regional Agreement on Medical Training and Clinical Research between Stockholm County Council and Karolinska Institutet. The authors reported having no competing interests.

Electroretinography (ERG) is an ophthalmic diagnostic method used to determine whether the retina is functioning normally. It is widely employed for diagnosing hereditary retinal diseases or assessing retinal function decline.

A team of Korean researchers has developed a next-generation wireless ophthalmic diagnostic technology that replaces the existing stationary, darkroom-based retinal testing method by incorporating an ""ultrathin OLED"" into a contact lens. This breakthrough is expected to have applications in diverse fields such as myopia treatment, ocular biosignal analysis, augmented-reality (AR) visual information delivery, and light-based neurostimulation.

On the 12th, KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced that a research team led by Professor Seunghyup Yoo from the School of Electrical Engineering, in collaboration with Professor Se Joon Woo of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (Director Jeong-Han Song), Professor Sei Kwang Hahn of POSTECH (President Sung-Keun Kim) and CEO of PHI Biomed Co., and the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI, President Seungchan Bang) under the National Research Council of Science & Technology (NST, Chairman Youngshik Kim), has developed the world's first wireless contact lens-based wearable retinal diagnostic platform using organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).

This technology enables ERG simply by wearing the lens, eliminating the need for large specialized light sources and dramatically simplifying the conventional, complex ophthalmic diagnostic environment.

Traditionally, ERG requires the use of a stationary Ganzfeld device in a dark room, where patients must keep their eyes open and remain still during the test. This setup imposes spatial constraints and can lead to patient fatigue and compliances challenges.

To overcome these limitations, the joint research team integrated an ultrathin flexible OLED —approximately 12.5 μm thick, or 6-8 times thinner than a human hair— into a contact lens electrode for ERG. They also equipped it with a wireless power receiving antenna and a control chip, completing a system capable of independent operation.

For power transmission, the team adopted a wireless power transfer method using a 433 MHz resonant frequency suitable for stable wireless communication. This was also demonstrated in the form of a wireless controller embedded in a sleep mask, which can be linked to a smartphone —further enhancing practical usability.

While most smart contact lens-type light sources developed for ocular illumination have used inorganic LEDs, these rigid devices emit light almost from a single point, which can lead to excessive heat accumulation and thus usable light intensity. In contrast, OLEDs are areal light sources and were shown to induce retinal responses even under low luminance conditions. In this study, under a relatively low luminance* of 126 nits, the OLED contact lens successfully induced stable ERG signals, producing diagnostic results equivalent to those obtained with existing commercial light sources.
*Luminance: A value indicating how brightly a surface or screen emits light; for reference, the luminance of a smartphone screen is about 300-600 nits (can exceed 1000 nits at maximum).

Animal tests confirmed that the surface temperature of a rabbit's eye wearing the OLED contact lens remained below 27°C, avoiding corneal heat damage, and that the light-emitting performance was maintained even in humid environments—demonstrating its effectiveness and safety as an ERG diagnostic tool in real clinical settings.

Integrating the flexibility and diffusive light characteristics of ultrathin OLEDs into a contact lens is a world-first attempt,"" and that ""this research can help expand smart contact lens technology into on-eye optical diagnostic and phototherapeutic platforms, contributing to the advancement of digital healthcare technology.""

The world's largest conditional cash transfer programme, the Bolsa Família Programme (BFP), is associated with a substantial reduction in AIDS cases and deaths, especially among brown and black women with lower income and limited education. This was the main conclusion of a study coordinated by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), a centre supported by ""la Caixa"" Foundation, in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NAIDS/NIH). The results were published in Nature Human Behaviour.

Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs, which provide financial aid to low-income households in exchange for fulfilling health and education requirements, are a key policy tool for addressing the social determinants of health. Implemented in nearly all low- and middle-income countries, CCTs aim to improve the living conditions of families in vulnerable situations.

""We analyzed data from 2007 to 2015, focusing on mothers and daughters in households receiving Bolsa Família, using a causal inference framework and a robust quasi-experimental design,"" explains Andréa F. Silva, PhD in the Institute of Collective Health, Federal University of Bahia (UFBA) (Salvador, Brazil) and lead author of the study. The analysis covered 12.3 million low-income women, and explored how intersecting vulnerabilities - such as poverty, race, and education - affected the programme's effectiveness.

Among daughters, the programme was associated with a 47% reduction in AIDS incidence and a 55% reduction in AIDS-related mortality. Among mothers, the reductions were 42% and 43%, respectively.

The programme's impact was particularly significant among women facing multiple intersecting vulnerabilities. In particular, brown or black mothers living in extreme poverty and with higher levels of education experienced the greatest improvements: a 56% reduction in AIDS incidence. These findings suggest that education enhances the protective effects of cash transfers on health outcomes.

Brazil has already reported a national decline in AIDS, with the relative incidence dropping by nearly 30% from 2007 to 2021, and over 40% among women. This study suggests that the BFP may be one of the reasons for this success, highlighting the importance of integrated social and health policy approaches.

Beyond financial aid, the BFP includes health and education conditionalities, such as mandatory school attendance, routine health checkups, and participation in health education activities, including sexual and reproductive health, which may further support HIV prevention and treatment. By improving nutrition, reducing food insecurity, and encouraging early engagement with healthcare services, these conditions create a multi-pronged approach to disease prevention.

This is the first large-scale study to assess the intersectional effectiveness of cash transfer programmes on HIV/AIDS outcomes. By linking massive socioeconomic and health datasets, the researchers were able to evaluate the effects of the Bolsa Família Programme across diverse subpopulations, many of whom are often underrepresented in traditional epidemiological studies or clinical trials. This is particularly relevant in policy evaluation: public interventions could have a very different impact according to the characteristics and baseline conditions, and of its beneficiaries.

In the current global context of increasing inequalities and poverty rates, CCT programmes have the potential to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality from AIDS, especially among populations with multiple vulnerabilities. Our findings show that these programmes not only reduce HIV risks and AIDS-related deaths, but also support progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals in Brazil and beyond.""

USMNT prospect Kevin Paredes has suffered another injury setback and requires surgery on the broken foot that ruled him out of most of 2024-25.

The 22-year-old Wolfsburg winger had reported back fit for pre-season and featured in the Bundesliga side's initial summer friendly fixtures.

But during training he felt pain in the right foot which surgeons operated on last season, and opted for a new procedure from a Munich specialist.

Paredes, who has made three international appearances and impressed for the U.S. in their 2024 Paris Olympics campaign, was restricted to just two performances for his club last season.

He is hoping to have recovered and be available for selection again by the start of November.

This latest injury means he will miss the chance to be part of four USMNT fixtures; the upcoming games against South Korea and Japan in September, before Ecuador and Australia in October.

“It's hard to go through this again,” Paredes wrote in a statement on Instagram. “Unfortunately, I had to undergo another operation on the same foot that put me out of action last season. But I remain focused on my recovery and am determined to come back stronger. I'll be back soon, ready to give everything for my team!”

A Wolfsburg statement says the club “will have to do without the services of Kevin Paredes for the foreseeable future after the US winger had an operation on his foot on Monday.

“The procedure went smoothly and VfL would like to wish Kevin a full and speedy recovery.”

Paredes has scored three goals across 57 Wolfsburg appearances since a January 2022 switch from D.C. United.

Paredes now has less time to grab Mauricio Pochettino's attention and force his way into the World Cup squad.

He must get fit and replicate the league form of 2023-24 which saw him make 28 Bundesliga appearances, scoring three goals.

That breakthrough earned him his international call-ups under Gregg Berhalter. The versatile wide midfielder, who can play on either flank or as a wing-back, is still hoping to make up for lost time and form part of Pochettino's wide options for the national team's March warm-up games ahead of the home soil tournament that begins in June.

Real Madrid are in action for the first time since they succumbed to a 4–0 drubbing at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain at the Club World Cup.

The summer tournament has distorted Madrid's plans ahead of the 2025–26 season, with only one fixture arranged before their La Liga opener. 

The club were unsuccessful in their efforts to postpone their first game of the league season at home to Osasuna, but will have a couple of extra days to prepare with the fixture scheduled for next Tuesday. Thus, the new season will merely be a week away when they kick-off in Innsbruck. 

Xabi Alonso has named a strong travelling squad for their Austria trip, and here's how you can watch WSG Tirol vs. Real Madrid on TV and live stream.

Supporters around the world can tune into Real Madrid's sole preseason friendly of the summer via Real Madrid TV. 

The club's dedicated channel will be streaming the fixture for free on Tuesday evening. In the United States and Canada, the channel is supported by Tubi. 

For those without access to the TV channel, the friendly can also be streamed via Real Madrid Play, which is accessible on the club's website and mobile app. 

Real Madrid are a week away from the start of the 2025–26 season, with Osasuna, who finished ninth in La Liga last season and have proven to be tricky opposition in recent years, their first opponents. 

Alonso has a fairly tame start to his tenure, with his team taking on the newly-promoted Real Oviedo on Matchweek 2 before clashes against Mallorca, Real Sociedad and Espanyol. The first Madrid Derby and major test of the domestic season is scheduled for Sept. 28.

Coming Wednesday at 12:30pm ET: Designing sports venues for the modern fan

FIFA “launched the application process” for 2026 World Cup volunteers yesterday, aiming to recruit a “staggering 65,000 across the 16 cities” that will host the expanded 48-team format, according to Steve Henson of the L.A. TIMES. The tournament, set to begin June 11 and last 39 days, will feature “the largest volunteer program FIFA has ever attempted.” In addition to stadiums, volunteers will “provide support across at training sites, airports and hotels.” Those whose applications are accepted “will be invited to attend the Volunteer Team Tryouts,” which are expected to begin in October. Training will take place in March 2026 (L.A. TIMES, 8/11). The CP's Neil Davidson noted organizers say that volunteers “will provide support across 23 functional areas at official and non-official sites such as stadiums, training sites, airports, hotels and more.” Volunteers “need to be 18 or older at the time of application, be able to commit to eight shifts between June 11 and July 19, 2026, speak English (with French and Spanish also ‘desirable' in Canada and Mexico, respectively, with other languages a plus) and pass a background check, among other requirements.” While volunteers can choose their preferred city, FIFA “does not help with travel or accommodation.” The role is unpaid, although local transportation costs in the host city “may be covered” (CP, 8/11).

WHY NOT PAY? In Vancouver, Patrick Johnston writes that FIFA is “swimming in dough,” so “why not pay these people” rather than have them volunteer? It would “not break FIFA's bank if they were to turn around and pay those who will be running errands, handing out drinks and holding open doors.” Johnston: “You are paying FIFA with your time. It should be the other way around” (Vancouver PROVINCE, 8/11).","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","soccer"

Calling all soccer enthusiasts! The countdown to the World Cup has begun, and FIFA is giving fans to not just watch it but live it.

Today the application process for the FIFA World Cup 26 volunteer program was launched. This once-in-a-generation community of volunteers will help bring to life a tournament uniting three countries and billions of hearts around the world.

With around 65,000 volunteers expected to participate, the FIFA World Cup 26 Volunteer Community will be the largest volunteer program for a FIFA event to date. Given the expanded 48-team format and activity across 16 host cities over the course of six weeks, the FIFA Volunteer Community — now one million members strong and growing — will be called on to join in support of the biggest FIFA World Cup yet. Volunteers will provide support across 23 functional areas at official and non-official sites, such as stadiums, training sites, airports and hotels.

“Volunteers are the heart, soul and smile of FIFA tournaments,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino. “They get to show off their local pride, gain a behind-the-scenes view of the tournament and make memories and friendships that can last a lifetime, while supporting a historic event. We hope interested individuals will join us as we welcome the world to North America in 2026.”

With millions expected to attend the tournament in Canada, Mexico and the United States, FIFA is looking for passionate and enthusiastic volunteers to help make this FIFA World Cup an unforgettable experience for all. Volunteers are the heartbeat of FIFA events and champions of their host city—sharing their pride and passion with fans from all corners of the globe, welcoming visitors to experience the unique culture of their host city and supporting the extraordinary event that is a FIFA World Cup.

“I'm so proud to be part of this moment — not just for FIFA, but for my city,” said Craig Collins, who volunteered at the 1994 FIFA World Cup USA and the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 in Atlanta — and officially became the one millionth volunteer to join the FIFA Volunteer Community in April 2025. “I'm excited to apply for the 2026 volunteer program and hope to show off my community to the world once more.”

FIFA welcomes volunteers from all backgrounds and abilities as the organization aspires to bring people from all walks of life together to enjoy the beautiful game of football. From students to retirees, from first-timers to seasoned veterans, the FIFA World Cup 26 Volunteer Community will be made up of a diverse group of individuals united by a passion for soccer, volunteering and community.

MASON, OH − The Round of 16 field for the ATP and WTA at the Cincinnati Open will be completed Aug. 12 as the third round continues from the Lindner Family Tennis Center.

The World No. 2 from both tours will be in action Aug. 12 on Center Court. Carlos Alcaraz is slated to face Hamad Medjedovic in the second match of the day session and former Cincinnati Open champion Coco Gauff is after that against No. 32 Dayana Yastremska.

Over three hours after the start of the match, and following the rain delay, Francisco Comesana has advanced to the Round of 16 at the Cincinnati Open.

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Opelka – Comesana: 12.08.2025 17:00 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Reilly Opelka has won four of his last five matches. This week in Cincinnati, Opelka has won both matches so far in straight sets. In the second round, the American upset de Minaur in straight sets. He was great under pressure, saving all seven breakpoints. Last season in Cincinnati, he lost to Shelton in the opening round in straight sets.

Francisco Comesana has won three of his last five matches. This week in Cincinnati, Comesana has had a favourable draw so far. In the opening round, he defeated Munar in straight sets. Darderi retired mid-match against him in the second round.

According to the bookies, Comesana is the underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. He played his best tennis this week in Cincinnati. We expect him to hold his service games easily and keep this match tight.

That being said, Comesana covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Francisco Comesana +2.5 games handicap @1.83 @bet365

Popyrin – Rublev: 12.08.2025 17:00 CEST
H2H: 2-1

Alexei Popyrin has won four of his last five matches. Last week in Toronto, Popyrin had a decent run, reaching the quarterfinals. He eventually lost to Zverev in three tight sets. This week in Cincinnati, the Australian won the opening match against Landaluce in straight sets.

Andrey Rublev has won four of his last five matches. Last week in Toronto, the Russian lost to Fritz in the quarterfinals in straight sets. This week in Cincinnati, he dominated against Tien in the opening match. He won comfortably in straight sets.

According to the bookies, Popyrin is the underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. He has won the past two head-to-head meetings against Rublev in straight sets. Popyrin played well this season and will be confident coming into this matchup. We expect him to keep this match close.

That being said, Popyrin covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Alexei Popyrin +2.5 games handicap @1.83 @bet365

Medjedovic – Alcaraz: 12.08.2025 18:30 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Hamad Medjedovic has won three of his last five matches. This week in Cincinnati, the Serb won both matches in straight sets. In the second round, he defeated Griekspoor in straight sets easily.

Carlos Alcaraz has won four of his last five matches. This week in Cincinnati, the Spaniard defeated Dzumhur in three sets. He lost his serve three times in a rollercoaster-type match. Last season in Cincinnati, he lost to Monfils in the opening match in three tight sets.

According to the bookies, Medjedovic is the big underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. While we still believe Alcaraz will win this match, we expect Medjedovic to keep this match close. The Spaniard has not played many hard-court matches in the past few months. He struggled against Dzumhur and was far away from his best level.

That being said, Medjedovic covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Hamad Medjedovic +4.5 games handicap @1.83 @bet365

Goran Ivanisevic had big hopes for Elena Rybakina when he coached her earlier this year.

Ivanisevic only coached Rybakina for two tournaments, before leaving her team after the Australian Open.

Since then, Rybakina has been coached by Davide Sanguinetti, while also being in regular contact with Stefano Vukov before he was able to return to the WTA Tour from his suspension. 

Despite the coaching relationship not being particularly successful, Ivanisevic did have big hopes for Rybakina.

Rybakina won her only Grand Slam title at Wimbledon in 2022, and has been ranked as high as world number three.

However, the Kazakhstani player's recent Grand Slam results have not lived up to her potential, with Rybakina continually suffering from the same issue.

Seven months after their coaching partnership came to an end, it has now been revealed how much potential Ivanisevic actually thinks Rybakina has.

Former top five ranked players Dinara Safina and Anna Chakvetadze recently interviewed Ivanisevic for their podcast, and the former has now revealed that the Croatian told them something off podcast.

According to Chakvetadze, Ivanisevic believes that Rybakina should be winning at least three or four Wimbledon titles.

The former world number five said, “When we interviewed Goran Ivanisevic, he said off-camera ‘I don't understand, she has such an amazing game, she should be winning more tournaments on grass, not one Wimbledon but 3-4 at least.”

Anna Chakvetadze about Elena Rybakina on podcast with Dinara Safina:""When we interviewed Goran Ivanisevic, he said off-camera 'I don't understand, she has such an amazing game, she should be winning more tournaments on grass, not one Wimbledon but 3-4 at least."" pic.twitter.com/S8L20pq6rM

Rybakina actually won the Wimbledon title on just her second main draw appearance at the grass court major.

While she has reached the latter stages of Wimbledon since, Rybakina has been unable to add to her Grand Slam trophy cabinet since then.

The 2025 Championships were the worst of her career, with Rybakina losing to Clara Tauson in the third round of Wimbledon.

Rybakina's game appears to be suited to grass, but she has not won a title on the surface outside of Wimbledon in 2022.

The best results Rybakina has achieved at a grass court WTA Tour-level event came when she reached the semifinals of both the Libema Open (2019) and the Eastbourne International (2021).","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Grigor Dimitrov has officially pulled out of the upcoming US Open, having struggled with an injury since Wimbledon earlier this year. The Bulgarian had been on the verge of a famous victory over eventual champion Jannik Sinner, but was forced to retire from the round-of-16 clash and hasn't been seen in competitive action since.

Dimitrov injured his pectoral muscle in the Sinner clash and has been unable to recover from the problem in time to line up at Flushing Meadows later this month. It brings to an end a streak of 58 Slam main draws in a row, which had been the longest active streak on the ATP Tour.

As a result of Dimitrov pulling out of the US Open, Alejandro Tabilo has been named as the 34-year-old's replacement. The world No.103 has competed in both the Australian and French Open main draws this year, reaching the first and second rounds respectively.

Speaking shortly after his Wimbledon withdrawal, Dimitrov posted on social media: ""Sometimes the heart wants to keep going… but the universe has a different plan for us,"" wrote Dimitrov in a post on Instagram, which included a photo of himself in a hospital bed. Having to withdraw from this match at Wimbledon was one of the most painful moments of my career.

""Thank you for the overwhelming wave of love - from family, friends, fans, colleagues, to the entire tennis community… your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times. Thank you all. Truly. Recovery starts now. I'll see you all soon. G.""

It was initially expected that Dimitrov would recover from the injury quickly, with talk of him being involved in the North American hard-court swing. However, it transpired that the original prognosis was worse than first thought, with Dimitrov firstly withdrawing from the Canadian Open and then the Cincinnati Open.

His manager, Georgi Stoimenov, appeared to float the idea of Dimitrov not being available for the US Open last month, claiming it was unlikely he'd be fully fit. Now, just a couple of weeks before the action in New York gets underway, his absence has been confirmed by the tournament organisers.

As well as losing his impressive Grand Slam streak, it's likely Dimitrov will also fall outside of the top 30 in the ATP rankings. He will have the chance to climb back up the standings at tournaments like the China Open and Shanghai Masters, but only if the Bulgarian star is fit enough to compete.

Grigor Dimitrov, who has been battling an injury since Wimbledon earlier this year, has officially withdrawn from the upcoming US Open.

The Bulgarian tennis star was on the brink of a significant victory over eventual champion Jannik Sinner in the round-of-16 clash but had to retire and hasn't competed since. He is the latest big name to withdraw from the tournament, which will have a record-breaking prize fund on offer. 

Dimitrov sustained a pectoral muscle injury during his match against Sinner and hasn't been able to recover in time for the tournament at Flushing Meadows later this month. This ends his streak of 58 Slam main draws in a row, the longest active streak on the ATP Tour.

With Dimitrov's withdrawal from the US Open, Alejandro Tabilo has been announced as the 34 year old's replacement.

After his withdrawal from Wimbledon, Dimitrov shared on social media: ""Sometimes the heart wants to keep going... but the universe has a different plan for us,"" he wrote in an Instagram post that included a picture of him in a hospital bed.

""Withdrawing from this match at Wimbledon was one of the most painful moments of my career.

""Thank you for the overwhelming wave of love - from family, friends, fans, colleagues, to the entire tennis community... your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times. Thank you all. Truly. Recovery starts now. I'll see you all soon. G.""

Dimitrov is not the only popular name to withdraw from the tournament, with Paula Badosa also forced to pull out due to injury.

Switzerland's Jil Teichmann was upgraded to the main draw after being the top alternate to make it into the tournament. France's Alize Cornet will then occupy the top alternate pot vacated by Teichmann. Badosa announced her tough decision on social media.

DON'T MISS: 

""It is with a heavy heart that I am announcing my withdrawal from this year's U.S. Open,"" she wrote. ""This decision was incredibly difficult to make.

""After the amazing run I had in New York last year and the deep connection I feel with the city and its fans, stepping away from this tournament is very emotional for me. The U.S. Open has always meant a great deal to me, and I have created some of my most special memories there.""

""I want to thank everyone for the ongoing support,"" she continued. ""Right now I need to focus on my health and recovery so I can return stronger and ready to compete again.""

12/08/25
                            • 3 MINUTE READ
                    

Last year, British No.1 Jack Draper headed to the US Open on a hot streak, having made the quarter-finals at the Cincinnati Open just the week before.



Draper's run to the final four last year truly catapulted his status as one of the top players in the game right now. His wins over the likes of Botic van de Zandschulp, Tomas Mahac, and Alex de Minaur showed that he had the game and mentality to go deep in the major championships and challenge for the biggest titles.

Reflecting on last year's performances, despite the semi-final exit to world No.1 and eventual champion Jannik Sinner, Draper sees that run as the catalyst for what has so far been his most successful season on tour.

“Last year's US Open was amazing – I reflect on it with really positive memories. It gave me so much confidence and set me up for what was to come for the rest of the year and also the start of this year.

“Pushing through five best-of-five set matches, against the best players in the world on the biggest stages – that just gives me so much belief. It was a big moment for me and probably one of the biggest in my career so far.

“For me, the atmosphere is the best at the US Open. I love the crowd dynamic, the rowdiness, and I just really enjoy the surroundings and what it brings. It's a lively, energetic crowd, and that gets the best out of me for sure.”

Standing in his way last year and likely again this time around will be current US Open, Australian Open, and Wimbledon title-holder Sinner, alongside Roland Garros champion Carlos Alcaraz.

Sinner and Alcaraz have dominated the men's game over the last two years, lifting the last seven major titles between them and showing little sign of stopping. They have faced each other in the two most recent Grand Slams finals and are staking their claim at the summit of the sport.

Now it's up to the rest of the field to raise their game to overthrow Sinner and Alcaraz – and Draper is very much leading that charge. The Brit has defeated both players in the past and believes he has what it takes to join them at the top.



“Jannik and Carlos are the best two players in the world right now,” Draper said. “They are playing tennis, which is very exciting to watch; it's electric.

“There are no holes in their game; they are so consistent and powerful. Mentally, they are both very experienced now on the big stages, and they are both complete players. Saying that, they can still improve, so it's really exciting to be around them.

“They are leading the way, but there are players like me who are hungry to go beyond their level and will do anything to get to where they are playing. I'm looking forward to many more matchups with them to come.”

While the US Open is the last Grand Slam of the year, it's certainly not the final big trophy up for grabs over the coming months.

In November, the season will close out with the Nitto ATP Finals – bringing together the top eight singles players and doubles teams from the year to crown the final champions of 2025.

Currently, Draper is ranked No.7 in the Race to Turin, and a good showing at the US Open could book his place at the Finals for the first time in his career – a significant milestone as a reward for his impressive results this year.

“The ATP Finals is definitely something I've got my eyes on,” he admitted. “At the start of the year, it was one of my goals because if you make the Finals, you've had a very consistent season, and that was my biggest thing going into this season to maintain.

“Obviously, I've picked up an injury and missed a few tournaments, but like always, I'm going to give it my best. My preparation has been great, I keep on improving, and if I make it, great, but if I don't, life moves on, and I'll keep striving to be better.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Three-time Grand Slam semifinalist Grigor Dimitrov withdrew from the US Open on Tuesday, a little more than a month after he tore a chest muscle and had to quit playing against Jannik Sinner at Wimbledon.That exit from the All England Club on July 7—Dimitrov had taken the opening two sets against Sinner but got hurt in the third—marked the fifth consecutive Grand Slam tournament where the 34-year-old Dimitrov failed to complete a match. It also happened at the Australian Open in January and the French Open in May, plus last year's Wimbledon and US Open.A year ago in New York, Dimitrov stopped while trailing 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3, 4-1 against Frances Tiafoe in the quarterfinals.

Olympic champion Monica Puig welcomed her first child, daughter Mila, with husband Nathan. Puig, who retired from tennis due to injuries, announced her pregnancy in February. Mila arrived just before the anniversary of Puig's historic gold medal win.

2016 Olympic champion Monica Puig recently announced that her first child, daughter Mila, was born at the end of July.

The 31-year-old former World No. 27 confessed that she ""never knew a love like this existed"" before welcoming Mila Alexandra Rakitt to the world with her husband of nearly three years, Nathan, on July 30. 

In February, Puig announced she was pregnant -- after retiring from tennis in the summer of 2022 due to the cumulative toll of injuries -- and Mila joined the family just about two weeks prior to the nine-year anniversary of her mother's history-making gold medal triumph in Brazil. In 2016, as a 22-year-old, an unseeded Puig famously stormed through the draw to win Puerto Rico's first-ever Olympic gold medal. 

A post shared by Mónica Puig (@monicaace93)

And while Puig has chosen not to reveal Mila's face to her audience of 500,000-plus Instagram followers quite yet, she has been giving fans a peek at new motherhood through a series of posts on the platform.

Over the last week, she showcased candid photos from the hospital in the days after Mila's birth, her daughter meeting people close to her for the first time, and walks around town as a family of three. 

Unconditional [love],"" Puig captioned the photos.

“Yup,” 18-time Grand Slam champion Chris Evert wrote in the comments in consensus, while World No. 2 Coco Gauff led a flood of congratulations from Puig's one-time Hologic WTA Tour peers.

Two major finalists of Puig's era, Sabine Lisicki and Lucie Safarova, both moms, welcomed Puig to the ""club"" -- while others including Carla Suárez Navarro, Barbora Strycova, Tracy Austin, Shelby Rogers, Johanna Konta and Alison Riske-Amritraj also offered their well-wishes.

The pop icon said the pontiff was ""the only one of us who cannot be denied entry"" into the territory. 


							By 

	Abid Rahman


International Editor, Digital


Madonna is pleading with Pope Leo to travel to war ravaged Gaza to “bring your light to the children before it's too late.” In a social media message posted on Monday, the pop icon added the pontiff was “the only one of us who cannot be denied entry” into Gaza, adding that “there is no more time” as the territory is suffering what the World Health Organization called man-made “mass starvation.”


	The singer, who was raised Roman Catholic, said the plea was motivated by her son Rocco's birthday. “I feel the best gift I can give to him as a mother — is to ask everyone to do what they can to help save the innocent children caught in the crossfire in Gaza,” Madonna wrote.

	Madonna added, “I am not pointing fingers, placing blame or taking sides. Everyone is suffering. I am merely trying to do what I can to keep these children from dying of starvation.”

	UNICEF, the United Nations' children's agency, tweeted last week that “more than 18,000 children have been killed in Gaza over the last 22 months.” And that “in Gaza, an average of 28 children a day — the size of a classroom — have been killed.”


In a post quote tweeting Madonna on X, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization's president, thanked Madonna for speaking up. “Thank you, @Madonna, for your compassion, solidarity and commitment to care for everyone caught in the #Gaza crisis, especially the children. This is greatly needed. Humanity and peace must prevail,” Ghebreyesus wrote.

	











	Since he became pontiff in May, Pope Leo has continuously called for a ceasefire in Gaza, called for the return of hostages held there and criticized Israel's bombardment of the territory. “I am following with great concern the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the civilian population is suffering from severe hunger and remains exposed to violence and death. I renew my heartfelt appeal for a ceasefire, the release of hostages, and the full respect of humanitarian law,” the pope said in July. 


	Madonna is the latest prominent figure in the world of music to speak out for Palestinians in Gaza. On Sunday, the four members of Irish rock group U2 released individual statements on the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza and the need for action. 


	Madonna's full plea to Pope Leo. 


Most Holy Father.


Please go to Gaza and bring your light to the children before it's too late. As a mother, I cannot bear to watch their suffering. The children of the world belong to everyone. You are the only one of us who cannot be denied entry.


We need the humanitarian gates to be fully opened to save these innocent children.


There is no more time. Please say you will go.


Love,Madonna

She survived a horrific auto accident during the sitcom's second season and went on to become a veterinarian.


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	Danielle Spencer, who played the precocious youngster Dee Thomas on the 1970s ABC sitcom What's Happening!!, has died. She was 60. 


	Spencer died Monday in a hospital in Richmond, Virginia, her What's Happening!! co-star Haywood Nelson told The Hollywood Reporter.




	She was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy in 2014 and in 2018 underwent emergency surgery to relieve bleeding on her brain. A GoFundMe page was set up to help her pay for her medical expenses.

					Ray Brooks, 'Mr Benn' Narrator and 'The Knack ... and How to Get It' Actor, Dies at 86		
			









	“She suffered for a very long time but did it with a great deal of courage,” Nelson said.

	











	Co-produced by All in the Family‘s Bud Yorkin, What's Happening!! was loosely based on the 1975 film Cooley High (Eric Monte wrote the movie screenplay and created the Watts-based sitcom). After a successful four-week run that started in August 1976, the comedy returned in November of that year and then for another two seasons.


	Spencer played Dee, the smart-aleck younger sister of Roger “Raj” Thomas (Ernest Thomas) and daughter of Mabel (Mabel King), and she became known for her catch phrase, “Ooooh, I'm gonna tell Mama!” Nelson portrayed the down-to-earth Dwayne on the show.


	She reprised the role for the sequel What's Happening Now!, which aired for another three seasons starting in 1985.


	Spencer went on to became a veterinarian in 1993, and James L. Brooks hired her to play one in his 1997 film, As Good as It Gets. “She had a great love of animals, she was like Betty White in that way,” Nelson said.


	Born on June 24, 1965, and raised in New York City by her mother, Cheryl, a French teacher, and stepfather, actor Tim Pelt, Danielle Luise Spencer started acting at age 7 in a repertory company co-founded by Pelt.

	











	She had uncredited bit parts in such films as Serpico (1973) and Harry and Tonto (1974) before landing the role in What's Happening!! when she was 11, bringing her and her family to California.


	“I had never seen any young black girl in that type of spotlight, so I didn't have a reference point in the media as to how to deal with this opportunity,” she told Jet magazine in 2014. “I was from the Bronx. What I did was use my own family as the reference on how to portray my character.”


	In September 1977, Spencer was involved in a five-car accident on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu that killed her stepfather, who was driving, and left her in intensive care for several weeks. He had taken her to see Star Wars at the drive-in the previous evening.


	“I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye to my stepfather, Daddy Tim, whom I loved and who taught me show business as a young child in New York,” Spencer wrote in her 2010 memoir, Through the Fire … Journal of a Child Star.


	After What's Happening!! was canceled, Spencer and her family moved to the Ivory Coast. She then attended UC Davis, UCLA and then veterinary school at Tuskegee University, earning a doctorate in veterinary medicine in 1993.


	A decade later, Spencer developed a spinal condition — perhaps caused by her auto accident — that left her paralyzed from the waist down for months.


	Spencer worked as a veterinarian for two decades in the Los Angeles area before relocating in 2014 to Richmond, where she did a regular morning segment about pet care for CBS affiliate WTVR-TV.

	











	In 2014, she was inducted into the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture.


	In addition to her mother, survivors include her brother, Jeremy, a jazz musician.


	In a 2016 interview with Hers magazine, Spencer said it was important to do “what it is that you think is going to make you happy.”


	“You really have to live life for you at that minute,” she said. “And just try to have fun. Be lighthearted and be happy while you're here, because you never know when that time is going to end.”

CEO Max Welch, president Duane Jones, and COO Tim Withers discuss the London- and L.A.-based unscripted producer's 'Making Manson' and other true-crime hits, selling to the likes of Peacock and Fox, and what's next.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Elvis Presley? Check! Charles Manson? Done! Jeffrey Dahmer? Yes! Dr. Phil? Upcoming. Production company Renowned Films, which is operating between London and Los Angeles, has quietly built a transatlantic unscripted business with shows about big names and an unconventional approach focused on fast development cycles, access-led storytelling with an eye on younger audiences, and direct-to-network or streamer sales, along with full rights retention.


	The themes of hustling, disruption, digital production, and serving ideas with a twist to U.S. buyers to cut through in a competitive industry dominated by legacy studios keep coming up during a meeting with Renowned CEO Max Welch, president Duane Jones, and chief operating officer Tim Withers. They have taken time out of their busy schedule to discuss their business approach and such success stories as Making Manson on NBCUniversal streamer Peacock, Loving Elvis on Prime Video, My Son Jeffrey: The Dahmer Family Tapes on Fox, Deadly Waters With Captain Lee on Peacock, and E! Dirty Rotten Scandals: The Dr. Phil Show, which is set to hit E! in 2026.

Obviously, content is king, and I've always had my eye on creating content.” He ended up seeing an opportunity for a magazine show bringing together artists who had made a name for themselves with self-produced music videos.

	











	More than a decade later, he met Welch and Withers. “I felt they are really innovative guys, future-facing,  technical guys who are artistic but do not put art over content,” Jones recalls. “Everything they wanted to make had substance. So, our goals and tastes were aligned in terms of what we wanted to do. We are all very different individually, but I think our purpose was to meet and to create Renowned and make content with a voice.”


	Welch has the brain for business strategy, while Withers understands the ins and outs of production and other technology, as well as financials. “And I tag along and bring in my ideas,” Jones says with a laugh.


	Withers and Welch were still at university when the trio started working together. “We did a whole range of different projects together, and then we got kind of sick of uni. I wasn't really for us. We were actually doing real things,” Welch recalls. “We said we haven't done 10 years at the BBC or 20 years at Banijay. Let's just start a production company and see what we can do. Believing that we had access through Dwayne, we were ambitious and stupid and naive, thinking we could just get into networks. So, we started Renowned in 2012, and then we actually did. We got our first show as Renowned about six months after starting the company.” 


	The show was Winner's Circle on Sky, which provided behind-the-scenes access to top U.K. soccer stars. Branded content series FCUK, which followed Olympic Gold medalist boxer Anthony Joshua, and content for online music platform Vevo, such as interviews with top music stars, also helped the firm make a name for itself.

	











	The formula for Winner's Circle became the firm's calling card: fresh factual entertainment or documentary content focused on stories and names that young audiences care about, produced with the latest technology. “We were making the most of new technology that was coming out, producing something that looked really high-end on next to nothing,” highlights Welch. “I worked on sets with the first RED camera that ever arrived in London, learning about it. So, I was one of the first who actually knew how to set it up and use it. So we took all that knowledge and made our show, which Duane hosted, and we shot, produced, directed, edited, did everything, all just the three of us on next to nothing.”


	Bootstrapping was also the name of the game before the Renowned team got a headquarters. Whether blagging a sofa shop as the location for an interview shoot or meeting people at London's South Bank Center or in the cafes of bookstores, the team did it all to succeed without the need for huge budgets. “At Waterstones as well, they've got cafe areas,” Jones shares. “We would buy books, sit in the cafe area for work meetings, and return the books at the end of the day and get the refund. That was our office space.”


	No traditional industry education, no problem, the Renowned team says. “We just learned how to do things by instinct,” explains Jones. “The landscape of production has changed vastly, and not being traditionally trained means that we kind of created our own business models, acumen, and strategy, so to speak, and it just works. It's all about instinct and understanding audiences.” He adds: “It's all about the DIY generation and real hustle, bypassing gatekeepers on all levels. Let's get it done!”

	











	Early on, industry execs were surprised to meet three young guys in pitch meetings. “We would all sit down with these execs who were expecting a bunch of 50-year-old guys,” Withers recalls. “And they were sort of like, ‘What are you doing?' And we were like: ‘We've got all the biggest music artists in the world and a global brand signed up to make this program. Do you want it on your platform?” And they were like: ‘Yeah!' We've had that kind of hustle mindset that has carried on to this day.”


	Another element of the Renowned model came into play early on. “That first show did really well. We ended up keeping the rights to it and sold it to 60 territories, which helped us get a bit of breathing space to do more development,” Welch tells THR. “So we got our next show, F2 Kicks Off [about a British freestyle soccer duo bringing its feats to international soccer stars, chart-topping musicians and regular people], which was better funded, but still did not have a huge budget. It was maybe one of the first shows that ever used YouTube talent on TV, but did so in a way that it elevated what they were doing to a much bigger audience and also opened up the network to a younger audience. And that was the highest-rated show in that spot on the network. And it proved that we can make a show for Channel 4 that will look really elevated and premium, but the budget will still not be as big as if you're doing a global Netflix show, which we're also doing, and that takes a different style of treatment.”

	











	The early success drew attention – and eventually an investment. In 2015, U.K. broadcaster Channel 4 acquired a minority stake in Renowned. But that DIY and hustle mindset remained. 


	The company's ability to work with different scales and budgets and its team's interest in stories from beyond the pond then allowed Renowned to move beyond a U.K. focus. In 2017, Catfish producer Critical Content acquired a stake in Renowned, while Channel 4 exited its stake. Critical Content CEO Tom Forman joined the company's board.


	The two companies' mindsets matched. “Tom was all about doing the best project possible, but also knocking on every door until you got a yes,” says Welch. “I think that's something that we're quite good at still. We don't really take no for an answer, and we'll keep going until we get a yes on a project.”


	2018 was the year that would prove to become, as the Renowned team calls it, a “pivotal” moment. “We'd done the U.K., we'd worked with a lot of the U.K. networks, but all of the shows we were developing, and all of the access and all the characters, were U.S.-centric,” explains Welch. “So all three of us went out there, met all the networks, met a bunch of production companies out there, and just tried to learn the lay of the land, and what they were looking for. How does it differ from the U.K.?”


	The Renowned team then developed a slate with a focus on what they had learned – and got a first show in the form of Bravo's Million Dollar Rooftops. 

	











	Again, the way of working Renowned brought to the table was different. “We pretty much self-funded the pilot, and walked in with it, and they could just see the product in front of them,” Withers tells THR. “We are saying: ‘Here's the access to the talent, here's a 10-minute tape of everything, here's what, realistically, the schedule looks like, here's a really detailed deck.' It's packaged and all ready to go.”


Copwatch America for BET and other projects followed. And while others were hurt by the COVID pandemic, the Renowned team looked at its lessons and new opportunities. “We just sort of looked at each other and said, ‘Why are we spending so much on real estate?' It's just killing our margins,” Withers says. “So we scaled it back slightly and made things a bit more remote. Post-production can become really expensive and draining for the bottom line.” And the company invested in an Avid Nexis network. “We can work anywhere globally, with anyone in the world.”


	In 2022, Crazy Rich Asians studio SK Global acquired Critical Content and its stake in Renowned, with Forman departing, but the Renowned team was happy with the presence and success it had reached in the U.S. and has continued to push to build it further. 


	And the networked tech set-up allows the firm to work across borders. “For the series Making Manson for Peacock, we had our showrunner based in Costa Rica,” highlights Withers. “We had our editors working in London and New York. It paid off really well. So, for every show we do, we're not geolocked. We can bring the best talent from around the world in for a show to make sure that we're doing it as best we can.”

	











	True crime has become one focus for Renowned. “It speaks to what we've always been good at, which is access and finding what's next or a really exciting way into a subject,” argues Welch. “With Manson, we thought there are always the shows that people rip from the headlines. But if we look at serial killers almost as IP in themselves, Manson is so iconic, and the story hasn't been retold for a while, certainly not for a younger audience.”


	But what approach would make sense? Renowned did a deep dive into research, “spending time getting to know the Manson community, building a lot of trust,” says Welch. “A man who had actually become Manson's closest confidant for the last 20 years of his life, while he was in prison, trusted us. We started to get to know this guy who has this treasure trove of unknown things about this entire story. And we got tapes with 100-plus hours of first-hand material that we packaged up to make it immersive.”


	That's the Renowned approach to all its true crime projects. “We try to find an iconic story or a crazy story, get the access, get the tapes, or something else that allows us to walk in and make a show, to use a phrase that we've come up with, undownturnable.”


	But doing all the legwork for this sort of packaging takes much time and effort. “We're working on projects that we probably won't be pitching until 2026, so our development process is quite long,” Withers explains. “But that's what it takes to get a project that you're going to get instant offers on in the room. We likely have 200-plus ideas, but we're focusing our time on 10 projects that are all killer projects.”

	











Loving Elvis is one such example. Again, it looks at an iconic figures through a contemporary lens, exploring the loves, dalliances, and forbidden courtships of Presley. 


	Having read all this, you may not be surprised to hear that the Renowned office includes a burner phone with a number the team gives out to contributors and “some slightly dodgy characters,” as the team says. And when it rings, there's usually a surprise on the other side. 


	Will the company stay focused on true crime, or what does the future of Renowned look like?


	“We're never going to pigeonhole ourselves in one specific area,” says Withers. “The industry is always evolving, so we're always going to be evolving with it. We just want to be at the forefront of that evolution.”


	Jones echoes that. “Yeah, we will just keep it future-facing, keep producing stuff that hopefully moves the needle. It's a balance between style and the content itself. I hate the term ‘premium.' But it's about worthy content that is also in a style that younger generations want to watch. Just give the young people content that they deserve!”

The rush towards streaming bundles continues, with HBO Max and Asian giant Viu the latest to link up. Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming platform and PCCW-owned Viu on Monday revealed a new streaming bundle offering both companies' services in a single subscription plan.


	The bundle will offer complementary content, with HBO Max's premium Hollywood content such as The Last of Us, The White Lotus, House of the Dragon, A Minecraft Movie, Sinners and Superman available alongside Viu's popular Korean, Chinese and other local Asian content including the hit shows Running Man, 2 Days 1 Night, The Immortal Ascension and Love Has Fireworks. The offer is set to launch in Q4 2025 across Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Notably, the bundle marks the first of its kind across multiple markets in Asia Pacific.

	The new bundle offer will be available for direct purchases via HBO Max and Viu's websites. The companies say that HBO Max and Viu subscribers can access content from each service separately, and content, feature and device compatibility will vary by service. Further details on the bundle will be shared in the coming months.


	The Viu deal is the latest move by Warner Bros. Discovery to increase the reach of HBO Max in Asia Pacific rolling out the service beyond the biggest markets in the regions. In November 2024, HBO Max became available to customers in Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as the five biggest Southeast Asian countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines.


	“Following the proven consumer and business benefits of HBO Max bundles in other parts of the world, this new streaming offering will provide strong entertainment value for consumers across Southeast Asia, and help drive subscriber growth and stronger retention,” said James Gibbons, president of Asia Pacific at Warner Bros. Discovery in a statement. “With access to two complementary and world-class collections in a single subscription, local fans can enjoy even more choice — from premium Hollywood movies and series to standout local Asian content.” 

	











	“Our partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery is an exciting step forward in our promise to continually enhance Viu's entertainment options and meet our viewers' evolving tastes,” said Janice Lee, CEO of Viu and managing director of PCCW Media Group. “By combining HBO Max's Hollywood content with Viu's Asian favorites in a single bundle subscription, we're offering more choice in shows, easier access to diverse content and greater value across a wider range of programming.”

And she has two more chances to win for her Netflix special.

	Paul Grein



Beyoncé is officially a Primetime Emmy winner. The Television Academy announced the winners of the 77th Emmy Awards in juried categories from animation, costume, emerging media programming and motion design on Tuesday (Aug. 12).


	Beyoncé won as a costume designer for her Netflix special Beyoncé Bowl in the category of outstanding costumes for variety, nonfiction or reality programming. She won alongside fellow costume designer Shiona Turini; assistant costume designers Erica Rice and Molly Peters; costume supervisor Chelsea Staebell; and head of workroom Timothy White.

	











	These juried awards will be presented at the 77th Creative Arts Emmy Awards, which will take place at the Peacock Theater at L.A. Live over two nights — Saturday, Sept. 6, and Sunday, Sept. 7. An edited presentation will air Saturday, Sept. 13, at 8 p.m. PT on FXX.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Juried category entrants are screened by a panel of professionals in the appropriate peer groups with the possibility of one, more than one or no entry awarded an Emmy. As a result, there are no nominees, but instead, a one-step evaluation and voting procedure. Deliberations include open discussions of each entrant's work with a thorough review of the merits of awarding the Emmy.


	Beyoncé is also nominated in two other categories for Beyoncé Bowl – outstanding variety special (live) (as performer/executive producer) and outstanding directing for a variety special (in tandem with Alex Rudzinski).

	











	Beyoncé has won 35 Grammys, more than anyone else in history. She received an Oscar nomination for best original song in 2022 for co-writing “Be Alive” from King Richard with DIXSON.

Taylor Swift has officially announced her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl, and may have hinted at key collaborators in the process.

	Notably, longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff seems to be absent from this album cycle, marking a stylistic shift in Swift's creative team.

Kelce told GQ he loves watching girlfriend Swift perform because she can make a stadium feel like ""this little room."" 


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Travis Kelce knows all about sacrificing, training and running your body ragged in order to play like a champ on game day. The 12-year veteran tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs with three Super Bowl rings on his resumé talked to GQ for a new cover story about the laser-focused offseason training regimen aimed at getting the team back to the big game after a tough blow-out loss earlier this year to rivals the Philadelphia Eagles.


	Not for nothing, he also said that as hard as he hits the gym, his girlfriend of two years, Taylor Swift, is just a much of a gym rat when it comes to prep for her shows. 

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“I hadn't experienced somebody in the same shoes as me, having a partner who understands the scrutiny, understands the ups and downs of being in front of millions,” Kelce said in the story that delves into the couple's closely held relationship, which has played out on phone screens on any given Sunday over the past two years as Swift has cheered Kelce on and he returned the favor by attending her epic, three-plus hour Eras Tour gigs around the world.




	“That was very relatable, seeing how exhausted she would get after shows,” he said. “She may not think of herself as an athlete. She will never tell anyone that she is an athlete. But I've seen what she goes through. I've seen the amount of work that she puts on her body, and it's mind-blowing.”


	Swift famously trained for the show by performing the entire career-spanning set while running on a treadmill, something Kelce said was super intense, even for a dedicated athlete like him. He described the stage for the show as “football-field-sized computer,” one that got “scorching hot” on stops in places like Singapore. “All of a sudden you're feeling the fumes from the computer and you're feeling the fumes from the sun and you're doing a show for three hours with a lot of energy, bringing it every single song,” he said of Swift's never-say-quit perseverance. “That is arguably more exhausting than how much I put in on a Sunday, and she's doing it three, four, five days in a row.”


	And while he is a global superstar in his own right now — guest hosting SNL in 2023, appearing in the new Happy Gilmore 2 sequel, hosting his New Heights podcast with brother Jason Kelce and the Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity? series — when it comes to his life in SwiftLand, he's happy to just be a “plus one.”


	Kelce said he is excited to go to Swift's shows and be a fan, because he is a fan. “I'm a fan of music. I'm a fan of art. And it's so cool that I get to experience her being that plus one for me on the football field…. I feel that same enjoyment every time she comes to my shows,” he said of Swift's by-now routine appearances in the family sky box cheering him on during the season. And while he's been introduced to arguably the biggest pop fandom in the world as half of one of the most-watched couples on the planet, Kelce isn't afraid to take credit for making Swift a fan of his world in the process.

	











	“I sort of made her a football fan,” Kelce told the magazine, which described him as speaking freely about his partner with the “confident adoration of a sturdy relationship,” while noting that his pride is not of the macho or overprotective chivalrous type, but more of the “immaculate,” selfless variety. “She is the most engulfed fan now. She knows what the injury reports look like. She understands what special situations are, third and short—all these things because she just naturally loves to hear about my job.”


	He also can't get enough of her shows, marveling at the impact Swift has on her followers and the warm pull of her celebrity, a rare gift that can make a 65,000-capacity football stadium feel like a living room. “People gravitate towards how she performs and how she makes it feel like the entire stadium is in this little room with her,” he said. “She is so good at mesmerizing everybody and making everybody feel like it's an intimate situation. I think that alone — there is so much calm and coolness. She's beautiful. She's up there making everyone feel at ease.”


	As he gears up for the upcoming 2025-2026 football season, Kelce will have plenty more chances to see Swift in the stands, and, maybe, on stage again. The singer surprise announced her 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl, on Tuesday morning (Aug. 12) and while no specifics on the LP have been announced yet, it's possible Swift will reveal some details on Wednesday (Aug. 13) when she makes her first appearance on the New Heights pod.

Senior Managing Editor


Danielle Spencer, who portrayed Raj's sassy younger sister on the 1970s sitcom What's Happening!! died Monday, her former co-star Haywood Nelson revealed on Instagram. She was 60.


	“Dr. Dee, our brilliant, loving, positive, pragmatic warrior, without fail, has finally found her release from the clutches of this world and a body, Nelson wrote. “We celebrate Danielle Spencer and her contributions as we regret to inform her departure and transition from a long battle with cancer.”


	“We have lost a daughter, sister, family member, “What's Happening” cast member, veterinarian animal rights proponent and healer, and cancer heroine,” Nelson continued. “Our Shero. Danielle is loved. She will be missed in this form and forever embraced.”

	











	Spencer was born on June 24, 1965, in Trenton, NJ, to writer Cheryl Pelt. She began her acting career at age 8, and in 1976 was cast as Dee Thomas on ABC's What's Happening!!, which was loosely based on the film Cooley High. She appeared on all three seasons of the show, which ran from 1976 to 1979, and later reprised her role in the series' sequel, What's Happening Now!! 


	Tragedy struck during production on the second season of What's Happening!! in 1977 when she and her stepfather Tim Pelt were involved in a serious car accident that left Pelt dead and Spencer in a coma for three weeks. She spent six months recovering with physical therapy.


	After What's Happening!! was canceled in 1979,  Spencer segued away from acting and attended UC Davis to earn a degree in veterinary science. She later went on to Tuskegee University Veterinary School in Tuskegee, Alabama and became a veterinarian in 1996.

	











	She occasionally made acting appearances after she began work as a veterinarian. She actually portrayed a veterinarian in James L. Brooks film As Good as It Gets and appeared in Peter Rabbit and the Crucifix in 2001. Additional credits include Days Of Our Lives and The Brady Bunch Variety Hour.

I loved her. Best one liners ever. Made you laugh every week. Gone too soon.

She was hysterical on What's Happening, just a natural. Great delivery, great expressions and eye rolls……maybe the best kid actor of that period. RIP, Dee. Even middle class white kids from the suburbs were fans

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","America weaponizes children, and Weapons follows suit","https://www.avclub.com/america-weaponizes-children-weapons-follows-suit-gun-violence","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 19:14:59 GMT","

This article features plot details of Weapons.

Seventeen kids are gone. When Weapons opens, it's already past tense. There is no getting them back, no explaining it, no hiding from the grief and the fear and the sheer weight of the loss. They're simply gone, and no one has answers. It's not accidental that Zach Cregger's latest film arrived in theaters in early August, when parents are buying school supplies and new clothes for growing children who will soon step back into classrooms. Weapons horrifies in many ways, from its dream sequences to its immaculate jump scares, but its most frightening element is that it dares to contemplate the uniquely American horror of an empty classroom.

Cregger's decision to frame the mysterious disappearances that kick off his film as something that's already happened is crucial, because Weapons, for all its marketing's focus on the inciting incident, isn't really about the kids. It's not about kids disappearing so much as it's about the response to kids disappearing—the messy, reckless, and often unforgivable things people do in the wake of such a tragedy. 

The town's response includes everyone from schoolteacher Justine (Julia Garner) to grieving father Archer (Josh Brolin) to spiraling cop Paul (Alden Ehrenreich). Justine, morphed into the town scapegoat because of her proximity to each of the children—as though she secretly coordinated a mass kidnapping and has simply yet to be caught—drowns herself in vodka and pulls the initially reluctant Paul back into an affair. Paul, who's struggling to stay sober and true to his wife Donna (June Diane Raphael), fails on both counts. He expresses his frustrations through police brutality, while his department (led by his father-in-law) seems to have shrugged off the mystery preoccupying the rest of the town. Then there's Archer, who doesn't so much grieve his son as he does disappear into grief; he abandons the bed he shares with his wife for his son's tiny twin mattress and abandons his job in favor of conspiracy, leading the charge of parents blaming Justine for what happened. His work suffers, as does his marriage, but he's determined to grasp at any straw within reach as he plays detective.

This shambling ouroboros of town-wide confusion, anger, and pain is a ritual Americans perform over and over again, each time someone decides to take a gun and open fire in a place where they think they'll do the most damage. It's a metaphor that sounds through Weapons like an ominous mourning bell; to make sure we get it, Cregger even projects a giant assault rifle into the skies of Archer's nightmares. Rifles just like that one hang over all of us, every school, every concert hall, every shopping center, every government building, whether we can see them or not.

But Weapons is not content to coast on the “supernatural mystery as school shooting” metaphor. What makes the film really work is Cregger's decision to leave the kids, for almost the entire film, standing stock-still in a basement, under the influence of an actual witch (a sublime Amy Madigan) who's taken them via blood ritual for her own purposes. With a couple of exceptions, we do not learn the children's names. We do not come to recognize their faces or their hobbies. They are a monolith, a shadow over an entire town, an entire country. 

And what do the adults do in the shadow of this monolithic loss? They turn on each other. They drink, they shout, they have torch-and-pitchfork meetings where they ignore grief counselors and snarl at school administrators. Cregger breaks the melee up into chapters, each focusing on a different link in this ever-growing chain of misery, and the more individuals Weapons follows, the more it becomes clear that this rage and pain isn't about the kids at all. It's about the adults and their excuses, their cruelties, the blows they can land in the blame game.

While the adults are doing this, of course, there is another victim just waiting for someone to pay attention. Alex (Cary Christopher), the lone child from Justine's class who didn't vanish, is not just dealing with survivor's guilt, but living in an entirely different hell, one he doesn't feel safe revealing to anyone. His “Aunt” Gladys (Madigan) has stolen these children in order to drain their vitality, and is now holding Alex and his parents hostage. The other kids may have disappeared, trapped in a trance state, but Alex's entire world shifted overnight into something else. He's left to care for zombies, spooning can after can of soup into lifeless mouths. He's clearly in pain, yet for much of the movie no one (with the exception of Justine) seems to notice or care. He's moving on, they think, as they move him into another class and stop asking questions. Meanwhile, like a kid who survived a mass shooting only to be shoved in front of cameras, used as a political talking point, or—in an increasingly common occurrence—live through another, Alex is trudging through the waste left behind by the neglect of adults.

Many Americans would rather spill more blood, use up the young in service of maintaining some semblance of “the good old days,” and make excuses instead of pursuing the easy solution—that's why assault rifles hover over our nightmares and pristine empty classrooms conjure up images of tragedy rather than potential. Survivors are driven into a corner where they're simultaneously scapegoats and heroes, while those around them argue over the how and the why instead of the what's next. Decisionmakers assign blame and look for motives, turn to buzzwords like “door control,” instead of admitting that this society values the status quo over a roomful of children. The kids in Weapons, the ones actually lost to this mystery, do not get a voice. The adults speak for them, about them, around them. They're not humans, but talking points, just like the kids used as excuses to ban books, to arm teachers, to police bathrooms. The U.S. is all but numb to the idea of losing kids to violence—so used to the arguments and the counterarguments and the wielding of “politicizing tragedy” as a cudgel against progress—that we barely stop to talk about the kids themselves. All of this pulses through Weapons like blood from an open wound.

Cregger does not turn the film into a sermon, but he does lean towards cooperation, as enemies-turned-allies Archer and Justine fight to save these children from a fate worse than death. Thanks to Alex's courage and ingenuity, the kids even get a glorious moment of agency in the end, allowing them to literally rip their captor to shreds, to tear down the old to make way for the new. (They become weapons in a very different sense.) But the film's final words, an observation that “some” of the kids could eventually speak again after their ordeal, leaves Weapons in an honest, haunting, liminal space between endings and solutions. Nothing is really fixed. The film does not end with rescued kids so much as salvaged kids, bodies are strewn across town, and no one will ever be the same; according to the opening voiceover, nobody will even admit what happened. When it comes to tragedies involving children, particularly those that unfold in schools, this is often how the national conversation goes. No ending, no closure, not even the start of some new great debate. Just another untreated wound, left to scar, until the scar tissue builds up so thick and impenetrable that there's no feeling left. The lasting horror of Weapons is the persistence of that numbness. In a film full of recognizable bits of American life, it's what rings the truest.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","With The Squid And The Whale , Noah Baumbach dove deep and made his masterpiece","https://www.avclub.com/the-squid-and-the-whale-saved-noah-baumbach","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 17:01:05 GMT","

“I'm nostalgic for conversations I had yesterday.” 

That line, delivered by a fast-talking and cynical recent college grad (played by Chris Eigeman, who mastered such roles in the '90s) is one of many memorable bits of dialogue in Kicking And Screaming, writer-director Noah Baumbach's first film. (“Is that a pajama top?” is another—it's no wonder its Criterion edition's cover art consists of a bunch of them handdrawn.) But that line also hits on a theme that would end up running throughout Baumbach's now 30-year career: Time is running out. You maybe (probably) missed your chance. The best days have passed. 

It's a sentiment explored throughout the filmmaker's work. Greenberg centers on another cynical guy (Ben Stiller), who passed up on a record deal 15 years back and finds that his life hasn't amounted to much of anything while his peers have moved on. While We're Young is about a stuck documentary filmmaker (Stiller again) who becomes enamored with a Bushwick couple a generation beneath him. In Frances Ha, co-writer Greta Gerwig's aspiring dancer is faced with the harsh and relatable late-twentysomething reality that maybe the dream that brought you to the big city might not come to pass. But, above all, it's certainly the sentiment underlying Baumbach's best film: 2005's The Squid And The Whale. 

“Nostalgic” might be a weird word to describe a semi-autobiographical movie about your parents getting divorced. Baumbach's father and mother, like the ones in this movie, were both writers who split up, and the director grew up in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where Squid was largely filmed. But it is nostalgic, with cinematographer (and frequent collaborator of Wes Anderson,who produced the film) Robert Yeoman giving the neighborhood—parts of which, to be fair, can be awfully photogenic in real life—a warm, retro glow, its leafy streetscapes being the kind you'd love to walk down on a sunny spring day to the sounds of a Bert Jansch song and its central family's brownstone living room lined with books and cloaked in soft, amber lighting. It's a movie that looks back simultaneously fondly and painfully.



The Squid And The Whale was shot on 16-millimeter film to capture those sensations and 1986 Brooklyn (much like how Todd Haynes' Carol would recreate 1950s New York City a decade later). “I wanted to give the film an authentic 1980s feel. I didn't want to use technology that didn't exist at the time,” Baumbach told IndieWire. “Super 16 also feels lived-in, instantly looks like an older film. I wanted to handhold the movie, but steadily, so you detect only a hint of movement. It added to the immediacy of the whole thing.”

It did: The Squid And The Whale is lean and mean—its runtime is a tight, glorious 81 minutes, and emotional scenes that could have played out longer cut quickly to the next ones so as not to lose momentum. It's also very intimate, both in its storytelling scope and its aesthetic, with a filmmaking style that had a “raw feel,” as Baumbach put it to The A.V. Club‘s Noel Murray, that was inspired by “French New Wave movies, and John Cassavetes and early Martin Scorsese.” And the film's verisimilitude—the quick shots of a bodega counter or a subway stop in Flatbush, say, or the very Park Slope-y bathroom radiator and tiling, or the constant search for a parking spot—heightens the sense of place and help you immediately understand it, even if you've never set foot in Brooklyn. “The brownstone we used belonged to my childhood friend Ben and his wife Molly,” Baumbach told IndieWire. “They were really generous to let us transform their place and relocate while we filmed. Shooting in places that had real meaning to me helped me connect with the material on both a visceral and creative level. I also used my parents' real books. And I put Jeff [Daniels] in my dad's clothes.” 

Daniels, who is fantastic in The Squid And The Whale, plays Bernard Berkman, a snobby and formerly notable author (though he's loathe to admit the “formerly” part) who is very much in the mold of Baumbach's go-to fascinations: past-their-prime or self-described, underappreciated-genius characters. Bernard and his wife, Joan —played by Laura Linney, who gives arguably the best performance in the film, flitting between a sweet motherly voice to calling her kid “a shit” to breaking into laughter because her character, whose writing career is on the upswing while Bernard's is stalled, is too exhausted to argue—have decided to separate. 

Their two children, 16-year-old Walt and 12-year-old Frank (Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline, respectively, with the former tackling, presumably, a young Baumbach surrogate), handle the news differently. Walt immediately takes his father's side and villainizes his mother, while the more emotionally open Frank tells all of his friends about the split right away and resorts to drinking alcohol alone and masturbating in school, spreading his cum on lockers and library books. This is very much the kids' film: Early on, the parental strife is seen from their perspective—at a distance, with Walt crouching near the banister to hear the muffled shouting of his parents below.

If some of the Frank stuff sounds particularly left-field or even envelope-pushing for a comedic drama that is, ultimately, an empathetic portrait of a divorce and the people it hurts, it is—and it's not the only instance. These parents talk remarkably candidly, too candidly, about sex with their children, and Bernard in particular gives some very questionable advice. He and Walt even get into an odd sort of love triangle with one of Bernard's writing students, the lively, 20-year-old Lili (a great Anna Paquin) that calls to mind the one at the center of Squid producer Wes Anderson's Rushmore. Before Lili moves in with them—and sleeps with her professor and flirts with his son—Bernard describes her work like this: “She's a very risky writer, Lili. Very racy. I mean, exhibiting her cunt in that fashion is very racy. I mean, Lili hails her influences in postmodern literature, a bit derivative of Kafka. For a student, very racy. Did you get that it was her cunt?” (The fact that you end up caring for Bernard in the end is one of Squid‘s greatest achievements.) 

The Squid And The Whale arrived at a weird and (from an outsider's perspective) make-or-break time for Baumbach, whose career had stumbled in the late '90s. A Filmmaker piece from 2007, when the director was promoting his follow-up to Squid, Margot At The Wedding, tidily summed up that stretch: “After his second film, Mr. Jealousy (1997), Baumbach admits that he got “derailed” and ended up making Highball (1997) pseudonymously then scripted a TV movie, Thirty (2000), neither of which he considers to be his best work. However, his career was re-energized by his association with Wes Anderson: He brought Baumbach on board to co-write The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004), and then produced Baumbach's triumphant The Squid And The Whale (2005).” Murray assessed his pre-Zissou period even more bluntly: “Baumbach fell off the radar.” 

It's hard to imagine the Noah Baumbach we know now—the co-scribe of a billion-dollar phenom, who will release a film starring George Clooney, Adam Sandler, and Laura Dern this November as one of the rare writer-directors who can seemingly make whatever he wants these days—without The Squid And The Whale putting him back on that radar. And while it's foolish to opine on conversations and dealings you weren't privy to, it's also tough not to think that his professional collaboration with Anderson helped bring Squid to life. To this day, Squid is the only film that Anderson has produced that he hasn't also directed and co-written.

But beyond the machinations of finally getting a passion project off the ground, Squid is a notable step up from what Baumbach had done before. Watching it feels akin to seeing a band you like come out with a third record that really surprises you, absolutely rules, and crystallizes the bits you appreciated about them in the first place. Kicking And Screaming is a lot of fun, extremely quotable, and has an amusing, understandable premise. Who doesn't just want to stay at college and ignore the real world for another year after graduating? Mr. Jealousy is also enjoyable as a Woody Allenish, talky comedy starring Kicking vet Eric Stoltz and The Sopranos‘ Annabella Sciorra. But The Squid And The Whale, even though it has a lot of the same ingredients—snobbery, film and book references, smart characters, heartache, a lot of chatting about New York—is a revelation in comparison. It's assured, complete, raw, and instantly worthy of attention, as if Baumbach had this kind of movie in the back of his brain and was finally able to extract it. (“I do think that I in some ways trusted my own voice as a filmmaker more on this one,” he said in that A.V. Club interview.)

One of the running jokes of The Squid And The Whale is that Walt pretends that he penned Pink Floyd's “Hey You.” He ends up winning the talent show for his performance (“I'm going to play lead guitar and do vocals on a song…I wrote,” he says), only to have his trophy taken away when it's discovered that it was actually an incredibly popular track by Pink fucking Floyd. Ken Leung's school therapist presses him on why he lied. “I felt I could have written it, so the fact that it was already written was kind of a technicality,” Walt replies, quickly and defensively. In Squid, you get little glimpses of a smart, impressive teen (though not as smart and impressive as he let on) who would make a film, 19 years later as an adult, that'd finally win those trophies, give him the shot of confidence he needed to reenergize his career, and—most importantly—happen to be really goddamn good (or, to mangle a quote from Bernard, “the fillet of the genre”).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","June Squibb is ""proudly troublesome"" in trailer for Scarlett Johansson's Eleanor The Great","https://www.avclub.com/eleanor-the-great-trailer-scarlett-johansson-june-squibb","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 17:06:14 GMT","

Once again, June Squibb is proving that there's no age limit on being a leading lady. The nonagenarian stars in Scarlett Johansson's feature length directorial debut, Eleanor The Great, as a “witty and proudly troublesome 94-year-old” forced to move from Florida to Manhattan after the death of her best friend, Bessie (Rita Zohar). After a series of misunderstandings, Eleanor ends up telling “a tale that takes on a dangerous life of its own,” per the film's logline. But while Eleanor may be bending the truth, her story ends up leading her into a brand new friendship, this time with a young journalism student named Nina (Erin Kellyman) who's dealing with a loss of her own. As Nina delves deeper into Eleanor's (phony) tale of her life as a Holocaust survivor, she also finds a way to re-connect with her grieving, news anchor father (Chiwetel Ejiofor).



The film looks guaranteed to be a tearjerker; even the trailer might make you a little misty. While Johansson says she's “very proud of it and proud of all the work everybody did to make it,” production was also an emotionally challenging process in a different sense. “Every day the movie fell apart in 400 different ways,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. “It would be easier to make something that was the sequel of a $180 million movie or a genre movie that was subpar. To get much, much, much less money for an independent film with an original story that has a lead actor who was 94 was very, very, very challenging.”

Luckily, Johansson found her way to Sony Pictures Classics, which she said “saved the day” by “still making original ideas and putting faith in first time directors.” The film went on to premiere at Cannes and will also screen at TIFF this fall. Everyone else will get to experience Squibb's latest turn in theaters September 26.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Michael Douglas Posts Rare Photo of His Handsome Son [PIC]","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/michael-douglas-rare-photo-handsome-son/","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 00:43:00 GMT","

Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones both have unparalleled legacies when it comes to their work on the screen. However, they also have two children together, and Douglas recently took to social media to share an image of their son, Dylan, to commemorate his birthday. 

Douglas posted a photo of himself and his son in August 2025. The beloved actor said in the caption, “Wow, a quarter of a century! I couldn't be more proud of your talent and the man you've become. I love you, Dylan. Happy Birthday @dylan__douglas.”

In the photo, the father and son are standing side by side. The “Basic Instinct” actor wore a pair of tan pants and a black polo-style shirt. His son wore a denim outfit for the occasion. 

A post shared by Michael Douglas (@michaelkirkdouglas)

Later, the younger Douglas posted a comment under the picture. He simply said, “Thank you for making me.”

Douglas is following in the footsteps of his famous mother and father. Many followers took to the comment section to also wish him a happy birthday, remark on his talent, and point out the obvious, which is that he looks like his parents. 

One fan commented, “My God! He looks like his mother.” Someone else stated, “Looks like his mom but with the signature Douglas chin!” Another person commented, “Aww, he has the famous Douglas dimple.”

Someone else in the comments suggested a movie role for Douglas. They wrote, “Not sure if he's interested, but he should consider auditioning to be the new James Bond!” Another commenter noted, “He hit the genetic lottery.”

Finally, someone else said, “Happy birthday, Dylan. You look as handsome as your dad.” Douglas turned 25 on August 8. 

Douglas is striving to make a mark on the acting world. He lent his voice for a role in “Phineas & Ferb” in 2011. Notably, he voiced Russell for one episode. However, according to Variety, Douglas has a much bigger movie role on the horizon. 

First reported in March, Douglas will star in a psychological thriller, “I Will Come to You.” Cathedral Collective and Tripwire Entertainment are producing the film. He will play Julian Marks in the upcoming movie. 

He said in a statement, “I was drawn to this role because of its complexity and depth. I am looking forward to bringing this character to life and being a part of a project that pushes boundaries.” Production on the movie is slated to begin in 2025.

The fall movie season, these days, technically begins at Cannes, the new launchpad for Academy Awards contenders and the international arthouse fare that dominates the conversation into the year. That's where “Anora” began its journey en route to the Oscars last year. Same for “The Zone of Interest” and “Anatomy of a Fall” the year before. In other words, the time of year typically reserved for its best movies isn't always its first stop.

Hot off a return-to-form quintessential movie summer thanks to a stacked lineup of blockbusters from “Jurassic World: Rebirth” to “Superman,” this fall will usher in hundreds more releases vying for eyeballs and awards. We've narrowed our list down to 54. Major themes this fall include the rise of beloved auteurs making a comeback (Noah Baumbach with “Jay Kelly,” Paul Thomas Anderson with “One Battle After Another,” Lynne Ramsay with “Die My Love,” Kathryn Bigelow with “A House of Dynamite”), as well as just how much international is here to stay (Cannes Palme d'Or winner “It Was Just an Accident” from Jafar Panahi, Oliver Laxe's Cannes Jury Prize winner “Sirât,” the Oscar hopeful and destined sensation “Sentimental Value”).

While IndieWire's list predominantly focuses on the independents and international releases this fall, there are a few tentpoles we're looking forward to, though neither is an original: Jon M. Chu's “Wicked: For Good” and James Cameron's “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” both of which continue the narratives of their predecessors, albeit in the case of Pandora in a different biome.

Please note that this list is staff-curated and not meant to be exhaustive of every fall title, but just a sampling — there are hundreds of movies coming down the pike, after all! — of ones we're particularly drawn to.

Wilson Chapman, Rance Collins, David Ehrlich, Kate Erbland, Alison Foreman, Jim Hemphill, Marcus Jones, Anne Thompson, and Christian Zilko contributed to this story.

Director Michael Chaves (“The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It,” “The Nun II”) returns to the “Conjuring” universe for the ninth film in the franchise, with “Conjuring” stalwarts Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson back on board as married paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren. Details on the plot have been scarce, and rumors that the film will be some kind of series finale are hard to take seriously — does anyone really believe the Warrens will vanish from movie screens if this is a hit? —JH

Oscar-nominated “Minding the Gap” filmmaker Bing Liu takes his camera from Rockford, Illinois, to New York City with his narrative feature debut, “Preparation for the Next Life.” The Chinese-American doc-maker, who's worked as a camera assistant on fiction series and films, also uncannily follows in the footsteps of “Nickel Boys” director RaMell Ross in parallel fashion: Liu is adapting a novel (here a 2014 book by Atticus Lish), making the transition from docs to narratives, and also for Plan B, Amazon/MGM Studios, and Orion Pictures.

With a screenplay by Martyna Majok, the intimate immigrant romance follows an undocumented Uyghur woman (discovery Sebiye Behtiyar) trying to eke out a life in New York City and escape the hardships she experienced in China. Working in the city's kitchens, Aishe tries to understand the language and reckon with her Muslim family history, having been trained by her military father. She falls in love with Skinner, a PTSD-scarred Iraq war veteran (rising star Fred Hechinger) who has just returned from three tours in the Middle East. The actors share an affecting chemistry against the backdrop of New York's Chinatown, with a haunting, piano-driven score by “The Last Black Man in San Francisco” composer Emile Mosseri and knockout cinematography by Ante Cheng. —RL

Writer/director James Sweeney's second feature rightly won the Audience Award at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, even as headlines of the movie's potentially scandalous sex scenes being leaked threatened to overtake the buzz around “Twinless.” Sweeney stars as droll, conniving, tech-savvy twink Dennis, who befriends another man with a dead twin brother (both played by Dylan O'Brien, in a career-topping performance) to bond over a seemingly similar tragedy.

“Twinless” is rueful, hilarious, and exacting in its exploration of being lonely and gay (or straight, even) in the modern age, with Aisling Franciosi scene-stealing as a co-worker who catches onto Dennis' plans. A mordant delight that deserves the biggest audience possible. —RL

After 15 years, the smash hit U.K. franchise “Downton Abbey” is finally coming to a close — or so it is alleged. This also marks the first, bittersweet, installment since the passing of series matriarch Maggie Smith. Much of the posh crew is back, however, including (among others) Hugh Bonneville, Laura Carmichael, Paul Giamatti, Elizabeth McGovern, and — from the 2022 film “Downton Abbey: A New Era” — Dominic West. Also on board are new faces like Joely Richardson, Alessandro Nivola, Arty Froushan, and Simon Russell Beale. The logline professes that “the time has come to say goodbye to ‘Downton Abbey,' while giving away little in the way of plot details — but here's the teaser. —RC

Among MUBI's impressive Cannes haul is this historical gay romance featuring Paul Mescal and Josh O'Connor as star-crossed lovers. The action starts in 1917 and follows Lionel (Mescal) and David (O'Connor), who bond over their mutual love of folk music at the Boston Conservatory. Years later, they reconnect and go on a journey — musically and romantically — collecting traditional folk songs in New England.

“The History of Sound” earned praise from critics following its Cannes debut, with IndieWire's Ryan Lattanizo writing that the film “is plaintive and lilting as a piano note in minor key, never wallowing in its own misery but still keen to explore the psychic sensations, afterglow, and wreckage of a meaningful connection.” —RC

For over 30 years, directors from George A. Romero to Frank Darabont have tried their hand at getting an adaptation of Stephen King's dystopian novel off the ground but couldn't make it happen; now, over 45 years after the novel's initial publication (under King's pseudonym, Richard Bachman), the movie finally arrives with Francis Lawrence at the helm. The story of a group of young men who enlist in a punishing competition that will leave only one of them alive at the end, “The Long Walk” is both timeless and timely, tapping into current social anxieties without having to force the allegory.

Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson star, and the screenplay is by JT Mollner, who wrote and directed one of the best thrillers of recent years, “Strange Darling.” That film's producer, Roy Lee, is on board as well, and given his track record of superb genre films (he also produced this year's “Companion” and “Weapons”) it seems reasonable to expect something special here. —JH

Forty-one years after their hilarious and influential rockumentary “This Is Spinal Tap,” director Rob Reiner and stars and co-writers Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer return for a look at where the loudest heavy metal band in history is now. Reiner once again plays documentary filmmaker Marty DiBergi, who presumably has picked up a few tricks from the new wave of music documentaries that have proliferated on streaming services in recent years — can Reiner do for the age of Netflix and Apple TV+ celebrity docs what he did for “The Song Remains the Same” and “The Last Waltz” in the first film? Fran Drescher and Paul Shaffer are also returning from the first film, and musicians Paul McCartney, Elton John, Garth Brooks, Questlove, and others are rumored to make appearances as themselves. —JH

Academy Award nominees Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell in a surreal romance from the filmmaker behind “After Yang”? Yes, please. Also known for his earlier Sundance hit “Columbus,” Kogonada returns with “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey.” It was expected this May before moving to September, and the title could apply to any number of love stories. But a buzzy script by Seth Reiss, reportedly sold to Sony for an astronomical amount, and a promising first look from June suggest a flirtatious odyssey that could be truly one of a kind.

“It's funny how the most beautiful places make you feel the most alone,” Farrell laments in the trailer. “Maybe it just depends on the person you're with,” says Robbie.

In real life, an organic interaction between two people that attractive would rip a hole through the ozone layer. Here, their meet-cute is mostly normal, if not a little sad. It's not until the strangers are inexplicably compelled by their cars' navigation systems toward a strange red door in a remote location — where they decide to walk through it, hand in hand — that their unique connection takes shape. Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Lily Rabe, Kevin Kline, and more appear in this time-jumping epic resembling a kind of “Beau Is Afraid” for happy people. —AF

“I Know What You Did Last Summer” star Tyriq Withers stars in another horror film, this one coming from Jordan Peele's Monkeypaw Productions. Withers plays a rising football star who succumbs to the tutelage of a legendary quarterback (Marlon Wayans) whose method of training seems, if the film's trailer is any indication, to be unorthodox at best and deadly at worst. Director Justin Tipping has assembled a promising cast that also includes Julia Fox and Tim Heidecker, returning to the Monkeypaw family after his hilarious performance in Peele's “Us,” and the nightmarish imagery comes courtesy of ace cinematographer Kira Kelly. Monkeypaw's track record is about as consistent as it gets when it comes to delivering grade-A horror, and the early footage indicates they've got another winner with this one. —JH

“Mayor” and “Thank You for Playing” documentary filmmaker David Osit lifts the veil of secrecy and seediness surrounding the since-shuttered Dateline NBC program “To Catch a Predator” in his harrowing Sundance doc, “Predators.” With exclusive access to former host Chris Hansen as well as the subjects (and bait) used to capture possible sexual predators in the show that ran from 2004 to 2007, “Predators” is a gutting exploration of the if-it-bleeds media frenzy.

The documentary features unedited and unaired footage from the humiliation-bent series itself, as well as new interviews with the Reddit-pilled fan community that inspired copycat versions of the quote-unquote reality show. It's a damning look at the show's legacy and how we are all ultimately complicit in the perverted drive toward a communalsense of justice. Hansen, ultimately, is the one humiliated here in this disturbing portrait. —RL

At this point, it's not clear whether Thomas Pynchon is Paul Thomas Anderson's muse or vice versa, as PTA's second Pynchon-inspired movie will be accompanied by the reclusive author's first new novel in over a decade, “Shadow Ticket.” “One Battle After Another” sees Anderson making his second attempt to directly adapt the legendary counterculture author after “Inherent Vice” — though all of Anderson's California-set movies have had a bit of Pynchon-esque flair to them.

This time, he takes on “Vineland,” Pynchon's 1990 novel about aging radicals confronting the failures of the ‘60s counterculture movements in America. While all of Pynchon's novels are filled with his disdain for bureaucracy and colonialism, “Vineland” is his most explicitly political work as it engages directly with the Reagan presidency. Anderson appears to be taking some creative liberties with the source material — from the trailers, we already know that he moved the action to the present day and changed the character names — so it remains to be seen how much of the novel's action makes it into the movie. But Anderson directing Leonardo DiCaprio with the largest budget of his career should be enough to excite any cinephile. —CZ

Madelaine Petsch is back to lead “The Strangers: Chapter 2,” which was filmed simultaneously with 2024's “Chapter 1” and the forthcoming “Chapter 3” — no release date yet on that one. The logline reads in part, “The Strangers are back – more brutal and relentless than ever. When they learn that one of their victims, Maya (Petsch), is still alive, they return to finish what they've started.” The trilogy is related — but separate — from the hit 2008 horror joint “The Strangers,” which starred Liv Tyler and spawned its own 2018 sequel “The Strangers: Prey at Night” with Christinia Hendricks. “Chapter 1” earned nearly $50 million worldwide on an $8.5 million budget. —RC

No stranger to controversy, “Capturing the Friedmans” (2003), “Just a Clown” (2004), “Catfish” (2010), and Emmy-winning series “The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst” (2015) director Andrew Jarecki delivers a harsh exposé of the brutal Alabama state prison system, a six-year investigative documentary made with long-time producer-turned-co-director Charlotte Kaufman. The filmmakers leaned on prisoners throughout Alabama prisons to send them video footage taken on their contraband phones, as well as interviews with the inmates. —AT

Gorgeous and glacial in equally frosty measure, Lucile Hadžihalilović's “The Ice Tower” is all art-film-only vibes, a wintry 1970s fairy tale about a screen actress who casts a potentially dangerous spell. It's anchored by an actress, Marion Cotillard, who has one of the great faces, and a classical sophistication with a glamorous, out-of-reach noirish beauty that pairs wonderfully with a creature cut out of Hans Christian Andersen: amorous, elusive, but wounded.

Shot gorgeously in France and Northern Italy by cinematographer Jonathan Ricquebourg — this is truly the most visually astonishing movie so far to premiere at the 2025 Berlinale — “The Ice Tower” will prove an uneasy catch for commercially minded audiences looking for anything more than a mood in feature form. But those wanting to be hypnotized by cinema, as this film really does put you in a state of trance, will enjoy a unique experience from the director of “Innocence” and “Evolution,” and wife and creative partner of Gaspar Noé, who cameos in this film as a director running a '70s film-set production led by an enigmatic star. —RL

Raoul Peck, a Haitian filmmaker whose work has always had a strong political bent, is best known for his 2016 essay film “I Am Not Your Negro,” which uses the unfinished James Baldwin manuscript “Remember This House” as the skeleton for an examination of the deaths of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, Jr. “Orwell: 2 + 2 = 5” plays like a spiritual successor to his Oscar-nominated breakthrough, mixing Orwell's writings and letters — narrated by Damian Lewis — with archival photographs, footage from various adaptations of seminal dystopian novel “1984,” and modern day news reports to argue how Orwell's fears of a totalitarian state have already come true.

Peck casts a wide net in who he applies to his gaze to, looking broadly at the rise of alt-right movements across the globe, from the USA to Europe to Asia. Unsurprisingly though, a considerable portion of the film centers around Donald Trump and how his cult of personality, his disregard for the truth and obvious lies, and his willingness to subvert democracy all prove eerily similar to the omnipresent, unseen Big Brother of “1984.” —WC

Reviewing “Shelby Oaks” out of Fantasia Fest last year, I gave the ghost movie a “B-” thanks to its bad editing, poor audio, clunky script, and bland final girl, Mia (Camille Sullivan). She's a cookie-cutter genre trope, who I still think is “a moron.” But it's nice she won't stop looking for her sister, Riley (Sarah Durn) — a paranormal investigator who went missing during a bizarre field visit that sparked a frenzy of conspiracies online.

First-time director Chris Stuckmann began his film career as a critic on YouTube. He funded the first “Shelby Oaks,” which screened to only a handful of audiences in 2024, using a viral Kickstarter campaign that broke records among indie films started on the platform. Since then, Neon injected “Shelby Oaks” with an estimated $1 million for “more gore and violence.” Stuckmann finished three days of reshoots in early March, capturing scenes the production couldn't afford until now. —AF

WWE superstar turned blockbuster staple Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson reteams with his “Jungle Cruise” co-star Emily Blunt in Benny Safdie's first solo effort as a director, telling the story of pioneering UFC champion Mark Kerr. Similar to fellow A24 release “The Iron Claw,” the film looks to illuminate the intoxicating highs and painful lows of a mixed martial arts career right as the sport began to gain an international audience at the turn of the millennium. The film, set to have its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, is already eliciting Oscar buzz for Johnson, who is recovering from a string of maligned star vehicles like “Black Adam” and “Red One.” —MJ

Luca Guadagnino has been on a particularly productive tear recently: the “Call Me By Your Name” director's newest film “After the Hunt” is coming to Venice Film Festival one year after “Queer” premiered at the festival, which itself came to theaters five months after his crowd-pleasing tennis drama “Challengers.”

Both of his 2024 films navigated the politics of sexual tension and romance, and “After the Hunt” looks to be a darker take on his favorite themes. Julia Roberts leads the cast as a self-assured Yale philosophy professor, who finds herself torn when her favorite pupil (Ayo Edebiri) accuses her colleague and close friend (Andrew Garfield) of sexual assault. Michael Stuhlbarg and Chloë Sevigny round out the cast of the film, which will also open the New York Film Festival prior to its October theatrical release. —WC

The walls are closing in on Linda (Rose Byrne), a therapist having the worst week of her life, in Mary Bronstein's exhilarating anxiety attack of a feature, “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You.” And the ceiling is dropping out, too.

In writer/director Bronstein's second film (2008's “Yeast”), Byrne gives what will go down as one of the year's great screen performances, channeling Gena Rowlands in anguished close-up as a therapist whose ailing daughter needs around-the-clock care, whose apartment is flooded to ruin, and whose husband (Christian Slater) is nowhere to be found. 

Sundance audiences were wowed and pummeled in equal measure by a film that's earned comparisons to “Uncut Gems” (another A24 title, and with overlap thanks to Josh Safdie as a producer) as Byrne has a wine- and weed-fueled nervous breakdown for two hours. The most mundane frustrations of the day, from harping parking attendees to her hapless patients, become operatic troubles as Australian “Damages” and “Bridesmaids” breakout Byrne gives a career-crowning turn.

Bronstein described the theme of the movie and Linda's driving force as “I need help, I need help, I need help, but please don't help me.” After her apartment floods and a gaping hole opens up in the ceiling, she's forced into a hotel with her daughter, who's hooked up to a machine with a tube in her stomach, a walkie-talkie monitor beeping in Linda's hands at all times as she careens between therapy appointments and rushes to buy more wine from the check-in desk downstairs. More breakdowns and past-trauma-resurfacing ensue in one of the year's very best movies, and backed by a performance that's going down in the all-time annals of screen acting. —RL

Reviews were slightly mixed for “Kiss of the Spider Woman” when it premiered at Sundance this Winter (we gave it a C+), but every critic could agree that the musical's cast — especially breakout star Tonatiuh and Jennifer Lopez as the titular character — was absolutely stellar. Based on the 1992 Broadway musical — itself based on the 1976 Manuel Puig novel, best known for the 1985 movie adaptation starring William Hurt and Raul Julia — the film is set in the ‘70s during the Brazilian military dictatorship, and focuses on the relationship between two prison cellmates.

Valentin (Diego Luna) is a leftist revolutionary, while Luis (Tonatiuh) is a gay man convicted for “corruption of a minor.” To bond, Tonatiuh recounts the plot of a Hollywood musical, which comes to life in fantasy sequences featuring Lopez as the lead. The film, from “Chicago” director Bill Condon, will premiere in October, giving us plenty of time for the much-anticipated Lopez Oscar campaign that will ensue. —WC

Sometimes, a movie sells itself. For example, when you have a true story about a serial robber nicknamed “Roofman” who primarily steals from McDonald's franchises by entering through the roofs before hiding out inside the walls of a Toys ‘R Us once the law is onto him, and he's played by Channing Tatum, and it's directed by indie veteran Derek Cianfrance (director of “Blue Valentine” and “The Place Beyond the Pines”), no further elaboration is required.

The world always needs more great star-driven crime comedies, and Tatum will be flanked by a great ensemble that includes Kirsten Dunst, LaKeith Stanfield, and Peter Dinklage. The film has all the makings of a TIFF crowdpleaser that could end up ranking among Tatum's best roles. —CZ

“Babygirl” star Harris Dickinson is a little too young, a little too handsome, and a little too hot right now for critics to pretend as if his directorial debut exists in a vacuum, and yet the raw and raggedy “Urchin” — which would command our attention regardless of who made it — is only a few seconds old before it's locked into the thrall of a different actor altogether.

Best known for playing the young Tom Riddle in “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,” Frank Dillane awakens into this movie with the ache and neediness of an open wound. His character's name is Mike, he's been living on the streets of London for the last five years, and he resents anyone who offers him the help that he doesn't know how to accept. He mugs a man who tries to feed him, serves another stint in jail, and then tries to live clean on the other side.

But Dickinson's lithe and tetchy script only feigns at a clean hero's journey in order to undercut it with the chaos of human behavior, and what might have been a nice three-act story about a moppet on the mend sours into something far less digestible or instructive. Where a broadly similar film like Mike Leigh's “Naked” tethered itself to the mania of a mad philosopher, “Urchin” is bound to an unbreakable innocence that persists long after Mike has disabused us of our sympathy; he's the victim of a cruel world, but also an unfeeling agent of its callousness. Dickinson clearly hopes this story will make it that much harder for people to dehumanize the homeless population, but the power of his film — and the promise of his intelligence as a filmmaker — is that it recognizes how a portrait of mottled ambivalence might better accomplish that goal than a million cheap sops for empathy. —DE

In his Palme d'Or-winning first project since the Iranian regime ostensibly lifted its restrictions on his art, filmmaker Jafar Panahi draws from his different experiences as a dissident prisoner for a raw and blistering moral thriller about a hard-working Azeri man whose most tormented memories come rushing to the surface when he hears someone walk into his place of business with the same haunting squeak of his former torturer's prosthetic right leg.

Played by Vahid Mobasser, a TV station programmer and part-time cab driver, Vahid impulsively abducts the man (Ebrahim Azizi, the only professional actor in this extraordinary cast), drags him into the middle of the desert, and digs a hole big enough to bury his pain alive. Alas, doubt begins to seep in through the cracks.

So begins a gripping and tightly scripted misadventure that unfolds like something of a cross between Park Chan-wook's “Lady Vengeance” and Panahi's own “Taxi” (with a little “Waiting for Godot” thrown in for good measure), as Vahid's one-man truth and reconciliation commission grows to include a handful of other people whose skin carries the scars of “Peg Leg's” violence. From the plot description alone, it's obvious that “It Was Just an Accident” finds Panahi working in a very different register than he had to while “banned” from making films. This one still had to be shot in secret in order to skirt government approval, but it takes great pleasure in replacing the self-reflexivity of Panahi's illegal work with a slightly more formal sense of composition, even if it remains impossible to separate the final product from the personal experience that informed it. —DE

“The Black Phone” was a massive hit for Blumhouse in 2021, earning more than $162 million on an estimated $16 million budget. After the studio seriously misjudged what audiences wanted from “M3GAN 2.0,” Blumhouse mainly needs Scott Derrickson's upcoming sequel with Ethan Hawke to be smart.

That's a tall order considering the ending from the original “Black Phone” made the follow-up project something of a head-scratcher in the first place. But the trailer is promising and Hawke's new spin on The Grabber — contorted from a human kidnapper to resemble a “Nightmare on Elm Street”-like monster here — feels tempting.

The first film adapts Joe Hill's short of the same name. In “The Black Phone 2,” Derrickson and returning co-writer C. Robert Cargill expand that universe with a story reminiscent of “Doctor Sleep” by Stephen King (Hill's father).

“Dead is just a word, you should know that better than most,” The Grabber says in a trailer that also sees him… wait for it… ON ICE SKATES!

Once again, he's once taunting Finney (Mason Thames, who grew up overnight) — but now, he's the one haunting the phone. Out for revenge, Madeleine McGraw and Jeremy Davies return to a cast also adding Academy Award nominee Demián Bichir (2011's “A Better Life”), “Final Destination: Bloodlines” star Anna Lore, and more. —AF

Aziz Ansari's “Good Fortune” is almost more notable for the hurdles the comic endured on the way to directing his debut feature than its substance itself. But with a Toronto premiere and October release date on the horizon, the film will finally get a chance to speak for itself. Ansari stars as a struggling gig worker who resents his rich boss (Seth Rogen), only to find his perspective shift when a low-level guardian angel (Keanu Reeves) intervenes in both mens' lives. The film appears to be positioning itself as a modern day “It's a Wonderful Life” with particular attention paid to current economic inequality — an ambitious swing, but one that could establish Ansari as a rising filmmaking star if it lands. —CZ

Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke are up there with Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, even Alfred Hitchcock and James Stewart, as one of cinema's iconic perennial pairings. From the “Before” films and “Waking Life” to “Boyhood” (which earned Hawke an Oscar nomination) and even the underseen motel-room-only DV thriller “Tape,” they're operating on an alchemy rare for onscreen director-actor collaborators.

Their latest project together is “Blue Moon,” which may distract at first for the bald cap Hawke wears to play desperate, boozing songwriter Lorenz Hart. But underneath that feat of movie makeup magic is one of Hawke's most wistful, poignant performances, here as the great American lyricist who was one half of Rodgers and Hart before a creative split.

“Blue Moon” is set over the course of one night, in the iconic New York bar Sardi's, at the after-party for the 1943 premiere of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein's stage musical “Oklahoma!” Hart's personal and professional lives dovetail and unravel as jealousy seethes over his former creative partner's success, his own sexuality gets a bit wobbly, and he bonds with a bright-spirited protégé (Margaret Qualley, who plays her character like a sad starlet of the Jazz Age). The cast includes Andrew Scott as Richard Rodgers, Simon Delaney as Oscar Hammerstein, Cillian Sullivan as Stephen Sondheim, and Bobby Cannavale as the charming barkeep trying not to serve Lorenz too much, or at all. —RL

When the jazzy, jittery opening of Kelly Reichardt's “The Mastermind” begins with slow, vertically crawling title cards in Bauhaus-like font, you know you're about to be thrown back in cinematic time.

Shot on film with the grainy warmth that evokes a sleepy 1970 New England municipality as much as it does actual movies from the ‘70s, “The Mastermind” is Reichardt's version of a heist movie — meaning that the filmmaker hijacks conventions laid by filmmakers like Jean-Pierre Melville and Sidney Lumet for a spin that still retains her patient bent for long, luxuriating takes. Here, Josh O'Connor plays J.B. Mooney (what a name!), an art thief who falls down a hole of his own digging, as a poorly hatched job to rip off a series of Arthur Dove abstract paintings from a fictional Massachusetts museum sends his private and family lives careening out of his grasp.

“The Mastermind” is more an aftermath-of-a-heist movie than one about the job's high-stakes particulars, though Reichardt captures them with breath-bating suspense in the film's first act. Reichardt, writing her own script, is more invested in the what-happens-after, the slow-drip comedown of J.B.'s catastrophic hubris in thinking he could carry out a grab-and-run robbery in such a small town. —RL

“Candyman” director Nia DaCosta has already done the hard work of establishing herself as a major filmmaker to watch, but she's about to reintroduce herself all the same. Not only will next January will see the release of her much-anticipated sequel to this summer's “28 Years Later,” but DaCosta is also set to debut a smaller and more personal project that will showcase her range as an artist: A race-swapped re-imagination of Henrik Ibsen's “Hedda Gabler,” starring Tessa Thompson as the bored and dissatisfied wife of a lovestruck academic who doesn't see her for the woman she really is (he's played here by Tom Bateman), and Nina Hoss as an old friend whose relationship with them both is about to get a lot more interesting.

Set to premiere at TIFF in September, and already riding a quiet wave of good buzz for its smart and daring approach to such vaunted source material, DaCosta's “Hedda” is poised to begin the next phase of DaCosta's career entirely on her own terms. —DE

Elizabeth Lo, the Hong Kong filmmaker behind the lauded 2020 documentary “Stray” that followed street dogs looking for companionship in Istanbul, returns with the gripping and fascinatingly conceived nonfiction portrait “Mistress Dispeller.” This look at a love triangle from all sides focuses on a novel profession that is perhaps only offered in China, where the movie plays out: The titular dispeller is a woman hired to break up extramarital affairs, getting to the root of the infidelity by befriending husband, wife, and mistress, only to remind said husband and wife why they got together in the first place. And should stay together. And perhaps how the husband's transgression can bring them closer to a newfound peace. —RL

There's something a little sacrilegious about making a movie about Bruce Springsteen recording his classic, mournful album “Nebraska” and ending the trailer with a big, shiny “Born to Run” needle drop. That said, there's still cause for hope that the clunkily titled “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere” can be more than just another bog-standard biopic in the “A Complete Unknown” vein.

Director Scott Cooper has assembled a solid cast, led by Jeremy Allen White in his first real attempt to make the transition from Emmy-winning “The Bear” lead to full-fledged movie star by playing the Boss himself. Jeremy Strong, Paul Walter Hauser, Stephen Graham, Odessa Young, Gaby Hoffmann, Marc Maron, and David Krumholtz makes for an appealing ensemble, and the film's focus on Springsteen making just one album promises the rare music movie to actually explore the artistic process behind the music with real depth. Even in the worst-case scenario? Your dad will love this. —WC

Yorgos Lanthimos reunites some of his favorite collaborators for this English-language remake of the Korean film “Save the Green Planet!” — and on paper, there's no reason to believe it won't be a continuation of his recent hot streak. Jesse Plemons stars as a beekeeper who kidnaps a powerful pharmaceutical CEO (who else, Emma Stone) as part of an environmentalist initiative that goes awry. The film, which also deals with aliens, could be the Greek director's hardest foray into sci-fi to date, but his triumphs in adjacent genres is reason enough to believe he can pull it off. —CZ

Kathryn Bigelow has been pretty quiet since the release of her not-so-well-received “Detroit” in 2017, but she's about to come back in a big way with a major Netflix movie that has already earned itself a spot in Venice's competition lineup. The “Zero Dark Thirty” director is no stranger to high-octane Washington thrillers, and the Noah Oppenheim-scripted “A House of Dynamite” — about a group of White House officials who scramble to defend against an imminent missile attack against the United States — seems likely to play right into her strengths, just as it feels certain to continue her streak of delivering muscular but politically incendiary entertainment.

Not only is this poised to be Bigelow's most stressful film to date, it also promises to be her most star-studded, as the cast includes (deep breath) Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Jared Harris, Tracy Letts, Moses Ingram, Greta Lee, Kaitlyn Dever, Renée Elise Goldsberry, and more. So many more. Here's hoping that some of them are still alive by the time it's all over. —DE

If the best way to criticize a movie, as Cahiers du Cinéma critic Godard once said, is to make one, then director Richard Linklater's answer to making a tribute to “Breathless” might instead be to not quite criticize but certainly to subvert the tropes of movies about moviemaking. His black-and-white “Nouvelle Vague,” itself a meticulous recreation of a movie made in 1959 with all the celluloid, Academy-ratio crackle and pop, is more New Wave hangout movie than cinema history, with the parade of faces and names inspiring knowing and satisfied laughs in the cinephile audience. —RL

Neon follows its animation winning streak with 2021's docu-memoir turned three-time Oscar nominee “Flee” with France's “Arco,” which like this year's Best Animated Feature winner from Latvia, “Flow,” emerged from the Cannes Film Festival. Natalie Portman produces writer/director Ugo Bienvenu's animated adventure, which begins in the year 2932 with a 10-year-old who uses a rainbow to time-travel to the year 2075. In this distant future, humanity now resides on cloud platforms a la the Jetsons. During his time travel journey, Arco meets Iris, who must help bring him back to his utopian future world. —RL

Three-time Oscar winner Guillermo del Toro readies what is already being teased as the horror auteur's magnum opus. Judging by what has already been shown of del Toro's take on Mary Shelley's enduring literary masterpiece, the Netflix film expands far outside the walls of Dr. Victor Frankenstein's twisted laboratory to snowy locales, and vast Regency era halls. While Oscar Isaac stars as the scientist playing God, the new take on his monster is played by Jacob Elordi, with scream queen Mia Goth and two-time Oscar winner Christoph Waltz in supporting roles as well. —MJ

You haven't lived until you've seen Jennifer Lawrence doing any of the debasing things she does in Lynne Ramsay's “Die My Love,” like crawling on all fours through a field of grass, a kitchen knife in hand as she closes in on her character Grace's newborn baby, or masturbating gloomily in a state of postpartum doom while her husband Jackson (Robert Pattinson) finishes cooking dinner downstairs, a self-induced orgasm timed to the spring of a toaster below.

Grace is just trying to be a good wife, a good mother, but she's failing spectacularly at it in Ramsay's alternately absorbing, exhausting tone poem of post-birth grief turned into psychosexual frenzy. Lawrence — whose fearless skill in conjuring women gone perilously over the verge and unhinged from top to toe while trying to play house was already established in Darren Aronofsky's “mother!” — gives the kind of unleashed performance film festival Best Actress prizes are made for in the “We Need to Talk About Kevin” filmmaker's latest.

Co-written with Enda Walsh and Alice Birch from a novel by Ariana Harwicz, “Die My Love” is a two-hour cinematic miasma of what it's like to be in postpartum depression hell and possessed by a sexual appetite that could never possibly be quenched by even someone as hot as Robert Pattinson. As such, it will be a tough sell for even Lawrence's most ardent fans. The story offers little to hook us onto other than Grace's constant flailing through psychosis, visually realized by cinematographer Seamus McGarvey with the feeling of a bad dream you wake up from in a heated, unforgiving sweat. The atmosphere of this fugue-state-turned-panic-attack of a film is never not intoxicating. As Grace spins out in a hothouse countryside beset by ever-buzzing flies — inescapable swelter and tall grass abound — you can all but feel the ticks and Lyme disease consuming you. —RL

Ben Whishaw again proves himself as the brilliant actor we all knew he was, if we were looking closely enough, in Ira Sachs‘ “Peter Hujar's Day.” The film, set in 1974 New York City, is an intimate two-hander starring just Whishaw and Rebecca Hall as gay photographer Peter Hujar and writer Linda Rosenkrantz, respectively. They gathered, it's true, on a cold day in December, where Hujar recounts all the events of the previous one, which involved photo opportunities with Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs, and a lot of quotidian nothingness. But those small moments of a day grow profound as Peter's winding monologue wears on.

Writer/director Sachs' extraordinary new movie never breaks from the pair, and at times becomes like a documentary about the greatness of the actors themselves, Mozart possessing the soundtrack as Sachs and cinematographer Alex Ashe take longing, lingering B-roll of the performers. —RL

Fingers crossed Dan Trachtenberg sticks the landing on his “Predator”/“Prey” hat trick for Hulu. After bringing back the ‘80s action franchise with a prequel starring Amber Midthunder in 2022, Trachtenberg delivered “Predator: Killer of Killers” in June. Co-directed with Joshua Wassung, the anthology jumps through time to pit the Predator against a menagerie of universe-expanding monsters.

In a favorable review for IndieWire, David Ehrlich compared the film to the kind of hypothetical questions you'll typically find batted around by stoners in basements. It's a compliment that reflects an expansive sci-fi universe slowly inching toward the scope and depth of the “Alien” franchise.

That's overstating things a bit, but “Killer of Killers” comes to resemble an iconic idea ripped from the “Twilight Zone” (see Season 1, Episode 25 on Paramount) that could pay off when Trachtenberg returns this fall, with his second “Predator” of 2025. Set in the future on another planet, “Predator: Badlands” stars Elle Fanning as an android opposite New Zealand actor Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi as a young Predator named Dek. —AF

There's already been a film based on Stephen King's “The Running Man” starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, but don't you dare call Edgar Wright's new one a remake. While Paul Michael Glaser's 1987 film made liberal changes to King's pseudsonymly published novel, Wright has promised audiences that his film will be the first faithful adaption of the book, which follows a man who signs up for a dystopian gameshow in which the entire world tries to kill him for a month on national TV.

Trailers appear to confirm that the material is a perfect fit for Wright's whimsical action sensibilities, with the footage resembling a live action video game as Man of the Moment Glen Powell tries to dodge endless attackers in a world split between monochromatic grey poverty and colorful opulence. The film could be a return to form for Wright after the disappointing “Last Night in Soho,” and the combination of spectacle and movie stardom at his disposal could make it his biggest box office hit to date. —CZ

In Max Walker-Silverman's “Rebuilding,” Josh O'Connor plays a Colorado rancher who has to adapt to life after a devastating wildfire destroys his home. It's a film that feels deeply relevant for reasons that require no explanation, but the genesis of the idea came from a tragic experience in Walker-Silverman's own life that saw the community of his Colorado hometown rally around his family.

The “A Love Song” director's sophomore feature is plaintive and lovely, shot on location in San Luis Valley, where Dusty (a superb O'Connor, channeling New Hollywood Westerns like “Hud” and “The Last Picture Show”) must relocate to temporary FEMA housing, reconnecting with his ex-wife Ruby (Meghann Fahy, star of “White Lotus,” who gives a compelling dramatic performance) and young daughter (the promising Lily LaTorre) in the process. Meanwhile, dreams of moving to Montana linger in Dusty's mind as he must make some tough decisions. Amy Madigan and Kali Reis also bring texture to this sparse, touching movie that premiered at Sundance. —RL

At this point, there's no easier movie to recommend this fall than Joachim Trier's Cannes stunner “Sentimental Value,” which was the most thoroughly satisfying film we saw on the Croisette this year, and leapt to near the top of our list of the decade's best films within a few short weeks of its premiere.

A career-defining Stellan Skarsgård stars as acclaimed filmmaker and absent father Gustav Borg, who hopes to atone for his decades away from his family by casting his estranged daughter Nora (Renate Reinsve) in an autobiographical Netflix drama about his own life. Exploitative as that sounds, Gustav isn't just hoping to make Nora say the words he's always longed to hear from his firstborn daughter in exchange for a cut of Ted Sarandos' money. On the contrary, his plan — like everything else in the transcendently moving “Sentimental Value,” the masterpiece that “The Worst Person in the World” director Joachim Trier has been working toward for his entire career — is layered with a delicate sense of personal history. Because the (once) great auteur Borg doesn't intend for Nora to play a version of herself in his movie. No, he insists on using her as a stand-in for his mother, who committed suicide in the sun-bathed Oslo house that has belonged to their family since at least the start of World War II.

From that premise, Trier spins the richest and most emotionally overflowing film that he's made so far — one that comes to involve a bit of “Vertigo” when Nora rejects her father's offer, only to watch him cast an American starlet (Elle Fanning) to play the role Gustav had written for her. Few recent movies have more elegantly literalized how the love that parents are able to share with their children — and vice versa — can be limited by their ability to express it. And by the time that “Sentimental Value” arrives at its soul-melting final sequence, almost none have more beautifully explored the role that making art can play in facilitating that process. —DE

With the U.S. actively battling comparisons to Nazi Germany, World War II movies are going to feel weird. For a while. That won't stop the guy who wrote “Zodiac” from adapting “The Nazi and the Psychiatrist” — a 2013 nonfiction book by Jack El-Hai about the Nuremberg trials — this fall. James Vanderbilt had a hand in shaping “The Amazing Spider-Man,” “Ready or Not,” “Scream VI,” and more as a writer and producer, but his directorial debut “Truth” was met with mixed reviews. The historical drama from 2015 may still prove an important first attempt for the filmmaker, who now tackles the question, “What makes us evil?” at a critical time.

“Nuremberg” stars Rami Malek as Douglas Kelley: an American military psychiatrist sent to study Nazis as they await trial in Luxembourg. Tasked with making sure the accused are fit for questioning, Kelley encounters an array of characters but becomes transfixed with the magnetic Hermann Göring, the right-hand man to Hitler. Russell Crowe plays the part in a cast that also includes Michael Shannon, Richard E. Grant, John Slattery, and more. —AF

Ryan White's latest documentary, “Come See Me in the Good Light,” was already a tremendously impactful offering in January, when the long-time documentarian's most recent intimate exploration of a truly interesting (and, this is also key, genuinely inspirational) person played to packed houses and picked up the fest's Festival Favorite award from engaged audiences. A few months on, however, the film has taken on even more resonance and emotion, as subject Andrea Gibson passed away in July. White's film about the lauded slam poet always hinged on the possibility that Gibson would not be around to celebrate it — White himself told IndieWire in January that everyone expected the film would end with Gibson's death from cancer — but Gibson and their wife and many other friends were able to fete the film in Park City, adding a poignant touch to a doc that would be satisfying and heartbreaking no matter where, when, or how it ended. —KE

Noah Baumbach has spent the six years since “Marriage Story” doing things you'd never expect him to do, like picking up an Oscar nomination for co-writing “Barbie” with Greta Gerwig and directing an uneven-but-ambitious of Don DeLillo's apocalyptic novel “White Noise.” But with his latest film, he appears to be returning to his bread-and-butter: small, mature adult dramedies. And when you have a track record like his, returning to your roots is never a bad thing.

“Jay Kelly” stars George Clooney as an eponymous movie star traveling through Europe with his manager (Adam Sandler, whom Baumbach has directed to dramatic success in “The Meyerowitz Stories”). With a cast that also includes Gerwig, Laura Dern, and Riley Keough, “Jay Kelly” could be Netflix's best horse in the awards race. —CZ

Alive and brimming where most neorealist festival movies prefer the detached slow crawl that strains toward a vision of real life, Shih-Ching Tsou's solo directing debut “Left-Handed Girl” is born from a collaboration with a longtime friend, and a filmmaker familiar to most people reading this.

Sean Baker co-writes (with Tsou), produces, and edits the Taiwanese filmmaker's Cannes Critics' Week premiere after Tsou, for decades, produced Baker outings like “Tangerine,” “Red Rocket,” and “The Florida Project.” A kaleidoscopic, if eventually melodramatic, portrait of a Taiwanese family returning to Taipei to set up a night market noodle shop, “Left-Handed Girl” isn't Tsou's first at-bat as director: She co-helmed Baker's 2004 indie name-maker “Take Out,” about a Chinese food delivery worker hustling in New York City.

Tsou applies the restless energy of her longtime collaborator's beloved social-realist works — portraits of men and women working against their class station to find a better living — to “Left-Handed Girl,” which rests on the skillfully directed performance of a five-year-old girl (Nina Ye, a small child who effervescently commands the camera) in the lead. The movie, even when tracking the older daughter I-Ann (Shih-Yuan Ma) and mother Shu-Fen (Janel Tasi) who make up this heartwarming family trio, is always inside the tiny girls' eyes and ears, looking at the world from a place of wonderment and confusion as she tries to make sense of an adult world. —RL

French-Spanish filmmaker Oliver Laxe (“Fire Will Come”) channels William Friedkin's “Sorcerer” and Henri-Georges Clouzot's “The Wages of Fear” for this brutal, unsparing story of a father (a movingly desperate Sergi López) and son wandering through EDM raves in the Moroccan desert looking for a missing woman (his daughter and the son's sister). They link up with a group of drugged-out ravers, dancing to the beat against the end of the world, as armed conflict supposedly rages not far from the North African desert. You think this is one movie, and then it becomes another one entirely, often daring you to look away as Laxe's vision, inescapably fatalistic but impossible to ignore, hurtles toward doom, spiked with psychoactive drugs that seem to take hold of the film itself. —RL

A black and cursed cloud, a vector of misfortune, follows Idaho day laborer Robert Grainier in director Clint Bentley's elegantly crafted and ruminating Denis Johnson adaptation, “Train Dreams.” Beginning with a POV shot of a cut tree dropping dead to the ground, the camera fixed to where the fir was felled, this 20th-century portrait of the Pacific Northwest weaves much pain and suffering in the life of Grainier, played with a hardened soul by a bearded Joel Edgerton.

Robert goes from day laborer to Spokane railroad logger, perennially tested by a nature that seems to have more control over human destiny than people themselves do. Co-written by Bentley with Greg Kwedar (the primary creative team behind “Sing Sing”), “Train Dreams” thrives on its philosophical inquiries into the earthly randomness of events that make up a life. The effect — amplified by skillful craftsmanship and a fondness for detail in even the most out-of-focus corners of a shot — leaves you winded. —RL

If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times: Hollywood cannot afford to release epic metaphors about the rise of fascism in parts! That said, credit to director Jon M. Chu for turning around “Wicked: For Good” fast enough that many of the movie's fans seem genuinely surprised its sequel is nearly ready to come out.

Filmed back-to-back, the two “Wicked” films have walked through the production and release pipeline hand in hand, (pinky finger to pinky finger?) — with Part One going through last year's awards circuit while “For Good” was in post-production.

“Wicked” tied with “The Brutalist” for most nominations at the Oscars last year, winning two of ten categories, including Best Costume Design and Best Production Design. That experience will no doubt shape how Act II is edited and marketed. Will it be for the better?

Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande delivered their Elphaba and Glinda all at once, so it won't impact them, but we can expect another great press tour. And Chu seems confident enough to not to be shaken be criticism, good or bad. With key reprises on the horizon, let's hope “For Good” can hold enough space [wink] for the finale moment its gravity-defying predecessor set up in 2024. —AF

Wagner Moura won Best Actor at Cannes for Kleber Mendonça Filho's dazzling and often dizzyingly constructed tapestry of Brazil in the 1970s, “The Secret Agent.” In this genre-spanning twist on everything from the espionage thriller to the father-son melodrama (Moura's character is trying to reunite with his), Marcelo is a technology expert on the run circa the Carnival celebration in Recife. Meanwhile, the last years of military dictatorship hang over Brazil as the government weeds out dissidents such as him.

Mendonça's deeply personal film resurrects childhood memories of his home country — as well as a good-natured love of cartoon violence. Watch out for a disembodied leg that goes on a rampage, literalizing an urban myth that haunts the movie. But it's Moura's poignant performance that lingers from the frames. —RL

After making three small indie films set in the American West and a Marvel movie that proved an ill use for her talents, Chloé Zhao is venturing into a new frontier: Elizabethan England. The director's newest film “Hamnet,” based on the acclaimed novel by Maggie O'Farrell, focuses on the creation of William Shakespeare's classic “Hamlet” through the perspective of his wife — named Agnes in the film — grappling with the death of their son Hamnet.

How Zhao's style will translate to this period piece setting is a fascinating question, and she's found two massively appealing actors — Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal — to lead it. With a likely Telluride premiere this fall before a November release date, “Hamnet” looks like it could be a major Oscar contender this awards season. —WC

Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is back for his third theatrical assignment, with writer/director Rein Johnson delivering another “Knives Out” sequel, following the original 2019 film and its 2022 follow-up, “Glass Onion.” The scope of its theatrical release is uncertain — after the first film was a sleeper box office hit, the second only received a limited, awards-qualifying one-week run before launching on Netflix. The cast, similar to the other installments, has a new slate of all-stars, including Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, Kerry Washington, Mila Kunis, Jeremy Renner, Andrew Scott, Cailee Spaeny, Thomas Haden Church, and Daryl McCormack. —RC

Love it or hate it, “Avatar” is undeniable. James Cameron's latest journey into his sci-fi world of Pandora has been subject to repeated delays since it was shot back-to-back with “The Way of Water,” but it's officially heading to theaters this December. The next entry in Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri's (Zoe Saldaña) quest to find safety for their family focuses on the family as they become caught in a war between two Na'vi tribes: the Wind Traders and Fire People. Tons of cast members from the past two films (Sigourney Weaver, Kate Winslet, Stephen Lang, and CCH Pounder among them) are back, while David Thewlis and Oona Chaplin join the saga. Two things can be certain: the film will look absolutely incredible in 3D, and it will gross an obscene amount of money. —WC

Fresh off his second Best Actor nomination, and two straight years of leading unconventional end-of-the-year box office successes, star Timothée Chalamet will end 2025 alongside director Josh Safdie, telling their spin on the story of real-life professional table tennis player Marty Reisman.

In addition to the promise of several creative liberties being taken, the Christmas Day A24 release offers the onscreen return of Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow, who took a break from movies post “Avengers: Endgame.” As either Safdie brother is wont to do, the cast is rounded out by an eclectic group of individuals not often seen on film, from rapper Tyler, the Creator to magician Penn Jillette, and “Shark Tank” star Kevin O'Leary. —MJ

Hannah Frances has announced a new album: Nested in Tangles arrives October 10 via Fire Talk. Frances recorded her follow-up to 2024's Keeper of the Shepherd alongside producer Kevin Copeland, and she also enlisted Grizzly Bear's Daniel Rossen for two songs. Watch her self-directed music video for new single “Surviving You” below.

“‘Surviving You' is a reflection on the ways generational trauma can repeat itself when unexamined, and the ways we learn to protect ourselves through necessity,” Frances said in a press statement. “This is for anyone who grew up in a turbulent and harmful home and is learning to affirm their lived experience.”

Last month, Frances shared the song “Falling From and Further,” which also appears on Nested in Tangles. She has a bunch of shows coming up, including a number headlining dates that take place in the autumn. See Frances' full schedule below.

	Daryl Hall and John Oates have privately resolved the legal dispute involving the very public breakdown in their business partnership, court filings confirm.


	“The claims have been adjudicated in arbitration. Given the entry of final judgment in arbitration, plaintiffs will be contemporaneously filing a notice of voluntary dismissal with the court,” lawyers for Hall wrote in a status report filed Monday in Nashville court and obtained by Rolling Stone. The filing did not say when the arbitration outcome was finalized or reveal any details. 


	The status update was the first filing by either party since one of the most successful pop duos of all time burst into the headlines in 2023 with their acrimonious split. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame artists known for their massive Eighties hits “Maneater,” “Private Eyes,” “Kiss on My List,” and “I Can't Go for That (No Can Do),” were no longer on speaking terms as they fought over Oates' right to sell his half of their business partnerhip to Primary Wave, court filings revealed.

	











	In a November 2023 declaration to the court, Hall accused Oates of committing the “ultimate partnership betrayal.” He claimed Oates went behind his back, negotiated with Primary Wave in secret, and then “ambushed” him with news he intended to sell his half of their Whole Oats Enterprises partnership, known as WOE, to the music publishing company as Hall was preparing to leave on a tour. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In his declaration, Hall said he didn't “agree” with Primary Wave's business model and believed such a sale could cause “unimaginable” harm to WOE's assets, which include the music duo's trademarks, personal name and likeness rights, record royalty income, and social media and website properties.

	











	“Over the course of the last several years, there has been a significant shift in John Oates' behavior away from operating in a professional and business-minded manner, particularly as it relates to WOE. His behavior has become adversarial and aggressive instead of professional and courteous,” Hall wrote. “It appears to me that John Oates' intent has become to burden and harass me without regard to my interests as his business partner, or the interests of WOE.”

	Lawyers for Hall and Oates did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.


	In the 2023 filings previously obtained by Rolling Stone, Hall claimed that he was “deeply troubled” that Oates entered into an agreement with Primary Wave in what he called a breach of their partnership agreement. He claimed Oates was required to get his written approval. “I was blindsided,” Hall wrote. “I have no intention of becoming partners with Primary Wave, and the Oates Trust cannot be permitted to thrust a new partner upon me in this outrageous fashion.”


	In a dueling declaration filed at the same time, Oates said he was “tremendously disappointed” that Hall chose to make such “inflammatory, outlandish, and inaccurate statements about me.” He said their dispute was already part of a private mediation and private arbitration, and Hall was the one causing harm.


	“I have no idea who or what is motivating Daryl to take these steps and make such salacious statements, but I am deeply hurt,” Oates wrote. He said over the last 50 years, he has devoted himself to ensuring that fans and the music industry “perceive the Hall & Oates music and brand in the most positive light.”


	The judge paused the sale of Oates' stake pending the completion of the arbitration process. The status report was filed on Monday after the court asked for an update.

	Oates declined to discuss details of the legal battle when he spoke with Rolling Stone last year about his new solo LP Reunion. But he said his focus shifted in recent years, and that involved a move away from Hall & Oates.


	“I'll tell you what changed,” he says. “During the pandemic, there were no more private planes. There were no more arena shows or even acoustic shows. It gave me a chance to step back. I had a chance to reevaluate things. My wife and I decided it was time to give back. We started the Oates Song Fest for Feeding America, and we fed 350,000 families with that. And then I was asked to do Movember, which was a men's health movement. I just got out of the mode of getting back on stage with the big band and the big production.”

	











	Asked if there was an official end date that should be added to the Hall & Oates Wikipedia page, he declined to speak for Hall. “But, yes. As far as I'm concerned, I've moved on. I feel like I have a new lease on my creative life,” he says.

	“A good friend of mine said something to me when this was all starting. He said, ‘John, you were a musician before you met Daryl, and you're still a musician. You're an individual.' And Daryl and I have always called ourselves Daryl Hall and John Oates, because we always wanted to be perceived as two individuals who work together. That was very important to us. If you look at the albums, you'll see that on every album. And so this is the ultimate expression of that.”

	Swifties are done seeing the world of The Tortured Poets Department in black and white. Now, The Life of a Showgirl, the forthcoming 12th studio album from Taylor Swift, has drenched their reality in screaming color — shades of orange and teal, to be exact. The record marks the fifth album from the singer-songwriter in five years — not counting her re-recording series — but her fans never tire of the thrill of vindication. The hints and easter eggs that could have passed for symptoms of psychosis before might have been real all along. New era, same classic antics.

Goodnight showgirls I'll see you for more psychosis tomorrow pic.twitter.com/7R2bXy3sOL


	“It's so fun to be a fan of the zodiac killer in pop star form,” a Swiftie named Lacey wrote on X a few hours before the official announcement of the new album arrived at 12:12 a.m. EST on Tuesday. “The excitement I feel when the cryptic hints start to take form. Nobody does it like Taylor!” 


	The high of the album announcement has some fans feeling like they could lift a car with one hand, or single-handedly speed up the passage of time. They don't even know how long they have to go before Swift releases the album, or even unveils the first single. “A Taylor Swift announcement followed by a 48-hour wait for the cover & release date should actually be considered psychological warfare,” Swiftie Josefina said on X.

	











	Combing through the past few years of Swift's content, fans have noticed nods to the Showgirl era stretching all the way back to 2022, when she released Midnights. “With ‘The Life of a Show Girl,' I'm revisiting the narrative of ‘Bejeweled.' Remember that Tay is a show girl for the whole video, it's the way she can win. Everything in the elevator and the tower she climbs is in the art deco style, the roaring 20s and the showgirls of the era,” another X user, Gaby, shared. Others have pointed out that in the elevator scene from “Bejeweled,” the buttons to the 2nd and 10th floors are orange, another nod to the number 12.

the album title gives me such bejeweled energy idk why ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥#THELIFEOFASHOWGIRL pic.twitter.com/Wsc5f6FQw7


	More hints were apparently hidden in the Eras Tour. In the “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” video, captured during the tour, fans realized that Swift rehearsed with orange burlesque feather fans. Some Swifties are taking it a bit further. “SWIFTIES I JUST REALIZED ANOTHER INSANE EASTER EGG,” one account, JB, announced on X. “‘Applause' by Lady Gaga – which played in the pre show of every night of the Eras Tour – was released on AUGUST 12TH.” (The song also turns 12 years old today, but surely that could just be a twisted coincidence).


	Swifties are digging into color theory (likely thing for them to do), too. “Super into whoever brought up the oxidation of copper with the color scheme,” a fan named Joy wrote. “The inevitable degradation and unwanted changes in appearance that come with a woman aging in the limelight….” The original post, already viral, was from a fan named Kaitlyn. “The colour scheme is copper oxidizing because a showgirl is on a pedestal for the world and over time,” she said. “In the public eye they lose their shine… the weathering from being the target for the world's misogyny.”


	Fans have pointed out parallels to fictional characters that were showgirls in their own universe — like Lucy Gray Baird in Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, or Carrie Bradshaw when she finds out that Big is moving to Paris.

	Swift hasn't directly addressed fans quite yet. She will appear on boyfriend Travis Kelce's podcast New Heights on Wednesday, and revealed the album title in the teaser for the episode. But overnight, Spotify billboards appeared with a code to access a playlist titled “And baby, that's show business for you” full of Swift songs. Coincidentally, all of the songs included were produced by Max Martin. “Does Spotify even have the infrastructure to handle a Taylor Swift Max Martin and Shellbeck release,” one Swiftie asked. Another added: “Thinking about the fact that there's swifties who don't even know who Max Martin and Shellback are…. ancient texts REVIVED.”

	This has also led many fans to believe Swift's most consistent collaborator, Jack Antonoff, was not involved with the project. “Jack Antonoff I love you and your synthesizer dearly and will defend you until the day I die but Max Martin and Shellback I am welcoming you back with arms wide open,” Swiftie Holly wrote about Swift's other 1989 and Reputation collaborators. Another added: “Aaron Dessner, we might not meet you at midnight for the album release but I do believe we will meet you at 1 am for some bonus tracks.”

	With The Life of a Showgirl on the way, Swifties are ready for their closeup — kind of. “Being the office swiftie is so humiliating, like I have to go to bed knowing I'm in for a whole press junket tomorrow,” one user wrote. It's showtime.

The Math Trick Hidden in Your Credit Card Number

Find out how this simple algorithm from the 1960s keeps your wallet safe

By Jack Murtagh edited by Jeanna Bryner

Isabel Pavia/Getty Images

You're at the checkout screen after an online shopping spree, ready to enter your credit card number. You type it in and instantly see a red error message: “Please enter a valid credit card number.” Annoyed, you scan back through each digit and spot the culprit: you tapped the 6 key where a 5 belonged. Typo corrected; purchase complete. But how did the website detect your error so quickly? Does the online platform keep a master list of every valid credit card number to compare your entry against? Did it ping your bank in a split second? The explanation is much cleverer.

All mainstream credit card numbers obey a mathematical trick designed to catch the most common typos. It's called the Luhn algorithm, named after IBM researcher Hans Peter Luhn, who patented it in 1960. Similar error-checking schemes lurk in many of the numbers you encounter daily: barcodes, package tracking numbers, bank account numbers and even ISBNs on books.

Grab a credit card from your wallet, and you'll find it contains more structure than first glance suggests. The anatomy of a credit card number includes four main parts. To demonstrate, I'll use my personal Visa. [Stretch your math muscles with these puzzles]

The first digit is the major industry identifier. Visas always begin with a 4, and Discovers always start with a 6. The next five to seven digits pinpoint the bank or institution that issued the card. What remains (sans the final digit) is your specific account number within that bank. The final digit, sometimes called the “check digit,” has nothing to do with financial institutions. Issuers tack it on so that the whole card number will satisfy a specific mathematical test—the Luhn algorithm. Here's how the algorithm works:

Write out all but the last digit of the card number.

Double every other number starting at the right.

Sum the resulting digits (not numbers). E.g., if you doubled a 7 to become a 14 in Step 2, this will become 1 + 4 = 5 in this step.

Add the check digit to the sum. If the result is not a multiple of 10, then the credit card number is invalid.

I'll show the Luhn algorithm in action on my Visa, but you should try it with your credit card, too.

Amanda Montañez

The number crunching culminates in 75, which is not a multiple of 10. So this cannot be my real credit card number; I must have mistyped it.

Credit card issuers first assign the account numbers and then compute steps one through three of the Luhn algorithm to determine the appropriate check digit. In this case, the card number should have ended in a 3 because 67 + 3 = 70, a multiple of 10.

This particular dance of digits has come to dominate credit card verification because of its simplicity and powerful set of features. If you mess up any single digit when entering your card number, the Luhn algorithm will detect it. If you accidentally swap adjacent card digits while inputting, it will detect that, too (with the one exception of flipping 09 to 90, or vice versa).

Dutch mathematician Jacobus Verhoeff reported in 1969 that two errors—mistyping a single digit and swapping two neighboring digits of one's card number—account for nearly 90 percent of all human input errors in practice. Verhoeff developed an even more comprehensive algorithm that, in addition to detecting all of the same typos as Luhn's algorithm, also catches 09/90 transpositions, as well as more exotic slipups. Verhoeff's algorithm was a mathematical triumph. Some contemporaries had even published false proofs claiming that no single check digit could carry enough information to catch all of these errors. Verhoeff's algorithm never gained widespread adoption, however, perhaps because of its increased complexity over Luhn's or because Luhn's algorithm was already deployed and did a sufficient job.

Luhn's algorithm saves you time and businesses money. At some point during a purchase, a vendor will verify that your card belongs to you by sending your information to a specialized card-validation service. This communication takes time and incurs processing fees for the business. It would be a waste of seconds and cents to outsource needless back-and-forth with a professional validation service to catch common typos. Because Luhn's algorithm requires so little processing power, the computer handling the transaction can also run the check without needing to contact any third party.

Importantly, passing Luhn's algorithm does not guarantee a valid credit card number. Rather failing it guarantees an invalid credit card number. The algorithm puts up a first line of defense that less common typos and savvy fraudsters can slip through. Those cases get caught by the more resource-intensive card-validation services.

How does Luhn's algorithm know when your fingers fumble? Every digit in a credit card number contributes a one-digit number to the final sum in the algorithm. If the digit sits in a position that does not get doubled, then it just contributes itself to the sum. But even if a digit sits in a doubled position, summing the individual digits of the resulting two-digit number always yields a one-digit number again. The table below lists all of these possible contributions:

Amanda Montañez

For example, 6 contributes 6 when it's in an undoubled position and it contributes 3 from a doubled position because 6 doubled equals 12 and 1 + 2 = 3. Messing up a single number while typing your credit card effectively shifts you up or down within the same column of this table and alters one term in the algorithm's sum. By design, a valid credit card number results in a sum that is a multiple of 10. Any single-digit error will change the sum by a one-digit number, so the mistaken sum will definitely not be a multiple of 10.

Formally proving that Luhn's algorithm detects swapping adjacent digits involves some case analysis, but an example will help illustrate the idea. Imagine we have the sequence 31 in our credit card, with the 3 in a doubled position. We accidentally enter 13 instead. In the correct sum, this duo contributes 6 + 1 = 7 (3 doubled plus 1 undoubled), whereas in the faulty sum, it contributes 2 + 3 = 5 (1 doubled plus 3 undoubled). So the error ultimately changes our sum by 2: going from a contribution of 7 to a contribution of 5. If the original sum yielded a multiple of 10, then there's no way this new one will. We can check that this works for every pair of numbers except for 09/90, which both contribute the same quantity to the Luhn sum.

Next time a checkout page flashes that annoying error message, remember: a simple piece of math under the hood just saved a little time and money for everyone involved.

It's a strange tale of two hemispheres. 

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Scientists from the University of Oslo say one side of Earth's interior is losing heat much faster than the other side—and the culprit is practically as old as time.

A study published in Geophysical Research Letters uses computer models of the last 400 million years to calculate how “insulated” each hemisphere was by continental mass, which is a key quality that holds heat inside instead of releasing it. The pattern goes all the way back to Pangaea.

Earth has a red hot liquid interior that warms the entire planet from inside. It spins, too, generating both gravity and Earth's magnetic field. This holds our protective atmosphere close to Earth's surface. 

Over the extremely long term, this interior will continue to cool until Earth is more like Mars. The surprise in the study is how unevenly the heat is dissipating, but the reason makes intuitive sense: Parts of Earth have been insulated by more landmass, creating something of a Thermos layer that traps heat.

This contrasts with how Earth loses most of its heat: “Earth's thermal evolution is largely controlled by the rate of heat loss through the oceanic lithosphere,” the study authors write. Why is this the site of the greatest loss? For that, we need a quick-and-dirty run-through of continental drift. 

Earth's mantle is like a convection oven that powers a treadmill. Every day, seafloor surface moves a tiny bit; new seafloor is born from the magma that erupts at the continental divide, while old seafloor is smashed and melted beneath existing continental landmass.

To study how Earth's interior heat behaves, the scientists built a model that divides Earth into African and Pacific hemispheres, then divides Earth's entire surface into a grid by half degrees latitude and longitude. 

The scientists combined several previous models for things like seafloor age and continental positions during the last 400 million years. Then, the team crunched the numbers for how much heat each grid cell contains over its long life. This paved the way to calculate the rate of cooling overall, where the researchers found the Pacific side has cooled much faster.

The seafloor is far thinner than the bulky landmass, and temperature from within Earth is “quenched” by the enormous volume of cold water that's above it. Think of the gigantic Pacific Ocean compared with the opposite-side landmasses of Africa, Europe, and Asia—it makes sense that heat dissipates more quickly from the biggest seafloor in the world. 

Previous research on this seafloor effect only went back 230 million years, meaning the new model, which goes back 400 million years, almost doubles the timeframe being studied.

There's a surprising contradiction in the findings. The Pacific hemisphere has cooled about 50 Kelvin more than the African hemisphere, but the “consistently higher plate velocities of the Pacific hemisphere during the past 400 [million years]” suggest the Pacific was much hotter at a certain moment in time.

Was it covered by landmass at some point in the far distant past, keeping more heat inside? There are other possible explanations, but either way, the Pacific's high tectonic activity today points to a heat disparity. The meltier the mantle, the more the plates can slide and slam together.

Cats with dementia have brain changes similar to those of people with Alzheimer's disease, offering a valuable model for studying the condition in humans, a study says.

Scientists discovered a build-up of the toxic protein amyloid-beta in the brains of cats with the condition – one of the defining features of Alzheimer's disease.

The findings offer a clearer picture of how amyloid-beta may lead to age-related brain dysfunction and memory loss in cats, experts say.

Many older cats develop dementia, leading to behavioural changes such as increased vocalisation – or meowing – confusion and disrupted sleep – symptoms similar to those seen in people with Alzheimer's disease.

Scientists at the University of Edinburgh examined the brains of 25 cats of different ages after they had passed away, including those with signs of dementia.

Powerful microscopy images revealed a build-up of amyloid-beta within the synapses – connections between brain cells – of older cats and cats with dementia.

Synapses allow the flow of messages between brain cells and are vital to healthy brain function. Their loss strongly predicts reduced memory and thinking abilities in humans with Alzheimer's disease.

The research team also found evidence that astrocytes and microglia – types of support cells in the brain – engulfed or 'ate' the affected synapses. This process, called synaptic pruning, is important during brain development but can contribute to synapse loss in dementia.

Experts say the findings will not only help to understand and manage dementia in cats but, given their similarities, could also contribute to the development of future treatments for people with Alzheimer's disease.

Scientists studying Alzheimer's disease in the past have relied heavily on genetically modified rodent models. Rodents do not naturally develop dementia, and studying cats with dementia has the potential to advance knowledge and help develop treatments for both cats and people, experts say.

The study, funded by Wellcome and the UK Dementia Research Institute, is published in the journal European Journal of Neuroscience: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejn.70180 [URL will become active after embargo lifts]. The research team included scientists from the Universities of Edinburgh and California, UK Dementia Research Institute and Scottish Brain Sciences.

Dementia is a devastating disease - whether it affects humans, cats, or dogs. Our findings highlight the striking similarities between feline dementia and Alzheimer's disease in people. This opens the door to exploring whether promising new treatments for human Alzheimer's disease could also help our ageing pets. Because cats naturally develop these brain changes, they may also offer a more accurate model of the disease than traditional laboratory animals, ultimately benefiting both species and their caregivers.""

Dr. Robert McGeachan, study lead from the University of Edinburgh's Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies

Professor Danièlle Gunn-Moore, Personal Chair of Feline Medicine at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, said: ""Feline dementia is so distressing for the cat and for its person. It is by undertaking studies like this that we will understand how best to treat them. This will be wonderful for the cats, their owners, people with Alzheimer's and their loved ones. Feline dementia is the perfect natural model for Alzheimer's, everyone benefits.""

Second seed Coco Gauff of the United States advanced to the fourth round of the WTA and ATP Cincinnati Open by walkover

Second seed Coco Gauff moved into the ATP and WTA Cincinnati Open fourth round on Tuesday when opponent Dayana Yastremska withdrew before their scheduled Tuesday match.

The 21-year-old American, the reigning French Open champion who won the 2023 Cincinnati title and followed up with a US Open crown, will next face either former Roland Garros champion Jelena Ostapenko of Latvia or Italian Lucia Bronzetti.

Ukraine's Yastremska was unable to play due to illness, the WTA said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","WATCH: Sabalenka, Swiatek surprise diehard fans, blow their minds","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4339590/iga-swiatek-aryna-sabalenka-surprise-fans","Tue, 12 Aug 2025 19:08:36 GMT","

Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek surprised some of their most loyal fans at the Cincinnati Open, answering their questions live and then unknowingly joining them for a conversation and hug.

The Cincinnati Open is famously known for its unparalleled access to players, but this is taking it to a whole different level.

This week at the WTA 1000 event in Mason, Ohio, a select number of lucky fans were given the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to record messages for their favorite players on the Fan Cam.

Little did they know, the players -- World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, No. 3 Iga Swiatek and the top two men's players in the world, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz -- were standing 5 yards away from them, listening closely to every word they were saying.

The tennis stars got a kick out of the fan comments, with Sabalenka showing a heart sign upon hearing the fans praise her authenticity and Swiatek playfully growling after hearing that she's an ""animal.""

Given an opportunity to ask questions -- which they presumably would never hear the answers to, or so they thought -- the fans were floored when the players immediately answered them in real time.

""It's pretty cool, to be honest,"" Sabalenka casually answered a young girl, who asked her what it's like to be the No. 1 player in the world. 

""Oh my gosh, you're live?"" a diehard Swiatek fan said, bewildered and looking like she was about to come out of her shoes. 

And as if that wasn't epic enough, there was a second surprise, and this one was even more special.

Swiatek and the others informed the fans that they had a little gift for them, at the back of the room. When they headed there, they were blown away to find their favorite players in the flesh, quietly standing behind them and photobombing. The fans got some hugs and a bit of conversation -- Sabalenka called one of her young fans a ""future superstar"" -- the perfect bow on the ultimate tennis bucket-list moment, one they'll surely never forget.

Sabalenka, the defending champion in Cincinnati, is into the fourth round after a thrilling three-hour, three-set win over 30th seed Emma Raducanu. She'll play Jessica Bouzas Maneiro for a spot in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. Swiatek is also in the fourth round after 25th seed Marta Kostyuk withdrew with a right wrist injury. She'll play Sorana Cirstea on Wednesday.

Audiences are arguing over the meaning (or lack thereof) behind Zach Cregger's horror hit — but the truth is there's no such thing as a correct answer when it comes to the film.


							By 

	Richard Newby



[This story contains spoilers for Weapons.]


Zach Cregger's Weapons is the latest horror success story in a year when epic studio horror films with large casts and even larger ambitions have thrived, like Sinners, Final Destination: Bloodlines and 28 Years Later. After eclipsing box office projections and sending enthusiastic audiences home with heightened pulses and more than a few chuckles (at least until all the lights go off and only the nightmares remain), Weapons has dominated film-centric conversations on social media for days.

	Cregger's twisty tale features a unique tapestry of intersecting characters played by Julia Garner, Josh Brolin, Alden Ehrenreich, Benedict Wong, Austin Abrams, and Cary Christopher, all caught up in the mysterious disappearance of 17 children.

	It's no surprise the film has led to discussions about its deeper meaning. But the most frustrating point among them is the argument shared by several critics and a wider collection of the audience that the film doesn't have a deeper meaning and is ultimately about nothing. Rather, the argument goes, audiences are placing meaning into the film because years of so-called elevated horror have trained them to expect —and thus look for — surface-level meaning. It is a claim that I find not only false but anti-analytical because of course Weapons is about something. It's about so many things that to even limit it to one feels reductive.

	











	It is both a blessing and a curse that we have so much access to the thoughts of artists by way of the internet and social media. On the one hand, it makes the intentions of an artist harder to misconstrue. On the other hand, it has made us complacent thinkers. Websites and Reddit threads spoon-feed audiences with headlines like “What Does the Ending of This Movie Mean,” and if it's not that, its journalists writing full summaries of a film's ending so that folks can lend their voice to the discourse without even needing to have seen the film in question.  


	As a film-going culture, we've lost some of our curiosity in an effort to find homogeneous and simplified answers, when in many cases simple answers aren't even the priority for most filmmakers.


	Cregger spoke recently to The Hollywood Reporter about the inception of Weapons, and he described it as an emotional reaction to the death of his best friend and trying to process that loss. Though Cregger has not named his friend in any of his interviews, those familiar with Cregger's work agree that he's talking about Trevor Moore, the beloved comedian, musician, and filmmaker who was a founding member of the comedy troupe The Whitest Kids U' Know (WKUK), along with Cregger. Weapons was released on Aug. 7, the fourth anniversary of Moore's death. 


	Beyond the film's consideration of loss, it's also genuinely and intentionally funny. There is character-driven humor and pointed reminders of the absurdity of life that feels like a successor to some of WKUK's sketch comedy moments.

	











	Going further back into his personal life, Cregger also revealed that the final chapter of the film with Alex (Christopher) and his parents was inspired by his father's alcoholism, as well as his own. “The idea that this foreign entity comes into your home, and it changes your parent, and you have to deal with this new behavioral pattern that you don't understand and don't have the equipment to deal with,” he told THR. Through Cregger's lens, Weapons is, in part, about loss and alcoholism. He figured out what it was about during the writing process, while still not having answers for everything, like the giant AK-47 that floats above Archer Graff's (Brolin) house. 


	Undeniably, Weapons is about something. But it's also important to emphasize that Cregger's lens is not the final statement on the film and doesn't negate other viewpoints.  


	There is this rush to deny any other readings of the film with common refrains like, “Actually, Cregger said it's about this,” or “You're reading too much into it.” While Weapons is clearly personal to Cregger, it's not a private journal entry. It is public art, something given to audiences so that they may apply their own lens to it. 


	It's profoundly silly to argue with folks who say Weapons is about gun violence and gun control, child trafficking, the breakdown of communities, and warring community leaders. Because how often do we look at art as being one thing, or existing solely what the filmmaker says it is? If we did, there would be a lot less writing on the works of Bob Dylan and David Lynch. We'd have to agree with William Friedkin that The Exorcist is not a horror film and deny crucial conversations surrounding AIDS because David Cronenberg said that wasn't his intention. Intentionality is an interesting road to travel down, but far less interesting when it comes to the staying power of art.

	











	Before I read any interviews or theories on Weapons, I sat with the film and considered how it made me feel and what it made me think about. The most recurring images I conjured were that of Hansel and Gretel and the breadcrumbs leading to the witch's house. Only in this case, the breadcrumbs were left in vodka bottles, used syringes, and cherry red paint. 


	For me, Weapons is a fucked-up fairy tale that plays with childhood fears of strangers, old people, wigs, and getting lost, that then finds a way to drag the classic horror archetype of the witch, Aunt Gladys (Amy Madigan) into contemporary times to prey parental fears — fears of your own child being killed, or kidnapped, or vanishing because so many outside forces, the internet, their peers, their teachers, that vie for our children's attention and have such an inexplicable hold on them that it feels close enough to witchcraft. 


	The central source of anxiety I found in the dark basement of Weapons was the question of Who is shaping our children and what are they being shaped into? We've certainly seen the influence people like Andrew Tate, Jordan Petersen, and Ben Shapiro have had on poisoning young minds, and raising them on tenets of misogyny, racism, greed and self-interest. I'd be hesitant to call what they're doing anything less than weapons manufacturing meant to harm our society.


	My Heat Vision colleague Brian Davids and I discussed a somewhat different take on what Weapons is about. He said, considering the film's ending, Weapons is about “the younger generation turning the tables on the older generation after suffering the effects of either their trauma or the trauma they create by upholding harmful systems and legislations.” Essentially, Aunt Gladys serves as a representative of that older generation, feeding off the young to stay in power. 

	











	In the children's final acts of defiance, they tear Gladys limb from bloody limb, effectively ending her reign of terror and freeing themselves for what Davids ultimately refers to as an anti-generational trauma film, a concept that I believe is supported by the film's final lines, “some of them even started talking again this year,” suggesting that they're able to heal from their experience. 


	In some ways, Weapons works as the opposite of Longlegs, which was concerned with how parents often hide things from their children, only for those children to be traumatized years later when they discover these hidden secrets, and then later  pass that trauma onto their children in an unending cycle. Weapons seems to break such cycles, leaving no more devils hiding in basements or upstairs bedrooms playing with dolls or ribbons of hair.


	In an interview with The Playlist Cregger said, “I wasn't trying to comment on or even tap into collective societal tragedies… wasn't thinking, ‘Oh, America,' at all.'  Yet, for those who see America in Weapons, as I do, as Brian Davids does, and countless others do, they aren't wrong. 


	Going back to that THR interview, Cregger dropped this nugget of truth: “it's not really my business what people make of the movie. I have nothing to say about it, because the movies should speak for itself, and if I have to comment on what people should get from it, then I've failed as a filmmaker.” 


	In seems to me that many of us are concerned about beating movies, solving them before others and then being afraid to get the “what was it really about?” question wrong in front of judgmental peers. But ultimately, I believe that's a disservice to film analysis, and to the films themselves. We've weaponized the idea of being right or wrong about movies, and it's a boring state to be in. There's no harm done in taking an educated analytical swing in good-faith, because every piece of art is about something, many things, and that's what keeps art alive.

The Prime Video sci-fi comedy from creator Greg Daniels will debut its final season on Aug. 25.

Upload's return promises dark AI, chinchilla life coaches and a love story for the (digital) ages in the new trailer for the Prime Video series' final season. 


	The sci-fi comedy's four-part finale event was previously teased during San Diego Comic-Con with a look at Aleesha's (Zainab Johnson) new life as a spy tasked with infiltrating Horizon, the company in charge of running Lakeview. Now, as part of a new two-minute teaser (below), the Prime Video series picks up where season three left off, revealing the fate of Robbie Amell's two Nathans inside that digital afterlife.

	As a ragged-looking Nora (Andy Allo) discovers her version of Nathan has seemingly succumbed to deletion and somehow returned as a digital ghost, she sets out to not only convince the others that he's alive, but to save and reunite with him. 


	Meanwhile, Ingrid (Allegra Edwards) and her Nathan navigate the unique challenges of a virtual relationship, alongside Nathan and Luke (Kevin Bigley) affirming their friendship as the rest of Lakeview faces new threats. That includes ownership focused on increasing monetization, a tall, dark and threatening AI Guy (Owen Daniels), and the potential full-blown destruction of Lakeview with everyone inside. 


	The four-part finale event promises one final battle as a new sentient evil AI threatens to wipe out the world, testing the series' core ensemble — Nathan, Nora, Ingrid, Aleesha, Luke and AI Guy — like never before. 


	Created by Greg Daniels, who also serves as executive producer along with Howard Klein and Maxwell Vivian, Upload's fourth and final season will premiere on Aug. 25.
