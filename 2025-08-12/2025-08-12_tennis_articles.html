                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Cincinnati Open is famously known for its unparalleled access to players, but this is taking it to a whole different level. This week at the WTA 1000 event in Mason, Ohio, a select number of lucky fans were given the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to record messages for their favorite players on the Fan Cam. Little did they know, the players -- World No. 3 Iga Swiatek and the top two men's players in the world, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz -- were standing 5 yards away from them, listening closely to every word they were saying. The tennis stars got a kick out of the fan comments, with Sabalenka showing a heart sign upon hearing the fans praise her authenticity and Swiatek playfully growling after hearing that she's an "animal." Given an opportunity to ask questions -- which they presumably would never hear the answers to, or so they thought -- the fans were floored when the players immediately answered them in real time. "It's pretty cool, to be honest," Sabalenka casually answered a young girl, who asked her what it's like to be the No. a diehard Swiatek fan said, bewildered and looking like she was about to come out of her shoes. When they headed there, they were blown away to find their favorite players in the flesh, quietly standing behind them and photobombing. The fans got some hugs and a bit of conversation -- Sabalenka called one of her young fans a "future superstar" -- the perfect bow on the ultimate tennis bucket-list moment, one they'll surely never forget. Sabalenka, the defending champion in Cincinnati, is into the fourth round after a thrilling three-hour, three-set win over 30th seed Emma Raducanu. She'll play Jessica Bouzas Maneiro for a spot in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. Swiatek is also in the fourth round after 25th seed Marta Kostyuk withdrew with a right wrist injury.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Goran Ivanisevic had big hopes for Elena Rybakina when he coached her earlier this year. Ivanisevic only coached Rybakina for two tournaments, before leaving her team after the Australian Open. Since then, Rybakina has been coached by Davide Sanguinetti, while also being in regular contact with Stefano Vukov before he was able to return to the WTA Tour from his suspension. Despite the coaching relationship not being particularly successful, Ivanisevic did have big hopes for Rybakina. Seven months after their coaching partnership came to an end, it has now been revealed how much potential Ivanisevic actually thinks Rybakina has. Former top five ranked players Dinara Safina and Anna Chakvetadze recently interviewed Ivanisevic for their podcast, and the former has now revealed that the Croatian told them something off podcast. According to Chakvetadze, Ivanisevic believes that Rybakina should be winning at least three or four Wimbledon titles. The former world number five said, “When we interviewed Goran Ivanisevic, he said off-camera ‘I don't understand, she has such an amazing game, she should be winning more tournaments on grass, not one Wimbledon but 3-4 at least.” Anna Chakvetadze about Elena Rybakina on podcast with Dinara Safina:"When we interviewed Goran Ivanisevic, he said off-camera 'I don't understand, she has such an amazing game, she should be winning more tournaments on grass, not one Wimbledon but 3-4 at least." While she has reached the latter stages of Wimbledon since, Rybakina has been unable to add to her Grand Slam trophy cabinet since then.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 Jannik Sinner has already booked his place in round four, and former finalist Carlos Alcaraz will be hoping to join him when he takes on Hamad Medjedovic. 1 and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka survived a huge scare in her own third-round match, as Emma Raducanu pushed her to the brink before losing 7-6 4-6 7-6. It was an impressive performance from Raducanu, who was told off by the umpire for communicating a little too much with her new coach, Francisco Roig, during the first set. But the conditions have been brutal so far in Cincinnati. Cameron Norrie and Daniil Medvedev struggled with the heat over the weekend and things took a turn on Monday when Arthur Rinderknech collapsed in the middle of his match against Felix Auger-Aliassime, and retired a few games later. You can follow LIVE tennis news below... Grigor Dimitrov has officially pulled out of the US Open. The Bulgarian suffered an injury at Wimbledon and has been missing in action ever since. Alejandro Tabilo will take the Bulgarian star's spot instead. It brings an end to a remarkable run of 58 Grand Slam main draw appearances. Francisco Comesana appears to be struggling with the conditions. He's taken himself to the side of the court and currently has his head in his hands. Alexei Popyrin digs deep to take the opening set against Andrey Rublev. Alexei Popyrin and Andrey Rublev are locked at 6-6 in the first set. Taylor Fritz believes he and Elena Rybakina are the team to beat at the revamped US Open mixed doubles event next week. The pair won the Indian Wells exhibition earlier this year and have more experience together than blockbuster pairings like Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz. 4 told Tennis Channel: "I really do think we're one of the favourites. I'd love to play mixed doubles regularly if it didn't overlap with singles, but being able to play it before the week starts is amazing. 21 was forced to retire when he hurt his pectoral muscle mid-match at Wimbledon. Dimitrov was on course to pull off a huge upset when he led world No. But he suddenly went down in pain and was left in tears as he forfeited the match. It was Dimitrov's fifth successive mid-match retirement at a Grand Slam tournament. 3 later shared a photo on Instagram, showing himself in a hospital bed, and wrote: “Thank you for the overwhelming wave of love - from family, friends, fans, colleagues, to the entire tennis community… your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times. He has not played a match since, and will now miss the US Open. 14 joins Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, Tommy Paul, and Joao Fonseca on World's squad, which is now led by a new captain in Andre Agassi. I love playing for Team World and competing alongside guys who are usually my rivals. Playing at home in front of U.S. fans means a lot – and I want to do everything I can to help us win.” Emma Raducanu has added another event to her packed tennis schedule. Less than 24 hours after she suffered a tight defeat to world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in Cincinnati, it was confirmed that Raducanu will make her Toray Pan Pacific Open debut this year. The American is known for her calm demeanour and rarely gets super fired up during matches. While she's commended for her cool and collected approach now, Pegula was previously told she had a "bad attitude". Appearing on the Tennis Insider Club podcast, she said: "When I was growing up, everyone always - and I say everyone is in, my parents or my coaches at the time - like never really liked my attitude. I always kind of had a bad attitude. I think then I just started kind of being more emotional and maybe a little bit more like bad attitude." 4 suffered a shock first-round exit at Wimbledon, and then lost her opening match in Washington. But Pegula is keen to bounce back in Cincinnati this week. She said: I'm playing good tennis, but sometimes taking control of the momentum and those big points is something that I just haven't been able to execute coming off of Wimbledon. "It's frustrating, but at the same time, you just keep working and trying to problem solve and figure out. Jack Draper is preparing to make his return at the US Open after an arm injury forced him to skip the Masters 1000 events in Canada and Cincinnati. 1 - who has not played a match since Wimbledon - had also signed up for the new US Open mixed doubles event. After his first partner, Qinwen Zheng, was forced to withdraw after having surgery, he re-entered with Paula Badosa. But Badosa has also pulled out, and it's not known whether Draper will attempt to play with a third teammate. For now, he's excited to get back on the court in New York. Draper told the LTA: “I got back to my tennis slowly to protect my arm, but it's been a really productive few weeks now. It was disappointing to miss Toronto and Cincinnati, but I think it's been a good period for me to reflect on things and improve. “I'm really looking forward to going out to the US Open, and I'm in a great place personally and tennis-wise. Felix Auger-Aliassime has spoken out on the brutal conditions in Cincinnati after his opponent, Arthur Rinderknech, collapsed during their match on Monday and soon retired. “It feels like we're in an oven, even for the fans. “A friendly reminder to everyone: drink plenty of water, bring hats, and cool off as much as possible.” Darwin Blanch - the 17-year-old who was thrashed by Rafael Nadal at last year's Madrid Open - won the boys' title. Meanwhile, 18-year-old Ahn, who is set to play college tennis at Stanford, won the girls' title. Runners-up Jack Satterfield and Maya Iyengar are set to receive qualifying wildcards. Venus Williams recently returned from a 16-month hiatus, reaching the second round in both singles and doubles in Washington. After losing her opening match in Cincinnati, she will turn her attention to the US Open, where she has entered the revamped mixed doubles event with Reilly Opelka. But Rick Macci, an important figure in the Williams sisters' early development as tennis players who went on to coach both Venus and Serena, has suggested that Serena could also make a return in Flushing Meadows and play women's doubles with her sister. “Asked if Serena will play doubles with Vee at the OPEN. My gut is probably because at the end of the day Serena can still play even though she has been away,” Macci tweeted. “Her serve is still one of the best on the planet and when she competes her mindset is like granite.” Emma Raducanu wasn't the only player with a new coach at this year's Cincinnati Open. Aryna Sabalenka recently added former doubles No. 1 Max Mirnyi to her team, and she wants him to help with her skills at the net. The top seed beat Raducanu 7-6 4-6 7-6 in the third round on Monday and admitted that their work had already paid off. “I was brave enough to come to the net and take risks with some shots I've been working on for the last couple of weeks,” the reigning Cincinnati champion explained. “Max is very happy with my volley, but at the same time, he thinks it's too risky. The Cincinnati Open marked Emma Raducanu's first tournament with new coach Francisco Roig in her corner. Roig spent years working with Rafael Nadal, and he had a successful post-Wimbledon trial week with Raducanu before they officially joined forces in Cincinnati. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in a 7-6 4-6 7-6 defeat with a vocal Roig cheering her on, Raducanu expressed some early optimism about their new partnership. She said: I think the first week went well. "I made some improvements and I think for certain moments, you could see some stuff we practised peek through. For now, he's busy getting some reps in on the Challenger Tour. But his ranking has dropped to No. 152 in the world, and he regularly competes on the Challenger circuit to get more matches and ranking points under his belt. It's been a positive tournament for the Frenchmen in Cincinnati this year. 13 seed Tommy Paul on Monday, coming back to win 5-7 6-3 6-4. Benjamin Bonzi also mounted a comeback to beat Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(4) 6-3 6-4. And Terence Atmane, another qualifier, took out teenage sensation Joao Fonseca 6-3 6-4. 1 Aryna Sabalenka has joked that Emma Raducanu made her feel like she was "getting old" during their three-hour, three-set match on Monday. Aged 27, Sabalenka is only five years older than Raducanu, but she felt the heat during her 7-6 4-6 7-6 victory and said: "The whole time I've been thinking, this is what they call aging. I was like, ‘This is how it feels to be old.' I looked at Jason [Stacy, her fitness coach], didn't say anything, but we need to do something because I'm getting old." The US Open's revamped mixed doubles event gets underway next week. Only 16 teams will get to compete over two days, with eight entries being determined by their best combined singles ranking, and the other eight teams getting wildcards. But there has been plenty of backlash to the overhaul, especially from doubles specialists, who can no longer enter the tournament using their doubles ranking. Jessica Pegula, who has signed up to play alongside Tommy Paul, has now claimed US Open bosses went "rogue" and made the changes without consulting players. Speaking in Cincinnati, the American said: "We were like, Okay, you guys just went rogue and changed the format and didn't tell anybody. Did you get their input about how it could be better? There was chaos at the Cincinnati Open on Monday when play was suspended for 75 minutes due to a local power outage. Broadcast cameras suddenly cut off around 5pm local time but the matches on court initially continued as normal. But play was halted when it emerged that the tournament had been affected by a power cut. The matches resumed shortly after 6.30pm local time, and Taylor Fritz beat Lorenzo Sonego while Benjamin Bonzi came back to beat Stefanos Tsitsipas. There was another interruption during the night session when a fire alarm went off during Jannik Sinner's showdown with Gabriel Diallo. But after a short delay, they decided to play on. Emma Raducanu was understandably disappointed to come out on the losing end of a three-hour and nine-minute battle with world No. But the Brit is still proud of herself for pushing the world's best player, especially on a surface she feels less confident on. 1 for a reason and I pushed her more than I did at Wimbledon so that's an improvement," Raducanu said, referencing her two-set loss to Sabalenka at SW19 last month. "And also, it was good to have this result on a hard court because it's very different to grass. I was always thinking that grass suits me a lot more and I still believe that so to have pushed her on a hard court like that, I'm pretty proud of it." Defending champion Jannik Sinner survived a tough test against 6ft 8" big-server Gabriel Diallo in the night session on Monday to win 6-2 7-6(6). It was a dramatic match, briefly interrupted by a nearby fire alarm that went off in one of the court's stands, but they decided to play on after a brief delay, and Sinner saved a set point in the second set to get the job done. 1 admitted it was difficult to come through, and got straight back on the practice court after the match was over. "I feel like today was a very difficult day at the office. Today I struggled a bit at times," he said after reaching the fourth round. I'm very happy this happened before a Grand Slam. Rinderknech played on but got broken again and retired with Auger-Aliassime leading 7-6 4-2. Emma Raducanu made a statement during her tight, three-set defeat to Aryna Sabalenka on Monday. The Brit proved that she can stay with the world's best players for hours without dropping her level, as Sabalenka narrowly came out on top in a final set tiebreak in their third-round showdown. But there was one moment of madness for Raducanu, who walked closer to her new coach, Francisco Roig, for a brief chat after holding for 5-4 in the first set. Roig also got out of his chair to communicate better, and the umpire called Raducanu back before telling her they weren't allowed to approach one another. You cannot have a conversation," Miriam Bley said. Raducanu protested that she couldn't hear Roig over the music, but the umpire simply suggested Roig should speak louder. I can't say it like now," the British No. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Grigor Dimitrov, who has been battling an injury since Wimbledon earlier this year, has officially withdrawn from the upcoming US Open. He is the latest big name to withdraw from the tournament, which will have a record-breaking prize fund on offer. Dimitrov sustained a pectoral muscle injury during his match against Sinner and hasn't been able to recover in time for the tournament at Flushing Meadows later this month. This ends his streak of 58 Slam main draws in a row, the longest active streak on the ATP Tour. After his withdrawal from Wimbledon, Dimitrov shared on social media: "Sometimes the heart wants to keep going... but the universe has a different plan for us," he wrote in an Instagram post that included a picture of him in a hospital bed. "Thank you for the overwhelming wave of love - from family, friends, fans, colleagues, to the entire tennis community... your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times. France's Alize Cornet will then occupy the top alternate pot vacated by Teichmann. Badosa announced her tough decision on social media. "It is with a heavy heart that I am announcing my withdrawal from this year's U.S. Open," she wrote. "After the amazing run I had in New York last year and the deep connection I feel with the city and its fans, stepping away from this tournament is very emotional for me. The U.S. Open has always meant a great deal to me, and I have created some of my most special memories there." "I want to thank everyone for the ongoing support," she continued. "Right now I need to focus on my health and recovery so I can return stronger and ready to compete again." The Express uses notifications to keep you updated</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — Three-time Grand Slam semifinalist Grigor Dimitrov withdrew from the U.S. Open on Tuesday, a little more than a month after he tore a chest muscle and had to quit playing against Jannik Sinner at Wimbledon. That exit from the All England Club on July 7 — Dimitrov had taken the opening two sets against Sinner but got hurt in the third — marked the fifth consecutive Grand Slam tournament where the 34-year-old Dimitrov failed to complete a match. It also happened at the Australian Open in January and the French Open in May, plus last year's Wimbledon and U.S. Open. A year ago in New York, Dimitrov stopped while trailing 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3, 4-1 against Frances Tiafoe in the quarterfinals. Dimitrov was a semifinalist at the U.S. Open in 2019, at the Australian Open in 2017, and at Wimbledon in 2014. His highest ranking was No. 3; he is currently No. With Dimitrov out of the field, Alejandro Tabilo gets a spot in the men's singles bracket, which starts play on Aug. 24. Brandon Holt is the next player who would move into the draw if another man withdraws. Holt upset Taylor Fritz at Flushing Meadows in 2022 and his mother is two-time U.S. Open champion Tracy Austin.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack Draper reveals he discovered an arm issue following his shock Wimbledon exit but has since returned to being fully healthy and highlights he is not lacking any motivation ahead of the US Open. After Draper collected his maiden Masters crown in Indian Wells and broke into the top-5, high hopes were placed on him at Wimbledon. 5 do well at The Championships were quickly squashed after he suffered a surprise second-round loss to Marin Cilic. While Draper took all the responsibility and blame for his Wimbledon display, he later withdrew from the Masters tournaments in Toronto and Cincinnati, citing an injury. Now, in an interview with LTA, the 23-year-old said that after The Championships, he found out that he had been playing with an arm injury "for a little while." “The doctors and my team advised me that I'd need to take some time out. Then I was really motivated to come back and do a really good fitness block and work myself hard physically to make some good gains," the world No. After taking some time for himself and fixing his arm issue, Draper says he is in "a great place" now and ecstatic about taking to the US Open courts. Last year, Draper made his maiden Grand Slam semifinal at the US Open before losing to eventual champion Jannik Sinner. 5 not playing any matches ahead of the US Open definitely isn't ideal, but at least he is guaranteed to arrive to New York fresh and healthy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lizzy Banks, a professional women's cyclist who had failed a drugs test and was eventually given a two-year ban, says she struggled to watch Jannik Sinner play the Wimbledon final. “I can't tell you how difficult it was to watch Wimbledon this year. And then he got the most handy time, a three-month sanction, and then he was able to just go straight back to it,” Banks told The Times. Initially, she was given no ban as UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) had agreed that there had been contamination and it was no fault of hers. But WADA refused to accept the opinion of UKAD's expert witness, professor David Cowan, and instead fought for and secured a two-year ban later. Her ordeal began in May 2023 when she took a routine urine test that led to a positive finding for a diuretic called Chrortalidone, which she claims she had not even heard of before. Her conclusion, and which was supported by the professor Cowan after his investigations, was that one of medications she took to treat asthma or a pill she took after a dental treatment perhaps had been contaminated in the manufacturing process. But CAS panel didn't agree to her version and though they described her as a “peroson of integrity”, said that she was unable to prove the source of the contamination and hence warranted a ban, which was back-dated and is now served. It's for this reason that she struggled to watch Sinner play and win Wimbledon. “Then they came out and said this case [Sinner's] is a million miles from doping. Well, how does that make me feel? “I was an athlete of integrity who took the utmost care in her anti-doping responsibilities, who was unknowingly exposed to a contaminant-sized dose of an obsolete diuretic with an impossibility of tracing the source because of a 79-day delay. And so is that really proportional to my career being completely lost, my identity being lost, my health being destroyed for two years, my husband's health being destroyed for two years, loss of earnings for two years, the impact that will have on other earnings in the future.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rivalry continues to heat up between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. In their latest battle, Sinner defeated Alcaraz to become the Wimbledon champion for the first time. Jannik Sinner has been at the summit of the ATP rankings since June 2024, when he overtook Novak Djokovic. “I think Carlos ends the year as number one and he also had a three month head start,” Johnson said. “Sinner was out for four Masters series, so I just think he gets him. But it entirely depends on the big events. You win the Open and it's 2000 points. You lose in the quarters and somebody wins it and they are going to get a 1500 point head start just from that event. I think after his loss at Wimbledon, I think that was a kick in the pants for him to be like I need to be better.” Alcaraz and Sinner's rivalry went up a level this season, as each of their three matches in 2025 have taken place in the final. Alcaraz won a classic match at the French Open, while Sinner won their Wimbledon encounter in four sets. There is every chance the pair could square off in the US Open final in September, but while that remains to be seen, Johnson thinks there will be at least two more Sinner and Alcaraz matches in 2025. They push each other to get better,” Johnson said. “So he sees how good Jannik is playing on hard courts. “This is going to be a great rivalry and I think we are going to see them in a couple more finals throughout the year. I would love to see them in the US Open final, that would be electric, but we are a long way from that.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reflecting on last year's performances, despite the semi-final exit to world No.1 and eventual champion Jannik Sinner, Draper sees that run as the catalyst for what has so far been his most successful season on tour. “Last year's US Open was amazing – I reflect on it with really positive memories. It gave me so much confidence and set me up for what was to come for the rest of the year and also the start of this year. It was a big moment for me and probably one of the biggest in my career so far. It's a lively, energetic crowd, and that gets the best out of me for sure.” Standing in his way last year and likely again this time around will be current US Open, Australian Open, and Wimbledon title-holder Sinner, alongside Roland Garros champion Carlos Alcaraz. “They are playing tennis, which is very exciting to watch; it's electric. Mentally, they are both very experienced now on the big stages, and they are both complete players. Saying that, they can still improve, so it's really exciting to be around them. Currently, Draper is ranked No.7 in the Race to Turin, and a good showing at the US Open could book his place at the Finals for the first time in his career – a significant milestone as a reward for his impressive results this year. “The ATP Finals is definitely something I've got my eyes on,” he admitted. “At the start of the year, it was one of my goals because if you make the Finals, you've had a very consistent season, and that was my biggest thing going into this season to maintain. “Obviously, I've picked up an injury and missed a few tournaments, but like always, I'm going to give it my best.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The year's final Grand Slam announced in February that its mixed doubles competition, which will offer $1 million in prize money, would take place from August 19-20 ahead of the singles main draw the following week. The competition's format was also overhauled to feature a field of 16 teams - half of the 32 teams that competed last year - with eight entries based on the combined singles rankings of players and eight wildcards. Matches will be best of three sets, with short sets to four games, with no-advantage scoring, tiebreakers at four-all and a 10-point tiebreak in lieu of a third set. The final will be a best-of-three set match to six games. The move was described by defending US Open champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori as a "profound injustice" to doubles players, and Pegula, who is part of the WTA Player Council, said more communication was needed between organisers and players. "At the same time, how they went about it, I didn't think was really great ... We were like, Okay, you guys went rogue and changed the format and didn't tell anybody. Did you get their input about how it could be better? Pegula, who will team up with fellow American Tommy Paul in the competition that also features pairs such as Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu and Jannik Sinner and Emma Navarro, said the move to limit the field could impact doubles players' earnings. "It's not good when you have players saying they're upset that now they can't play, or that it's a way for them to make money and now they don't have that," Pegula added. "It's going to be a really fun event, but at the same time, I wish that they would have been communicating with us a little bit better."</p>

The most controversial change is the limited field of 16 teams—eight direct entries based on singles rankings, not doubles, and eight wild cards, a mix of fan favorites and doubles champions.Pegula, a member of the WTA's Player Council who co-signed a letter to the four Grand Slams calling for a greater share of profits for players, welcomed the initiative but said the lack of communication left players blindsided.Read More: US Open breathes new life into mixed doubles format with Fan Week revamp“We were like, Okay, you guys (US Open) just went rogue and changed the format and didn't tell anybody.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last month at Wimbledon, Coco Gauff was upset in the first round by Dayana Yastremska. Plus, Carlos Alcaraz, Jessica Pegula, and Jasmine Paolini will alsoplay their third round matches. And in a battle between two Masters 1000 champions, Andrey Rublev takes on Alexei Popyrin. Tuesday's play gets underway at 11:00am local time. Rublev's two Masters 1000 titles both came on clay, though he was a finalist four years ago in Cincinnati. Popyrin was the surprise champion last summer in Canada, and also reached the quarterfinals last week, eventually losing a tight match to third-seeded Alexander Zverev. The Australian also achieved a quarterfinal here two years ago, yet this year he's struggled, and owns a losing record. Perhaps no longer having the defense of the Canada points looming over him will free up Alexei's play. Having won their last two matches, I give Alexei the slight edge to prevail again on Tuesday. Dayana Yastremska (32) vs. Coco Gauff (2) – Not Before 3:00pm on Center Court Yet the 2025 champion played well on Sunday, defeating Xinyu Wang 6-3, 6-2, just weeks after the same player upset Coco on grass in Berlin. Yastremska is now 31-17 on the year, and has advanced to a pair of WTA finals, in Linz and Nottingham. Dayana has a pretty big game, but she can also become error-prone at times, and she does not possess the same great movement that Coco has. Prior to their Wimbledon matchup, Gauff has claimed their other three encounters, though she did bizarrely drop the first set to Yastremska this past April in Madrid by a score of 6-0. While the fast-playing conditions in Cincy are to Dayana's liking, I still favor Coco to avenge a recent loss for the second consecutive round. Hamad Medjedovic vs. Carlos Alcaraz (2) – As has been the theme of his season, Alcaraz did not play his best tennis in his opening round on Sunday, yet still managed to beat Damir Dzumhur in three sets. This is his first encounter with Medjedovic, who upset 26th-seeded Tallon Griekspoor in the last round. Jasmine Paolini (7) vs.  Ashlyn Krueger (26) – Paolini defeated Maria Sakkari on Sunday via a pair of sets decided by tiebreaks. Magda Linette (31) vs. Jessica Pegula (4) – Pegula defeated Kimberly Birrell in straights in her opening round, to record just her second victory since the start of Wimbledon. She is 3-0 against Linette, and has claimed all six sets they've contested. Brandon Nakashima (26) vs. Sascha Zverev (3) – Zverev has reached the semifinals or better in his last three Cincinnati appearances, taking the title back in 2021. He has won all four times he's faced Nakashima, though all four matches have been pretty tight.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz will take on Hamad Medjedovic at the Cincinnati Masters on Tuesday. The third-round schedule also includes a showdown between Andrey Rublev and Alexei Popyrin. Carlos Alcaraz hasn't played an event since he lost the Wimbledon final to Jannik Sinner–and it showed in his second-round win over Damir Dzumhur at the Western & Southern Open. Cincinnati will be Alcaraz's only event prior to the U.S. Open in a couple of weeks. Hamad Medjedovic is ranked 72nd in the world. Like Alcaraz, Medjedovic has played no other events since Wimbledon; unlike Alcaraz, he lost in the opening round at the All-England Club. His best results have come on hard courts, but a player of Alcaraz's caliber is going to be a big ask. Despite Alcaraz's slow start to the North American hard-court swing, look for him to advance in straight sets. Andrey Rublev has endured an inconsistent season. 11 won the title in Doha, but his Grand Slam results have been lackluster. Popyrin won their two most recent matches, both in 2024 in Monte Carlo and Montreal. Rublev is a player whose results reflect how much confidence–or lack thereof–he has. He at least made a good run to the quarters last week in Toronto, which bodes well for his form in Cincy. Interestingly, Popyrin also made the quarters in Toronto. He upset Daniil Medvedev and Holger Rune last week, so he will be playing with confidence. With both men in decent enough form, look for this one to go the distance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu complained to the umpire about a crying child and was applauded by sections of the crowd in her narrow third round loss to world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka in Cincinnati. READ MORE: American rap icon to headline AFL grand final day READ MORE: Great urges slumping Pies to make tough calls on veterans READ MORE: 'Can't see him ever playing': Broken trust could end star's career At one point as she stepped up to serve, the 2021 US Open champion stopped her motion when a child cried out. She turned to the umpire and said: "It's been, like, 10 minutes." As Raducanu towelled herself, the umpire said: "I can call in, but we need to continue for the moment." Both players held serve until it went to a tiebreak in the final set, with Sabalenka pulling through to win it 7-5. "Happy to get through this match," Sabalenka said in her on-court interview. Raducanu opened the match by winning eight straight points. but a double fault on the ninth point swung things for Sabalenka, who took the first frame in around an hour. Sabalenka has now won all three career meetings with Raducanu, who has lost 11 of 12 matches against top five players. She's currently working with Francisco Roig, who coached Rafael Nadal from 2005-2022.</p>
