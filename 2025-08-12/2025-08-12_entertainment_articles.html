                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daryl Hall and John Oates have privately resolved the legal dispute involving the very public breakdown in their business partnership, court filings confirm. Given the entry of final judgment in arbitration, plaintiffs will be contemporaneously filing a notice of voluntary dismissal with the court,” lawyers for Hall wrote in a status report filed Monday in Nashville court and obtained by Rolling Stone. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame artists known for their massive Eighties hits “Maneater,” “Private Eyes,” “Kiss on My List,” and “I Can't Go for That (No Can Do),” were no longer on speaking terms as they fought over Oates' right to sell his half of their business partnerhip to Primary Wave, court filings revealed. In a November 2023 declaration to the court, Hall accused Oates of committing the “ultimate partnership betrayal.” He claimed Oates went behind his back, negotiated with Primary Wave in secret, and then “ambushed” him with news he intended to sell his half of their Whole Oats Enterprises partnership, known as WOE, to the music publishing company as Hall was preparing to leave on a tour. In his declaration, Hall said he didn't “agree” with Primary Wave's business model and believed such a sale could cause “unimaginable” harm to WOE's assets, which include the music duo's trademarks, personal name and likeness rights, record royalty income, and social media and website properties. “Over the course of the last several years, there has been a significant shift in John Oates' behavior away from operating in a professional and business-minded manner, particularly as it relates to WOE. “It appears to me that John Oates' intent has become to burden and harass me without regard to my interests as his business partner, or the interests of WOE.” In the 2023 filings previously obtained by Rolling Stone, Hall claimed that he was “deeply troubled” that Oates entered into an agreement with Primary Wave in what he called a breach of their partnership agreement. He claimed Oates was required to get his written approval. “I have no intention of becoming partners with Primary Wave, and the Oates Trust cannot be permitted to thrust a new partner upon me in this outrageous fashion.” In a dueling declaration filed at the same time, Oates said he was “tremendously disappointed” that Hall chose to make such “inflammatory, outlandish, and inaccurate statements about me.” He said their dispute was already part of a private mediation and private arbitration, and Hall was the one causing harm. “I have no idea who or what is motivating Daryl to take these steps and make such salacious statements, but I am deeply hurt,” Oates wrote. Why Did Two Hall & Oates Musicals Mysteriously Fall Apart? Details Emerge in Hall & Oates' Mysterious Legal Battle Oates declined to discuss details of the legal battle when he spoke with Rolling Stone last year about his new solo LP Reunion. But he said his focus shifted in recent years, and that involved a move away from Hall & Oates. “I'll tell you what changed,” he says. “During the pandemic, there were no more private planes. It gave me a chance to step back. My wife and I decided it was time to give back. Asked if there was an official end date that should be added to the Hall & Oates Wikipedia page, he declined to speak for Hall.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Once again, June Squibb is proving that there's no age limit on being a leading lady. But while Eleanor may be bending the truth, her story ends up leading her into a brand new friendship, this time with a young journalism student named Nina (Erin Kellyman) who's dealing with a loss of her own. As Nina delves deeper into Eleanor's (phony) tale of her life as a Holocaust survivor, she also finds a way to re-connect with her grieving, news anchor father (Chiwetel Ejiofor). While Johansson says she's “very proud of it and proud of all the work everybody did to make it,” production was also an emotionally challenging process in a different sense. Luckily, Johansson found her way to Sony Pictures Classics, which she said “saved the day” by “still making original ideas and putting faith in first time directors.” The film went on to premiere at Cannes and will also screen at TIFF this fall. Everyone else will get to experience Squibb's latest turn in theaters September 26.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That line, delivered by a fast-talking and cynical recent college grad (played by Chris Eigeman, who mastered such roles in the '90s) is one of many memorable bits of dialogue in Kicking And Screaming, writer-director Noah Baumbach's first film. Baumbach's father and mother, like the ones in this movie, were both writers who split up, and the director grew up in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where Squid was largely filmed. But it is nostalgic, with cinematographer (and frequent collaborator of Wes Anderson,who produced the film) Robert Yeoman giving the neighborhood—parts of which, to be fair, can be awfully photogenic in real life—a warm, retro glow, its leafy streetscapes being the kind you'd love to walk down on a sunny spring day to the sounds of a Bert Jansch song and its central family's brownstone living room lined with books and cloaked in soft, amber lighting. It's a movie that looks back simultaneously fondly and painfully. The Squid And The Whale was shot on 16-millimeter film to capture those sensations and 1986 Brooklyn (much like how Todd Haynes' Carol would recreate 1950s New York City a decade later). “I wanted to give the film an authentic 1980s feel. “Super 16 also feels lived-in, instantly looks like an older film. I wanted to handhold the movie, but steadily, so you detect only a hint of movement. It did: The Squid And The Whale is lean and mean—its runtime is a tight, glorious 81 minutes, and emotional scenes that could have played out longer cut quickly to the next ones so as not to lose momentum. It's also very intimate, both in its storytelling scope and its aesthetic, with a filmmaking style that had a “raw feel,” as Baumbach put it to The A.V. Club‘s Noel Murray, that was inspired by “French New Wave movies, and John Cassavetes and early Martin Scorsese.” And the film's verisimilitude—the quick shots of a bodega counter or a subway stop in Flatbush, say, or the very Park Slope-y bathroom radiator and tiling, or the constant search for a parking spot—heightens the sense of place and help you immediately understand it, even if you've never set foot in Brooklyn. “The brownstone we used belonged to my childhood friend Ben and his wife Molly,” Baumbach told IndieWire. “They were really generous to let us transform their place and relocate while we filmed. Shooting in places that had real meaning to me helped me connect with the material on both a visceral and creative level. And I put Jeff [Daniels] in my dad's clothes.” Bernard and his wife, Joan —played by Laura Linney, who gives arguably the best performance in the film, flitting between a sweet motherly voice to calling her kid “a shit” to breaking into laughter because her character, whose writing career is on the upswing while Bernard's is stalled, is too exhausted to argue—have decided to separate. Their two children, 16-year-old Walt and 12-year-old Frank (Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline, respectively, with the former tackling, presumably, a young Baumbach surrogate), handle the news differently. If some of the Frank stuff sounds particularly left-field or even envelope-pushing for a comedic drama that is, ultimately, an empathetic portrait of a divorce and the people it hurts, it is—and it's not the only instance. He and Walt even get into an odd sort of love triangle with one of Bernard's writing students, the lively, 20-year-old Lili (a great Anna Paquin) that calls to mind the one at the center of Squid producer Wes Anderson's Rushmore. I mean, exhibiting her cunt in that fashion is very racy. I mean, Lili hails her influences in postmodern literature, a bit derivative of Kafka. Did you get that it was her cunt?” (The fact that you end up caring for Bernard in the end is one of Squid‘s greatest achievements.) A Filmmaker piece from 2007, when the director was promoting his follow-up to Squid, Margot At The Wedding, tidily summed up that stretch: “After his second film, Mr. Jealousy (1997), Baumbach admits that he got “derailed” and ended up making Highball (1997) pseudonymously then scripted a TV movie, Thirty (2000), neither of which he considers to be his best work. However, his career was re-energized by his association with Wes Anderson: He brought Baumbach on board to co-write The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004), and then produced Baumbach's triumphant The Squid And The Whale (2005).” Murray assessed his pre-Zissou period even more bluntly: “Baumbach fell off the radar.” It's hard to imagine the Noah Baumbach we know now—the co-scribe of a billion-dollar phenom, who will release a film starring George Clooney, Adam Sandler, and Laura Dern this November as one of the rare writer-directors who can seemingly make whatever he wants these days—without The Squid And The Whale putting him back on that radar. But beyond the machinations of finally getting a passion project off the ground, Squid is a notable step up from what Baumbach had done before. Who doesn't just want to stay at college and ignore the real world for another year after graduating? Mr. Jealousy is also enjoyable as a Woody Allenish, talky comedy starring Kicking vet Eric Stoltz and The Sopranos‘ Annabella Sciorra. (“I do think that I in some ways trusted my own voice as a filmmaker more on this one,” he said in that A.V. One of the running jokes of The Squid And The Whale is that Walt pretends that he penned Pink Floyd's “Hey You.” He ends up winning the talent show for his performance (“I'm going to play lead guitar and do vocals on a song…I wrote,” he says), only to have his trophy taken away when it's discovered that it was actually an incredibly popular track by Pink fucking Floyd. Ken Leung's school therapist presses him on why he lied. “I felt I could have written it, so the fact that it was already written was kind of a technicality,” Walt replies, quickly and defensively. In Squid, you get little glimpses of a smart, impressive teen (though not as smart and impressive as he let on) who would make a film, 19 years later as an adult, that'd finally win those trophies, give him the shot of confidence he needed to reenergize his career, and—most importantly—happen to be really goddamn good (or, to mangle a quote from Bernard, “the fillet of the genre”).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The pop star fittingly announced her 12 studio album on Aug. 12. Taylor Swift didn't rest for long after wrapping her global Eras Tour. “So, I wanted to show you something,” she said in the video, pulling a blurred-out vinyl from a “T.S.” brief case as the Kansas City Chiefs tight end beamed beside her. “This is my brand new album, The Life of a Showgirl.” Fans are now clamoring for all the information they can get on the LP, which will mark Swift's first full-length since 17-week Billboard 200 chart-topper Tortured Poets. See everything there is to know — so far — about Swift's 12th studio album below. But fans are already starting to come up with theories about what inspired the theatrical name, with some people pointing out that scenes from Gold Diggers of 1933 — a 92-year-old film about showgirls — just so happen to match the aesthetic of her Eras Tour performance of “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived.” “Okay wait I'm already obsessed with this album concept,” one fan wrote on X. For months, Swifties speculated that her incorporation of more and more orange outfits in the final stages of the Eras Tour meant that the star's next album would have an orange theme — something that proved to be true when Swift finally announced The Life of a Showgirl, changing her website to have a sparkly clementine wallpaper, and updating her profile pictures on social media to show a similarly hued lock. Taylor Nation had also shared 12 images of Swift wearing orange on stage hours before the album was announced. A second crucial color of the new era, however, appears to be mint green — and fans think they might have already figured out what it represents. “The colour scheme is copper oxidizing because a showgirl is on a pedestal for the world and over time, in the public eye they lose their shine…,” one person wrote on X, using the Statue of Liberty's fade from bronze to green over time as an example. After working almost exclusively with Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner for about eight years, Swift appears to have reunited with producer Max Martin for The Life of a Showgirl. At least, that's what fans have gathered from the mysterious Spotify playlist Swift personally curated for the new era — titled “And baby, that's show business for you” — that includes only songs she made with the elusive Swedish pop pioneer. Their previous collaborations include “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” “Blank Space” and “Shake It Off,” each of which spent multiple weeks at No. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

The Prime Video sci-fi comedy from creator Greg Daniels will debut its final season on Aug. 25.


							By 

	Abbey White


Associate Editor & News Writer


Upload's return promises dark AI, chinchilla life coaches and a love story for the (digital) ages in the new trailer for the Prime Video series' final season. 


	The sci-fi comedy's four-part finale event was previously teased during San Diego Comic-Con with a look at Aleesha's (Zainab Johnson) new life as a spy tasked with infiltrating Horizon, the company in charge of running Lakeview. Now, as part of a new two-minute teaser (below), the Prime Video series picks up where season three left off, revealing the fate of Robbie Amell's two Nathans inside that digital afterlife.

	As a ragged-looking Nora (Andy Allo) discovers her version of Nathan has seemingly succumbed to deletion and somehow returned as a digital ghost, she sets out to not only convince the others that he's alive, but to save and reunite with him. 


	Meanwhile, Ingrid (Allegra Edwards) and her Nathan navigate the unique challenges of a virtual relationship, alongside Nathan and Luke (Kevin Bigley) affirming their friendship as the rest of Lakeview faces new threats. That includes ownership focused on increasing monetization, a tall, dark and threatening AI Guy (Owen Daniels), and the potential full-blown destruction of Lakeview with everyone inside. 


	The four-part finale event promises one final battle as a new sentient evil AI threatens to wipe out the world, testing the series' core ensemble — Nathan, Nora, Ingrid, Aleesha, Luke and AI Guy — like never before. 


	Created by Greg Daniels, who also serves as executive producer along with Howard Klein and Maxwell Vivian, Upload's fourth and final season will premiere on Aug. 25.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, The Life of a Showgirl, the forthcoming 12th studio album from Taylor Swift, has drenched their reality in screaming color — shades of orange and teal, to be exact. The hints and easter eggs that could have passed for symptoms of psychosis before might have been real all along. Goodnight showgirls I'll see you for more psychosis tomorrow pic.twitter.com/7R2bXy3sOL “It's so fun to be a fan of the zodiac killer in pop star form,” a Swiftie named Lacey wrote on X a few hours before the official announcement of the new album arrived at 12:12 a.m. EST on Tuesday. They don't even know how long they have to go before Swift releases the album, or even unveils the first single. “A Taylor Swift announcement followed by a 48-hour wait for the cover & release date should actually be considered psychological warfare,” Swiftie Josefina said on X. the album title gives me such bejeweled energy idk why ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥#THELIFEOFASHOWGIRL pic.twitter.com/Wsc5f6FQw7 More hints were apparently hidden in the Eras Tour. In the “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” video, captured during the tour, fans realized that Swift rehearsed with orange burlesque feather fans. “SWIFTIES I JUST REALIZED ANOTHER INSANE EASTER EGG,” one account, JB, announced on X. “‘Applause' by Lady Gaga – which played in the pre show of every night of the Eras Tour – was released on AUGUST 12TH.” (The song also turns 12 years old today, but surely that could just be a twisted coincidence). Swifties are digging into color theory (likely thing for them to do), too. “The colour scheme is copper oxidizing because a showgirl is on a pedestal for the world and over time,” she said. Fans have pointed out parallels to fictional characters that were showgirls in their own universe — like Lucy Gray Baird in Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, or Carrie Bradshaw when she finds out that Big is moving to Paris. But overnight, Spotify billboards appeared with a code to access a playlist titled “And baby, that's show business for you” full of Swift songs. Coincidentally, all of the songs included were produced by Max Martin. “Does Spotify even have the infrastructure to handle a Taylor Swift Max Martin and Shellbeck release,” one Swiftie asked.

Another added: “Aaron Dessner, we might not meet you at midnight for the album release but I do believe we will meet you at 1 am for some bonus tracks.” “Being the office swiftie is so humiliating, like I have to go to bed knowing I'm in for a whole press junket tomorrow,” one user wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kelce told GQ he loves watching girlfriend Swift perform because she can make a stadium feel like "this little room." Travis Kelce knows all about sacrificing, training and running your body ragged in order to play like a champ on game day. Not for nothing, he also said that as hard as he hits the gym, his girlfriend of two years, Taylor Swift, is just a much of a gym rat when it comes to prep for her shows. “That was very relatable, seeing how exhausted she would get after shows,” he said. “She may not think of herself as an athlete. I've seen the amount of work that she puts on her body, and it's mind-blowing.” Swift famously trained for the show by performing the entire career-spanning set while running on a treadmill, something Kelce said was super intense, even for a dedicated athlete like him. He described the stage for the show as “football-field-sized computer,” one that got “scorching hot” on stops in places like Singapore. “That is arguably more exhausting than how much I put in on a Sunday, and she's doing it three, four, five days in a row.” And while he is a global superstar in his own right now — guest hosting SNL in 2023, appearing in the new Happy Gilmore 2 sequel, hosting his New Heights podcast with brother Jason Kelce and the Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity? Kelce said he is excited to go to Swift's shows and be a fan, because he is a fan. I feel that same enjoyment every time she comes to my shows,” he said of Swift's by-now routine appearances in the family sky box cheering him on during the season. “I sort of made her a football fan,” Kelce told the magazine, which described him as speaking freely about his partner with the “confident adoration of a sturdy relationship,” while noting that his pride is not of the macho or overprotective chivalrous type, but more of the “immaculate,” selfless variety. He also can't get enough of her shows, marveling at the impact Swift has on her followers and the warm pull of her celebrity, a rare gift that can make a 65,000-capacity football stadium feel like a living room. “People gravitate towards how she performs and how she makes it feel like the entire stadium is in this little room with her,” he said. I think that alone — there is so much calm and coolness. As he gears up for the upcoming 2025-2026 football season, Kelce will have plenty more chances to see Swift in the stands, and, maybe, on stage again. The singer surprise announced her 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl, on Tuesday morning (Aug. 12) and while no specifics on the LP have been announced yet, it's possible Swift will reveal some details on Wednesday (Aug. 13) when she makes her first appearance on the New Heights pod.

Co-produced by All in the Family‘s Bud Yorkin, What's Happening!! After a successful four-week run that started in August 1976, the comedy returned in November of that year and then for another two seasons. Spencer played Dee, the smart-aleck younger sister of Roger “Raj” Thomas (Ernest Thomas) and daughter of Mabel (Mabel King), and she became known for her catch phrase, “Ooooh, I'm gonna tell Mama!” Nelson portrayed the down-to-earth Dwayne on the show. Spencer went on to became a veterinarian in 1993, and James L. Brooks hired her to play one in his 1997 film, As Good as It Gets. Born on June 24, 1965, and raised in New York City by her mother, Cheryl, a French teacher, and stepfather, actor Tim Pelt, Danielle Luise Spencer started acting at age 7 in a repertory company co-founded by Pelt. She had uncredited bit parts in such films as Serpico (1973) and Harry and Tonto (1974) before landing the role in What's Happening!! “I had never seen any young black girl in that type of spotlight, so I didn't have a reference point in the media as to how to deal with this opportunity,” she told Jet magazine in 2014. “I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye to my stepfather, Daddy Tim, whom I loved and who taught me show business as a young child in New York,” Spencer wrote in her 2010 memoir, Through the Fire … Journal of a Child Star. was canceled, Spencer and her family moved to the Ivory Coast. She then attended UC Davis, UCLA and then veterinary school at Tuskegee University, earning a doctorate in veterinary medicine in 1993. A decade later, Spencer developed a spinal condition — perhaps caused by her auto accident — that left her paralyzed from the waist down for months. Spencer worked as a veterinarian for two decades in the Los Angeles area before relocating in 2014 to Richmond, where she did a regular morning segment about pet care for CBS affiliate WTVR-TV. In 2014, she was inducted into the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture. In a 2016 interview with Hers magazine, Spencer said it was important to do “what it is that you think is going to make you happy.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Send us a tip using our anonymous form.</p>

Take a look at the newly released trailer for “Task” below. It felt like one of the few cops-and-criminals crime thrillers that actually cared about its victims. Related Stories ‘Only Murders in the Building' Season 5 Trailer: Another Arconia Killing Gives Way to a New York Power Struggle  ‘Griffin in Summer' Trailer: First-Time Director Nicholas Colia Makes Everett Blunck a Breakout Star in Tribeca Winner It's taken four years, but Ingelsby returns with a new series, and “Task” looks to explore other often-neglected aspects of American life. This time, Mark Ruffalo leads an FBI Task Force assigned to solving a string of armed robberies, led by a family man (Tom Pelphrey) who hardly fits the profile of career criminal. Ingelsby's always been interested in life at the margins. His debut spec script, which became the 2013 film “Out of the Furnace,” came to him when he imagined what it would be like to be a criminal recently let out of prison — at the time he was writing it, the then AFI grad student was working a summer job at the famed Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio. Billed right now as a drama series, it'll be interesting to see if “Task” has multi-season potential for HBO. “Mare of Easttown” won multiple Emmys in the limited series categories for the 2020-2021 season, though it lost Best Limited Series to “The Queen's Gambit.” IndieWire is certainly excited about this one.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to real estate records obtained by the US Sun, Blackstock bought his four-bedroom, three-bath ranch in Butte, Montana, in April 2022 for $1.8 million. From the property, Blackstock ran his companies — V Bar V Cattle Co. and Valley View Livestock — and also founded Valley View Rodeo in Bozeman. He was a grandfather to Savannah's son and had another grandchild on the way. Before his retreat to Montana, Blackstock had a high-profile career in the music industry. Working alongside his father, Narvel Blackstock, he managed artists including Blake Shelton and produced for “The Kelly Clarkson Show.” He was also the former stepson of country icon Reba McEntire, maintaining a close relationship with her after her 2015 divorce from Narvel. Clarkson filed for divorce in June 2020, with the split finalized two years later following disputes over property — including her $10 million “Vintage Valley” ranch. After she won the property in court, Blackstock moved to his own Butte ranch. Blackstock's cancer diagnosis remained private until his death on August 7. His family confirmed the news in a statement to CNN: Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. TMZ reported he was fighting melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer, and Page Six noted that he was in hospice care before his passing. A source told Page Six, “It's been exhausting and so sad. Just one day before his death, Clarkson canceled her Las Vegas residency dates to be with their children. “While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them,” she told fans.</p>

A post shared by Lady Diana, Princess of Wales (@lady.diana._) The royal chef further revealed that the palace menu often shifted toward “nursery-friendly” comfort food when William and Harry were home from boarding school. It changed from Princess Diana's healthy eating—stuffed peppers, eggplant, vegetarian dishes—to nursery food,” McGrady said. “Wills and Harry loved cottage pie, pizza, chicken nuggets, French fries, potato wedges, macaroni cheese.” On occasion, the princess was also known to switch things up. McGrady revealed to People that one afternoon, “the princess came in and said, ‘Cancel lunch today. They would get fast food sometimes, just like normal families with children.”</p>
