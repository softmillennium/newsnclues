                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK — Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and wire fraud Tuesday morning, three years after the dramatic $60 billion collapse of the Terra/Luna stablecoin ecosystem. The 33-year old South Korean national arrived in court in handcuffs and a canary yellow prison jumpsuit, a metal chain around his waist. He admitted that he "knowingly engaged in a scheme to defraud and did in fact defraud" purchasers of the TerraUSD  stablecoin. Under the charges in the original indictment, Kwon faced a maximum sentence of 135 years in prison if convicted on all counts. Under the terms of the plea agreement, laid out by an assistant U.S. attorney, Kwon agreed to pay a maximum forfeiture of $19,286,774.78 plus interest, forfeit what Engelmeyer described as a “substantial set” of properties and pay restitution. In exchange, the DOJ agreed to recommend a maximum sentence of 12 years. Once he's served half of his ultimate sentence, the DOJ agreed to support any motion Kwon makes for an international prisoner transfer. Kwon's attorney said there remain open charges against him in South Korea. “Between 2018 and 2022 in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere, I knowingly agreed with others to engage in a scheme to defraud, and did in fact defraud, purchasers of the cryptocurrencies issued by my company, Terraform Labs,” Kwon said. "In 2021, I made false and misleading statements about why [UST] regained its peg," he added, noting that a trading firm had been involved. Kwon had repeatedly and publicly cheered on UST, criticizing detractors or anyone who questioned the token's stability. "Have fun staying poor," he tweeted at one user on X in 2021. Throughout the hearing, the judge asked a number of procedural questions to establish that Kwon was competent to plead guilty, running briefly through his medical history and checking at multiple points that Kwon had read the filings he was agreeing to and discussed them with his legal team. Kwon will be sentenced on Dec. 11 at 11:00 a.m. in Manhattan. By the time of his sentencing, he will have been in U.S. custody for almost a year. He and Terraform Labs had already been found liable for civil fraud by a jury in a case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, following UST's collapse. UPDATE (August 12, 2025, 16:42 UTC): Adds details from the hearing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even though the PUMP token jumped to roughly $0.0068 soon after its listing, whales were quick to cash out, provoking a nearly 67% decline in the token's value. But continued sell-offs by large holders have capped bullish momentum. While PUMP is still constrained by whale dominance, opportunistic traders are already looking for new cryptocurrencies with higher potential. One standout project on their lists is Snorter Token (SNORT), the native token of a Solana-based trading bot that will power lightning-fast trades and snipes through a Telegram interface. Early investor interest has already helped the token raise more than $3 million in its recently launched presale, with some predicting that it could become one of the biggest crypto launches of 2025. Meme coin enthusiasts are closely watching PUMP's next swing, as many see it as an important factor in determining if Solana's meme coin frenzy is still going strong. After sliding from roughly $0.007 to an all-time low of $0.0022 on July 29, the PUMP token took a bullish stance and has been climbing within a rising wedge ever since. We're witnessing a series of higher lows and slightly shallower higher highs, indicating that buyers are still in control, but are losing a bit of momentum with each push. Pump.fun has reclaimed its position as Solana's top meme coin launchpad, hosting more than 65% of 27,500 daily launches. This increased platform activity directly correlates with the demand for PUMP tokens, as creators and traders use the token to cover fees and participate in incentives. What's worth noting is that even with platform metrics flashing green, some heavyweight traders are already heading for the exits. Whale investor @ParallelAiRev just closed all his $PUMP longs, taking profits at highs. From a fundamental point of view, Pump.fun has spent about 118,000 SOL (roughly $19 million) buying back almost three billion PUMP tokens at $0.0064 each. But PUMP is still down 53% over the past month, suggesting that organic demand remains relatively low. Given the headwinds PUMP is facing, many traders are scouting new presales for higher upside, and Snorter Token is quickly moving to the top of that list. Snorter Bot is an automated Web3 trading solution on Telegram that will use Solana tech for higher speed and efficiency. Its goal is to help everyday users spot and act on emerging token opportunities, helping them find the next 100x gem before it goes mainstream. To accomplish this, Snorter Bot comes equipped with advanced features that were previously reserved for professional trading tools. More importantly, the bot will also feature scam detection and honeypot filters to automatically flag suspicious contracts or potential rug pulls before any new token purchases are made. For example, the tokens will unlock reduced trading fees as low as 0.85% per trade (versus 1.5% for non-holders) and provide access to premium bot features, including unlimited snipes. Looking at SNORT's potential, popular market commentator ClayBro is bullish on the token's future. In his latest video, he shows us how Google's Gemini predicts SNORT could jump toward $1 by year-end and push past $2 during the next bull run peak in 2025–26. Interested buyers can visit Snorter Token's official website to buy SNORT for a discounted presale price. They can also immediately stake SNORT for a high passive yield of up to 146% annually.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BitMine Immersion Technology (BMNR) shares surged in pre-market trading after the crypto treasury firm announced plans to raise as much as $20 billion to buy more Ethereum (ETH-USD). The company, led by Fundstrat co-founder Thomas Lee, already holds nearly $5 billion in ETH as of Aug. 10. Its long-term goal is to acquire 5% of the entire ETH supply, a stash worth roughly $25 billion at today's prices. The firm previously authorized $4.5 billion in stock sales through deals with Cantor Fitzgerald and ThinkEquity, nearly exhausting that allocation. Now it is dramatically increasing its ambitions with the new $20 billion target. The plan involves continuing to sell shares into a market that has been showing strong appetite for BMNR stock. High trading volumes, averaging $2.2 billion daily last week, mean the company can raise capital with less downward pressure on its share price. BitMine's aggressive buying spree is designed to accumulate and stake ETH, earning yield while competing with other digital asset treasury plays such as SharpLink Gaming (SBET). Its rivals are watching closely since the scale of this buying program could move markets if executed in full. Chairman Tom Lee says BitMine is “leading crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV [net asset value] per share and by the high trading liquidity of our stock.” He sees both as critical advantages as the firm pushes toward its 5% ETH ownership goal. BMNR shares were up over 10% in Tuesday's pre-market trading, building on Friday's near 25% gain. That buying momentum has coincided with ether hitting new cycle highs above $4,300 over the weekend, aided by aggressive accumulation from digital asset treasuries like BitMine. This is a bet that could pay off handsomely if Ethereum's price continues to climb in the next bull cycle. This target implies a potential upside of about 3.48% from the company's most recent close at $57.98.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins - Skynet 1.0 merges AI with blockchain to enhance DeFi/NFT security through real-time threat detection and fraud reduction. - The platform's adaptive AI capabilities could redefine transactional security standards while raising regulatory challenges in crypto-gray jurisdictions. - By integrating predictive analytics with decentralized architecture, Skynet 1.0 may stabilize crypto markets and influence Bitcoin/Ethereum regulation frameworks. - The innovation aligns with enterprise trends prioritizing AI accountability, exemplified by tools like Rubrik's Agent Rewind for error management. Developed by a team of engineers and blockchain experts, the platform integrates AI capabilities with blockchain's core security features to address longstanding challenges in the digital currency ecosystem. This innovation reflects a broader shift toward AI-driven security solutions in the cryptocurrency space [1]. By embedding AI into blockchain infrastructure, Skynet 1.0 introduces a new layer of transaction monitoring and verification. However, the integration of AI into blockchain also raises regulatory concerns, particularly in jurisdictions where cryptocurrency remains a gray area. As the platform expands its reach, it could influence the way cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are traded and regulated. Moreover, the predictive capabilities of AI may lead to more responsive and intelligent blockchain networks, setting a new benchmark for future innovations in the digital transaction space [1]. Companies are increasingly recognizing the need to balance innovation with accountability, particularly as AI becomes more integrated into mission-critical systems. Tools like Rubrik's Agent Rewind, which allows for the reversal of AI-driven errors, highlight the growing emphasis on error management and user control. In a similar vein, Skynet 1.0's approach to real-time threat detection suggests a growing industry focus on both proactive and reactive AI strategies to ensure operational integrity [2]. As AI continues to reshape industries, the ability to combine its strengths with blockchain's decentralized architecture will define the next wave of innovation. The challenge for developers, regulators, and users alike will be to harness these technologies responsibly, ensuring that progress is matched by safeguards that protect both individuals and institutions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Do Kwon, the South Korean cryptocurrency entrepreneur behind two digital currencies that lost an estimated $40 billion in 2022, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to two charges of conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud. Kwon, 33, who co-founded Singapore-based Terraform Labs and developed the TerraUSD and Luna currencies, entered the plea at a court hearing in New York before US District Judge Paul Engelmayer. Accused of misleading investors in 2021 about TerraUSD – a so-called stablecoin designed to maintain a value of $1 – Kwon pleaded guilty to the two counts under an agreement with the Manhattan US Attorney's office, which brought the charges. He faces up to 25 years in prison when Engelmayer sentences him on Dec. 11, though prosecutor Kimberly Ravener said the government had agreed to advocate for a prison term of no more than 12 years provided he accepts responsibility for his crimes. Prosecutors alleged that when TerraUSD slipped below its $1 peg in May 2021, he told investors a computer algorithm known as “Terra Protocol” had restored the coin's value. Instead, they said, he arranged for a high-frequency trading firm to secretly buy millions of dollars of the token to artificially prop up its price. Prosecutors said that false claim and others drove retail and institutional investors to buy Terraform products and boost the value of Luna – a more traditional token that fluctuated in value but was closely linked to TerraUSD – to $50 billion by the spring of 2022. “I made false and misleading statements about why it regained its peg by failing to disclose a trading firm's role in restoring that peg,” Kwon said. Kwon has been detained since his extradition from Montenegro late last year. As part of the deal, prosecutors will not oppose Kwon's potential application to be transferred abroad after serving half his US sentence, Ravener said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon has changed his plea from not guilty to guilty on two counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud. According to reporting on Tuesday from the US District Court in the Southern District of New York (SDNY), Kwon waived his right to go to trial on two of the nine charges he has been facing from the US government and pleaded guilty. The reported plea agreement with prosecutors would impose $19 million in financial penalties. The two felony charges could carry up to a 25-year prison sentence if served consecutively, but the agreement reportedly would have prosecutors not recommend more than 12 years. The Terraform co-founder was indicted in March 2023 for charges including securities fraud, market manipulation, money laundering and wire fraud related to his role at the company. After the 2022 Terra crash, Kwon's whereabouts were largely unknown until Montenegrin authorities arrested him for using falsified travel documents. He served four months in prison before US and South Korean officials both petitioned Montenegro for extradition, which was complicated by challenges in the country's lower courts. Related: Roman Storm conviction for Tornado Cash sets ‘dangerous precedent' It was unclear as of Tuesday why the Terraform co-founder had chosen to change his plea after seven months. Crypto-related figures facing criminal charges in SDNY have not always gotten off easy. Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm was recently found guilty of running an unlicensed money transmitting service and is expected to be sentenced soon, potentially facing a retrial for two charges.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Riva Money raised $3 million in a pre-seed funding round to support the global rollout of its blockchain-powered technology that facilitates global money transfers. Riva was established earlier this year and is now inviting companies to join its waitlist, according to a banner on its website. Riva uses a combination of traditional and blockchain-based payment routing to optimize each payment's speed and cost, according to the press release. Riva powers international payments with blockchain technology, including stablecoins, or with traditional fiat-to-fiat rails, depending on what is the best option for the client's money transfers, based on their location and other circumstances, per the release. “By combining blockchain technology with a robust regulatory framework, we're building a solution that offers businesses the speed, transparency and cost-efficiency they need to thrive in today's interconnected economy,” Riva Money co-founder and CEO Niklas Hoejman said in the release. Malin Posern, partner and managing director at Project A, which led the funding round, said in the release that the time is right for an “infrastructure rethink” because stablecoin adoption is accelerating and regulatory frameworks are maturing. “Riva's dual-rail system for businesses elegantly solves for both speed and flexibility in a market that's still reliant on legacy processes,” Posern said. The PYMNTS Intelligence report “The Treasury Management Playbook: Spotlight on Cross-Border Payments” found that cross-border payments are undergoing a revolution as new solutions deliver cost-effective, real-time payment options with maximum visibility for senders and receivers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) stock popped as much as 5% at the opening bell on Tuesday after ethereum (ETH-USD) rose another 5% to trade north of $4,400 and the company announced plans to sell up to another $20 billion worth of stock to increase its holdings of the cryptocurrency. Bitmine, whose board is led by investor Tom Lee, announced Monday that its holdings of ETH stood at $4.96 billion, or a little over 1.15 million tokens, meaning the company owns roughly 1% of all tokens in circulation. "We are leading crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of our stock," Tom Lee said in a press release announcing the company's latest ethereum purchase. Another major ETH market holder alongside Bitmine, cryptocurrency broker Coinbase (COIN), saw shares up more than 2% in premarket trading on Tuesday. Coinbase operates one of the largest transaction-processing chains on ethereum and holds on its balance sheet more than 100,000 tokens, valued at more than $500 million, according to trade publication Coindesk. The crypto treasury strategy has attracted a variety of companies, including perennial meme stock GameStop (GME), which announced in March its intent to hold bitcoin on its balance sheet, and ETH treasury holder SharpLink Gaming (SBET). The cryptocurrency has yet to crest its high-water mark of more than $4,600, which it attained in October 2021. Ether received a boon in June with the highly successful IPO of fintech giant Circle Internet Group (CRCL), which offers the stablecoin USD Coin. The ethereum network has also gained widespread recognition as the ecosystem of choice for most stablecoin mintings, according to Coindesk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Solana Meme Coins Slump as Investors Rotate into ETH & ‘Quality-Focused' Altcoins Meanwhile, it's been a great month for Ethereum, up 4.7% on the day per CoinGecko data. “The ETH ecosystem, DeFi, and higher-beta L1s have generally held up better than meme-coins. SOL continues to lag, with competitors questioning its narrative,” Max Shannon, senior associate at crypto index provider Bitwise, told Decrypt. Ethereum ETFs and strategic reserves now account for almost 8% of ETH's total supply. “Our institutional clients are becoming increasingly fundamental-discerning and quality-focused,” Shannon explained. “The emerging narrative is ETH as the backbone for institutional capital moving on-chain: Ethereum combines a long operating history, zero downtime, and leading decentralization and liquidity.” “Solana meme coins are down and marking one of the sharpest sector declines, while higher-liquidity altcoins are drawing flows,” Jamie Elkaleh, Chief Marketing Officer at Bitget Wallet, told Decrypt. Elkaleh added that the pattern “points to a clear capital shift: traders are trimming exposure to the highest-beta, thin-liquidity bets and reallocating into deeper markets with stronger narratives and institutional participation, especially ahead of macro events like the U.S. CPI print.” That said, volume in the Solana trenches saw a steady increase over the past seven days, according to Dune data, spiking to $235 million in daily volume across token launchpads on Monday. The increase has occurred amid a battle for market share between token launchpads, with Pump.fun reclaiming its crown on Wednesday. “Although memecoins remain the most actively traded assets on Solana DEXs, their share has recently dropped to 44% from a mid-July peak of 73%,” Illia Otychenko, Lead Analyst at crypto exchange CEX.IO, told Decrypt.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Markets are on high alert ahead of US inflation data set to be released on Tuesday, which could set the stage for crypto's next rally. That's according to Alice Liu, head of research at CoinMarketCap, who said that the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, could “lock in expectations for a September Fed rate cut, which is generally bullish risk-on assets like crypto.” Low rates usually incentivises investors to tap into riskier bets like digital assets. The CPI figures “could potentially trigger Bitcoin's next all-time high,” Liu said in comments shared with DL News. A lower CPI figure could solidify expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September while a hotter inflation read may hit Fed rate cut chances and weigh on crypto markets. The new numbers are “poised to be one of the most critical macro data releases in recent memory for risk assets,” analysts at Presto Labs wrote in a Tuesday note to investors. Several analysts have said they anticipate that crypto prices will soon hit record highs. Even so, Liu notes that Bitcoin and Ethereum options trades have surged to “near yearly highs” of $43 billion and $14 billion respectively. “This high open interest from derivatives traders could amplify volatility, so be cautious of short squeezes, sudden liquidations, or sharp price moves,” Liu said. The Fed has held its benchmark rate at 4.25%–4.50% all year. Markets are pricing an 84.4% chance of a September cut, according to the CME FedWatch tool.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This payments-optimized chain would fill a critical gap in Stripe's crypto stack, complementing its recent acquisitions of stablecoin startup Bridge and wallet infrastructure provider Privy. Stablecoins promise to make crypto mainstream by delivering faster, cheaper, more interconnected global payments. Add the rush to branded rails—Robinhood's chain on Arbitrum, Coinbase's Base on the OP Stack, and now Stripe's Tempo—and we could end up close to where we started, just with block explorers. Worse, market concentration may rise if a few players use stablecoins to reach previously unimaginable scale. We've seen this tension before in the early internet's open web versus walled gardens. Once concentration becomes too high, the ingenuity of entrepreneurs and developers invents a new approach to reverse it. A prominent example is the early internet, which brought a wave of entry and competition to the heavily concentrated industries of telecommunications, retail, and media—only to create the perfect conditions for today's tech giants to scale through network effects and capture a sizable share of value. Although the underlying internet protocols remained open and neutral, massive digital platforms at the application layer walled off participants from competing services by strategically breaking interoperability. From email to social media to payments, we spend most of our time and money within the confines of what the tech giants have designed for us. And while we are clearly better off—more choice, lower prices—it's increasingly clear that some would prefer a world where platforms do not have as much power and influence over them. Crypto's reason for existence was to break free from centralized intermediaries. After the 2008 financial crisis, Satoshi wanted to create a world where anyone could exchange value without having to trust a central bank or financial institution ever again. Inspired by Bitcoin, entrepreneurs and developers have applied the same principles in an attempt to bring decentralization back to other digital platforms—starting with payments, but branching out into finance, marketplaces, messaging, and social media. Overall, progress toward decentralization is mixed: while it's true that Bitcoin allows anyone around the world to be their own bank, the vast majority of consumers and institutions rely heavily on intermediaries for custody and use. Similarly, solutions that offer consumers greater control over their private data and the content they create have stayed niche—often because they lag in usability and convenience relative to the centralized counterparts they're trying to replace. In payments, the most critical battle is unfolding now. Because of winner‑take‑all dynamics, markets can become so concentrated that the public sector has to step in—the most salient example is China's introduction of a central bank digital currency to unravel the payments oligopoly established by Ant Group and Tencent. But as the technology has matured, two core problems have emerged. Libra is the most prominent example: despite backing from more than two dozen leading global companies and countless resources dedicated to establishing credible distributed governance, the project was always perceived as Meta's initiative. Intuitively, distributed ownership of a stablecoin network makes sense and is not that different from what ultimately made Visa scale in the 1970s—when Bank of America relinquished control of the BankAmericard credit card program to respond to increasing competition from the consortium that would become Mastercard. Networks of crypto exchanges and fintechs, such as the Global Dollar Network, may be able to move faster, given the agility of the new entrants backing them, but they will still need to strike the right balance between economic incentives and governance to shift members from a wait‑and‑see mode—where everyone hopes to free‑ride on others' efforts—into action. Even Circle's Centre Consortium, which had only Circle and Coinbase as members, was dissolved and converted into a simple revenue‑sharing agreement. So, while there might be a solution to the decentralized governance of a stablecoin, what we know is that, to date, the only working model is one that places a single entity in charge of everything. This is, of course, problematic in the long term, and while issuers today control only the asset, they have already started expanding their offerings in ways that limit openness. For example, Circle announced its payment network (CPN), which places it at the center of how payments are executed—from defining rules and eligibility, to inserting itself into every API interaction and price and liquidity discovery, to, of course, collecting a fee. Put together, this setup is not that different from the model that has allowed Visa and Mastercard to dominate payments for decades. To date, among networks at scale, that's been true only for the base layers of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. At most, that yields a few thousand decentralized transactions per second globally across all of them combined—a far cry from what global payments would require, even before you layer financial services on top. L2s offer near‑zero fees and instant settlement, and they're profitable because they internalize Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)—the gains from reordering, inserting, or omitting transactions in a block. While crypto purists might decry this trend, it aligns precisely with economic theory: users are willing to pay a premium for decentralization and censorship resistance at the core settlement layer, yet they readily trade some of that for greater centralization in higher layers to gain lower costs and faster speeds. This trade‑off is broader than a user's decision to be their own bank and self‑custody funds versus accepting some degree of trust in a third‑party wallet. Essentially, they are willing to pay for decentralization and neutrality to reduce the risk of hold‑up and expropriation—something that has repeatedly played out on traditional digital platforms. emerged to take advantage of the new economics at play. Because L2s remove friction, offer convenience, and allow builders to deliver experiences much closer to traditional fintech products, they are the obvious layer where most of the value will be created—and appropriated. That's exactly where fintechs, neobanks, crypto exchanges, and even traditional financial institutions have a significant advantage. Based on how strong and persistent network effects have been in crypto over the last decade, it's safe to assume that payments and financial services will disproportionately gravitate toward a couple of leading blockchains. Most activity will take place not on their decentralized base layers but on scaling layers branded and shaped by crypto and fintech players (e.g., Base, Robinhood Chain), applications (e.g., Unichain, World Chain), and financial institutions (e.g., Kinexys, Fnality, Partior). Blockchains drastically lower the cost of verifying and coordinating onchain data, but their value is limited without a strong nexus with complementary offchain information—identity, compliance, credentials, creditworthiness, and more. This is why stablecoin issuers have strong incentives either to commoditize the rails—by issuing on multiple networks and positioning themselves at the center of interoperability across them (e.g., Circle's Cross‑Chain Transfer Protocol)—or to nudge most activity to a network they control, such as a new L2 or a higher‑level protocol like CPN. Either strategy gives them a shot at becoming massive global fintech leaders and capturing most of the value the technology creates. Meanwhile, crypto and fintech players will want to shift those same valuable transactions to a network over which they have more sway, such as a branded L2. In the latter scenario, stablecoins may well be used as a loss leader to expand the reach of a fintech's offering, and domestic stablecoins will be issued to gain more control over the FX market and support local use cases. Real‑world assets (RWAs), memecoins, other tokens, and applications that are truly differentiated and exclusive to those networks may also help these branded chains retain volume within their borders. The same companies will be able to develop clever rewards and loyalty programs that increase consumer and business stickiness within their ecosystems. As convenience and economic reality win over dogmatism, crypto will look very different than it is today. And while that may come with more centralization, the fact that the underlying protocols are open source and forkable means that, no matter how large some players may become, they face more pressure to retain greater interoperability than under the status quo. It is also possible that because crypto protocols allow for new market design and incentives, the ultimate solution will be something that was not quite achievable for the internet protocols—which did not have built‑in monetization mechanisms.</p>
