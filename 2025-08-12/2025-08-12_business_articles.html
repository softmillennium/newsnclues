                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration is still working out the details of its 15% export tax on Nvidia and AMD and could bring deals of this kind to more companies, the White House's Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday. "Right now it stands with these two companies. "The legality of it, the mechanics of it, is still being ironed out by the Department of Commerce, and I would defer you to them for any further details on how it will actually be implemented," she continued. President Donald Trump confirmed on Monday that he had negotiated a deal with Nvidia in which the U.S. government approves export licenses for the China-specific H20 AI chip in exchange for a 15% cut of revenue. Advanced Micro Devices also got licenses approved in exchange for a proportion of its China sales, the White House confirmed. "We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets," Nvidia said in a statement this week. Trump said the export licenses for AMD and Nvidia were a done deal. But lawyers and experts who follow trade have warned that Trump's deal may be complicated because of existing laws that regulate how the government can charge fees for export licenses. The Commerce Department didn't immediately return a request for comment. Earlier this year, Nvidia said that it was on track to sell more than $8 billion worth of H20 chips in a single quarter before the Trump administration in April said that it would require a license to export the chip. Trump signaled in July that he was likely to approve export licenses for the chip after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang visited the White House. The U.S. regulates AI chips like those made by Nvidia for national security reasons, saying that they could be used by the Chinese government to leapfrog U.S. capabilities in AI, or they could be used by the Chinese military or linked groups. The Chinese government has been encouraging local companies in recent weeks to avoid using Nvidia's H20 chips for any government or national security-related work, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's a new company at the center of the intensifying battle between Elon Musk and Sam Altman: Apple. Musk and Altman, who helped start OpenAI a decade ago with a group of other co-founders, had a public falling out that led to a legal fight last year, with Musk accusing Altman of breach of contract for abandoning the artificial intelligence company's founding mission. The back-and-forth war of words and lawsuits took another dramatic turn on Monday, when Musk threatened Apple with "immediate" legal action over alleged antitrust violations. Musk's complaint, which he voiced on his social media site X, is that Apple favors OpenAI's ChatGPT over X's Grok chatbot in the App Store. "Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation," Musk wrote, without citing evidence. Apple partnered with OpenAI in mid-2024 to integrate ChatGPT into its iPhone, iPad, Mac laptop and desktop products. Readers added context to Musk's post, pointing out that China's DeepSeek reached the top spot in the App Store in January of this year, and that Perplexity was No. "This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like," Altman wrote in a post on X Monday night. Altman referenced a 2023 report from tech news site Platformer that described how Musk, after acquiring Twitter (now X), made sweeping platform changes and "created a special system for showing you all his tweets first." Altman said that if Musk ended up filing a suit, he hoped it would lead to "counter-discovery on this," adding that he and many others "would love to know what's been happening." "You got 3M views on your bulls--- post, you liar, far more than I've received on many of mine, despite me having 50 times your follower count!" Musk's X account indicates he has 224 million followers, but the company has never disclosed how many could be bots. Altman clapped back, asking if Musk would "sign an affidavit that you have never directed changes to the X algorithm in a way that has hurt your competitors" or helped his own companies, and said he would offer a personal apology in return. Neither Musk nor his attorneys responded to requests for comment. OpenAI referred CNBC to Altman's posts and the company's past statements. As part of his lawsuit against OpenAI, Musk asked a federal court to stop the AI startup from converting into a fully for-profit business. Musk argued that OpenAI ditched its original mission as a nonprofit to develop AI "for the benefit of humanity broadly." A federal judge in California denied Musk's effort to halt the transformation. OpenAI has emerged as a massive commercial enterprise since the public launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, and is now in talks with investors about a stock sale that would value the company at roughly $500 billion, CNBC confirmed last week. Musk formed xAI in March 2023, announcing its debut four months later. Since then, he has raised billions of dollars for the company, merged it with X and called for Tesla, his only publicly traded business, to invest billions more into the AI company. Altman responded on X, saying, "no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want." Musk took issue with ChatGPT being listed as one of the store's "Must-Have Apps," a list that does not include Grok. "Why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your 'Must Have' section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps? Grok releases have been riddled with safety issues and concerns surrounding manipulation of the technology. In July, Grok responses across X included praise for Adolf Hitler. Musk's threats to Apple come as the iPhone maker faces pressure from regulators and competitors over App Store policies. A panel of judges in June denied Apple's emergency application to halt changes to its App Store that resulted from the company's legal battle with Epic Games. In 2021, a judge ruled that Apple could no longer prohibit developers from directing users away from the company's in-app purchasing, which brings with it up to 30% of gross sales.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has made an unsolicited $34.5 billion bid for Google's Chrome browser, CNBC confirmed on Tuesday. That figure is higher than Perplexity's current valuation, but the company said several investors have agreed to back the deal. In July, Perplexity was valued at $18 billion as part of an extension that valued the company at $14 billion months earlier. Google did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Perplexity is best known for its AI-powered search engine that gives users simple answers to questions and links out to the original source material on the web. Last month, it launched its own AI-powered browser called Comet. The startup is in the middle of a battle for supremacy in generative AI, with companies including Meta and OpenAI offering massive salaries and signing bonuses to top engineers. Megacap tech companies are spending tens of billions of dollars a year on AI infrastructure to build large language models and run hefty workloads, while startups are raising billions of dollars from venture investors, hedge funds and tech giants to pay for the hardware and headcount needed to compete. Perplexity was approached by Meta earlier this year about a potential acquisition, but the companies did not finalize a deal. The judge in the case ruled that Google has held an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search. In response, Google said the DOJ was pushing "a radical interventionist agenda," and that the agency's proposal was "wildly overbroad." Chrome, which Google launched in 2008, provides the search giant with data it then uses for targeting ads. Perplexity's bid for Chrome is not the first time it's taken a big swing. TikTok's future in the U.S. has been uncertain since 2024, when Congress passed a bill that would ban the platform unless its Chinese owner, ByteDance, divested from it. As of August, Perplexity's proposed structure has not materialized.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to allow a "major lawsuit" against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to proceed, escalating his pressure on the central bank leader to cut interest rates. Trump said in a Truth Social post that the suit would relate to Powell's management of pricey renovations at the Fed's headquarters in Washington, D.C., which the president has previously criticized. Trump did not say when that suit could be filed or by whom. "Steve 'Manouychin' really gave me a 'beauty'when he pushed this loser," Trump wrote, referring to his first-term Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin having encouraged him to nominate Powell as Fed chair in 2017. "The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable. Fortunately, the economy is sooo good that we've blown through Powell and the complacent Board," Trump claimed. "I am, though, considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed because of the horrible, and grossly incompetent, job he has done in managing the construction of the Fed Buildings." The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the president's post. The Fed declined to comment on Trump's post. Powell pushed back on Trump to his face last month when the president visited the construction site and claimed that renovation costs had topped $3.1 billion. "I haven't heard that from anybody," Powell said then. Trump has railed against Powell for months as he pressured the central bank to quickly slash interest rates by multiple percentage points. Trump claims that doing so would save the United States vast sums of money by reducing the cost of borrowing to finance government operations. But it has kept rates steady throughout 2025 so far, defying Trump's demands. In congressional testimony in July, Powell said the Fed would have already cut rates this year if Trump had not implemented his major tariff policy. Fed officials in June indicated they expect two rate cuts this year. Traders currently anticipate a quarter-point rate reduction following the Federal Open Market Committee's September meeting. Expectations have risen for further cuts after FOMC meetings in October and December. — CNBC's Erin Doherty contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's the latest example of how major artificial intelligence companies have been looking to deepen their ties to policymakers and regulators in recent months. Anthropic's competitor OpenAI announced earlier this month it will give its ChatGPT Enterprise product to U.S. federal agencies for $1 through the next year. Anthropic said it partnered with the U.S. General Services Administration to bring its technology to participating agencies in the executive, legislative and judicial branches. The company is also offering technical support to help agencies implement its AI. "America's AI leadership requires that our government institutions have access to the most capable, secure AI tools available," Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a statement. In June, Anthropic released a set of Claude Gov models that were built exclusively for U.S. national security customers. The following month, the U.S. Department of Defense announced contract awards of up to $200 million for AI development at Anthropic, Google, OpenAI and Elon Musk's xAI. That same day, xAI announced Grok for Government, which is a suite of products that make the company's models available to U.S. government customers. OpenAI is planning to open its first office in Washington, D.C., early next year, and it launched a new offering called OpenAI for Government in June.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla is recruiting test drivers in New York to operate cars with "automated driving systems," but the company hasn't applied for the permits it would need to test autonomous vehicles in the nation's largest city. A job opening on Tesla's website says the company is looking to hire vehicle operators in the borough of Queens. A spokesperson for the New York City Department of Transportation told CNBC on Monday that Tesla has not applied for approvals to test AVs on city streets in New York. InsideEVs, an electric vehicles news site, previously reported that Tesla was hiring test drivers for its robotaxis in Brooklyn. Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. Alphabet's Waymo, the robotaxi leader in North America, has applied to test its AVs in New York, but its application remains under review, the DOT said Monday. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been trying to sell investors on a future for his company that's built around AI and robotics, rather than sales of its existing vehicles. Tesla's EV sales have been on the decline this year, especially in Europe, partly due to Musk's decision to focus on the Cybertruck, rather than producing a more affordable EV with mainstream appeal. Along with its recruiting efforts in Queens, Tesla is also seeking to hire test drivers for its Autopilot team to gather data from drives in cities and suburbs of Dallas, Houston, Tampa, Orlando and Miami, as well as Palo Alto, California, home to Tesla's engineering headquarters. The current listings on Tesla's website say Autopilot vehicle operators may need to travel to international and domestic destinations and must be familiar with "automated driving systems," suggesting planned or ongoing testing of Tesla's robotaxi and FSD or Full Self Driving system, currently marketed as FSD Unsupervised in the U.S. The Tesla Robotaxi LLC permit and state regulations do not require Tesla to keep a human safety driver on board. However, Tesla has been operating a fleet of robotaxis in Austin since late June, with employees riding in the front passenger seat, tasked with manually intervening during a trip if necessary. The service has only been accessible to invited users. In San Francisco, Tesla is also operating a limited, manned car service but promoting it as "autonomous ride-hailing." Musk posted last week that the company is "working as quickly as possible to get 100+ Teslas operating for autonomous ride-hailing (can't use the word "taxi" or "cab" in California) in the Bay Area and allow anyone to request a ride." Tesla's approach to AVs has drawn federal probes, product liability lawsuits and recalls following injurious or damaging collisions that occurred while drivers were using the company's Autopilot or FSD systems. The California DMV previously sued Tesla, accusing it of false advertising around its driver assistance systems. While Tesla owners manuals say the Autopilot and FSD features in their cars are "hands on" systems that require a driver ready to steer or brake at any time, Tesla and Musk have shared statements through the years saying that a Tesla can "drive itself."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin is not actually interested in negotiating when he meets his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump to discuss the war in Ukraine, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told CNBC on Tuesday. European officials and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have expressed concerns at being sidelined from the Putin-Trump meeting in Alaska on Friday. The Ukrainian leader warned that Russia is planning further offensives and cannot be trusted, while European leaders have been scrambling to secure Ukraine a seat at the table. "Putin doesn't want Zelenskyy around that table, because that would reveal that he actually doesn't want to negotiate, and he just wants to have a picture with President Trump and also postpone sanctions," she said. European officials and Zelenskyy have been sidelined from the Putin-Trump meeting in Alaska on Friday, which has caused much irritation. Zelenskyy has warned that Russia is planning further offensives and cannot be trusted, while European leaders have been scrambling to try and influence Trump and get Ukraine a seat at the table. European leaders, including Zelenskyy, are set to meet for a virtual summit later on Tuesday, which will reportedly focus on ways to pressure Russia, the fate of Ukrainian territories seized by Russia and possible security guarantees for Kyiv. U.S. has threatened, but not yet implemented sanctions on Russia. European officials have long been trying to pressure Washington D.C. to implement measures, which could put pressure on Putin. Ahead of the talks between Trump and Putin, concerns have also grown that the U.S. president may pursue a solution that would be unfavourable for Ukraine. Trump suggested on Monday that there could "some swapping" of territory as part of a peace deal though he insisted the U.S. "would try to get some of that territory back for Ukraine." The EU's Kallas on Tuesday said no deal could be implemented behind Ukraine's back. When asked about how the EU could react should Trump agree to cede some Ukrainian territory to Russia, she said: "How would that work in practice, like really, if Ukraine doesn't agree to this, then how would it really work?" Putin clearly just wants concessions, she said, adding that before any talks about ceding territory, a ceasefire should be discussed. "Just to recall that Ukraine agreed to unconditional ceasefire already five months ago, and since then, Putin and Kremlin, Russia has just been playing games," Kallas said. Hungary, which has previously created hurdles for the approval of EU sanctions against Russia, this week chose not to endorse a statement by the bloc that said Ukraine must be free to decide its own future. "We definitely also need to discuss our working methods, because this is a crucial time for Europe, it is a crucial time for our security, and we need to be able to adopt decisions. We have been able to adopt decisions so far, but it's of course, increasingly more difficult," Kallas said. — CNBC's Holly Ellyatt and Silvia Amaro contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spirit Airlines has warned it might not be able to survive as a going concern if it doesn't raise more cash, five months after the budget travel icon emerged from bankruptcy. After cutting its debt during restructuring, Spirit has tried to attract bookings by marketing more upscale products and looking for new ways to lower costs. Late last month, the airline announced plans to furlough 270 more pilots this fall. "However, the Company has continued to be affected by adverse market conditions, including elevated domestic capacity and continued weak demand for domestic leisure travel in the second quarter of 2025, resulting in a challenging pricing environment," the company said in its quarterly report late Monday. As its financial results aren't improving at the same pace creditors agreements require, Spirit will need additional cash. Failing to do so could result in defaults. The carrier is looking at selling some aircraft, real estate or airport gates, it said. Spirit's bankruptcy last year marked the first for a major U.S. airline since 2011. Known for its bright yellow planes, Spirit was a budget airline pioneer in the U.S., but struggled in the wake of a failed acquisition by JetBlue Airways last year, shifting consumer tastes to more upmarket products and an engine recall that grounded many of its airplanes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk has a bone to pick with Apple. In a series of tweets late Monday night, Musk said xAI would take legal action against Apple for what he says is its bias toward OpenAI on the App Store. "Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation," Musk wrote in an X post. In a post earlier on Monday, he asked why the App Store hadn't placed X higher in its rankings. Inquiring minds want to know," Musk wrote. xAI and Apple didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. At press time, OpenAI's ChatGPT is ranked first on the App Store. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Musk's threats on Monday. "This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like," Altman wrote on X. Altman said the ChatGPT maker would remain "focused on making great products." "Apple behaves like it's owned by OpenAI — why?" He was responding to a post containing several screenshots of banners from the App Store featuring ChatGPT. In February 2024, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, accusing it of violating its nonprofit mission when it partnered with Microsoft. He withdrew the lawsuit in June 2024, only to refile it two months later. Musk has previously leveled criticism at Apple and the App Store. Musk said Apple's fee was a "tax on the Internet" and "literally 10 times higher than it should be." After acquiring Twitter in October 2022, Musk accused Apple of censorship and monopolistic practices. "Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. Do they hate free speech in America?" "Apple has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won't tell us why," he wrote in a follow-up post, amid concerns that Musk's loosening of Twitter's content moderation policies could run afoul of Apple's content restrictions. The dispute was resolved after Musk met with Apple CEO Tim Cook. Musk said in an X post on November 30, 2022, that he had a "good conversation" with Cook and that they had "resolved the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store." "Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so," Musk said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Business Insider couldn't independently verify the drone's speed. This is how new STING Shahed drone interceptors are born — now even faster and more powerful 😎🚀 pic.twitter.com/a6aoRsGik2 Ukrainian units are increasingly looking to these low-cost drones, once a novel concept on the battlefield, as a solution against the Iranian-designed Shahed. Russia, which manufactures the Shahed locally, has drastically increased the number of these exploding drones it deploys at a time, pairing them with ballistic missiles to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. New Russian tactics that allow Shaheds to fly higher and faster have also made it more difficult for machine gun squads, a core pillar of air defense for Ukraine, to hit the loitering munitions reliably. With Monday's video announcement, it has now been recorded notching nearly double that speed. The Wild Hornets have said that one interceptor costs $2,500 and that Ukrainian pilots have already used the Sting to destroy roughly 100 Shahed drones. That's still a small contribution against the total volume of Moscow's drone attacks; Russia launched more than 6,000 Shaheds and decoys in July alone. But Ukraine hopes interceptor drones will soon shore up the gap in its air defenses. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced a goal for the country to build 1,000 interceptor drones daily. Kyiv's forces generally report shooting down or disabling between 86 to 89% of Russia's Shaheds, meaning that several hundred still get through a month. The reported interception and disabling rate was 82% in May. Russia, meanwhile, has been pushing drone technology of its own.</p>
