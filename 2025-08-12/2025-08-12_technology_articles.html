                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Upon landing, local officials charged Guo with providing them with “false flight plan information” and landing without authorization. Since then, he has been staying at a military base while he awaits movement on the court case, AP writes. Unlike the exploits of many other influencers, Guo's stunt does seem to have involved a noble goal: the young American wants to become the youngest person to fly to all seven continents, while also collecting donations for childhood cancer research along the way. On Monday,  the charges against Guo were dropped as part of an agreement between his lawyers and Chile's prosecutors, the AP writes. To avoid a trial, the agreement requires that Guo donate $30,000 to a children's cancer foundation within 30 days, the outlet says. Gizmodo reached out to Guo through his Instagram for comment. He subsequently became interested in beating the world record for youngest person to fly to all seven continents. “Unfortunately, my cousin, who is the same age as me, developed stage 4 Hodgkin's lymphoma. As a young man, I watched the disease affect the people closest to me, such as my grandparents and aunts, little by little,” Guo wrote. In order to raise funds for research and international awareness, I decided that by breaking the record, I could get the necessary attention to influence and help as many people as possible who are suffering from the disease.” It's unclear when Guo will be heading back to the U.S. “I remain in Antarctica awaiting approval for my departure flight,” the teen told the Associated Press on Monday. “I sincerely hope they give it to me soon so that I and my plane can continue with my original mission.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After more than 17 years at the company, he departed to launch his own startup. “I was seeing how fast technology was changing, and I felt there are certain ideas that are best explored in the context of a startup,” Petrou told TechCrunch. His ultimate idea was to build Continua, a consumer-facing company that uses AI agents to enhance collaboration and interaction in group chats on SMS, iMessage, and Discord. Continua announced on Tuesday that it has raised an $8 million seed round. The funding was led by GV, with additional participation from Bessemer Ventures Partners and a group of angel investors. When developing Continua, Petrou noticed that people would interact with ChatGPT or another LLM, and then would copy and paste what they learned into their group conversation. “If you and I are planning a trip, or if we're trying to figure out what to have for dinner, or what movie to watch, all of these things can be facilitated by an LLM participating in a group chat with us,” Petrou said. Continua claims its AI agents can reduce group chat chaos by joining conversations and offering helpful information only when it's needed. As the group discusses projects and common plans, Continua can automatically set reminders, launch polls, add calendar invitations, or generate Google documents with checklists and to-do lists. Since most AI models are designed for conversations between a single person and a single assistant, Continua had to fine-tune its technology to understand the dynamics of group chat discussions. Users can invoke Continua when they need its help or tell the agent to “hang back” if it's chiming in too often. While several companies, including Meta and the startup Hey Umai, offer AI agents for conversations, Petrou insists that Continua is most suitable for group interactions. Erik Nordlander, a general partner at GV, said his firm invested in Petrou even before the concept of Continua's group chat AI had fully taken shape. “David is a really brilliant engineer, someone who's been working with AI since before it was the hot thing.” Marina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a moonshot move, AI search engine Perplexity has offered to buy Chrome from Google for $34.5 billion cash in an unsolicited offer, Reuters reported, and Perplexity has confirmed to TechCrunch. Perplexity tells TC the terms of the offer include a commitment to keep Chrome's underlying engine, Chromium, open source and continue to invest in it. Perplexity's offer includes a promise to invest $3 billion into the open source project. This bid comes after the Department of Justice proposed in March that Google be forced to sell Chrome after a judge ruled the tech giant acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search. (Google is also fighting another federal case where the judge ruled it illegally monopolized adtech, and the DOJ is proposing Google be forced to divest two of its adtech products or otherwise break up its ad business.) When the DOJ first proposed that Google divest Chrome, both OpenAI and Perplexity expressed interest in buying it. Given that Chrome is the dominant browser, with 68% marketshare according to Statcounter, if the court rules Chrome must be sold, no doubt others worldwide would want to bid as well. Perplexity has raised about $1.5 billion to date, PitchBook estimates, including an extension round of $100 million raised last month that valued it at $18 billion, Bloomberg reported. And, by the way, last month, Perplexity also reportedly submitted a bid to merge with TikTok. Amplify your reach, spark real connections, and lead the innovation charge.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The UK government has instructed citizens to delete old emails and pictures to help conserve water, following the announcement of a "nationally significant" water shortage. However, the advice isn't up to snuff, as deleting emails and pictures should have no significant effect on water consumption, and might even make it worse for data centers that use certain types of evaporative cooling. Guidance published Tuesday states "the current water shortfall situation in England is now defined as a 'nationally significant incident.'" Five areas of the country are officially in drought, with six more experiencing prolonged dry weather following the six driest months leading up to July since 1976. Measures such as collecting rainwater, fixing a leaky toilet, and using wastewater to water plants, alongside reducing shower times and not watering your lawn, can help reduce water usage. Finally, the article states, "Delete old emails and pictures as data centres require vast amounts of water to cool their systems." As some onlookers have noted, the recommendation rings a little hollow when juxtaposed next to the UK government's commitment to turbocharge growth using AI. Perhaps more pertinently, the advice rings hollow because it's likely not very sensible. Once the data is stored, the storage devices generate very little heat and are often spun down (placed into low- or no-power states) and called upon only when needed. The impact of an individual deleting emails and old photos on data center water usage is likely to be so infinitesimal as to be considered futile. Furthermore, if the data you're deleting to try and save water is stored in a data center outside of the UK, you'll actually end up saving water (or more likely not, as we've discussed) in some other country. So if you're in the UK and looking to save water during this particularly dry spell, probably best to try some of the other options first.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Havium, a Seattle startup that helps people invest in and own single-family rental properties, raised $550,000 in a recent funding round as it continues to evolve its offerings. Since launching in 2016, and being profiled by GeekWire in 2022, Havium has become a full-service platform that handles all of the operational burden associated with single-family rental (SFR) ownership. Havium launched a full cash management service that handles all payment responsibilities — such as mortgage, taxes, insurance, utilities, HOA dues, etc. — for each Havium property, to insulate clients from such obligations post-acquisition. Jamie Nacht said Havium has helped clients acquire about $40 million in rental properties to date and currently manages $25 million under its full-service model. Havium operates in seven Pacific Northwest markets and expects to enter two or three new markets by the end of the year. The startup has raised $590,000 to date, and the new round — funded entirely by angel investors — will fuel continued product development, backend infrastructure improvements, and geographic expansion, according to Nacht.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amid the rise of new AI-powered low code developer tools aimed at hobbyists and non-technical folks, Uno Platform is doubling down on enterprise developers instead. Montreal-based Uno Platform offers a suite of enterprise-grade tools for developers to build cross-platform .NET applications that can be supported on Android, Apple, Linux, and Windows systems. Users code an application once and Uno Platform makes it easy to ship other types of applications from the existing codebase. Uno Platform is not the only app developer tool platform available, but Tanguay thinks it stands out in a market flooded by vibe coding platforms like Lovable and Cursor. Uno Platform just raised a C$3.5 million ($2.54 million) seed funding round co-led by AQC Capital and Desjardins Capital with participation from Scott Hanselman, the vice president of Microsoft's developer community, in addition to other angel investors. The capital will help Uno roll out its premium tooling tier, Uno Platform Studio, and new feature, “Hot Design” which allows developers to pause a running application and change its user interface in real time. After a few years, Nventive started developing the suite of tools that eventually became Uno Platform because the agency was looking for ways to make itself more efficient, Tanguay said. The open source community could help the agency keep up with frequently changing operating systems that were constantly releasing new versions that required Uno Platform to tweak its offerings. “It was really betting on the open source, as a community, to help grow that initiative and bet that others would see the same value in having access to a toolbox like this.” Tanguay was right and the company has more than 300 open source contributors. Nventive decided to fully spin out the tool box and created Uno Platform in 2023. Since then, the company has started working with enterprise customers, including Toyota, Microsoft and TradeZero, among others.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just a week after OpenAI announced it would offer ChatGPT Enterprise to the entire federal executive branch workforce at $1 per year per agency, Anthropic has raised the stakes. The package will be available for one year, says Anthropic. The move comes after OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind were added to the General Services Administration's list of approved AI vendors that can sell their services to civilian federal agencies. “By combining broad accessibility with uncompromising security standards, we're helping ensure AI serves the public interest.” Anthropic, along with OpenAI, xAI, and Google, has been granted up to $200 million by the Department of Defense to leverage AI for national security, but the AI firm clearly hopes to integrate into a broader array of government work, including science research and health services. Anthropic noted in its press release that Claude is already being used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to accelerate scientific discoveries, and also by the District of Columbia Department of Health to help residents access health services in multiple languages. Anthropic says it is able to make such deployments because Claude “meets the government's highest security standards.” Aside from being certified for FedRAMP High, customers can access Claude through their existing secure infrastructure via partnerships with AWS, Google Cloud, and Palantir, giving them more control over their data. Anthropic's multicloud access could give it an edge in the competition with OpenAI, whose current official FedRAMP High offering is tied to Azure Government Cloud only. While Azure is widely adopted in government, some government agencies and security teams might prioritize data sovereignty, infrastructure control, and the operational flexibility a multicloud strategy offers. OpenAI is, however, actively working to reduce its reliance on Azure so it can embrace a more diversified infrastructure approach.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Allen Institute for AI released a new AI robotics system that uses novel approaches to help robots navigate messy real-world environments, while making all of the model's code, data, and training methods publicly available under open-source principles. The system, called MolmoAct, converts 2D images into 3D visualizations, previews its movements before acting, and lets human operators adjust those actions in real time. It differs from existing robotics models that often work as opaque black boxes, trained on proprietary datasets. Ai2 expects the system to be used by robotics researchers, companies, and developers as a foundation for building robots that can operate in unstructured environments such as homes, warehouses, and disaster response scenes. In demos last week at Ai2's new headquarters north of Seattle's Lake Union, researchers showed MolmoAct interpreting natural language commands to direct a robotic arm to pick up household objects, such as cups and plush toys, and move them to specific locations. Ai2's flagship OLMo large language model is a fully transparent alternative to proprietary systems, with openly available training data, code, and model weights, designed to support research and public accountability in AI development. The institute's projects are moving in “one big direction” — toward a unified AI model “that can do reasoning and language, that can understand images, videos, that can control a robot, and that can make sense of space and actions,” said Ranjay Krishna, Ai2's research lead for computer vision, and a University of Washington Allen School assistant professor. MolmoAct builds on AI2's Molmo multimodal AI model — which can understand and describe images — by adding the ability to reason in 3D and direct robot actions.

With premium color, contrast and video processing, the Asus ROG Strix XG32UCWMG is hard to fault. It delivers a gorgeous image for gaming, entertainment and productivity along with solid build quality and slick styling. Glossy screen layer provides enhanced clarity and color saturation Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. A new OLED gaming monitor seems to appear every week, with models ranging from 27 inches and larger, along with ultra wides and even the occasional jumbo screen. Asus has already populated its ROG Swift and Strix lines with these lovelies, and I have here the newest example, the XG32UCWMG. This bracelet-worthy character string refers to a 32-inch 4K panel that runs at 240 Hz, 480 Hz in FHD resolution, and includes FreeSync Premium Pro, G-Sync compatibility, HDR10 with DisplayHDR 400 and wide gamut color. Though it has the same infinite contrast sported by any OLED, this special glass delivers greater clarity. The native refresh rate is 240 Hz in 4K, and you get a dual mode switch for 480 Hz at FHD resolution. If you're a frame rate junkie, it doesn't get much faster unless you go with a smaller LCD panel running at 500 or 540 Hz. This isn't the first dual-mode monitor I've seen, and in the comparison tests, I'll show you three more examples that produce some interesting results. In my tests, it was just a hair less than 100% which is very colorful indeed. Accuracy is there too with no need for calibration. If your needs run to photography and video production, there are optional color space modes available. The full suite of GamePlus options is here with aiming points, sniper mode, timers, frame counter and display alignment marks. The refresh rate switch can be done with two clicks once it's set up in Windows and you can program the joystick clicks to a variety of often-used commands. You also get LED lighting in the back with Asus' cool Lite-Brite ROG logo that lights up in any desired color. Extensive screen care options include a proximity sensor that blanks the screen when the user leaves their desk and logo and border protection along with pixel orbit and panel refresh. The XG32UCWMG arrived packed with crumbly foam in its three component parts. The power supply is a small external brick. One, that glossy layer is a real thing. There are no Quantum Dots here, but honestly, it's hard to tell. This is common with OLEDs, but Asus has managed to get the top and side borders down to just 8mm. The panel is super thin with a component bulge in Asus' classic two-piece design. The panel's minimum thickness is just 5mm with a metal backing. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. It's a cool aesthetic that I've seen on many of the newest ROG displays. It can also coordinate with on-screen action when Display Widget Center is installed. It's an improvement over the very wide and deep leg-style bases from Asus' past. Just above the cable hole, you can see a small protrusion from the screen with a backlit ROG logo. Behind this is a joystick and two control keys. If you'd rather use an arm, a 100mm VESA mount is provided along with a substantial steel bracket; however, no fasteners are included. One side has two HDMI 2.1 and a DisplayPort 1.4 with Display Stream Compression (DSC). The other side has USB 3.2, one up and three downstream ports and a USB-C which can replicate a second DisplayPort. Everything is supported by KVM functions in the OSD where you can bind USB and video ports together to control multiple systems from a single set of peripherals. The XG32UCWMG's OSD will be familiar to any Asus ROG display owner. You'll need to set it up once in Nvidia Control Panel for G-Sync systems or AMD Graphic Control for FreeSyncers. The full suite of GamePlus features is included, with aiming points, six sniper magnifications, timers, stopwatch, frame counter (number or graph) and display alignment marks. GameVisual is Asus' term for picture modes and there are nine in total. The Image menu has luminance control and a Uniform Brightness toggle. For most productivity apps, leaving this on makes the image more consistent and less fatiguing. When it's off, highlights become brighter, up to around 450 nits at maximum brightness. Additionally, OLED Anti-Flicker prevents artifacts from creeping in during rapid frame rate changes. To calibrate, there are color temp presets and a user mode with RGB sliders. You can also pick from five gamma presets and adjust saturation for all six colors. A front-mounted sensor can be engaged to turn the screen off when you leave your desk. The lighting in the back can be controlled with various colors and effects, or you can tweak it with Asus Display Widget Center app. The joystick directions and selector can be programmed for the most-used functions, such as input select or GameVisual. The left button defaults to Frame Rate Boost, which is the easiest way to switch refresh rates between 240 and 480 Hz. Customized Setting lets you save your configurations for later recall. The full color gamut will be used for all content, covering around 100% of DCI-P3. I made one change to the red slider but left gamma on its default setting. For HDR signals, there are four dedicated modes. True Black is the closest to standard but if you want maximum brightness in the highlight zones, choose Gaming HDR. It will peak at around 1,300 nits in a 1% window. Turning on Adjustable HDR gives you access to the brightness and contrast sliders, plus the Uniform Brightness toggle. My first order of business was to set up the Frame Rate Boost, AKA dual refresh operation. I opened Nvidia Control Panel and set the max refresh rate for 4K at 240 Hz, then pressed the button for 480 Hz, then returned to NCP and set the refresh to 480 Hz. This only needs to be done once; then the XG32UCWMG will switch back and forth with two button clicks after a brief delay. I noted that HDR worked fine in either mode. Just pick your mode before loading the game and you'll be fine. The reduced resolution is certainly obvious when going from 138ppi to 69ppi pixel density. But at 220fps in UHD, there is no motion blur or perceptible delay whatsoever. Only a slower video card will benefit from the 480 Hz mode. The XG32UCWMG's glossy front layer provides an obvious optical benefit. The picture is so sharp, I almost cut myself. Highlights are incredibly textural and bright, yet there is perfect balance over the entire dynamic range. I also did not miss the Quantum Dot color. The picture is so good that I can't imagine giving up that glossy screen for 10% more gamut coverage. G-Sync operated perfectly, and I never saw any artifacts, stutter or blur. It really can't get better than this. Response is incredibly fast, and certainly quick enough for the highest levels of competition. On-screen movement almost seemed to anticipate my control inputs. The XG32UCWMG is equally capable as a workday monitor. You won't find better image quality than OLED and this is one of the best. That is by a small margin, as I have yet to review an OLED I didn't love. This monitor does stand out a bit, though, with that glossy screen. I also appreciated the flexibility offered by Uniform Brightness. All OLEDs should have this feature, but many do not. The XG32UCWMG convenience features like GamePlus's aiming points and KVM peripheral management are pluses for sure. Takeaway: The XG32UCWMG is a premium monitor in every respect. Whether you want it for gaming or work or both, it delivers at the highest level of image quality and performance. Christian Eberle is a Contributing Editor for Tom's Hardware US.

Seeing people pecking at their laptop keyboard while they cradle a latte will be a common enough sight at your local Starbucks in the U.S. The Korea Herald reports that “every branch” of Starbucks in the nation has put up signs telling customers that bringing in their desktop PCs, printers, power strips, and even putting up office partitioning, is no longer permitted. Local news reports suggest that the Starbucks customers with a penchant for bringing their home offices into the café are “a small but persistent group of clients.” The signs urge people to make room for their fellow coffee drinkers, and not to abandon their tech clutter at shared tables for long periods. Of course, there's already a local word for these busy coffee shop table hogging folks. The Korea Herald says locals call them ‘cagongjok,' which it explains is a portmanteau word blending the Korean words for ‘café' and ‘study tribe.' We assume the image was originally shared for mirth-making and/or incredulous impact. Not only does this coffee shop visitor have a bulky-looking desktop setup (but where is the system unit? ), but they have also constructed an isolating office pod to reduce distractions. The source report suggests that other Starbucks cagongjoks have been spotted bringing printers, which are typically bulky, as well as power strips to feed their numerous electronics. It is pointed out that using cafés as study and workspaces has also grown quickly in popularity. However, long-staying customers “can be costly for owners,” states the source. It cites an industry research institute that estimates a single coffee only covers 1 hour and 42 minutes of seat time before it becomes unprofitable.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A horrific shooting took place outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's headquarters in Atlanta on Friday. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has not been particularly good at navigating his high-profile position since taking office. His controversial beliefs and his unusual policies have made the bureaucrat a consistent target for criticism, and the events of this weekend proved to be yet another opportunity for Kennedy-related controversy to erupt. Before he did that, however, Kennedy notably posted some pictures from a fishing trip to his personal X account. “Fishing the Kenae with Ninilchik Chief Ivan Encelewski Chairman of the Cook Inlet Tribal Council and Council President Gloria Oneil,” Kennedy posted on Saturday morning. Some 30 minutes later, Kennedy posted a statement to his official account expressing sympathy for the traumatized CDC staff: “We are deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at CDC's Atlanta campus that took the life of officer David Rose,” Kennedy wrote. Fishing the Kenae with Ninilchik Chief Ivan Encelewski Chairman of the Cook Inlet Tribal Council and Council President Gloria Oneil The 1948 photois Ivans grandpa Chief Larry Oskolkoff Sr. with a skiff load of King salmon from a Cook Inlet fish trap. It's worth noting that public figures aren't always personally responsible for the posts on their social media accounts. Gizmodo reached out to the HHS for comment. White is alleged to have been preoccupied with the covid-19 vaccine which, according to MSNBC, he “blamed for his health problems,” an assertion that was previously corroborated by CNN's sources. Several medical organizations recently sued Kennedy over changes he made to the government's vaccination recommendations. When it comes to the recent shooting, NPR has reported that some laid-off CDC employees have even said that “Kennedy shares responsibility for the violence and should resign.” Kennedy's leadership at the HHS has been subject to ongoing criticism. The MAHA zealot has pursued various fringe agendas (like removing synthetic dyes from cereal and other processed foods and reintroducing tallow into french fries) while moving to cut funding, staffing, and resources to arguably much more important initiatives—including mRNA vaccine development, cancer research, and other vital health programs.

The birds could provide important scientific insights, according to Kennedy. Children's Health Defense says it's illegal for news outlets to "censor" anti-vax garbage. "We need to stop trusting the experts," Kennedy told Tucker Carlson. Kennedy was asked to retract his statement, and only did so with a smirk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The propensity for AI systems to make mistakes that humans miss has been on full display in the US legal system as of late. The follies began when lawyers submitted documents citing cases that didn't exist. Similar mistakes soon spread to other roles in the courts. Last December, a Stanford professor submitted sworn testimony containing hallucinations and errors in a case about deepfakes, despite being an expert on AI and misinformation himself.Now, judges are experimenting with generative AI too. Are they right to be so confident in it? OpenAI's new GPT-5 model was supposed to give a glimpse of AI's newest frontier. It was meant to mark a leap toward the “artificial general intelligence” that tech's evangelists have promised will transform humanity for the better.

Following prior models based on the RTX 30 and 40 series, this new iteration introduces a significant redesign that includes the first-ever triple 120x25mm fan setup on a gaming GPU, employing Noctua's next-generation NF-A12x25 G2 fans alongside a thoroughly custom-engineered heatsink. The cooling system integrates an extensive vapor chamber with eleven heatpipes—seven 8 mm and four 6 mm, a notable increase from previous Noctua Editions, which typically featured fewer heatpipes and smaller heatsinks. This design aims to balance efficient thermal dissipation with minimized acoustic output. Noctua's new NF-A12x25 G2 fans incorporate advanced aerodynamic features such as Progressive Bend impellers and SupraTorque motors designed to maintain high airflow and static pressure in demanding environments like large heatsinks. The fans are deliberately offset in rotational speed—arranged in an A-B-A sequence with speed variations of roughly ±50 RPM—to mitigate acoustic phenomena like beat frequencies and periodic vibrations. Asus' internal testing at a 360W power target using FurMark stress tests reportedly showed the Noctua Edition achieved GPU temperatures of approximately 57°C and VRAM temperatures near 52°C, with noise levels measured at 21.4 dB(A). These figures would represent a substantial noise reduction—about 14.5 dB(A) less—compared to Asus's own ROG Astral RTX 5080 variant, while maintaining similar or lower operating temperatures. The card supports Asus' 0dB semi-passive fan control, which shuts off the fans entirely under 50°C GPU temperature, allowing for silent operation during light workloads. Physically, the RTX 5080 Noctua Edition is considerably larger than standard models, extending 385 mm in length and occupying nearly four slots due to the thick triple-fan assembly and enlarged heatsink. This size makes it incompatible with many mid-tower cases and necessitates careful system planning. Clock speeds on the Noctua Edition are set with a boost clock of 2700 MHz, modestly above the Founders Edition's 2600 MHz but below some factory-overclocked variants, reflecting Asus' apparent focus on thermals and acoustics over maximum out-of-the-box frequencies. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Asus' collaboration with Noctua dates back several generations, with earlier models on the RTX 3080 and RTX 4080 lines gaining attention for their unique brown fan design and quieter operation compared to competing variants. Each iteration has gradually introduced refinements in cooling architecture and fan technology, culminating in the current RTX 5080 Noctua Edition's triple-fan configuration and advanced heatsink design. While the card's technical approach delivers measurable reductions in noise and heat under stress, the tradeoffs include its considerable physical footprint and a boost clock that does not aggressively push performance limits compared to other RTX 5080 models. Availability and pricing for the ASUS GeForce RTX 5080 Noctua Edition have not been announced, but the card is available for £1,500 on Scan, that's about 50% more expensive than MSRP.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>REDMOND, Wash. — The first crewed flight around the moon in more than 50 years is still months away, but NASA is already saying thank you to L3Harris Technologies' Aerojet Rocketdyne segment and other suppliers who are making the trip possible. Now NASA is getting ready to launch four astronauts on a round-the-moon mission known as Artemis 2, powered in part by hardware built in Redmond. Hoburg, who spent six months on the International Space Station in 2023 and is awaiting his next crew assignment, told an audience of about 200 L3Harris employees and VIPs that the Artemis 2 crew is well aware of the company's contribution. The Artemis 2 mission is currently targeted for launch next April, or perhaps even earlier, said Howard Hu, NASA's program manager for the Orion crew vehicle. Now the team is working on thrusters for missions as far out as Artemis 8, which is scheduled to go the moon no earlier than 2033. The White House initially sought to cancel the Space Launch System and Orion programs after Artemis 3, and instead focus on a commercial alternative for Mars missions, such as SpaceX's Starship launch system. But Congress voted to stay the course — and Don Mahr, director of program management at L3Harris' Redmond facility, told GeekWire that NASA has told its suppliers to continue executing the current plan, at least for now. Amit Kshatriya, NASA's deputy associate administrator for the Moon to Mars Program, said propulsion systems from L3Harris will continue to be essential components in NASA's toolbox even if the long-term plan for Artemis changes. “It's the wrong argument to think about picking one thing or another,” he said. “The right argument is, how do we stimulate and create missions and capability across the country in all sorts of different capability classes.” “A shop like this is the DNA that we need to keep going, which is why we're so excited to be here,” he said. I would love to get to fly one of those missions myself, but I'm proud of our country that we're leading and executing these missions.” During today's thank-you gathering in Redmond, four L3Harris Aerojet employees received awards from NASA for their contributions to the Artemis program. Brett Mendenhall and Richard Mirabella were given NASA's Silver Snoopy Award, which must be pinned onto the winner's lapel by an astronaut. “That was the part where I try not to draw any blood,” Hoburg quipped.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That shocking finale coda of Hwang Dong-hyuk's Squid Game series left many curious about what it meant for the American spin-off Netflix has in the works. When the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) pauses next to an alley in downtown Los Angeles, you witness, along with him, the Squid Game recruitment ritual being administered by a new face: Cate Blanchett, wearing a suit and offering up the Ddakji slaps. It's hard to believe the Academy Award-winning actress was only recruited for a one-off cameo right after she claimed to be retired. In an interview with Variety, Blanchett discussed how the guest role came to be and what it might mean for her future in the franchise. “Because it's such a cult series and they were shooting in L.A. of all places, everyone was on a need-to-know basis,” she said of the “out of the blue offer” that stipulated she bring her own suit. But it was one of the more mysterious jobs.” Blanchett explained that while her role was a feature on the series finale, she'd consider returning. “I am wildly open to anything,” she shared with the trade, “and in a world that is so beautifully, magically created like that, for sure. They're amazing world-builders, and that series has been eaten alive. What's so playfully suspicious about her answers is that Netflix has enlisted David Fincher for his take on the American Squid Game spin-off. And he happens to be a filmmaker Blanchett worked with on The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, so what gives?
