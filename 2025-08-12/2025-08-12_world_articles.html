                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump forwarded a false narrative around DC crime stats to justify the move. Plus, funeral held in Gaza for five journalists killed by Israeli attack Donald Trump has ordered the national guard to Washington DC and seized control of the city's police force, describing a “lawless” city in ways that are sharply at odds with official crime statistics. The president's move was swiftly condemned as a “disgusting, dangerous and derogatory” assault on the political independence of a racially diverse city. Speaking at a White House press conference on Monday, Trump alleged DC was “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the world”, even though violent crime is at a 30-year low. That Trump is spreading a false narrative about DC crime – just as he did with LA. Violent crime in DC is at a 30-year low. Sharif, one of Al Jazeera's most recognisable faces in Gaza, was killed while inside a tent for journalists outside al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on Sunday night. How deadly has the war been for journalists? Before Sunday's airstrike, the Committee to Protect Journalists recorded at least 186 journalists and media workers killed in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel and Lebanon since the war began, making it the deadliest period for journalists since it began gathering data in 1992. Israel, which has refused to let international media into Gaza, denies the accusation. Trump, without evidence, alleged McEntarfer “faked” employment numbers in the run-up to the 2024 election to boost Kamala Harris's chances and said that the recent data was “rigged” to make Trump and Republicans look bad. Experts fear Trump's interventions will undermine the credibility of the agency's economic data, long seen as a gold standard. Donald Trump said he and Vladimir Putin would discuss “land swapping” when they meet on Friday in Alaska for a summit on the Ukraine war, and expressed frustration with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Meanwhile, Trump again delayed implementing sweeping tariffs on China, announcing another 90-day pause hours before the last agreement expired. “It felt like thunder,” said one worker near the scene. Villagers whose farms in Vietnam will be bulldozed to make way for a $1.5bn golf resort backed by the Trump family have reportedly been offered rice provisions and cash compensation of as little as $12 for a square meter of land by state authorities. Thousands of villagers will be offered compensation based on land size and location, according to a report by Reuters. Before his killing, he prepared a message for his family, and calling for the world not to forget Gaza. “I have lived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification,” he writes. Nurdles: they're buoyant, the size of a lentil and almost impossible to recover. Ventriloquism is back in vogue on stage and online.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed on Tuesday not to give eastern Ukrainian land to Russia, saying that abandoning the Donbas region would open the door for Russian President Vladimir Putin to “start a third war” in Ukraine. Zelensky's warning comes ahead of Putin's meeting with US President Donald Trump in Alaska on Friday, where the Russian president is expected to demand Ukrainian land as part of a peace deal. While there is confusion over Putin's reported conditions for a ceasefire, most versions stress that the Russian president will demand that Ukrainian forces withdraw from all parts of Ukraine's Donbas, which includes parts of the Donetsk region it still holds. If we leave Donbas of our own accord or under pressure, we will start a third war,” Zelensky said in a meeting with journalists. Russian troops pierce Ukraine's patchy defenses in Donetsk, days before Trump-Putin summit Zelensky and Ukrainian military officials have warned that Russia is building up troops for a new offensive, ready to launch by September. “I haven't heard anything — not a single proposal that would guarantee that a new war won't start tomorrow and that Putin won't try to occupy at least Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv,” the Ukrainian president told reporters. “The exchange of territories is a very complex issue that cannot be separated from security guarantees for Ukraine, for our sovereign state and our people,” Zelensky added, noting that the European Union's involvement in peace talks is also crucial because “no one except Europe is giving us security guarantees.” Trump has signaled Zelensky would not participate in Friday's summit, though the US president previewed his plans to phone Kyiv immediately after the meeting, along with other European leaders, to brief them. “I'm not going to make a deal,” Trump said. “Only one party that's involved in this war is going to be present, and so this is for the president to go and to get, again, a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. Zelensky also gave further details on Tuesday about the diplomatic talks that have been taking place behind the scenes, as well as his take on the outcome of US special envoy Steve Witkoff's meeting with Putin. “Witkoff said that there should be territorial concessions on both sides. And that Putin probably wants us to leave Donbas. So it didn't sound like America wants us to leave,” Zelensky said. I believe that Trump represents the United States of America.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Contrary to President Trump's claims, eliminating cash bail has made Illinois safer, advocates say. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. While announcing plans to send National Guard troops into the country's capital, the Trump administration spread falsehoods about crime in Washington, D.C., as well as legal system measures like Illinois's bail reform. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. This new system means that “people who pose a threat to their community will not be able to purchase their release,” Allie Preston, a senior policy analyst for the Center for American Progress, wrote in a report on the legislation. After Trump's remarks, the Illinois Network for Pretrial Justice, a coalition of organizations that championed the state's bail reform law, sent out a press release stating that “violent crime has actually significantly decreased since Illinois implemented the Pretrial Fairness Act.” Despite Department of Justice data that shows crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low, Trump and members of his administration claimed that crime was rampant in the city, particularly offenses committed by children. “Our secret weapon here in D.C. is [U.S.] Attorney [for the District of Columbia] Jeanine Pirro, one of the toughest prosecutors and a former judge,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters. “She is going to be talking about juvenile crime, how it's out of control here.” Pirro said she sees “too much violent crime being committed by young punks,” and called for harsher punishments for children, contrary to research that shows incarceration causes catastrophic harm to kids and does not make communities safer. “[O]verwhelming evidence [shows] that incarceration is an ineffective strategy for steering youth away from delinquent behavior and that high rates of youth incarceration do not improve public safety,” according to a report from The Sentencing Project. Eduardo Ferrer, a law professor at Georgetown University and policy director of the Juvenile Justice Initiative, told Courthouse News that, “youth arrests are well below where they were pre-pandemic.” As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence search company Perplexity has made an unsolicited, $34.5 billion offer to purchase Google's Chrome browser, a surprise move by a Google Search challenger that's looking to upend how people find information online. The bid comes as Google awaits a court's decision after a landmark ruling last year found that the internet giant had violated US antitrust law with its search business. The US Justice Department has proposed as a remedy that Google sell its Chrome browser. Google has promised to appeal the ruling and called the idea of spinning off Chrome an “unprecedented proposal” that it says would harm consumers and security. Perplexity's offer — while likely a long shot, given Google's resistance to a forced sale of Chrome — marks the latest example of how new firms are taking on tech's biggest players to reshape the internet in the AI era. Perplexity is a nearly three-year-old startup whose search tool uses AI models to parse web content and curate answers. Answers are usually posted as a summary, although Perplexity does provide links to its sources. It launched an AI search engine that competes with Google's dominant offering in December 2022. AI search firm Perplexity makes $34.5 billion surprise bid for Google Chrome Perplexity launched its own AI-powered web browser called Comet in July. The company is pitching it as a more personalized browser that connects the dots between a user's calendars, browsing tabs, social channels and more. OpenAI is also said to be developing a web browser, according to Reuters, in yet another signal that AI companies are looking to play a bigger role in how people use the web. Perplexity said it would maintain users' current browsing preferences, including Google as the default search engine, if it were to buy Chrome, Dwyer told CNN. It would also commit to “continued available and support” for Chrome for 100 months and investing $3 billion in Chromium over the next 24 months, according to Dwyer. Chromium is Google's open-source underlying technology that other tech companies – including Microsoft and Perplexity – can use to build their own browsers. That makes Perplexity's offer for Chrome worth nearly double its own valuation. Google, meanwhile, is worth nearly $2.5 trillion; shares of the company (GOOGL) rose around 1% on Tuesday. “This is a smart and opportunistic move by Perplexity given the case against Google and regulatory scrutiny,” Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told CNN, adding that he estimates Chrome is worth at least $50 billion. Google Chrome isn't the only high profile acquisition target that Perplexity has pursued. The company said earlier this year it was making a bid to buy TikTok, after a law was passed last year requiring the social media app's parent company, ByteDance, to sell it to a non-China-based company or face a ban in the United States. Perplexity has also reportedly been eyeballed by bigger tech players — both Meta and Apple have had discussions about buying the AI search firm, according to reports from Bloomberg and The Information, although it's not clear the talks will go anywhere.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Proposal for 600 National Guard troops stationed across Alabama and Arizona bases to be deployed at short notice The Trump administration is reportedly weighing plans to establish a “domestic civil disturbance” force of hundreds of National Guard troops to deal with protests and unrest. The plan, seen by The Washington Post, suggests a rotation model using troops from units in multiple states, with personnel equipped with weapons and riot gear, and deployments lasting 90 days to “limit burnout”. If military aircraft and aircrews were needed on standby, the plans could cost hundreds of millions of dollars, according to documents seen by the Post. The proposal suggests Donald Trump plans to continue using US forces domestically. National Guard soldiers were seen arriving in the city on Tuesday morning. As well as deploying 800 National Guard troops to Washington, Mr Trump said he would bring the city's police department under federal control, becoming the first president in history to do so. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Kamala Harris's former running mate, said of the move: “The road to authoritarianism is littered with people telling you you're overreacting.” Meanwhile, rumoured Democrat 2028 hopeful, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker warned Mr Trump that he has “absolutely no right and no legal ability” to send troops to Chicago, adding: “I have talked about the fact that the Nazis in Germany in the '30s tore down a constitutional republic in just 53 days. “It does not take much, frankly, and we have a president who seems hell-bent on doing just that.” Muriel Bowser, the city's mayor, called the move “unsettling and unprecedented,” although she conceded that more policing in high-crime neighbourhoods could be a good thing. A similar idea to the proposed “domestic civil disturbance quick reaction force” was floated following Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, with around 600 troops put on notice in Arizona and Alabama. The documents were compiled by National Guard officials, with at least one action memo prepared by Elbridge Colby, a national security policy chief, which recommends the forces should receive extra training for this mission. Mr Colby is said to have frustrated Mr Trump earlier this year when he reportedly froze military aid to Ukraine because US stockpiles were low. The move was rapidly reversed by Mr Trump amid criticism of government incohesion.</p>

Delegates representing communities from as far as Nunavut in Canada to the extreme southern tip of South America eventually took their seats in the Ibero-American Hall, a space adorned with a massive, nearly 1,500-square-foot mural, appropriately called “The Union of Latin America” by Roberto Montenegro. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. “We are of course facing an authoritarian threat in the world: it is the return of fascist positions to power,” María José Pizarro, a Colombian senator from the ruling Pacto Historico coalition, told Truthout. “In the face of this, we must therefore build joint strategies that allow us to confront it in the best possible way in countries where this is already happening, and in those where it is not, to prevent the return of this type of government.” When it comes to hemispheric relations, U.S. President Donald Trump has pursued what has been described as a “divide and conquer” strategy, leveraging the national interests of one country against another and pitting neighbors against each other in order to squeeze out concessions from leaders. From the Atlas Network, a coalition of right-wing think tanks and advocacy groups that promote neoliberal policies globally, to Trump's open and blatant interference inside Brazil in order to back his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, in the face of charges over his effort to carry out a coup after losing the 2022 election, the far right has been successful in building trans-national links. One aim of the Pan-American Congress is to break down barriers between progressives and anti-fascists who have historically lacked an institutional space to better coordinate their own regional response. One standout feature of this gathering was the participation of elected representatives from the United States, including Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota), Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Illinois), Delia Ramírez (D-Illinois), and Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan); Canadian Members of Parliament (MPs), such as interim New Democratic Party leader Don Davies, Leah Gazan, and Lori Idlout; and MPs from the governing Liberals, such as Michael Coteau, also attended. Pizarro, who is also a potential candidate for Colombia's 2026 presidential election, described the participation of U.S. and Canadian lawmakers at the Pan-American Congress as “fundamental” and expressed optimism that this would be the beginning of a closer relationship with progressives in North America. “We don't see ourselves as isolated from North America, but rather the opposite, as part of an American continent that integrates us all,” said Pizarro. “We rarely have the opportunity to listen to each other, to talk, especially today when the United States government is speaking out strongly about its position on Latin America, its relationship with Latin America, and that conversation with progressive Democratic congressmembers, of course, must be strengthened,” she added. The enthusiasm for building closer ties goes both ways. U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib said she drew inspiration from her conversations with other lawmakers fighting for their communities and the power of connecting with fellow activists across the Americas. “We don't see ourselves as isolated from North America, but rather the opposite, as part of an American continent that integrates us all.” Tlaib drew parallels from her experience growing up in Detroit, Michigan, in a neighborhood impacted by corporate pollution with the stories she heard from colleagues at the congress from Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico. “We are now building these bridges and creating a movement that brings all of us together and understanding that connectivity,” Tlaib told Truthout. At every event over the course of the weekend, speakers spoke up in support of Palestine in no uncertain terms, firmly expressing their solidarity. “It's very rare that you see that in the United States Congress, but we saw it at the Pan-American Congress,” said Tlaib. Meanwhile, Colombian Deputy Minister of Multilateral Affairs Mauricio Jaramillo Jassir argued that countries with progressive governments have no choice but to break diplomatic relations with Israel. “It is an unjust, vile, incorrect persecution where, by virtue of being a migrant, or the color of your skin or your nationality, people are persecuted,” said Noroña. Trump has leaned on allies like El Salvador's far right President Nayib Bukele, who infamously agreed to detain more than 230 Venezuelan migrants sent from the U.S. in his notorious mega-prison before negotiations between Caracas and Washington eventually secured their release. Mexico in particular has faced enormous pressure from both U.S. political parties to crack down on migrants transiting through its territory as they try to reach the United States. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has explicitly declined to become a third-country destination for non-Mexican asylum seekers and has resisted U.S. efforts to impose such arrangements. As a result, the Trump administration has secured agreements with Guatemala and Honduras instead, arrangements that ultimately serve to undermine efforts by any one country in the region to resist the U.S.'s mass deportation agenda. Canadian MP Leah Gazan, a member of the Wood Mountain Lakota Nation who represents Winnipeg in Canada's House of Commons, said her time in Mexico left her feeling renewed and hopeful. “What's happened in Mexico is so inspiring … and to see women, progressive women, strong women, leading the narrative about the importance of humanizing politics, the importance of rooting democracy and human rights, is a refreshing change from what we're witnessing in Canada right now,” Gazan told Truthout. “I think we have a lot of lessons to learn from the Global South,” said Gazan. “Since being in the elected office, I've made an effort to set myself apart as somebody who sees the global community as one, someone who understands our destinies and our fates are intertwined, someone who understands that being in the United States provides us with great privileges but also with responsibilities,” Omar told Truthout. Omar has repeatedly expressed her solidarity with the Global South, especially Latin America, by participating in an on-the-ground delegation to Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in 2022, and through numerous legislative initiatives focusing on migration and human rights. The U.S. representative also shared her view that progressives in the U.S., especially those in elected office, have an elevated duty to end U.S. policies that harm people throughout the world, saying, “It is our policies that are actively responsible for sanctions, for militarization, for exploitation, and it is up to us to make sure that we are lifting our voices collectively to say, ‘No, there is another way. Trump's aggressive approach to relations with his neighbors in the region may have caught many somewhat off guard, but more than six months into his second term, leaders from this hemisphere have now adapted and are forming new united strategies to take on Trump. With the next Pan-American Congress set to take place in Uruguay next year, delegates such as Omar and Tlaib expressed a sense of hope and optimism that the gathering in Mexico City will serve as a turning point. As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Caisse CEO Charles Emond at a press conference in August, 2024. Mr. Emond says  on Tuesday that tariffs were a major concern for the pension fund as the markets plunged in April.Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press Total assets increased $23-billion to $496-billion in the six months to June 30, and the fund also surpassed its benchmarks for five- and 10-year returns. Real estate lagged, increasing by 0.1 per cent and falling short of a 1.2-per-cent benchmark, and private equity recorded a modest 3.4-per-cent increase. A debate is raging over Canadian pension plans' domestic investments — and Caisse's CEO is at the centre of it all Caisse CEO Charles Emond cautioned that tariff issues stemming from U.S. policy were a “major concern” in the first half of the year as markets plunged in April before bouncing back, and could still be cause for concern in the coming months. “Despite this overall performance, we must remain vigilant as we have yet to see the full effects of the U.S. administration's measures,” Mr. Emond said in a statement. One scenario on the Caisse's radar is the possibility that tariff measures could slow the U.S. economy and raise prices, driving up inflation and causing central banks to respond by holding interest rates higher. “The full impact of inflation has not been felt.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>European leaders will very quickly turn away from Vladimir Zelensky and try to improve relations with Russia, First Deputy Chairman of Russia's Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Vladimir Dzhabarov said on Thursday. The senator noted that at the moment European leaders are trying to prove that they are "presenting a united front" with Zelensky but the situation may change. "I think they will very quickly turn away from Zelensky when the time comes, and will just as quickly try to run even ahead of [U.S. President Donald] Trump in an attempt to establish some sort of relations with us," he told the Rossiya-24 TV channel. Dzhabarov also commented on the upcoming meeting between Russian and US Presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump on August 15, suggesting that, in addition to the Ukrainian issue, the two heads of state will discuss economic matters and the restoration of diplomatic relations. "Obviously, this will not happen in a single meeting – it will take time, and most importantly, patience from both sides," he added. Dzhabarov stressed that bargaining over the lawful territories of the Russian Federation will be out of place when it comes to resolving the Ukrainian conflict. "I mean all four new regions, as well as Crimea, which has long been part of Russia. These are our constitutional lands, our constitutional territories, and no one will bargain over this issue with the Americans, let alone the Ukrainians," the senator concluded. Trump said on August 8 that he hopes to hold a meeting with Putin in Alaska on August 15. This was later confirmed by Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov, who said that the two leaders will focus on discussing options for reaching a lasting settlement of the Ukrainian crisis.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fake heiress denies responsibility as social media users accuse her of mistreating the three bunnies This time, it is not posing as a German heiress or being jailed for four years, instead the convicted fraudster has been left “disturbed” and “horrified” after three rabbits used in her photoshoot were found dumped in a nearby park. Sorokin, who also went by the name Anna Delvey and is the subject of Netflix's Inventing Anna, shot to infamy after a high-profile court case. But this latest saga involves a photograph on her Instagram account, in which she is pictured outside a Tribeca subway station with a black ankle monitor – stipulated under the terms of her 2022 prison release – and holding two leashed rabbits. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. “I felt ashamed and embarrassed to be associated with it,” Sorokin said of the affair. The first bunny, a one-and-a-half-year-old Harlequin lop, was found in the bushes by Terry Chao near a cardboard box used as part of Sorokin's photoshoot last week. On Thursday, another rabbit was found near the same cardboard box, followed by a third on Sunday, near a black carrier bag, she told the New York Times. The man who photographed Sorokin, Jasper Egan Soloff, told the newspaper through a lawyer that it was not his shoot and claimed to have no knowledge of how the animals were obtained or handled. He added that they were being fostered by someone in New York, while Sorokin said she offered to help rehome the rabbits when she learned they had been abandoned. People on social media have accused Sorokin of animal cruelty. Many commenters decried her use of the animals as props, and warned against photographing bunnies on leashes on their backs, a position known as trancing that can be harmful to the animals. I would never condone these actions,” Sorokin told the website Page Six. After being convicted in 2019 on multiple counts of larceny and theft, she was released after nearly four years in jail and a further 18 months in immigration detention for overstaying her visa, and was told to refrain from posting on social media.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand Up Alaska NGO plans to hold a protest ahead of the upcoming meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the northwestern U.S. state, according to an Aug. 11 statement. As Washington seeks a path to end the war in Ukraine, the upcoming Aug. 15 meeting between Trump and Putin will mark their first face-to-face talks since the start of Trump's second term. "We're here to tell Trump and Putin: Alaska opposes tyranny!" The rally, scheduled for Aug. 14 in Anchorage, Alaska's largest city, is being held to protest the "presence of an international war criminal" and as a show of solidarity with Ukraine, the NGO said. "With a mere two miles separating Russia from Alaska, no other place plays a more vital role in our national defense, energy security, and Arctic leadership," he added. Though it remains unclear what such a deal would entail, a source in Ukraine's Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent that Moscow seeks Kyiv's full withdrawal from partially occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in the east while offering to withdraw its forces from the limited areas it holds in the northeastern Sumy and Kharkiv oblasts. In turn, Zelensky has rejected formally ceding territory to Russia and urged a ceasefire as the first step toward peace talks, a position backed by Kyiv's European partners. Zelensky is also expected to hold talks with European leaders and Trump two days before the summit in Alaska, on Aug. 13. The technology provides connectivity when traditional cellular networks are unavailable, particularly during power outages from Russian strikes on critical infrastructure. The General Staff said more than 110,000 Russian troops are concentrated in the Pokrovsk area and are attempting to penetrate defenses by sending small infantry units between Ukrainian lines. Russian forces advanced toward the Dobropillia–Kramatorsk highway in Donetsk Oblast, seizing positions in nearby settlements to support further offensive operations. The Polish police detained more than 100 people over the weekend following an Aug. 9 concert of Belarusian rapper Max Korzh at Warsaw's National Stadium. The rally, scheduled for Aug. 14 in Anchorage, is being held to protest the "presence of an international war criminal" and as a show of solidarity with Ukraine, Stand Up Alaska said. The Financial Times identified 7 million square meters of new industrial development after tracking changes at 150 facilities across 37 companies, namely those associated with ammunition and missile production.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MOSCOW, August 12. Europe's leaders are painting a picture of a Russian "enemy" to offload responsibility for the severe socio-economic crisis facing their countries, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Expert magazine in an interview. "To justify aggression and divert societal frustration against Russia, a complex campaign of defamation has been launched - fueled by constant provocations, falsehoods, and outright lies. In the midst of a profound socio-economic crisis, today's European leaders are seemingly in desperate need of an ‘enemy' to blame for their failures and troubles," she explained. Zakharova further asserted that Euro-Atlantic capitals remain committed to achieving a "strategic defeat" of Russia, willing to go to any lengths to realize this objective. "The West has fostered and supported the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev, fixated on eradicating everything Russian. Despite failed blitzkrieg strategies, sanctions, and efforts to arm Kiev's regime, these measures have not shifted the realities on the frontlines," she said. She also highlighted ongoing efforts to implant an "anti-Russian, Russophobic worldview" globally. "It's important to recognize that these efforts are centuries old - from 19th-century newspapers and press to 20th-century anti-Soviet propaganda and Hollywood films, and now to the orchestrated campaigns and provocations of the modern era. Today, we are witnessing the peak of these Russophobic efforts," Zakharova concluded.</p>

YOKOHAMA — Japanese table tennis ace Tomokazu Harimoto made a strategic choice to abandon one of his strongest techniques, and it paid off by adding an impressive title to his growing resume. Harimoto defeated reigning world champion Wang Chuqin 4-2 in the men's final of the WTT Champions Yokohama tournament on Monday, avenging a whitewash loss to the Chinese star just a month ago. Harimoto went into the match with just two wins over Wang in 14 career meetings, including his straight sets loss last month in the United States. Needing an edge, Harimoto decided to not use the “chiquita,” a powerful backhand return with tremendous spin that curves like a banana. “He's the one guy who can return it with twice as much power,” Harimoto said of the No. “I can't believe it,” Harimoto repeatedly said after the match. Earlier, Harimoto advanced to the final with a 4-1 victory over Kanak Jha of the United States. In an all-Chinese women's final, Chen Xingtong defeated world champion Sun Yingsha 4-2.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. He previously served as Special Assistant to Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work, and as a speechwriter for Secretaries of Defense Robert Gates, Leon Panetta, and Chuck Hagel. Since then, we have made regular trips to Ukraine, affording us firsthand insight into a monumental transformation: the beginning of a new kind of warfare. In summer 2023, the commander of Ukraine's Third Assault Brigade's Drone Unit, whom we'll call Fil (not his real name), told us that a new weapon had begun to change the conflict: first-person-view drones. That year, Ukraine flooded the field with thousands of them and Russia soon followed suit. Indeed, two years ago, a Ukrainian brigade's strength was judged mostly by its inventory of Western-supplied tanks, armored personnel carriers, and artillery. Today, a unit's power and resilience are dictated by its number of skilled drone operators and its ability to deploy drones at scale. (One of us, Schmidt, has been a longtime investor in defense technology companies, and is currently an investor in companies supplying drones to Ukraine.) In the world's first drone war, drones determine how battles are won and how soldiers die: Ukrainian drone strikes now account for 90 percent of destroyed Russian tanks and armored vehicles and 80 percent of Russian casualties. They have also made it possible for each side to attack far past the frontlines without having to gain air superiority over the battlefield. Ukraine, for example, hit Russian airbases 5,000 miles from Kyiv in June by smuggling drones across the border and launching them from the beds of trucks. Russia, for its part, was originally slower to field drones in large numbers. Today, Moscow matches Kyiv's extraordinary rate of technological adaptation. It has developed equally capable models, such as the Orlan, which is used for surveillance, and the Lancet, which loiters over a target before exploding on impact. The saturation of drone surveillance, for example, has made nearly all troop movement visible and therefore vulnerable, creating a transparent battlefield: anything that moves near the frontline is struck within a matter of minutes. Amid this cycle of innovation, the two sides are inching toward a new frontier: entirely automated warfare. To avoid detection, movement near the frontline tends to take place during sunrise and sunset, when neither the daylight video cameras nor night-vision infrared cameras operate properly. If a unit is “blinded”—unable to maintain surveillance drones overhead—it becomes exceedingly vulnerable. For that reason, roughly 3,000 Ukrainian troops work around the clock to operate reconnaissance drones, mostly Chinese-made DJI Mavics, along the entire 750-mile frontline. This transparency means that the military maxim “what can be seen can be hit” is truer on today's battlefield than at any point in history. It is nearly impossible for either side to mass and maneuver forces along the frontline, as troops are now easily spotted forming up for attack. The Russian army has historically relied on its ability to deliver impressive firepower through concentrated tube and rocket artillery fire, but these tactics are useless when any attempt to amass forces is identified within minutes. Russian guns are now widely dispersed, deeply dug in, and operate primarily at night. The brigade's frontline operations are driven by data, of which there is more every day. Fil's brigade, for example, tracks every engagement, drone mission, and vehicle or piece of equipment hit. That data, in turn, drives decision-making, including over the kinds and quantities of drones to procure. Fil's team spends nearly $2 million each month on small quadcopters, mostly Mavics, for frontline reconnaissance and more than $500,000 per month for longer-range fixed-wing surveillance drones, such as Sharks or Lelekas, that can be used to see much farther from the frontline. This is expensive, but one new battle tank costs more than $10 million. A tank was long regarded as the best weapon to defeat another tank; now, a first-person-view drone costing less than $800 is, thanks to its ability to strike with precision and move much faster than any ground vehicle. No armored vehicle—no matter its camouflage or anti-drone barriers—can survive for long on the modern, drone-swept battlefield. As a result, Ukrainian soldiers believe tank-led assaults to be suicidal. Russia still launches them occasionally, but most do not make it to the front line. In response, Russia has shifted primarily to infantry assaults. It is no surprise, then, that more than 75 percent of Ukrainian drones now target infantry. Because surveillance drones have a difficult time spotting scattered infantry in urban terrain and forests, the Russians are deploying small assault groups, typically consisting of five or six teams of two to three people, to simultaneously attack a concentrated area. Over days or even weeks, the Russians gather their forces until they judge that they have sufficient strength to make the next bound toward Ukrainian positions. Drone-on-drone battle is now a central part of the war. Last year, an estimated 1,200 Russian surveillance drones were operating behind Ukrainian lines on a given day, so Ukraine built the first drone-based air defense system to fend them off. Russian surveillance drones now fly higher to avoid Ukrainian interception. Still, roughly 80 percent of all surveillance drones that cross the frontline, be they Russian or Ukrainian, are shot down by either interceptors or traditional air defenses. Instead, it has developed smaller, faster, and camouflaged surveillance drones, including some with rear-facing cameras, that let operators spot and evade pursuing drones. Unsurprisingly, drone pilots and their control stations have become prime targets for both sides. Fil's unit has found that a successful attack on Russian Mavic operators can pause enemy activity for three days. In an attempt to further decrease the number of forward-deployed soldiers, Ukraine is now working to establish a so-called drone line along its entire frontline—a layered defense corridor six or seven miles wide, made up of obstacles such as ditches, minefields, and razor wire, and hundreds of drone teams that wait at the ready to destroy any targets before they reach Ukrainian positions. Once this barrier is in place, and more drone functions are automated, far fewer troops will need to defend the frontline. Ukraine hopes that this approach will help alleviate its manpower shortfalls and save lives. Behind the frontlines, tactics are evolving just as fast. On a nightly basis, Russia launches hundreds of Shahed long-range drones at Ukraine, particularly its major cities. Russia increasingly uses sequenced launches and circuitous route planning so that multiple drones arrive at their target simultaneously from different directions; these attacks amount to manually coordinated “drone swarms.” Short of air defense systems, Ukraine has prioritized the development and production of interceptor drones to counter these swarms. Russia also sends dozens of cheaper “dummy” drones—drones without real capabilities—into Ukrainian airspace, forcing air defense radars to reveal their locations. Russian ballistic and cruise missiles then route around the defenses to strike their targets. To create an effective weapon now requires adapting and iterating against an equally adaptive adversary, resulting in a highly dynamic contest of action and reaction. Once a new weapon or technique is introduced to the battlefield, it has a limited window of utility before the opponent develops countermeasures. Unlike drones that run on standard radio frequency, these quadcopters spool up to 25 miles of fiber-optic cable in their wake, leaving them hard-wired to their operator. Although these drones are slow and limited by the length of their wire, they are impervious to jamming, relay clear images, and can operate outside radio line of sight, which means that they are well suited for hilly and urban terrain. Since they do not emit radio signals, their pilot's location cannot be identified by electronic means, and they strike with shocking precision. Their high-quality control signal and camera resolution allows them to be maneuvered with pinpoint accuracy into tight areas, such as buildings and bunkers, that normal first-person-view drones, which rely on radio, cannot access. Russia now has elite units of drone pilots using fiber-optic drones stationed along heavily contested parts of the frontline in order to target Ukrainian drone operators, attack enemy supply lines, and ultimately isolate forward units. For the most part, Ukraine still uses first-person-view drones because they are cheap, relatively easy to use, and readily available. Brigades on the most active fronts consume more than 5,000 of them per month. But because their rate of success in striking a target is low, estimated at no more than ten percent for the average unit, many frontline units favor larger bomber-type drones for their versatility, reusability, and modular configurations. A single Ukrainian-made Vampire hexacopter drone, for example, can drop antitank mines or rain down munitions on enemy infantry, achieving the same effect as dozens of artillery rounds, and with greater precision. They are also better at targeting infantry when repelling assaults and can collapse buildings with a few accurately placed explosives that would otherwise have taken hundreds of artillery rounds. Bomber drones can also place mines, a tactic that is quickly becoming one of the most effective ways to halt Russian assaults. Russian units on the attack must use largely predictable routes because of terrain, so Ukrainian forces create a dynamic, mobile minefield by dropping mines in their path. Ukrainian forces then use first-person-view drones to herd Russian vehicles toward the mines. One Ukrainian brigade estimates that 50 percent of enemy vehicle kills in recent months have resulted from drone mining. When Russian infantry are protecting a valuable target, for instance, Ukrainian troops use artillery to suppress the infantry so that Ukrainian bomber drones can destroy the target without being shot down. Ukrainian troops will also use surveillance drones to ascertain where Russian drone pilots are before shelling those locations. Automating drones with artificial intelligence would solve a variety of problems facing the modern warfighter. A large number of drones are lost to pilot error. And the Ukrainian battlefield is saturated with systems that jam and spoof signals across the electromagnetic spectrum, making it difficult to rely on any technology that requires constant radio connection to a human operator. Today, algorithms can augment human control of the battlefield. They reduce error by helping pilots detect, track, approach, and strike targets. Ukrainian and Western companies are creating software that supports drone pilots even more, by selecting routes, stabilizing flights, navigating to waypoints, recognizing targets, and guiding toward the destination. If these efforts are successful, becoming a drone pilot will require fewer skills and less experience. In particular, defense firms are keen to develop AI tools that make it easier to carry out the final phase of an attack. The Ukrainian battlefield is a challenge for machine learning because enemy tanks and artillery pieces constantly change appearance with added armor and camouflage. Algorithms also perform poorly at identifying scattered infantry, particularly in dense forests or other complex terrain. AI-assisted target acquisition and terminal guidance have already proved effective even in the face of radio signal jamming. Although the future of fully autonomous drones is unclear, a more autonomous drone strike complex—one that combines reconnaissance and strike drones to identify, track, and hit moving targets—would enormously improve Ukraine's ability to defend against Russian attacks. Defense companies are also racing to create AI that can coordinate attacks by multiple drones in an automated drone swarm—the holy grail of drone operations. Today, Ukrainian forces can form a carousel of drones over a target to repeatedly strike at it, but doing so requires multiple pilots and operators. With an automated drone swarm, a single pilot could guide many drones, flying independent routes, to overwhelm defenses and saturate a target. These networks exist, but not at the required scale. Eventually, Ukraine will need its own version of Israel's Iron Dome air defense network to protect its cities and factories from Russia's constant drone and missile raids. Of course, Ukraine's vast size makes this a daunting challenge, but it can begin by shielding its major cities. Greater automation will be key to fending off Russian attacks. Military doctrine, tactics, and organization will never be the same. Its adversary is also getting better at drone production: last year, Russia was building 300 Shahed drones a month. Now, it can produce 5,000 in the same time frame. And it is in the interest of the West, and of the United States in particular, to support the Ukrainian people in their dogged determination to win that fight—not only for Ukraine's sake but also for its own, so it can learn to reckon with this new reality of war.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Since then, his administration has ramped up immigration raids on businesses, threatened widespread deportation, and canceled temporary legal status for more than a million people living in the United States. Even as voters have soured somewhat on the administration's extreme tactics, more Americans approve of Trump's immigration policies than they do any of his actions in other areas. The United States is not an outlier when it comes to public hostility toward immigration. Far-right parties, which often base their appeal on bashing immigrants and calling for tighter border controls, are now the most popular political force in Europe. Even center-left governments, such as that of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, have felt obliged to embrace hard-line immigration measures out of fear of losing further ground to the surging far right. Immigration is not a zero-sum game: more immigration can boost local and national economies while improving the fortunes of people seeking better lives. Immigration advocates blame racial prejudice or misinformation for opposition to immigration and point to demagoguery that scapegoats vulnerable immigrants for economic and social problems. Although prejudice and ignorance likely play some role in shaping attitudes—and elite politicians are powerful forces in driving public opinion—the fact is that many citizens have genuine concerns about immigration that cannot be ignored. These include practical worries about whether the state can maintain order, promote fair job competition, and ensure that housing and public services do not become overstretched. Finding a better political solution must start with understanding what drives public backlash to immigration. Many citizens are deeply troubled by mismanaged flows of people into their country. Until decision-makers craft more targeted immigration policy that straightforwardly focuses on how immigrants can provide economic benefits, anti-immigrant attitudes and parties will continue to gain ground. Most observers believe that governments should be more responsive to voters on immigration, but they often fail to understand what the public wants. One popular approach to addressing the anti-immigrant backlash is to set numerical targets, such as the United Kingdom's goal of reducing “net migration.” This reflects a tendency to think of immigration as a numbers game. If governing parties assume that voters simply want fewer immigrants, they pursue policies to limit overall immigration. But research shows that even when mainstream politicians embrace hard-line positions such as capping the number of new immigrants, they still fail to win over disaffected voters. The lack of direct connection between public attitudes and numbers of immigrants also helps explain why people living in areas with relatively few immigrants can still strongly oppose immigration when the issue is salient nationally. If voters perceive new immigrants as helpful to their community and the country at large, they are likely to support more immigration and reject strict anti-immigration politics. In my research, I found that citizens in the United Kingdom opposed immigration if they believed it harmed their fellow citizens. A large majority of people in the United States—including Trump supporters who cheer on his harsh immigration crackdowns—favor attracting new high-skilled professionals who can help maintain the United States' technological edge. This is not just a problem of unconvincing rhetoric. Rather, the immigration system is so convoluted and mismanaged that few people believe that immigration can possibly help the country thrive. Or, with enough rhetorical swagger, a charismatic pro-immigration politician could provide them with facts that would convince them to support immigration policies whose benefits outweigh the costs to society. But better designed policies can help build support for immigration. Examples from a variety of wealthy democracies suggest that immigration policies focused on addressing a host country's economic needs are more likely to win support than immigration policies rooted in humanitarian concerns. Consider Sweden, where far-right anti-immigration parties have swelled in response to recent waves of immigration. The uncomfortable fact is that foreign-born people in Sweden, many of whom arrived as asylum seekers, on average pay less in taxes than the state spends on benefits to support them. Widely publicized violent incidents in immigrant neighborhoods became national flashpoints, which the public linked to a failure to integrate new immigrants into Swedish society. To be sure, economists have argued that accepting even low-skilled immigrants typically has knock-on effects that contribute to economic growth and benefit society. Immigrants can fill essential jobs and push native-born workers into higher-paying positions. They can help revive depressed communities in rural or post-industrial areas. But most voters cannot see these benefits, which, if they occur, are widely spread out and become evident only many years later. Canada, by contrast, has built a system that admits large numbers of immigrants but is selective in doing so. To attract needed workers, the Canadian government uses a points-based approach that prioritizes people with rare or sought-after skills. Immigrants are admitted largely based on what they can contribute to society in the near term. The immigration process uses transparent criteria, such as education or regional demand for workers, which most voters can understand. As a result, anti-immigrant demagogues have gained little traction in national politics. Determining who can immigrate based on a points rubric or where workers are needed may seem cold and unfeeling in the face of the deeply human imperatives that drive international migration. As my research shows, no democracy has ever managed to ease widespread immigration concerns without being very selective about whom to admit. In other words, Canada's experience shows that when immigration policies are demonstrably aligned with national needs, they build public goodwill that can later extend to more vulnerable newcomers, including refugees. A points-based system to admit “the best and brightest” is just one of many possible policies that can make immigration popular. Any policy that primarily focuses on solving visible national problems while signaling control of population flows is likely to make the public feel good about immigration, while those that explicitly sideline citizens' interests are more likely to spur backlash, resentment, and populism. Immigration policies that focus on filling labor shortages, revitalizing struggling regions, or supporting family reunification of immediate relatives can all win public support. Some politicians will always seek to exploit immigration anxieties, exaggerate problems, and spread misinformation. This isn't because Canadians are more tolerant, nor is it because their leaders have found the perfect communication strategy to sway the population. Rather, it's because voters can see that Canadian immigration policies work. The more that democratic governments take public concerns seriously and craft immigration policies that clearly benefit society in ways people can understand, the less space there is for xenophobic populists to claim that only they have the country's interests at heart. Responsible democratic governments serious about making immigration politically viable must also be willing to compromise. But real solutions lie in which types of immigration policies countries pursue. Work-oriented policies, rather than humanitarian-based ones, are more likely to command broad support. Sweden has finally begun moving in this direction by introducing more selective immigration criteria. Inspired by Canada, Germany has also adopted its own version of a points-based immigration system; in 2024, the country issued ten percent more skilled worker visas than the year prior. Implementing a points-based system will not solve all problems, however. How such a system is designed matters for its success. Many so-called merit-based proposals—such as some of those Republicans have proposed in the U.S. Senate in the past decade—will not help if their primary aim is to find a new way to cut overall admissions. Instead, what builds public support is an immigration policy visibly tied to labor demand, immediate work authorization for new arrivals, and publicly reported benefits of immigration that voters can understand. Advanced democracies could also adopt immigration policies tied to demonstrable regional needs. These policies are most effective when visas are designed to be portable across approved local employers and the policies lay out a path to permanent status for workers after a period of sustained employment. Similarly, governments can establish bilateral employment partnerships to fast-track visas or permanent residency status for workers from a specific country with relevant skills. These partnerships can apply to fields with national labor shortages, such as eldercare, construction, engineering, or artificial intelligence. The logic is the same as for dedicated taxes: voters often support tax increases when they know exactly how their tax money will be used. When citizens see immigration policies that are effective—bringing in doctors at understaffed hospitals, entrepreneurs who create jobs, or caregivers who support aging populations—they also see their own communities benefiting. The fact that targeted, well-managed immigration policies are more popular than purely humanitarian approaches does not preclude helping those in need. Governments are more likely to gain public support when they strictly enforce immigration rules, quickly provide accepted refugees with the right to work, match them to open jobs, and expand the role of communities and private companies in sponsoring new arrivals.

A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island's coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse. According to the lawsuit filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Friday, Ohtani's agent, Nez Balelo, increasingly demanded concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding that their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal. “Balelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani's promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs' role in the project — for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,” the lawsuit claims. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture. A spokesman for Balelo's agency, CAA Baseball, declined comment. Attempts to reach Kingsbarn officials for comment were not immediately successful. “This case is about abuse of power,” the lawsuit says. “Defendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Ohtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. Investment materials for The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort, which remained online on Monday night, listed Hayes and Matsumoto as part of the management team, along with Kingsbarn. “He also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training.” “Kingsbarn began capitulating to Balelo's every whim,” the suit said. Last month, in what the suit called “a coordinated ambush,” Kingsbarn fired Hayes and Matsumoto. Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A plant producing synthetic sapphires in the Russian city of Stavropol was hit by drones overnight on Aug. 12, the Russian independent Telegram news channel Astra reported, citing local residents. Footage taken by locals shows smoke rising from the same street where the factory is located, according to Astra. Following the attack, Stavropol Mayor Ivan Ulyanchenko said the drone attack had been "repelled" and that there were no casualties. Ulyanchenko did not mention the strike on the Monocrystal factory, claiming only that windows had been broken at an unnamed "social facility." Monocrystal is one of the world's leading manufacturers of synthetic sapphire, which is used in optoelectronics, solar energy, and the aerospace industry. Synthetic sapphire is used in optical systems, sensors, and lasers, including military devices. Monocrystal is a subsidiary of Energomera, an electronics and manufacturing company. In late July, Ukraine's State Security Service (SBU) confirmed that a drone strike hit the Signal radio plant in Stavropol Krai. Abbey Fenbert is a senior news editor at the Kyiv Independent.

The technology provides connectivity when traditional cellular networks are unavailable, particularly during power outages from Russian strikes on critical infrastructure. The General Staff said more than 110,000 Russian troops are concentrated in the Pokrovsk area and are attempting to penetrate defenses by sending small infantry units between Ukrainian lines. Russian forces advanced toward the Dobropillia–Kramatorsk highway in Donetsk Oblast, seizing positions in nearby settlements to support further offensive operations. The Polish police detained more than 100 people over the weekend following an Aug. 9 concert of Belarusian rapper Max Korzh at Warsaw's National Stadium. The rally, scheduled for Aug. 14 in Anchorage, is being held to protest the "presence of an international war criminal" and as a show of solidarity with Ukraine, Stand Up Alaska said. The Financial Times identified 7 million square meters of new industrial development after tracking changes at 150 facilities across 37 companies, namely those associated with ammunition and missile production.</p>
