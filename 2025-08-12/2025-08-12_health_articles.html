                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this interview, News Medical‑Life Sciences speaks with  Dr. Todd Bauman, Senior Director of Supply Chain, and Chris Povich, Vice President of Automation, at Ascential Medical & Life Sciences about right shoring in life sciences and how medical manufacturers are aligning supply chain strategy with cost, risk, and resilience in today's complex global environment. Todd Bauman: I'm Dr. Todd Bauman, Senior Director of Supply Chain at Ascential, where I lead strategy focused on cost control, operational risk reduction, and long‑term value across our global medical and life sciences manufacturing network. My role is to support our customers in automating production systems, helping them mitigate risk and scale efficiently across regions while maintaining compliance and quality in medical manufacturing. Todd: Right shoring is not just a choice between offshoring and reshoring. It's about aligning your supply chain footprint with your business goals, customer needs, and external pressures such as tariffs or labor shortages. It takes into account the total cost, risk exposure, and resilience over time. Todd: Cost miscalculations, geopolitical instability, long lead times, and inventory shocks—like we saw during COVID—are major drivers. Ethical sourcing concerns and public perception also play a role. Supply chains optimized purely for labor cost are increasingly exposed. Chris: Automation is essential, especially when reshoring to higher labor-cost regions. By investing in automation, companies can reduce labor dependence, increase throughput, and improve quality. It also helps speed up workforce training and enables faster scaling of duplicate lines across geographies. This reduces logistics risk, regulatory hurdles, and increases resilience by localizing supply where we manufacture. Duplicating a line requires reevaluation of obsolete components and sourcing constraints. Labor cost and skill shortages may make full transfers costly, so automation often becomes a necessary investment. Timeline, compliance, and capital cost are all key factors. Todd: Landed cost looks at transport and tariffs, but TCO includes overhead, warranty costs, inspection, and reverse logistics. TCO offers a more holistic view, and when tariffs rise—as they have for aluminum from China—it often tips the scales toward reshoring or regionalizing. Chris: Look for a global partner with mature local capabilities. They should offer deep engineering breadth, regulatory knowledge, and regional service support. This reduces costs, travel burdens, and improves time to market. At Ascential, our footprint and flexibility allow for scalable, localized execution across the globe. Chris Povich is Vice President of Automation at Ascential Medical & Life Sciences. He brings extensive experience in automation strategy, system integration, and operational scale-up for the life sciences sector.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cats with dementia have brain changes similar to those of people with Alzheimer's disease, offering a valuable model for studying the condition in humans, a study says. The findings offer a clearer picture of how amyloid-beta may lead to age-related brain dysfunction and memory loss in cats, experts say. Many older cats develop dementia, leading to behavioural changes such as increased vocalisation – or meowing – confusion and disrupted sleep – symptoms similar to those seen in people with Alzheimer's disease. Powerful microscopy images revealed a build-up of amyloid-beta within the synapses – connections between brain cells – of older cats and cats with dementia. Their loss strongly predicts reduced memory and thinking abilities in humans with Alzheimer's disease. This process, called synaptic pruning, is important during brain development but can contribute to synapse loss in dementia. Experts say the findings will not only help to understand and manage dementia in cats but, given their similarities, could also contribute to the development of future treatments for people with Alzheimer's disease. Scientists studying Alzheimer's disease in the past have relied heavily on genetically modified rodent models. Dementia is a devastating disease - whether it affects humans, cats, or dogs. Our findings highlight the striking similarities between feline dementia and Alzheimer's disease in people. This opens the door to exploring whether promising new treatments for human Alzheimer's disease could also help our ageing pets. Because cats naturally develop these brain changes, they may also offer a more accurate model of the disease than traditional laboratory animals, ultimately benefiting both species and their caregivers." Professor Danièlle Gunn-Moore, Personal Chair of Feline Medicine at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, said: "Feline dementia is so distressing for the cat and for its person. It is by undertaking studies like this that we will understand how best to treat them. Feline dementia is the perfect natural model for Alzheimer's, everyone benefits." McGeachan, R. I., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Research from the Nanoscience Center of the University of Jyväskylä, Finland, has revealed that lignin, a polyphenol, important for plant structure, has antimicrobial activity against viruses and bacteria. The results highlight that lignin, which is also an important by-product from wood industry, has potential as promising green alternative to synthetic antimicrobial agents for coating agents, packaging material, or surface disinfectants. The research is fruitful collaboration with Spinnova Oy and CH Bioforce. The University of Jyväskylä study used a simple water-based extraction method, in which lignin was isolated in high purity from birch chips, wheat straw and oat husks. - We revealed that these aqueous-based lignin samples demonstrated strong antiviral efficacy against non-enveloped enteroviruses but also good activity against enveloped coronaviruses and tested bacteria, rejoices Professor of Cell and Molecular Biology Varpu Marjomäki from the University of Jyväskylä. - The results revealed that lignins exhibited much stronger antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19, in comparison to the HCoV-OC43 causing common cold. Furthermore, the lignins had inhibitory effects on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, explains Doctoral Researcher Jun Liu from the University of Jyväskylä. By employing a range of classical and in-house-developed biochemical and imaging techniques, the research team was able to investigate the underlying antimicrobial mechanisms. In contrast, transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy revealed that lignin solutions disrupted the structural integrity of coronavirus particles, hence reducing their ability to bind to and infect host cells. Professor of Cell and Molecular Biology Lotta-Riina Sundberg says this suggests that active chemical groups penetrate the cells, ultimately leading to bacterial dysfunction. - Research shows that lignin can be an environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic microbe-repellent substances. The work was done under tight collaboration between University of Jyväskylä, Spinnova Oy and CH Bioforce. Aqueous-based lignin extractions from birch, wheat, and oat exhibit broad antimicrobial activities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world's largest conditional cash transfer programme, the Bolsa Família Programme (BFP), is associated with a substantial reduction in AIDS cases and deaths, especially among brown and black women with lower income and limited education. This was the main conclusion of a study coordinated by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), a centre supported by "la Caixa" Foundation, in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NAIDS/NIH). Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs, which provide financial aid to low-income households in exchange for fulfilling health and education requirements, are a key policy tool for addressing the social determinants of health. "We analyzed data from 2007 to 2015, focusing on mothers and daughters in households receiving Bolsa Família, using a causal inference framework and a robust quasi-experimental design," explains Andréa F. Silva, PhD in the Institute of Collective Health, Federal University of Bahia (UFBA) (Salvador, Brazil) and lead author of the study. The analysis covered 12.3 million low-income women, and explored how intersecting vulnerabilities - such as poverty, race, and education - affected the programme's effectiveness. The programme's impact was particularly significant among women facing multiple intersecting vulnerabilities. These findings suggest that education enhances the protective effects of cash transfers on health outcomes. Brazil has already reported a national decline in AIDS, with the relative incidence dropping by nearly 30% from 2007 to 2021, and over 40% among women. By improving nutrition, reducing food insecurity, and encouraging early engagement with healthcare services, these conditions create a multi-pronged approach to disease prevention. By linking massive socioeconomic and health datasets, the researchers were able to evaluate the effects of the Bolsa Família Programme across diverse subpopulations, many of whom are often underrepresented in traditional epidemiological studies or clinical trials. This is particularly relevant in policy evaluation: public interventions could have a very different impact according to the characteristics and baseline conditions, and of its beneficiaries. In the current global context of increasing inequalities and poverty rates, CCT programmes have the potential to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality from AIDS, especially among populations with multiple vulnerabilities. Our findings show that these programmes not only reduce HIV risks and AIDS-related deaths, but also support progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals in Brazil and beyond."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists at Tsinghua University have developed a method to grow kidney tumors in the lab using cells from real patients, offering a potential new tool in the fight against renal cancer. Their research, published in the journal Biofabrication, outlines how 3D bioprinting technology can be used to replicate the unique characteristics of each patient's tumor. The lab-grown tumors, called organoids, are created from real patients' tumor cells, and exactly mimic their traits. This realistic model provides a more accurate platform for studying tumor development and testing how different therapies perform. The incidence rate of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is increasing annually, posing a serious threat to human health. One of the main challenges in treatment is that many patients don't respond well to chemotherapy, and targeted drugs work differently for each person. Current lab models are often inconsistent and don't accurately reflect how tumors behave in the body, making it difficult to test realistic treatment options. This allows researchers to test multiple therapies quickly and identify the most effective options before applying them in the clinic. This new method could greatly improve how we study kidney cancer and develop personalized treatments for patients. Mao, S., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study shows the glow from tooth whitening often fades within a year, but whether you still love your smile may depend more on your personality than the shade of your teeth. Study: Effect of personality characteristics on perception of tooth whitening outcome in young adults in long-term: a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. Tooth whitening is a common practice, but its effectiveness over the long term remains unclear. Similarly, its impact on psychological and social health is poorly understood. A study published in Head & Face Medicine examined these aspects of tooth whitening over one year to assess how specific personality traits affected the outcomes. People often feel dissatisfied with tooth color, which inhibits their willingness to smile. Dentists often use standardized shade guides to assess tooth color, but this may not always provide satisfactory results. This system has been validated and aligns with the human eye's perception. There is no demonstrated direct relationship between a more cosmetically appealing smile and quality of life. However, personality factors such as neuroticism, conscientiousness, and perfectionism may be more important in determining one's satisfaction with one's smile. In this context, the current study also considered how personality traits might alter the perceived effects of whitening, independent of the actual degree of color change achieved. The study included 50 participants between 19 and 28 years old, randomized to either an intervention or a control group. The participants were evaluated for tooth color, personality traits, and the intervention's psychosocial impacts at three time points: baseline, one week after treatment, and one year after treatment. Both intervention and control groups were similar in age distribution, sex ratio, quality of life, spectrum of personality traits, lightness, and translucency. However, the control group had significantly lower chroma (color saturation) at baseline (p=0.001). Notably, high lightness and low chroma predict satisfaction with how one's smile looks. The group exposed to the whitening gel showed improved tooth color one week after treatment compared to controls. The final chroma value remained lower than at baseline. Translucency went down over both the short- and long-term. The control group showed no difference in either lightness or chroma after one week, but it decreased over one year. One week after the intervention, the whitening group significantly reduced psychological and social concerns but did not statistically significantly improve aesthetic concerns or dental self-confidence. The intervention group did not feel that their teeth looked much better, nor did they feel more self-confident about their teeth. In comparison, controls reported a significant psychological improvement, which persisted over the long term. At one year, the intervention group was more distressed as they perceived a relapse of their tooth discoloration, especially in participants with a detectable relapse (ΔE ≥ 3). The perceived relapse could have increased psychological stress in this group over time. “Preserving tooth color and addressing expectations and adaptation issues are crucial for optimizing psychological outcomes of dental aesthetic procedures.” When stratified by personality traits, the investigators found that people who were more perfectionistic and less neurotic experienced more benefits one week after whitening. These effects were equally strong in both the whitening and placebo groups, indicating that personality influenced psychosocial outcomes regardless of the actual whitening achieved. Personality traits affect psychosocial health more than the actual amount of tooth whitening achieved. People who show less responsible attitudes are more likely to act impulsively and may feel less burdened by the appearance of their smiles, thus improvements due to tooth whitening are less likely to benefit them psychosocially. In this study, participants could not accurately assess the improvements in their tooth color after a tooth-whitening intervention. They often perceived a relapse to the discolored state over time. A strong placebo effect was seen, with participants in the control group showing satisfaction with the color change. Personality traits played a powerful role in the procedure's impact on patients' psychosocial outcomes. Inter-group differences in psychosocial scores were not statistically significant overall, likely due to the high variability in individual responses. This indicates the need to adopt a personalized approach to cosmetic dental treatments, including individualized counseling, to ensure patient expectations are realistic and that patients are satisfied with the treatment provided. The authors also noted study limitations, including the small sample size, focus on a single tooth, potential dehydration effects on enamel leading to temporary lightness changes, and technical challenges in repeat color measurements.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Steve Chang, from Yale University, led a study to explore how oxytocin influences brain activity to shape social behavior in rhesus monkeys and why its effects are so variable. This work is featured in JNeurosci's Central Questions for Social Neuroscience Research Special Collection. Delivering oxytocin directly into the BLA had state-dependent effects; when monkeys were socially motivated prior to oxytocin exposure, the hormone maintained socially beneficial decisions and social task behavior over a longer time period, but oxytocin didn't influence the same monkeys when they were less motivated. Activity in the BLA and ACC was also more coordinated during prolonged social states, suggesting that oxytocin may stabilize communication in this pathway to sustain social behavior. Says Chang, "We previously found that communication between these brain areas is important for social reward and behavior. So, the link between enhancement of this signal and prolonged social behavior was interesting to see." Elaborating on clinical implications, Chang adds, "We have to be more careful and not just use a standardized approach. Even within individuals, there are variations in the effectiveness of oxytocin treatment! It may be important to individually tailor treatments." Meisner, O. C., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international team, led by scientists from the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute has studied around 3000 people affected by the heart disease dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) – a driver of heart failure and sudden cardiac arrest. For the first time, the team found that a person's general health and lifestyle factors; such as being overweight or having high alcohol consumption, contributed to an earlier DCM diagnosis. Our study reveals just how much mutations in this gene raise the risk of developing DCM. That's a good thing for patients because it means doctors can keep a far closer eye on them, and ensure they have early access to medical treatments. We have also crucially shown is that it's not all down to your genes. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and being on the right medications could help prevent or delay dilated cardiomyopathy for decades. Professor Fatkin, head of the Inherited Heart Diseases Laboratory, Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute DCM affects approximately one in 250 people worldwide – that's around 32 million individuals. Clinical factors such as having high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes also increased the risk, whilst having a history of atrial fibrillation doubled the chance of getting DCM. The findings highlight the need for more research and clinical trials to determine if people with TTN mutations would benefit from being given DCM medications before symptoms begin. "There are still so many questions to be solved – for example should we be giving drug therapies to those at risk far earlier? The researchers recruited 3158 patients from 1043 families affected by TTN mutations. It was the largest study of its kind ever done and involved patients from Australia, North America, the UK, Europe and South Korea. Family members were assessed clinically and underwent genetic testing to see if they carried a TTN mutation. Fatkin, D., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A multi-center study has identified critical risk factors that increase the likelihood of death in children with a heart defect who are awaiting or have recently undergone heart transplantation, according to findings published in Circulation. Fontan circulatory failure (FCF) is a long-term complication in children born with single-ventricle heart defects who have undergone a series of surgeries that culminates with the Fontan procedure. While this surgery helps reroute blood flow and extend life expectancy, it can lead to chronic health problems, including heart failure and damage to other organs. Many of these patients eventually require a heart transplant. The new study, conducted across 20 U.S. medical centers, offers new insights into how specific health complications affect survival in children with the condition, said co-author Anna Joong, MD, cardiologist at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. "We have a strong interest in understanding patients with Fontan circulatory failure: how we can better manage their heart failure, when the ideal time is to list them for a heart transplant, and what the risk factors are while waiting for a transplant," Dr. Joong said. In the study, investigators analyzed data from 409 patients who had undergone a Fontan procedure and were listed for heart transplant between 2008 and 2022. They tracked outcomes from the time of waitlisting through one year after transplant. A really novel finding of this study was that patients with low oxygen levels were associated with poor outcomes. The findings should guide clinicians in identifying high-risk patients earlier and considering more aggressive interventions, including earlier heart failure team and transplant referral, Dr. Joong said. Moving forward, Joong and her collaborators will continue to study children post-heart transplant to understand their quality of life and address any functional limitations, she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Pharmacotherapy can help people living with obesity improve overall health, not just lose weight," says Dr. Sue D. Pedersen, MD, endocrinologist and obesity medicine specialist in Calgary, and lead author of this guideline. "The goal of obesity medications is to improve metabolic, mechanical, and/or mental health, and improve quality of life, incorporating treatment goals that are important to each individual patient." It takes the emphasis off body mass index (BMI) and focuses on an individualized approach that uses additional indicators, such as waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, adjusted for sex and ethnicity where appropriate, and the presence of obesity-related complications. It is one of three pillars of treatment outlined in the full Canadian Adult Obesity Clinical Practice Guideline, with other pillars being behavioural and psychological and surgical approaches. Obesity treatment should always be tailored to each person's specific health needs, values, and preferences. Dr. Sue D. Pedersen, MD, endocrinologist and obesity medicine specialist in Calgary The guideline recommends against using compounded obesity medications because of concerns about content, safety, efficacy, and quality. The guideline panel notes that only Alberta recognizes obesity as a chronic disease. "The lack of recognition of obesity as a chronic disease by public and private payers, health systems, the public, and media has a trickle-down effect, limiting access to treatment (e.g., related to medication costs)," the authors conclude.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at City of Hope®, one of the largest and most advanced cancer research and treatment organizations in the United States with its National Medical Center ranked among the nation's top cancer centers by U.S. News & World Report, today published a new study which found that some survivors of childhood cancer are more at risk for serious health issues as they grow older, including new cancers and chronic conditions like heart disease. Our study underscores the importance of partnership among patients, their primary care providers and cancer survivorship programs to ensure survivors receive necessary screening for the early detection, prevention and treatment of conditions, including secondary cancers, resulting from lifesaving treatment. We at City of Hope are continuing to learn more about what health conditions survivors of childhood cancer are at risk for at different times in their life to inform the updating of evidence-based guidelines for cancer survivors." The City of Hope-led study is the first to look at childhood cancer survivors who reached the age of 50, a population that is expected to grow as cancer treatments continue to improve and become more targeted and personalized. Nearly 15,000 children and adolescents in the United States are diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma or other types of cancer each year. The rate of young patients surviving cancer for at least five years is now 85%, up from 58% a few decades ago. To determine long-term risks, Dr. Bhandari, Saro Armenian, D.O., M.P.H., a pediatric hematologist-oncologist at City of Hope Children's Cancer Center, and their colleagues reviewed a national database that tracks about 40,000 people who were diagnosed with cancer before they turned 21. Having overcome cancer at an early age, survivors face new risks when they turn older, the study found. Young patients have a higher risk of secondary cancers and are five times more likely to die from the disease compared to other individuals over the age of 50. Cancer survivors face increased risks for heart disease as well. In fact, pediatric cancer survivors had a higher incidence of heart problems at age 55 compared to their 70-year-old siblings. They were also more frail, had trouble with physical exertion and suffered poorer health in general. There have been vast improvements since then, including delaying or avoiding radiation in favor of targeted cancer drugs and emerging treatments such as immunotherapy and precision oncology. Still, Dr. Bhandari urges greater vigilance to protect against future health problems. "Teamwork is needed to ensure survivors receive necessary screening and preventative care for conditions, including secondary cancers." While young cancer patients faced more health problems as they got older, the study did find a bright spot when it came to mental health. Cancer survivors were no more likely to report mental health issues than their siblings at age 50. "This mental health finding may reflect the resilience and positive mindset of our long-term survivors who have battled cancer," Dr. Bhandari said. "This is a wonderful example of how our patients continue to inspire us as they navigate their cancer and survivorship journeys."
