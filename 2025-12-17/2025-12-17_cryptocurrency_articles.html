                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This situation may open up new opportunities for strategies focused on managing risks. John D'Agostino from Coinbase Institutional observes that more investment vehicles for Bitcoin have made it easier for retail and institutional investors to enter the market, but that detailed strategies are essential for managing exposure and leverage.Bitcoin's price has fallen drastically, losing 36% from a peak of $126,223 in early October, and remains about 30% under that high. Investors have become wary of overpaying for these assets, leading to a more cautious approach.Mining companies like IREN, CleanSpark, Riot, and MARA, which had been popular with investors, have also faced difficulties. These firms are now shifting to AI data centers, transitioning from their original business models. Despite being top performers in the past, concerns about profitability and the burden of heavy debt have negatively impacted their stocks.As the crypto and AI sectors are expected to become increasingly interconnected, energy needs for U. S. data centers are projected to grow. Morgan Stanley suggests that converting crypto miners could help alleviate a portion of this energy shortfall. Brian Dobson emphasizes the importance of looking at mining companies for both crypto and AI investment opportunities.To address underperformance, some firms are focusing on actively managed or hedged strategies. Sigel's VanEck Onchain Economy ETF has performed well by avoiding high-leverage companies. Activist investor Eric Jackson's EMJ Crypto Technologies has created a new actively hedged digital-asset treasury that generates yield without relying on equity or debt.Amidst market fluctuations, Bitcoin continues to strengthen its standing, backed by significant institutional investment. Harvard University's endowment and several sovereign wealth funds are now investing in Bitcoin. MD does not stand behind any specific agenda, narrative, or school of thought.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Their work addresses a critical challenge: simply replacing existing cryptographic tools with quantum-resistant alternatives is not enough, and can even introduce new vulnerabilities or severely impact operational efficiency. This research systematically examines the specific points of weakness within blockchain architectures and evaluates how different post-quantum cryptographic adaptations affect system performance, trust mechanisms, and the overall viability of decentralised networks, offering crucial insights for building truly quantum-resistant blockchain systems. This comprehensive study explores the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, with a particular focus on the critical need for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and improved scalability. Researchers investigated several major blockchains, assessing their vulnerabilities to potential attacks from future quantum computers and evaluating potential solutions to enhance both performance and security. The study highlights the significant threat that quantum computers pose to current blockchain cryptography, as most platforms rely on algorithms susceptible to attacks from Shor's algorithm. Researchers examined various PQC approaches and their potential implementation across different blockchain networks. The study also identifies scalability as a major obstacle to wider blockchain adoption, noting limitations in transaction throughput and storage capacity. Researchers also note the increasing storage demands of blockchain networks, which present challenges for node operators and network decentralization. This research undertakes a detailed evaluation of post-quantum (PQC) preparedness across seven prominent blockchain platforms, selected for their diverse architectural designs and significant presence within the blockchain ecosystem. Researchers meticulously examined these platforms, representing proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, byzantine fault tolerance, and proof-of-history consensus mechanisms, to assess their resilience against emerging quantum threats. The work focuses on identifying cryptographic components vulnerable to quantum attacks and evaluating the feasibility of integrating proposed PQC solutions within existing blockchain designs. To achieve this, the team conducted a detailed survey of each blockchain's cryptographic foundations and consensus protocols, pinpointing specific areas susceptible to attacks from quantum algorithms. This involved analyzing how each platform currently utilizes digital signatures, key exchange protocols, and hash-based constructions, and then assessing the potential impact of quantum computing on these core functionalities. The study then evaluated countermeasures proposed by each blockchain, including the adoption of lattice-based signature schemes and Winternitz One-Time Signature schemes for account recovery. Furthermore, the research rigorously analyzed the performance implications of adopting PQC signature schemes, specifically focusing on throughput, latency, and block interval. The team investigated how larger signature and public key sizes, characteristic of many PQC algorithms, affect on-chain data size, network propagation speeds, and overall ledger growth. The study identifies vulnerabilities within existing blockchain architectures, particularly in consensus mechanisms, identity management, and transaction validation, and surveys proposed adaptations to post-quantum primitives. Researchers demonstrate that simply replacing current cryptographic tools with post-quantum alternatives is insufficient, requiring careful architectural redesign to maintain both security and operational efficiency. Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake in September 2022 is highlighted, demonstrating a shift towards more energy-efficient consensus. 4 minutes after two-thirds of validators attest to their correctness. The emergence of quantum computing presents a significant challenge to the security of blockchain systems, which currently rely on cryptographic methods vulnerable to quantum attacks. This research demonstrates that simply replacing existing cryptographic primitives with post-quantum alternatives is insufficient; a more comprehensive redesign of blockchain architectures is necessary. Researchers determined that maintaining both security and performance requires careful consideration of protocol design and governance, extending beyond mere cryptographic substitution. While acknowledging that transitioning to post-quantum cryptography is complex, the work emphasizes the need for coordinated standardization, hybrid cryptographic infrastructures, and a sustained balance between security, performance, and decentralization. 👉 More information 🗞 Quantum Disruption: An SOK of How Post-Quantum Attackers Reshape Blockchain Security and Performance 🧠 ArXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13333 As a quantum scientist exploring the frontiers of physics and technology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's price has come under renewed pressure after failing to break out of a two-month downtrend. ETH briefly attempted a recovery last week but quickly lost momentum. Weak investor support has pushed Ethereum lower, raising concerns about its ability to sustain a meaningful recovery in the near term. On-chain data indicate that profit levels for both long-term and short-term holders have declined. Both cohorts now sit at similar profitability levels, signaling reduced conviction across the market. This convergence suggests neither group is realizing meaningful gains at current price levels. The reading indicates neither long-term nor short-term holders hold dominant unrealized profits. If the indicator declines further, Ethereum short-term holder profits could dominate, increasing downside risk and reflecting fragile investor sentiment. Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya's Daily Crypto Newsletter here. Active addresses on the network have fallen to a seven-month low. Lower activity suggests investors see limited incentive to transact amid stalled price action. Without renewed demand or catalyst-driven activity, Ethereum may struggle to regain momentum in the short term. ETH is trading at $2,929, marking its third drop below $3,000 this month. Ethereum price's breakout attempt earlier last week failed to hold. While downside pressure exists, a deeper decline appears limited unless broader market conditions deteriorate significantly. A sustained move above this level could allow ETH to challenge $3,131.

Together, the organizations will show how blockchain supports human-centered experiences that aren't only speculative. Polygon Lab's work is increasingly oriented toward real-world adoption: global payments and financial experiences people and institutions use every day. Boys Club excels at translating complex systems into language and stories that resonate. Their ability to communicate why something matters helps achieve Polygon's goal of building the rails for the next generation of money movement. Boys Club will be able to reach audiences who want to be nerdsnipped but not through developer docs. With this strategic investment, Polygon reinforces its commitment to both sides of adoption: robust infrastructure and killer cultural creation. Boys Club retains full editorial independence, creative control, and operational autonomy as a revenue-generating studio, rather than a new content arm of Polygon Labs. They will continue to work across the broader crypto and tech landscape, including with Base, Solana, Aptos, and other ecosystems. An open, collaborative cultural environment strengthens the entire space and aligns with Polygon's belief in a more inclusive, interoperable blockchain ecosystem. These efforts are designed to help people draw a line between what Polygon is building and how it shows up in their lives, whether that means sending remittances, paying or getting paid instantly, or using fun apps, like Polymarket, that are pioneering the future of finance. Boys Club supports Polygon's efforts to expand real-world adoption and introduce new users to crypto through payments, creativity, and curiosity.</p>

Referencing Strategy chairman Michael Saylor's recent remark that his company buys Bitcoin with capital it “can't afford to lose,” McGlone acknowledged Saylor's role in legitimizing the asset during its 2020 breakout, when Bitcoin traded near $10,000. “But much of what the market had been looking forward to has occurred — ETFs, U.S. leaders recognizing Bitcoin's benefits, and broader mainstream adoption.” A Path Toward $10,000 Bitcoin –“We buy Bitcoin with money we can't afford to lose.” Michael Saylor, at the Economic Club of Miami event last evening.I admire and respect Mr. Saylor, and it was his arrival in 2020 — when Bitcoin traded near $10,000 — that helped fuel the 10x… pic.twitter.com/0CDBxCZYYc These remarks stand in stark contrast to the bullish narratives from Saylor and other industry leaders who continue to project six-figure Bitcoin prices in the coming years. CCN asked ChatGPT and Grok to weigh in on the possibility. ChatGPT offered a cautious assessment, suggesting Bitcoin may be exhibiting late-cycle characteristics rather than early-stage growth dynamics. According to ChatGPT, Bitcoin's long-term viability remains intact; however, this does not rule out severe drawdowns. “Historically, Bitcoin has experienced multiple declines of 70% to 85% following major peaks,” it noted. “A move toward significantly lower levels would be consistent with prior post-euphoria phases.” While stopping short of endorsing McGlone's $10,000 target outright, ChatGPT said such an outcome “cannot be ruled out.” Grok, the AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk's xAI, was less diplomatic. Grok argued that much of the current demand is driven by narrative rather than organic usage. “When everyone's already bullish, there's no one left to buy,” it said. “But it would absolutely humble a lot of price targets that sound ridiculous even by crypto standards.” From a technical perspective, CCN analyst Valdrin Tahiri said Bitcoin's decline appears to be nearing its final phase, though not before another notable drop. “The most likely target for its conclusion is between $70,100 and $72,000,” Tahiri said, adding that a strong rebound could follow once those levels are reached. He added: “With momentum weakening and wave structure indicating a lower trajectory, BTC appears vulnerable to another sharp decline before any meaningful recovery can begin.”</p>

The data integrity offered by blockchain can significantly enhance border security measurements through the immutability and transparency of data. Figure 1 depicts the characteristics of data identity; it shows how blockchain technology can also provide an efficient and secure platform for managing border security operations. Some key benefits include immutable record-keeping, secure identity verification, traceability and transparency, streamlined data sharing, and smart contracts for compliance.35 Streamlined Data Sharing: Security agencies and international partners could benefit from secure and efficient data sharing produced by blockchain technology. This streamlined data exchange can enhance collaboration and coordination among various authorities, enabling faster and more effective responses to potential security threats and emergencies. This would enable customs and border agencies to achieve a seamless “data pipeline” from end to end. Permissioned36 blockchains facilitate the secure sharing of pertinent information. These blockchain networks, managed by supply-chain consortia, allow continuous access and updates for all involved parties, empowering regulatory bodies to maintain precise and dependable data while sourcing it from appropriate channels.37 Blockchain technology has the potential to significantly enhance identity management by offering secure, decentralized, and immutable solutions to identity-related challenges. Figure 2 depicts the characteristics of how the technology can work to improve identity management through mechanisms such as decentralization, immutable records, self-sovereign identification (SSI), verification and authentication, and interoperability. Decentralization and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI): As mentioned previously, Self-Sovereign Identity refers to the concept of an individual owning their own identity without the need for central authorities or intermediaries. Using decentralized technologies emphasizes allowing users to manage and control their identity-related information, including personal data and credentials. SSI enables users to store their identity data, selectively share it as needed, and maintain control over its use, reducing reliance on centralized entities. Decentralization, however, broadly refers to the distribution of control and data across a network of nodes or participants, eliminating the need for a single central authority. Decentralization reduces the reliance on centralized authorities, providing individuals greater control over their identity data. SSI empowers users to manage and share their information selectively, enhancing privacy and control.38 Secure Authentication: Blockchain systems use cryptographic methods, digital signatures, private keys, etc., to enable secure authentication processes. Users have unique digital identifiers that authenticate their identity when interacting with various services or systems. This method ensures that only authorized individuals can access their information. Implementing measures significantly reducing the risk of identity theft and fraud is critical. Blockchain's cryptographic security features can play a significant role in safeguarding identity data and preventing malicious activities.39 In 2022, U.S. goods and services trade with Mexico reached $855.1 billion, making Mexico our second-largest trading partner.40 According to the Department of Commerce, U.S. exports of goods and services to Mexico totaled $362.5 billion in 2022, which accounted for 13 percent of total U.S. exports and 43 percent of Mexican imports. U.S. exports supported an estimated 1.1 million jobs in 2019.41 Mexico recently became the United States' principal trade partner in early 2023. Bilateral trade totaled $263 billion in the first four months of the year, accounting for more than 15 percent of total U.S. trade. This data underscores the heightened significance of ensuring faster, more secure, and more efficient delivery of processes today. The 2012 National Strategy for Global Supply Chain Security42 emphasizes the need for efficient and secure movement of goods through a resilient global supply chain system. It highlights collaboration among stakeholders, integration of efforts across government agencies, and enhanced risk management to address evolving threats and ensure continuity of operations.43 Blockchain technology offers transformative potential for customs operations at the Mexico–US border by introducing a transparent, immutable ledger system that securely tracks goods, streamlines documentation, and automates compliance verification through smart contracts. When integrated with Internet of Things (IoT)44 devices, blockchain enables real-time monitoring of goods, capturing data such as location and conditions during transit. This innovation enhances trust, security, and operational effectiveness by ensuring transparency, authenticity, and accountability at every stage of the supply chain.45 Smart contracts reduce costs and administrative burdens while automating payments and compliance processes. Its decentralized structure prevents tampering and unauthorized access, fostering confidence among stakeholders, enabling efficient auditing, and facilitating rapid dispute resolution. Together, these capabilities have the potential to revolutionize cross-border supply chains, making them more efficient, transparent, and secure.46 Collaboration between Mexican and U.S. agencies in border security is essential to address shared challenges such as arms trafficking, drug smuggling, and human trafficking. This cooperation is based on intelligence sharing, joint operations, and mutual respect for national sovereignty.47 In this context, blockchain technology emerges as a promising tool to improve transparency and efficiency in border processes. By providing an immutable ledger accessible to all authorized parties, blockchain enables real-time tracking of goods and automated compliance verification, reducing costs and increasing trust among stakeholders.48 Figure 3 illustrates the key stakeholder agencies in Mexico and the United States that can work together to establish a binational framework to safeguard the border. The US Department of Homeland Security can engage in collaboration with several Mexican counterparts, including the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público), the Ministry of the Interior (Secretaría de Gobernación), and the National Guard (Guardia Nacional). Similarly, the US Department of Defense can coordinate efforts with the Secretary of National Defense (Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional). Additionally, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) can foster collaboration with the Secretary of Public Security and Citizen Protection (Secretaría de Seguridad Pública y Protección Ciudadana). The Department of Justice, working in coordination with Mexico's Attorney General's Office (Fiscalía General de la República), can strengthen judicial and prosecutorial collaboration to combat transnational crime and enhance border security. On a diplomatic front, the US Department of State can establish collaborative ties with the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores). The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with the Mexican Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP: Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público), Ministry of Interior (SEGOB: Secretaría de Gobernación), and National Guard (GN: Guardia Nacional): US Department of Defense with the Mexican Secretary of National Defense (SEDENA: Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional): U.S. Central Intelligence Agency with the Mexican Secretary of Public Security and Citizen Protection (SSPC: Secretaría de Seguridad y Protección Ciudadana): U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) with Mexican Attorney General's Office (FGR: Fiscalía General de la República): U.S. Department of State with the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs (SRE: Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores): Blockchain technology, renowned for its decentralized and immutable ledger system, offers a transformative solution in disaster response and humanitarian aid efforts. Its decentralized nature ensures transparent and tamper-proof record-keeping of critical data, such as supply chain logistics, donations, and resource allocation, fostering stakeholder trust and accountability. By enabling secure and rapid transactions, automating processes through smart contracts, and providing resilient data storage, blockchain streamlines aid distribution, expedites resource allocation, and prevents fraud. Furthermore, its ability to enhance donation traceability, establish digital identities, and ensure data integrity makes blockchain a powerful tool in revolutionizing the efficiency, transparency, and effectiveness of disaster relief efforts.49 Such characteristics could enhance disaster response efforts along the international border in three ways. The first advantage is the transparent and immutable ledger feature. This is what ensures crucial information remains secure and unaltered. Thus, accountability and mitigating the risk of fraudulent activities is enhanced.50 Secondly, blockchain's capability for secure and rapid transactions, emphasized by Zwitter & Boisse-Despiaux facilitates direct peer-to-peer transactions, minimizing delays in delivering aid to affected regions.51 Additionally, its decentralized data storage safeguards critical information redundantly across nodes, reducing the vulnerability to data loss during infrastructure failures.52 Furthermore, the utilization of smart contracts, advocated by the Stellar Development Foundation and Clarke, enables automated aid distribution based on predefined conditions, streamlining assistance processes.53 Blockchain's role in enhancing donation traceability, as outlined by Almaghrabi & Alhogail, ensures transparency in tracking contributions, fostering trust among donors.54 Moreover, blockchain facilitates identification and credentialing, as suggested by the Council of Europe, aiding in verifying the legitimacy of beneficiaries and preventing identity fraud.55 Lastly, the technology's immutable nature supports data integrity and recovery, which is essential for reconstructing critical information post-disaster.56 Creating a shared blockchain platform for securely exchanging immigration, customs, and other relevant data between Mexico and the United States could improve collaboration and decision-making processes related to border management. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency is actively testing advanced blockchain solutions and specifications to bolster its capacity to safeguard American businesses against intellectual property rights (IPR) theft. Blockchain technology could aid in combating IPR violations by allowing CBP to exchange data securely and efficiently with manufacturers, retailers, rights holders, and importers.57  However, to fully harness the potential of blockchain technology at the border, a collaborative blockchain framework between the two border-sharing countries is crucial. By establishing a unified platform, both countries can streamline customs procedures, facilitating smoother and quicker clearance processes for goods crossing the border. Blockchain's inherent characteristics, such as tamper-proof data records and encrypted transactions, ensure the integrity and security of customs-related information, including import/export documentation, tariffs, and inspection records. This technology enables real-time data sharing between Mexican and US customs authorities, allowing immediate access to accurate and updated information on shipments and trade activities. Such accessibility reduces delays and redundancies in customs clearance and helps combat trade-related fraud and smuggling by providing a transparent and immutable ledger of transactions. Additionally, the shared blockchain platform promotes interoperability between the customs systems of both nations, fostering standardized processes and improving coordination in managing cross-border trade, ultimately fostering economic growth and bolstering bilateral trade relations. Moreover, while protecting intellectual property rights remains a vital focus, CBP should also broaden its scope, recognizing that blockchain technology can significantly improve border operations beyond trade. Implementing a shared blockchain technology at the Mexico-US border can significantly bolster efforts to detect and apprehend criminals attempting to cross the border unlawfully. Utilizing blockchain's secure and transparent ledger system allows for the creation of a unified and tamper-resistant database that can be shared between Mexican and US law enforcement agencies. This platform enables the real-time exchange of critical information related to criminal activities, including known criminal profiles, alerts on suspects, and crime patterns, thus facilitating swift identification and tracking of potential threats. By utilizing encrypted keys and immutable records, blockchain ensures the secure storage and transmission of sensitive data while maintaining the privacy of individual information. This collaborative approach could enhance the capacity of both countries' border security agencies to detect and intercept criminal elements, including traffickers, smugglers, and individuals involved in illegal activities, thereby fortifying efforts to maintain safety and security along the border. Blockchain technology offers several features that can enhance the security and transparency of communications within and between government organizations. Data integrity, transparency, decentralization, and encryption are pivotal in developing secure organizational communications. This is essential to prevent potential hackers from taking advantage of crucial weak spots to maintain the homeland's security.58  The immutability of blockchain ensures that once information is added to the chain, it cannot be altered retroactively without the network's consensus. This feature can help maintain the integrity of sensitive government data and communications. Blockchain networks use cryptographic techniques to secure data. This ensures that communications are encrypted and protected from unauthorized access, enhancing the security of sensitive information.59 The transparent nature of blockchain allows authorized personnel to trace and verify the origin and movement of data. This transparency could increase accountability within government communications.60 Distributed ledger technology (DLT) removes the need for a central authority, which can reduce the risk of a single point of failure and improve the resilience of communication networks against cyberattacks.61 Blockchain technology offers promising solutions to the complex challenges faced along the Mexico-United States border. By leveraging blockchain's decentralized ledger system, both governments could enhance security measures, streamline trade processes, and foster economic growth along the common border. The immutable and transparent nature of blockchain offers opportunities for secure identity verification, transparent data sharing, and efficient supply chain management. All of which could enhance the free flow of goods and people across the common border. While blockchain has its limitations and challenges, its potential to transform border management and cross-border trade is undeniable. As governments and businesses continue to explore and implement blockchain solutions, collaboration, and innovation will be key to unlocking the full benefits of this transformative technology. With careful planning and strategic implementation, blockchain has the potential to revolutionize border security and trade, ushering in a new era of efficiency, transparency, and prosperity for border communities on both sides of the Mexico-United States border.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Bitcoin coils near a critical turning point, capital is beginning to rotate toward altcoins with the cleanest continuation structures. Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche are all trading near key technical zones in the short term, but beneath the surface, their setups diverge meaningfully. When volatility compresses at the market level, relative structure matters. This comparison focuses on which altcoin is best positioned to lead once expansion returns. However, the ETH price remains capped below its near-term resistance zone, with momentum indicators struggling to expand decisively. On the 4H chart, ETH is consolidating rather than compressing aggressively, suggesting stability—but not urgency. Meanwhile, MACD suggests a bullish crossover is impending, but as it remains within the negative range, no major impact can be expected. Therefore, the Ethereum price is structurally strong but currently more reactive than leading. AVAX shows wider price swings and less structural clarity. While it has rebounded from recent lows, the 4H chart reveals inconsistent higher-low formation, and daily resistance remains relatively distant. Momentum has not improved largely, but volatility expansion without tight compression often leads to fakeouts rather than sustained breakouts. AVAX would need additional consolidation to build a higher-probability setup. Hence, the Avalanche price is momentum-driven but structurally noisy and higher risk. Price is compressing tightly beneath resistance while consistently printing higher lows—a classic breakout structure. Volatility has contracted sharply, often a precursor to expansion moves. Importantly, invalidation levels are clearly defined, making risk management cleaner. If Bitcoin resolves higher from its own compression zone, SOL appears best positioned to respond with an impulsive continuation move rather than a delayed reaction. While ETH and AVAX both remain in constructive trends, neither currently matches the clarity of Solana's setup. SOL's tight compression beneath resistance, persistent higher-low formation, and controlled momentum profile offer a cleaner risk-to-reward framework than its peers.
