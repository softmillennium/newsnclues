                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gil Gerard, best known for starring in “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century,” has died at 82 after battling cancer. The actor is remembered for his legacy and candor. Gerard died Tuesday in Georgia after battling “a rare and viciously aggressive form of cancer,” his wife, Janet, announced in a Facebook post. The Arkansas-born actor became a familiar face on television through sci-fi and drama, and in an unusually candid later chapter of his life. William Anthony “Buck” Rogers, a NASA and U.S. Air Force pilot accidentally frozen in space and awakened centuries later, in NBC's “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.” The lighthearted sci-fi series ran from 1979 to 1981 and was preceded by a feature-length television movie that became an unexpected hit. Gerard later admitted he was hesitant to take it on. “I saw what it did to Adam West's career with Batman, and this was another cartoon character. I didn't want to do this campy stuff,” he said in a 2018 interview. The series ran for two seasons, producing 32 episodes, and ended in April 1981. In later years, Gerard reflected on what made the character resonate with audiences. “I thought the character had a sense of reality about him,” he said in 2017. He wasn't a stiff kind of guy. He was a guy who could solve problems on his feet, and he wasn't a superhero.” Born Gilbert Cyril Gerard on January 23, 1943, in Little Rock, Arkansas, he was the youngest of three boys. After graduating from Little Rock Catholic High, Gerard studied at Arkansas State Teacher College before moving to New York in 1969. One passenger helped him land an audition for “Love Story.” Though his scene was cut, Gerard worked on the film for weeks and soon found steady work in commercials, appearing in more than 400 ads by his own count, as confirmed by The Hollywood Reporter. Gerard later spoke candidly about lifelong struggles with weight and health. He became the focus of the 2007 Discovery Health Channel documentary “Action Hero Makeover,” which followed his decision to undergo gastric bypass surgery after his weight reached 350 pounds. In a 1990 interview with People, Gerard estimated that overeating had cost him nearly $1 million in lost work opportunities over the years. In a final message shared on his Facebook account, Gerard reflected on his life with gratitude and perspective. For fans of classic television and science fiction, Gil Gerard leaves behind a legacy rooted in humor, honesty, and a hero who felt unmistakably human.

There are many, many wonderful films to get excited about seeing next year, but tucked in safe alongside the big budget event films and off-kilter superhero offerings, there's one bonkers indie gem to get really hyped for. Our own Christian Zilko called it “a glorious copyright nightmare” in his review, which is about as high of praise as we get around these parts. Related Stories Gen Z Went to Movie Theaters Most Often in 2025, According to New Exhibition Report Chloé Zhao, Nia DaCosta, and Geeta Gandbhir Set for Sundance Tribute Awards Enter Neon, who picked up the film in March, and then (very wisely) took it to the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival, where it played to a very pleased hometown crowd. For a film that hinges on landmarks like the CN Tower and the SkyDome, it's no surprise the local Canadians flipped for it, but we're betting Johnson and McCarrol will earn a whole raft of newly minted fans when the film arrives in theaters next February. Hard to say without spoiling some of its best twists and turns, though we advise keen viewers to make note of the flip-flopping logo at the end of the film's first teaser, which quite obviously (and colorfully!) pays homage to a beloved classic film. You'll just have to wait and see. Earlier this year, McCarrol and Johnson reflected on the wild path their project has taken over the years with IndieWire. “I think one of the whole reasons that it's endured is ironically because we were just making it for ourselves. So there was no delusions whatsoever,” Johnson said. “I remember the stupidest we got was when VICE picked it up and we were going to finally make it as a real TV show. I would say that was the most hopeful we were, that people would be like, ‘Wow, people are really finally going to see this show.

In today's batch of “let's all learn more about mergers and acquisitions best practices together” news, the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors has “unanimously determined that the tender offer launched by Paramount Skydance on December 8, 2025, is not in the best interests of WBD and its shareholders and does not meet the criteria of a ‘Superior Proposal' under the terms of WBD's merger agreement with Netflix announced on December 5, 2025.” And, as such, they have advised WBD's shareholders to reject the Paramount offer, while also giving their full support of Netflix's own offer. “Following a careful evaluation of Paramount's recently launched tender offer, the Board concluded that the offer's value is inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on our shareholders,” said Samuel A. “This offer once again fails to address key concerns that we have consistently communicated to Paramount throughout our extensive engagement and review of their six previous proposals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hollywood has cut back dramatically on diversity programs this year under MAGA pressure, but there's a little bit of something for almost everyone in the latest round of California tax incentives for the big screen. Among the 28 projects announced Wednesday, there's a Snoop Dogg biopic via Universal, a Gina Rodriguez-directed feature, a Glen Powell-produced film, and multiple Oscar winner Ang Lee‘s much anticipated return with Gold Mountain. Today's 28 projects are the second feature awards round since Gavin Newsom made official the Film and TV program's mega-expansion to $750 million annually earlier this year. “Big love to the California Film Commission and Gov. Newsom for holdin' it down with that tax credit,” Snoop Dogg said in a statement this morning as the feature film allocations were made public. In many ways, the Snoop flick, which will star Outer Banks‘ Jonathan Davis and be directed by Craig Brewer, is a no-brainer for the CFC-run program — the hip hop icon is literally a California success story from top to blunt to bottom, if you know what I mean? Which may be why the Universal Pictures entry topped this allocation round with a just over $17 million incentive award. Here's the full list, with incentive awards and more: Among other awarded projects, the untitled Sony movie from Powell ($9.9 million in credits), the Rodriguez-helmed Guerrero ($4.4 million in credits) and Lee's Gold Mountain ($7.6 million in credits) display the scope of independent and distinctly “non-independent” films that make up the mix of this round. Put together, the more than two dozen projects in the jobs-centric program are anticipated to employ “4,837 cast and crew, along with 22,614 background performers (measured in days worked),” according to the CFC. “California's film and television industry isn't just an economic engine — it's part of who we are,” noted Newsom in full pitch mode this morning. “For more than a century, the world's most iconic stories have been imagined, produced, and shared from right here, powered by unmatched talent, creativity, and innovation,” the governor and potential 2028 POTUS candidate added. “This latest round of tax credit awards builds on that legacy while delivering real results across the state: good-paying jobs, stronger local economies, and thriving small businesses. It's a clear signal that California remains the global home of storytelling — yesterday, today, and for generations to come.” Speaking of to come, the next application period for TV projects seeking California credits will begin January 26, 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paramount is standing by its current proposal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, warning shareholders that embracing Netflix‘s offer would saddle them with a “heavily indebted, sub-scale linear business.” The David Ellison-led media company conveyed its position in a press release Wednesday, soon after WBD‘s board of directors recommended against the Paramount option. Neither party has changed its deal terms, though it is widely expected that Wednesday's crossing of swords could usher in a new round of competitive bidding, nudging the ultimate acquisition price even higher. Paramount made a hostile bid last week to buy all of WBD worth $108 billion including debt. Netflix has an accepted offer to take over only the Warner studio and streaming division in a transaction worth nearly $83 billion. Paramount said it is “highly confident” in securing “timely” regulatory approval. Countering criticism by WBD that its bid is “illusory” and lacks full commitment from the Ellison family, Paramount said it has “lined up all necessary financing to deliver its offer to WBD shareholders, and it is not subject to any financing conditions.” The company said its offer will be financed by $41 billion of new equity, “backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo.” The Paramount stakeholders “remain committed to bringing together two iconic Hollywood studios to create a unique global entertainment leader,” Ellison said. “Our proposal clearly offers WBD shareholders superior value and certainty, a clear path to close, and does not leave them with a heavily indebted sub-scale linear business. I have been encouraged by the feedback we have received from WBD shareholders who clearly understand the benefits of our offer. We will continue to move forward to deliver this transaction, which is in the best interest of WBD shareholders, consumers, and the creative industries.” Addressing the WBD SEC filing earlier Wednesday, Paramount said WBD's “own narrative of the actions that led to its inferior transaction with Netflix reveals a process which was not run to secure the best offer for WBD shareholders. Most notably, the absence of any engagement by WBD with Paramount in the face of a superior all-cash $30 per share offer speaks for itself.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The move, while widely expected, will likely result in David Ellison launching another, higher bid for WBD. Discovery officially rejected David Ellison‘s $30 per share hostile bid for the company, telling shareholders that it remains “inferior” to the Netflix deal, and carries “numerous significant risks and costs on WBD.” With the rejection official, Paramount will need to persuade WBD shareholders to tender their shares at that price, or to submit a higher bid than its $108 billion offer that would shift the outcome of the dealmaking. “Following a careful evaluation of Paramount's recently launched tender offer, the Board concluded that the offer's value is inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on our shareholders,” said Samuel A. “This offer once again fails to address key concerns that we have consistently communicated to Paramount throughout our extensive engagement and review of their six previous proposals. Netflix's Ted Sarandos Vows to Continue Releasing Warner Bros. Movies "in Theaters With the Traditional Windows" Phil Murphy on New Jersey's Two Big Studios Competing for Warner Bros: "May the Best Team Win" “Doing a deal is great, closing a deal is better,” Di Piazza said on CNBC Wednesday morning after the WBD decision was released. “He guaranteed it through an irrevocable trust at the last minute, and frankly, that wasn't as good as an investment grade company that purported strong value, great response to our concerns of what it took to operate,” Di Piazza said on CNBC. Concerns over $1 billion to be contributed by Tencent forced Paramount to remove the Chinese tech company from its last bid (Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners had contributed $200 million, though that fund has backed out of the consortium). WBD also said that it does not believe there is a material difference from a regulatory standpoint between the Netflix and Paramount deals. Sources say that Ellison and the Paramount team were waiting to see WBD's response before deciding their next move. If Paramount comes back with a higher bid, Netflix will have the chance to match it, or respond with their own counter, effectively kicking off a new bidding war. Discovery Board reinforced that Netflix's merger agreement is superior and that our acquisition is in the best interest of stockholders,” said Ted Sarandos, Netflix's co-CEO. We're also fully committed to releasing Warner Bros. films in theaters, with a traditional window, so audiences everywhere can enjoy them on the big screen.” Ellison already made it clear that he was willing to go higher than $30 per share in a text message to WBD CEO David Zaslav just a few hours before the Netflix deal was sealed. “Please note importantly we did not include ‘best and final' in our bid,” Ellison wrote. On Wednesday, however, Paramount released a statement reaffirming its $30 per share tender offer. “Our proposal clearly offers WBD shareholders superior value and certainty, a clear path to close, and does not leave them with a heavily indebted sub-scale linear business. We will continue to move forward to deliver this transaction, which is in the best interest of WBD shareholders, consumers, and the creative industries.” That text message and regulatory confidence were likely top of mind for investors, with Ellison and some of his top deputies pitching Wall Street shareholders on the company's prospects last week during a UBS conference in New York. Indeed, the all-cash bid from Paramount is appealing to some significant shareholders, so if the offer gets raised, there is a chance that Wall Street pressure could rise on WBD to reconsider. Ellison is likely to respond with his higher bid, but will Netflix keep the fight up? Or will it pull back and resign itself to being king of the streaming heap, with an extra $2.8 billion to help it along? Or as WBD CEO David Zaslav told staff in an email Wednesday:”You may be asking: where does that leave us? The exec added, “That regulatory review process has already begun.” Though Peters told CNBC that, should the price for WBD go up, the company will be “dispassionate” when it comes to determining what to do next.

Netflix's Ted Sarandos Vows to Continue Releasing Warner Bros. Movies "in Theaters With the Traditional Windows" During those tense moments, Cameron did what he always does, literally every day, sometimes for hours at a stretch: “I worked the problem.” The filmmaker has many abilities — as a designer, storyteller, engineer and project leader. My way of stress relief is to think about hard engineering problems on other projects.” He doesn't even like to rely on GPS while driving. Throughout his career, Cameron has essentially asked himself: What's the toughest, most artistically fulfilling problem I can solve that will appeal to a mass audience? Would it be a Terminator sequel hinging on unproven CGI technology for its shape-shifting villain? You know his results: a string of hits and three of the biggest films of all time (the first two Avatar titles collectively grossed $5.2 billion globally — more than Disney paid to acquire Star Wars). But Cameron feels many fail to appreciate the level of artistry and real-world effort that go into making the Avatar films, in particular, and he's not wrong (when I tell a friend I'm writing about Fire and Ash, she says, “It feels like everything is made with AI now” — a comment that would surely drive Cameron up a wall). “We've somehow been lumped in with the issue of AI replacing actors,” he says. Cameron has been emphasizing this on his press tour, and with good reason: Across an 18-month shoot, Cameron would sometimes work with actors for hours before a scene, then his technology translated their every micro-expression into his Na'vi characters. They say it's not ‘real acting' — that's the most bullshit thing in history, [as if] ‘real acting' is stage acting where you're whispering loud enough to be heard 30 rows back.” Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who finds an ally in franchise newcomer Varang (a scene-stealing Oona Chaplin), the frightening, seductive leader of the Ash People. The Ash clan was inspired by one of Cameron's globe-trotting explorations, when he met with the Baining people in Papua New Guinea. I wasn't thinking, ‘I can use this for Avatar,' but it was one of those things that informs my dream landscape.” Once again, Cameron has depicted an alien world stuffed with diverse beauty, wild creatures and epic action-adventure set pieces while largely filming in a single room in Manhattan Beach Studios in Southern California. The film's first assembly cut approached four hours. Viewers at an early test screening were enthusiastic (when asked if they would see the film again, Cameron says the entire audience raised their hands). “There are things that I'll [keep in the film] that are important to me, and there are things where I'm like, ‘OK, that's not a hill I'm going to die on.' He admits some at Disney would have preferred a shorter cut (“There's always pressure — ‘Do we need all this stuff with Quaritch? “There's a wisdom that's a carryover from decades ago that if we can have more [screenings per day], we'll make more money,” he says. “But if you engage people, the word will spread. We proved it with Titanic, which is exactly the same length as Fire and Ash.” Exactly how much money Fire and Ash will make is a crucial question for the fate of the franchise. Weaver says what Cameron has planned for the fourth and fifth movies “is so amazing” that it would be a tragedy for the franchise to halt. Adds Cameron: “This can be the last one. There's only one [unanswered question] in the story. We may find that the release of Avatar 3 proves how diminished the cinematic experience is these days, or we may find it proves the case that it's as strong as it ever was — but only for certain types of films. We won't know until the middle of January.” I ask something that might sound odd: What do you want to happen? Do I want it to be a wild success — which almost compels me to continue and make two more Avatar movies? A few weeks back, a headline was trending on Reddit: “Anyone else feel like it's an unfortunate waste of talent that James Cameron will [spend] 35+ years on Avatar?” This debate has been recurring on fan forums for at least a decade. “I'm feeling fulfilled as an artist, and when [those critical fans] become filmmakers, they can make those types of decisions for themselves — or just stay the fuck out of it,” Cameron says. It's like saying, ‘Gee, I wish she wasn't married to the same guy for so long.' That said, for the first time in years, Cameron is ready to move beyond Avatar. “I've got other stories to tell, and I've got other stories to tell within Avatar,” he says. “What won't happen is, I won't go down the rabbit hole of exclusively making only Avatar for multiple years. I'm going to figure out another way that involves more collaboration. Cameron has gradually expanded the role of his second units and is confident they could shoulder a heavy load if another film is greenlit. Whether Disney would want another Avatar without Cameron at the helm is unclear. “You're not waiting 20 minutes for the perfect sunset,” Cameron likes to say, and adds: “They say, ‘practical [filmmaking] is always better.' Practical is better in one way: It might be cheaper. But I could do the best car chase you ever saw and never put a real car on the road and you wouldn't know.” He points to the sunset kiss from Titanic — where his cast and crew literally had to wait for a sunset. He retells that story with relish: The sky was murky. With only a few minutes of light to spare, Kate Winslet rushed up a ladder to the ship's bow and screamed: “Shoooooot!” The resulting shot — just slightly out of focus — became one of the most iconic in cinema history. “I've never heard an actor yell at me and say, ‘Shoooooot.' “That's a question I've asked myself,” he admits, then pivots to explain how adding imperfection has become part of his process when making Avatar. This is one way digital filmmaking like on Avatar and making movies with AI actually do overlap: They both give filmmakers so much control that they avoid the headaches and limitations that come with traditional moviemaking. He's warned about the technology's destructive potential on a global level (you know, Skynet) and its danger to Hollywood jobs. He recently judged a New Zealand university's short-film pitch session and grew increasingly frustrated when one young filmmaker after another failed to mention their cast. “They were like, ‘Jim Cameron's mad at us,' ” he says. Yet the director also sees a business opportunity within the AI space: launching a company, or tool, that helps VFX houses become more efficient — not to replace artists or offer a “magic wand solution that can create a finished image,” but one that allows professional artists to more easily manipulate imagery. Such an innovation could dramatically lower the cost of moviemaking. (Cameron has done something like this before — co-founding Digital Domain in 1993 to improve CGI.) “People are not creating tools to help us in the VFX realm, they're making them for the average person,” Cameron says. “So I'm going to roll up my sleeves and investigate some development in that area. My other projects I want to do all require VFX. Releasing Fire and Ash during a presidential administration that's unraveled environmental protections, one wonders whether Cameron is frustrated that his eco-promoting franchise hasn't had a greater impact on issues like climate change. “I'm not frustrated that Avatar isn't solving it,” says Cameron — who calls President Trump the “most narcissistic asshole in history since fucking Nero,” and adds, “Yeah, you can quote that” — “I'm frustrated because the human race seems to be delusional about what they think is going to happen next. But who's to say we wouldn't be going backwards even faster if it wasn't for these films? There isn't an alternative Earth without Avatar we can point to and say, ‘It made this measurable difference.' There are, perhaps, more drama-filled stories surrounding Cameron than any other living filmmaker. Maybe it's the time on The Abyss when he ran out of oxygen, a safety diver grabbed him and shoved a broken regulator full of water into his mouth, and the director punched him to escape? Or maybe it's some little-known factoid, like how Cameron secretly wrote his ex-wife Kathryn Bigelow's 1991 action classic Point Break? “I flat out got stiffed by the Writers Guild on that. My favorite (like several of these, chronicled in Rebecca Keegan's excellent Cameron biography The Futurist) is one you've likely never heard. The rat sprang back to life, and Cameron adopted “Beanie” as his pet. But why did a man running one of the most tortuous shoots in Hollywood history, who was reportedly saying things to crewmembers like, “Firing [you] is too merciful” … Why did that guy open his home to a mere rat? “Beanie and I bonded over the whole thing,” he says. He used to sit on my desk while I was writing Terminator 2, and he lived to a ripe old age. He didn't seem particularly traumatized, though I know the film is outlawed in the U.K. because of ‘animal cruelty.' Says Weaver: “He has always been such a sweetheart to me; I have never actually seen [his harsh side]. You also see this side of Cameron when he talks about his late producing partner, Jon Landau, who died last year. Cameron and Landau used to connect 20 times a day. A week after the funeral, Cameron caught himself cc'ing Landau on an email. “It's like when my parents died,” Cameron says. “It's like I've got nobody left to be proud of me, or to judge me if I fuck up. “He believed in Avatar more than I did. This is all a giant pile of shit. I did the screaming, but that was a long time ago. Cameron's sentimental side has been critical to his success. His dialogue is often called cheesy, but a better description might be sincere. With a few comic-relief exceptions (and much of True Lies), Cameron's characters tend to be achingly earnest (critics roll their eyes at Leonardo DiCaprio shouting, “I'm the king of the world!” as James Horner's score swells, but millions of fans felt otherwise). Cameron says he doesn't do “smart-alecky” dialogue, noting it's unrealistic — people in life-and-death situations aren't flinging around wisecracks. He spoke over the sub's radio to his wife, Titanic actress Suzy Amis, and said, “I love you, baby” — an echo of Ed Harris' character in The Abyss messaging, “I love you, wife …” while at the bottom of a similar trench. It was the director's blockbuster art merging with his marriage and real-life adventures in a crazily surreal way. In a rare interview about her husband, Amis recalls feeling “beyond nervous I would never see him again” during that dive, but also loving that Cameron was, “just so excited; like a little kid. He'd been working on it for years and you can't hold that back from somebody.” Amis is a recreational pilot (“my risks are in the air; his are underwater”) and describes their home life in New Zealand with their three shared children as the picture of cozy domesticity. “It's us walking around the house in socks, being voracious readers, building fires, and hanging out — after 30 years, there's never a moment we don't have something to talk about.”When Cameron is back at work, however, the Angry Director of Hollywood lore still occasionally rises back to the surface. Minutes after drafting the above paragraphs about the director's warm and fuzzy side, we had a Zoom call for some follow-up questions. The director had just landed in Paris after days of press junkets and looked exhausted. “All I want to talk about is Fire and Ash,” Cameron snaps. Why would I want to talk about anything else? Do you honestly believe you've heard even more than one-tenth of one percent of what could be said about this project?” When I explained this story is a broad look at the director, Cameron fires back: “Is this a profile you're writing? Cameron won't reveal his next project — and he might even be unsure himself — but will give intriguing hints. In addition to co-directing Billie Eilish's upcoming 3D concert documentary, Hit Me Hard and Soft, Cameron has another globe-trotting documentary adventure in the works, the details of which are under wraps. His next narrative film probably won't be Ghosts of Hiroshima, which has generated considerable press after Cameron acquired the rights to Charles Pellegrino's book chronicling the true story of Tsutomu Yamaguchi, who in 1945 survived the nuclear blasts at both Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Cameron promised Yamaguchi on his deathbed in 2010 that he'd make the film. Cameron says “a lot of people” in the industry have stepped forward wanting to help make Ghosts, but there's no script yet. I point out that even if Cameron employs an army of Japanese talent to ensure the film is authentic — which is his plan — he'll likely still get some backlash for being a white filmmaker telling that story. “I'm going to tell this story — because why? But nobody's putting their hand up to do this. It'll probably be the least-attended movie I ever make. “Once the dust clears on Avatar in a couple of months, I'm going to really plunge into that,” he says. “There are a lot of narrative problems to solve. The biggest is how do I stay enough ahead of what's really happening to make it science fiction?” Asked whether he's cracked the premise, Cameron replies, “I'm working on it,” but his sly smile suggests that he has. The result will be the first Terminator film Cameron has been involved in that won't star Arnold Schwarzenegger. “I can safely say he won't be [in it],” Cameron says. “It's time for a new generation of characters. I insisted Arnold had to be involved in [2019's] Terminator: Dark Fate, and it was a great finish to him playing the T-800. There needs to be a broader interpretation of Terminator and the idea of a time war and super intelligence. I want to do new stuff that people aren't imagining.” When I mention Noah Hawley's AI-themed reinvention of the Alien franchise with Alien: Earth, Cameron praises the FX drama as “great; a lot of fun,” but notes it leaned on the first two Alien films, and that doing fan-friendly callbacks is “what I'm not going to do” with Terminator. Something like that wouldn't be of interest to me.” “Nobody should be operating artistically from a comfort zone.” And that, right there, is perhaps Cameron's best reason for expanding beyond Avatar. There are all sorts of grueling new problems just waiting to be solved, and the 71-year-old has no shortage of energy — partly crediting his vegan diet, which he adopted for sustainability reasons: “I'm eating the way the rest of the human race is going to have to eat in 50 years or we don't survive. “I look at other people my age, and it's like they're just punching a clock, waiting to go.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The Voice” is reinventing itself in a big way for season 29. With a three-Coach showdown, competitive twists in every round, and the return of familiar faces from earlier seasons, the long-running NBC competition is entering one of its most ambitious eras yet. From premiere details to major format changes, here's everything viewers need to know about “The Voice” season 29. The season will launch with three extended episodes during its first week: Beginning March 2, following a March 5 broadcast, new episodes of “The Voice” will air in their standard Monday night 9 p.m. New episodes of “Brilliant Minds” will follow at 10 p.m. Fans can currently watch season 28, airing Monday nights on NBC. NBC announced in July 2025 that season 29 would introduce a special “Battle of the Champions” format, bringing back three of the show's most recognizable Coaches: Kelly Clarkson, Adam Levine, and John Legend. Levine, one of the original Coaches, previously led teams from seasons 1 through 16 and returned again in season 27, earning three wins during his tenure. Legend also returns after coaching multiple seasons, including seasons 16 through 21, 24, 25, and 27, with his first-season victory alongside Maelyn Jarmon standing out as a fan favorite. Unlike most seasons, “The Voice” season 29 will feature three Coaches instead of four, a change that aligns with the revamped competitive format. The original Coach will judge the In-Season All-Star Competition, where returning Artist alums compete in head-to-head sing-offs. Green's decisions will directly impact the finale, as his selections determine which Coach is guaranteed two Artists in the Final round. Reflecting on the show's early days, Levine previously told NBC Insider, “It used to just be kind of crazy. We were like the [Rolling] Stones or something. We were like a punk rock band.” Green served as a Coach during the show's first three seasons and returned again in season 5, later appearing as an Advisor in multiple seasons. Season 29 will feature four main rounds: Blind Auditions, Battles, Knockouts, and the Semi-Finals/Finale. The Knockouts allow Coaches to bring back two fan-favorite Artists from past seasons for sing-offs. Not happy about Adam returning, he's so full of himself, will have to skip this season for sure Wish he was on this new Season!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Them in one fell nuclear swoop was a bust, not because the middle-management types masterminding it didn't do a pretty good job of killing people—they did, with piled-up skeletons in the billions!—but because there's always more Them out there. What if some big, brilliant business brain could find a way to “fix” the bug in our collective firmware? Welcome back to Fallout, which returns to us in season two with a funny, scary, lively, and slightly disconnected premiere that catches us up on (most of) our main cast, while also introducing a few key new characters and themes that will likely weigh heavily on this latest sojourn through the Wastes. We waste no time—give or take a mammoth, six-minute “previously on” recap— in introducing one of these major movers-and-shakers, either, as Fallout tosses up one of its rare title cards to introduce us to the guy with his finger on the doomsday button: “The Man Who Knew,” Robert Edwin House. Introduced smugly smoking in the back of a bar full of tough men striking against his own company, Theroux's House is presented as a sort of Transatlantic Tony Stark, sneering about the triumphs of capitalism, while insulting men much bigger and stronger than himself on the nature of their “obsolescence.” The effect is simultaneously queasy and charismatic: We're trained, as audiences, to gravitate to the smartest, most confident guy in the room, and House qualifies on both counts. But he's also, under the calm veneer, an obvious preening tech-bro monster, attempting to bribe one of the blue-collar workers into letting him jam some kind of mind-control implant into his neck and, when that fails, just sneakily doing the job himself. The façade of confidence slips, for just a moment, when his new cyberzombie seems like he's about to rebel, having already brutally beaten his friends at House's command. But Purnell's ability to make her character's optimism and kindness feel like a deliberate choice, one she makes despite knowing that it's all probably going to end in “a lot of violence,” allows one of TV's most surface-cynical shows to function with a surprisingly bright light at its center. A standard bounty hunter double-cross goes awry when Lucy can't help but stand up and ask whether these drug-addicted psychopaths might opt for a non-violent solution. (“Whoever kills the girl gets to eat the dog!”) And so we're plunged into some pure video-game nerd fan service, as Lucy is forced to fire flesh wounds from her sniper spot in the mouth of a big concrete dinosaur, while The Ghoul starts killing everybody to the tune of Marty Robbins' ballad “Big Iron.” And while my own personal geek brain might quibble a bit at a gunslinger needle drop accompanying an action sequence in which our cowboy zombie killer never actually uses a revolver, the ensuring violence is still satisfying enough—and Robbins' song is such an obvious “Fuck yes!” trigger, especially for fans of 2010's Fallout: New Vegas—then I can't leave the sequence feeling anything but pumped. From there, it's a trip back to flashback land, as The Ghoul reveals that he knew, or at least knew of, House back in his pre-war, pre-nose-loss days. There's an argument to be made here that, given how incredibly spread out in time and space this episode will end up being—we're basically following six different groups of characters who never interact—you could maybe stand to lose at least one of Cooper Howard's flashbacks here in the interest of pacing. (The first one is at least part retread, as we once again see the scene where his wife Barb—now with a shadowy Theroux looking on—reveals Vault-Tec intends to start the war that will not, in fact, end all wars.) But the honest truth is that a show that can go as broad as Fallout frequently does need these moments and the humanity of Cooper trying to figure out where he can take his daughter in a world where the apocalypse is not only coming but has been aggressively branded with his cheerfully complicit face. Later on, he'll meet with our old pal Moldaver, who suggests that Cooper use Barb's connections to get close to House—supposedly the guy who'll actually launch the missiles when Judgment Day comes—and kill him. She seems to read his reluctance to contemplate the deed as a fit of moral compunctions, but Goggins plays the moment closer to bone-deep weariness: We're watching the formation of The Ghoul in real time at this point, including when he returns home and, with lies and heartbreak hiding in his eyes, reconciles with Barb. Elsewhere (and, yeah, there's going to be a lot of “elsewhere” here), we catch up with Norm MacLean in his makeshift tomb in Vault 31, where he's been locked in by former management guy/current brain in a jar Bud, who insists he's only got two “rational” ways out of his current predicament: climb into one of the cryo pods that Bud's been using to periodically decant old Vault-Tec staff—including Norm's dad Hank—to come run vaults 32 and 33, or die. These sequences walk a nice line between comedy and menace, with Michael Esper doing a fine job of making the Bud-bot both ridiculous and chilling—and, ultimately, ineffectual. In the end, Norm chooses a non-rational option, by releasing all the drones from their cryopods on the theory that a brief burst of chaos might be more productive than a long, slow slide into death. Elsewhere, we also check in on the other residents of 32 and 33, and it's here where, had I my druthers, Fallout would be trimming some fat. The show's first season got some decent laughs out of showing how hapless and insulated the non-management Vault dwellers have become after a few centuries of isolation, and we certainly get more of that here, as we follow hapless idiot Reg around on a pretty typical day of trying to feel like anything he does matters. (Since he has a “PhD in party planning,” he probably won't be pitching in on the Vault's current water-chip crisis.) There are decent jokes and character beats lodged in here—the show got a laugh out of me when it revealed that Reg was hosting a “products of inbreeding support group,” and Annabel O'Hagan is having fun as brusquely chipper new Vault 32 manager Steph—but, hoo boy, does it feel like a distraction. Fallout has always struggled to give the impression that it's telling a cohesive story when it has such a struggle getting more than two of its characters in the same room together for anything more than a scene. And it's never been harder to buy it than when we're watching a bunch of characters we barely know make a series of extremely broad incest jokes. As far as first impressions for a season premiere go, it's especially dire: Any urgency we might have been carrying into this thing after last season's big climax gets poured down the drain as we watch Rodrigo Luzzi idly putter about like the comic relief sidekick in a '60s sci-fi flick. (That's after a brief digression for some far more effective Wasteland comedy, when the duo meet a “flea soup” vendor who's grimly happy to supply her own fleas.) It's here (and in the epilogue that follows) where Fallout makes it clear that it still has firm grasp of its ability to blend uncomfortable humor with the horrors of a technologically advanced world, as The Ghoul and Lucy both watch, terrified, as the poor guinea pig mumbles out the message Hank has left implanted in his brain—and then explodes. Even if we didn't get the episode's last big showpiece, it'd be a chilling demonstration of where Hank's head is at these days: The creatures living on the surface are tools, not people, and he'll cheerfully use them as meat to advance whatever twisted agenda is kicking around in his brain. Speaking of—which is to say, [deep breath] elsewhere—we end tonight by checking in on Hank himself, as Fallout reveals one of the very specific legs up it's probably going to have on the show's first season: a Kyle MacLachlan unleashed. We only really got MacLachlan's Hank in two episodes of the show's initial run, and he was obscured from us for most of that, trapped in a cheerful sitcom-dad shell. Here, though, we get to watch the actor channel his inexhaustible boyishness to far darker ends, as he takes up residence in an old Vault-Tec research facility, suits himself up in some dapper duds, and leaves an ominous message for an unnamed “sir”—presumably House—who he tells he intends to complete the “brain-computer” interface. As he speaks, MacLachlan lets the madness slowly bleed through Hank's veneer of middle-management cheer, until we're watching the light go out of his eyes as he promises that “When this is all over, you will be begging me to help you.” It's chilling, effective stuff and the chance to see more of it is one of the things I'm most excited for in Fallout's second season. So it's very much a table-setting premiere, walking through where all of our characters (minus Maximus, who never appears) are at. When the show is cooking—when we're with Purnell, MacLachlan, or either version of Goggins—it's easy to be reminded of what was worth missing about this series in the year-plus since we last got new episodes. When we don't have those anchors, though, it's easy to feel the show veering off the rails: This series can't function successfully for very long in either pure comedy or pure action/sci-fi/horror mode, and when it tries, the quickness with which it begins to wobble can be alarming. This is a pretty good collection of scenes, all told, and my grade for the episode reflects that overall quality.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bill Hader was seen stepping out for the first time since an alleged tense exchange with Nick Reiner ahead of the deaths of Rob and Michele Reiner. The “Saturday Night Live” alum was pictured looking strained while having an intense phone conversation in Los Angeles. Prior to Nick's arrest in connection with the murders, Nick allegedly had a tense encounter with Hader after interrupting a conversation at Conan O'Brien's annual Christmas party on Saturday, according to NBC News — where he also allegedly had a confrontation with his parents prior to their deaths. Nick allegedly stood motionless and stared at Hader before “storming off.” Insiders told The Post on Monday that Nick allegedly “freaked out” during an argument with the “When Harry Met Sally” director at O'Brien's annual star-studded soirée. The insider further alleged that Nick was “badly addicted to a combo of opiates and heroin.” The screenwriter is said to have had a years long history of drug use and violent behavior — once trashing his parents' guest house during an admitted drug-fueled outburst. Rob and Michele were discovered stabbed to death in their Brentwood, Los Angeles, mansion on Sunday afternoon. The director was 78 and his wife was 70 when their daughter Romy, 27, found them at home with their throats split open, per sources for The Post. Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman and Police Chief Jim McDonnell held a press conference on Tuesday announcing that Nick will be charged with two counts of first-degree murder. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. “Today I'm here to announce that our office will be filing charges against Nick Reiner, who is accused of killing his parents,” Hochman explained to reporters. Nick is undergoing the process of medical clearance and will be brought to court to be arraigned, and could face life in prison without the possibility of parole. Rob and Michele married in 1989 after meeting on the set of “When Harry Met Sally.” In addition to Nick and Romy, the couple shares son Jack Reiner, 34. Rob also adopted daughter Tracey Reiner, 61, from his previous marriage to Penny Marshall, who died in 2018.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two models claim their photos were used on billboards for Megan's Hot Girl Summer brand without consent. Two models who posed for Megan Thee Stallion's Hot Girl Summer swimwear brand are suing Roc Nation for putting the photos on billboards without their permission. New York-based models Janelle Delacruz and Tonoia Wade filed separate but nearly identical lawsuits on Tuesday (Dec. 16) against Roc Nation, the Jay-Z-founded music juggernaut that manages Megan. They say these contracts only permitted the models' images to be used in social media advertisements for the Hot Girl Summer swimwear. According to the lawsuits, however, these photos have since cropped up on billboards in Los Angeles and three other U.S. cities. “Roc Nation had a limited license to use plaintiff's likeness from the April 30, 2025, photoshoot,” reads identical language in both lawsuits. Delacruz and Wade say Roc Nation has been “unjustly enriched” by using their images beyond what was agreed to in the modeling contracts. Megan herself is not named as a defendant in the lawsuits or accused of any wrongdoing. A lawyer for the models, Bassil Hamideh, told Billboard on Tuesday that he and his team “look forward to vindicating our clients' rights and trying these cases.” “We consider Roc Nation's unlawful conduct against our clients to be egregious.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He's been thrown off cages, had his head bashed in by the biggest movie star in the world, and forced to kiss Vince McMahon's ass, but former WWE World Champion Mick Foley has finally had enough with WWE. In an Instagram post that begins, “Parting Ways With WWE,” Foley, a longtime critic of Trump, announced that Trump's “incredibly cruel comments” about Reiner were the “final straw.” “While I have been concerned about WWE's close relationship with Donald Trump for several months — especially in light of his administration's ongoing cruel and inhumane treatment of immigrants (and pretty much anyone who ‘looks like an immigrant')—reading the President's incredibly cruel comments in the wake of Rob Reiner's death is the final straw for me,” Foley wrote. Last night, I informed @WWE talent relations that I would not be making any appearances for the company as long as this man remains in office.” Foley also announced that he would not be signing a new WWE Legends deal with the company after his current agreement expires in June. In addition to Trump's long-running friendship with disgraced WWE co-founder Vince McMahon, former WWE President and Vince's estranged wife, Linda McMahon, is currently dismantling the Department of Education. During Trump's first term, she also held a cabinet position, serving as administrator of the Small Business Administration. Since Trump's return to office, her son-in-law, Paul “HHH” Levesque, has increased his presence within the administration, appearing in pro-wrestling-style videos to promote the presidential fitness test. “I am deeply appreciative for all the opportunities they afforded me,” Foley continued.
