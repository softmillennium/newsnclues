                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Frailty is a syndrome resulting from age-related decline across multiple organ systems. A new study, conducted at the University of Jyväskylä, Finland, shows that slower reaction time and lower response accuracy in cognitive tasks are associated with higher levels of frailty. Notably, this association can already be detected in late midlife, among individuals aged 57 to 70 years. Frailty has been linked to several adverse health outcomes, including increased risk of falls, greater need for hospitalization, and higher mortality. "Our findings showed that slower reaction time in cognitive tasks was associated with higher levels of frailty in late midlife, among adults aged 57 to 70 years," says postdoctoral researcher Anna Tirkkonen from the Gerontology Research Center and the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences at the University of Jyväskylä. "For response accuracy, the association was observed across all participants, and particularly among women." "We also found that only response accuracy - but not reaction time - was associated with the development of frailty," Tirkkonen adds. "Moreover, the association depended on which specific domain of cognitive functioning was examined." The findings complement earlier evidence and highlight the link between cognitive functioning and frailty in a younger age group than is typically studied. Our results indicate that these associations are already visible in late midlife and that they vary according to sex as well as the particular cognitive domain and trait assessed."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A review in Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology summarizes the multiple benefits of sport participation for people with cerebral palsy. The authors present a summary of available sports, as well as adaptations, to help clinicians discuss parasport participation with patients and families with cerebral palsy and related conditions. The review provides a practical, evidence-informed resource that can help families, clinicians, and community leaders understand the wide-ranging value of parasports. By reframing engagement in sport as an essential part of development rather than as a luxury or afterthought, the authors promote its broader adoption for individuals with cerebral palsy and related disabilities. "Rather than viewing parasport as an option for 'athletic' children, evidence supports treating it as an essential element of comprehensive care-uniquely combining therapeutic physical activity benefits with social inclusion, identity development, and community integration," the authors wrote.

When they analyzed Medicare claims data for nearly 1.8 million fee-for-service beneficiaries aged ≥65 years in Texas and Louisiana, investigators found that older adults who lived through high rainfall during Hurricane Harvey had a 3% elevated risk of dying within 1 year of the hurricane. Mortality risk was highest among those with chronic health conditions requiring regular care, including chronic kidney disease and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Also, Black and Hispanic/Latino populations experienced 6% and 13% higher mortality risks, respectively, than other groups, highlighting disparities in vulnerability to disasters. These findings add to the evidence that disasters don't just cause short-term disruptions. They expose and magnify the underlying fragilities in our health system.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC), which helps offset a portion of child or dependent care expenses, requires that both parents in married households, or the primary caregiver in single-parent and divorced households, participate in paid employment. Research published in Health Economics reveals that early childhood exposure to the CDCTC may affect children's long-term health in complex ways. The study is based on data from the Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which was started in 1968 with a nationally representative sample of around 5,000 families in the United States and that surveys all family members of the respondents and their descendants to this day.Investigators found that children and adolescents of more-educated mothers had worse physical and mental health outcomes when they were exposed to more intensive CDCTC benefits in early life. An income effect arises because the CDCTC reduces childcare costs, effectively increasing the family's disposable income that could be used for nutritious food, better housing, and other benefits. A substitution effect occurs when the CDCTC pushes mothers into the labor market, leading children to spend additional hours in formal childcare, which can impact child health. This study highlights the need for careful policy designs that consider the varying needs of families with different socio-economic status."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this interview, News Medical speaks with Guillaume Bentzinger, Project Manager at Novalix; Luis Carrillo, Managing Director at De Dietrich France; Philippe Robin CEO of Alysophil; and Alejandro Bara-Estaún, Solution Product Manager at Bruker about how flow chemistry, artificial intelligence (AI), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are being integrated to transform the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Guillaume Bentzinger: I'm a Project Manager at Novalix in the Flow & Process department, with a background in medicinal chemistry. My role in the PIPAc project is to develop and optimize the synthetic routes for producing APIs under continuous flow conditions with focus on fentanyl and propofol. Guillaume Bentzinger: PIPAc stands for “Smart Production of APIs” in French. Our goal was to develop autonomous, continuous-flow systems that could relocate essential API production towards France and Europe. We formed a consortium of four partners, including Novalix, Alysophil, Bruker, and De Dietrich. They each contributed specialized expertise, from synthesis to analytics and automation. Guillaume Bentzinger: For propofol, one major challenge was working with sulfuric acid in flow systems where we had to ensure compatibility with pumps and materials. For this reason, we decided to focus on the synthesis of fentanyl. For fentanyl, we explored both conventional and novel synthesis routes. One constraint was working under regulatory constraints, which required us to build a restricted-area facility and initially explore non-regulated intermediates. Luis Carrillo: Our role was to translate lab-scale chemical processes into a working demonstration unit. The challenge was combining a regulated pharma environment, ATEX compliance, and new continuous flow chemistry processes, all within a 15-square-meter lab footprint. Luis Carrillo: We partnered with FLONOAdditive to design and fabricate stainless steel reactors using metal additive manufacturing. The reactor design allows easy cartridge swapping to adjust residence times. Luis Carrillo: A key challenge was enabling seamless communication between systems from different partners – Bruker's synTQ platform, Alysophil's AI engine, and our control systems. We implemented a market-standard OPC UA communication protocol. Siemens PCS 7 managed the control architecture, with WinCC for supervision. Our instrumentation streams real-time data, coming from advanced NMR analytics and AI use to adapt process parameters, fully automated workflows in line with Pharma 4.0 principles. Philippe Robin: We use deep reinforcement learning to train AI agents that can interpret real-time data from the process, such as temperature, pressure, and NMR readings, and take corrective actions. The selected agents are then deployed to control flow rates autonomously, react to deviations, and even anticipate future trends in yield or conversion. Philippe Robin: Traditional control relies on fixed recipes and operator oversight. Our AI reacts to deviations and predicts them. For example, if there is a drop in temperature, conditions can be adjusted before there is any impact on yield. This level of predictive correction is relatively new and very promising. Philippe Robin: The future leans toward smarter, more autonomous production. AI combined with flow chemistry offers unmatched precision and scalability. With real-time analytics from NMR and automated control, we can enhance efficiency, minimize waste, and respond more quickly to supply chain disruptions. This is especially relevant for essential APIs, where global demand and reliability are critical. Alejandro Bara-Estaún: In-line NMR plays a crucial role in making flow chemistry processes more robust, traceable, and controllable. With instruments like the Fourier 80 integrated into orchestration PAT softwares like synTQ, we can measure the concentration of products like fentanyl and also track conversion, yield, and concentration in real-time. The advantage of NMR lies in its inherent quantitative nature, providing concentration information proportional to the peak area, and its multi-attribute capability. With a single experiment, we can quantify multiple analytes simultaneously, achieving excellent resolution without sample destruction. Combined with AI, this enables a self-regulating, predictive manufacturing environment where quality and performance are consistently maintained without the need for constant manual oversight. As this technology matures, I believe we'll see in-line NMR becoming the cornerstone of Pharma 4.0 facilities. We also had to ensure temperature control of the flow cell using heated capillaries, as stability in flow chemistry is vital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>RNAConnect, a life science company providing next generation tools to the RNA community, today announced the commercial availability of the UltraMarathonRT® Direct RNA‑Seq (uMRT DRS) Kit, a native‑RNA library preparation solution for Oxford Nanopore Technologies® direct RNA sequencing (SQK-RNA004). It employs a gentle 30 °C reverse‑transcription (RT) stabilization step and ultra‑processive enzyme performance to preserve RNA integrity, expand long‑transcript representation, and maintain endogenous RNA modification signals in ONT direct workflow. Direct RNA-Seq requires an initial reverse transcription step to smooth out secondary structures and stabilize the RNA which is then pulled directly through the nanopore and read. Directly reading the RNA strand in this way enables strand‑specific, isoform‑resolved measurements alongside base‑modification information. The UltraMarathonRT Direct RNA‑Seq Kit streamlines this workflow with optimized reagents for current ONT RNA004 chemistry and a low‑temperature RT step that ensures more of each RNA sample gets sequenced. Compared to the existing recommended protocol, this kit's novel chemistry and lower RT temperature (30 °C) result in: We took a hard look at existing direct RNA-seq protocols and saw places where our company's deep knowledge of RNA combined with the unique properties of UltraMarathonRT could boost the output of long RNA reads. RNAConnect is excited to unveil this easy-to-use kit and workflow to enable new discoveries from our vibrant RNA science community." Dr. Jason Underwood, VP of Technology Development, RNAConnect "Long-read sequencing technologies have the amazing ability to access the full span of transcripts that can be kilobases or more in length," added Dr. Paul Boutz, Assistant Professor at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, who was a beta-tester of the uMRT DRS Kit. This was really hampering our ability to see the full spectrum of alternative splicing happening in transcripts, so discovering UltraMarathonRT has been a game changer. The new uMRT DRS Kit seamlessly integrates into the ONT direct RNA sequencing protocol and gives us fantastic results. We will definitely use it for our direct RNA sequencing moving forward."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Electronic medical records (EMRs) have been a tremendous benefit in exam rooms across the country, creating secure patient history databases that clinicians can easily access and update. Yet, they can also detract from the doctor-patient experience, as physicians must type notes into the system rather than devote their complete attention to patients. To help put physicians back in front of their patients - and away from their keyboards - UC Davis Health has adopted an artificial intelligence (AI) scribe, which automatically records and transcribes conversations during medical visits. These systems preserve detailed medical notes so physicians can focus on their patients. In preparation for the digital tool's rollout, UC Davis Health conducted a comprehensive survey to evaluate patient perceptions of the technology. "We weren't sure how patients would respond to these AI transcriptions," said Gary Leiserowitz, Obstetrics and Gynecology chair and lead author on the paper. There was little information from other institutions, so we worked with our patient experience colleagues to understand how patients might feel about it." Gary Leiserowitz, Obstetrics and Gynecology Chair, University of California - Davis Health The survey was emailed to more than 9,000 patients and around 1,900 responded. While 73 % felt they were being heard during clinical visits, 23 % stated their doctors were more focused on notetaking than on them. "A lot of people feel medical documentation is a necessary evil, but hate it when their doctors are sitting in front of the computer, trying to record everything they're talking about," Leiserowitz said. In the survey, 48 % of respondents reported that an AI scribe would be a good solution, while 33 % were neutral and 19 % had concerns. Around 10 % felt it would be bad for physicians and staff. When patients were asked when was the best time during their care experience to be informed that a digital tool would be taking notes, they strongly favored early notifications: They wanted to know while making an appointment, arriving at their doctor's office or checking in at a clinic. Most (57 %) preferred to be notified face-to-face, while many (45 %) were OK with email. Results of the survey provided UC Davis Health with valuable guidance on how to communicate the transition to AI scribe. The team incorporated multiple educational touchpoints to get buy-in, prioritizing face-to-face discussions with patients. "One of our important takeaways from the survey was that we had to educate patients about what the AI scribe could and could not do," Leiserowitz said. Patients can also review and advise their clinicians on possible corrections. Ultimately, if a patient is not comfortable with the system, they can opt out. At UC Davis Health, a dedicated analytics oversight committee reviews all advanced analytics models, including those powered by AI, that are used in clinical decision-making. The committee's goal is to develop a streamlined and innovative approach that ensures health AI is implemented responsibly, ethically and effectively - always with the best interests of patients and the community in mind It helps patients get comfortable with the technology."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By linking gut barrier dysfunction, inflammation, and microbial metabolites to insulin resistance, this review examines whether Traditional Chinese Medicine could offer microbiome-targeted strategies for managing PCOS and why stronger clinical evidence remains urgently needed. Image Credit: HiTecherZ / Shutterstock - Study: The role of traditional Chinese medicine in modulating gut microbiota to alleviating insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome In a recent review published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition, a group of authors summarized how Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) may modulate the gut microbiota (GM) to alleviate insulin resistance (IR) in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and outlined potential, but as yet unvalidated, translational paths for clinical care. PCOS affects 5–20% of women of childbearing age and is often associated with IR, weight gain, infrequent or absent menstrual cycles, and challenges with conceiving. Current pharmacological treatments can be limited by side effects, cost, and long-term safety concerns, alongside concerns about future risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease based on these risk factors. TCM is widely used as a complementary and alternative therapy and is incorporated as an adjunct approach in some regional clinical guidelines. Future studies are needed to elucidate mechanisms of action and to develop standardized, safe, and effective TCM protocols. PCOS is a metabolic, reproductive disorder that involves hyperandrogenism (HA), anovulation, and IR. IR leads to hyperinsulinemia (HI), which causes the ovaries to produce increased levels of androgens, reduces sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in the liver, and alters the neuroendocrine network toward increased production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Additionally, the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis can increase adrenal androgen production via adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Collectively, these systems exacerbate metabolic and reproductive dysfunction associated with PCOS. Emerging evidence suggests that GM may contribute by showing reduced diversity and fewer short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing strains, alongside increased endotoxin-rich organisms, in women with both PCOS and IR. The relationship of IR and HA (created with biorender.com). A healthy intestinal barrier relies on tight junction proteins such as occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) to prevent microbial products from entering the bloodstream. In dysbiosis, permeability increases, “leaky gut,” allowing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to activate the Cluster of Differentiation 14 (CD14), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) complex, triggering myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). This drives tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin 6 (IL-6), which impair insulin receptor signaling via suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS-3) and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), worsening IR. SCFAs and secondary bile acids typically support glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion and metabolic control, but are often reduced in PCOS. TCM is proposed to promote gut-host interactions through five mechanisms rather than established clinical pathways. Third, dietary therapy, for example, quinoa and flaxseed oil, has been reported in experimental models to promote populations of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Faecalibacterium, suggesting potential benefits for women with PCOS. Fourth, probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics may aid in regulating either LH or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ratios or inflammatory cytokine levels, with Bifidobacterium spp. Clinical trials suggest acupuncture combined with clomiphene may improve hormonal and metabolic outcomes compared with clomiphene alone. Acupuncture has also been reported to cause fewer gastrointestinal side effects than metformin in some studies. Patients with PCOS require management strategies that are adaptable, long-term, and individualized. Microbiome-informed TCM approaches have been proposed to include increased dietary fiber intake, targeted prebiotics or synbiotics, and formula-based interventions under clinical supervision. Many clinical trials are small or short in duration, formulations vary substantially, and long-term safety, standardization, batch-to-batch consistency, and identification of active constituents remain limited. The next step is multicenter randomized trials with harmonized diagnostic criteria, validated microbial endpoints, and omics-guided mechanistic studies to identify who benefits, from which intervention, and at what dose. This review illustrates that the GM may be an adjustable factor affecting IR and symptom severity in PCOS. By repairing the intestinal barrier, reducing inflammation and LPS activity, restoring SCFA production, and engaging bile acid signaling pathways, TCM has shown potential to improve metabolic and reproductive outcomes through a combination of approaches, including herbal formulas, bioactive compounds, dietary therapies, prebiotics, synbiotics, probiotics, and acupuncture. However, to move TCM toward practical application in clinical care, larger clinical studies, standardized herbal products, rigorous quality-control frameworks, robust dose-response assessments, and ongoing safety evaluations are required. Accordingly, microbiome-based evidence for TCM must be strengthened and carefully translated into accessible, equitable, and reliable care for individuals diagnosed with PCOS.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Housing is a key determinant of child health, yet relatively little is known about how its quality may affect educational outcomes, particularly the number of missed school days and exam grades, they add. To explore this further, the researchers drew on data for 8992 children, born between 2000 and 2002 participating in the nationally representative Millennium Cohort Study. Housing quality was linked to the percentage of missed school days and standardised test results in maths and English at the ages of 7, 11, and 16 in the National Pupil Database. On average, children missed 5% (86 days) of compulsory schooling (years 1–11). And approximately 16% of them lived in poor quality housing, defined as meeting at least 2 of the 6 indicators. After accounting for potentially influential factors, including parental educational attainment and ethnicity, analysis of the data showed that children living in poor quality housing missed more school days and achieved worse grades than children living in better quality housing. These children missed nearly 1.5 more school days, on average, for each of the 11 years of compulsory schooling than their peers living in higher quality housing (based on 7272 children). Damp, overcrowding, and living in a flat were most strongly associated with missed schooling. Test scores in maths and English during primary and secondary school were between 0.07 and 0.13 points (2-5%) lower for children living in poorer quality housing (based on 6741 children), mainly driven by overcrowding, and to a lesser extent, lack of central heating. This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, added to which data on school absences or test results on at least one data collection point were missing for 10% of the participants. Children exclusively in home schooling and attending private schools (7%) aren't captured in the National Pupils Database. And housing conditions were subjectively assessed by parents rather than being objectively measured. "While study participants were not asked directly about the presence of mould, damp conditions are a major determinant of fungal growth which can in turn release hazardous spores, fragments, and microbial volatile organic compounds into indoor air," they explain. Overcrowding also creates an unfavourable environment for study, they add. "Given the magnitude of the problem in England, national and local public health and housing policies targeting these features of housing quality could improve children's health and school outcomes across the country and narrow the health inequality gaps."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Globally, some 57 million people are living with dementia-a figure that is expected to triple by 2050, note the researchers. Previously published research has primarily focused on the individual associations between physical frailty or depression and dementia risk, despite the fact that both have physiological and pathological factors in common, they explain. To explore the potential interaction between these two factors on dementia risk in older adults, the researchers tracked the diagnosis of any type of dementia in 220,947 participants (average age: 64; 53% women) from 3 large study groups. Physical frailty was assessed using modified versions of the Fried frailty criteria, in which a person is considered to be frail if they have 3 or more of the following indicators: unintentional weight loss; self-reported exhaustion; low physical activity; slow walking speed; and weak grip strength. Depression was evaluated through responses to mental health questionnaires or combined with hospital admission records. Compared with those in good physical health, frail participants across all 3 groups were older, more likely to be female, weigh more, have more long term conditions and lower educational attainment. During an average tracking period of nearly 13 years, 9088 people (7605 in the UK Biobank, 1207 in the Health Retirement Study and 276 in the ELSA) were diagnosed with dementia of any type. Analysis of the data revealed that compared with those in good physical health, those who were frail were more than 2.5 times as likely to be diagnosed with dementia, while depression was associated with a 59% heightened risk. And participants who were both physically frail and depressed were more than 3 times as likely to be diagnosed with dementia as those in good physical and mental health. What's more, a significant additional interaction between physical frailty and depression was observed, with around 17% of the overall dementia risk attributable to these two factors combined. "However, once both factors exceed a certain threshold, this compensatory ability may be compromised, leading to a sharp increase in the risk of dementia," they add. This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. Nevertheless, the researchers conclude: "Given that physical frailty and depression are modifiable, concurrent interventions targeting these conditions could significantly reduce dementia risk."
