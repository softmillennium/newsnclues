                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MANCHESTER, England (AP) — The winner of the 2026 World Cup will receive $50 million from a $655 million prize pool, FIFA said Wednesday in announcing record financial rewards for teams in a tournament with ticket prices that have sparked outcries. The champion's figure is up from $42 million won by Argentina in 2022 and $38 million gained by France in 2018 but less than half of what Chelsea earned for winning the much less-hyped Club World Cup this year. FIFA president Gianni Infantino in 2023 set a target of equal prize money for men and women at their next World Cups — the next women's tournament is scheduled for 2027 in Brazil. The Club World Cup, controversially expanded from seven teams to 32 and shoehorned into the soccer calendar last summer, had a total prize fund of $1 billion. Chelsea won the top prize of up to $125 million for a tournament that faced fierce resistance from players and leagues and drew sparse crowds for some matches. FIFA has a different distribution model for the national team and club tournaments, with the disparity in prize money reflecting factors such as clubs with higher wage costs than national teams. Beyond prize money, further funds are put toward development of soccer globally. World soccer's governing body approved the prize money at a meeting of its council in Doha. Including participation fees, FIFA will distribute $727 million to the 48 federations. Each federation decides what to pay its players. The French sports daily L'Equipe reported France players were in line for a bonus of $586,000 by their federation if they won the trophy in 2022. France was ultimately beaten by Argentina in the final. AP Sports Writer Ronald Blum in New York contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the Parisian club, this match carries symbolism that goes far beyond a single trophy, touching on prestige, legacy, and global recognition. There is confusion, debate, and curiosity around what this match actually represents — and how PSG could still claim a form of global supremacy despite another club officially holding soccer's highest crown. That puzzle is at the heart of this encounter. On the other hand, for Flamengo, it represents a chance to reclaim international glory and reaffirm South America's competitive relevance on the global stage. PSG is still carrying the memory of a previous global final defeat, while the Brazilian side aims to emulate the legendary achievements of Brazilian clubs that once dominated world soccer. Ousmane Dembele, fresh off being named FIFA's Best Men's Player, has been central to the club's transformation. His 35 goals and 16 assists last season, combined with PSG's first-ever Champions League triumph, have elevated the club into a new historical bracket. Here lies the mystery that has puzzled many fans: how might the Parisians become world champions when Chelsea already holds that title? The answer lies in FIFA's restructuring of global club competitions. In 2022, FIFA officially transformed the traditional annual Club World Cup into a new 32-team tournament held every four years. Chelsea won the first edition of this expanded event and is therefore the reigning FIFA Club World Cup champion. A detailed view of the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 Final gold medal According to FIFA regulations, this tournament is considered a continuation of the original Club World Cup lineage, maintaining the tradition of annual continental champions facing off. Due to European dominance — 17 wins in 21 finals since 2005 — FIFA granted the UEFA champion direct passage to the final, reducing fixture congestion and acknowledging competitive imbalance. Kylian Mbappe of Real Madrid celebrates with the Intercontinental Cup This year, Flamengo navigated that path successfully, setting up the final clash in Qatar — a neutral venue that has now become synonymous with intercontinental finals. To address a major concern from the 2025 Club World Cup, FIFA will now be introducing a new rule change in the 2026 World Cup. Cristiano Ronaldo and Gianni Infantino both stand at the center of a controversy that has shaken the foundations of soccer governance. What happened this summer for Lionel Messi at the 2025 Club World Cup has now re-emerged on a much bigger stage, placing FIFA under unprecedented scrutiny. His exceptional performance in the Club World Cup has garnered interest from several of Europe's elite teams. World Soccer Talk, like Futbol Sites, is a company owned by Better Collective.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wilson did not play this season for the Thorns because she was on maternity leave for the birth of her daughter, Gianna. Formerly Sophia Smith, she married Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Michael Wilson in January. "Bringing this new version of myself back to Portland is so special to me because Portland is where I started my professional career and it's where I've really grown up in a lot of ways,” Wilson said in a statement released by the team. I'm excited to get back with everyone and play in Providence Park, to play in front of the Riveters. In five seasons with the Thorns, she has scored 44 goals across all competitions. She was named the NWSL's most valuable player in 2022 after helping Portland win the league championship. A Colorado native, Wilson was the No. She scored three goals in the Cardinal's semifinal victory over UCLA and was named the College Cup's most valuable player. "She is an exceptional global star that can change the game in an instant," Thorns general manager Jeff Agoos said. "Sophia will strengthen our roster's attack as we build on the success we saw in 2025, and we are happy that she will represent and fight for this incredible soccer community next season.” Fans dubbed the front line of Wilson, Trinity Rodman and Mallory Swanson “Triple Espresso.” Wilson, who was also on the 2023 Women's World Cup squad, has played in 58 games with the national team, scoring 24 goals. She was named U.S. Soccer women's player of the year in 2022 and young player of the year in 2017. Get the latest sports news delivered right to your inbox six days a week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ousmane Dembélé became the first Frenchman to win Best FIFA Men's Player since the global award was created in 2016, with a helping hand from the United States men's national team. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC Every year, FIFA releases the detailed breakdown of who voted for whom, meaning that we know which direction USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino and captain Tim Ream went in—they each had to name a top three that helped influence who won took home the prize. Pochettino and Ream both gave Dembélé their first place vote. There may have been some PSG solidarity from Pochettino due to his attachment to the club as a player (2001–03) and manager (2021–22), although Dembélé's achievements last season stack up on their own anyway. His 51 goals and assists were pivotal to PSG winning a treble completed by Champions League glory. Pochettino and Ream also voted the same way for second place: Mbappé. The former opted for Harry Kane, whose rise he oversaw at Tottenham Hotspur a decade ago, while the latter chose PSG left back Nuno Mendes. On the surface it was a slightly strange choice, but 62 others also included Mendes somewhere in their top three. McIntrye's top pick was Yamal, chosen by neither Pochettino, nor Ream. His third vote went to Barcelona attacker Raphinha, who was voted for 104 times in total but didn't feature in the separately decided Best FIFA Men's 11, much to the disdain of his wife. The U.S. trio also got votes in the best coach and goalkeeper categories as well, unanimously agreeing on Luis Enrique and Gianluigi Donnarumma respectively. Barcelona and Spain's Aitana Bonmatí three-peated the award after previous wins in 2023 and 2024, but didn't get any support from USWNT manager Emma Hayes, or captain Lindsey Heaps. In first place, Hayes and Heaps both picked Arsenal midfielder Mariona Caldentey, who finished second in the final standings. Hayes chose Alessia Russo second and Kansas City Current's Temwa Chawinga third, while Heaps put OL Lyonnes teammate Melchie Dumornay second and Russo third. In the coach stakes, all three ranked England manager Sarina Wiegman top of their list, as she claimed an astonishing fifth FIFA crown off the back of Euro 2025 last summer. For the goalkeeper award, where only first and second place was needed, Heaps and Hayes opted for Hannah Hampton top, but Kassouf chose Gotham FC stopper Ann-Katrin Berger instead.

By comparison, the Club World Cup, which was controversially expanded from seven teams to 32 and shoehorned into the soccer calendar, had a total prize fund of $1 billion. FIFA has a different distribution model for the two tournaments, with the disparity in prize money reflecting factors such as clubs overseeing much higher costs through wages than national teams.

World soccer's governing body approved the prize money for every stage of the World Cup at a meeting of its council in Doha. The lowest prize money will be $9 million and all 48 participating nations will get $1.5 million to cover what FIFA describes as "preparation costs." FIFA said, in all, $727 million would be distributed to the soccer federations participating. It is not known how each nation will distribute the money, but at the last World Cup, French sports daily L'Equipe reported France players were in line for a bonus of $586,000 by their federation if they won the trophy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earlier this month, U.S. Soccer unveiled "Never Chase Reality," the USMNT's official 2026 World Cup campaign. In a 90-second video unveiling the campaign, "Saturday Night Live" cast member Marcello Hernandez explains what the slogan is meant to convey. "Reality says the odds are stacked against us, to think our men can ever raise the world's biggest trophy. "But here's the thing about us: Refusing to accept reality is kind of our thing. "Reality told us not to dream, but we stand united chasing the legacy. "When the world says we won't, our fans say: 'I believe that we will win.' "We haven't lifted every men's trophy yet, but we have carried this fight for decades with enough grit to make the doubters eat their words. On her podcast "A Touch More," U.S. women's national team legend Rapinoe admitted that the message wasn't quite resonating with her. “The team's slogan going into the World Cup, this was like their drop, and their slogan is ‘Never chase reality.' I was like, guys, I don't think it's saying what you think it's saying,” Rapinoe said. “I'm kinda like, why didn't we just stick with, ‘Dream big?' So, I didn't like that.” The USMNT has only won one World Cup knockout match in its history, which came against Mexico in 2002. Should the U.S. match that team's achievement of making the quarterfinal, it would have to win two knockout games next summer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This summer, as the world gathers to celebrate the FIFA World Cup 2026, fans can play a newly reimagined FIFA football simulation game exclusively on Netflix Games. The game, developed and published by Delphi Interactive, allows Netflix members to experience the emotion and drama of the tournament in its purest, most joyful form — in a format that's fast to learn, thrilling to master, and built for anyone to jump in. “The FIFA World Cup is going to be the cultural event of 2026, and now fans will be able to celebrate their fandom by bringing the game right into their living rooms,” said Alain Tascan, President of Games at Netflix. “We want to bring football back to its roots with something everyone can play with just the touch of a button.” This major collaboration is a key milestone in FIFA's commitment to innovation in the football gaming space, which aspires to reach billions of football fans of all ages everywhere in the world and will be redefining the pure notion of simulation games. Our mission is simple: Make the FIFA game the most fun, approachable, and global football game ever created.” Andy Kleinman, President of Delphi Interactive, adds, “Together with FIFA and Netflix Games, Delphi is building a game worthy of the world's favorite sport — a game that anyone, anywhere, can pick up and instantly feel the magic of football.” Millions of people already watch Netflix on their TVs, and now you can play games there too. The new FIFA game will join recently released titles as part of a suite of games that Netflix members can find on their TVs, right alongside their favorite shows and movies, using their phones as a controller. Consider this the opening whistle — more details arrive in 2026. This game will be available on select TVs in certain countries, with plans to roll out further over time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo has set a date for his return to training after completing a spiritual pilgrimage to Israel. The Uruguayan international, who was granted indefinite leave to cope with significant mental health struggles following a traumatic period on the pitch, has informed the club he intends to report back for duty on December 29 with an eye on the Catalan derby. After weeks of uncertainty surrounding his future and well-being, the 26-year-old has communicated his plans to head coach Hansi Flick and the Barcelona hierarchy. Following a high-profile error and red card against Chelsea in the Champions League - an incident that sparked a ferocious backlash from fans and media alike - the centre-back reportedly suffered from anxiety and panic attacks. Recognising that he could not perform, he requested, and was immediately granted, a leave of absence to prioritise his mental health. In search of peace, the devout Christian embarked on a spiritual journey to Israel. Reports suggest the defender has returned feeling "progressively better" and mentally stronger, convinced that he is ready to face the pressures of elite football once again.

This will give him a handful of sessions to prove his fitness to Hansi Flick before Barcelona's first fixture of 2026. Ambitiously, Araujo has reportedly set his sights on the Catalan derby against Espanyol on January 3 as his comeback match. While it remains to be seen if Flick will throw him straight back into the cauldron of a local derby, the player's desire to be available is a massive boost for a squad that has had to adapt without its defensive leader.

President Joan Laporta and Hansi Flick have publicly defended their captain, emphasising that the human being comes before the footballer. The club had refused to put a timeline on his recovery, asserting he could take as long as necessary. Araujo's decision to return so soon is a testament to his resilience, but the club will likely manage his reintegration with extreme care.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City have offered an update on the club's 115 FFP charges amid talk a verdict could be returned imminently. The Cityzens are still yet to discover if they will face sanctions after being slapped with the charges for allegedly breaching financial rules during a nine year period between 2009 and 2018. The hearing into Manchester City's alleged rule breaches began back in September 2024 and lasted for 10 weeks. Premier League chief executive officer Richard Master has told BBC Sport: "There is no happy alternative to enforcing the rules, it goes to the integrity of the competition - it goes ultimately to value - and that principle shouldn't be defrayed in any way by being too difficult, too complex, or too costly." As the long wait for an outcome continues, speculation has raged about possible punishments that could be handed down to City if they are found guilty. There has been talk that the club could be stripped of their titles, handed a drastic points deduction, or even face expulsion from the league. Manchester City have offered an update on the situation in their financial report released this week. Consequently, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis."

A verdict on Manchester City's FFP charges feels overdue for many football fans who have following the saga with interest. He said on talkSPORT alongside fellow pundit and ex-Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan: "I think Simon [Jordan] thinks it's going to come out next year, I think it still could come out before Christmas. The decision has been imminent for quite some time, there's not a lot that they can do. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Manchester City are expected to appeal any unfavourable outcome and could also claim damages if they win, two scenarios which will only create further litigation and cause further delays. Meanwhile, other clubs may also seek compensation and turn to the law if City are sanctioned. Barrister Yasin Patel told BBC Sport what to expect: "Whatever comes out of it, I'm afraid that's not the end of the title race for both parties here. Whatever verdict comes out, I wouldn't think that's the end of it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Trump has signed a proclamation widening his administration's ongoing travel restrictions to include the 2026 World Cup participants Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal. Football fans from the two African nations may now face strict checks arriving into the United States of America for next summer's tournament. The US travel ban list now totals 39 countries as a result, with a White House statement clarifying Cote D'Ivoire and Senegal are subject to "partial restrictions and entry limitations," which is currently the least restrictive category. This can be compared to two other World Cup participants on the travel ban list, Haiti and Iran, who are subject to the most stringent restrictions possible. Trump's proclamation has also cited athletes from the two countries, as well as diplomats and "individuals whose entry serves US national interests", as a group who will be exempt from travel restrictions. The 2026 World Cup is to be co-hosted across the United States, Canada and Mexico between June 11 and July 19, 2026. Two of Cote d'Ivoire's three Group E matches against Ecuador and Curacao are scheduled to take place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with the third against Germany booked in for Toronto, Canada. Similarly, Senegal have two group stage fixtures against France and Norway which will be hosted in New Jersey, whilst their third against an undetermined play-off winner will be Toronto. They are also set to be one of the US Mens National Team's final warm-up opponents in a friendly agreed to take place in Charlotte, North Carolina, next May. Earlier in December, the Trump administration's World Cup taskforce, chaired by Andrew Giuliani, unveiled a fast-track visa system for visitors attending the World Cup. Huge scrutiny has also been placed on the tournament several months before its start date due to the exorbitant ticket prices FIFA are charging for games in their dynamic pricing model. Following backlash football's governing body have released a new set of cut-price World Cup at a fixed cost of £45.
